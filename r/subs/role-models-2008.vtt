00:50.765 --> 00:52.790
Thanks for everything.

00:58.507 --> 01:00.600
Guess what I did
last night.

01:01.443 --> 01:02.569
Dude!

01:24.001 --> 01:25.799
Now let's rock
Westside Academy!

01:33.845 --> 01:35.437
<i>Taste the beast!</i>

01:36.182 --> 01:37.774
<i>You can do
anything you want in life</i>

01:37.883 --> 01:40.012
<i>as long as you stay
away from drugs.</i>

01:40.185 --> 01:41.780
<i>Why would a person
use illegal drugs?</i>

01:41.954 --> 01:43.683
<i>Many reasons.</i>

01:43.789 --> 01:46.224
<i>Maybe they're trying to fit in
with a new group of friends.</i>

01:46.326 --> 01:47.623
<i>Maybe they're curious.</i>

01:47.794 --> 01:49.125
<i>Maybe they're just bored.</i>

01:49.229 --> 01:50.196
<i>But whatever the reason,</i>

01:50.297 --> 01:52.424
<i>what should you say when
someone offers you drugs?</i>

01:52.833 --> 01:55.301
<i>Say, " No, thanks.
I'll have a Minotaur."</i>

01:55.402 --> 01:57.030
Stay off drugs! Minotaur!

01:57.205 --> 01:58.832
<i>Thank you, Minotaur man.</i>

02:00.842 --> 02:02.901
Hey! Nice cow
outfit, homo.

02:03.010 --> 02:05.502
Where can I pick one of
those up, the gay zoo?

02:05.614 --> 02:07.047
Oh, no. It's not a...
It's not a cow.

02:07.149 --> 02:08.173
It's a minotaur.

02:08.282 --> 02:09.341
It's a creature of myth,

02:09.451 --> 02:11.385
and he got this one out
of your mom's closet.

02:11.487 --> 02:14.183
She let me keep it
after I fucked her.

02:15.992 --> 02:18.756
Drugs are bad.
Energy drinks, good.

02:18.862 --> 02:21.387
<i>So whenever you'd like to
taste one, help yourselves.</i>

02:21.498 --> 02:24.126
<i>And for every can sold,
Minotaur will make a donation</i>

02:24.234 --> 02:26.169
<i>to the Keep Kids
Off Drugs foundation.</i>

02:31.108 --> 02:33.235
God, this suit
smells like Tater Tots.

02:33.344 --> 02:35.677
Yeah, I know what you need.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.112
Kiss?
Are you kidding? No. God.

02:39.217 --> 02:40.206
I love Kiss.

02:40.385 --> 02:41.374
No one loves Kiss.

02:41.486 --> 02:43.010
Paul Stanley is
sick of Kiss.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.282
Whoa! Don't dis
the Starchild.

02:45.391 --> 02:46.688
Hey, don't get me
wrong, all right?

02:46.792 --> 02:50.455
I like to "rock 'n' roll all
night and part of every day!"

02:51.063 --> 02:53.691
Party every day. "Rock 'n' roll
all night and party every day!"

02:53.799 --> 02:56.428
I like to rock 'n' roll part
of every day. Party every day.

02:56.537 --> 02:57.902
I usually have errands.
Party.

02:58.005 --> 03:00.496
I can rock 'n' roll from, like,
1:00 to 3:00. You need to party.

03:01.842 --> 03:02.900
<i>Hey, guys.
How's it going?</i>

03:03.010 --> 03:05.069
<i>When someone offers you some
illegal drugs, what do you say?</i>

03:05.178 --> 03:07.807
<i>You say, " No, thanks.
I'll just have a Minotaur."</i>

03:07.916 --> 03:09.440
<i>I've had so many
of these things.</i>

03:09.617 --> 03:11.175
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

03:11.286 --> 03:12.844
<i>I may wet my pants.
Where's the bathroom?</i>

03:17.126 --> 03:18.150
Holy shit.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.387
Dude, this is like
Shrek's piss.

03:22.431 --> 03:25.799
<i>So remember, stay off drugs,
drink Minotaur and above all...</i>

03:25.902 --> 03:27.164
Taste the beast!

03:34.077 --> 03:35.306
You know what's
great about this job?

03:35.413 --> 03:36.710
You mean,
besides nothing?

03:36.814 --> 03:37.974
We're making
the world a better place.

03:38.082 --> 03:39.174
How?

03:39.283 --> 03:42.309
You know, giving the kids an
energy boost to stay off drugs.

03:42.420 --> 03:45.481
We're selling them nuclear
horse piss for 6 bucks a can.

03:45.591 --> 03:47.354
What an accomplishment.
Feels good, doesn't it?

03:47.459 --> 03:49.723
Easy to do hung-over.

03:49.828 --> 03:51.090
I could do
this job forever.

03:51.196 --> 03:53.630
If I had to do this job forever,
I'd put a bullet in my head.

03:53.732 --> 03:55.098
Game face, bro.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.259
Surprise!

03:57.503 --> 03:58.629
Yeah!

03:59.405 --> 04:01.066
Got you, man! Got you!

04:01.174 --> 04:02.198
Happy anniversary!
Did you know?

04:02.308 --> 04:03.297
No.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.876
All right.
That was good!

04:04.978 --> 04:06.105
Oh, my God.
You're here.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.271
Wheeler called me. Hi.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.405
Thank you for warning me.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.642
Hey, I tried to tell them
you don't like surprises,

04:10.751 --> 04:13.151
but they really wanted
to celebrate your milestone.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.777
<i>What's up, mino-tards?</i>

04:16.391 --> 04:17.483
What's up, Wheeler?

04:17.659 --> 04:18.750
<i>My dick!</i>

04:18.860 --> 04:20.088
"My dick!"

04:20.195 --> 04:22.663
<i>Everybody, we're here to
celebrate my best friend, Danny!</i>

04:22.764 --> 04:24.425
We just work together.
Not "best friend."

04:24.532 --> 04:25.659
Be nice.

04:25.768 --> 04:27.463
<i>Danny's been
working here 10 years!</i>

04:27.570 --> 04:29.094
<i>That's almost
a decade of living the dream.</i>

04:29.205 --> 04:30.263
You're the
man, Danny!

04:30.373 --> 04:31.806
<i>I want to grow
old with you, Danny.</i>

04:31.907 --> 04:33.169
<i>Hopefully,
we'll be tasting the beast</i>

04:33.275 --> 04:34.469
<i>for the rest of
our lives together!</i>

04:34.577 --> 04:36.102
Yeah!
- All right!

04:37.314 --> 04:41.080
<i>It's early morning
The sun come out</i>

04:41.218 --> 04:43.379
<i>Last night was shaking
And pretty loud</i>

04:43.487 --> 04:44.647
This is a nightmare.

04:44.755 --> 04:46.519
Come on. I took
the afternoon off.

04:46.624 --> 04:48.683
There's cake! Let's
try and enjoy ourselves.

04:48.793 --> 04:51.261
<i>Mitch from Graphics,
take over!</i>

04:51.362 --> 04:52.761
Do it!
- Let's go next!

04:52.864 --> 04:54.491
Come on. It'll be fun.
No.

04:54.599 --> 04:56.625
Why not? Come on.
We'll do a duet!

04:56.735 --> 04:58.293
Getting up in front
of a group of people

04:58.404 --> 05:00.201
and singing is not my
idea of fun. All right?

05:00.305 --> 05:01.932
It's humiliating.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.474
<i>With another sin</i>

05:03.575 --> 05:05.009
I'm gonna sing.

05:06.813 --> 05:08.440
<i>Here I am</i>

05:08.548 --> 05:09.572
<i>Ow!</i>

05:09.683 --> 05:12.550
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

05:12.786 --> 05:14.617
Come on, come on, come
on, come on! Yeah, yeah!

05:14.721 --> 05:15.916
<i>Here I am</i>

05:16.023 --> 05:17.354
Come on. Sing it!

05:17.491 --> 05:20.051
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

05:20.161 --> 05:21.355
Danny?

05:22.196 --> 05:23.288
What is your problem?

05:23.397 --> 05:24.386
Look, I'm sorry,
all right?

05:24.498 --> 05:27.400
I'm not Wheeler, happy
in some brainless job,

05:27.502 --> 05:28.560
no goals, no ambition.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.262
Hey, you don't know
how Wheeler feels.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.569
For all you know, he hates
his job as much as you do.

05:33.675 --> 05:35.610
I love this job!

05:35.712 --> 05:37.771
Hey, Wheeler!
She's tasting your beast!

05:41.250 --> 05:42.774
Good morning.
Can I take your order?

05:42.885 --> 05:44.216
Can I get a tall chai?

05:44.387 --> 05:45.753
And a large black coffee.

05:45.856 --> 05:46.754
A what?

05:46.924 --> 05:47.856
Large black coffee.

05:47.958 --> 05:48.982
<i>Do you mean a venti?</i>

05:49.093 --> 05:50.082
No, I mean a large.

05:50.194 --> 05:52.253
<i>He means a venti.
Yeah, the biggest one you've got.</i>

05:52.362 --> 05:53.522
<i>Venti is large.</i>

05:53.630 --> 05:54.757
<i>No. Venti is 20.</i>

05:54.866 --> 05:55.890
Danny.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.231
Yeah. "Large" is large.
In fact, "tall" is large.

05:59.337 --> 06:01.305
<i>And grande is
Spanish for large.</i>

06:01.406 --> 06:03.203
<i>Venti is the only one
that doesn't mean large.</i>

06:03.308 --> 06:04.833
It's also the only
one that's Italian.

06:04.944 --> 06:07.435
Congratulations!
You're stupid in three languages.

06:07.546 --> 06:09.946
<i>Look, dick.
Venti is a large coffee.</i>

06:10.049 --> 06:11.482
Really? Says who?
Fellini?

06:11.584 --> 06:12.949
How much is that?
Here's a 10.

06:13.052 --> 06:14.611
Do you accept lira,
or is it all euros now?

06:14.721 --> 06:16.552
You know what,
just keep the change.

06:16.656 --> 06:18.624
Jesus, Dan. You know what
they call the sizes here.

06:18.725 --> 06:20.249
You know what, you've been
picking fights with everybody.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.225
The girl at the party...
She said ASAP.

06:22.329 --> 06:24.024
ASAP, I'm sorry.
Huge crime.

06:24.131 --> 06:27.192
It's like "24/7" or "been there,
done that." You hate that, too.

06:27.301 --> 06:30.498
I don't hate it enough
to let it ruin my day.

06:30.605 --> 06:34.006
It's getting worse.
You know, man? The sun is shining,

06:34.108 --> 06:37.078
but you have lost the ability
to take any joy in life.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.771
I can't stand it anymore!

06:38.947 --> 06:40.539
You're just
a miserable dick now!

06:40.649 --> 06:41.877
You're mean to everybody!

06:41.984 --> 06:45.477
<i>And, FYI, it's called a
venti because it's 20 ounces!</i>

06:45.889 --> 06:47.481
<i>20! Venti!</i>

06:52.896 --> 06:54.329
Is that true?

06:56.567 --> 06:58.865
She says I take
no joy in life.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.394
I can see that.

07:02.006 --> 07:03.234
I gotta talk to her.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.638
Forget her, man.

07:04.743 --> 07:06.540
Let me give you a little
motto I live my life by,

07:06.645 --> 07:08.135
you got to hit
it and quit it.

07:08.246 --> 07:10.111
No ties, tangle free.

07:10.215 --> 07:11.443
Nobody tells me what to do.

07:11.550 --> 07:13.484
I go bang,
bang, bang the drum.

07:13.585 --> 07:15.019
What? That's not a motto.

07:15.121 --> 07:17.487
That's just you
saying a bunch of things.

07:17.590 --> 07:19.615
You know, Beth's right.
I'm a dick.

07:19.725 --> 07:22.250
Hey, I'm in a rut, just
going from school to school

07:22.361 --> 07:24.922
selling poison to
our nation's youth.

07:25.032 --> 07:27.091
It's not poison.
It's got juice in it.

07:27.201 --> 07:28.293
You know, I'm 35 years old.

07:28.402 --> 07:29.426
I got nothing to
show for my life.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.003
I figured I'd be something,

07:31.104 --> 07:33.504
something good,
a professor, engineer.

07:33.607 --> 07:35.041
I don't know.

07:35.143 --> 07:37.373
Figured I'd be
married. I'd...

07:41.549 --> 07:43.210
You know what? We're making a detour.
- What?

07:43.318 --> 07:44.411
We're making a detour.
Where?

07:44.520 --> 07:45.817
We're making a detour.
Why?

07:48.958 --> 07:51.153
Dude, you're too jacked up on
Minotaur. This is a mistake.

07:51.260 --> 07:52.784
It's fine. Look,
I'll be right back.

07:52.895 --> 07:55.160
Hey, we gotta be at the Blue
Valley Middle School by 1:30.

07:55.265 --> 07:56.493
Yep!

07:56.600 --> 07:58.295
No, I don't want
to plea-bargain.

07:58.401 --> 07:59.459
I didn't do it.

07:59.569 --> 08:02.231
Mr. Garvin, I just don't know what
other options we have, you know,

08:02.339 --> 08:05.741
because they have this clear
videotape of you stealing

08:05.843 --> 08:07.470
<i>a lot of TVs.
Guys! Go, go, go.</i>

08:07.578 --> 08:08.977
That could be any bald guy.

08:09.080 --> 08:12.311
<i>Look at me. Me, David Garvin,
stealing TVs.</i>

08:12.416 --> 08:13.849
<i>Who would believe it?</i>

08:13.951 --> 08:15.886
That is not me.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.783
Hey, hi.
I need to talk to you.

08:18.891 --> 08:21.416
Danny, I'm with a client,
so we'll talk later.

08:21.526 --> 08:23.323
I can go.
No, no. You stay.

08:23.428 --> 08:26.455
I'm not going anywhere
until you talk to me.

08:27.267 --> 08:28.598
Excuse me one...

08:28.701 --> 08:30.066
Thank you.
What? Fast.

08:30.169 --> 08:31.158
All right, you were right.

08:31.271 --> 08:32.238
I'm a dick. I'm a dick!

08:32.337 --> 08:33.861
You're dickish.
Yes, I'm dickish.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.601
I'm a dickish dick, and I'm
in a rut. We're in a rut.

08:35.708 --> 08:37.404
Let's shake things up.
I have an idea.

08:37.510 --> 08:38.842
Let's get married.
I don't have a ring.

08:38.946 --> 08:39.970
Are you serious?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.570
<i>Mazel tov!
No.</i>

08:41.682 --> 08:43.308
Never mind.
What?

08:43.417 --> 08:44.442
No.
Why?

08:44.552 --> 08:47.817
Because despite this very well
thought out and romantic proposal,

08:47.923 --> 08:50.153
I'm not that interested in
becoming Mrs. Dick-in-a-rut.

08:50.258 --> 08:51.657
Heard that.
Really?

08:51.760 --> 08:53.091
Did you hear that?
Danny?

08:53.194 --> 08:55.220
Maybe you heard that because
you're 2 feet away from us.

08:55.331 --> 08:56.821
That's another one I hate.
"Heard that!"

08:56.933 --> 08:58.594
You don't get married
to get out of a rut.

08:58.701 --> 08:59.861
You get married
because you love someone

08:59.969 --> 09:01.436
and you don't want to spend
your life without them.

09:01.537 --> 09:04.029
Who is this guy? Thank you, Mr. Garvin.
- He's a thief.

09:04.141 --> 09:05.335
Falsely accused.

09:05.442 --> 09:06.602
Oh, well.
He looks like Phil Collins.

09:06.710 --> 09:07.802
Yeah. I know.

09:07.911 --> 09:09.105
Look, life is hard,
all right?

09:09.212 --> 09:10.679
We've lived together for
seven years... You know what?

09:10.781 --> 09:13.876
Danny, life is hard, and you've
become the hardest part of my life.

09:13.985 --> 09:15.077
I should really go.

09:15.186 --> 09:16.517
No, you sit down.

09:18.756 --> 09:19.814
You know, Danny?

09:19.924 --> 09:20.913
We do need to
shake things up.

09:21.025 --> 09:22.185
I know!
That's what I'm saying!

09:22.293 --> 09:23.783
I'm moving out.

09:24.997 --> 09:27.465
Wait a minute.
Are you breaking up with me?

09:28.567 --> 09:30.057
Yeah.

09:30.169 --> 09:31.136
Really?

09:34.140 --> 09:35.334
Wow.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.110
Today sucks.

09:41.448 --> 09:44.509
Look, Danny, whenever a
door closes, another opens, okay?

09:44.618 --> 09:45.607
You just have
to look for it.

09:45.720 --> 09:46.914
And, seriously,
you're gonna get

09:47.021 --> 09:48.989
the most insane
sympathy-rebound pussy.

09:49.190 --> 09:51.556
And this is a good
month for that, too.

09:51.659 --> 09:52.887
I don't want that.

09:52.994 --> 09:54.826
Look, just keep
it together, bro.

09:54.930 --> 09:56.591
Okay? We got one
more school.

09:56.698 --> 09:58.666
We go out, we'll have a few
brewskis, we'll talk this over.

09:58.767 --> 10:01.031
Just put your
game face on.

10:03.873 --> 10:06.671
Taste the beast!
Stay off drugs!

10:06.776 --> 10:08.073
Minotaur!

10:10.546 --> 10:13.572
<i>Drugs. Why do
kids take drugs?</i>

10:14.184 --> 10:15.674
<i>'Cause they're awesome?</i>

10:17.287 --> 10:19.152
<i>No? Maybe they just
understand that life is pain,</i>

10:19.256 --> 10:22.453
<i>and if you smoke something or take
a pill, it'll go away for a while.</i>

10:22.559 --> 10:24.585
<i>I'll drink to that.</i>

10:24.696 --> 10:26.163
Dude, dude, dude,
dude. Come on.

10:26.331 --> 10:27.798
<i>No, no, no.</i>

10:27.899 --> 10:30.629
<i> People say,
"Embrace life. Enjoy life.</i>

10:31.836 --> 10:34.203
<i>" Just do it!
Live it! Rock it!"</i>

10:34.974 --> 10:37.408
<i>Fuck it,
because life is horrible.</i>

10:37.510 --> 10:40.843
<i>You know, I may not be so
happy-go-lucky, but I'm a realist.</i>

10:40.946 --> 10:42.777
<i>Get ready to have
your dreams dashed, kids,</i>

10:42.882 --> 10:44.009
<i>'cause nothing's
gonna work out</i>

10:44.117 --> 10:46.176
<i>the way you
think it's going to.</i>

10:47.287 --> 10:50.313
<i>Chin-chin. By the way,
this stuff's poison.</i>

10:54.195 --> 10:56.425
Game face, bro.
Game face.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.362
What part of "game face"
do you not understand?

10:58.466 --> 10:59.433
What the...

10:59.534 --> 11:00.466
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

11:00.568 --> 11:01.899
Dude, I thought we
could park here.

11:02.003 --> 11:03.300
And you thought wrong,
you furry faggot.

11:03.404 --> 11:05.032
Please, just flip
the switch and put it down.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.732
It's too late.
It's already up.

11:06.842 --> 11:07.809
Come on, please.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.104
Put yourself in my shoes,
would you?

11:09.211 --> 11:10.701
Not my problem.

11:11.346 --> 11:13.007
Dude, please,
could you just be decent?

11:13.115 --> 11:14.378
I'm having a terrible day.

11:14.484 --> 11:18.443
Well, since you put it that
way, it's still not my problem.

11:20.123 --> 11:21.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:21.658 --> 11:22.989
Hey, man, can I ask
you a question?

11:23.093 --> 11:25.221
Get the fuck out
of the way, asshole!

11:25.329 --> 11:26.421
You want me to move?

11:26.530 --> 11:27.690
Game face, buddy.

11:30.134 --> 11:31.328
Danny?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.297
What's he doing?

11:34.406 --> 11:35.873
He's running.
We're running.

11:35.974 --> 11:37.305
We're running!

11:37.409 --> 11:38.671
No, no.

11:38.777 --> 11:41.871
Hey, what are you...
What are you... Get...

11:43.081 --> 11:44.947
I'm the guy that can't enjoy life?
Wrong!

11:45.051 --> 11:46.609
I'm gonna enjoy this!
Right!

11:46.719 --> 11:48.152
Wait, what?

11:51.390 --> 11:52.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:52.492 --> 11:54.188
Hey, man,
what you doing?

11:54.795 --> 11:55.784
Whoa, whoa! Danny!

11:55.929 --> 11:56.896
Hey, man!

11:57.397 --> 11:59.126
Holy shit, man!

12:03.404 --> 12:04.530
Dude!

12:10.778 --> 12:12.871
<i>Taste the beast!</i>

12:15.718 --> 12:17.015
Stay off drugs.

12:17.586 --> 12:18.917
You guys are fucked.

12:19.021 --> 12:20.511
I told you, you asshole!

12:21.457 --> 12:23.084
Beth?
Yes, Wheeler?

12:23.193 --> 12:27.129
I just want to start by saying
I think you're amazing, okay?

12:27.230 --> 12:29.721
You're, like, beauty
and brains incarnate.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.358
So, FYI, there
you go. Okay?

12:32.469 --> 12:36.964
Now, that's that, so as far as this
goes, I didn't do anything here,

12:37.074 --> 12:38.837
so if you wouldn't mind,
you can clear my name,

12:38.943 --> 12:39.967
and I can just walk
right out of here.

12:40.077 --> 12:43.536
Really? Because according to
this, you were a party to...

12:43.649 --> 12:45.514
A party to,
not the party.

12:45.617 --> 12:48.745
...reckless endangerment,
destruction of school property,

12:48.854 --> 12:51.482
obstructing a police officer,
attempted grand theft auto,

12:51.590 --> 12:53.786
disturbing the peace,
parking in a no-parking zone.

12:53.893 --> 12:54.951
Did I ever tell
you you're a dick?

12:55.061 --> 12:56.050
Yeah. Earlier.

12:56.162 --> 12:58.221
And, Danny, they suspended your license.
Did you know that?

12:58.331 --> 13:00.026
Yeah. I figured they
would probably do that.

13:00.133 --> 13:02.499
I mean, did you guys
think this was funny?

13:03.137 --> 13:04.968
You know, if you think about it,
this is kind of your fault.

13:05.072 --> 13:06.164
My... How is
this my fault?

13:06.273 --> 13:07.797
It's your fault because
you just threw it all away,

13:07.908 --> 13:09.307
and I came in here,
I proposed to you...

13:09.410 --> 13:10.877
Your proposal
was bullshit!

13:10.978 --> 13:12.240
But it was real.
It was from the heart!

13:12.346 --> 13:14.042
Shut up! Okay? Shut up!

13:14.649 --> 13:15.809
What's gonna happen?

13:15.917 --> 13:17.782
They wanted to
give you 30 days in jail.

13:17.886 --> 13:19.012
What?

13:19.120 --> 13:20.917
But I worked my
magic on the judge,

13:21.022 --> 13:22.546
and instead,
over the next 30 days,

13:22.657 --> 13:24.922
you have to log 150 hours
of community service.

13:25.027 --> 13:27.325
Community service?
What, we got to clean toilets?

13:27.430 --> 13:28.727
No, you're going
to Sturdy Wings.

13:28.831 --> 13:30.264
It's the judge's
favorite organization.

13:31.534 --> 13:32.626
Yes, Wheeler?

13:32.735 --> 13:34.601
What the fuck
is Sturdy Wings?

13:34.805 --> 13:37.463
<i>Sturdy Wings is
a simple concept.</i>

13:37.574 --> 13:40.304
<i>We bring adults and children
together in a structured format</i>

13:42.026 --> 13:43.153
<i>to enhance the lives
of these children</i>

13:43.262 --> 13:44.593
<i>through
one-on-one friendships.</i>

13:44.697 --> 13:46.756
People ask me,
"Gayle, how did you

13:46.865 --> 13:49.925
"come up with such
a life-altering program?"

13:50.035 --> 13:53.164
And I tell them I spent a
lot of time alone as a kid.

13:53.273 --> 13:55.798
My father was
a traveling salesman.

13:55.909 --> 13:58.639
My mother, out of
necessity, was a whore.

13:58.745 --> 14:01.543
<i>During adolescence,
I hungered for guidance</i>

14:01.648 --> 14:04.345
<i>from a committed,
caring adult.</i>

14:04.485 --> 14:07.613
<i>In my 20s and 30s, I suffered
through an endless cycle</i>

14:07.722 --> 14:11.886
<i>of failed relationships and
constant feelings of inadequacy.</i>

14:13.061 --> 14:16.588
<i>A mere 12 years ago,
I was a raging alcoholic.</i>

14:17.566 --> 14:21.002
<i>To make matters worse, I had
a massive drug addiction,</i>

14:21.103 --> 14:24.540
no money, no job,
no hope.

14:25.374 --> 14:28.275
<i>But at that moment,
I knew what I had to do.</i>

14:28.745 --> 14:30.542
Used to be
addicted to pills.

14:30.646 --> 14:33.514
Now I'm addicted
to helping.

14:34.051 --> 14:35.848
And when you're
addicted to helping,

14:36.019 --> 14:37.486
you don't need
an intervention.

14:39.123 --> 14:41.523
Because sometimes in life,
everybody needs...

14:41.625 --> 14:43.150
Sturdy Wings!
- Sturdy Wings!

14:43.895 --> 14:45.988
<i>A little lovin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

14:47.749 --> 14:51.207
<i>We need a little love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

14:51.752 --> 14:54.278
<i>A little lovin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

14:55.624 --> 14:56.613
See, that's me?

15:02.565 --> 15:04.157
Okay, then.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.167
Welcome, everybody.

15:06.269 --> 15:10.729
You know, it's particularly exciting
for me to have a new batch of Bigs

15:10.840 --> 15:13.571
to match up with a new
group of kids, or Littles,

15:13.677 --> 15:15.577
as we call them
here at Sturdy Wings.

15:15.679 --> 15:17.146
I see a familiar face.

15:17.314 --> 15:18.645
Guilty as charged.

15:20.684 --> 15:22.015
I'd already prefer jail.

15:22.119 --> 15:24.486
All right. Let's move
right along here.

15:24.589 --> 15:26.113
Schedule-wise,
you can elect to spend

15:26.291 --> 15:27.815
as much time
with your Little...

15:27.926 --> 15:29.587
Hey.
- Or as little time.

15:29.694 --> 15:30.718
It takes a village.

15:30.828 --> 15:31.817
Hmm?

15:31.930 --> 15:34.729
Hillary Clinton.
I'm sort of into politics.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.425
I'm sort of engaged.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.093
I sort of have a boner.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.864
Okay.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.270
Got lots of handouts,
information to cover,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.138
so let's get started.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.643
First time with
the program?

15:45.812 --> 15:47.211
Oh, God, really?

15:47.314 --> 15:48.804
Wheeler, switch with me.
No way, dude.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.975
Martin Gary.
I can always spot a newbie.

15:52.853 --> 15:54.184
It's my fifth
year with Wings.

15:54.288 --> 15:56.415
I guess Paul McCartney's
got nothing on me, huh?

15:56.624 --> 15:58.091
<i>Love, take me down
to the streets</i>

16:00.743 --> 16:01.801
That's not a Wings' song.

16:01.911 --> 16:03.641
Yeah, that's one of
their hits from the '70s.

16:03.747 --> 16:05.078
I'm not sure which one.
It's not a... It's not.

16:06.650 --> 16:07.708
It isn't?
- No.

16:07.818 --> 16:09.513
I think it might be.
- No, it's not. Nobody sings that song.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.951
I don't know about that.
I'll have to google it.

16:11.055 --> 16:14.719
That's right, some kids are
allergic to their own sweat.

16:14.826 --> 16:17.522
So probably best to put the
kibosh on physical activity.

16:17.629 --> 16:21.588
Maybe play a boardgame
or tell a knock, knock joke.

16:21.700 --> 16:22.690
Oh!

16:22.802 --> 16:23.769
Martin!

16:23.869 --> 16:25.564
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

16:25.671 --> 16:27.070
Mike Snifferpipits.

16:27.173 --> 16:28.731
Mike Snifferpipits who?

16:28.841 --> 16:31.639
Mike Snifferpipits who?
How many Mike Snifferpipits do you know?

16:31.744 --> 16:33.906
Come on! Let me in.
It's cold out here!

16:34.247 --> 16:35.612
Jeez.

16:36.516 --> 16:37.744
Martin, come on up here.

16:37.851 --> 16:38.875
<i>Let's do
a little dimostrazione.</i>

16:40.738 --> 16:41.227
This...

16:41.338 --> 16:42.306
Ah!

16:42.406 --> 16:44.636
Perfectly acceptable hug
between a Little and a Big.

16:44.742 --> 16:45.936
Ooh, la la!

16:47.311 --> 16:49.472
This is not.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.379
Well, obviously we're not
supposed to butt-fuck these kids.

16:52.484 --> 16:54.008
Well, it looks like
I'm out of handouts.

16:54.119 --> 16:56.178
So why don't we take a little
break, get a cup of joe?

16:56.288 --> 16:58.222
I know I'm gonna put
mine right in here.

16:58.323 --> 17:02.158
And then when you come back, it'll
be time to meet... Drum roll, please.

17:02.262 --> 17:04.958
...your Little!

17:14.040 --> 17:15.406
I cannot wait
to meet mine.

17:15.608 --> 17:17.201
I'm going to take
them to the zoo,

17:17.310 --> 17:20.178
because I
heard that the giant panda bear

17:20.281 --> 17:22.842
has a little
baby panda bear,

17:22.951 --> 17:24.349
and there's
just nothing cuter

17:24.519 --> 17:25.917
than a little
baby panda bear...

17:26.021 --> 17:27.079
Yeah, I can't do this.

17:27.188 --> 17:28.655
Danny, stop.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.419
We will get raped in jail.
Do you understand?

17:31.526 --> 17:33.017
What's the point?

17:33.296 --> 17:35.594
I mean, I've got
nothing to give a kid.

17:35.698 --> 17:37.359
If you were a kid, would
you want to hang out with me?

17:37.466 --> 17:38.660
Hey, do you want
to get raped?

17:38.768 --> 17:39.928
Hello, gentlemen.

17:40.036 --> 17:41.333
Hey.

17:41.437 --> 17:43.497
You probably heard that out of context.
- Excuse me?

17:43.607 --> 17:46.872
When I asked my friend Danny
if he wanted to get raped.

17:46.977 --> 17:50.413
I want you both to listen
to me, okay? And listen good.

17:51.415 --> 17:55.147
I know why you're here,
so don't BS a BSer.

17:55.253 --> 17:59.417
Okay? Your "presence"
here, court-ordered.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.283
Why did you put
"presence" in quotes?

18:02.394 --> 18:03.725
Are you implying
that we're not here?

18:03.829 --> 18:06.821
You know, one call
to the judge from me,

18:06.932 --> 18:09.366
and you are in the slammer,
like M.C. Hammer.

18:09.468 --> 18:10.696
Did M.C. Hammer
go to prison?

18:10.803 --> 18:12.169
Yes, he did.

18:12.272 --> 18:14.103
Or he came
extremely close.

18:14.207 --> 18:17.506
I'm certain he filed for bankruptcy,
so don't BS me right now, okay?

18:17.611 --> 18:19.272
I don't understand.
How are we BSing you?

18:19.379 --> 18:22.315
Exactly. I'm BS-proof.

18:22.416 --> 18:25.044
Here's a couple
of time sheets.

18:25.152 --> 18:28.485
You'll want your little buddies' parents
to sign them after each outing, okay?

18:28.589 --> 18:32.890
And that way, I can use my BS
flyswatter to swat away the flies

18:33.829 --> 18:35.592
that is your BS.

18:36.431 --> 18:38.296
Okay? Any questions?

18:38.967 --> 18:42.233
Hey, little Littles,
your Bigs are here!

18:48.378 --> 18:50.278
Okay. That's good fun!

18:51.414 --> 18:53.940
Danny, your Little is elsewhere.
Why don't you come with me?

18:54.051 --> 18:56.212
Oh, man.

18:56.820 --> 19:00.051
I've heard of popcorn in the
face, but this is ridiculous.

19:07.932 --> 19:10.093
Brothers in arms,
follow me!

19:12.471 --> 19:15.167
The evil King Argotron
has us cornered.

19:15.641 --> 19:19.077
My fair lady Esplen,
Goddess of Navalore.

19:19.178 --> 19:21.112
I fight for your honor.

19:22.149 --> 19:24.117
You wish to kiss me?

19:24.217 --> 19:26.617
There's precious
little time.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.381
What the hell.

19:35.029 --> 19:38.521
No! No. More later!
Now I must fight!

19:41.102 --> 19:45.335
Your kid's name is Augie Farks,
a little older than most of the kids.

19:50.579 --> 19:51.547
Oh.

19:53.383 --> 19:54.350
Um, that...

19:54.651 --> 19:55.948
I wasn't really 100% yet.

19:56.052 --> 19:58.020
Don't judge me
by that move that...

19:58.121 --> 19:59.281
I'm not gonna get
in trouble, right?

19:59.389 --> 20:02.621
This is just... This is just soft foam
and duct tape. It can't harm anyone.

20:02.727 --> 20:03.694
No worries, my liege.

20:03.794 --> 20:04.886
Okay!

20:04.995 --> 20:07.190
This is Danny.
He wants to be your new friend.

20:07.298 --> 20:08.788
So I'm gonna let you guys
get to know each other,

20:08.899 --> 20:11.026
and I'll fade into the mist.

20:13.605 --> 20:15.129
How's it going?

20:17.309 --> 20:19.209
That's a nice routine
you worked out.

20:19.311 --> 20:22.179
I hope you weren't
planning on slaying me.

20:26.586 --> 20:27.780
Wonderful.

20:27.887 --> 20:30.378
Come on, Wheeler. Let's meet
your kid. His name's Ronnie.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.016
He's one of our youngest.
Single mom, full-time job.

20:33.127 --> 20:36.153
Signed him up about six weeks ago.
Matched him up with eight different Bigs.

20:36.263 --> 20:37.491
No one's lasted
more than a day,

20:37.598 --> 20:40.692
but I think you're perfect
because you're young, you're fun,

20:40.801 --> 20:41.894
and you don't
wanna go to prison.

20:42.003 --> 20:43.470
That's scary!

20:43.872 --> 20:44.839
Oh!

20:45.473 --> 20:48.909
And FYI, you're playing on
this girl's court now, okay?

20:49.010 --> 20:50.773
So you're playing by her rules.
Are you the coach?

20:50.879 --> 20:52.939
I am the coach.
I'm the coach, and I'm the point guard,

20:53.048 --> 20:56.711
I'm the two forwards, the
center, and I'm the other guard.

20:56.819 --> 20:59.049
I'm the entire
organization.

21:02.592 --> 21:05.356
Hey, there, Ronnie. How you doing
today? Doing a little drawing?

21:05.462 --> 21:06.929
That's cool.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.759
I want you to meet
someone really special.

21:08.865 --> 21:12.199
And I think you two dudes
are gonna become real homeys.

21:12.303 --> 21:13.565
Ronnie, this is Anson.

21:13.671 --> 21:15.104
Wheeler's good.

21:15.206 --> 21:16.468
Whatever.

21:19.277 --> 21:21.542
Hey, big guy.
What you doing here?

21:21.647 --> 21:24.582
What up, Ronnie?
It's good to meet you.

21:29.988 --> 21:31.479
What you
drawing there?

21:31.591 --> 21:34.389
Oh. Beyoncé.
She's smoking!

21:34.494 --> 21:35.961
I don't want to
take my pants off!

21:36.062 --> 21:37.825
What? Whoa, whoa!

21:38.231 --> 21:39.994
All right, Ronnie.
That's enough.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.328
This bitch tried
to grab my joint!

21:41.435 --> 21:42.697
Language, Ronnie!

21:42.803 --> 21:44.327
My language is English!

21:44.438 --> 21:47.703
And this motherfucker tried
to grab on my hang-down.

21:47.808 --> 21:49.799
I got my own hang-down
to touch, kid.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.606
Honky-ass wanted
a handful of my balls!

21:51.713 --> 21:53.237
Honky? That's racist.

21:53.348 --> 21:56.215
Well, I trust you two will work
this out. I'm not gonna micromanage.

21:56.318 --> 21:58.343
Not my modus operandi.

22:00.522 --> 22:02.184
I have no idea what I'm
gonna do with this kid.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.920
Me, either. I bet if I suggested a game
of Quidditch, he'd come in his pants.

22:06.028 --> 22:08.258
I've been talking to him for half
an hour. Kid's barely said a word.

22:08.364 --> 22:10.093
Maybe we should just
go to jail. It's 30 days.

22:10.199 --> 22:11.189
Whoa!

22:11.301 --> 22:13.701
I don't know if this is some
kind of joke to you, Danny,

22:13.804 --> 22:15.795
but I actually
like my life, okay?

22:15.906 --> 22:18.500
Now, if I go to jail,
I'm gonna lose my job. Listen.

22:18.609 --> 22:20.736
We go to prison, you're
never gonna get Beth back.

22:20.845 --> 22:23.973
We come home after 30 days, she's
banging her boss. I guarantee it.

22:24.082 --> 22:26.642
Really? She's gonna be
banging Patricia Feingold?

22:26.751 --> 22:27.740
Her boss is a chick?

22:27.852 --> 22:29.080
Oh, Jesus.

22:29.187 --> 22:32.214
Danny, just listen, okay?
We're a team. All right? You and me.

22:32.324 --> 22:35.088
We can do this.
We just got to stick together.

22:35.194 --> 22:36.786
Fine.
Good.

22:36.896 --> 22:39.456
So, what do you
do with kids?

22:39.598 --> 22:44.559
<i>Hey, kids! We Chip Monks just broke our
vow of silence, and we want to sing!</i>

22:44.938 --> 22:47.600
<i>We are the monks
of chip monk Charlie's</i>

22:47.707 --> 22:49.971
<i>We will give you food to eat</i>

22:50.210 --> 22:52.577
<i>And once it's in our tummies</i>

22:52.680 --> 22:55.672
<i>We will move
our chip monk feet</i>

22:57.785 --> 23:00.049
<i>We are the butts
of Chip Monk ass</i>

23:00.154 --> 23:01.213
<i>But we've got the ass...</i>

23:01.323 --> 23:02.347
Come on! Sit down!

23:02.457 --> 23:04.823
All right?
Please. Danny.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.417
I like Ronnie's
version better.

23:06.528 --> 23:09.861
I like how it evokes
the concept of ass and butt.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.164
Okay. Thanks.

23:12.268 --> 23:14.133
Don't throw shit,
Ronnie. Come on.

23:14.237 --> 23:16.637
How many hours
do we have left?

23:17.607 --> 23:19.700
So, do you
like Coca-Cola?

23:19.809 --> 23:22.677
I like the idea of it
more than I actually like it.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.043
Ooh! They got
chicken fingers.

23:25.149 --> 23:27.379
I'm gonna run
a train on these chicken fingers.

23:27.484 --> 23:28.610
I'm just gonna be like...

23:30.487 --> 23:33.855
Let me guess. You're not really rolling
with the ladies in school, are you, Augie?

23:33.959 --> 23:38.259
Oh, no. I'm really good friends with
the school nurse. She's a divorcée.

23:38.363 --> 23:42.630
So, Aug, it's a pretty
interesting cape.

23:42.735 --> 23:44.669
Are you like a
superhero or something?

23:44.770 --> 23:46.362
Yeah, I wish.

23:46.472 --> 23:49.202
No, this is... This is part
of my battle attire for Laire.

23:49.308 --> 23:50.366
What the hell is Laire?

23:50.477 --> 23:52.911
It's this fantasy world
where anything is possible.

23:53.013 --> 23:54.947
One minute you could be
sparring with an elf,

23:55.048 --> 23:58.313
and the next you could be battling
against a troll who wants nothing more

23:58.418 --> 24:01.445
than just to steal your gold
and leave you penniless!

24:01.556 --> 24:02.648
Sounds gay.

24:02.757 --> 24:04.019
No, no.
There's girls there.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.092
Girls can be gay.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.627
If by gay you mean
the old English definition

24:07.729 --> 24:11.962
of "fun, enjoyable and carefree,"
then, yes, it's extremely gay.

24:12.067 --> 24:13.932
I think they meant
the other definition.

24:14.036 --> 24:17.130
I know, but to understand it, you
really have to see it for yourself.

24:17.239 --> 24:18.331
Okay.

24:20.075 --> 24:21.566
Hey, pick us up
in two hours.

24:21.678 --> 24:23.646
Fuck you, Miss Daisy!

24:29.419 --> 24:30.944
So, Augie, why do
they call it Laire?

24:31.055 --> 24:33.489
It's Live Action
Interactive Role-playing Explorers.

24:33.591 --> 24:34.819
We're all divided
into countries,

24:34.925 --> 24:37.416
fighting a never-ending war
to control the realm.

24:37.528 --> 24:41.090
Or until they have to
clear you out for soccer practice.

24:41.800 --> 24:42.767
Oh!

24:42.901 --> 24:44.732
Greetings, nobleman!

24:46.038 --> 24:49.371
Any friend of Blufgan's
is a friend of Kuzzik,

24:49.474 --> 24:52.740
fifth son of Leponius,
earl of Ringor.

24:52.845 --> 24:55.507
Diana has put
her bosom away.

24:55.615 --> 24:58.914
Apollo has lifted his skirt.
The day has been launched.

24:59.018 --> 25:02.819
May I present to you
my vassal, Artonius?

25:02.923 --> 25:03.890
Greetings, friends.

25:03.991 --> 25:05.117
Greetings.

25:05.225 --> 25:10.289
Tell me, Blufgan, art thou
preparing for the Battle Royale?

25:10.899 --> 25:12.264
'Tis a mere month away.

25:12.367 --> 25:13.561
Aye, my lord.

25:13.668 --> 25:15.101
Huzzah, huzzah!

25:15.203 --> 25:18.604
Godspeed, Blufgan,
and all hail Xanthia!

25:18.706 --> 25:20.231
Hail, Xanthia!
Hail, Xanthia!

25:20.910 --> 25:22.775
Rub-a-dub-dub!

25:25.815 --> 25:27.214
What the fuck just
happened there?

25:27.316 --> 25:28.476
They're my kinsmen.

25:28.584 --> 25:29.881
We're all from Xanthia.

25:29.985 --> 25:32.784
We're a smaller country,
but we're no Cacedonia, Danny.

25:32.889 --> 25:34.880
Ow! Don't hit so hard!
Okay.

25:36.226 --> 25:37.250
Hi, Blufgan.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.520
Hey! Hey, Esplen.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.132
Blufgan! Blufgan!
Blufgan!

25:42.233 --> 25:43.860
Blufgan!

25:46.037 --> 25:48.562
All right, Gleebo.
One more.

25:52.511 --> 25:54.411
I should have never started
feeding the goddamn elves.

25:54.513 --> 25:55.741
Jesus Christ.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.076
Hey, master handler.

26:01.154 --> 26:02.678
Whoa! Who's that dork?

26:02.789 --> 26:04.188
That's the king.

26:04.657 --> 26:08.423
Well, I should have guessed. Nothing
says royalty like The Burger Hole.

26:08.528 --> 26:11.020
Yeah, he and his lackeys
eat there before every battle.

26:11.132 --> 26:13.225
His majesty approaches.
Oh, crap!

26:13.334 --> 26:14.699
His royalty approaches!

26:14.802 --> 26:16.326
Long live the king.

26:16.704 --> 26:17.830
What are you doing?

26:17.938 --> 26:19.667
You have to kneel
before the king.

26:19.773 --> 26:23.210
Bow down, little girl.
Little girl, bow down, bow down.

26:23.311 --> 26:24.403
Why?

26:24.513 --> 26:25.980
Because he's the king.
I beg you!

26:30.953 --> 26:32.477
No.

26:32.588 --> 26:33.816
Damn it.

26:37.860 --> 26:40.659
Hey, pull over to the mini-mart
and get me some OJ,

26:40.764 --> 26:42.732
and not that
from-concentrate shit.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.130
Would it kill you
to say please?

26:44.234 --> 26:45.792
It might.

26:45.936 --> 26:49.565
"Concentrate. Not from
concentrate. Pulp. Low pulp.

26:49.673 --> 26:51.198
"Lots of pulp."

26:51.309 --> 26:52.503
Well, well, well.

26:52.610 --> 26:56.205
Hey. Fancy meeting you here.
What, are you stalking me?

26:57.448 --> 27:00.009
Had to get my bagel-dog fix.
So how's little Ronnie?

27:00.119 --> 27:03.179
Oh, you were right about us
being a great match. Yeah.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.486
You know, like at Christmas when you
get a gift? That's what Ronnie is.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.992
A gift. I love him so much.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.390
Wow. Well,
that's very nice.

27:13.133 --> 27:16.466
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gots to get my Slurpee on.

27:16.570 --> 27:18.868
Well, watch this though first.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.536
Look at that.
What does that look like?

27:24.845 --> 27:25.937
Okay.

27:32.721 --> 27:33.745
Open the door, Ronnie.

27:33.855 --> 27:35.914
You forgot to say "please."

27:36.892 --> 27:40.488
Please open the door,
or I'll pour your juice out.

27:41.064 --> 27:43.498
I don't drink
juice, biatch!

27:43.600 --> 27:45.431
Come on. Hey. Ronnie.

27:49.673 --> 27:52.699
Oh, no. Don't turn that
engine on. I swear to God...

27:55.579 --> 27:58.139
Okay. Okay.
Joke's over, buddy.

27:58.249 --> 27:59.877
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

27:59.985 --> 28:00.952
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:02.120 --> 28:05.385
Good one! Good one, Ronnie!
Now open the fucking door!

28:05.490 --> 28:07.355
Ronnie! What are you doing?

28:07.459 --> 28:08.790
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude!

28:09.962 --> 28:11.429
What are you doing?

28:14.700 --> 28:16.361
Baby! Yeah!

28:18.437 --> 28:20.303
Don't you run me over!

28:20.407 --> 28:21.635
Oh, no!

28:23.210 --> 28:24.302
Ouch! Watch it!

28:25.512 --> 28:26.877
Hey!

28:26.980 --> 28:29.848
Oh, yeah. So good.
Good times.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.555
You're on
thin ice, buddy.

28:35.657 --> 28:36.851
Then quit.

28:36.958 --> 28:38.391
I never quit.

28:38.493 --> 28:40.462
Give me my
damn juice.

28:40.562 --> 28:42.689
Oh, this juice?
Yeah, that juice.

28:48.237 --> 28:49.432
Fucking asshole.

28:49.539 --> 28:50.870
Punk bitch.

28:50.974 --> 28:54.972
The lad had seasoned his mutton
with wine berry and not mead!

28:57.180 --> 29:01.345
Hey, did you see that spell of
unbreakable madness I casted on those orcs?

29:01.452 --> 29:03.215
I don't think so.

29:03.921 --> 29:06.048
The length of a moon,
hence "honeymoon."

29:07.858 --> 29:10.760
Eight hours down,
142 to go.

29:10.862 --> 29:12.591
This sucks ass.

29:12.698 --> 29:15.724
Dude, I just spent the
afternoon in Middle-earth

29:15.834 --> 29:18.268
with glee-glop and the
floopty-doos, all right?

29:18.370 --> 29:19.429
Give me a fucking break.

29:19.539 --> 29:20.870
I got fucking carjacked.

29:20.973 --> 29:22.372
Yeah? Well, I got dumped.

29:22.475 --> 29:23.908
You deserved it!

29:24.911 --> 29:26.435
I hate your face.

29:26.546 --> 29:28.707
I hate your face.

29:36.790 --> 29:38.382
Ronnie! Ronnie!
Take the wheel!

29:38.492 --> 29:39.585
Yeah.
- What are you doing?

29:39.694 --> 29:41.355
That is not safe!
He can't drive!

29:41.463 --> 29:42.487
This is unsafe.

29:42.597 --> 29:43.791
Okay, stop! Stop! Okay!

29:43.898 --> 29:46.492
What the fuck?
I'm driving! What...

29:48.837 --> 29:49.896
Oh, my God!

29:50.005 --> 29:51.267
Nice. Look what
you started.

29:51.374 --> 29:52.807
Happy now?
- I'm gonna kill you!

29:52.908 --> 29:54.535
What did I do?

30:02.953 --> 30:05.148
So I guess I'll pick you
up tomorrow around 9:00?

30:05.255 --> 30:06.779
Uh, could we make it 10:00?

30:06.890 --> 30:09.485
Kid, you wanna spend
some hours together or not?

30:09.594 --> 30:12.654
Dude, if I'm gonna have to chauffeur
your asses around, let's make it 10:00.

30:12.764 --> 30:13.788
Yeah.

30:13.898 --> 30:16.332
Hey, Danny, you wanna
come see my turtle?

30:16.434 --> 30:17.867
I'm fine.

30:22.941 --> 30:25.068
Of course he
has a turtle.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.149
See you tomorrow, Ronnie.

30:32.252 --> 30:33.617
Fuck you, Anson!

30:33.720 --> 30:34.744
Never gets old.

30:34.854 --> 30:36.082
Wait, wait, wait.

30:36.189 --> 30:37.520
You bitch!

30:51.706 --> 30:53.333
Oh, my God.
She's moving out.

30:53.442 --> 30:55.273
Dude, that's harsh.

30:57.412 --> 30:58.504
Shit.

30:59.749 --> 31:00.841
Wow, you weren't
kidding around.

31:00.950 --> 31:02.247
Yeah, I'm sorry.

31:02.351 --> 31:04.285
I wanted to be gone
by the time you got home.

31:04.387 --> 31:07.322
No, it's all right.
This is better, you know.

31:07.423 --> 31:10.621
Now we get to share the
moment with Wheeler and...

31:11.628 --> 31:12.993
Becca and Sarah.

31:13.096 --> 31:14.290
Yeah, and Becca
and Sarah.

31:14.398 --> 31:16.332
Who you've met,
like, 127 times.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.298
I know.
Keys.

31:19.304 --> 31:22.171
Beth, come on.
You don't have to do this.

31:22.841 --> 31:25.105
I left you the Crock-Pot.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.371
I know you like chili.

31:36.155 --> 31:41.184
I know it's really hard for you right
now, but I just want you to know that

31:41.294 --> 31:43.956
when you love something,
you set it free,

31:44.064 --> 31:47.056
and if it's meant
to be, you just...

31:48.602 --> 31:50.867
You take it back,
and it comes...

31:50.972 --> 31:52.803
Yeah, I know where
you're going with it.

31:52.907 --> 31:56.866
Yeah, and if she doesn't come back, I'd
go for that friend of hers in the sweater.

31:56.978 --> 32:01.040
I know she's a few pounds overweight,
but, you know, in my experience,

32:01.149 --> 32:04.277
it's the bigger ones that
do way more stuff.

32:04.386 --> 32:05.444
Good talk, Wheeler.

32:05.554 --> 32:07.181
Pick you up at 10:00.

32:17.834 --> 32:18.824
Hi, Ronnie.

32:18.936 --> 32:20.460
How are you today?
What are you doing here?

32:20.571 --> 32:21.868
I told you I'd pick
you up at 10:00, right?

32:21.972 --> 32:23.234
But I thought
you'd pussy out.

32:23.340 --> 32:27.709
Well, you see? It's wonderful. We're
learning so much about each other.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.178
Hey! You must be Wheeler.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.880
I'm Karen.
Hi, Karen.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.855
Wow, you look way too young
to be Ronnie's mother.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.358
What are you,
the babysitter?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.121
You're funny.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.754
You're gonna need that sense of humor
if you're gonna keep up with my son.

32:45.865 --> 32:48.596
It's about time Sturdy Wings
found someone who could.

32:48.702 --> 32:52.763
Yeah, well, I think that
Ronnie's a great little dude.

32:52.873 --> 32:55.535
"A great little dude"?
You're cute.

32:57.110 --> 32:58.270
You ready, pal?

32:58.379 --> 33:00.108
I ain't your pal, vanilla.

33:00.648 --> 33:02.673
Karen, would you mind
signing my hours sheet?

33:02.784 --> 33:04.342
Sure.
Great.

33:05.720 --> 33:06.880
Well.

33:07.956 --> 33:09.549
All right.
You boys have fun.

33:09.658 --> 33:12.149
His idea of fun is a
fucking pottery class, yo.

33:12.261 --> 33:15.822
Hey. Hey, hey.
Watch your mouth, little man.

33:17.766 --> 33:18.734
I love you.

33:18.835 --> 33:19.961
I love you, too.

33:25.475 --> 33:26.965
I got shotgun!

33:29.480 --> 33:31.539
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:31.649 --> 33:33.617
Stop. Who are you?
What do you want?

33:33.718 --> 33:36.744
I'm Danny from Sturdy Wings.
I'm here for Augie.

33:36.854 --> 33:40.052
Oh. I'm sorry. Augie, right.
He'll be out in a minute.

33:40.158 --> 33:41.557
Let me ask you something,

33:41.660 --> 33:44.288
because you're one of these guys
that's good with kids, right?

33:44.396 --> 33:46.261
Yeah. Totally.

33:46.365 --> 33:48.026
'Cause, the kid, man,
I don't get it.

33:48.133 --> 33:50.125
He's into dragons
and fairies

33:50.236 --> 33:51.669
and, you know, hoboes.

33:51.771 --> 33:52.829
Right.

33:52.939 --> 33:54.873
So, I mean, what am I
supposed to say to him?

33:54.974 --> 33:55.998
Yeah. I don't know. I don't...

33:56.109 --> 33:58.977
Hey, but while I've got you
here in my personal space,

33:59.079 --> 34:01.741
I was wondering if you could maybe
sign off on my hours from yesterday.

34:01.849 --> 34:03.817
Oh, no, I don't...
I'm not the kid's parent.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.977
No, that's... Parental signatures
are mama's department. One second.

34:07.087 --> 34:10.489
Lynette! Augie's little buddy's here.
He needs your signature.

34:10.592 --> 34:13.117
Oh! Hi!
Hi.

34:13.228 --> 34:14.820
I'm Lynette.
I'm Danny.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.260
So good to meet you.
You, too.

34:16.364 --> 34:19.493
I was wondering if you could maybe
sign my hours sheet from yesterday.

34:19.601 --> 34:20.694
Sure!

34:21.270 --> 34:26.139
You know, we are so thrilled that you are
gonna be spending some time with Augie,

34:26.609 --> 34:30.341
because, you know,
just how he is.

34:31.648 --> 34:32.637
How is he?

34:32.748 --> 34:36.775
I'm just glad you're gonna be getting
him out of his own little world a bit.

34:36.887 --> 34:39.755
It's like, "Get out of here!
Leave home!"

34:40.525 --> 34:42.583
Hey, why don't you come over
for dinner on Saturday night,

34:42.694 --> 34:44.422
and we can get to know you
a little bit better?

34:44.529 --> 34:48.489
I don't think so. It's not you.
I hate having dinner with people.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.692
Hey, Augie, ready to...

34:49.802 --> 34:50.791
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.

34:57.576 --> 34:58.737
I think
they're over here.

34:58.845 --> 35:00.813
I'm disappointed.
This isn't gonna hurt anybody.

35:03.116 --> 35:05.175
So, your parents... Wow.

35:05.418 --> 35:07.045
Jim is not my dad.

35:07.654 --> 35:10.681
Okay. Well, that's
probably good.

35:11.892 --> 35:14.918
Hey, hey, Odeon.
Make way for King Argotron!

35:18.400 --> 35:19.526
Dude.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.934
Bow as your daughter does.

35:26.274 --> 35:27.605
Xanthians.

35:28.211 --> 35:29.576
Why bother?

35:30.480 --> 35:32.004
Good one, sir.

35:35.218 --> 35:36.810
Man, why do you
bow for that guy?

35:36.919 --> 35:39.354
Because he's the king, and
he rules the entire realm.

35:39.456 --> 35:41.185
He rules the entire realm?
Yeah.

35:41.291 --> 35:45.591
<i>My bad. Is that when he is or isn't
whacking it to The Sims?</i>

35:46.697 --> 35:49.223
You know, Augie, maybe you should
think about losing the cape.

35:49.334 --> 35:50.995
At least in public.

35:51.102 --> 35:53.662
People tend to avoid
people in capes.

35:53.772 --> 35:56.070
I know that's not
the case here.

35:56.775 --> 35:58.641
Look at these people.

36:04.250 --> 36:05.774
I like these people.
No, I know.

36:05.885 --> 36:09.378
But, you know, this isn't reality.
It's not the real world.

36:09.489 --> 36:12.890
I know that, but in this
world, I don't have to be me.

36:14.094 --> 36:16.085
I'm stuck again!

36:16.196 --> 36:18.563
Well, looks like maybe one of
your people could use a hand.

36:18.666 --> 36:21.533
Help! Help! Help!
Her, I don't like.

36:30.445 --> 36:32.345
Okay. This is my place.

36:32.915 --> 36:34.314
Shit hole.

36:35.584 --> 36:39.282
Look, kid, you're obviously not
a big fan of me, and that's okay,

36:39.389 --> 36:41.084
but I think there's
something to be gained

36:41.191 --> 36:44.285
from us spending 139
more hours together.

36:45.128 --> 36:46.288
Yeah.

36:48.032 --> 36:50.125
You know, my dad left me
when I was young,

36:50.234 --> 36:52.225
so I know it sucks,

36:52.336 --> 36:55.567
but what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

36:55.673 --> 36:58.370
Says the punk living
in the shit hole.

36:59.945 --> 37:01.071
Who are these clowns?

37:01.179 --> 37:02.168
Kiss?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.577
You don't know who Kiss is?

37:03.682 --> 37:05.172
No. Never heard of them.

37:05.283 --> 37:06.477
They look like
idiots to me.

37:06.585 --> 37:07.575
No, no, no, dude.

37:07.687 --> 37:09.712
These are four of the
smartest guys who ever lived.

37:09.822 --> 37:12.052
They're these Jewish guys
that grew up in New York,

37:12.158 --> 37:14.251
and they put on guitars
and makeup to get girls,

37:14.360 --> 37:16.055
and all of their songs
are about fucking!

37:16.162 --> 37:17.790
I'm listening.

37:21.902 --> 37:26.236
<i>Seriously, this song is called Love
Gun, and it's about Paul Stanley's dick</i>

37:26.340 --> 37:28.901
and how this girl's gonna
get some of his dick!

37:29.010 --> 37:30.341
Cool.

37:30.445 --> 37:31.776
I didn't know Jews
could sing like that.

37:31.880 --> 37:36.010
No. No. They couldn't at the time.
That's why they had to dress like clowns.

37:36.117 --> 37:37.380
This got them girls?

37:37.486 --> 37:40.922
Get this! They've been getting
pussy nonstop for 30 years!

37:41.023 --> 37:43.184
They're probably fucking right
now, and they're old dudes!

37:43.292 --> 37:45.021
They put makeup on,
and it's all good!

37:45.127 --> 37:46.253
No shit?

37:46.362 --> 37:50.094
<i>You pull the trigger of my</i>

37:51.234 --> 37:52.462
<i>Love gun</i>

37:52.569 --> 37:54.799
You see, Ronnie?
His dick is the gun!

37:57.775 --> 37:59.675
<i>Love gun</i>

38:00.678 --> 38:02.738
<i>Love gun</i>

38:04.181 --> 38:06.615
Okay, we logged 14
hours this weekend.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.117
That's not gonna
be enough.

38:08.220 --> 38:11.314
Somehow we gotta get them
on the weekdays, too.

38:11.423 --> 38:14.449
Hey, we could pretend to be their
uncles, pull them out of school.

38:14.559 --> 38:15.992
That just sounds
kind of creepy.

38:16.094 --> 38:17.289
Yeah, I guess.

38:17.397 --> 38:20.059
Hey! Sexy like a
chocolate strawberry.

38:23.036 --> 38:24.003
What's her problem?

38:24.103 --> 38:25.195
I don't know.

38:25.305 --> 38:27.068
I mean, you laid that
genius line on her.

38:27.174 --> 38:28.573
I can't believe she
didn't take your bait.

38:28.676 --> 38:29.870
I know, right?

38:30.678 --> 38:32.202
Well, well, well.

38:32.313 --> 38:34.907
If it isn't Mr. Bullshit
and Dr. I'm-full-of-shit.

38:35.015 --> 38:36.141
In what way
are we full of shit?

38:36.250 --> 38:37.718
Which one of us
has the Ph. D?

38:37.819 --> 38:39.912
So how was your first
weekend with the boys?

38:40.021 --> 38:43.718
It was great. We did 14 hours.
Will you sign our sheets?

38:43.825 --> 38:46.453
Maybe give us a few more, just
for kicks? Round it up to 50?

38:46.561 --> 38:48.257
Don't you sass me.

38:48.364 --> 38:51.800
What, do you think I'm a pushover? You
know what I used to eat for breakfast?

38:51.901 --> 38:53.129
Cocaine.

38:53.669 --> 38:56.297
You know what I
used to eat for lunch?

38:56.872 --> 38:57.965
Cocaine.

38:58.075 --> 38:59.599
What'd you have for dinner?
Was it cocaine?

38:59.710 --> 39:04.647
I will sign your sheets, but you need to
know I am not here to service your hours.

39:04.748 --> 39:07.411
I'm here to service
these young boys.

39:07.518 --> 39:11.113
Do you think I give a shit
if you guys go to prison?

39:11.222 --> 39:13.190
I've been to prison. I have.

39:13.291 --> 39:15.122
I've been to prison.

39:15.526 --> 39:20.328
A prison of drugs, alcohol
and sick thoughts.

39:20.632 --> 39:22.793
I used to have sick thoughts.

39:22.901 --> 39:25.062
So don't you come in here,

39:25.170 --> 39:27.935
preaching to me about hours

39:28.708 --> 39:33.168
when you're standing over there,
and you're standing over there,

39:33.279 --> 39:35.247
and I don't know
which way is up!

39:35.348 --> 39:36.679
Um...
Should we come back?

39:36.783 --> 39:37.978
We can come back.
Yeah.

39:38.085 --> 39:39.518
Come here.

39:40.154 --> 39:43.089
We're having an overnight camping trip,
Big Bear this weekend.

39:43.190 --> 39:46.125
I suggest that you ask
your Littles to go with you.

39:46.227 --> 39:49.095
Maybe worry a little bit about them
and not so much about your hours.

39:49.197 --> 39:51.097
Overnight?
That's great. Sign us up.

39:51.199 --> 39:52.757
And, fellas,
will you do me a favor?

39:52.868 --> 39:55.268
Next time you
want to bullshit me,

39:55.871 --> 39:58.466
bullshit each
other instead, okay?

39:59.709 --> 40:01.540
See how that feels.

40:02.278 --> 40:03.973
Okay.
Yep.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.672
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

40:06.382 --> 40:07.714
All right.

40:08.819 --> 40:09.911
I hate camping.

40:10.020 --> 40:11.419
You could use a little
dose of the outdoors.

40:11.522 --> 40:14.821
Camping blows. It's dirty, and
I don't like sleeping on rocks.

40:14.925 --> 40:16.860
Bring some Ambien.
You'll sleep like a baby.

40:16.961 --> 40:20.795
There's always a guy with an acoustic guitar
that doesn't quite know how to play it.

40:21.666 --> 40:23.224
<i>Kumbaya, my...</i>

40:23.334 --> 40:24.323
Wait. I know it.

40:24.436 --> 40:25.403
<i>Kumbaya</i>

40:25.537 --> 40:27.870
You know.
Wait. I know it. Wait.

40:28.107 --> 40:30.735
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

40:32.545 --> 40:35.207
No. Wait.
Oh, yeah, I got it.

40:35.314 --> 40:36.338
This is it.

40:37.384 --> 40:39.409
I think that's got it.

40:41.154 --> 40:42.485
God damn it, Ronnie!

40:42.589 --> 40:44.250
What? 'Cause I'm black,
you think I did it?

40:44.357 --> 40:47.452
No, 'cause you did it
is why I think you did it.

40:48.763 --> 40:51.231
Let me tell you something.
I am not your Big, and I'll hit you.

40:51.332 --> 40:52.299
I will hit a child.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.493
I've never done that before,
but I will punch you in the face.

40:54.602 --> 40:55.864
Let's dance,
Ben Affleck!

40:55.970 --> 40:57.438
Ronnie! Leave him alone.

40:57.539 --> 40:58.528
Fine!

40:58.640 --> 41:00.505
But I'm watching
you, Daredevil.

41:00.609 --> 41:03.544
Looks like you guys
could use a hand up here.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.942
Come on, man!
Just having some fun.

41:07.050 --> 41:08.449
Let's take a hike.
- Thank you.

41:08.551 --> 41:12.419
Don't worry. Once the little ones are
asleep, I'll break out the PG stuff.

41:12.522 --> 41:13.989
<i>Kumbaya, huh?</i>

41:14.090 --> 41:15.318
You don't happen to
know any Wings, do you?

41:15.425 --> 41:16.723
Wings? Yeah.

41:17.128 --> 41:19.096
<i>Love, take me down
to the streets</i>

41:19.196 --> 41:20.561
Yeah!

41:21.332 --> 41:24.392
Man! She got some
boobies on her!

41:24.502 --> 41:26.026
You sure do like
boobies, Ronnie.

41:26.137 --> 41:27.162
I sure do.

41:27.272 --> 41:29.968
Sometimes I call myself
the Booby Watcher.

41:30.075 --> 41:33.408
<i>Even got my own comic book.
Adventures of the Booby Watcher.</i>

41:33.512 --> 41:36.072
Okay. You know,
I got a theory about boobies.

41:36.181 --> 41:37.513
Really?
Yeah.

41:37.617 --> 41:39.585
You see, there are as many women
as there are men on this planet.

41:39.685 --> 41:40.709
True that, true that.

41:40.820 --> 41:44.347
And every woman has two
boobs, for the most part.

41:45.024 --> 41:47.721
So therefore, there's twice
as many boobs as there are men.

41:47.828 --> 41:49.762
We're outnumbered,
and it's overwhelming.

41:49.863 --> 41:52.195
We're powerless.
We have to accept it.

41:52.299 --> 41:54.824
I like your take
on boobies.

41:55.502 --> 41:57.266
And I like boobies.

41:57.372 --> 41:58.896
Kid, you got a lot to learn.

41:59.007 --> 42:00.099
I know what I'm doing.
Really?

42:00.208 --> 42:01.732
So you're aware that you've
committed one of the most

42:01.843 --> 42:02.810
common rookie
boob-watching errors?

42:04.359 --> 42:05.451
What you mean?

42:05.560 --> 42:06.585
Never stare at
the boobies, kid.

42:06.696 --> 42:09.324
Yeah, once you get caught,
the game's over.

42:09.599 --> 42:11.362
But how?
It's called training.

42:11.467 --> 42:13.992
You know, being aware
without drawing attention.

42:14.103 --> 42:16.800
You don't think I've noticed the
34-C's in the camouflage tank top

42:16.907 --> 42:18.602
setting up the tent
directly to the left of us?

42:18.709 --> 42:22.110
How about those twin cannons hiking up
the mountain ridge 50 yards due west?

42:22.212 --> 42:23.440
Or the ridge itself?

42:23.547 --> 42:24.878
Round mounds of
grass shaped like...

42:25.716 --> 42:26.684
Boobies!

42:26.785 --> 42:27.774
Don't look over there.
Look here.

42:28.553 --> 42:31.078
Yeah, focus.
You'll get it.

42:31.423 --> 42:34.449
Too bad old Sweeny herself
couldn't come up here for this trip.

42:34.559 --> 42:35.617
That would have
been fun, huh?

42:35.727 --> 42:36.820
Yeah. A real blast.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.523
Yeah, she probably just
had to hold down the fort.

42:40.733 --> 42:42.530
You got a thing
for Sweeny, Martin?

42:42.868 --> 42:46.828
Sweeney? Me? No.
Now that is a knee slapper.

42:47.274 --> 42:48.536
Your erection is showing.

42:48.742 --> 42:49.709
What?

42:52.245 --> 42:53.212
You okay?

42:56.617 --> 42:58.517
Nature.

42:58.820 --> 43:02.347
Did you know that bald eagles are known
to engage in a bizarre mating ritual

43:02.457 --> 43:05.085
where two eagles fly upwards,
lock talons,

43:05.726 --> 43:08.355
then fall towards the earth
while rotating,

43:08.464 --> 43:10.523
separating moments before
they crash into the ground,

43:10.799 --> 43:13.597
if, and only if, they
consummate their bird fuck?

43:14.303 --> 43:18.104
If they don't, they're willing
to accept death by hard ground.

43:18.842 --> 43:20.707
It's the ultimate race
against the clock.

43:20.810 --> 43:22.141
Why are you
telling me this?

43:22.245 --> 43:23.803
Why would I not?

43:32.805 --> 43:34.500
Hi, Danny.

43:34.607 --> 43:36.599
I forgot to tell you,
they'll be telling

43:37.811 --> 43:38.869
ghost stories later.

43:38.979 --> 43:40.003
You should stop by.

43:41.548 --> 43:45.678
And as the barn door
creaked open, ever so slowly,

43:45.786 --> 43:48.756
standing there with
the moon at his back

43:48.856 --> 43:53.623
and holding the severed head of the
pediatrician's mother in his hand,

43:53.728 --> 43:56.527
was Philip,

43:58.167 --> 43:59.156
the pizza delivery boy

43:59.268 --> 44:01.634
from when they ordered pizza
at the beginning of the story!

44:01.737 --> 44:03.602
Come on, you guys!

44:03.706 --> 44:05.037
All right. Whatever!
Hey, come here.

44:05.140 --> 44:06.608
You guys
are unscareable.

44:06.710 --> 44:08.837
Think you can do better?
Who's got a better story? Come on.

44:08.945 --> 44:11.209
You guys are so smart.
Who's got a scarier story than me?

44:11.314 --> 44:13.214
Yes?
So what's up?

44:13.316 --> 44:15.511
I don't know.
What's up with you?

44:15.619 --> 44:17.144
I know you're engaged.
I haven't forgotten.

44:17.254 --> 44:18.221
Uh-huh.

44:18.356 --> 44:19.516
So what's this?

44:19.624 --> 44:20.591
Ooh.

44:20.858 --> 44:21.984
Those are my testicles.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.219
Yeah.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.386
Listen, I have an
arrangement with my fiancé.

44:25.496 --> 44:29.957
I'm completely faithful to him within
the area codes of greater Los Angeles.

44:30.068 --> 44:34.027
Out here, I'm just another
woman who's ready to cheat.

44:34.139 --> 44:35.903
Give me two minutes.

44:36.009 --> 44:38.773
How about you, Daniel?
You think you can top it?

44:38.911 --> 44:40.469
It's Danny.
Oh.

44:40.580 --> 44:45.814
<i>Oh, Danny boy
The Danny boys are Danny boys</i>

44:46.820 --> 44:50.187
Come on, man! We're on pins
and needles. Give us a story.

44:50.290 --> 44:52.383
Okay, I've got a really
good horror story,

44:52.493 --> 44:55.657
and it's particularly
terrifying because it's true.

44:55.764 --> 44:57.698
Oh, a true story!

44:57.799 --> 45:01.667
In countries all over the
world, including our own,

45:01.803 --> 45:04.465
children, many
of them just like you,

45:05.273 --> 45:07.765
are abducted and sold

45:07.877 --> 45:10.641
into the world of
underground sex trafficking.

45:10.946 --> 45:12.004
What is he saying?
Okay!

45:13.349 --> 45:15.716
I'm gonna stop you there,
Danny boy. That is a scary story.

45:15.819 --> 45:18.754
Story time is over! Everybody,
let's break into our groups.

45:18.855 --> 45:22.484
Group A, come with me for
Martin's midnight mystery hike.

45:22.592 --> 45:24.753
And group B, go with Duane.
What you got on tap, Duane?

45:24.861 --> 45:27.558
We are gonna make some
s'mores using white chocolate.

45:27.665 --> 45:28.654
Oh.

45:28.766 --> 45:31.929
Well, I'm not sure I agree with
that, but to each their own.

45:32.036 --> 45:34.129
Hey, hey, Danny.
Is this all your Ambien?

45:34.238 --> 45:35.227
Yeah.

45:35.339 --> 45:37.467
Okay, 'cause Connie
and I are gonna take some,

45:37.576 --> 45:39.305
and then we're gonna stay up
as late as we can,

45:39.411 --> 45:41.072
because if you fight
the urge to go to sleep,

45:41.180 --> 45:43.444
things start to get all trippy,
and then we're gonna fuck.

45:43.549 --> 45:44.607
Connie who's engaged.

45:44.717 --> 45:45.810
Oh, yeah.

45:45.919 --> 45:49.753
You know what? Don't worry about
it. We'll make do with three each.

45:57.498 --> 46:00.058
Fight it. Come on.
Stay awake.

46:00.835 --> 46:03.702
You know, a lot of people don't
realize that bushes, just like flowers,

46:03.804 --> 46:06.035
emit a wonderful aroma,
especially at night.

46:06.141 --> 46:07.733
Who wants to sniff
this bush?

46:14.850 --> 46:17.319
So Ronnie's out on
some kind of hike.

46:17.420 --> 46:18.478
Where's Wheeler?

46:18.588 --> 46:19.816
He's having sex
with a married lady.

46:19.922 --> 46:20.911
Oh.

46:21.023 --> 46:22.854
Are you sewing?
Yeah.

46:23.326 --> 46:25.557
This is my country's
emblem.

46:27.664 --> 46:30.861
Do you think we can speak
in private for a second?

46:32.703 --> 46:34.068
Yeah. Yeah.

46:35.673 --> 46:37.971
I already talked to Kuzzik
and Artonius,

46:38.076 --> 46:43.104
and we would like to officially invite
you to be a soldier in the Xanthian army.

46:43.214 --> 46:46.776
Well, that's very kind of you, but
I would like to respectfully decline.

46:46.886 --> 46:47.978
I'm kind of a pacifist.

46:48.087 --> 46:50.078
I don't really believe
in imaginary bloodshed.

46:50.189 --> 46:53.215
But there's room in Laire
for all belief systems.

46:53.325 --> 46:56.955
Even early barbaric
modalities have their place.

46:58.231 --> 47:00.597
Augie, look, you're
a good kid. I like you,

47:00.700 --> 47:03.168
but I'm not really into
the whole buddy-buddy,

47:03.270 --> 47:05.569
let's-go-do-stuff-together
kind of thing.

47:05.673 --> 47:07.903
Well, why are you here?

47:10.678 --> 47:12.441
It's court-ordered.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.980
What did you do?

47:15.751 --> 47:18.618
I just had one of those days
where you wake up and say,

47:18.720 --> 47:21.712
"Where did the last
10 years of my life go?"

47:21.824 --> 47:25.022
I asked my girlfriend
to marry me out of impulse.

47:25.695 --> 47:27.185
She dumped me.

47:28.031 --> 47:32.365
And then I ran a truck that looks
like a bull into a statue of a horse.

47:33.069 --> 47:34.832
I'm not here by choice
either, by the way.

47:34.938 --> 47:35.997
No?

47:36.106 --> 47:37.801
My guidance counselor
signed me up.

47:37.908 --> 47:39.569
Really?
Yeah.

47:39.677 --> 47:43.204
Said anyone who wears a cape and
has a sword should have more friends.

47:43.314 --> 47:45.078
Whoop-dee-doo, right?

47:45.884 --> 47:47.545
So both of us don't
want to be here.

47:47.652 --> 47:48.914
No.

47:49.020 --> 47:51.147
Well, we got that in common.

47:52.724 --> 47:54.089
So do you have
a girlfriend?

47:54.192 --> 47:55.319
No. What?

47:55.528 --> 47:58.656
Why would you ask...
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

47:58.764 --> 48:01.699
But what about that girl you're always
looking at, with the cap and the...

48:01.801 --> 48:03.701
I don't know what
you're talking about.

48:03.803 --> 48:06.170
Come on!
Don't bullshit me.

48:06.273 --> 48:08.036
You're always
looking at her.

48:08.141 --> 48:10.632
You mean Esplen,
the Goddess of Navalore?

48:10.744 --> 48:11.768
I don't know. Probably.

48:11.879 --> 48:12.903
Her name's Sarah.

48:13.013 --> 48:14.105
Sarah.

48:14.514 --> 48:16.073
Ah, Sarah.

48:17.452 --> 48:18.510
You ever talk to her?

48:18.620 --> 48:19.678
No.

48:19.787 --> 48:22.449
I've killed her a couple of times in
battle, but that's not really anything.

48:22.557 --> 48:23.489
Talk to her.

48:23.591 --> 48:24.854
No, I can't talk to her.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.793
Romance her. Give her that
patch of yours. She'll love it.

48:27.897 --> 48:28.921
No, I can't give her this.

48:29.031 --> 48:30.225
She'll be flattered!
Why not?

48:30.332 --> 48:32.061
I made it for you.

48:34.470 --> 48:35.438
You made that for me?

48:35.538 --> 48:36.596
Yeah.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.532
Great. Now I gotta do it.

48:38.642 --> 48:40.041
Yeah, that kind
of was my plan.

48:40.143 --> 48:41.667
That was so low, dude.

48:46.651 --> 48:49.176
No. Come on, Connie.
Stay awake.

48:52.523 --> 48:53.615
Fuck.

48:55.193 --> 48:56.558
I gotta pee.

48:57.396 --> 48:58.522
Yep.

49:01.133 --> 49:02.760
Hey! Martin!

49:02.868 --> 49:03.857
Okay.

49:03.969 --> 49:05.995
What are you
doing out here?

49:06.105 --> 49:07.629
I'm just doing my
perimeter check.

49:07.740 --> 49:11.141
Hey, did you know that
dinosaurs are not extinct?

49:11.244 --> 49:14.772
Because birds are dinosaurs,
and they're everywhere.

49:14.982 --> 49:17.007
Okay!

49:17.618 --> 49:19.518
Now, all right.

49:20.154 --> 49:22.247
I gotta pee.
I really gotta pee.

49:26.861 --> 49:28.328
Look at that.

49:29.064 --> 49:31.123
Yo, Wheeler!
You in there?

49:35.738 --> 49:37.103
Oh, my God.

49:38.307 --> 49:40.002
Dude.
- Nice, man.

49:40.109 --> 49:41.667
Oh, boy.

49:41.777 --> 49:44.713
This is a classic case
of guy on the ground.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.412
I'm sorry.
I don't care.

49:53.523 --> 49:54.616
Okay.

49:54.859 --> 49:57.794
So I heard there was
some sex on the trip

49:57.895 --> 49:59.624
and some drugs, too.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.891
Only thing missing
was rock 'n' roll.

50:05.904 --> 50:08.065
What was Danny doing
with those Ambiens?

50:08.173 --> 50:10.573
He has trouble sleeping
outdoors.

50:11.443 --> 50:14.777
How did Wheeler come to be
naked in the center of camp?

50:14.881 --> 50:16.178
He was sleepwalking.

50:16.282 --> 50:18.147
Danny ever offer you drugs?
Well...

50:18.251 --> 50:19.946
Answer me.
No, ma'am.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.652
Did Wheeler ever
expose himself to you?

50:22.756 --> 50:24.018
Hell no!

50:26.427 --> 50:29.954
Fellows? These young gentlemen
here have decided your fates.

50:30.064 --> 50:33.898
If it was up to me, I'd lock you both
up, but the boys are saying you're okay.

50:34.001 --> 50:37.165
This is your last chance.
Start acting like Bigs.

50:39.708 --> 50:40.800
Thanks, guys.

50:40.909 --> 50:42.433
<i>Suck it, Reindeer Games!</i>

50:42.544 --> 50:43.704
I'm not Ben Affleck.

50:43.812 --> 50:45.678
You white?
Then you Ben Affleck.

50:45.782 --> 50:47.579
Right, Wheeler?
Yeah. You are white.

50:47.683 --> 50:49.173
That's true,
I am white.

50:49.285 --> 50:50.479
Let's go.

51:05.637 --> 51:06.695
Ready to go?

51:06.805 --> 51:08.432
Yeah. I'm ready. All right.

51:08.540 --> 51:09.666
Excellent!

51:12.343 --> 51:14.539
You are going down!

51:14.647 --> 51:16.842
Don't you mess
with my dark arts.

51:17.850 --> 51:19.078
You shall be slain.

51:19.185 --> 51:21.016
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

51:21.921 --> 51:24.618
Fuck my cock! Sorry.

51:27.494 --> 51:29.519
I have a question, Wheeler.
- Yes, JJ.

51:29.629 --> 51:33.622
How many dates do you have to go out
with a girl before you get to touch her...

51:33.733 --> 51:35.201
Boobs?
Yeah.

51:36.037 --> 51:37.026
Good question.

51:37.138 --> 51:38.105
So you get
hit in the arm,

51:38.206 --> 51:39.764
you lose your arm.
Yes.

51:39.874 --> 51:41.341
You gotta put it behind
you, like this.

51:41.442 --> 51:43.410
You get hit in the leg,
you lose the leg.

51:43.511 --> 51:44.501
See you.

51:44.613 --> 51:45.841
So you gotta hop.

51:45.948 --> 51:47.142
You can't use it.
You gotta hop around?

51:47.249 --> 51:48.443
Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta hop.

51:48.550 --> 51:51.018
And if you get hit in
the chest, then you're...

51:52.588 --> 51:54.489
lifestyle you chose

51:54.591 --> 51:56.582
could lead to dying sad and alone?
- What?

51:56.693 --> 51:58.752
What about STDs? No.
Herpes?

51:58.862 --> 52:01.456
Gonorrhea? At the very least, crabs.
- What the hell?

52:01.564 --> 52:04.659
I don't have crabs. What have
you been telling them, Ronnie?

52:04.768 --> 52:06.258
You got crabs.

52:07.905 --> 52:08.929
Hi.

52:18.583 --> 52:21.484
Come on, whitey, dance! Break
it on down! Get it funky!

52:23.421 --> 52:24.684
He's out.

52:44.379 --> 52:46.006
Thank you.
Yep.

52:47.115 --> 52:48.844
Call her. Sweep
her off her feet.

52:48.950 --> 52:50.076
It's not that easy, Augie.

52:50.185 --> 52:51.709
Just let her know
how you feel.

52:51.819 --> 52:52.786
Give her one call.

52:52.887 --> 52:54.082
All right. I'll...

52:54.190 --> 52:55.782
Just get off my back.

52:55.891 --> 52:57.518
Did you know in
the 14th century that

52:57.626 --> 53:00.459
knights used to write love songs
and poems for the women they loved,

53:00.563 --> 53:01.791
even if she was married?

53:01.897 --> 53:03.228
No, I didn't know that.

53:03.332 --> 53:04.357
Well, there you go.

53:04.467 --> 53:05.764
It's her voice mail.

53:05.869 --> 53:07.734
Hey, Beth. How's it going? It's me.

53:07.837 --> 53:10.032
Tell her her hair is like 1,000 suns.
Look, I...

53:10.140 --> 53:12.233
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to get together.

53:12.342 --> 53:13.708
I know there's a lot
of stuff I'd like to say.

53:13.811 --> 53:15.005
Whispering eye.

53:15.112 --> 53:17.876
So, if you get a chance,
give me a call back and...

53:17.982 --> 53:20.041
You long for her whispering eye.
We can...

53:20.151 --> 53:21.482
We can see each other.

53:21.586 --> 53:22.553
I'd love to see you.

53:22.653 --> 53:23.712
And her whispering eye.

53:23.822 --> 53:25.790
And your whispering eye.

53:26.491 --> 53:28.015
All right. Bye.

53:29.494 --> 53:31.018
Whispering eye?

53:31.496 --> 53:33.293
It means vagina.

53:36.069 --> 53:37.661
It means vagina.

53:38.404 --> 53:39.928
That's a classy
move, man.

53:40.039 --> 53:41.233
It means vagina.

53:41.341 --> 53:44.641
Yeah. Get your whispering
eye in the cab, Augie.

53:45.145 --> 53:46.305
Vagina!

53:51.185 --> 53:52.243
Hey.

53:53.989 --> 53:55.013
Hi.

53:55.790 --> 53:57.018
Thanks for meeting me.

53:57.125 --> 54:00.026
<i>I got you a venti chai,</i>

54:00.495 --> 54:03.590
which is what they call
a large here, which I love.

54:03.699 --> 54:04.757
Wow.

54:05.301 --> 54:07.428
There's a transformation.

54:07.536 --> 54:10.699
Yes, well, you know, I've been doing
this community service for almost a month,

54:10.806 --> 54:14.800
and I really feel as if it's given
me some perspective on things.

54:14.911 --> 54:16.845
Well, that's great.
I hope that's true, Danny.

54:16.947 --> 54:18.710
So let's get married.

54:19.082 --> 54:21.073
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.
Wait.

54:21.184 --> 54:23.517
Danny, you are not taking
this breakup seriously.

54:23.621 --> 54:25.782
Yeah, because
I don't want it.

54:28.259 --> 54:29.692
Do you really think
I wanted this?

54:29.794 --> 54:33.390
Look. Hey. This is us.

54:33.499 --> 54:35.194
This is not us.

54:35.301 --> 54:38.498
We have not been us in a
while, because you are not you.

54:38.604 --> 54:40.333
Danny, you're not happy.

54:40.439 --> 54:43.568
I've been with you seven years, and
it's been getting progressively worse.

54:43.677 --> 54:48.546
And it makes me feel bad about
me that I can't make you happier.

54:48.648 --> 54:52.812
Where am I gonna find a girl who
hates all the same things I do?

54:52.919 --> 54:54.285
You're so romantic.

54:54.388 --> 54:55.787
Hey. Hey.

54:57.291 --> 54:58.918
"You complete me."

55:01.629 --> 55:03.723
"You had me at 'hello."'
Oh, God. Danny.

55:03.832 --> 55:04.856
Come on, Beth.
You're not...

55:04.966 --> 55:06.297
You're not hearing
what I'm saying to you.

55:06.401 --> 55:10.098
"I am just a girl standing in front
of a boy, telling her to love her."

55:10.205 --> 55:11.297
You don't even
know that one.

55:11.406 --> 55:12.600
Hey. Come on.

55:12.708 --> 55:14.404
"Who you gonna call?"

55:15.345 --> 55:16.642
"Ghost Busters."
Okay. You know what?

55:16.746 --> 55:20.876
No. I am committing to this breakup.
This is the best thing for us.

55:24.188 --> 55:26.986
You can call me if you
need legal advice.

55:36.735 --> 55:39.431
Come on! Let's kill
some Cacedonians!

55:39.537 --> 55:42.870
And I got a little
something-something for you to wear.

55:45.177 --> 55:46.439
Yeah, I'm not
gonna wear this.

55:46.545 --> 55:47.671
No?

55:48.381 --> 55:51.714
Soon enough.
Soon enough you'll want it.

55:51.817 --> 55:52.806
Yeah.

55:53.520 --> 55:56.717
Yo, Wheeler. What up, dog? You
scoundrel. What are you doing, man?

55:56.823 --> 55:59.223
Yo, Hogan's having another
party tonight, man. You gotta go.

55:59.326 --> 56:02.193
There's gonna be a lot of
sweet-ass pussy there, girl pussy.

56:02.295 --> 56:04.457
Ooh! Uh...

56:05.666 --> 56:08.100
Thanks for the offer.
Maybe some other time.

56:08.202 --> 56:10.295
You're the king, Wheeler.
You're the king.

56:10.405 --> 56:13.432
Dude, don't give up that
sweet-ass pussy on my account.

56:13.542 --> 56:14.668
I'll go with you.

56:14.777 --> 56:16.142
Okay. If you say so.

56:16.245 --> 56:17.940
All right.
You're my PIC, Wheeler.

56:18.046 --> 56:19.946
What's a PIC?
Partner in crime.

56:20.048 --> 56:22.539
You're my PIC. Just don't
cock-block me tonight.

56:22.651 --> 56:24.415
Wouldn't dream of it.
We'll have a great time.

56:24.521 --> 56:26.250
We'll go to the party,
we'll get some zah,

56:26.356 --> 56:27.323
play some Xbox.

56:27.424 --> 56:28.584
Damn straight.

56:28.691 --> 56:32.855
Countrymen, smell
the battle in the air!

56:32.963 --> 56:35.261
Esplen,
Goddess of Navalore.

56:35.366 --> 56:38.733
Venus herself would be jealous.
Braman, good to see you.

56:38.836 --> 56:40.565
Good morrow, sir!
Good morrow to you.

56:40.671 --> 56:41.729
Good morning.

56:41.839 --> 56:44.900
Keep your blades sharp
but your wits sharper.

56:45.010 --> 56:49.037
Ah! Gleebo, look at you.
A visage.

56:49.147 --> 56:51.342
Men, get ready to
dance with swords!

56:52.551 --> 56:57.751
Alack and allay! What lovely vassal
has Mercury delivered upon us today

56:57.857 --> 57:00.485
and in such strange
and frightful attire?

57:00.593 --> 57:01.719
Let us thank the gods

57:01.828 --> 57:05.094
for sending us such a brave
and valiant warrior to Xanthia.

57:05.199 --> 57:06.257
All hail Lunesta.

57:06.366 --> 57:07.663
Hail, Lunesta!

57:07.768 --> 57:09.292
How's it going?
Lunesta?

57:09.403 --> 57:11.166
Isn't that a sleeping pill?

57:11.271 --> 57:14.332
Yeah. It's 'cause I send my enemies
to their eternal resting place.

57:14.442 --> 57:16.706
"To sleep,
perchance to dream."

57:16.811 --> 57:20.212
Well, welcome, Lunesta.
We bid you good battle.

57:20.315 --> 57:22.681
Prepare to have your
worldview rocked.

57:22.785 --> 57:24.150
Let's do this.

57:24.253 --> 57:25.720
Let's do this,
we shall!

57:34.998 --> 57:38.297
The battle begins!

57:55.220 --> 57:56.585
Turn and fight, coward!

57:56.688 --> 57:59.179
You'll never catch me!

58:04.097 --> 58:05.758
What have you got?

58:06.633 --> 58:08.897
The Cacedonians have
our kinsmen surrounded.

58:09.002 --> 58:11.027
Leave them for Davith.

58:12.873 --> 58:15.671
Prepare for
a Glencracken!

58:21.315 --> 58:23.113
Comrades!

58:23.218 --> 58:24.708
Cacedonia!

58:28.890 --> 58:30.881
The king is
unprotected.

58:30.992 --> 58:33.484
I shall approach him
from the rear.

58:35.264 --> 58:36.697
God save you!

58:43.807 --> 58:46.571
Oh, fuck me. All right.
You got it. I got you.

58:46.677 --> 58:48.167
That's...
You look amazing.

58:48.278 --> 58:49.245
Thanks, man.

58:49.580 --> 58:50.911
You're dead.

58:51.014 --> 58:52.003
No way.
I killed you.

58:52.115 --> 58:54.516
You didn't kill me.
Now exeunt this battlefield.

58:54.619 --> 58:55.608
Wait a second.
That's not fair.

58:55.720 --> 58:56.778
Listen,
you little twerp.

58:56.888 --> 58:59.448
You've been slain by the
mighty king. Now get lost,

58:59.557 --> 59:01.422
and take some pride
in dying an honorable death.

59:01.526 --> 59:02.619
No, but I killed you.

59:02.728 --> 59:04.696
You can't kill me after
I already killed you.

59:04.797 --> 59:05.889
Davith of Glencracken.

59:05.998 --> 59:07.158
Yes, my liege.

59:07.266 --> 59:08.324
Didst he slay me?

59:08.434 --> 59:09.696
He doth not slay the king.

59:09.802 --> 59:10.928
You weren't even here
when it happened!

59:11.036 --> 59:12.230
Was too here.

59:12.339 --> 59:14.603
Everyone, I'm telling you
the truth. I killed the king!

59:14.708 --> 59:15.970
I...

59:17.077 --> 59:18.442
Why don't you
believe me? I swear...

59:18.545 --> 59:19.910
Dost the Xanthian
weep like a maiden?

59:21.081 --> 59:22.640
Why are you
laughing at me?

59:23.584 --> 59:24.608
What are you doing?

59:24.719 --> 59:25.879
Danny, I didn't...

59:25.987 --> 59:28.319
I killed the king.
- Oh, my God.

59:28.422 --> 59:29.650
You're lying.

59:30.191 --> 59:31.783
Are you calling me a liar?
You're a liar.

59:31.892 --> 59:34.327
Danny, just drop it. Let's just
get out of here. It doesn't matter.

59:34.429 --> 59:37.592
Are you telling me a kid
could slay the mighty king?

59:37.699 --> 59:40.998
Not a real king,
but you, yeah.

59:41.103 --> 59:42.799
You're lying. I can tell.
Danny, stop.

59:42.905 --> 59:44.202
He killed you.
Give him your hat.

59:44.307 --> 59:45.399
It's a crown.

59:45.508 --> 59:46.497
Give him your hat.
Danny.

59:46.609 --> 59:48.338
It's a crown, dude!

59:50.179 --> 59:51.271
Dude!
You're a liar.

59:51.381 --> 59:53.350
It's a piece of plastic.

59:54.151 --> 59:55.277
Okay, game over.

59:56.620 --> 59:59.020
You both are disqualified
from Laire forever.

59:59.123 --> 01:00:01.148
What?
Are you kidding me?

01:00:05.363 --> 01:00:07.024
Augie! Augie!

01:00:10.468 --> 01:00:11.730
Augie.

01:00:11.836 --> 01:00:12.997
Leave me alone.

01:00:13.205 --> 01:00:14.797
Look. I'm sorry.

01:00:14.907 --> 01:00:17.671
No, you're not sorry.
You don't care about any of this!

01:00:17.777 --> 01:00:19.574
This is so unfair!

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.845
Hey, come on, buddy.
I'm not your buddy!

01:00:25.952 --> 01:00:27.681
You're only doing this because
the judge is making you.

01:00:27.788 --> 01:00:29.847
And you know what?
That's fine if you don't give a shit,

01:00:29.956 --> 01:00:32.187
but you don't have to ruin it
for me, because I do give a shit!

01:00:32.293 --> 01:00:34.090
I give lots of shits!

01:00:37.932 --> 01:00:39.092
Look, it's gonna be okay.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.599
No, it's not gonna be okay!

01:00:40.702 --> 01:00:44.764
You're the worst mentor ever! No wonder
your girlfriend left you, you asshole!

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.444
Yo, Wheeler.
What's up, man?

01:00:58.555 --> 01:00:59.988
Hey. What's up?

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.184
Okay, kid. Let's mingle.

01:01:02.927 --> 01:01:04.360
Let's do it.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:08.357
Yeah.

01:01:11.602 --> 01:01:13.468
Excuse me, miss.
Yes?

01:01:14.906 --> 01:01:17.306
You're sexy like
a chocolate strawberry.

01:01:18.143 --> 01:01:19.235
Who told you to say that?

01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:20.470
That's Wheeler,

01:01:20.579 --> 01:01:21.877
my PIC.

01:01:26.085 --> 01:01:28.019
Nice.
Come on, baby!

01:01:28.121 --> 01:01:29.748
Pass it.
No.

01:01:29.856 --> 01:01:30.845
No.
No!

01:01:30.957 --> 01:01:32.289
Hey. I'm gonna
rock a squirt,

01:01:32.392 --> 01:01:33.586
so you watch the kid
for a few minutes?

01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:36.390
Sure thing. You're the king,
Wheeler. You're the king.

01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:39.023
Yeah, okay.

01:01:53.516 --> 01:01:54.642
Long line.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.718
I've seen longer.

01:01:56.819 --> 01:01:59.344
Have we met?
I don't know. Have we?

01:02:01.157 --> 01:02:02.853
Well, what do you do?

01:02:02.959 --> 01:02:05.553
Well, I'm kind of
on hiatus right now,

01:02:05.662 --> 01:02:08.859
but my job is to dress up like a
minotaur and keep kids off drugs.

01:02:08.965 --> 01:02:11.833
Well, that's how I know you.
I teach at Morgan Elementary.

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:14.769
That's so funny, 'cause I
think elementary school is hot.

01:02:19.824 --> 01:02:20.916
Hey.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.591
What are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.

01:02:23.695 --> 01:02:25.219
No, I don't want to
talk to you right now.

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:26.422
Hey, Danny.

01:02:26.532 --> 01:02:29.626
You decided to come for dinner.
Great. Come on in.

01:02:29.735 --> 01:02:32.136
Thanks.
God damn it!

01:02:34.007 --> 01:02:35.770
What's up his cooz?

01:02:40.313 --> 01:02:42.145
I should take a piss
more often.

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:45.618
I don't know.
I don't got a raincoat.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.254
Don't worry.
I'm very pro-choice.

01:02:48.422 --> 01:02:49.719
Okay.

01:02:50.091 --> 01:02:51.855
God, I'm really
kicking your ass.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.188
That's because
this is soccer.

01:02:53.295 --> 01:02:54.592
Black folks
don't play soccer.

01:02:54.696 --> 01:02:56.254
That guy's black.
Right there.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.465
You sit down,
young man.

01:03:01.571 --> 01:03:04.096
You have
been a bad boy!

01:03:04.207 --> 01:03:05.367
I've been bad.

01:03:05.475 --> 01:03:07.170
And now you're gonna
have to stay after class.

01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:09.073
Oh, man. Look.

01:03:09.178 --> 01:03:12.046
Even though this is one of my top
four all-time fantasies, I can't, okay?

01:03:12.149 --> 01:03:14.674
I want to, but I gotta
go find my friend.

01:03:15.452 --> 01:03:16.714
Oh, yeah?

01:03:17.588 --> 01:03:18.714
You sure?

01:03:19.256 --> 01:03:20.655
Oh, my God.

01:03:21.426 --> 01:03:23.360
Do what you need to do.

01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:25.691
He'll be fine.
He's 10. Come here.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:26.797
Let's go.

01:03:28.683 --> 01:03:29.206
Uh-oh!

01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:30.839
This is how it ends.

01:03:30.951 --> 01:03:32.510
Game winner! I win!

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.678
Let's go, Michael.

01:03:33.788 --> 01:03:35.221
Man, forget you, man.

01:03:35.323 --> 01:03:36.915
That's booty, son.

01:03:37.025 --> 01:03:38.253
Let's go. I'm ready.

01:03:39.627 --> 01:03:42.961
They don't call me the king
of this game for nothing!

01:03:47.236 --> 01:03:49.534
Wheeler, where you at?

01:03:54.744 --> 01:03:57.611
Wheeler? Wheeler. Wheeler.

01:03:58.014 --> 01:03:59.003
Wheeler.

01:04:01.652 --> 01:04:04.280
So, Danny, you must be glad
that you're almost done

01:04:04.388 --> 01:04:07.152
with your required
time with Augie.

01:04:08.359 --> 01:04:10.486
How much time
do you have left?

01:04:11.128 --> 01:04:13.029
Eleven, 12 hours or so.

01:04:13.131 --> 01:04:14.894
Jeez, Augie. You're acting
like your goldfish died.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.968
I don't have a goldfish, Jim.
You know what I mean.

01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:20.766
You're acting like as if you
had a goldfish and it died.

01:04:21.708 --> 01:04:24.302
Augie kind of got
screwed over today.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:25.570
I killed the king, Mom.

01:04:25.678 --> 01:04:27.077
Okay.
- He killed the king.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.375
All right. All right. Don't
encourage him. He did kill the king.

01:04:29.482 --> 01:04:31.610
But he was lying to everyone and
told everyone that he killed me.

01:04:31.719 --> 01:04:33.744
I don't wanna hear any more
about your Dungeons & Dragons

01:04:33.854 --> 01:04:35.116
or your fruity Cocoa Puffs...

01:04:35.222 --> 01:04:36.689
It's all fairyland
with him.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.691
We're trying to keep it...
We're trying to keep it real.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.024
The Goddess of Navalore
saw me cry, Mom.

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.564
Hey, Augie, when I was a
little kid, I accidentally

01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:46.691
crapped my pants
in front of a girl I liked,

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:48.996
so I feel your pain.

01:04:49.104 --> 01:04:52.370
Well, he likes girls. That's a
good thing. That's a surprise to me.

01:04:52.475 --> 01:04:54.340
Doesn't matter anyway.
He got me kicked out.

01:04:54.443 --> 01:04:56.104
What?
- What? You're kidding me.

01:04:56.212 --> 01:04:57.201
They can kick you out?

01:04:57.313 --> 01:04:58.803
Yeah, I'm banned.
This is a great thing.

01:04:58.915 --> 01:05:00.246
Way to go, big guy.
Does this mean

01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:01.442
we can finally get rid
of those boots

01:05:01.552 --> 01:05:05.648
and that God-awful cape that you made
out of my tablecloth? I'm so sick of this.

01:05:05.756 --> 01:05:06.814
I'll burn them up in a...

01:05:06.924 --> 01:05:08.892
We'll have a bonfire.
We'll make a thing of it.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:11.086
Don't you want him to wear
what makes him happy?

01:05:12.564 --> 01:05:13.531
Yes. Yes, I do.
Yes.

01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:16.122
You know when I want him to
wear what makes him happy?

01:05:16.234 --> 01:05:19.761
On October 31st.
Halloween, go nuts.

01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:21.134
Wear lipstick.
I don't care.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.400
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:24.305
You know, dress like a nun.
Sure.

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:25.707
We're gonna have
a celebration

01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:28.837
to celebrate you joining
the rest of the world.

01:05:28.948 --> 01:05:30.940
Becoming a normal kid.
He is a normal kid.

01:05:31.051 --> 01:05:32.678
You think he's normal?
- Yeah, I think he's normal.

01:05:32.786 --> 01:05:34.310
You think he's normal.
He's normal.

01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:35.410
When I was his age,

01:05:35.522 --> 01:05:38.616
I had four, five girlfriends at
one time. Didn't I tell you that?

01:05:38.725 --> 01:05:40.386
He was fucking
his cousin.

01:05:40.493 --> 01:05:42.052
I wasn't fucking
my cousin. I...

01:05:42.163 --> 01:05:44.461
We kissed, because I didn't
know she was my cousin,

01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:48.092
but when I found out, I stopped
kissing her, but I fucked her friends.

01:05:48.202 --> 01:05:50.136
I fucked my
cousin's friends.

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:53.503
I think that Augie is just having
kind of a tough time in life,

01:05:53.609 --> 01:05:55.270
which sounds pretty normal
to me. Life is tough.

01:05:55.377 --> 01:05:57.174
It is tough. But you know
what? This is my point.

01:05:57.279 --> 01:06:00.146
It's tougher when you...
With parents like you?

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:02.774
Excuse me?
What did you just say?

01:06:02.885 --> 01:06:06.218
I said it is tough, but I think
it's tougher with parents like you.

01:06:06.322 --> 01:06:07.550
I thought that's
what you just said.

01:06:07.657 --> 01:06:08.817
I don't know
how you do it, kid.

01:06:08.925 --> 01:06:11.918
I mean, I thought my life sucked.
Jesus Christ, I really feel for you.

01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:13.053
Okay. That's enough.

01:06:13.163 --> 01:06:14.460
Don't listen to
them, all right?

01:06:14.565 --> 01:06:16.537
Do what makes you happy.
You want to wear a cape?

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:16.931
Wear a cape.

01:06:17.034 --> 01:06:18.729
You want to wear a suit of armor?
Who gives a shit?

01:06:18.836 --> 01:06:21.237
You know what? I would never
have invited you over for moussaka

01:06:21.339 --> 01:06:24.775
if I'd known you were gonna
be such a prick. Excuse me.

01:06:24.876 --> 01:06:26.173
Augie, screw them.

01:06:26.277 --> 01:06:27.301
Do what makes you happy.
Hey. Whoa!

01:06:27.412 --> 01:06:29.559
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Do what makes you happy.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.108
Hey, buddy...

01:06:30.215 --> 01:06:31.444
I'd like you to
leave now, please.

01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:32.812
I figure you're probably

01:06:32.918 --> 01:06:34.681
not gonna sign my
hours sheet now.

01:06:34.787 --> 01:06:35.776
Go fuck yourself.

01:06:35.888 --> 01:06:38.584
That's what I thought.
Hey, Augie, I'm sorry.

01:06:38.691 --> 01:06:40.318
Get the hell out.

01:06:41.862 --> 01:06:44.456
I'd be psyched if he was my kid.
Please.

01:06:47.467 --> 01:06:48.593
And you know what,
sweetheart?

01:06:48.702 --> 01:06:50.967
It's not that we're not
psyched that you're our kid.

01:06:51.072 --> 01:06:54.041
We're psyched. I'm so
psyched, I can't stand it.

01:06:54.142 --> 01:06:56.133
Your mom's psyched
that you're her kid.

01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:58.439
May I please
be excused, Mom?

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.496
Hey. Where's Ronnie?

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.030
Who's Ronnie, dude?

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.566
Oh, shit. Ronnie!

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.363
Ronnie.

01:07:22.073 --> 01:07:24.132
What's up, man?
Hey. How you doing?

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.765
Ro-Ro.

01:07:26.811 --> 01:07:28.870
Anybody see the
little kid I was with?

01:07:31.116 --> 01:07:32.879
<i> This is Karen,
Ronnie's mother.</i>

01:07:32.984 --> 01:07:35.452
<i>Ronnie was supposed to be
home a few hours ago.</i>

01:07:36.722 --> 01:07:37.711
<i>This is Karen again.</i>

01:07:37.823 --> 01:07:41.453
<i>Can you guys please call me
and let me know where you are?</i>

01:07:42.028 --> 01:07:46.226
<i>Ronnie just got in. He walked all the way home.
What the hell...</i>

01:07:46.399 --> 01:07:47.496
You're out.
Look...

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.228
No, no, no, no. It's over.
You blew it. It's done. Okay?

01:07:50.337 --> 01:07:53.135
I hear what you're saying.
We're very sorry, but we're 11 hours short.

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:56.035
And you're gonna stay 11 hours
short, okay? I don't know.

01:07:56.143 --> 01:07:58.873
Parents don't want you hanging around
with their kids for some reason.

01:07:58.979 --> 01:08:02.006
So you BSed a BSer.

01:08:02.117 --> 01:08:05.951
Good for you! I hope you feel
good about yourself, God damn it!

01:08:07.522 --> 01:08:10.515
You know, I could be
back in New York

01:08:10.626 --> 01:08:13.686
doing cocaine in the
Village, but I'm not.

01:08:14.864 --> 01:08:17.594
You know why?
Kids come first.

01:08:18.868 --> 01:08:20.359
They don't come
first for you, do they?

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:22.961
They come second
to your selfishness.

01:08:23.774 --> 01:08:26.106
So why don't you
two guys go home,

01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:28.575
put down some lines
of selfishness,

01:08:28.678 --> 01:08:30.442
which is your blow,

01:08:31.048 --> 01:08:34.346
close the shades, take
the phone off the hook,

01:08:34.452 --> 01:08:36.920
grab a straw and snort?

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.149
And don't expect me
to testify on your behalf.

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:43.225
You're not Sturdy Wings
material.

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:52.901
I think you guys are gonna
have to go to jail.

01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:54.234
The only thing we can do now

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.639
is make a case at the hearing
that you did your best.

01:08:57.743 --> 01:08:59.769
It's gonna take some serious
lawyering on my part.

01:08:59.912 --> 01:09:02.906
Yeah. Beth, please.
Lawyer the shit out of it.

01:09:03.017 --> 01:09:05.451
I just can't promise
anything.

01:09:05.553 --> 01:09:07.145
Yes, Wheeler?
Question.

01:09:07.254 --> 01:09:09.688
Maybe a stupid one, but
I'm just spit-balling here.

01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:12.055
The Get Out of Jail Free
card,

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.890
is that based on
something that exists or...

01:09:14.996 --> 01:09:17.395
That wasn't
a stupid question.

01:09:17.499 --> 01:09:18.523
That's real.

01:09:18.633 --> 01:09:19.895
It's real in the
game of Monopoly.

01:09:20.002 --> 01:09:22.368
Yeah, it's based
on true events.

01:09:22.904 --> 01:09:24.270
How... What do you mean?

01:09:24.372 --> 01:09:25.430
Chance.

01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:35.277
I can't believe
we're going to jail.

01:09:35.385 --> 01:09:36.374
Believe it.

01:09:36.486 --> 01:09:38.249
Hey, maybe you'll
roll doubles. You know?

01:09:38.354 --> 01:09:39.582
If not, you just
miss three turns.

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:40.783
Game face, bro.

01:09:40.892 --> 01:09:42.553
I told you.
Game face.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.321
Enough with the
game face, all right?

01:09:44.429 --> 01:09:45.862
This isn't beach volleyball.

01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:49.229
Is it not? Because,
if you think about it,

01:09:49.334 --> 01:09:52.532
the net is like your goals
in life, and you are the ball.

01:09:52.638 --> 01:09:55.163
And you can spike the ball
down, or you, over the net.

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:57.799
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Then you go into sidelines.

01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:58.899
It's bad enough
I'm going to jail.

01:09:59.011 --> 01:10:00.877
I can't take it anymore
with you yapping away.

01:10:00.981 --> 01:10:01.970
Yap, yap, yip, yip.

01:10:02.082 --> 01:10:03.845
"Bang your drum, bro."
Maybe I should be like you.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.441
"I hate myself, yet I'm
better than everyone."

01:10:06.553 --> 01:10:08.453
You're one to talk.
You took a 10-year-old to a party

01:10:08.555 --> 01:10:10.421
and left him so you
could go get a blow job.

01:10:10.524 --> 01:10:11.616
Hey.

01:10:11.726 --> 01:10:13.216
It wasn't a blow job.
We fucked.

01:10:13.327 --> 01:10:15.318
Please! Watch
your language!

01:10:15.429 --> 01:10:16.953
Sorry.
Sorry.

01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:20.268
You are an
S-H-l-T-T-Y friend.

01:10:20.369 --> 01:10:21.961
He can spell.

01:10:23.639 --> 01:10:25.402
I'm not your friend.

01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:27.008
Oh.

01:10:27.276 --> 01:10:28.743
You wanna go?

01:10:31.748 --> 01:10:32.772
Stop it!

01:10:38.354 --> 01:10:41.290
There you go, Danny.
Now you got no friends.

01:10:44.295 --> 01:10:45.455
Sorry.

01:10:50.502 --> 01:10:52.902
Hello?
Hey, Ro-Ro. It's Wheeler.

01:11:40.957 --> 01:11:42.618
So you guys have to
be at the courthouse

01:11:42.726 --> 01:11:44.489
no later than
3:00 p.m., okay?

01:11:44.594 --> 01:11:45.583
All right.

01:11:45.695 --> 01:11:47.856
<i>Please, do not be late.
No. I know.</i>

01:11:47.964 --> 01:11:49.592
No, I'll be there.

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:41.980
You don't always have to get
breakfast this time of day.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.053
Hiya, King.

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:46.651
No, no, no. I don't
mean to cause trouble.

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:49.128
I just wanted to come
by and apologize

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.325
for the way that
I behaved last time.

01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:56.498
I... I lost my temper when I saw
you last, and that was regrettable.

01:12:56.606 --> 01:12:59.006
Not to mention highly
illegal, you jackanape.

01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:02.805
I know. It's just that my...
Denver omelet?

01:13:02.914 --> 01:13:04.939
Right here. Thank you.

01:13:06.184 --> 01:13:08.084
It's just my friend
was upset, you see,

01:13:08.186 --> 01:13:10.417
and he thought
he'd stabbed you.

01:13:10.522 --> 01:13:12.683
He hadn't.
Of course he hadn't.

01:13:13.459 --> 01:13:14.483
Go on.

01:13:14.593 --> 01:13:15.685
It's just that...

01:13:17.029 --> 01:13:20.932
I accidentally cast an
unbreakable madness spell on him.

01:13:22.469 --> 01:13:24.437
Well, that was stupid.
- I know, right?

01:13:24.537 --> 01:13:25.799
I didn't mean to.

01:13:25.905 --> 01:13:27.065
You guys are reckless
out there.

01:13:27.173 --> 01:13:30.666
Yeah. Unsafe. Okay, I had a
protection spell on me. All right?

01:13:30.778 --> 01:13:33.542
But it had faded off when you
touched me, so don't flatter yourself

01:13:33.647 --> 01:13:35.137
thinking you can come
back at me, okay,

01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:38.013
'cause I would love to see
you penetrate me again.

01:13:38.119 --> 01:13:39.747
Anyway, I was
just wondering

01:13:39.855 --> 01:13:42.119
if maybe you could
see it in your heart

01:13:42.224 --> 01:13:45.489
to let him fight today
on the battlefield.

01:13:45.594 --> 01:13:48.188
He loves Laire
more than anything.

01:13:48.296 --> 01:13:51.528
He's just a kid, but he's
got the heart of a lion...

01:13:52.301 --> 01:13:53.268
Hmm.

01:13:54.637 --> 01:13:56.195
...and the eye of the tiger.

01:13:56.305 --> 01:13:57.294
Hmm.

01:13:57.406 --> 01:13:58.634
More coffee?

01:13:58.741 --> 01:13:59.902
No, I'm decaf.

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:01.136
Okay.

01:14:01.245 --> 01:14:02.644
If he be so brave,

01:14:02.746 --> 01:14:05.738
why doth he not show
his face here today?

01:14:05.849 --> 01:14:07.783
Do you fight
all his battles?

01:14:07.885 --> 01:14:08.853
Hmm.

01:14:11.022 --> 01:14:12.956
He knows not I'm here.

01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:14.080
Hmm.

01:14:14.192 --> 01:14:17.787
He hath too
much pride.

01:14:18.396 --> 01:14:19.364
Hmm.

01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:25.798
Magic healing
potion. Wizards...

01:14:26.872 --> 01:14:28.499
How's it going?

01:14:31.311 --> 01:14:33.006
Tell your kinsman

01:14:35.815 --> 01:14:38.409
we shall see him
on the battlefield today.

01:14:38.518 --> 01:14:40.885
Thank you.
Thank you, noble king.

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:44.982
Really?

01:14:45.092 --> 01:14:46.059
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:46.694 --> 01:14:48.491
You know
you want it.

01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:55.265
Now exit my
Burger Hole, boy.

01:14:56.572 --> 01:14:59.974
Make it known to the Xanthians that
if they let Augie fight with them,

01:15:00.076 --> 01:15:03.443
we'll destroy each and every
one of them, without mercy,

01:15:03.546 --> 01:15:06.014
before the first
apple-cider break.

01:15:16.026 --> 01:15:18.358
Hey, what's up, my PIC?

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.564
Ronnie. Ronnie.

01:15:30.142 --> 01:15:32.337
To listen to me

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:36.711
and listen good.
I am a very animalistic woman,

01:15:36.816 --> 01:15:38.910
a very animalistic woman,

01:15:39.019 --> 01:15:43.422
and when it comes to my son,
I am a lioness,

01:15:43.523 --> 01:15:44.888
a black Sheba.

01:15:44.992 --> 01:15:46.550
Black Sheba.
Yeah, but listen...

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:47.752
I am a lioness,

01:15:47.861 --> 01:15:50.626
and that boy is my cub,

01:15:50.732 --> 01:15:54.691
and if you let anything bad
happen to my cub,

01:15:54.802 --> 01:15:59.103
I will claw your ass up
until you shit sideways.

01:15:59.208 --> 01:16:01.233
Do you understand?
Yes.

01:16:01.343 --> 01:16:03.971
You'll tear me up so bad that when
I shit, it'll come out sideways.

01:16:04.079 --> 01:16:05.842
I understand.
Okay.

01:16:08.618 --> 01:16:10.245
It's just, Ronnie looks
up to you. Okay?

01:16:10.353 --> 01:16:12.753
He doesn't need another
man leaving him behind.

01:16:12.856 --> 01:16:15.120
I know. I know.
I fucked up, okay?

01:16:15.225 --> 01:16:17.193
I... The kid acts
so tough,

01:16:17.294 --> 01:16:19.058
I didn't know I could
hurt him, you know?

01:16:19.163 --> 01:16:21.131
I'm determined to make
it up to him. All right?

01:16:21.232 --> 01:16:25.100
What I'm trying to say is that
when I get out of prison,

01:16:25.202 --> 01:16:27.534
could I hang out with
your 10-year-old son?

01:16:27.638 --> 01:16:30.574
Well, you're gonna have
to ask him yourself.

01:16:32.911 --> 01:16:34.640
Hey. Ronnie.

01:16:35.547 --> 01:16:36.514
Um...

01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:39.711
Look. I'm sorry, okay?

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.720
I know I don't deserve it,

01:16:42.822 --> 01:16:46.314
but Sturdy Wings or no Sturdy
Wings, I want to be your Big.

01:16:49.296 --> 01:16:53.733
Okay. I'm your Little, and
you're my Big. I like that.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:17:01.048
Can I tell you how deeply, deeply I
regret this situation with this latest Big?

01:17:01.156 --> 01:17:04.717
It's completely unacceptable,
and at Sturdy Wings,

01:17:04.826 --> 01:17:06.157
it's not how we roll.

01:17:06.261 --> 01:17:09.959
So I'm going to guarantee
you that Mr. Gary

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.827
is our most experienced
and dependable volunteer.

01:17:14.937 --> 01:17:16.495
Let me
put it this way.

01:17:16.605 --> 01:17:19.097
If I had a nickel for every year
that I've been with Sturdy Wings,

01:17:19.209 --> 01:17:22.178
I would have enough
money to

01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:23.746
<i>play a game of Pac-Man.</i>

01:17:24.748 --> 01:17:25.840
Been five years.

01:17:25.949 --> 01:17:28.316
And if I stay with Sturdy
Wings for another five years,

01:17:28.419 --> 01:17:30.819
then I'll have enough
for another round.

01:17:30.922 --> 01:17:32.389
<i>Another round of Pac-Man.
- Right.</i>

01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:35.254
Five cents for every year,
times five...

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.384
That's 25.
We get it.

01:17:36.494 --> 01:17:37.893
That's 25 cents.
- That's a quarter.

01:17:37.996 --> 01:17:40.227
<i>But the Pac-Man here,
I think it's 50 cents.</i>

01:17:44.103 --> 01:17:46.264
What are you doing here?
I'm breaking you out.

01:17:46.405 --> 01:17:48.772
There's a nation at war.
Are you in?

01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:50.274
Aye.

01:17:50.377 --> 01:17:52.675
Aye... I am, too.
Come on.

01:17:52.779 --> 01:17:55.213
<i>Wheeler hasn't called me back.
Are you guys gonna make it or what?</i>

01:17:55.315 --> 01:17:57.978
I don't know, Beth. I mean, I can't
speak for Wheeler, but I'll be there.

01:17:58.085 --> 01:18:00.246
<i>You gotta promise me.
Yeah, I promise. I just...</i>

01:18:00.354 --> 01:18:02.288
I'm helping Augie with something,
and then I'm on my way, okay?

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:04.915
<i>County courthouse, 3:00.
All right.</i>

01:18:06.327 --> 01:18:08.990
Man, I'm gonna kick
some Cacedonian ass.

01:18:09.097 --> 01:18:10.564
Yeah, totally.

01:18:11.967 --> 01:18:13.161
It's Artonius.

01:18:13.268 --> 01:18:14.735
Bid him good morrow.

01:18:14.836 --> 01:18:16.599
Greetings, Artonius.

01:18:16.705 --> 01:18:18.230
Get ready for some pain.

01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:21.472
What? What? Wait. No, no, no.
No, you can't do that.

01:18:21.577 --> 01:18:23.408
<i>You're out of Xanthia.
What are you talking about?</i>

01:18:23.513 --> 01:18:24.912
<i>Sorry, Blufgan.</i>

01:18:25.014 --> 01:18:26.311
Forget it, Danny.

01:18:27.383 --> 01:18:29.011
They said I'm too
much of a liability.

01:18:29.119 --> 01:18:31.644
They're kicking me
out of Xanthia.

01:18:31.755 --> 01:18:33.689
What? Are you serious?

01:18:35.025 --> 01:18:36.652
Screw them. We'll
start our own country.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.819
We can't.

01:18:37.929 --> 01:18:41.194
All my costumes have the same
colors and same symbols as Xanthia.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.665
And besides, you can't start
a country with two people.

01:18:43.768 --> 01:18:46.328
No? What's the minimum?

01:18:50.509 --> 01:18:51.737
Where you going?

01:18:52.211 --> 01:18:53.473
You can't go anywhere.
Come on.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.147
What do you want,
asshole?

01:18:56.248 --> 01:18:58.444
Actually, we
need your help.

01:19:39.797 --> 01:19:42.231
I can't believe
my eyes.

01:19:42.433 --> 01:19:44.424
A minotaur!

01:20:06.993 --> 01:20:08.325
Augie?

01:20:08.962 --> 01:20:10.224
Where are you?

01:20:15.402 --> 01:20:16.733
<i>Hear he, hear he.</i>

01:20:17.572 --> 01:20:20.939
This is a battle to the
last man standing,

01:20:21.309 --> 01:20:24.073
and the victor
shall rule the realm.

01:20:24.179 --> 01:20:27.946
There'll be no magical
rejuvenation powder today.

01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:31.076
Instead, if you are killed,
you are done!

01:20:31.754 --> 01:20:35.315
Fight well, and may
the best country win!

01:20:38.528 --> 01:20:40.928
Stay close, like
cotton on a lamb.

01:20:43.333 --> 01:20:46.530
Brothers and sisters of the
new nation of Kiss-My-Anthia,

01:20:46.636 --> 01:20:51.199
I stand here before you not as
the Augie Farks you once knew.

01:20:51.309 --> 01:20:54.301
Today I stand before
you a warrior!

01:20:54.912 --> 01:20:56.243
For time eternal,

01:20:56.347 --> 01:20:59.283
I have let the naysayers
of this world bring me down.

01:20:59.384 --> 01:21:02.251
They used to say,
"You shouldn't fight.

01:21:02.354 --> 01:21:04.788
"You should be
embarrassed of yourself.

01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:07.291
"You look like a young
Marvin Hamlisch."

01:21:07.393 --> 01:21:09.759
Well, you know what
I say to those naysayers?

01:21:09.862 --> 01:21:12.763
I say nay! I will fight!

01:21:12.865 --> 01:21:14.492
I will not be embarrassed!

01:21:14.601 --> 01:21:16.796
Who the fuck
is Marvin Hamlisch?

01:21:16.903 --> 01:21:18.132
<i>He wrote the music
to The Sting.</i>

01:21:18.239 --> 01:21:19.433
That's a good movie.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.167
But I don't care,

01:21:21.642 --> 01:21:24.440
'cause in this moment,
doing what I love,

01:21:24.545 --> 01:21:26.445
I know I have already won.

01:21:26.547 --> 01:21:30.177
An honorable, albeit court-appointed,
friend once said to me,

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:31.980
"Do what makes you happy."

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:36.456
And nothing would make me happier
than to fight alongside you brave men.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.384
When the elders
speak of this day,

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:41.929
they will speak of the courage
of Kiss-My-Anthia.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.623
Of the Spaceman.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:46.633
The Demon.

01:21:48.272 --> 01:21:49.762
The Starchild.

01:21:51.141 --> 01:21:52.904
And me, the Cat!

01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:55.877
So let us raise
our swords in victory,

01:21:55.979 --> 01:21:57.880
crank this shit up to 11,

01:21:57.982 --> 01:22:00.177
and let's rip this
realm a new asshole!

01:22:00.285 --> 01:22:01.274
Yeah!

01:22:01.386 --> 01:22:03.684
Yeah! What the fuck
are we talking about?

01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:07.885
May Xanthia and
Kiss-My-Anthia be allies.

01:22:07.993 --> 01:22:12.623
King Argotron be damned.
We fight with you.

01:22:12.731 --> 01:22:14.824
Thank you, friends.
Your honor is great.

01:22:14.933 --> 01:22:18.426
Come. Let us gingerly
touch our tips.

01:22:19.839 --> 01:22:22.108
Game on!

01:22:38.126 --> 01:22:39.354
Yeah!

01:22:48.271 --> 01:22:51.138
Once we pass this point,
there's no turning back.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.832
It's a fight
to the death!

01:22:52.942 --> 01:22:54.842
About time!
Let's rip this shit up!

01:22:54.944 --> 01:22:56.571
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:22:59.149 --> 01:23:01.709
Yeah. Oh, snap! No!

01:23:01.819 --> 01:23:03.411
Come on. No!

01:23:04.655 --> 01:23:07.147
Augie, what the hell?
Your boys just killed me!

01:23:07.258 --> 01:23:10.887
Retreat! Go! Like the leopard!
Like the leopard!

01:23:12.864 --> 01:23:14.525
Oh, Saint Venise!

01:23:18.003 --> 01:23:19.698
<i>Et tu, you two?</i>

01:23:20.906 --> 01:23:22.305
What the hell's going on?

01:23:22.408 --> 01:23:25.002
They killed you, so you have to
die an honorable and noble death.

01:23:25.111 --> 01:23:27.046
Okay. I think I can do that.

01:23:36.523 --> 01:23:38.116
Not bad.
Blufgan.

01:23:38.226 --> 01:23:39.750
Kuzzik.

01:23:39.861 --> 01:23:41.556
Fulfill your
destiny, Blufgan.

01:23:41.662 --> 01:23:42.788
Yes.
Kill the king.

01:23:42.897 --> 01:23:44.091
I will.
Kill the king.

01:23:44.198 --> 01:23:45.324
I will, Kuzzik!

01:23:45.433 --> 01:23:46.765
Go. Go.

01:23:47.336 --> 01:23:49.201
Go. Go.

01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:57.536
Take that, you
lily-livered coward!

01:23:59.182 --> 01:24:01.082
Hey.
Hey. Where the hell are you guys?

01:24:01.184 --> 01:24:02.674
I cannot stall any longer.

01:24:02.786 --> 01:24:05.084
I'm at Jefferson Park.
Look. I can't talk right now.

01:24:05.188 --> 01:24:07.953
I'm in the middle of
battling a Cacedonian.

01:24:08.058 --> 01:24:09.923
Beth, I gotta help Augie.
I gotta go.

01:24:10.027 --> 01:24:11.722
<i>Fucking Cacedonian ass.</i>

01:24:11.829 --> 01:24:14.764
What? Hello. What?

01:24:21.039 --> 01:24:22.267
Bitch!

01:24:22.374 --> 01:24:24.239
Retreat to the castle!

01:24:28.047 --> 01:24:30.311
Long live Xanthia!

01:24:43.697 --> 01:24:45.597
You lost an arm, honey!

01:24:48.269 --> 01:24:49.827
Nice one, dude.

01:24:50.505 --> 01:24:52.530
Hey, Esplen.
Thanks.

01:24:57.613 --> 01:25:00.081
Okay. See you.
See you.

01:25:02.751 --> 01:25:04.412
Die, coward!

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.386
Cacedonia
is to rule forever!

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:10.122
What a scene.

01:25:23.341 --> 01:25:26.071
Okay. We lost a man,
but we can still do this.

01:25:26.177 --> 01:25:28.703
It's not the manpower.
It's the power of the man.

01:25:28.847 --> 01:25:30.439
Shit, this kid really
jacks you up.

01:25:30.549 --> 01:25:32.278
I want you to go left
through these trees.

01:25:32.384 --> 01:25:33.510
His lackeys
are pretty strong,

01:25:33.619 --> 01:25:35.849
but Davith of Glencracken
is the one you want.

01:25:35.954 --> 01:25:38.116
He's the one built
like a brick shithouse.

01:25:39.993 --> 01:25:41.290
Leave it to us, Augie.

01:25:41.394 --> 01:25:43.191
<i>Good luck, mi amigos!</i>

01:25:44.864 --> 01:25:48.824
Thanks for doing this.
- I'm doing it for the kids, not for you.

01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:02.377
Come on.

01:26:09.692 --> 01:26:11.990
Feel the steel
of my hammer!

01:26:19.336 --> 01:26:21.770
Hey, hey! Okay! Okay!
I'm dead! I'm dead!

01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:23.999
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
It's fun though, right?

01:26:24.107 --> 01:26:25.938
It's a blast.
It's contagious. I know.

01:26:26.044 --> 01:26:27.636
Totally.
Come back next year.

01:26:27.745 --> 01:26:28.871
I will. Thanks. Okay.

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.345
We need people.
Give me your e-mail.

01:26:38.924 --> 01:26:41.392
Dude, you saved my life.

01:26:41.493 --> 01:26:43.927
I did what any good
coworker would do.

01:26:44.029 --> 01:26:47.158
I honestly can't say
I would do the same for you.

01:26:47.267 --> 01:26:50.327
You would, Danny,
because you're my friend.

01:26:51.137 --> 01:26:53.162
I want to hear you say it.

01:26:54.074 --> 01:26:55.735
Come on.
Say it.

01:26:58.045 --> 01:26:59.376
I'm your friend.

01:27:00.314 --> 01:27:02.339
Will you hold me?
No.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.781
Kiss on the cheek?
No.

01:27:03.884 --> 01:27:06.285
Hug me. I don't want to
do any of that.

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:09.551
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:11.057
Aren't you dead yet?

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.786
Very close, Starchild.

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.486
The end is near.

01:27:20.903 --> 01:27:22.427
Sleep, friend.

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:26.501
They can't hurt you now.

01:27:31.248 --> 01:27:33.716
Right in the ball
sack. Fuck.

01:27:35.219 --> 01:27:37.120
All right. I'm
gonna get a beer.

01:27:37.255 --> 01:27:39.184
Hold your ground!

01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:41.084
Enclose, stab.

01:27:41.192 --> 01:27:42.659
As you command.

01:27:42.761 --> 01:27:44.285
Yes, my lord.
North.

01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:47.661
Davith is gone.
Nice work.

01:27:47.767 --> 01:27:49.394
Where's Spaceman?

01:27:54.507 --> 01:27:56.806
I don't think there's many
warriors left, you know.

01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:58.104
If I could just get
him one-on-one,

01:27:58.211 --> 01:28:00.008
I swear I could take him.
I could take him down.

01:28:00.113 --> 01:28:03.014
Hold up, dude.
Methinks I have a plan.

01:28:05.485 --> 01:28:08.319
Hey, King! King!

01:28:09.357 --> 01:28:11.382
It's that guy from
The Burger Hole.

01:28:11.492 --> 01:28:13.824
Oh, he seems
to be wounded.

01:28:13.928 --> 01:28:15.156
Shall I take him out, sire?

01:28:15.263 --> 01:28:17.732
Nay. This one is mine.

01:28:28.344 --> 01:28:31.609
Well! Well, well.

01:28:35.886 --> 01:28:39.652
Looks like thou art fell for
the oldest trick in the scroll.

01:28:52.504 --> 01:28:56.066
Now you will kneel
before the king.

01:28:56.175 --> 01:28:59.611
Oh, drag. I really wanted to
win that pointy little hat.

01:28:59.712 --> 01:29:02.977
It's a crown!

01:29:10.924 --> 01:29:12.619
Cacedonia!

01:29:14.828 --> 01:29:15.887
You!

01:29:18.099 --> 01:29:19.225
Shit.

01:29:24.839 --> 01:29:27.673
Argotron. Face me,
if ye be brave enough.

01:29:27.777 --> 01:29:29.904
Didn't I teach you
a lesson the last time?

01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:33.470
I think you're afraid
I'm gonna kill you again.

01:29:35.117 --> 01:29:37.086
Go get them, Augie!

01:29:37.187 --> 01:29:39.519
You shut up, whore!
My mom is not a whore!

01:29:39.623 --> 01:29:41.022
Yes, she is!

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:50.366
He could actually win.
It's anyone's game.

01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:51.662
Go, Blufgan!

01:29:51.769 --> 01:29:53.202
Yo, Augie! Fuck
his shit up, man!

01:30:13.293 --> 01:30:14.726
Screw it!

01:30:14.828 --> 01:30:15.853
Bad decision.

01:30:15.963 --> 01:30:17.692
No, it's a good decision.

01:30:22.937 --> 01:30:24.336
Oh, shit!

01:30:32.881 --> 01:30:34.974
It's okay.
I don't need it.

01:30:44.627 --> 01:30:45.720
Hey!

01:30:46.597 --> 01:30:48.326
Please. No.

01:31:15.328 --> 01:31:16.659
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:17.855
That's what
I'm talking about!

01:31:17.964 --> 01:31:19.056
Yes!

01:31:20.634 --> 01:31:22.659
The gods have
played a coup.

01:31:22.769 --> 01:31:25.762
Blufgan is the last man
standing of them all!

01:31:26.974 --> 01:31:30.740
All hail King Blufgan!

01:31:31.479 --> 01:31:33.470
Hail, Blufgan!

01:31:36.952 --> 01:31:38.385
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:54.294
What? Esplen is still alive?

01:31:56.006 --> 01:31:56.995
Esplen!

01:31:57.107 --> 01:31:59.200
I was hiding in the
bushes the whole time.

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:00.641
That's a pretty
smart strategy.

01:32:00.744 --> 01:32:03.577
Thanks.
Sorry I killed you.

01:32:03.681 --> 01:32:05.206
It's okay.

01:32:05.317 --> 01:32:09.378
All hail Queen Esplen
of Navalore!

01:32:09.688 --> 01:32:11.986
Hail, Esplen!

01:32:18.197 --> 01:32:21.997
Game end!

01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:28.104
One slice to the king's chest
and down like a sack of elderberries!

01:32:30.677 --> 01:32:32.235
You did good, Augie.

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:33.938
I mean, a girl did beat you,

01:32:34.047 --> 01:32:36.608
but it's definitely not as
gay as I thought it would be.

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:39.915
You were incredible.
Second place!

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:42.785
That's like a silver medal. Kind of
makes you hungry for the gold, huh?

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:47.721
No, but we...
Serious, we are very, very proud of you.

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:50.492
Thanks for trying to
be nice, Mom. Jim.

01:33:04.314 --> 01:33:05.976
Hail, Esplen!

01:33:06.751 --> 01:33:08.013
Congratulations.

01:33:08.119 --> 01:33:09.347
I can't believe I won.

01:33:09.453 --> 01:33:11.683
When I killed you,
I was, like, "No way."

01:33:11.789 --> 01:33:14.759
Yeah, well, the crown looks
very good on you, very regal.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:17.158
Thanks.
I liked your whiskers.

01:33:17.262 --> 01:33:18.695
Thanks.
Was that eyeliner?

01:33:18.797 --> 01:33:20.924
Yeah, I just drew them on.

01:33:21.033 --> 01:33:22.227
It looked good.

01:33:22.334 --> 01:33:24.701
Thanks.
I have two cats, so...

01:33:24.804 --> 01:33:27.500
Oh. Okay. Cool.

01:33:27.607 --> 01:33:29.131
So, Augie,

01:33:30.209 --> 01:33:34.009
now that I'm queen,
I was wondering if maybe

01:33:35.182 --> 01:33:36.809
you'd wanna be my king?

01:33:36.917 --> 01:33:39.511
Yeah. I'd love that.

01:33:40.954 --> 01:33:43.252
Should...
Should I kiss you now?

01:33:51.566 --> 01:33:52.931
Fuck, yeah.

01:33:59.375 --> 01:34:02.276
<i>Do you know the
song Beth? By Kiss?</i>

01:34:02.711 --> 01:34:04.942
You did a really good
thing tonight, Wheeler.

01:34:05.048 --> 01:34:06.345
Yeah. They'll probably
double our sentence

01:34:06.450 --> 01:34:07.940
for not showing up to the
hearing this afternoon.

01:34:08.051 --> 01:34:11.452
Well, listen. I got a long-standing
relationship with this judge,

01:34:11.555 --> 01:34:14.787
and I don't want to get too graphic,
but I used to suck his dick for drugs.

01:34:14.892 --> 01:34:16.416
Oh.
He got me my junk.

01:34:16.527 --> 01:34:19.792
Long story short, you
guys are not going to jail.

01:34:19.897 --> 01:34:22.297
Are you BSing me?
'Cause I know you're the best BSer.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.424
No, I'm being straight
with you, man.

01:34:24.801 --> 01:34:25.733
Shit. Thank you.

01:34:25.836 --> 01:34:26.803
Whoa! Okay.

01:34:26.937 --> 01:34:27.926
Thank you so much.
All right.

01:34:28.038 --> 01:34:29.630
Hey, what's going on here?

01:34:31.341 --> 01:34:33.866
So speaking of whatever you
guys were just talking about,

01:34:33.977 --> 01:34:38.472
I happen to know a really nice
Italian restaurant in Manhattan Beach,

01:34:38.583 --> 01:34:41.143
and I would love to take you
if you're interested.

01:34:41.252 --> 01:34:42.742
Sure, Martin.

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:45.321
I just hope we're talking
pasta and not pussy.

01:34:45.424 --> 01:34:48.393
Well, I was talking about
two adults having some pasta,

01:34:48.494 --> 01:34:51.691
and, yes, I was kinda hoping
that it would lead to some pussy.

01:34:51.797 --> 01:34:53.662
Call it out there.

01:34:53.766 --> 01:34:55.325
I mean, what are we after here?
Okay.

01:34:55.435 --> 01:34:59.201
Quiet down! Quiet down!
Gather round, ye nobles!

01:35:14.938 --> 01:35:18.135
<i>Beth, I hear you calling</i>

01:35:18.242 --> 01:35:22.372
<i>But I can't come
home right now</i>

01:35:22.479 --> 01:35:26.007
<i>'Cause me and the
boys are slaying</i>

01:35:26.117 --> 01:35:30.315
<i>And we just can't
find the sound</i>

01:35:31.156 --> 01:35:33.386
<i>None of these lyrics</i>

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:37.654
<i>Have anything to do
with what I want to say</i>

01:35:38.697 --> 01:35:41.097
<i>But it's got a pretty melody</i>

01:35:41.867 --> 01:35:44.530
<i>And I get to sing your name</i>

01:35:46.139 --> 01:35:48.164
<i>That seems pretty cool</i>

01:35:51.077 --> 01:35:53.602
<i>Beth, you are so awesome</i>

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:57.945
<i>And I miss you so much</i>

01:35:58.052 --> 01:35:59.576
<i>Your beautiful smile</i>

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:02.952
<i>And your positive attitude
and your whispering eye</i>

01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:08.925
<i>We don't have to get married</i>

01:36:09.031 --> 01:36:12.091
<i>But I'm still in love with you</i>

01:36:12.968 --> 01:36:15.961
<i>We can just be together</i>

01:36:16.873 --> 01:36:19.774
<i>Like Tim Robbins
and Susan Sarandon</i>

01:36:19.876 --> 01:36:21.434
Good actors.

01:36:21.878 --> 01:36:23.209
<i>Tim and Sue</i>

01:36:25.216 --> 01:36:28.447
<i>Beth, I am so
lonely without you</i>

01:36:28.552 --> 01:36:31.544
<i>And I hope we'll be all right</i>

01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:35.152
<i>You and me should make up</i>

01:36:37.762 --> 01:36:41.630
<i>Tonight</i>

01:36:43.903 --> 01:36:45.962
And the kiss!

01:36:46.873 --> 01:36:47.965
Nice.

01:37:32.589 --> 01:37:35.218
Hey, what does this
look like to you?

01:37:40.798 --> 01:37:43.461
Hey.
- How you doing?

01:37:45.003 --> 01:37:46.436
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:37:52.477 --> 01:37:53.809
Yes, sir.
Yeah.

01:37:54.881 --> 01:37:55.870
Put it back in.

01:37:55.982 --> 01:37:57.847
Ouch. Ouch.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:37:58.351 --> 01:37:59.818
There you go.
