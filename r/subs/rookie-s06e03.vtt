WEBVTT

00:02.347 --> 00:03.796
We made it!

00:03.934 --> 00:06.040
Say "honeymoon day one."

00:06.178 --> 00:09.699
Honeymoon day one!

00:09.837 --> 00:11.114
Are you taking a picture?

00:11.252 --> 00:12.426
Video.

00:12.564 --> 00:14.014
I wanted to see how long
until you broke.

00:14.152 --> 00:15.360
Hi. I'm Rafael.

00:15.498 --> 00:17.051
- Hello!
- That's my daughter, Elise.

00:17.189 --> 00:18.570
Elise, hi, I'm John.
That's Bailey.

00:18.708 --> 00:19.950
- Hello!
- Hi.

00:20.089 --> 00:21.607
And we run
the Oceanside Dreams.

00:21.745 --> 00:23.540
I know that you booked
our luxury villa.

00:23.678 --> 00:24.817
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:24.955 --> 00:26.026
So let's get you
in there, yeah?

00:26.164 --> 00:27.303
Oh, I like
the sound of luxury.

00:27.958 --> 00:29.581
You did say, villa, right?

00:29.719 --> 00:31.238
Yes. Yes, sir.

00:31.376 --> 00:33.723
We're still recovering
from the last few hurricanes.

00:33.861 --> 00:35.621
The power goes out sometimes.

00:35.759 --> 00:39.453
The internet works sometimes.

00:39.591 --> 00:42.766
But to us,
this is still paradise.

00:42.904 --> 00:44.078
Totally.

00:44.216 --> 00:46.563
It's just that the pictures
on the website,

00:46.701 --> 00:48.082
they look a little different.

00:48.220 --> 00:49.911
Yes, exactly.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.673
We used AI
to generate renderings.

00:52.811 --> 00:55.434
So those are photos of
what the place feels like,

00:55.572 --> 00:57.229
yeah, according to the AI.

00:57.367 --> 00:59.611
That's what separates us
from the other resorts.

00:59.749 --> 01:00.853
The false advertising?

01:02.717 --> 01:03.787
What was that?

01:03.925 --> 01:05.720
Oh, um...

01:05.858 --> 01:08.551
possums, most likely.

01:08.689 --> 01:10.415
They are loud.

01:10.553 --> 01:12.244
But rest assured,
if you hear anything at all,

01:12.382 --> 01:15.765
it's either a mating sound
or a killing sound.

01:15.903 --> 01:17.905
Happy honeymoon.

01:18.043 --> 01:21.253
OK.

01:21.391 --> 01:22.254
That's good.

01:22.392 --> 01:23.600
No, this is gonna be great.

01:23.738 --> 01:25.292
- Mm-hmm.
- This is--

01:25.430 --> 01:27.328
I am so sorry.

01:27.466 --> 01:29.468
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪</i>

01:29.606 --> 01:33.023
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

01:36.924 --> 01:39.237
Hey, did you get any sleep?

01:39.375 --> 01:41.929
I will sleep
when I pass this exam.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.206
Yeah.

01:43.344 --> 01:44.759
I don't think
you're gonna sleep more

01:44.897 --> 01:46.140
after you make detective.

01:46.278 --> 01:47.452
How's it going?

01:47.590 --> 01:49.764
I feel pretty good
about my knowledge.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.835
I mean, the written
portion was easy.

01:51.973 --> 01:54.735
But the oral exam
is what is literally

01:54.873 --> 01:56.323
keeping me up at night.

01:56.461 --> 01:58.739
I mean, the test
is so subjective.

01:58.877 --> 02:01.121
If even one person on the panel
has it against me,

02:01.259 --> 02:02.467
I mean, it's over.

02:02.605 --> 02:04.020
And you think Lieutenant
Primm still hates you?

02:04.158 --> 02:05.470
I brought him
homemade cookies,

02:05.608 --> 02:06.678
and he threw them in the trash.

02:06.816 --> 02:08.887
OK. You can't control Primm.

02:09.025 --> 02:11.476
You can only control you.

02:11.614 --> 02:12.925
And now it's time for you

02:13.063 --> 02:14.168
to step away
from the highlighter.

02:14.306 --> 02:15.721
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

02:15.859 --> 02:17.516
That's exactly right, though.
See?

02:17.654 --> 02:20.968
Because I can only control me,
so I just need to be perfect.

02:21.106 --> 02:22.314
You can over-prepare.

02:22.452 --> 02:24.765
No, that is an idea
that lazy people created.

02:24.903 --> 02:26.491
No, I've seen it happen, OK?

02:26.629 --> 02:28.286
You get in your own head.

02:28.424 --> 02:32.462
You just need to trust yourself
and then let it go.

02:33.877 --> 02:36.432
Yeah, I don't think
I can do that.

02:36.570 --> 02:37.847
All right.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.124
I'm gonna take a shower.

02:39.262 --> 02:40.332
Right now?

02:40.470 --> 02:42.023
Yeah.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.680
Well--

02:46.200 --> 02:47.822
Hmm, maybe
I could take a break.

02:51.101 --> 02:52.551
It was a wedding, you know.

02:52.689 --> 02:56.521
Everything was all romantic--
music, soft light--

02:56.659 --> 03:00.697
and I kind of...

03:00.835 --> 03:02.492
kissed Celina.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.770
Celina, who you work with?

03:04.908 --> 03:07.221
Celina, who saved your life
when you were shot?

03:07.359 --> 03:09.050
That Celina?
- Yeah.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.087
Did I mention the light?

03:11.225 --> 03:12.744
Because I really believe,
like, the mood lighting

03:12.882 --> 03:14.159
was 20% responsible.

03:14.297 --> 03:15.229
How did she react?

03:15.367 --> 03:16.782
Not good.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.026
Yeah, the look she gave me was
somewhere between horrified

03:19.164 --> 03:22.029
and really horrified.

03:22.167 --> 03:23.927
She doesn't share
your feelings?

03:26.516 --> 03:28.760
I'm not sure I share
my feelings, you know.

03:28.898 --> 03:31.901
We've been so close,
and she was the only person

03:32.039 --> 03:33.351
I could talk to.
- Look.

03:33.489 --> 03:35.249
It's very natural to
confuse that kind of bond

03:35.387 --> 03:36.561
with something romantic.

03:36.699 --> 03:38.425
OK. So--so what do I do?

03:38.563 --> 03:39.874
How do I fix this?

03:40.012 --> 03:42.877
You and Celina have been
through a lot together.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.465
You have a shared trauma.

03:44.603 --> 03:45.777
And as tempting as it is

03:45.915 --> 03:47.710
to want everything fixed
overnight,

03:47.848 --> 03:50.333
that's not how
these things work.

03:50.471 --> 03:52.093
Now, when you say trauma,
are you talking

03:52.232 --> 03:54.613
about Celina rejecting me
or me getting shot?

03:54.751 --> 03:58.790
Because they have been equally
traumatizing in my eyes.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.723
You're both adults.

04:00.861 --> 04:02.345
Clear the air.

04:02.483 --> 04:04.968
Set some healthy boundaries
and give her time.

04:05.106 --> 04:07.247
OK.

04:09.973 --> 04:13.253
Are we starting an OnlyFans?

04:13.391 --> 04:15.669
I thought we would
want to remember

04:15.807 --> 04:16.946
this honeymoon forever.

04:17.084 --> 04:19.431
Now of course, I'm not so sure.

04:19.569 --> 04:21.157
Is this a button cam?

04:21.295 --> 04:22.158
Mm-hmm.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.504
- A drone?
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.642 --> 04:25.541
Are we launching
an intelligence agency?

04:25.679 --> 04:30.373
It came as a package,
and it was on sale.

04:30.511 --> 04:32.789
And I got excited.

04:32.927 --> 04:34.032
Can I show you?

04:34.170 --> 04:36.172
This one is waterproof.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.933
It makes it perfect
for swimming, kayaking.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.211
Or we can do that thing where
we go cage diving with sharks.

04:41.350 --> 04:42.765
We can't.
They don't have it here.

04:42.903 --> 04:44.076
- Oh.
- I made sure.

04:44.214 --> 04:47.114
This one attaches right to us.

04:47.252 --> 04:49.841
So when we go zip lining
and you're zipping on past

04:49.979 --> 04:51.670
and I'm watching
from the ground,

04:51.808 --> 04:54.155
we can cut into it later from
all sorts of different angles.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.158
OK, and this one is
a button camera in case

04:57.297 --> 04:58.608
we have to go undercover,

04:58.746 --> 05:00.817
break up any monkey
drug cartels.

05:00.955 --> 05:02.371
And what about this one?

05:02.509 --> 05:04.338
Oh, why is it so dark?

05:04.476 --> 05:05.995
Hang on a second.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.548
Night vision.
- No.

05:07.686 --> 05:08.756
- Yes.
- No.

05:08.894 --> 05:10.344
Totally.
Just listen.

05:10.482 --> 05:11.690
Listen.

05:11.828 --> 05:14.314
I was thinking we can take
one of these, set it up,

05:14.452 --> 05:16.143
you know, outside.

05:16.281 --> 05:17.800
See what the possums are doing.

05:17.938 --> 05:19.422
Oh, yeah, totally,
that's what you were thinking.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.492
It is what I was thinking.

05:20.630 --> 05:21.700
What were you thinking?

05:21.838 --> 05:22.839
I think you know
what I was thinking.

05:22.977 --> 05:24.807
- Hey, I'm married.

05:29.294 --> 05:30.813
Celina, hi!

05:30.951 --> 05:32.849
Aaron.

05:32.987 --> 05:34.886
Are you cleared
for active duty?

05:35.024 --> 05:36.681
No, uh, not yet.

05:36.819 --> 05:39.408
Soon.

05:39.546 --> 05:42.238
I, um--
I got something for you.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.377
Picked it up
on the way to work.

05:43.515 --> 05:45.552
Oh.
No, you didn't have to do that.

05:45.690 --> 05:47.416
Surprise. New laptop.

05:47.554 --> 05:51.281
Aaron, that's
completely unnecessary.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.388
Yeah, but you were saying
how your computer was slow.

05:54.526 --> 05:56.045
I know what you're doing.

05:56.183 --> 06:00.152
You're trying
to apologize for the--

06:00.290 --> 06:03.224
for the kiss,
but you don't have to.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.571
OK?

06:04.709 --> 06:06.504
OK.

06:09.196 --> 06:10.680
Yeah.

06:12.579 --> 06:13.959
Anybody want a laptop?

06:14.097 --> 06:15.582
Yeah. Yeah, I'll take it!

06:15.720 --> 06:18.239
The murder scene exception
is the misbelief

06:18.378 --> 06:20.897
that when a crime scene
is so heinous,

06:21.035 --> 06:23.106
you are allowed to go
around the search warrant.

06:23.244 --> 06:25.281
Correct again.
Next question.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.697
What is my favorite
leisure activity?

06:27.835 --> 06:29.216
Um, excuse me?

06:29.354 --> 06:31.943
You know, am I more
of an outdoor or indoor cat?

06:32.081 --> 06:35.878
Smitty, please just read
from the cards I gave you, OK?

06:36.016 --> 06:37.397
Look, you asked me
for my advice.

06:37.535 --> 06:38.398
I did not!

06:38.536 --> 06:39.640
And my advice is,

06:39.778 --> 06:41.159
you should do
a little research on Primm.

06:41.297 --> 06:44.438
Find out his likes,
his dislikes, favorite hobbies.

06:44.576 --> 06:46.406
Then you can take
that knowledge

06:46.544 --> 06:49.167
and score some bonus points.

06:49.305 --> 06:52.412
I'm worried that
I focused too much on Aaron

06:52.550 --> 06:55.484
after the attack
and did you a disservice,

06:55.622 --> 06:57.520
let you fall
through the cracks.

06:57.658 --> 06:58.832
Oh, thank you, sir,

06:58.970 --> 07:00.903
but I'm fine.

07:03.146 --> 07:04.424
What about the wedding?

07:04.562 --> 07:05.666
You went rogue.

07:05.804 --> 07:08.013
You know better
than to meet with a CI

07:08.151 --> 07:09.946
without alerting
other officers.

07:10.084 --> 07:11.258
I do.
I just thought that--

07:11.396 --> 07:13.260
It would impress me?

07:14.330 --> 07:15.504
Yes.

07:15.642 --> 07:16.815
Well, it didn't.

07:16.953 --> 07:18.990
That situation could
have ended a lot worse.

07:19.128 --> 07:21.337
Don't ever do it again.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.477
Harper is needed
back with the detectives.

07:23.615 --> 07:25.824
He'll be riding with Sergeant
Bradford until Nolan returns.

07:25.962 --> 07:27.516
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

07:27.654 --> 07:29.449
Get the war bags, Boot.
Set up the shop.

07:32.106 --> 07:33.487
He's a major dog guy.

07:33.625 --> 07:35.040
He goes to the shelter
every weekend

07:35.178 --> 07:36.559
looking for new ones to foster.

07:36.697 --> 07:38.596
And he won't stop
until he sets them up

07:38.734 --> 07:40.252
with their forever homes.

07:40.390 --> 07:42.047
Wait, what--
that is beautiful.

07:42.185 --> 07:43.497
I am also a dog lover.

07:43.635 --> 07:44.878
What's going on here?

07:45.016 --> 07:46.845
I'm helping Chen study
for her detective's exam.

07:46.983 --> 07:48.191
Smitty.

07:48.329 --> 07:49.503
What happened
to not over-preparing?

07:49.641 --> 07:51.678
It's Smitty.
Is it even really helping?

07:51.816 --> 07:52.851
What?

07:52.989 --> 07:54.335
I just need a few minutes.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.372
No, you need to take a break.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.822
I got Celina today.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.237
Come on. You're riding with us.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.549
Oh!

08:00.687 --> 08:02.033
Well, that actually sounds
kind of fun.

08:02.171 --> 08:03.931
The second you two start
talking about birth charts,

08:04.069 --> 08:05.346
I'm kicking you both
out of the car.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.417
OK.
Thank you, Smitty, thank you.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.766
I've done all I can do.

08:10.904 --> 08:12.837
The rest is up to her.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.564
Right.

08:15.702 --> 08:17.151
Elise was right.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.740
This place is beautiful!

08:19.878 --> 08:22.536
And all we really need
is each other, you know?

08:22.674 --> 08:24.193
Oh! Unbelievable.

08:24.331 --> 08:25.574
What?

08:25.712 --> 08:27.403
Oh, I'm just checking
the possum camera, man.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.853
They were really going at it.

08:28.991 --> 08:30.751
Fighting or... you know?

08:30.889 --> 08:32.201
I thought we were
the only ones staying

08:32.339 --> 08:33.582
on this end of the island.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.102
Uh, maybe he got here
after us?

08:37.240 --> 08:38.483
He looks introspective.

08:38.621 --> 08:40.174
He looks like a vampire

08:40.312 --> 08:41.762
trying to avoid sunlight
at all costs.

08:41.900 --> 08:42.763
Oh.

08:42.901 --> 08:43.764
- Oh.
- Oh.

08:43.902 --> 08:44.765
Oh!

08:44.903 --> 08:46.871
I wasn't expecting that.

08:47.388 --> 08:48.907
Just because you brought
all the cameras

08:49.045 --> 08:50.944
doesn't mean you can use them
all the time.

08:51.082 --> 08:52.393
You're totally right.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.636
Be in the moment.

08:53.774 --> 08:55.258
No, it's--I can hear
what you're saying.

08:55.396 --> 08:56.259
Oh.

08:56.397 --> 08:58.089
Wait a second.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.573
Update.

08:59.711 --> 09:01.402
He is not a vampire.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.785
He is eating... avocado toast?

09:04.923 --> 09:06.994
So who do you think he is?

09:07.132 --> 09:11.481
Uh, I'm gonna go with
billionaire playboy

09:11.620 --> 09:13.345
faking his own death,
went under the knife

09:13.483 --> 09:15.175
to change his features
to start a new life

09:15.313 --> 09:16.590
with a secret second family.

09:16.728 --> 09:19.282
Billionaire?
But he chose to stay here.

09:19.420 --> 09:21.457
Oh. Yeah, maybe he's lost.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.839
I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, no, wait.

09:23.977 --> 09:25.634
What if he just wants
to be left alone?

09:25.772 --> 09:27.774
Or even worse, he doesn't
want to be left alone,

09:27.912 --> 09:30.121
and then we have a third wheel
for the rest of our honeymoon.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.813
I just want
to get a read on him.

09:32.951 --> 09:34.056
And don't worry,
I'll make it sound

09:34.194 --> 09:35.816
like we're old and no fun.

09:35.954 --> 09:38.647
By the time I'm done, he won't
want to be anywhere near us.

09:38.785 --> 09:40.269
OK.

09:40.407 --> 09:42.754
You can make us sound
a little fun.

09:42.892 --> 09:44.100
"Hi, I'm John Nolan.

09:44.238 --> 09:48.449
That over there is
my stunning wife, Bailey."

09:48.588 --> 09:49.830
"Oh!

09:49.968 --> 09:51.729
Wow, yes,
she is really beautiful."

09:51.867 --> 09:53.351
"Yeah, she is.

09:53.489 --> 09:55.767
"Did I also mention
she's talented and smart

09:55.905 --> 09:57.493
and funny and--"

09:57.631 --> 09:58.494
"That's so amazing.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.047
You're so lucky, dude."

10:00.185 --> 10:02.394
I made sure my radio
batteries are charged up.

10:02.532 --> 10:04.776
And I have a spare one here
too because you never know.

10:04.914 --> 10:06.813
I threw an extra case
of water in the back, so--

10:06.951 --> 10:08.021
Juarez.

10:08.159 --> 10:10.126
I'll stop.

10:10.264 --> 10:12.750
Hey, what's going on
with you and Aaron?

10:12.888 --> 10:13.992
Nothing. Why?

10:14.130 --> 10:15.166
Well, I saw you guys
in the parking lot,

10:15.304 --> 10:17.271
and it looked awkward.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.170
Huh, I don't know.

10:20.136 --> 10:22.587
OK, just a little.
I just--whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:22.725 --> 10:24.727
- Both of you, out now.
- Whoa.

10:24.865 --> 10:25.901
You said no birth charts.

10:26.039 --> 10:27.765
You didn't say we couldn't
talk about boys.

10:27.903 --> 10:29.767
That goes without saying.

10:29.905 --> 10:31.354
We will talk at lunch.

10:31.492 --> 10:33.322
<i>Seven-Metro-one hundred,
I have a four-eighty-four</i>

10:33.460 --> 10:35.600
<i>in progress at Bellevue
& East Kensington.</i>

10:35.738 --> 10:37.533
Show us responding.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.301
I've got this.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.578
Sir!

10:48.717 --> 10:50.615
I need you to stop right there.

10:50.753 --> 10:53.169
Oh, is--is something
going on with--

10:53.307 --> 10:55.171
Oh, we got a report
of someone shoplifting

10:55.309 --> 10:56.897
at this location.

10:57.035 --> 10:58.105
Wasn't me.

10:58.243 --> 11:00.245
Well, can you raise
your arms for me?

11:06.044 --> 11:07.080
I'm sorry.

11:07.218 --> 11:10.117
I just--my arm really hurt,

11:10.255 --> 11:11.912
and I don't have any money.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.500
OK, we need to get you
to the hospital.

11:13.638 --> 11:15.364
What's your name?

11:15.502 --> 11:16.917
I don't know.

11:17.055 --> 11:18.850
Well, it says here
your name is Jonathan Knight,

11:18.988 --> 11:20.680
and you work
for Trusted Security.

11:20.818 --> 11:22.854
Is that my name?

11:22.992 --> 11:24.097
Jonathan Knight.

11:24.235 --> 11:25.270
OK, drop the act.

11:25.408 --> 11:26.306
Lying about your name
isn't gonna

11:26.444 --> 11:27.583
keep us from arresting you.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.378
Cuff him.
- No! No, no, no, no.

11:29.516 --> 11:31.173
I--I woke up,
and I was just bleeding!

11:31.311 --> 11:33.106
And I saw
the convenience store.

11:33.244 --> 11:36.765
I--I don't remember
anything from before that.

11:36.903 --> 11:38.698
All righty, let's go.

11:38.836 --> 11:41.390
Is that plaster dust?

11:41.528 --> 11:43.116
I--I don't know.

11:45.221 --> 11:46.844
Are you buying any of this?

11:46.982 --> 11:48.535
Not a word.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.261
I mean, the gash in his arm
is real enough.

11:51.538 --> 11:52.884
- Oh!

11:55.024 --> 11:56.681
I don't feel that good.

11:56.819 --> 11:58.062
No, it's OK. It's OK.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.822
We're gonna--we're gonna
take you to the hospital.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.927
No, no.

12:01.065 --> 12:02.376
Pukester is going
in an ambulance,

12:02.514 --> 12:03.723
and you're going with him.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.693
Can we talk about
that guy from breakfast?

12:08.831 --> 12:11.213
I mean, that was weird.

12:11.351 --> 12:13.663
When I asked him his name,
it took him a full five seconds

12:13.802 --> 12:15.113
to tell me it was Dean.

12:15.251 --> 12:16.425
It's probably
'cause he's on pain meds.

12:16.563 --> 12:19.221
Any kind of facial surgery
is quite serious.

12:19.359 --> 12:20.601
I don't know.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.534
Told me a wonky story
about a dog attack.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.951
Something about it
just doesn't smell right.

12:25.089 --> 12:27.919
Can you turn your cop brain
off for just a few hours

12:28.057 --> 12:29.265
so we can go kayaking?

12:29.403 --> 12:30.473
Of course I can.

12:30.611 --> 12:32.752
Let me just land
this little beauty.

12:32.890 --> 12:33.787
Oh.

12:33.925 --> 12:35.099
- Don't be alarmed.
- Careful.

12:35.237 --> 12:36.272
Lands with the touch
of a button.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.240
Hey--ooh.

12:39.068 --> 12:40.760
And I'm sorry.

12:40.898 --> 12:43.521
Could you just state it
one more time for the record?

12:43.659 --> 12:45.419
- You beat me.
- Uh-huh.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.593
Which means?

12:46.731 --> 12:49.458
Which means that I lost.

12:49.596 --> 12:51.115
You really had
a staggering improvement.

12:51.253 --> 12:53.289
If you ever wanted
a second career change,

12:53.427 --> 12:54.704
you could be
a professional kayaker.

12:54.843 --> 12:55.740
Oh.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.293
And what is the lesson here?

12:57.431 --> 12:58.778
That don't make everything

12:58.916 --> 13:01.125
a contest unless
I'm sure I can win.

13:01.263 --> 13:03.921
That's right.

13:04.059 --> 13:05.681
Did we leave that open?

13:07.545 --> 13:10.065
Maybe it was
like that before?

13:10.203 --> 13:11.652
Yeah.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.171
We were just too distracted

13:13.309 --> 13:14.794
by the grandeur of this place
to notice?

13:14.932 --> 13:18.383
What time is it?

13:18.521 --> 13:20.834
It's 8:30.

13:20.972 --> 13:22.974
Oh, perfect!

13:27.254 --> 13:28.221
OK.

13:28.359 --> 13:29.947
Just a second to lie down.

13:30.085 --> 13:32.225
Then we'll grab some dinner.

13:48.897 --> 13:53.039
Bailey and I had somewhat
of a stressful morning.

13:53.177 --> 13:55.869
The camera I left on
last night recorded

13:56.007 --> 13:59.183
someone standing outside
our window watching us sleep.

13:59.321 --> 14:01.599
- For almost an hour.
- Right.

14:01.737 --> 14:04.913
So I have charged
all the cameras.

14:05.051 --> 14:07.225
We are setting up
a small but very

14:07.363 --> 14:09.089
technologically advanced
perimeter.

14:09.227 --> 14:11.747
Let's see if he wants
to come back.

14:13.231 --> 14:14.715
Watch me sleep now.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.062
<i>♪ All gold teeth,

14:16.200 --> 14:17.201

It's on.

14:25.381 --> 14:26.935
Are we being crazy?

14:27.073 --> 14:30.041
Somebody watched us sleep
last night for an hour.

14:30.179 --> 14:31.353
That's crazy.

14:31.491 --> 14:34.287
Why can't we have,
like, a normal honeymoon?

14:34.425 --> 14:35.978
Tell you what, let's take
the first ferry out of here.

14:36.116 --> 14:37.566
When we get home,
we're gonna book a trip

14:37.704 --> 14:39.568
to the most normal place
we can find.

14:42.709 --> 14:43.641
It's Elise.

14:43.779 --> 14:44.987
Coming!

14:45.125 --> 14:46.575
<i>♪ I like my girls

14:46.713 --> 14:48.128
- Hey, there.
- Housekeeping.

14:48.266 --> 14:49.267
Come on in.

14:49.405 --> 14:50.924
Brought you two
some fresh towels.

14:51.062 --> 14:52.443
Thank you.

14:52.581 --> 14:54.928
Um, Elise, when is
the next ferry out of here?

14:55.066 --> 14:57.931
No ferry today
or tomorrow probably.

14:58.069 --> 15:00.485
It's about as reliable as
the internet and the power.

15:00.623 --> 15:01.970
But I'm sure it'll be up
and running by the time

15:02.108 --> 15:03.143
you guys check out.

15:03.281 --> 15:04.489
What if there was a problem?

15:04.627 --> 15:05.974
Is there a problem?

15:06.112 --> 15:07.872
No, no. That's it.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.805
Thank you.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.738
OK, let me know
if you need anything else.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.015
- All right.
- OK.

Well, we are stuck here
for a few more days.

15:20.471 --> 15:22.645
So we might as well
make the most of it.

15:22.783 --> 15:24.993
Shall we go for a swim?
- Sure, of course.

15:25.131 --> 15:26.235
Yeah, let's make
the best of this.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.000
Hey, Luna.
How's the new job going?

15:32.138 --> 15:33.622
Energizing, mostly.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.727
Being a patient advocate
is rewarding.

15:35.865 --> 15:38.109
Um, we're actually here
to check up on a patient

15:38.247 --> 15:39.248
that we brought in yesterday.

15:39.386 --> 15:40.249
He claimed to have amnesia.

15:40.387 --> 15:41.561
Right.

15:41.699 --> 15:43.149
The John Doe in 415.

15:43.287 --> 15:45.116
I have called other hospitals,
homeless shelters,

15:45.254 --> 15:47.498
rehab facilities--
anything I can think of.

15:47.636 --> 15:49.534
No one has reported him
missing.

15:49.672 --> 15:51.640
Do the doctors think
he'll get his memory back?

15:51.778 --> 15:52.882
Probably.

15:53.021 --> 15:54.298
But brain injuries
can be tricky,

15:54.436 --> 15:55.747
so it could be a few months.

15:55.885 --> 15:56.783
OK. Thanks.

15:56.921 --> 15:58.819
We'll go talk to him.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.994
Hey, how's Aaron?

16:01.132 --> 16:02.927
He's fine, I think.

16:03.065 --> 16:04.929
I--I don't know.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.137
I sense trouble.

16:06.275 --> 16:07.690
No, no, not at all.

16:09.830 --> 16:11.349
OK, maybe a little.

16:11.487 --> 16:13.179
He kissed me at the wedding
out of nowhere.

16:13.317 --> 16:16.009
And now I'm...

16:16.147 --> 16:17.079
Angry?

16:17.217 --> 16:18.115
Yeah.

16:18.253 --> 16:19.495
I think he was just confused.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.187
And I mean, the way I reacted,

16:21.325 --> 16:22.533
it must have been
so embarrassing.

16:22.671 --> 16:25.018
And I'm sure he wants to forget
it ever happened.

16:25.156 --> 16:27.296
I'm hearing a lot about
what you think Aaron's feeling.

16:27.434 --> 16:30.679
But you can't know
until you talk it through.

16:33.406 --> 16:35.511
- Hey.
- Mm.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.273
Did you find something?

16:38.411 --> 16:39.377
You know who I am?

16:39.515 --> 16:40.930
I'm afraid not.

16:41.069 --> 16:42.518
Look, we contacted
Trusted Security.

16:42.656 --> 16:43.933
They have never heard of you.

16:44.072 --> 16:46.108
And we can't find
a Jonathan Knight

16:46.246 --> 16:48.248
matching your description
in California.

16:49.525 --> 16:51.907
Well, I have been
thinking about it.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.497
And I think the only
rational answer is that...

16:55.635 --> 16:57.188
I'm a spy.

16:57.913 --> 16:59.432
- Not my first guess.
- No.

16:59.570 --> 17:01.951
No, it makes sense.
It's a cover identity.

17:02.090 --> 17:03.712
I was probably
infiltrating a high-rise

17:03.850 --> 17:05.403
full of government secrets.

17:05.541 --> 17:06.611
Maybe I got poisoned.

17:06.749 --> 17:08.096
That's why I threw up.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.305
You know, like radiation
poisoning or something?

17:10.443 --> 17:12.652
Yeah, you know,
let's not jump to conclusions.

17:12.790 --> 17:16.138
You probably threw up
because you're concussed.

17:16.276 --> 17:18.934
Korea. North Korea.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.832
Wait, it's all
coming back to me now.

17:20.970 --> 17:22.903
I--I was targeting North Korea.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.390
And I had a partner,
and we were on a mission.

17:26.528 --> 17:27.874
Do you know where he is?

17:28.012 --> 17:29.082
He could be in danger.

17:29.220 --> 17:30.428
We need to find him.

17:30.566 --> 17:32.396
Um, do you know
your partner's name

17:32.534 --> 17:34.329
or when you last saw him?

17:38.229 --> 17:39.817
- No.
- Mm.

17:41.577 --> 17:42.923
OK, we're on it.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.718
We'll get back to you.

17:46.030 --> 17:48.067
You turned off the TV?

17:48.205 --> 17:49.792
Any chance he's right?

17:49.930 --> 17:51.208
We ran his prints.

17:51.346 --> 17:52.381
If he worked
for a three-letter agency,

17:52.519 --> 17:53.486
it would have set off alarms.

17:53.624 --> 17:55.108
Yeah. I mean, maybe.

17:55.246 --> 17:57.593
But the way he talked about
his partner, that felt real.

17:57.731 --> 17:59.457
Maybe there's some
kernel of truth there.

17:59.595 --> 18:01.010
You saw the news.

18:01.149 --> 18:02.495
He's just repeating
the last thing he saw on TV.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.945
Maybe there's some
memory that's surfacing,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.534
and he just can't make sense
of what it really means.

18:07.672 --> 18:08.811
Maybe.

18:08.949 --> 18:10.089
Regardless, there's not
much we can do

18:10.227 --> 18:11.400
until he starts
to remember more.

18:11.538 --> 18:12.608
Mm.

18:18.614 --> 18:19.960
Excuse me.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.101
Have you seen
Officers Bradford and Chen?

18:22.239 --> 18:23.481
Mm-mm.

18:23.619 --> 18:25.621
Then I'm in trouble.

18:25.759 --> 18:27.313
Look at this.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.627
There she is.

18:31.765 --> 18:34.458
So nice.

18:34.596 --> 18:36.149
Oh.

18:37.599 --> 18:39.842
Bailey!

18:42.776 --> 18:44.053
Normal honeymoon!

18:44.192 --> 18:47.022
Just wanted a normal honeymoon.

18:48.023 --> 18:49.680
OK.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.630
OK.
This is John Nolan, LAPD.

19:08.768 --> 19:10.804
With me is Bailey Nune, EMT.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.704
We have just discovered
a dead body.

19:13.842 --> 19:16.534
Uh, female, 30s, Martha--

19:16.672 --> 19:17.880
Oh, Delgado.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.365
Her body is still stiff.

19:19.503 --> 19:20.883
She's been dead
for at least eight hours.

19:21.021 --> 19:23.714
Wasn't in the water long enough
to sustain much damage.

19:23.852 --> 19:25.267
It's such a tragedy.

19:25.405 --> 19:27.511
I gotta say, it's not as
uncommon as you might think.

19:27.649 --> 19:28.753
What do you mean?

19:28.891 --> 19:30.721
Well, even people
who grew up here,

19:30.859 --> 19:32.723
they sometimes
underestimate the undertow.

19:32.861 --> 19:35.898
They have a few drinks,
they go for a night swim,

19:36.036 --> 19:38.556
and then--then this happens.

19:38.694 --> 19:40.040
Well, that may be.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.352
But I'm sure you'll agree,

19:41.490 --> 19:42.905
we do need to call
some professionals

19:43.043 --> 19:43.906
to determine
what really happened.

19:44.044 --> 19:45.356
Oh, of course.

19:45.494 --> 19:47.220
I already called the constables
on the main island.

19:47.358 --> 19:49.464
And they said they're gonna
get here as soon as they can.

19:49.602 --> 19:50.741
It's usually just
a couple of days

19:50.879 --> 19:52.570
with the accidental drowning.

19:52.708 --> 19:54.745
But we'll put poor Martha here

19:54.883 --> 19:57.437
in the walk-in fridge
until they arrive.

19:57.575 --> 19:59.094
Right.
Oh! I've got bars.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.407
I've got a bar.
I'm gonna--would you?

20:01.545 --> 20:03.271
There you go.

20:05.238 --> 20:09.104
Why is Nolan FaceTiming me
from his honeymoon?

20:09.242 --> 20:11.417
Are you calling
to rub in how beautiful

20:11.555 --> 20:13.453
your island paradise is?

20:13.591 --> 20:14.523
<i>I wish.</i>

20:14.661 --> 20:15.766
<i>Place is run down,</i>

20:15.904 --> 20:17.285
<i>phone and internet
are very spotty,</i>

20:17.423 --> 20:18.631
<i>there was a creeper
outside our window</i>

20:18.769 --> 20:19.770
<i>watching us sleep for an hour,</i>

20:19.908 --> 20:21.289
<i>and now we found a body.</i>

20:21.427 --> 20:22.290
A body?

20:22.428 --> 20:23.705
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:23.843 --> 20:25.707
<i>The housekeeper just
washed up on the beach.</i>

20:25.845 --> 20:27.778
<i>Something is wrong here,</i>

20:27.916 --> 20:31.506
<i>and local law enforcement
is non-existent.</i>

20:31.644 --> 20:33.749
<i>I'm worried somebody
maybe found out I was a cop</i>

20:33.887 --> 20:36.062
<i>and is targeting--could you--</i>

20:36.200 --> 20:37.753
Nolan.

20:37.891 --> 20:39.548
Seems like he needs
some backup.

20:39.686 --> 20:41.757
Are you suggesting
a trip to the tropics?

20:41.895 --> 20:43.897
I wasn't, but now I am.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.071
Hm.

20:45.209 --> 20:49.144
Sergeant Grey,
we have a problem.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.939
Uh, Nolan just called.

20:51.077 --> 20:53.044
They found a dead body
on the beach.

20:53.182 --> 20:55.599
Why do I feel like I should
be more surprised about that?

20:55.737 --> 20:58.084
Yeah, he and Bailey are
basically trouble magnets.

20:58.222 --> 20:59.741
- Hmm.
- He doesn't have his gun.

20:59.879 --> 21:01.156
No backup.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.364
And now he's in the middle
of an active crime scene.

21:02.502 --> 21:03.883
We want to go down there.

21:04.021 --> 21:05.712
To an island where
you have no jurisdiction?

21:05.850 --> 21:08.853
By the time you get the funds
approved to book the travel,

21:08.991 --> 21:10.993
he'll be celebrating
his anniversary.

21:11.131 --> 21:12.236
I can put it
on Wesley's card,

21:12.374 --> 21:13.858
which is also
technically my card.

21:13.996 --> 21:15.515
He's always saying
we should take a vacation.

21:15.653 --> 21:17.897
And then the department
can reimburse us.

21:18.035 --> 21:20.865
You know they won't
cover first class.

21:21.003 --> 21:22.764
But the trust fund does.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.559
OK, seriously,

21:24.697 --> 21:26.837
do you think
Nolan needs saving,

21:26.975 --> 21:28.287
or are you just trying
to get out the office?

21:28.425 --> 21:31.531
Who says two things
can't coexist?

21:37.641 --> 21:39.021
Hey! Hey!

21:39.159 --> 21:42.093
Uh, Celina,
can we talk after shift?

21:42.231 --> 21:43.854
It's not fine.

21:43.992 --> 21:45.131
Come again?

21:45.269 --> 21:47.789
I know I said
this morning that the--

21:47.927 --> 21:49.169
that the kiss wasn't
a big deal.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.379
But the truth is,
I still feel weird.

21:52.897 --> 21:55.244
And I have to be OK with that.

21:55.383 --> 21:57.108
You need to be OK with that.

21:57.246 --> 21:58.489
Yeah, of course.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.596
How?

22:03.183 --> 22:05.807
I--I don't know.

22:06.842 --> 22:08.361
I want us to get back
to normal too.

22:08.499 --> 22:10.743
But it's--it's going
to take some time, OK?

22:10.881 --> 22:13.815
And it will be weird
until it isn't.

22:14.954 --> 22:16.196
Boot!

22:18.371 --> 22:19.579
I'm about to hang
a bell around your neck,

22:19.717 --> 22:20.753
'cause I keep losing you.

22:20.891 --> 22:22.237
You get that paperwork
all done?

22:22.375 --> 22:23.411
Oh, yes, sir.

22:23.549 --> 22:24.412
Is there anything else you need

22:24.550 --> 22:25.516
before I end my shift?

22:25.654 --> 22:26.621
What do you think?

22:26.759 --> 22:28.070
I--

22:28.208 --> 22:29.313
You are all done.

22:29.451 --> 22:31.108
Clock out. Good work today.

22:31.246 --> 22:32.351
Thank you.
Good night.

22:32.489 --> 22:34.629
Good night.

22:36.562 --> 22:39.081
Would it kill you to give her
some acknowledgment?

22:39.219 --> 22:40.600
I'm trying to help her
become a good cop,

22:40.738 --> 22:41.981
not boost her self-esteem.

22:42.119 --> 22:43.776
Yeah, but when
you're teaching someone,

22:43.914 --> 22:45.433
it's important to tell them
what they're doing right

22:45.571 --> 22:47.504
as well as what
they can improve upon.

22:47.642 --> 22:49.195
Yeah, it sounds
like a good plan

22:49.333 --> 22:50.714
if you're going for mediocre.

22:50.852 --> 22:52.716
Have I not
softened you at all?

22:52.854 --> 22:54.925
Is it weird that I'm nervous?

22:55.063 --> 22:56.202
No, it's not weird.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.273
This is creepy.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.450
Huh.

23:04.555 --> 23:05.763
Oh.

23:05.901 --> 23:09.215
Does that sound like mating
or killing to you?

23:10.803 --> 23:12.183
Power is out.

23:12.321 --> 23:16.740
Fortunately, walk-in fridge
runs on a backup generator.

23:16.878 --> 23:17.741
Are you ready?

23:17.879 --> 23:18.949
Part of me is

23:19.087 --> 23:21.123
and a part of me
just feels sad.

23:21.261 --> 23:22.884
I hate seeing someone
kept like this.

23:23.022 --> 23:24.333
Same here.

23:24.472 --> 23:25.645
Best thing we can do for her
is trying to figure out

23:25.783 --> 23:26.750
what really happened.

23:26.888 --> 23:27.958
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

23:28.096 --> 23:29.753
Some cameras here.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.964
All right.
I am John Nolan, LAPD.

23:34.102 --> 23:35.483
This is Bailey Nune, EMT.

23:35.621 --> 23:40.626
We're doing an external autopsy
on Martha Delgado.

23:40.764 --> 23:42.386
We found her
in the water yesterday.

23:42.524 --> 23:44.940
Time of death was estimated
eight hours prior.

23:45.078 --> 23:46.735
She's been in cold storage
for six hours,

23:46.873 --> 23:49.428
giving us approximately
14 hours postmortem.

23:49.566 --> 23:50.946
Her fingers look good.

23:51.084 --> 23:52.638
Usually with some
sort of poisoning,

23:52.776 --> 23:55.434
there's a color change
or white lines on the nails.

23:55.572 --> 23:57.263
Not seeing any bruising.

23:57.401 --> 23:58.713
Oh.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.128
Hang on a sec.

24:00.266 --> 24:04.097
Got a--it's a laceration
behind her left ear.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.824
Did she hit her head
when she fell in the water

24:06.962 --> 24:09.344
or was she hit
and then fell in?

24:09.482 --> 24:11.691
No way to tell
without a proper autopsy.

24:11.829 --> 24:13.003
Let's go through her pockets,

24:13.141 --> 24:14.004
see if there's
anything in there

24:14.142 --> 24:15.281
that might fill in the blanks.

24:15.419 --> 24:16.524
Oh.

24:16.662 --> 24:17.766
John.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.459
What is that?

24:20.597 --> 24:21.598
A bandage claw.

24:21.736 --> 24:22.771
Maybe she picked it up

24:22.909 --> 24:24.221
when cleaning Dean's room.

24:24.359 --> 24:26.913
And then took it for a swim
with all her clothes on?

24:27.051 --> 24:29.122
Do you think he killed her?

24:29.260 --> 24:30.710
I don't know.

24:30.848 --> 24:32.954
But I am starting to think
we need to check out his cabin.

24:36.302 --> 24:37.372
- Where's your hand?

24:37.510 --> 24:39.201
I'm right here.
It's so dark.

24:40.824 --> 24:42.066
The lights are off.

24:42.204 --> 24:43.205
Yeah,
and the power's out too.

24:43.343 --> 24:44.344
So that's no help.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.036
You think he's in there?

24:47.451 --> 24:49.798
Only one way to find out.

24:49.936 --> 24:51.766
OK.

24:57.219 --> 24:58.704
Empty. Let's go.

24:58.842 --> 24:59.981
OK.

25:03.018 --> 25:04.537
OK.

25:04.675 --> 25:06.401
This guy travels light.

25:12.856 --> 25:14.271
There.
- OK.

25:14.409 --> 25:15.514
Great.

25:17.481 --> 25:18.620
Oh, wait.

25:18.758 --> 25:20.380
I found something. Here.

25:22.693 --> 25:24.523
What is this?

25:26.179 --> 25:27.422
Oh.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.355
That is not your average
hunting equipment.

25:29.493 --> 25:32.254
OK, um...

25:32.392 --> 25:33.601
there's no serial number.

25:33.739 --> 25:35.534
- Let's take the ammo.
- What if he misses it?

25:35.672 --> 25:37.743
Well, better than
him using it.

25:37.881 --> 25:39.538
Wait, wait.

25:48.685 --> 25:50.756
I'm jamming the barrel.

25:50.894 --> 25:51.929
Here. That'll do it.

25:52.067 --> 25:53.413
- Let's go.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.449
It's him.

25:54.587 --> 25:55.761
Back door.

25:58.004 --> 26:00.420
Go, go, go.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.837
What are you doing?
- The camera.

26:02.975 --> 26:04.079
Come on!

26:04.217 --> 26:05.564
Let's go, let's go!

26:11.846 --> 26:13.537
That was close.

26:17.748 --> 26:19.163
OK.

26:19.301 --> 26:20.682
He's still there.

26:20.820 --> 26:22.132
Maybe he's
calling it a night?

26:22.270 --> 26:24.099
Or coming to try
to murder us.

26:24.237 --> 26:26.101
The nearest island is
at least three hours away.

26:26.239 --> 26:28.103
We could grab a kayak
and be there by sunrise.

26:28.241 --> 26:29.449
So we notify police.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.658
They head over here,

26:30.796 --> 26:32.625
arrest Dean before
he finishes breakfast.

26:32.763 --> 26:35.352
What do you say?
Kayaking by moonlight?

26:35.490 --> 26:37.147
- I'll race you there.
- Yeah.

26:37.285 --> 26:39.390
So there's an issue
with our escape plan.

26:39.528 --> 26:42.428
I mean, this took work!

26:42.566 --> 26:44.775
Must have done that while
we were examining the body.

26:44.913 --> 26:47.467
He knows we're onto him.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.886
This has certainly been
a memorable honeymoon.

26:52.024 --> 26:54.233
There's no one else I'd rather
spend it with than you.

26:54.371 --> 26:55.890
Oh, sweetie.

26:58.237 --> 26:59.790
I mean, except
you may be better off

26:59.928 --> 27:02.310
with Harper or Lopez.

27:02.448 --> 27:04.312
Or Tim or Lucy.

27:04.450 --> 27:06.486
Right. Grey, Celina.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.626
Aaron.

27:07.764 --> 27:09.144
Heck,
I'd even accept Smitty

27:09.282 --> 27:11.146
right now
if he brought his gun.

27:18.050 --> 27:19.568
That's Elise.
She looks bad.

27:19.707 --> 27:20.880
I'm gonna go.
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:21.018 --> 27:21.985
It's OK.
It's OK.

27:22.123 --> 27:23.434
I will be right back.
- John, no!

27:23.572 --> 27:24.884
- I'll be right back.
- No.

27:25.022 --> 27:26.679
Oh, my God.

27:35.032 --> 27:36.689
Hey!

27:37.828 --> 27:39.071
- No--

27:45.111 --> 27:46.354
John!

28:10.654 --> 28:12.311
What time is it?

28:14.865 --> 28:16.833
Oh, my God, it's so late.

28:16.971 --> 28:17.937
You needed to sleep.

28:18.075 --> 28:19.767
No, I should be studying.

28:19.905 --> 28:21.251
Ah, take the morning off.

28:21.389 --> 28:22.631
Don't you feel better?

28:23.909 --> 28:25.911
You know, I do.

28:26.049 --> 28:27.222
Thank you.

28:32.158 --> 28:33.781
Oh, my God.

28:33.919 --> 28:35.575
My test is in 20 minutes!

28:35.714 --> 28:36.749
What? How?

28:36.887 --> 28:38.544
They moved it up!

28:39.890 --> 28:41.547
No service. You?

28:42.997 --> 28:44.101
Nope.

28:44.239 --> 28:45.585
Which means
we can't track their phones

28:45.724 --> 28:47.864
or get an ETA on our backup.

28:48.002 --> 28:49.279
I don't like this.

28:49.417 --> 28:51.315
Yeah, there is no one
around to greet you.

28:51.453 --> 28:53.386
Or hear you scream.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.564
That--that was just
an animal, right?

28:58.702 --> 29:00.359
Sure. But just in case.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.266
OK.

29:12.267 --> 29:14.442
Um, hi, I'm Lucy Chen,

29:14.580 --> 29:16.271
and I'm here for
the detective's exam.

29:16.409 --> 29:17.583
- Chen.
- Mm-hmm.

29:17.721 --> 29:18.964
Right.

29:19.102 --> 29:21.138
Take a seat.

29:21.276 --> 29:23.796
They'll be with you
in a few hours.

29:23.934 --> 29:26.523
Um--no, um, but I got
a text from them.

29:26.661 --> 29:28.490
They said that
they needed me right away.

29:28.628 --> 29:30.216
What can I tell you?

29:30.354 --> 29:31.528
Over there.

29:31.666 --> 29:33.495
They'll get to you
when they get to you.

29:33.633 --> 29:35.083
Hey. How's she doing?

29:35.221 --> 29:36.291
Celina or Lucy?

29:36.429 --> 29:37.361
Both.

29:37.499 --> 29:38.811
Celina is making progress.

29:38.949 --> 29:40.226
I think she's riding
with me again today.

29:40.364 --> 29:43.195
Lucy's in the test now
waiting her turn.

29:43.333 --> 29:44.679
I'll be glad when this is done.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.439
Hey, I did some research
on the security badge

29:46.577 --> 29:47.786
our John Doe was wearing.

29:47.924 --> 29:50.167
The company patrols
dozens of businesses in LA.

29:50.305 --> 29:53.032
He kept talking about
North Korea, right?

29:53.170 --> 29:54.654
Well, one
of the office buildings

29:54.793 --> 29:56.725
is in Koreatown,
just a few blocks

29:56.864 --> 29:57.830
from where we found him.

29:57.968 --> 29:59.383
Why the fake badge?

29:59.521 --> 30:02.455
The company has a diamond
exchange on the fourth floor.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.802
And you think
he was gonna rob it?

30:03.940 --> 30:05.389
Exactly.
I think something went wrong.

30:05.527 --> 30:07.288
He got injured
and lost his memory.

30:08.358 --> 30:09.738
Not any better ideas.

30:09.877 --> 30:11.223
Let's go check it out.

30:11.361 --> 30:13.639
Great work.

30:13.777 --> 30:15.227
Let's go, Boot.

30:19.231 --> 30:20.819
Clear.

30:28.067 --> 30:31.243
They put up cameras
all over the place.

30:31.381 --> 30:32.727
All right.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.246
The last footage has to be
uploaded somewhere.

30:34.384 --> 30:36.696
Let's get this charged,
see what we can find.

30:43.565 --> 30:46.672
All right, so which wall is
the diamond exchange behind?

30:46.810 --> 30:49.088
That one.

30:49.226 --> 30:50.538
OK.

30:50.676 --> 30:52.091
So it looks like
he tried to break

30:52.229 --> 30:54.714
into the diamond exchange
through a shared wall,

30:54.853 --> 30:58.270
fell through the ceiling,
knocked himself out instead.

30:58.408 --> 31:00.272
- Is someone there?

31:00.410 --> 31:01.480
Hello?

31:01.618 --> 31:04.345
Hey, man, get me out of here!

31:04.483 --> 31:06.209
Police. Someone in there?

31:06.347 --> 31:07.866
Help me. I'm stuck!

31:26.643 --> 31:29.473
Thank God you found me.

31:29.611 --> 31:31.268
I knew Roger wouldn't
leave me behind.

31:31.406 --> 31:32.580
I knew it.

31:32.718 --> 31:35.272
I just wish you got here
five minutes earlier...

31:35.410 --> 31:37.205
before I drank my own urine.

31:49.666 --> 31:50.805
Officer Chen.

32:06.234 --> 32:07.097
Good evening.

32:07.235 --> 32:08.098
Thank you for--

32:08.236 --> 32:09.824
It's been a long day,

32:09.962 --> 32:11.239
so let's just get right to it.

32:12.447 --> 32:14.553
What would you do
if a member of the press

32:14.691 --> 32:16.796
wanted access to a crime scene?

32:16.935 --> 32:19.868
The press are allowed
closer access to a crime scene

32:20.007 --> 32:21.422
than the general public.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.424
It is acceptable for the press
to enter a crime scene

32:23.562 --> 32:26.945
if and only if they are not
going to disturb the evidence

32:27.083 --> 32:28.394
or endanger themselves.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.845
Let's talk about
the importance

32:30.983 --> 32:32.536
of not disturbing evidence.

32:32.674 --> 32:36.851
Recently, you--you failed
to secure a crime scene.

32:39.405 --> 32:41.856
- I did.
- And?

32:41.994 --> 32:44.583
The sprinklers went off.

32:44.721 --> 32:47.724
Critical evidence was
literally washed away.

32:47.862 --> 32:49.726
I recovered what I could,
and I worked with the DA

32:49.864 --> 32:51.762
to make the case
as strong as possible.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.488
It was my fault.

32:53.626 --> 32:55.352
I accept
full responsibility for that.

32:55.490 --> 32:57.492
But I made the most of it.

32:57.630 --> 33:00.909
It sounds like you're
almost glad you lost evidence.

33:01.048 --> 33:02.981
Of course not.

33:03.119 --> 33:04.430
But I couldn't change it.

33:04.568 --> 33:07.157
And I didn't let it
knock me off my course.

33:07.295 --> 33:10.126
I tracked my suspect,
and I got a full confession.

33:12.335 --> 33:14.026
I learned a lot
from that mistake,

33:14.164 --> 33:16.822
and I will never make it again.

33:34.081 --> 33:37.187
Looks like there's
a few cabins in the east.

33:37.325 --> 33:39.534
All right. Here we go.

33:48.198 --> 33:50.166
Look what you did.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.067
Yeah.

33:55.205 --> 33:57.000
All right.
We gotta find them now.

33:57.138 --> 33:58.519
Which way is east?

33:58.657 --> 34:00.038
Uh, that way.

34:00.176 --> 34:01.901
Let's go.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.251
I came here for peace
and quiet...

34:09.668 --> 34:11.221
To heal.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.129
And you screwed that up.

34:32.173 --> 34:34.072
I was finally gonna be
good-looking.

34:34.210 --> 34:39.077
And hot girls like you...

34:39.215 --> 34:41.424
were finally gonna look my way.

34:41.562 --> 34:43.909
And now they'll--
now they'll just run.

34:45.635 --> 34:46.981
True beauty is on the inside.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.294
Oh. [laughs] Good.

34:49.432 --> 34:52.262
Then you won't mind me cutting
my way inside you to find it?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.539
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:53.677 --> 34:54.851
Look, focus on me.

34:54.989 --> 34:56.128
I'm the one who screwed
everything up for you.

34:56.266 --> 34:57.509
It was me.
- Don't be jealous.

34:57.647 --> 35:00.201
There's plenty of this
to go around, huh?

35:03.411 --> 35:04.895
You're a cop, aren't you?

35:05.033 --> 35:06.173
Yes.

35:06.311 --> 35:07.657
Yes, I am, LAPD.

35:07.795 --> 35:10.246
But us being here has
nothing to do with you.

35:10.384 --> 35:11.557
We're on our honeymoon.

35:11.695 --> 35:12.662
Right!

35:12.800 --> 35:14.284
It's a whole operation.

35:14.422 --> 35:17.598
"It's a"--
Rafael and Elise work here.

35:17.736 --> 35:19.979
What, you--you thought
they were undercover?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.981
- What do you know about me?
- Nothing.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.466
And we wouldn't have
suspected anything

35:23.604 --> 35:24.984
if you'd just left us alone!

35:37.307 --> 35:39.137
You are a liar!

35:39.275 --> 35:41.829
- Shut up!

35:41.967 --> 35:45.212
Or you're gonna end up
as dead as your dad!

35:45.350 --> 35:49.492
By the way, you were smart
to take my ammo,

35:49.630 --> 35:50.976
but you didn't hide it
very well.

35:51.114 --> 35:51.977
No!

35:53.668 --> 35:55.705
Gun.

36:22.352 --> 36:23.940
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

36:24.078 --> 36:25.079
I was so scared.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.356
Get some towels
from the bathroom.

36:26.494 --> 36:27.426
I need to stop her bleeding.
- Right.

36:27.564 --> 36:29.704
- I got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:31.844 --> 36:33.777
It's gonna be OK.

36:34.882 --> 36:36.608
What is--oh, my God.

36:36.746 --> 36:37.919
I believe that's yours.

36:40.336 --> 36:41.578
Who the hell is that?

36:41.716 --> 36:43.891
That's our backup, finally.

36:45.858 --> 36:47.826
Looks like our honeymoon
ends with an airlift.

36:47.964 --> 36:49.345
Thank God.

36:53.141 --> 36:54.315
You did good work
today, Boot.

36:54.453 --> 36:56.386
Paid attention to details,
thought outside the box.

36:56.524 --> 36:57.801
Thank you.

36:57.939 --> 36:59.769
I couldn't have done it
without my training officer.

36:59.907 --> 37:01.080
That's a good answer.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.427
But day's not done yet.

37:02.565 --> 37:04.463
Right, right.

37:04.601 --> 37:06.500
But you know, this could be
a little more manageable

37:06.638 --> 37:08.571
with the help from my TO.

37:08.709 --> 37:10.400
Don't mistake my compliment
for kindness.

37:10.538 --> 37:12.230
Police work isn't
supposed to be manageable.

37:12.368 --> 37:14.404
Good luck.
- Yes, sir.

37:15.681 --> 37:16.613
Ooh.

37:16.751 --> 37:18.063
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:18.201 --> 37:19.823
I heard a guy vomited on you,

37:19.961 --> 37:22.274
and then you booked another guy
who drank his own urine?

37:22.412 --> 37:23.758
Yeah.

37:23.896 --> 37:26.174
You know, I bet you're missing
patrol right about now.

37:26.313 --> 37:27.935
I think I can handle
a few more days

37:28.073 --> 37:31.628
without being covered
in a stranger's bodily fluids.

37:34.769 --> 37:37.116
Today feels less weird
than yesterday, doesn't it?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.428
Yeah.

37:38.566 --> 37:40.810
And maybe tomorrow
will feel even less weird.

37:40.948 --> 37:42.260
That sounds about right.

37:42.398 --> 37:44.469
Good, 'cause I--

37:44.607 --> 37:46.643
I miss my friend.

37:46.781 --> 37:48.369
Me too.

37:48.507 --> 37:51.441
Maybe we can laugh
about this sometime soon--

37:51.579 --> 37:54.168
not, like, today, but soon.

37:57.067 --> 37:57.965
Good night, Celina.

37:58.103 --> 37:59.760
Good night.

38:03.660 --> 38:04.799
Hmm.

38:21.609 --> 38:23.784
Sarge, I'm gonna die
on this list.

38:26.131 --> 38:28.133
Sorry, Chen.

38:47.290 --> 38:48.533
Well, well, well.

38:48.671 --> 38:52.053
The shortest vacation ever.

38:52.191 --> 38:54.918
You get an ID on Nolan
and Bailey's bad guy?

38:55.056 --> 38:57.921
Yep, his real name is
Nicholas Colston.

38:58.059 --> 39:00.027
He has been in the wind
since they found

39:00.165 --> 39:03.513
pieces of his girlfriend
all over his apartment.

39:03.651 --> 39:04.756
He was hiding out
on the island

39:04.894 --> 39:06.585
recovering from facial surgery,

39:06.723 --> 39:08.449
and when he saw a cop
honeymooning next door,

39:08.587 --> 39:09.864
he got paranoid.

39:10.002 --> 39:12.626
He thought his victims were
conducting surveillance.

39:12.764 --> 39:14.213
Glad you got there
when you did.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.388
Well, local law says
that we might have to go

39:16.526 --> 39:19.011
back down to the island
to testify.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.566
Yeah.
Week--maybe two, tops.

39:21.704 --> 39:22.705
Mm.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.537
Yeah.

39:30.333 --> 39:31.541
That's funny.

39:36.581 --> 39:39.238
I can't believe
I came in 17th.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.965
It's almost worse
than coming in last.

39:42.103 --> 39:43.588
Hey, look.

39:43.726 --> 39:46.073
There is definitely no prize
for coming in last.

39:46.211 --> 39:51.527
But I'm pretty sure there's
a prize for coming in 17th.

39:51.665 --> 39:52.838
Oh, my God.

39:52.976 --> 39:55.634
Oh.

39:55.772 --> 39:57.602
I guess I'll just
have to set my sights

39:57.740 --> 40:01.502
on a different future,
like metro.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.057
I'm kidding.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.404
I--I knew that.

40:06.542 --> 40:08.267
