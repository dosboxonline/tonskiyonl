00:23.208 --> 00:27.333
<i>If women realized the utmost significance
of being a mother,</i>

00:28.750 --> 00:32.083
<i>they would carry out the task
with their eyes set on the stars.</i>

00:32.083 --> 00:35.083
BASED ON REAL EVENTS

00:45.583 --> 00:48.541
<i>She was destined to be someone important.</i>

00:50.750 --> 00:53.125
<i>She was supposed
to be the first among all of us.</i>

00:56.458 --> 01:00.791
<i>She came into this world to change it,
but she didn't have the time.</i>

01:03.500 --> 01:05.458
<i>There were three shots.</i>

01:05.458 --> 01:08.833
<i>One to the face, one to the chest,</i>

01:09.708 --> 01:11.541
<i>and a last one to the sex.</i>

01:21.791 --> 01:27.791
THE RED VIRGIN

01:42.333 --> 01:44.916
<i>But Hildegart's story begins
long before that.</i>

01:46.166 --> 01:47.875
<i>When I was still young</i>

01:47.875 --> 01:50.458
<i>and the first treatises on eugenics
arrived in Galicia.</i>

01:52.125 --> 01:56.000
<i>My name is Aurora Rodríguez Carballeira.
I am Hildegart's mother.</i>

01:57.166 --> 01:59.666
<i>Thanks to my intellectual avidity
and my father's fortune,</i>

01:59.666 --> 02:01.041
<i>I had no boundaries growing up.</i>

02:01.041 --> 02:02.541
F. NIETZSCHE
THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

02:03.833 --> 02:06.833
<i>Thus, I learned about the findings
on genetic improvement</i>

02:06.833 --> 02:08.750
<i>and the fight for women's rights.</i>

02:11.625 --> 02:13.916
<i>That's how I understood
that it was us women</i>

02:13.916 --> 02:16.708
<i>who had to shape the future of humanity.</i>

02:25.750 --> 02:29.125
<i>But ideas are powerless
if they aren't put into action.</i>

02:35.416 --> 02:39.541
<i>That is why I decided
to conceive a child myself that would be</i>

02:39.541 --> 02:41.625
<i>solely and exclusively my own.</i>

02:43.416 --> 02:46.541
<i>As a physiological contributor,
I looked for someone</i>

02:46.541 --> 02:48.958
<i>who could never claim it as his.</i>

02:55.416 --> 02:57.833
<i>From my womb, a girl was born.</i>

02:57.833 --> 03:01.333
<i>A eugenic girl, the first free woman.</i>

03:03.208 --> 03:06.833
<i>I would like to point out that Hildegart
did not come to life by chance,</i>

03:07.375 --> 03:11.166
<i>nor by the simple animal desire
of her parents to conceive her,</i>

03:11.958 --> 03:14.833
<i>but as part of a perfectly-designed plan.</i>

03:15.916 --> 03:20.541
<i>She had to be a pure being
who would fight for a decent society.</i>

03:20.541 --> 03:23.125
<i>She had to be the woman of the future.</i>

03:27.208 --> 03:28.958
<i>She started talking at eight months old.</i>

03:28.958 --> 03:32.750
<i>By the time she was two, she could read.</i>

03:32.750 --> 03:34.541
<i>At three, she could write.</i>

03:34.541 --> 03:37.375
<i>At four, she was a certified typist.</i>

03:37.375 --> 03:38.875
Seven o'clock. Get up.

03:38.875 --> 03:42.083
<i>She was raised
according to strict eugenic parameters.</i>

03:42.083 --> 03:43.875
<i>She'd always wake up at the same time.</i>

03:43.875 --> 03:44.791
Get up.

03:44.791 --> 03:48.041
<i>Every minute of her life
was organized according to a plan.</i>

03:48.583 --> 03:51.791
<i>Her nutrition and hygiene
observed strict rules.</i>

03:51.791 --> 03:54.083
<i>She would always have
fruit and milk for breakfast.</i>

03:54.083 --> 03:55.250
<i>Her dinners were light.</i>

03:55.250 --> 03:58.708
<i>In order to improve
her competitiveness and endurance,</i>

03:58.708 --> 04:00.250
<i>she would practice sports.</i>

04:00.250 --> 04:02.625
<i>At eight years old,
she could speak six languages.</i>

04:02.625 --> 04:05.250
<i>She was fluent
in French, English, and Latin.</i>

04:05.250 --> 04:07.916
<i>And she could translate
from German, Portuguese, and Italian.</i>

04:07.916 --> 04:09.625
What is eugenics?

04:10.166 --> 04:13.875
Eugenics is the application
of the biological laws of heredity,

04:13.875 --> 04:15.500
that is to say, genetics,

04:15.500 --> 04:19.166
<i>in order to perfect
the human species and society.</i>

04:19.166 --> 04:23.500
<i>At 14, she began studying medicine,
law and philosophy at the university.</i>

04:23.500 --> 04:27.958
<i>At 17, with honors,
she became Spain's youngest lawyer.</i>

04:27.958 --> 04:31.250
<i>Hegel believed that,
as much as the capacity for freedom</i>

04:31.250 --> 04:35.708
is a potential characteristic
in every member of the human species,

04:35.708 --> 04:38.416
the state of being free
is an achievement of a different sort.

04:39.416 --> 04:41.041
Seven o'clock. Get up.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.458
<i>How do we differentiate...</i>

04:44.041 --> 04:46.708
the male from the female?

04:46.708 --> 04:49.166
Careful, don't push the pen too hard
because, you see?

04:49.166 --> 04:51.375
<i>She would study
for five hours in the morning,</i>

04:51.375 --> 04:53.250
<i>read for three hours in the afternoon,</i>

04:53.250 --> 04:55.333
<i>and we would debate the arts
before bath time.</i>

04:55.333 --> 04:56.833
Stop. That's enough.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.958
What's the center of Nietzschean thought?

05:00.958 --> 05:04.000
It's not coming off. That God is dead.

05:05.041 --> 05:08.208
<i>And that we're
the ultimate makers of society.</i>

05:08.208 --> 05:09.416
Focus.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.000
<i>So?</i>

05:11.000 --> 05:13.333
- Was Nietzsche pre-existentialist?
- No.

05:13.333 --> 05:16.791
Nietzsche said
one has to have chaos in oneself

05:16.791 --> 05:18.750
to give birth to a shooting star.

05:19.250 --> 05:23.250
<i>My mother married me off
My mother married me off</i>

05:23.250 --> 05:25.583
<i>I was young and beautiful</i>

05:26.666 --> 05:27.666
Again.

05:28.916 --> 05:30.333
And sit at the table.

05:35.916 --> 05:38.416
<i>I raised and educated her
through the years.</i>

05:40.500 --> 05:42.750
<i>I knew perfectly well
how far she had to go.</i>

05:42.750 --> 05:45.166
One, two, three, four.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.666
One, two, three, four.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.416
One, two, three, four.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.291
Mom, where is my father?

05:59.583 --> 06:01.625
You don't have a father, child.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.416
That's why we are free.

06:04.708 --> 06:08.333
<i>"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more.</i>

06:09.291 --> 06:11.916
"Men were deceivers ever.

06:11.916 --> 06:15.625
"One foot in sea, and one on shore,

06:16.125 --> 06:18.416
"to one thing constant never.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.083
"Then sigh not so,

06:22.625 --> 06:24.416
"but let them go.

06:24.708 --> 06:26.666
"And be you blithe and bonny.

06:26.666 --> 06:29.166
"Converting all your sounds of woe

06:29.166 --> 06:31.625
"into hey nonny, nonny."

06:46.250 --> 06:47.458
Excuse me.

06:50.208 --> 06:53.041
Excuse me.
Mr. Guzmán can't see you right now.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.333
- We've been waiting.
- The monarchy has just fallen.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.750
- Today is not an easy day, Mrs...
- Rodríguez.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.583
This is my daughter, Hildegart Rodríguez.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.875
I can give you an appointment
for two weeks from now.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.250
Come back then.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.291
The exit is that way, thank you.

07:11.958 --> 07:12.875
Madam.

07:13.708 --> 07:14.750
Madam!

07:14.750 --> 07:17.375
You can't go upstairs without permission!

07:18.166 --> 07:19.750
Madam, are you listening to me?

07:21.583 --> 07:23.541
Madam, you can't go in there.

07:23.541 --> 07:24.541
Madam!

07:25.750 --> 07:27.708
Please don't let them in.
Don't let them in!

07:27.708 --> 07:29.291
Madam! Open this door immediately.

07:29.291 --> 07:30.875
THE MONARCHY

07:32.166 --> 07:34.333
May I know why
you don't want my daughter's essays?

07:34.333 --> 07:36.583
It is much better
than what you usually publish.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.500
Who are you?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.833
I am Aurora Rodríguez,
mother of Hildegart Rodríguez,

07:39.833 --> 07:43.208
the author of the text <i>The Sexual Problem
Addressed by a Spanish Woman.</i>

07:43.208 --> 07:45.375
- Madam!
- The Republic has just been proclaimed.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.625
I have other priorities.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.125
Our letter predates the king's abdication.

07:49.666 --> 07:51.166
- Dolores!
- Madam!

07:52.000 --> 07:54.125
I am not asking you to publish it now.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.458
The timing is up to you,

07:56.458 --> 07:59.166
but when a regime falls,
a new one must be built.

08:00.541 --> 08:03.000
I would gladly publish the article.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.791
But I cannot do so
with your daughter's name on it.

08:06.791 --> 08:07.875
Why not?

08:08.666 --> 08:11.416
I usually publish
the legitimate author's name.

08:11.416 --> 08:13.500
What makes you think it is not hers?

08:14.708 --> 08:16.458
How old are you, child?

08:17.291 --> 08:18.416
Sixteen.

08:18.416 --> 08:21.583
No 16-year-old woman can write this.

08:21.583 --> 08:24.208
Hildegart can, and she is 16 years old.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.833
I know you wrote it, Mrs. Rodríguez.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.041
You could sign the article
and settle the matter.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.625
I don't like it
when people try to fool me.

08:32.625 --> 08:33.625
Dolores, please!

08:33.625 --> 08:36.208
Guzmán, they locked it from the inside!

08:36.208 --> 08:39.208
Ask her anything you want.
Regarding the article or the topic.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.583
You want me to talk about sexuality
with your daughter?

08:51.416 --> 08:53.333
Ask her whatever you need to know

08:53.333 --> 08:56.375
to confirm that she is the author
of the article you refuse to publish.

08:57.416 --> 08:58.458
Very well.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.583
What is sexual reform, miss?

09:05.500 --> 09:08.708
In an abstract scope, it is no more
than a proposal for the modernization

09:08.708 --> 09:11.083
of the sexual and love life
of human beings.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.708
However, if you are asking me
about the League

09:13.708 --> 09:15.708
spearheaded by Mr. Havelock Ellis,

09:15.708 --> 09:18.458
I can quote some of the bullet points
of his program for you.

09:20.916 --> 09:21.791
Go ahead.

09:22.541 --> 09:24.583
Equal rights for men and women,

09:24.583 --> 09:27.375
liberation of marital relationships
from the Church,

09:27.375 --> 09:29.375
responsible procreation,

09:29.375 --> 09:32.833
conscious access to birth control
for the proletariat,

09:32.833 --> 09:35.083
protection of unmarried mothers,

09:35.083 --> 09:38.083
understanding of intersex variants.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.500
Should I keep going?

09:40.791 --> 09:43.125
You could have memorized all of that.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.125
Would you question it if she were a man?

09:45.125 --> 09:46.666
Or would you be delighted

09:46.666 --> 09:49.666
to publish and discover
the child prodigy of your time?

09:49.666 --> 09:52.791
Is prodigy somehow exclusive
to the male gender?

09:54.083 --> 09:56.250
In the sexual reform I talk about
in my article,

09:56.250 --> 09:58.416
I reflect, among other topics, on this.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.208
Excuse my boldness, miss,

10:02.208 --> 10:04.916
but what could you possibly know
about female sexuality?

10:04.916 --> 10:06.166
You are a child.

10:06.708 --> 10:09.708
I would dare to say
I know more than you do, Mr. Guzmán.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.083
Despite my lack of experience.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.750
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live!

10:29.416 --> 10:31.583
Long live the Spanish Republic!

10:35.708 --> 10:37.500
Long live Spain!

10:37.500 --> 10:39.625
Down with the monarchy!

10:42.208 --> 10:45.291
- Long live the Spanish Republic!
- Long live the Republic!

10:46.125 --> 10:48.708
- Son of a bitch!
- Hildegart, stay close.

10:48.708 --> 10:49.875
Long live the king!

10:53.625 --> 10:54.708
Hildegart!

10:54.708 --> 10:59.083
Workers to power! Workers to power!

11:00.583 --> 11:01.708
Look at the camera!

11:04.083 --> 11:06.458
Spain is not Catholic anymore!

11:06.458 --> 11:09.583
Why didn't you let Guzmán answer
the question about the prodigy child?

11:11.916 --> 11:14.041
Hildegart! Hildegart!

11:18.666 --> 11:21.583
We are above provocations,
never forget that.

11:21.583 --> 11:25.625
You got carried away with Guzmán,
and we can't get carried away.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.416
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live the Republic!

11:28.958 --> 11:29.916
Long live!

11:32.833 --> 11:36.333
Freedom! Freedom!

11:36.333 --> 11:37.875
Long live the Republic!

11:37.875 --> 11:45.375
The people will never be defeated!

11:52.708 --> 11:53.916
What's the problem?

11:53.916 --> 11:55.666
Where did you come from, you scoundrel?

11:55.666 --> 11:57.041
The parable you establish

11:57.041 --> 12:00.166
between the sexual emancipation of women
and love is precarious.

12:03.291 --> 12:06.958
The reader needs simple parables
to understand complex concepts.

12:07.625 --> 12:11.416
Simplicity may be a virtue,
but intellectual scarcity is a mistake.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.000
Okay.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.250
Strawberries!

12:21.916 --> 12:23.958
Madam. You'll ruin your dress.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.375
Do you want some, Mother?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.458
Don't call me "madam."

12:28.458 --> 12:30.458
Now that you're famous, I have to.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.041
At the bakery
they say you're very important.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.750
They said that?

12:35.750 --> 12:39.125
Well, they don't really read, you know.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.333
But everyone wants to know

12:40.333 --> 12:42.708
about the young female lawyer
who writes about sex.

12:46.291 --> 12:47.541
Go check.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.375
Get back to work.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.208
Madam!

12:58.541 --> 12:59.958
Alpha.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.208
Alpha, come.

13:08.958 --> 13:09.958
I saw you.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.041
Illiterate cowards.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.791
A well-read woman
is more powerful than a witch.

13:17.791 --> 13:19.291
GET A MAN
FUCKING WITCHES

13:19.291 --> 13:20.958
I don't like this one bit, Aurora.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.208
I don't mean to insist,
but you know that, if you want,

13:24.208 --> 13:26.500
I can get you something
to defend yourself with.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.000
Something like what?

13:28.458 --> 13:29.541
A gun?

13:30.541 --> 13:32.750
You know how I feel about guns.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.000
They won't intimidate us with paint.

13:37.666 --> 13:38.666
Come on.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.250
Look.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.000
A mix of aggressiveness and strategy.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.416
They should be ashamed.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.791
Look how they're dressed.

14:05.791 --> 14:07.750
- In black.
- Yes, that's her.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.416
You're missing the match.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.791
Why can't we dress like everyone else?

14:16.208 --> 14:18.250
A woman is free
only when she frees herself

14:18.250 --> 14:20.083
of all external opinions and judgements.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.375
But I want to look pretty.

14:29.666 --> 14:32.083
Would you risk your looks
overriding your intellect?

14:33.833 --> 14:36.041
Would you accept to being seen
as just that?

14:37.166 --> 14:38.166
No.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.875
Thank you.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.166
Excuse me, sir.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.291
Thank you.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.291
Excuse me, Miss.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.375
Do you know him?

14:49.875 --> 14:51.291
Excuse me, sir, do you mind?

14:52.625 --> 14:53.666
Good morning.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.333
Hildegart Rodríguez, right?

14:56.833 --> 14:58.166
It is an honor.

14:58.166 --> 15:01.125
And you must be her mother,
Mrs. Rodríguez Carballeira.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.583
A pleasure to meet you, madam.
Abel Velilla.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.916
Abel Velilla, nice to meet you.

15:06.916 --> 15:10.666
I tried to find you through the newspaper,
but Guzmán wouldn't give me your address.

15:10.666 --> 15:12.208
He has orders not to.

15:13.958 --> 15:15.166
I understand.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.416
I recognized you
from the picture in the articles.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.916
I'm with the Socialist Youth.
I represent my colleagues.

15:21.916 --> 15:24.750
We'd like to invite you
to some of the party meetings.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.750
We've read all of your articles

15:27.750 --> 15:30.250
and we're convinced
that we can work together.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.416
We appreciate the offer.

15:33.458 --> 15:34.666
- Mr...
- Velilla.

15:34.666 --> 15:35.583
Velilla.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.333
But Hildegart is a scholar.

15:39.666 --> 15:40.916
And you are a politician.

15:43.708 --> 15:45.833
I'm only asking her
to come to one meeting.

15:47.625 --> 15:48.500
Just one.

15:53.708 --> 15:57.375
<i>Point, set, and game for Lilí Álvarez.</i>

15:59.791 --> 16:00.833
Shall we?

16:02.916 --> 16:04.458
Think about it.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.166
I'm running out of ink.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.333
Mother, could you bring me a new ribbon?

16:32.458 --> 16:33.416
Mother.

17:47.583 --> 17:50.500
PEPE AND AURORA 1908

17:53.125 --> 17:54.500
What are you doing here?

17:56.166 --> 17:59.208
If your mother catches you
going through her stuff, she'll kill you.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.916
First you, and then me.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.583
Who is this?

18:06.458 --> 18:09.250
Pepe, and it's none of your business.
Go back to the kitchen.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.625
You're going to get us both in trouble.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.916
This is the labia minora.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.041
And up here is the clitoris.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.625
I think we should accept
Abel Velilla's offer.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.958
This is the key element
to female sexual excitement.

18:35.541 --> 18:36.833
Do you see?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.000
We don't need anyone.

18:42.666 --> 18:43.916
It's not an offer.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.750
If it was an offer,
both parties would benefit.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.416
They want to take advantage of us.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.125
THE FREEDOM TO LOVE OFFERS

19:10.000 --> 19:11.166
Aurora.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.541
How much does that gun cost?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.916
Fifteen reales.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.083
But I think I can get it cheaper.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.208
Not a word of this to Hildegart.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.083
Don't bother cleaning it.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.166
WITCHES END UP AT THE STAKE

19:56.583 --> 19:57.791
How do you know?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.083
That they want to take advantage of us.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.541
How do you know?

20:07.083 --> 20:09.625
Because that's what politics
does to thinking.

20:10.916 --> 20:15.166
But ideas are useless
if they're not applied to people's lives.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.083
Isn't that what we want?

20:17.500 --> 20:19.000
To change things?

20:19.375 --> 20:21.291
That's not what we want.

20:21.291 --> 20:22.958
That's what we're going to do.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.458
But they don't know that yet.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.583
They're men. And politicians.

20:28.583 --> 20:31.041
All the more reason to go to that meeting.

20:31.041 --> 20:34.250
We need to be the ones
defending our ideas.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.958
Without middlemen.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.750
- Hello!
- Macarena.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.166
I'm here.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.916
I'll tell her to prepare dinner.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.041
Mother!

20:50.541 --> 20:52.500
The monarchy has just fallen.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.208
It's now or never.

20:55.666 --> 20:57.541
All in due time.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.416
Do you have it?

21:11.125 --> 21:12.291
It's right there.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.791
Was it Antonio?

21:25.500 --> 21:28.083
He wouldn't give it to me,
but I took it anyway.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.000
You need it more.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.041
You can stay the night.

21:36.708 --> 21:40.333
I'm sorry, Macarena,
I didn't mean to cause trouble for you.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.333
You don't understand, Aurora.

21:43.833 --> 21:46.541
Antonio is a good man,
but anarchism got to his head.

21:46.541 --> 21:50.375
- The problem is not the ideas, it's them.
- That's why we need to get involved.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.875
- We already do, with our writing.
- Many women can't read.

21:55.291 --> 21:56.583
Go get the alcohol.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.750
Get the alcohol.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.666
Right, just like our comrade said.

22:08.666 --> 22:12.583
Of course these elections are
an opportunity to regenerate Spain.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.833
To give it back to the working class,

22:14.833 --> 22:17.750
those who plow the land,
those who fill the factories.

22:17.750 --> 22:22.458
The Socialist Party must win
these elections, comrades.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.625
And the Socialist Party
is obligated to lead a change.

22:26.625 --> 22:31.000
A change into a society
based on the principles of revolution.

22:32.958 --> 22:35.750
Comrade Ocaña said the other day,
"We must defend our homeland."

22:35.750 --> 22:39.791
And I say, to defend our homeland,
we need a healthy proletariat.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.458
Because real patriotism

22:41.458 --> 22:44.583
starts by developing
a national industry and economy...

22:44.583 --> 22:46.916
Good afternoon. Welcome.

22:47.416 --> 22:49.208
I'm glad you came.

22:49.208 --> 22:51.791
Hildegart can talk
as soon as comrade Miguel is done.

22:51.791 --> 22:54.208
Hildegart is not here to talk,
she is here to listen.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.458
- Long live the Socialist Party!
- Long live!

22:56.458 --> 22:59.291
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live!

22:59.291 --> 23:01.041
I'd really like to talk.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.166
They don't know
that we're nothing like them.

23:03.166 --> 23:06.250
We have proven
that if they maintain their purposes,

23:06.250 --> 23:07.833
they will stumble upon a fence,

23:07.833 --> 23:09.208
- offered by...
- Miguel!

23:09.208 --> 23:12.041
Yes... Gentlemen, comrades,

23:12.041 --> 23:14.500
we have a very special guest.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.500
Comrade Hildegart,
we'd like to hear from you.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.333
We are honored to have you here.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.041
Be impeccable with your words.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.541
May I?

23:41.833 --> 23:43.083
Thank you.

23:48.541 --> 23:52.500
Gentlemen,
the young prodigy, Hildegart Rodríguez.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.875
Good afternoon.

24:12.416 --> 24:14.458
Thank you for giving me the floor.

24:14.458 --> 24:16.833
Your comrade Abel Velilla
invited my mother and me

24:16.833 --> 24:18.750
to take part in this meeting.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.333
After discussing it, we decided to attend.

24:25.041 --> 24:26.416
It seemed like a good opportunity

24:26.416 --> 24:29.833
to contribute our point of view
in the debates of a party

24:29.833 --> 24:34.833
that, despite boasting of seeking equality
among all members of this society,

24:34.833 --> 24:37.666
has systematically and shamelessly ignored

24:37.666 --> 24:40.291
half of the population of this country:

24:41.458 --> 24:42.875
women.

24:45.625 --> 24:49.166
- Long live the Socialist Party!
- Long live!

25:00.416 --> 25:03.833
We know that the class struggle
is the main driving force.

25:03.833 --> 25:06.083
That is why today
I will talk about something

25:06.083 --> 25:08.083
you've decided to ignore in this fight.

25:11.583 --> 25:14.291
ANOTHER WOMAN IS ASSAULTED
AND RAPED IN CHAMBERÍ

25:14.875 --> 25:17.083
This is news from today's paper.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.291
Eight victims so far this month.

25:21.208 --> 25:25.291
They break into their houses to rob them
and, while they're at it, they rape them.

25:26.041 --> 25:27.958
Thousands of women are raped.

25:27.958 --> 25:30.500
Thousands of women die during labor.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.375
Thousands of women are beaten up daily.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.375
We all live on high alert.

25:39.541 --> 25:42.958
Nonetheless, when I read
the records of your meetings,

25:42.958 --> 25:45.625
there is no trace at all
of this happening.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.250
Not a single reflection.

25:50.708 --> 25:51.833
Why?

25:52.416 --> 25:54.666
Is it because we are invisible?

25:56.666 --> 25:58.541
Or because you don't care about us?

26:03.625 --> 26:04.916
Look at this room.

26:05.750 --> 26:06.666
Look at it.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.000
There are over 70 men and only 2 women.

26:13.625 --> 26:16.708
But it is a pleasure
to have me here today.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.833
Why?

26:27.708 --> 26:30.958
Why am I the only woman
worthy of your respect?

26:31.416 --> 26:33.916
Has anyone ever wondered
why the Spanish woman

26:33.916 --> 26:36.375
is 20 centuries behind the times?

26:36.875 --> 26:40.666
If Spanish women had sufficient insight

26:40.666 --> 26:42.666
into the universal panorama,

26:44.875 --> 26:47.750
they would feel a deep-seated shame

26:48.666 --> 26:50.166
that they do not deserve.

26:53.208 --> 26:56.916
If you want a freer and fairer Spain,

26:56.916 --> 27:01.291
start by making this space
a freer and fairer place.

27:02.166 --> 27:06.166
Revolutions are made
when the people are free and prepared,

27:06.833 --> 27:11.625
not when hunger, pain and rage...

27:14.291 --> 27:17.208
have led them
to a state of irresponsibility.

27:34.541 --> 27:35.541
Good?

27:44.875 --> 27:47.083
Next time don't get caught up
in newspaper stories.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.000
Hildegart!

27:48.000 --> 27:49.875
Will you come to the next meeting?

27:51.083 --> 27:52.875
There aren't enough women.

27:53.791 --> 27:55.958
- What if I can get more to come...
- Thank you.

27:55.958 --> 27:58.333
But there is still
a lot of work to be done.

27:58.875 --> 28:00.708
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

28:01.458 --> 28:02.375
Shall we?

28:02.375 --> 28:03.625
Thank you for coming.

28:05.958 --> 28:07.583
I insist, don't get caught up.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.750
Go straight to inequality.

28:13.250 --> 28:16.625
"Not many women are able
to conceive true mutual

28:16.625 --> 28:18.833
"and unrestricted freedom for both sex..."

28:18.833 --> 28:20.625
Do you really have to do that now?

28:20.625 --> 28:22.708
Do you want to have dinner or not?

28:22.708 --> 28:24.875
Don't get distracted.
What else does it say?

28:24.875 --> 28:28.208
"But even less men are able to accept it,

28:28.208 --> 28:30.458
"whether they are reactionary
or advanced."

28:36.333 --> 28:37.416
Macarena.

28:39.708 --> 28:41.166
Who's Pepe?

28:42.208 --> 28:44.833
Why does my mother have
a hidden photo of him?

28:48.375 --> 28:49.583
Please.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.083
She's asleep.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.958
Pepe is the only man
your mother has ever truly loved.

28:59.958 --> 29:01.125
And where is he?

29:01.125 --> 29:02.500
He's her sister's son,

29:02.500 --> 29:04.208
but your mother raised him.

29:05.083 --> 29:08.208
And your mother, you know her,
made a piano prodigy out of the child.

29:08.208 --> 29:10.875
At only four years old,
he played piano at the Court.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.791
But your aunt, who's very astute,

29:13.416 --> 29:15.458
found out that she could make
money off of him

29:15.458 --> 29:16.875
and took him away.

29:16.875 --> 29:19.375
And your mother never saw him again.

29:21.041 --> 29:22.958
Come on, read something easier for me.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.458
Easier?

29:25.583 --> 29:27.666
Aren't you interested in women's freedom?

29:27.666 --> 29:31.083
I'm interested in freedom,
but you're making me feel dumb.

29:32.208 --> 29:33.166
Look.

29:38.291 --> 29:39.541
TOGETHER
ETERNALLY

29:43.416 --> 29:45.083
A romantic novel.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.500
A co-worker from the factory
gave it to me.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.375
I'm trying, but I'm having a hard time.
Will you read it for me?

29:54.291 --> 29:57.541
"He stared at her and whispered,

29:58.625 --> 30:01.583
"'In my solitudes
I feel hunger and thirst.

30:01.583 --> 30:03.666
"'The hunger of having you by my side...'"

30:03.666 --> 30:06.125
If you're going to laugh at me, forget it.

30:06.583 --> 30:10.166
Although you might like
a little bit of romance, wouldn't you?

30:10.875 --> 30:12.000
Give me that.

30:13.666 --> 30:17.333
"'...of your kisses, your gaze...'"

30:17.333 --> 30:20.708
I don't know if this is the kind of book
that will liberate women.

30:20.708 --> 30:21.708
Well, I love it.

30:25.333 --> 30:26.583
What's wrong?

30:28.375 --> 30:29.708
How about that.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.333
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm almost ready.

30:37.708 --> 30:40.541
- Can't you do it faster?
- I'm doing the best I can.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.583
If my mother finds out,
she won't let me go.

30:43.583 --> 30:45.541
- Hurry up.
- Just finishing up the last notes.

30:45.541 --> 30:46.541
I won't take long.

30:46.541 --> 30:47.708
Macarena!

30:48.416 --> 30:50.916
Why would you want
to attend the meeting on your period?

30:50.916 --> 30:52.500
Women from the countryside do it.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.791
Women from the countryside
bleed in the countryside, not at meetings.

30:55.791 --> 30:58.041
Politics are like wheat,
Macarena, it can't wait.

30:58.041 --> 31:00.833
- What if the cloth gets soaked?
- I'll throw it out and change it.

31:00.833 --> 31:03.750
How can you throw the cloth out
like it's any old thing?

31:04.625 --> 31:08.000
Hurry up. I don't want them to say
women aren't punctual.

31:10.416 --> 31:11.625
Thank you.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.125
Right, but he asked
that we be denied the vote.

31:19.125 --> 31:21.416
They like to see women fight each other.

31:21.416 --> 31:22.958
Shouldn't we vote?

31:23.583 --> 31:26.250
He didn't ask to deny it,
but to postpone it.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.583
But I agree with Campoamor...

31:27.583 --> 31:31.041
You did it. Everyone looks at her
as if she were a miracle out of nowhere.

31:31.041 --> 31:33.125
But I recognize you in her.

31:34.333 --> 31:35.791
Hildegart goes far beyond me.

31:35.791 --> 31:37.208
Thank you, comrades.

31:42.208 --> 31:43.583
I'm going to the restroom.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.166
Where are you going?
This is the men's restroom.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.375
Excuse me, sir, but it's really urgent.

31:54.375 --> 31:55.833
Are you a man?

31:55.833 --> 31:58.125
- I can't find the women's restroom.
- There isn't one.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.375
You'll have to go home.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.166
- Ramón.
- What is it?

32:02.125 --> 32:03.916
Fucking kid.

32:34.333 --> 32:35.541
Hildegart.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.958
I never would've thought I'd see you here.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.666
Have you noticed
that more and more women are coming?

32:46.125 --> 32:48.416
We'll have to build a restroom for them.

32:53.208 --> 32:54.166
Here.

32:54.583 --> 32:55.833
Thank you.

32:55.833 --> 32:57.958
I have to go, my mother is waiting for me.

32:57.958 --> 33:00.041
You could write an essay on the subject.

33:01.041 --> 33:02.125
What subject?

33:02.708 --> 33:03.833
The restroom.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.375
There's no women's restroom,
that could work as a metaphor.

33:07.375 --> 33:09.583
My first essay
is already at the printing press.

33:10.416 --> 33:11.625
What's the title?

33:12.833 --> 33:14.125
<i>Sex and Love.</i>

33:17.500 --> 33:18.750
I'll have to read it.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.625
- Well...
- Hey, your name, where does it come from?

33:23.625 --> 33:24.791
Hildegart.

33:26.041 --> 33:28.416
My mother says it means
"garden of knowledge."

33:29.333 --> 33:31.375
-"Garden of knowledge."
- But it doesn't.

33:31.375 --> 33:34.291
In Old German, <i>"hil"</i> means "battle"
and <i>"gart"</i> means "garden."

33:34.291 --> 33:36.041
It would be "battle garden."

33:38.250 --> 33:39.750
But let's not tell her that.

33:41.708 --> 33:43.041
We won't.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.666
I really have to go.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.708
Hey, will you come to the next meeting?

33:51.458 --> 33:52.458
Yes.

33:55.541 --> 33:58.000
SEX AND LOVE
HILDEGART

34:00.208 --> 34:02.250
Give me your hand. Come on.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.166
Spin!

34:03.916 --> 34:05.583
Faster, faster!

34:05.583 --> 34:06.750
Okay, okay...

34:08.041 --> 34:10.958
Alpha!

34:10.958 --> 34:13.708
- We did it! Are you happy?
- What are you reading?

34:13.708 --> 34:15.416
Macarena, dance!

34:16.333 --> 34:17.958
- Miss, come on.
- Dance, Macarena.

34:17.958 --> 34:20.125
- I'll get dizzy.
-"She went silent in an instant,

34:20.125 --> 34:23.208
"and that's when he kissed her softly."

34:27.416 --> 34:30.000
It certainly can't be
for the quality of its prose.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.666
It's a melodramatic novel.

34:35.416 --> 34:39.041
I'm interested in seeing how love
is depicted in mass-consumed fiction.

34:39.750 --> 34:42.291
These melodramatic novels
aren't indicative of anything.

34:42.291 --> 34:44.208
They don't reflect real life.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.125
Only unfulfilled desires.

34:48.791 --> 34:50.708
Desire is interesting, Mother.

34:52.583 --> 34:54.333
Haven't you ever desired anyone?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.416
I fell in love once.

34:58.583 --> 34:59.791
With a captain.

35:01.791 --> 35:03.416
Long before you were born.

35:03.833 --> 35:05.625
We almost got married.

35:05.625 --> 35:06.958
And what happened?

35:08.250 --> 35:12.000
- I wanted to be free, and he...
- He wouldn't have allowed it.

35:12.958 --> 35:14.625
He would've wanted to be your father.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.625
Did you ever regret it?

35:21.208 --> 35:22.500
Regret what?

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
Love and revolution are incompatible.

35:36.916 --> 35:40.291
Macarena says that the only man
you've ever loved was a child.

35:41.625 --> 35:42.875
Pepe.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.708
It seems to me
that Macarena talks too much.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.333
Why haven't you told me about him?

36:01.416 --> 36:03.375
Forget these melodramatic novels.

36:03.375 --> 36:06.333
All fiction is,
by definition, conservative.

36:19.250 --> 36:21.125
Why do we have a gun in the house?

36:32.750 --> 36:34.250
Mr. Guzmán.

36:41.458 --> 36:43.250
Do you always greet visitors like that?

36:43.250 --> 36:45.208
We don't usually have visitors.

36:45.208 --> 36:47.958
I think you are the first man
to set foot in this house.

36:48.541 --> 36:50.666
All right, a toast to Hildegart.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.291
We don't drink champagne.

37:00.375 --> 37:03.041
I just wanted to give you
the good news in person.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.000
Everyone wants a copy of <i>Sex and Love.</i>

37:05.000 --> 37:06.583
They're running out.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.625
And the second edition
is already underway.

37:08.625 --> 37:12.500
I am here to make a first payment
for this edition.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.625
With that money
you could have the hall painted.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.125
We like it just the way it is.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.958
What is the amount?

37:20.958 --> 37:22.958
793 pesetas.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.625
- Whom should I write it out to?
- To me.

37:26.708 --> 37:28.750
Aurora Rodríguez Carballeira.

37:30.458 --> 37:32.416
I need a man's name.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.875
You won't be able
to cash this check yourself.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.541
Perhaps we could use
the name of Hildegart's father.

37:40.333 --> 37:41.875
Hildegart doesn't have a father.

37:44.333 --> 37:47.000
In that case,
I can give you the money myself.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.125
Very well.
I will have Macarena go and collect it.

37:50.125 --> 37:53.083
- I can come myself and hand it to you.
- That won't be necessary.

37:53.083 --> 37:54.375
Thank you.

37:54.958 --> 37:56.083
All right, well...

37:56.083 --> 37:58.875
When it is ready, I will let you know.

37:58.875 --> 37:59.958
Very well.

38:04.791 --> 38:07.666
I also wanted to tell you
that I've been contacted

38:07.666 --> 38:10.458
to have <i>Sex and Love</i>
translated and published in England.

38:10.458 --> 38:12.625
- By whom?
- Havelock Ellis.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.250
- Dr. Havelock Ellis?
- Yes.

38:15.250 --> 38:18.833
He hasn't made an offer yet, but he wants
to meet the author as soon as possible.

38:19.666 --> 38:22.083
And H.G. Wells
wants to write the prologue.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.833
Did you hear that, Mother?

38:23.833 --> 38:25.833
We will consider it
when they make an offer.

38:25.833 --> 38:29.000
But, Mother, Havelock
is the world's pioneer in sexology.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.250
His support would...

38:30.250 --> 38:34.000
Mr. Havelock Ellis and Mr. H.G. Wells
are English imperialists

38:34.000 --> 38:36.291
who only want
to take advantage of our ideas.

38:36.291 --> 38:38.208
I don't think Mr. Wells intends to...

38:38.208 --> 38:40.583
When they make an offer, we'll talk.

38:40.583 --> 38:42.250
- Anything else?
- Yes.

38:44.916 --> 38:47.416
I would like to publish
your next essay, miss.

38:51.291 --> 38:52.666
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.416
- Hello.
- Hi.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.583
Hello.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.916
- Hey! Good.
- How are you?

39:08.291 --> 39:10.708
- Thank you.
- I want it signed, too.

39:12.500 --> 39:15.250
You'll have to wait, they were here first.

39:15.250 --> 39:16.166
Okay.

39:18.416 --> 39:19.500
Welcome.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.250
Thank you.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.541
See anything interesting?

39:36.833 --> 39:37.875
Yes.

39:40.041 --> 39:41.916
But I can't afford them.

39:44.083 --> 39:45.583
Sign it for me?

39:46.541 --> 39:48.250
THE SEXUAL REBELLION OF YOUTH

39:48.250 --> 39:51.291
The important thing about a book
is that its ideas reach people,

39:51.291 --> 39:52.500
not who signs it.

39:54.000 --> 39:54.875
Right.

39:58.458 --> 40:01.250
But I would like to have it signed by you.

40:05.458 --> 40:06.791
Do you have a pen?

40:07.583 --> 40:08.416
Sure.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.583
Excuse me. Am I too late?

40:17.583 --> 40:20.875
I just crossed all of Madrid
to get the books signed.

40:20.875 --> 40:22.666
Did Hildegart leave already?

40:24.833 --> 40:26.208
People only want your signature

40:26.208 --> 40:28.250
so they can resell the book
at a higher price.

40:29.458 --> 40:30.583
Great.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
That way it'll be a bit harder
for you then.

40:36.958 --> 40:39.625
"This book belongs
and will always belong to Abel Velilla.

40:39.625 --> 40:41.833
"I do not authorize it to be sold."

40:42.708 --> 40:44.083
It's all in the books.

40:46.500 --> 40:50.083
Well, I'm not sure it's all in the books,
to tell you the truth.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.250
There is more out there.

40:55.708 --> 40:57.416
You should go out and see it.

40:58.666 --> 40:59.875
With you?

41:01.041 --> 41:03.166
Why did you get into politics,
Mr. Velilla?

41:08.750 --> 41:10.416
To be the voice of the people?

41:10.916 --> 41:12.375
Or to lead them?

41:14.916 --> 41:17.041
I don't think they are mutually exclusive.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.375
Are you sure about that?

41:19.375 --> 41:22.291
I got into politics
to transform society, Mrs. Rodríguez.

41:23.916 --> 41:26.875
Leaders are the voice of the people,
the people choose them freely.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.791
And when both leader and people coincide

41:28.791 --> 41:31.958
on the same revolutionary base
and in time, success is guaranteed.

41:32.833 --> 41:34.166
Hildegart is the example.

41:36.666 --> 41:40.000
She guides the people because
they put her there when they needed her.

41:40.708 --> 41:43.250
- That is the great power of masses.
- You are wrong.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.666
Hildegart is where she is
because I put her there.

41:50.625 --> 41:51.875
Let's go.

42:10.458 --> 42:11.708
How did it go?

42:14.541 --> 42:16.541
I'll help her with her nightgown.

42:28.333 --> 42:30.875
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.000
Hilde...

42:35.875 --> 42:38.000
I'm just tired, that's all.

42:45.416 --> 42:46.500
Who is he?

42:50.958 --> 42:52.041
Who is who?

42:52.041 --> 42:54.541
I've never seen you tired
after a presentation.

43:00.666 --> 43:01.833
Who is he?

43:02.833 --> 43:05.041
- There is no "he."
- Come on!

43:06.250 --> 43:08.750
What is he, a writer? Or a politician?

43:10.333 --> 43:12.083
Did he do anything to you?

43:13.708 --> 43:15.291
No, he didn't do anything to me.

43:15.291 --> 43:16.875
So there is a "he"!

43:19.625 --> 43:20.833
What happened?

43:22.166 --> 43:23.083
What happened?

43:23.083 --> 43:26.416
My mother will never allow
anything to happen. That's what happened.

43:26.958 --> 43:28.583
Your mother is not like that.

43:29.750 --> 43:31.250
What's his name?

43:33.291 --> 43:35.041
- What's his name?
- Abel.

43:35.041 --> 43:36.666
Abel.

43:36.666 --> 43:37.791
Is he handsome?

43:41.416 --> 43:42.291
Macarena,

43:43.041 --> 43:44.416
can you help me?

43:45.041 --> 43:46.541
With what, honey?

43:47.333 --> 43:48.916
I need to see him alone.

43:50.625 --> 43:52.208
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

43:55.958 --> 43:58.625
Don't be sad. We'll find a way.

43:59.541 --> 44:01.291
You can't be any prettier.

44:03.166 --> 44:05.125
Stop! Stop!

44:06.541 --> 44:09.208
Stop! Don't tickle me!

44:09.208 --> 44:12.541
- She's going to hear us.
- Your mother is probably sleeping by now.

44:14.166 --> 44:16.000
I love you so much, Macarena.

44:17.708 --> 44:19.666
Who's the most beautiful thing
in the world?

44:48.875 --> 44:49.750
Gentlemen.

44:52.125 --> 44:53.750
- Welcome.
- Good morning.

44:53.750 --> 44:55.500
- Good morning. How are you?
- Abel.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.958
- How are you doing?
- Mr. Velilla.

45:00.750 --> 45:02.500
Mrs. Rodríguez, what a coincidence.

45:02.916 --> 45:03.916
Let me introduce you.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.125
Julián Besteiro,
president of the Socialist Party.

45:07.125 --> 45:08.541
It is a true pleasure.

45:08.541 --> 45:10.875
- Andrés Saborit.
- Nice to meet you.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.291
And Wenceslao Carrillo.

45:12.291 --> 45:14.500
Madam, your daughter
is truly a political prodigy.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.791
- Sincere congratulations.
- You must choose.

45:16.791 --> 45:18.708
Either you stay away from Hildegart,

45:18.708 --> 45:20.666
or she won't attend
any more party meetings.

45:20.666 --> 45:23.666
- One thing or the other.
- Abel, what is she talking about?

45:23.666 --> 45:27.708
Let's see if your individual interest
is contingent on the collective one.

45:28.291 --> 45:30.083
Gentlemen, good day.

45:30.083 --> 45:31.375
- Good day.
- Good day, madam.

45:34.375 --> 45:35.833
Abel, what just happened here?

45:37.833 --> 45:40.166
Those attacks have nothing to do with us.

45:40.166 --> 45:41.791
Yes, they do.

45:41.791 --> 45:44.708
Or do we not constitute
as this party as well?

45:44.708 --> 45:46.583
It is our responsibility

45:46.583 --> 45:49.541
to condemn those attacks
and pressure the police.

45:49.541 --> 45:52.250
They complain that they're being robbed,

45:52.250 --> 45:54.750
but they'd previously
plundered the people.

45:54.750 --> 45:58.708
You know what? Steal from a thief,
earn a hundred years of forgiveness.

45:58.708 --> 46:00.458
What about raping a woman?

46:00.458 --> 46:03.791
We're not talking about robberies,
robberies aren't the problem.

46:03.791 --> 46:06.333
The problem is
what they're doing to women.

46:06.333 --> 46:10.208
It's an anarchist gang.
The left must remain united.

46:10.208 --> 46:12.500
- I can't believe this.
- That's not anarchism.

46:12.500 --> 46:15.041
Anarchism is
the fight for freedom, remember?

46:15.041 --> 46:17.333
It's the war against authority,
not against women.

46:17.333 --> 46:20.458
If you were the ones being raped,
you wouldn't look the other way.

46:20.458 --> 46:21.958
Here, Ms. Rodríguez.

46:22.875 --> 46:24.541
FEDERAL REPUBLICAN PARTY

46:26.250 --> 46:28.250
You don't think that the time has come

46:28.250 --> 46:31.250
for us to actively take part
in the party's choices either?

46:32.291 --> 46:35.083
Yes, comrade.
We'll take that into account.

46:35.833 --> 46:37.041
This is our time.

46:37.041 --> 46:39.666
- This is our time.
- That's right, this is our time!

46:39.666 --> 46:41.708
Enough. The meeting is adjourned.

46:41.708 --> 46:45.125
Comrades, men and women,
long live the workers' struggle!

46:45.125 --> 46:47.041
- Long live!
- Long live the Socialist Party!

46:47.041 --> 46:48.833
- Long live!
- Long live the Republic!

46:48.833 --> 46:50.000
Long live!

46:59.458 --> 47:03.708
Contraception and the control of progeny
is a good topic for you to lead.

47:03.708 --> 47:07.208
I don't think that talking about deviant
anarchist groups is the right thing.

47:08.166 --> 47:09.666
Your soup, dear.

47:10.125 --> 47:12.458
Let her be, Macarena,
she has a speech tomorrow.

47:12.458 --> 47:14.833
- But she needs to eat.
- Let her be.

47:18.750 --> 47:21.583
Have you heard about
the anarchist group that robs homes?

47:22.708 --> 47:25.833
They won't come here.
They only rob bourgeois homes.

47:26.541 --> 47:28.041
This doesn't look like one to you?

47:28.041 --> 47:30.750
There is a good jewelry box,
a maid, and two women alone.

47:30.750 --> 47:34.083
You two are too well-known
for them to risk a scandal.

47:34.083 --> 47:35.125
Excuse me.

47:45.333 --> 47:48.291
<i>And behind her, a crowd will march,</i>

47:48.291 --> 47:50.916
in which not only men
will be present anymore,

47:50.916 --> 47:53.416
but women as well.

47:53.416 --> 47:57.166
We, who have learned to see,
not merely to look.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.833
By temperament first,

47:59.833 --> 48:04.041
and by the necessity to contribute
to the reformist impetus later,

48:04.041 --> 48:06.541
we have also decided to fight.

48:09.041 --> 48:12.125
Not against men, but alongside them.

48:12.125 --> 48:16.791
In everything that aims to make us all
more free and more capable

48:16.791 --> 48:19.541
of creating a just society.

48:20.041 --> 48:22.958
- Long live the Socialist Party!
- Long live!

48:22.958 --> 48:25.666
- Long live the workers' struggle!
- Long live!

48:26.250 --> 48:30.375
<i>Arise, pariahs of the Earth</i>

48:30.375 --> 48:35.250
<i>Stand up, famished legion</i>

48:35.666 --> 48:40.416
<i>Let's all rise as one</i>

48:40.416 --> 48:44.791
<i>This is the end of oppression</i>

48:44.791 --> 48:49.375
<i>The past must be shattered...</i>

48:49.375 --> 48:53.166
- Congratulations. Thank you so much.
- Congratulations on your speech.

48:53.166 --> 48:55.958
- Sincere congratulations on your speech.
- We are with you.

48:55.958 --> 48:58.625
- Congratulations, comrade.
- Sincere congratulations.

48:59.416 --> 49:01.666
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

49:02.541 --> 49:04.291
Keep it up!

49:04.291 --> 49:05.500
Thank you so much!

49:06.958 --> 49:08.625
Thank you for your words.

49:08.916 --> 49:10.750
- We love you.
- We love you!

49:13.416 --> 49:18.041
<i>The human race</i>

49:18.041 --> 49:22.125
<i>Is the international...</i>

49:46.833 --> 49:48.625
FEDERAL REPUBLICAN PARTY

49:53.708 --> 49:57.958
<i>"This brochure belongs and will always
belong to Hildegart Rodríguez.</i>

49:57.958 --> 50:01.666
<i>"I do not authorize it
to be forgotten. Abel."</i>

50:03.541 --> 50:04.541
Hildegart.

50:08.333 --> 50:10.750
Do you want to dance a waltz
before going to sleep?

50:14.416 --> 50:15.625
Okay.

51:23.875 --> 51:27.291
Havelock made an offer to Guzmán
to translate my essays.

51:27.291 --> 51:28.916
Become aware!

51:40.625 --> 51:43.041
Can we men renounce acquired privileges?

51:52.000 --> 51:54.375
<i>He wants me to go to London
so he can meet me.</i>

51:55.125 --> 51:56.875
<i>Have you ever been there?</i>

51:59.958 --> 52:01.416
<i>I've never crossed the sea.</i>

52:04.875 --> 52:06.875
THE LIMITATION OF PROGENY
SEXUAL EDUCATION

52:06.875 --> 52:08.708
Let me read your new essay.

52:10.291 --> 52:13.583
It's a mistake to describe
sexual organs as private.

52:15.166 --> 52:18.458
<i>They're not any more private
than the rest of our anatomy.</i>

52:21.000 --> 52:23.541
Shouldn't sexuality be a State matter?

52:26.083 --> 52:30.791
<i>Rilke says, "How shall I hold my soul
that it doesn't touch yours?</i>

52:31.541 --> 52:35.500
<i>"How shall I raise it
to other things above you?"</i>

52:42.541 --> 52:44.791
PEPE ARRIOLA IN CONCERT

52:44.791 --> 52:47.916
<i>I was just thinking about a song
my mother would always tell me about.</i>

52:48.916 --> 52:50.583
"I love you because I love you.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.916
<i>"No one is in charge of my loving.</i>

52:52.916 --> 52:55.958
"I love you because I feel it
from the depths of my soul."

52:58.958 --> 53:00.208
<i>After counting the votes,</i>

53:00.208 --> 53:03.125
<i>the Spanish Socialist Workers Party
wins the election.</i>

53:07.166 --> 53:08.333
Bravo!

53:22.166 --> 53:23.666
THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE

53:42.875 --> 53:45.416
We can't fill the earth
with mouths we can't provide for.

53:45.416 --> 53:47.375
Let's fight for a regulated
abortion system.

53:47.375 --> 53:49.875
- No, we can't do that.
- We can, in the long run.

53:49.875 --> 53:52.916
For now, we can make
what today is a reality non-punishable.

53:52.916 --> 53:55.041
When conception
is the result of a violent act.

53:55.041 --> 53:56.958
When there's
a risk of death for the mother.

53:56.958 --> 53:59.833
- When she can't take care of the child.
- We are not a charity.

53:59.833 --> 54:01.666
Abortion, in these cases, is not a crime.

54:08.541 --> 54:09.833
Here...

54:09.833 --> 54:12.708
-"To make non-punishable..."
- Is something wrong, Mother?

54:12.708 --> 54:15.291
"Necessary abortion,
performed to remove the woman

54:15.291 --> 54:16.875
"from life-threatening danger.

54:16.875 --> 54:20.666
"Sentimental abortion, when conception
is the result of a violent act.

54:20.666 --> 54:24.500
"It must be established that abortion,
in these cases, is not a crime."

54:24.500 --> 54:26.500
<i>...is not a crime.</i>

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Mother!

54:57.250 --> 54:58.541
Mother, please!

55:01.291 --> 55:02.291
No.

55:19.375 --> 55:22.041
No!

55:25.958 --> 55:27.458
What's yours is mine.

55:31.875 --> 55:33.250
All of it.

55:36.875 --> 55:38.958
You won't go to the meetings anymore.

55:39.666 --> 55:41.375
You'll write in the mornings.

55:41.833 --> 55:43.708
You'll read in the afternoons.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.916
I will sleep with you at night.

55:45.916 --> 55:47.708
We will eat together.

55:47.708 --> 55:50.125
And I'll go with you to the restroom.

55:52.875 --> 55:55.791
I completely forbid you
from leaving this house.

55:56.416 --> 56:00.125
To get carried away by what you're feeling
is to give in to the animal drive.

56:00.916 --> 56:03.375
And that is our prime enemy.

56:03.375 --> 56:05.875
We've been through a lot
in order to get here.

56:07.375 --> 56:10.583
I won't let one weakness
jeopardize the project.

56:22.833 --> 56:24.666
Love is a weakness.

56:30.833 --> 56:33.083
You were conceived to change the world.

56:35.125 --> 56:38.916
Personal sacrifice
is necessary for the greater good.

56:41.833 --> 56:43.625
We can't fail now.

56:45.375 --> 56:47.250
I raised you better than this.

56:50.625 --> 56:53.833
Guzmán is expecting the final texts
in three weeks.

56:53.833 --> 56:55.333
Don't get distracted.

57:52.458 --> 57:55.625
LA TIERRA - SAME OLD SAME OLD
THE AMBITION OF THE "SOCIAL-NEPOTISTS"

58:45.416 --> 58:47.500
Dear Mr. Havelock Ellis, comma,

58:48.916 --> 58:50.666
I sincerely thank you for your words

58:50.666 --> 58:52.541
and your interest in my essays, period.

58:53.708 --> 58:56.625
I regret to inform you
that Mr. Guzmán and myself

58:56.625 --> 59:01.458
have other plans and commitments
for its international edition, period.

59:01.458 --> 59:04.541
Please convey my apologies to Mr. Wells.

59:05.000 --> 59:05.875
Period.

59:06.250 --> 59:09.625
As for the trip to London,
it would be a pleasure to be able to go,

59:09.625 --> 59:10.833
but much to my regret,

59:10.833 --> 59:14.291
my obligations in Madrid
prevent me from going.

59:16.125 --> 59:17.208
Period.

59:54.375 --> 59:55.791
I'll dress it.

59:55.791 --> 59:57.208
There's no need to.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:05.458
I'll reply to the readers' letters now.

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:06.458
Macarena.

01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:09.250
How many letters arrived today?

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.000
Quite a few. I'll go get them.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.875
You can make concessions to the public,

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.416
as long as that doesn't interfere
with your work.

01:00:22.416 --> 01:00:24.791
There are 16 from fans,

01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:28.916
one from the lyceum,
and this one without sender's information.

01:00:33.416 --> 01:00:34.750
Who is it from?

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:43.750
Don't spend more than an hour
on the letters.

01:00:51.333 --> 01:00:52.500
I'm going out.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.333
I'll be back soon.

01:00:55.333 --> 01:00:57.041
Go to bed after dinner.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.958
Hilde, I made you this.

01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:34.000
Macarena...

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.791
You can't go on a date wearing black.

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:47.375
Thank you!

01:02:27.416 --> 01:02:29.750
- Water?
- What are you having?

01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:31.916
A vermouth.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.208
Would you like one?

01:02:39.208 --> 01:02:40.416
Can we dance?

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:41.250
- What will you have?
- A vermouth.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.833
Two. Thanks.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:49.833
What?

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:54.625
I'm surprised
your mother let you come alone.

01:04:56.916 --> 01:04:58.708
She's not as bad as you think.

01:04:58.708 --> 01:05:00.166
Six reales.

01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:02.625
Thanks.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:05.000
- No, I got it.
- No, I can pay.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.875
- I'm buying today.
- You think I can't pay?

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:13.250
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:05:14.916 --> 01:05:16.166
Just for today.

01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:18.500
Just this time.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.250
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:05:26.875 --> 01:05:29.708
Your first vermouth.
The gap between theory and practice.

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:31.708
Like the socialists.

01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:35.000
They win the election with one program
and then carry out a different one.

01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:40.916
<i>We are not the same, people say</i>

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:50.250
<i>That your life and mine are going to waste</i>

01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:55.750
<i>That I'm a scoundrel...</i>

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.291
This is ideology too.

01:05:57.291 --> 01:05:59.958
<i>And you're decent</i>

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.416
<i>That two different beings</i>

01:06:05.416 --> 01:06:08.875
<i>Cannot love each other</i>

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:14.250
<i>But I already loved you</i>

01:06:15.583 --> 01:06:17.458
<i>And I can't forget you</i>

01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:26.333
<i>And dying in your arms is my dream</i>

01:06:29.833 --> 01:06:35.666
<i>I don't understand those things
about social classes</i>

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.791
<i>I just know that I love you</i>

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:48.250
<i>And that you love me too</i>

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:53.750
<i>Let us go</i>

01:06:56.416 --> 01:07:00.666
<i>Where no one will judge us</i>

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.416
<i>Where no one will tell us</i>

01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:11.000
<i>What we're doing wrong</i>

01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:16.041
<i>Let us go</i>

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.833
<i>Far away from the world</i>

01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:26.708
<i>Where there is no justice</i>

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:29.875
<i>Nor laws, nor anything</i>

01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:32.833
<i>Nothing but our love</i>

01:07:35.791 --> 01:07:37.291
<i>Let us go</i>

01:07:39.666 --> 01:07:43.208
<i>Where no one will judge us</i>

01:07:45.375 --> 01:07:48.541
<i>Where no one will tell us</i>

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:52.333
<i>What we're doing wrong</i>

01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:57.250
<i>Let us go</i>

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:03.500
<i>Far away from the world</i>

01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:11.333
<i>Where there is no justice
Nor laws, nor anything</i>

01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:14.375
<i>Nothing but our love</i>

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.791
<i>We are not the same</i>

01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:23.958
<i>People say</i>

01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:38.250
I don't know. I don't like it.

01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:57.250
Aurora.

01:09:59.958 --> 01:10:01.250
How long has it been?

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:04.166
Eighteen years.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.708
Would you like a drink?

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:10.583
I don't drink.

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.541
Please, have a seat.

01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:17.416
How's your daughter?

01:10:19.625 --> 01:10:22.375
Well, Hildegart is everything
one could've hoped for.

01:10:26.166 --> 01:10:27.958
Yes. She's a prodigy.

01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:30.833
Another one.

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:34.833
Pepe...

01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:50.208
Pepe...

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:53.416
What you did today...

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.875
I taught you better than that.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:07.541
It's not befitting your education, Pepe.

01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:15.083
Why are you here?

01:11:16.166 --> 01:11:18.083
- To humiliate me?
- No.

01:11:26.375 --> 01:11:28.208
You know what they call me in Paris?

01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:39.916
I'm finished, Aurora.

01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:44.000
I'm a fraud.

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:49.000
You're not a fraud.

01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:56.625
No...

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:04.000
If I had stayed with you,
I would be safe right now.

01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:06.125
No.

01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:08.666
Why did you invite me?

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.750
Why did you invite me?

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.583
I didn't invite you.

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:23.291
I didn't want you to see me like this.

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:30.458
Very well.

01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:51.250
How are things going with Havelock Ellis?

01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:57.833
I turned down his offer.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.416
I don't want to go alone.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:06.500
What about your mother?

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:13.708
I could go with you.

01:13:18.416 --> 01:13:19.833
I don't speak English, but...

01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:24.833
Havelock is paying for the tickets.

01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:27.750
Are you seriously proposing this to me?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.583
Would you come with me?

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.875
I'd go anywhere in the world with you.

01:14:03.416 --> 01:14:04.750
I have to go.

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:22.875
Madam, you scared me.

01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:27.791
Are you all right?

01:17:28.833 --> 01:17:30.333
Did he hit you again?

01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:35.291
I'll go make breakfast.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.208
Antonio?

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:22.791
What is it?

01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:24.916
Can we come in?

01:18:58.125 --> 01:18:59.333
Mother?

01:19:03.208 --> 01:19:04.291
Macarena?

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.625
Mother.

01:19:10.416 --> 01:19:11.750
Where were you?

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:13.750
I thought something had happened to you.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.416
- Why didn't you wake me?
- You looked so peaceful...

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.041
I decided to let you sleep.

01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:38.416
I've been thinking.

01:19:40.083 --> 01:19:42.125
Life in this house is going to change.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.291
And in this country.

01:19:45.416 --> 01:19:48.208
So I've invited Abel Velilla over
for dinner next week.

01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:53.541
I cut you off from the world
to make a leader out of you.

01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:56.125
Because the world
needs strong leaders, remember.

01:19:58.125 --> 01:19:59.625
Freud in your sex.

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:02.583
Nietzsche in your chest.

01:20:03.916 --> 01:20:05.375
Marx in your head.

01:20:14.083 --> 01:20:16.125
- Good evening.
- Are you Abel?

01:20:17.208 --> 01:20:19.500
- And you are?
- Macarena.

01:20:20.541 --> 01:20:21.625
Nice to meet you.

01:20:22.541 --> 01:20:24.416
I brought this. My aunt makes them.

01:20:25.416 --> 01:20:27.166
That's very kind of you. Come in.

01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:28.166
Thank you.

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:38.375
Go ahead, make yourself at home.

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:40.583
Thank you, you're very kind.

01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:47.500
It's interesting
how you left the graffiti in the hall.

01:20:49.416 --> 01:20:50.625
A sign of coherence.

01:20:52.333 --> 01:20:54.666
Speaking of coherence. Tell me...

01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:59.416
how is the Socialist Party
going to change?

01:20:59.416 --> 01:21:01.833
As Hildegart denounces,
favoritism within the party

01:21:01.833 --> 01:21:03.625
is a scourge that could be its downfall.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.833
I doubt that the Socialist Party
can change.

01:21:07.708 --> 01:21:10.041
- Unless they throw out...
- I'd like to hear his opinion.

01:21:10.041 --> 01:21:11.500
Could you pour me some water?

01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:16.583
Could you please pour me some water?

01:21:21.416 --> 01:21:23.375
I completely agree with Hildegart.

01:21:24.333 --> 01:21:27.333
The Socialist Party has betrayed
the principles of the labor movement

01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:29.666
and the revolutionary fight,
the fight in the streets,

01:21:29.666 --> 01:21:31.541
in the factories, in the countryside.

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:33.791
All they cared about
was the election strategy.

01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:36.666
As is always the case with politicians.

01:21:39.333 --> 01:21:41.250
I'm considering joining the Federal Party.

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:42.375
So am I.

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:49.375
That's great. With the anarchists.

01:21:50.083 --> 01:21:51.958
They're not anarchists,
they're federalists.

01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:54.375
This country's working class
owes a lot to...

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:55.666
- The door.
- Excuse me, Mrs...

01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:57.958
- If they're not anarchists, what then?
- We need to...

01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:01.125
We need to admit
how much this country's working class

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.958
owes the anarcho-syndicalist movement
and its defense of freedom.

01:22:08.583 --> 01:22:10.291
I'll be damned!

01:22:12.916 --> 01:22:15.416
So you think
that if we break all the structures,

01:22:15.416 --> 01:22:17.000
we'll feel much freer.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.250
Plunged into chaos.

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.250
The door!

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:23.916
Mrs. Rodríguez, anarchy isn't chaos,
it's order and workers' organization.

01:22:23.916 --> 01:22:26.000
No God, no master, no sovereign.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.875
That is a utopia.

01:22:28.208 --> 01:22:29.583
Good evening.

01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:31.458
Are you Mr. Abel Velilla?

01:22:31.458 --> 01:22:33.625
- Who are you?
- That's me, what's going on?

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:37.083
Mr. Velilla, you are under arrest
for multiple robberies and rapes.

01:22:37.666 --> 01:22:39.541
- This must be a mistake.
- Sit down, madam.

01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:42.416
- Miss, please, he's dangerous.
- He didn't do anything.

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:43.375
No!

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:46.541
He's responsible
for the anarchist group assaults.

01:22:46.541 --> 01:22:47.666
That's not true.

01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:51.708
I will ignore where the accused was
at the time of his arrest

01:22:51.708 --> 01:22:54.083
so as to not tarnish
your reputation, Miss Rodríguez,

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:56.875
- but do not take me for a liar.
- Let go of my daughter.

01:22:57.458 --> 01:22:58.416
Let me go!

01:22:58.416 --> 01:23:00.708
No one here is taking you for a liar.

01:23:01.791 --> 01:23:02.625
Don't move.

01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:07.041
You two may be very intelligent,
but this kid was fooling you.

01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:09.083
- I didn't do anything.
- Abel, what happened?

01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:11.166
- Take him away.
- I didn't do anything.

01:23:14.541 --> 01:23:17.083
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:49.125
"Sigh no more, ladies,

01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:51.500
"sigh no more.

01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:54.541
"Men were deceivers ever.

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:57.333
"One foot in sea,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.625
"and one on shore,

01:24:00.125 --> 01:24:02.208
"to one thing constant never.

01:24:03.458 --> 01:24:06.458
"Then sigh not so, but let them go.

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:09.375
"And be you blithe and bonny.

01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:12.083
"Converting all your sounds of woe

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:14.625
"into hey nonny, nonny.

01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:19.125
"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more.

01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:22.041
"Men were deceivers ever.

01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:26.125
"One foot in sea, and one on shore,

01:24:26.791 --> 01:24:28.750
"to one thing constant never."

01:24:57.375 --> 01:25:00.666
<i>It's precisely at this point</i>

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:03.750
<i>that begins the restlessness</i>

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:06.000
<i>of leaving forms of sounds</i>

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.041
<i>in order to enjoy their reproduction.</i>

01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:13.750
<i>In the year 1877</i>

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:16.166
<i>General Electric emerges,</i>

01:25:16.166 --> 01:25:18.791
<i>succeeding in leaving registered sounds...</i>

01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:24.875
ABEL VELILLA SENTENCED TO PRISON

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:27.375
The new maid will be here in an hour.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.750
Her name is Rosa.

01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:33.375
She's old, but I think she works well.

01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:34.958
What happened to Macarena?

01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:37.958
Did she quit or did you fire her?

01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:43.208
That's not important.

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.125
But I do hope this one is more serious.

01:25:48.833 --> 01:25:50.583
Start working on the new texts.

01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:52.958
We're playing badminton in one hour.

01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:56.541
I'll get it.

01:25:56.541 --> 01:25:58.083
Maybe it's Macarena.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.083
Hildegart.

01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:07.083
Abel came to see me
before he was arrested.

01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:08.208
No, no. Please.

01:26:08.208 --> 01:26:10.791
- He asked me to...
- Mr. Guzmán.

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.708
Macarena didn't come to collect the money

01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:15.583
I owed you from the last edition.

01:26:18.666 --> 01:26:20.416
Macarena no longer works in this house.

01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:23.208
How come?

01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:28.458
I'll need you to sign a receipt.

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:40.041
This arrived for you from London.

01:26:50.416 --> 01:26:51.875
Do you think he did it?

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.250
I don't know.

01:26:57.625 --> 01:26:59.416
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.291
- Anything else?
- No, that is all.

01:27:02.166 --> 01:27:04.583
I just hope to get to read
the new essay soon.

01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:06.458
It'll be ready shortly. Good day.

01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:11.541
A waltz?

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:13.250
Let's go.

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:38.000
SECOND CLASS PASSENGER TICKET
LONDON

01:27:49.541 --> 01:27:50.666
This is our house.

01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:52.958
I'm sorry. This is the last thing
I wanted to happen.

01:27:52.958 --> 01:27:54.625
I hope you can forgive me.

01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:55.875
Here's the living room.

01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:58.000
Come this way, please.

01:27:58.666 --> 01:27:59.833
Here's the...

01:28:01.166 --> 01:28:04.208
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to eat before I kept going.

01:28:04.833 --> 01:28:06.791
I'm sorry, this is my daughter, Hildegart.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.375
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:11.916
People talk a lot about your books.

01:28:11.916 --> 01:28:13.416
Have you read any?

01:28:13.416 --> 01:28:15.708
No, I can't read.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:17.958
Shall we continue?

01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:19.291
This way.

01:29:17.416 --> 01:29:24.333
<i>I was young and beautiful</i>

01:29:25.041 --> 01:29:29.166
<i>With a young boy
With a young boy</i>

01:29:29.166 --> 01:29:36.375
<i>I didn't love</i>

01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:40.500
<i>My mother married me off
My mother married me off</i>

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.958
<i>I was young and beautiful</i>

01:30:23.833 --> 01:30:25.333
What do you want?

01:30:26.041 --> 01:30:27.708
- Are you Antonio?
- Macarena isn't here.

01:30:27.708 --> 01:30:29.291
I want to talk to her.

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:32.458
- She's not here, I can't help you.
- I need to talk to her. It's important.

01:30:32.458 --> 01:30:33.875
Girl, I don't want to hurt you.

01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:38.083
I'm not leaving until I talk to her.

01:30:39.583 --> 01:30:41.083
Let me talk to her.

01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:45.041
She won't bring you any trouble.

01:30:46.791 --> 01:30:47.916
That better be true.

01:30:51.875 --> 01:30:53.375
You shouldn't be here.

01:30:53.375 --> 01:30:55.666
This is no place
for a girl from a good family.

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.333
Macarena, I'm not a little girl anymore.

01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:10.458
Why did you leave?

01:31:14.375 --> 01:31:17.166
I need to know
why you left me without saying anything.

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:22.291
And I needed to know
what I should forgive you for...

01:31:24.041 --> 01:31:26.208
until I saw Antonio and his friends.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.833
Was it my mother's idea?

01:31:35.625 --> 01:31:37.041
Or was it you?

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:39.166
Like the gun.

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:41.958
How can you think that about me?

01:31:41.958 --> 01:31:43.875
I don't know what to think anymore.

01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:46.416
About you or about anyone.

01:31:50.166 --> 01:31:51.500
It was your mother.

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:56.083
She found out that Antonio
was responsible for the assaults.

01:31:57.250 --> 01:31:59.250
She offered to give him money
and not report him

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:01.166
in exchange for selling Abel out.

01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:04.416
How could you?

01:32:04.416 --> 01:32:07.333
I swear on my life I tried to prevent it.
I swear to God.

01:32:07.333 --> 01:32:10.375
There's an innocent man in jail
paying for your lack of character.

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.000
Is that really what you think?

01:32:20.416 --> 01:32:22.208
You, being so smart and well-read?

01:32:23.208 --> 01:32:25.541
Do you really think
that's the way life works?

01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:27.000
That it's that easy?

01:32:28.625 --> 01:32:30.583
Do you think I like living like this?

01:32:32.166 --> 01:32:34.875
Not all of us have been
as lucky as you, honey.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.333
Your speeches are great,
but life doesn't work like that.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.208
Without money, you're not free.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.125
Us women aren't free.

01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:54.541
I'll give you one day
to report Antonio to the police

01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:57.041
and explain to them
that you had nothing to do with it.

01:33:00.083 --> 01:33:03.875
If you don't, I'll go myself and make sure
you're charged as an accomplice.

01:33:06.708 --> 01:33:08.125
I'm really sorry.

01:33:47.208 --> 01:33:48.458
You're late.

01:33:51.458 --> 01:33:54.166
Macarena is on her way
to report her husband.

01:33:55.583 --> 01:33:58.041
I guess if you meet with him
and pay him enough money,

01:33:58.041 --> 01:33:59.708
he won't say you were involved.

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:15.333
When Abel is released,
I will go to London with him.

01:34:16.375 --> 01:34:18.416
Havelock sent me the tickets.

01:34:21.208 --> 01:34:23.291
No, you won't.

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:35.708
How could you?

01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:40.875
How could you?

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:43.791
It's my life's work.

01:34:44.916 --> 01:34:46.291
I did what I had to do.

01:34:46.291 --> 01:34:47.708
At what cost?

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:52.291
At the cost of my happiness
and the life of an innocent man.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.750
No project succeeds without sacrifice.

01:34:56.833 --> 01:34:58.208
Careful, Mother.

01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:01.250
You're starting to sound like a fascist.

01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:05.083
After everything I've done for you.

01:35:05.791 --> 01:35:08.083
Everything you've ever done
was for your own sake.

01:35:08.666 --> 01:35:10.291
What have I done for my own sake?

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.000
Tell me.

01:35:16.291 --> 01:35:17.875
What have I done for my own sake?

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:20.416
I gave up my life
for the sake of the world.

01:35:20.416 --> 01:35:22.916
The world doesn't know you exist.

01:35:22.916 --> 01:35:25.666
The world you and I desire, Mother,

01:35:25.666 --> 01:35:27.625
if it is indeed the same one,

01:35:28.125 --> 01:35:29.666
is not built like this.

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:34.000
You are the enemy of your own ideas.

01:35:35.291 --> 01:35:37.125
What would you know about the world?

01:35:38.958 --> 01:35:40.541
I am your whole world.

01:35:41.583 --> 01:35:43.250
All your ideas are mine.

01:35:46.833 --> 01:35:48.458
You love me.

01:35:48.458 --> 01:35:50.208
There was a time when you loved me.

01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:53.125
You don't know what love is.

01:35:57.208 --> 01:35:59.041
I know more about love than you do.

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.083
You only have one driving force

01:36:02.583 --> 01:36:04.666
and a rudimentary psyche.

01:36:04.666 --> 01:36:08.166
Animals have
a more exquisite soul than yours.

01:36:12.208 --> 01:36:14.375
No one has ever loved
as much as I love you.

01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:17.666
No one.

01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:23.875
And I won't let a man
take you away from...

01:36:23.875 --> 01:36:25.875
Enough!

01:36:27.916 --> 01:36:30.666
Men aren't our enemies, Mother.

01:36:30.666 --> 01:36:32.625
You deny humanity.

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:35.250
You deny women.

01:36:36.041 --> 01:36:37.208
You hate them.

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:39.583
You hate the fact that we can feel.

01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:42.958
And there is no possible revolution
without love.

01:36:47.375 --> 01:36:50.833
That's the kind of love that enslaves us.

01:36:50.833 --> 01:36:52.291
That's a lie.

01:36:52.291 --> 01:36:54.791
- That's true.
- That's a lie!

01:36:55.708 --> 01:36:57.958
You're not on the side of women.

01:36:58.333 --> 01:37:00.333
You keep behaving like a man.

01:37:00.333 --> 01:37:04.791
You want to own me
just like men own women.

01:37:04.791 --> 01:37:06.916
For your own interest.

01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:10.708
And nobody owns us, Mother.

01:37:10.708 --> 01:37:12.416
Nobody owns us.

01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:16.791
Nobody owns me.

01:37:21.958 --> 01:37:23.208
I own you.

01:37:26.875 --> 01:37:28.333
Nobody owns me.

01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:50.166
From now on I will make my own decisions.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.708
From now on I am free.

01:38:11.458 --> 01:38:12.916
Good night, Hildegart.

01:38:14.708 --> 01:38:16.208
Good night, Mom.

01:38:35.208 --> 01:38:41.208
WITCHES WHORES
WHORES YOU ARE GOING TO HELL

01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:04.833
Is something the matter, madam?

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.333
Take the dog for a walk, please.

01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:08.541
Right now?

01:39:09.666 --> 01:39:10.750
Go on, get dressed.

01:39:11.291 --> 01:39:13.166
Take him for a long walk.

01:39:13.166 --> 01:39:15.041
As you wish, madam.

01:41:07.708 --> 01:41:10.833
<i>My mother married me off
My mother married me off</i>

01:41:10.833 --> 01:41:17.250
<i>I was young and beautiful</i>

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.666
<i>I have loved and hated to extremes.</i>

01:43:07.875 --> 01:43:11.333
<i>My middle ground is
the automatic mechanical human.</i>

01:43:14.958 --> 01:43:17.083
<i>What happened seems so logical to me.</i>

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:19.750
<i>So precise.</i>

01:43:23.291 --> 01:43:25.541
I'm a bit more celestial than the usual.

01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:29.583
There is eccentricity
in what I did, I know.

01:43:34.291 --> 01:43:36.375
But you...

01:43:39.625 --> 01:43:43.791
you cannot simply analyze the case
of the mother of the human statue.

01:43:48.625 --> 01:43:51.208
The day I had my daughter,
I stopped thinking about myself.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.291
The only thing I cared about
was the creation of that human being.

01:43:56.875 --> 01:43:59.708
Invigorating,
drop by drop, my belief in her.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:06.791
But you men,

01:44:08.125 --> 01:44:09.458
distracted,

01:44:10.458 --> 01:44:13.291
failed to see that I was a planet
with a light of my own.

01:44:15.583 --> 01:44:18.416
You failed to understand
that the work wasn't meant for a place.

01:44:20.916 --> 01:44:24.333
You failed to see the extent
of a sculptor's connection with his work.

01:44:25.666 --> 01:44:28.625
Who, after noticing
the slightest imperfection, destroys it.

01:44:32.041 --> 01:44:34.791
That's what I did to Hildegart.

01:44:37.208 --> 01:44:39.083
The human homo statue.

01:44:40.166 --> 01:44:41.291
My work.

01:44:45.875 --> 01:44:47.958
The Hildegart project had failed.

01:44:48.791 --> 01:44:51.125
There was no point in keeping it going.

01:45:17.916 --> 01:45:20.666
SHOT TO DEATH BY HER MOTHER
IN GALILEO STREET, WHERE SHE LIVED

01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:23.750
HILDEGART
SHOT DEAD IN HER HOME

01:45:26.583 --> 01:45:28.750
HILDEGART
THE SEXUAL REBELLION OF YOUTH

01:46:21.166 --> 01:46:22.958
THE RED VIRGIN IS DEAD

01:48:13.583 --> 01:48:17.041
Hildegart Rodríguez Carballeira died
on June 9th, 1933, at the age of 18.

01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:19.791
She wrote 16 essay books
and over 150 articles

01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:22.125
in the last three years of her life.

01:48:22.125 --> 01:48:25.666
Her work and that of her peers
was forgotten after the Spanish Civil War.

01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:28.458
It lingered on in the spectral plane.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.958
<i>"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more.</i>

01:48:49.958 --> 01:48:52.750
<i>"Men were deceivers ever.</i>

01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:56.666
<i>"One foot in sea, and one on shore,</i>

01:48:56.666 --> 01:48:58.958
<i>"to one thing constant never.</i>

01:48:59.625 --> 01:49:03.041
<i>"Let them go and be you blithe and bonny.</i>

01:49:03.041 --> 01:49:07.291
<i>"Converting all your sounds of woe
into hey nonny, nonny.</i>

01:52:33.125 --> 01:52:36.791
<i>"Then sigh not so, but let them go.</i>

01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:38.708
<i>"And be you blithe and bonny.</i>

01:52:39.458 --> 01:52:42.166
<i>"Converting all your sounds of woe</i>

01:52:42.166 --> 01:52:44.333
<i>"into hey nonny, nonny.</i>

01:52:46.166 --> 01:52:47.750
<i>"Sigh no more.</i>

01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:50.166
<i>"Men were deceivers ever.</i>

01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:55.125
<i>"One foot in sea, and one on shore,</i>

01:52:55.125 --> 01:52:57.666
<i>"to one thing constant never.</i>

01:53:06.958 --> 01:53:11.125
<i>"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more."</i>
