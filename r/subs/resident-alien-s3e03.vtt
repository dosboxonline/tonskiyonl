00:01.436 --> 00:03.046
<i>Previously on
"Resident Alien..."</i>

00:03.046 --> 00:04.091
<i>Hello, asshole.</i>

00:04.091 --> 00:05.483
<i>I have Asta on my side,</i>

00:05.483 --> 00:07.572
<i>and we will find out
why you are here.</i>

00:07.572 --> 00:11.011
You will tell me everything
that you know about Harry.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.448
<i>I have him trapped.</i>
- I printed out this still.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.058
This guy in the passenger seat
is the key

00:15.058 --> 00:16.712
<i>to our whole investigation.</i>

00:16.712 --> 00:18.148
<i>I'm not getting
a lot of sleep,</i>

00:18.148 --> 00:19.758
<i>thanks to the owl
outside my window.</i>

00:19.758 --> 00:21.673
You just need to get out of
the house for a little bit.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.762
- I know the perfect place.
- Yellowstone.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.329
<i>I have been trying to learn
what the Greys</i>

00:25.329 --> 00:27.505
<i>are doing on Earth,
and perhaps the answer</i>

00:27.505 --> 00:31.031
<i>has been in Mayor Snowflake's
foot all along.</i>

00:32.336 --> 00:35.861
Yeah.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.044
Hi.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.742
My sweet girl.

00:46.742 --> 00:49.701
Hi.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.965
Oh, my sweet girl.

00:52.965 --> 00:55.620
Hi.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.274
My sweet girl.

00:59.146 --> 01:02.062
No.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.454
Ten more minutes, please!

01:03.454 --> 01:06.675
No! Come back!

01:09.939 --> 01:12.985
At least let me remember
this time.

01:12.985 --> 01:16.076
Please, let me remember!

01:28.610 --> 01:32.222
You had no business
dragging Asta into your mess.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.703
You could have gotten her
killed by that alien.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.574
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:36.574 --> 01:39.882
I can't remember
what the hell I was thinking

01:39.882 --> 01:41.492
with such an empty stomach.

01:41.492 --> 01:44.104
Should someone
turn on the griddle?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.583
That's your problem.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.064
You don't think of anyone
but yourself.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.370
That is not true.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.762
Other people
will want pancakes.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.199
Also, I'm wearing a shirt
and shoes.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.331
Where is my service?

01:54.331 --> 01:58.683
Dad, yes, it was scary,
but I chose to go.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.076
She's OK.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.165
I had her back,
like I always do.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.688
We were saved
by a 12-year-old boy.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.125
Not if I tell
the story first.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.778
<i>I do not understand</i>

02:06.778 --> 02:09.520
<i>why they are so upset about
Joseph nearly killing them.</i>

02:09.520 --> 02:12.349
<i>Every being
must fight to survive.</i>

02:12.349 --> 02:15.135
<i>Moths camouflage themselves
from predators.</i>

02:15.135 --> 02:17.224
<i>Cacti grow spikes.</i>

02:17.224 --> 02:18.877
<i>Humans are no exception.</i>

02:18.877 --> 02:21.271
<i>They forget they are
surrounded by forces</i>

02:21.271 --> 02:22.968
<i>greater than themselves.</i>

02:22.968 --> 02:25.971
<i>Survival is never guaranteed.</i>

02:25.971 --> 02:27.364
I need to go.

02:27.364 --> 02:31.803
Me and my empty stomach
need to go listen

02:31.803 --> 02:35.459
to the mayor complain about
how his antidepressants

02:35.459 --> 02:37.505
are ruining his sex drive.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.246
I think therapy is supposed
to be confidential.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.683
Also, nasty.
- I said "a mayor."

02:41.683 --> 02:45.513
Some mayor
from some other town,

02:45.513 --> 02:48.646
who hates it when Sheriff Mike
whistles to get his attention.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.347
Uh, well, some other mayor
canceled therapy

02:53.347 --> 02:56.480
because they're going on
a family trip to Yellowstone.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.743
Yellowstone.

02:58.743 --> 02:59.788
Yellowstone!

03:05.097 --> 03:07.491
OK, now, we didn't get
a match on the fingerprint,

03:07.491 --> 03:09.493
so we got to go back
to what we do have.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.626
Now, tell me,
what do you see here, Deputy?

03:11.626 --> 03:13.497
Peter Bach
driving the day he died

03:13.497 --> 03:16.283
and a mystery man
in a plaid shirt next to him.

03:16.283 --> 03:19.764
OK, well let me introduce you
to our unsub, Mr. Plaid, right?

03:19.764 --> 03:22.419
Look how he's sitting--
upright, prepared.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.682
And what does that suggest?
I'll give you a hint.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.250
It begins with the letter M.
- Military.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.688
- Mime.
- That was my second guess.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.430
A mime is a undervalued
physical discipline.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.389
Their posture's active
even when they sitting still,

03:35.389 --> 03:37.565
and you don't ever
hear 'em coming.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.003
We might be looking
at a killer mime.

03:41.003 --> 03:45.181
Or, thinking outside
the invisible box,

03:45.181 --> 03:47.923
what if he were military
but served a long time ago,

03:47.923 --> 03:49.881
which could explain
why we didn't get a hit

03:49.881 --> 03:51.492
on his prints,
because of a backlog

03:51.492 --> 03:52.928
of military archives?

03:52.928 --> 03:55.060
Now, that's true,
but there's just one problem.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.758
There's no mimes
in the military.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.281
They got "Don't talk,
don't tell."

03:58.281 --> 03:59.935
Well, let's take our chances.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.633
We need inside access.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.461
You want to try
your military connections?

04:04.461 --> 04:06.202
No, I don't want
to leave a trail.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.899
Joseph served.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.597
We can have him look into it,
but he didn't come in today.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.903
Well, we should talk
to Detective Torres.

04:11.903 --> 04:14.906
She has connections with every
three-letter agency there is.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.212
Nice try, Deputy.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.909
Think you're gonna
make a phone call

04:17.909 --> 04:20.260
and trick us
into getting back together?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.087
Not a chance.

04:22.087 --> 04:24.089
It's ringing.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.221
Voicemail.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.657
Hi, Detective.

04:26.657 --> 04:29.094
It's Deputy Baker,
over in Patience.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.662
We were wondering if
you could help us with a print

04:31.662 --> 04:35.057
we're trying to nail down.
We've had no luck with AFIS.

04:35.057 --> 04:39.322
And by we, I mean me,

04:39.322 --> 04:41.585
definitely not the Sheriff,

04:41.585 --> 04:44.980
because he has his own life

04:44.980 --> 04:47.417
and he's really...

04:47.417 --> 04:50.290
horny?
Really happy.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.380
I mean, he's happy.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.903
OK, then.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.775
Call me back.

04:57.775 --> 05:01.213
Have you tried writing
with your other hand?

05:01.213 --> 05:03.694
I'm sure--

05:03.694 --> 05:05.479
Oh!
Well, well, well!

05:05.479 --> 05:08.003
Hello, Sheriff.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.657
Came to turn myself in,

05:09.657 --> 05:12.007
since I broke
a few laws last night.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.185
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.622
All right.
- Mwah!

05:18.622 --> 05:21.277
- Oh, dear God.
- Oh, so Mike?

05:21.277 --> 05:22.800
Mm-hmm?

05:22.800 --> 05:25.237
Uh, I would like for you
to please meet my mom.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.935
This is April.
- Hi.

05:26.935 --> 05:30.068
Doesn't she like so sexy?
Look at that ass.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.027
Show him that ass.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.376
Everyone thinks
that we're sisters, so...

05:33.376 --> 05:34.638
Oh.

05:34.638 --> 05:35.987
People are shocked to hear

05:35.987 --> 05:38.076
that she's
14 years older than me.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.991
Mm!
I bet they are.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.166
I've heard a lot about you, Sheriff.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.472
Hmm?

05:42.472 --> 05:44.344
My daughter
tells me everything.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.562
Everything.
- Everything.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.477
Gross.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.870
- So Mikey?
- Mm-hmm?

05:48.870 --> 05:52.482
I wanted to invite you to
my birthday dinner

05:52.482 --> 05:55.398
this weekend,
which will be so much more fun

05:55.398 --> 05:58.662
with my very special plus-one.
- Oh!

05:58.662 --> 06:00.360
Don't we have
that other thing this weekend?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.405
- No, we do not.
- Mm!

06:02.405 --> 06:04.668
At dinner,
we talk about her dowry.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.149
You drove her off the lot.
You got to pay for it.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.760
Oh!

06:09.760 --> 06:12.676
- Ooh!
- It's spicy margarita!

06:12.676 --> 06:14.504
Spicy mama-rita!

06:14.504 --> 06:16.071
Yeah, that's--

06:16.071 --> 06:17.377
OK.
- OK.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.943
- Mm-hmm.
- So you'll call me?

06:18.943 --> 06:21.511
Yeah.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.209
You want to go
to a party Saturday night?

06:24.209 --> 06:26.211
No, I do not.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.996
Mm, ah.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.047
Now, go put the rest of your
stuff in your backpack, OK?

06:36.047 --> 06:38.223
Why are we going
to Yellowstone in the winter?

06:38.223 --> 06:39.573
It's freezing there.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.184
Winter is the best time
to go anywhere.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.882
Seasonal depression
increases suicide rates,

06:44.882 --> 06:46.318
so fewer people are traveling.

06:46.318 --> 06:49.147
We are going to have
the whole park to ourselves.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.801
It's going to be great!

06:50.801 --> 06:52.150
Give you a chance
to clear your head,

06:52.150 --> 06:56.198
massage, rest, fresh start.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.895
Hey, Dr. Vanderspeigle.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.289
I heard you're taking
a trip to Yellowstone.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.595
I will be joining you.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.640
Oh, uh, well,

07:03.640 --> 07:06.208
it's actually sort of
a family holiday--

07:06.208 --> 07:07.209
Yeah.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.995
Family.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.520
I had a family once.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.261
Two loving parents.

07:16.261 --> 07:21.266
They promised to take me
to Yellowstone to play

07:21.266 --> 07:24.574
with the yellow stones.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.751
I dreamed of us
being there together in--

07:28.839 --> 07:31.015
I want to say nature?

07:31.015 --> 07:32.626
Mm-hmm?

07:32.626 --> 07:35.411
But the day
we were supposed to leave,

07:35.411 --> 07:37.108
they died.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.767
That's the story.
They died.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.595
It was sad.
They're both dead.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.467
Oh, yes, yes.
That is so sad.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.252
- Yeah.
- Mm.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.863
Maybe we should bring
a doctor with us, just in case.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.386
Uh, I think there are doctors
in Yellowstone.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.475
Mm-hmm.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.780
What if you get
in a car accident

07:56.780 --> 07:58.608
on the way there?
You both die on impact.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.045
Max is left alone, hungry.

08:01.045 --> 08:04.832
He has to eat the dead flesh
of his parents.

08:04.832 --> 08:09.967
If I'm there, he could eat me.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.535
Not really sure how you being
a doctor factors in there.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.102
OK, you know what?

08:14.102 --> 08:16.539
It's-- it's fine.

08:16.539 --> 08:19.803
You can come with us. Yeah.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.675
<i>Ben's alien abductions
are obviously</i>

08:21.675 --> 08:23.938
<i>leading him to something
at Yellowstone,</i>

08:23.938 --> 08:28.116
<i>and I will be right there
to discover what it is.</i>

08:28.116 --> 08:30.597
Shotgun!
- Oh.

08:41.477 --> 08:44.045
Yellowstone Hotel,
please hold.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.264
This is nice.
It's very charming.

08:46.264 --> 08:48.440
Yeah,
definitely more relaxing

08:48.440 --> 08:50.573
than a car ride
with Harry reciting

08:50.573 --> 08:52.619
every single "Law and Order"
episode from memory.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.577
Yeah.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.101
OK, we're alone.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.755
Now, you can tell me
why you're here.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.278
But I haven't finished yet!

09:00.278 --> 09:04.282
Then Lennie Briscoe says,
"Well, life is short."

09:04.282 --> 09:08.069
Because he was short.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.898
Also, he was dead.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.334
I forgot that part.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.379
Come on.
You owe me.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.207
I convinced them
to let you come.

09:16.207 --> 09:19.210
OK, I will tell you
why I am here.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.647
<i>To follow your father</i>

09:20.647 --> 09:22.953
<i>to the Greys'
secret headquarters.</i>

09:22.953 --> 09:27.175
To... enjoy this
cartoon raccoon.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.700
A raccoon?

09:30.700 --> 09:32.702
<i>What powers
the thousands of geysers</i>

09:32.702 --> 09:34.617
<i>and hot springs
here at Yellowstone?</i>

09:34.617 --> 09:36.663
<i>Heat from
the volcanic magma chamber</i>

09:36.663 --> 09:37.794
<i>beneath your feet!</i>

09:37.794 --> 09:41.972
<i>Ouch! That's hot!</i>

09:41.972 --> 09:43.844
That was worth the drive.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.542
I read about your
hot stone massages online.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.500
Can I book one of those here?
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.111
Our massage studio is closed.
- What?

09:50.111 --> 09:52.026
- Oh.
- No, no.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.550
I read about it,
um, on the website.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.073
It says that it's
open year-round.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.945
It is,
but we just had a snowstorm,

09:57.945 --> 10:00.512
and our massage therapist
can't get down to the hotel.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.905
Plow won't get up there
for a while.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.820
What's the plow situation
with your manicurist?

10:03.820 --> 10:04.952
You're in luck.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.170
I do the manicures.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.738
Ah!
- Oh! Pierced.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.696
You know what?
Actually,

10:09.696 --> 10:10.740
I think I'm just gonna

10:10.740 --> 10:12.089
probably be
wearing my mittens.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.830
I'll see you upstairs, honey.
- Mm.

10:13.830 --> 10:14.831
Do you want to see?

10:14.831 --> 10:16.703
That is really neat.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.009
How do you get it
through the nail like that?

10:40.901 --> 10:44.078
Mm.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.428
- Hey, you OK?
- Hey.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.647
Yeah.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.346
Crying baby
next-door woke me up.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.306
Can you hear it?
- Mm-mm.

10:55.306 --> 10:58.135
No, I don't think so.

11:13.716 --> 11:18.155
♪ I'll come along
and butter your part, baby ♪

11:18.155 --> 11:23.160
♪ Don't chew
your bread without me ♪

11:23.160 --> 11:26.076

♪ Don't chew

11:33.649 --> 11:35.651
Hey, D'Arce.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.000
Hmm?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.915
- Hey?
- Oh.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.351
Hey, Liv.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.397
I need to talk
to you about something.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.659
Is this about
who made the big snow penis

11:43.659 --> 11:45.095
outside Town Hall?
- What?

11:45.095 --> 11:47.402
- What?
- No.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.186
I need your help
ID-ing a suspect.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.928
You see a ton of people
come through here.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.670
I thought you might recognize
who's in the passenger seat.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.979
<i>[dramatic music[</i>

12:00.632 --> 12:04.898
No, I've definitely
never seen this guy before.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.247
Not ever, never.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.814
Did you know that "never"
is short for "not ever"?

12:07.814 --> 12:10.251
I feel like
I maybe made that up.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.513
Anyway, I haven't seen him.

12:11.513 --> 12:15.256
What about the shirt?
Is it familiar?

12:15.256 --> 12:16.910
It's Colorado.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.303
The people here are practically
made of plaid.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.961
Did that guy just leave
and forget his...

12:24.961 --> 12:27.181
martini shaker?

12:27.181 --> 12:28.312
Yep.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.966
It's definitely his.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.969
I'm just gonna--

12:32.969 --> 12:35.755
- Heyo.
- Hey.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.236
I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was listening.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.629
Oh.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.109
I hope the case
isn't too dangerous.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.327
Oh.

12:43.327 --> 12:46.156
'Cause I worry about Mike,
you know?

12:46.156 --> 12:48.245
Cop's old lady.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.594
You know how it is.
It's like...

12:49.594 --> 12:51.161
Nope.

12:51.161 --> 12:54.686
Every time the phone rings,
is this gonna be the call?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.819
It's scary.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.822
Hey, I need you to give him
a message from me.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.519
OK.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.913
Oh.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.661
Hey.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.358
How was your date
the other night?

13:14.358 --> 13:15.838
It didn't look like
it was going so well.

13:15.838 --> 13:20.190
Yeah, not good.
Uh, he was barely human.

13:20.190 --> 13:23.063
OK. Well, good.
I'm glad.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.369
Because that means
you might be free Saturday.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.850
There's a scare-a-thon
double horror feature.

13:27.850 --> 13:31.549
I thought we could go together.
- Yes! I'd love that.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.553
Except I have to work
a double Saturday.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.381
Shoot.
I'm sorry.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.383
That's OK.
Um, no worries.

13:39.383 --> 13:42.212
Another time.
- OK.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.823
Thanks for asking.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.433
Jay!

13:45.433 --> 13:46.869
Oh, my God!
Get in here!

13:46.869 --> 13:49.045
You guys hanging out?
I love that for us.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.960
I'd love to join, but I can't.
I gotta take a rain check.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.223
Sorry.
- All right.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.921
- We got a code red.
- Whoa!

13:54.921 --> 13:56.879
Maybe don't say that.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.969
A lot of things happen
when someone yells that here.

14:01.884 --> 14:05.018
Mike and Liv are onto Harry
for the alien tracker's murder.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.236
- What?
- Yeah.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.282
Liv has a picture of him
in the van.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.458
Well, not all of him,
but his shirt.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.068
You know Liv.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.505
She'll just go closet to closet
to closet till she finds it.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.072
Oh, God.
We need to warn Harry.

14:16.072 --> 14:20.424
Oh, shit, he's out of town.
Um-- I will call him.

14:20.424 --> 14:21.773
- Are you crazy?
- Hey!

14:21.773 --> 14:23.253
Whoa, hey!
What are you doing?

14:23.253 --> 14:27.301
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no! No!

14:27.301 --> 14:29.172
Look, I'm covering your ass.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.131
If Harry's in the crosshairs
for this investigation,

14:31.131 --> 14:32.915
they'll subpoena his phone.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.309
They'll see your text messages,
and then they'll subpoena

14:35.309 --> 14:37.615
your phone, and then bam!

14:37.615 --> 14:39.052
You'll go down with him.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.054
You do know
that the police don't need

14:41.054 --> 14:45.406
the actual phone to retrieve
digital records on it, right?

14:45.406 --> 14:47.451
That's a good point.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.500
I think
someone's in the closet.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.023
Well, that's the
connecting door to the room

14:54.023 --> 14:55.895
we're not using
because nobody from our family

14:55.895 --> 14:56.939
is in that room.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.290
Not using that door!

15:00.290 --> 15:02.249
<i>This one is closer!</i>

15:02.249 --> 15:04.816
Nope, uh, that door
is the family door, OK?

15:04.816 --> 15:07.254
I will meet you
at the normal person door.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.870
God!

15:16.393 --> 15:18.004
I broke a nail!

15:18.004 --> 15:20.832
I-- I would like
to trade these disgusting

15:20.832 --> 15:23.487
fruit teas for some coffee.
There is none in my room.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.489
You, uh, feeling
a bit of a draft there?

15:25.489 --> 15:27.187
Yes, yes.

15:27.187 --> 15:32.496
The cold air on my underparts
keeps my scrotum taut.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.498
OK, well,
I don't really want to know

15:34.498 --> 15:35.935
what's going on
with your scrotum.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.241
Would you mind
closing your robe, please?

15:38.241 --> 15:40.069
Mm.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.289
Uh, we don't have
any coffee in here either.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.812
One of the trucks
got snowed in,

15:43.812 --> 15:45.596
along with half of the staff

15:45.596 --> 15:47.381
because apparently
this is the first winter

15:47.381 --> 15:48.860
it's ever snowed here.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.559
There is fresh coffee
in the lobby, though, so...

15:53.430 --> 15:55.519
I will go get coffee
once I know

15:55.519 --> 15:58.000
what we are doing for the day.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.523
Uh, we?

15:59.523 --> 16:01.917
Oh, I cannot be alone!

16:01.917 --> 16:04.615
I'm sad again
because of dead parents.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.444
May they rest in one piece.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.359
That is sad.

16:09.359 --> 16:12.754
How did they die?
- Max, be nice.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.539
I'm sorry.
Dr. Vanderspeigle, of course.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.019
Of course,
you can come with us.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.413
You know, I was thinking
that we could try snowshoeing.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.329
No.
Ben needs to decide.

16:22.329 --> 16:23.895
Here.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.810
Oh, um...

16:25.810 --> 16:29.901
Let your intuition
be your guide.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.865
Tell your intuition
to be specific.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.608
Uh...

16:40.608 --> 16:42.653
- How about a snowcat tour?
- Yeah.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.568
That did not sound
like Ben's voice.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.658
OK, why don't we
just do Old Faithful?

16:47.658 --> 16:49.965
That's a great place to start.
- Sure. Old Faithful.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.662
Wait, are you saying that
because your wife said it

16:51.662 --> 16:53.099
or because you want to do it?

16:53.099 --> 16:54.926
I want to do it
because Kate said it,

16:54.926 --> 16:56.667
and I like it when she's happy.

16:56.667 --> 17:00.280
That's an awful way to live.
Close your eyes.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.283
Close them shut.
- Mm.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.633
What do you see?

17:05.633 --> 17:10.551
A beam in an old barn,
and I am putting my head

17:10.551 --> 17:11.943
through a circle made of rope.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.859
- Honey.
- I already said Old Faithful.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.774
Cool.

17:16.774 --> 17:19.038
- Sounds fun.
- I'm excited.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.214
I'm exhausted.

17:23.216 --> 17:26.654
- OK, the coast is clear.
- OK, thank you, Dad.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.351
I told you
you didn't have to come.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.658
It's just Harry's cabin.
It's safe.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.399
We don't know that.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.140
The guy had a Grey Hybrid
after him.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.403
Who knows
what's coming for him today?

17:36.403 --> 17:38.492
Plus, he nicked
my fishing pole.

17:38.492 --> 17:41.147
I want it back.
- OK.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.236
How does an alien even afford
a cabin on the lake?

17:43.236 --> 17:46.108
More importantly, who gets it
when he goes home or,

17:46.108 --> 17:49.329
you know, when the bat alien--
- Can we focus, please? OK?

17:49.329 --> 17:51.200
Mike and Liv are probably
on their way already,

17:51.200 --> 17:53.072
looking for that plaid shirt.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.466
I mean...

17:56.466 --> 17:58.860
Ooh.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.731
Ha!

18:00.731 --> 18:02.298
What's he,
the Brawny paper towel man?

18:02.298 --> 18:03.865
Whoa.

18:03.865 --> 18:06.128
Look at all that plaid.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.782
OK, what color was it?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.350
Picture was black and white.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.659
Looks like we're gonna
have to burn them all.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.925
<i>Planets are alive.</i>

18:22.797 --> 18:27.193
<i>On Planet Earth, volcanoes,
forest fires, and earthquakes</i>

18:27.193 --> 18:29.760
<i>are just some
of it's natural processes.</i>

18:31.197 --> 18:34.896
<i>They are all necessary
for Earth's survival,</i>

18:34.896 --> 18:37.203
<i>even if they take out
a few million people</i>

18:37.203 --> 18:38.943
<i>now and then.</i>

18:44.384 --> 18:47.038
Water fills the chamber
beneath the geyser,

18:47.038 --> 18:48.649
and eventually,
the water becomes

18:48.649 --> 18:49.954
hot enough to vaporize,

18:49.954 --> 18:51.391
triggering
the massive eruption.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.219
Hey!
Where you been?

18:53.219 --> 18:55.264
You missed it.
- Oh, that's OK.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.006
I saw it on TV once.
I think.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.313
<i>The mayor obviously
does not care about this.</i>

19:00.313 --> 19:03.011
<i>As I feared, Old Faithful
is not what drew him here.</i>

19:03.011 --> 19:04.839
Hey, Dad,
where did you get that hat?

19:04.839 --> 19:06.014
Oh, you like it?

19:06.014 --> 19:07.320
I just bought it
off a guy back there.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.886
You bought a hat
off a stranger?

19:08.886 --> 19:11.672
Well, not just any hat.
It's Sullivan Gravel Company.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.282
They've been around
for, like, 70 years.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.938
- But was it on his head?
- You're missing the point.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.461
Gravel is one of
the most important

19:18.461 --> 19:20.289
building materials
in the whole world.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.465
Gravel is big dirt.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.554
Much more complex than that.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.513
Without gravel,
we couldn't live.

19:26.513 --> 19:29.907
I prefer not living
to this conversation.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.648
Let me look at your map.

19:31.648 --> 19:36.218
Is there anywhere on here
you feel like going next?

19:36.218 --> 19:37.437
How about a shower?

19:37.437 --> 19:39.047
My head is getting
a little itchy.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.483
This thing might be wool.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.356
Uh, maybe it just came off
a stranger's head.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.836
<i>That is why the mayor
was compelled to come here--</i>

19:45.836 --> 19:48.012
<i>Sullivan Gravel.</i>

19:53.496 --> 19:55.846
- Still no sign of Mr. Plaid?
- Nothing.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.762
I've seen Ms. Polka Dot,
Professor Ugly Boots,

19:58.762 --> 20:02.201
and I just got a real good look
at Deputy Can't Park.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.506
I only hit the curb once,

20:03.506 --> 20:05.160
and it was just because
I was distracted

20:05.160 --> 20:07.945
by a pigeon with a limp.
Poor thing.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.251
And then
I almost hit the pigeon.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.513
Don't worry
about limping pigeons.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.385
Over time,
they've developed the ability

20:12.385 --> 20:14.430
to fake ankle injuries
to get more bread from people.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.475
It's sad.

20:15.475 --> 20:16.911
It used to be
such a proud bird.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.000
Oh, and I saw your grandma.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.480
Nana?
Where?

20:20.480 --> 20:22.221
No, no.
Calm down, Deputy.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.352
She's gone.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.875
Sure moves fast
for an old lady,

20:24.875 --> 20:26.137
more like a skitter.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.143
Hi, Lena.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.450
Yeah.

20:34.450 --> 20:39.542
Uh-huh.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.891
He's good.

20:40.891 --> 20:43.067
He's here right now.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.808

20:46.419 --> 20:48.943
I know, but he looks so cute
in that sweater you got him.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.730
I appreciate it.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.906
Talk soon.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.256
Yes!

20:57.256 --> 20:59.388
She has a contact
that can run the print

20:59.388 --> 21:01.782
through a more comprehensive
military database.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.131
Good.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.915
That's good.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.657
I'm sorry
she didn't ask about you.

21:07.657 --> 21:08.658
No, no, it's fine.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.529
I don't care about that,
so long

21:09.529 --> 21:12.445

21:12.445 --> 21:14.577

21:15.665 --> 21:17.928
"To protect and serve?"
Question mark?

21:17.928 --> 21:20.235
It's always that question mark
that's the killer.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.106
Oh, no.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.152

in the alien documentary.

at our secret investigation.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.833
Listen, Deputy,
if I have taught you one thing,

21:52.833 --> 21:55.183
it's that this job
is all about control.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.619

- Mm-hmm.

this is from, Jedi?

22:07.891 --> 22:11.155
Uh, in my defense,
I was drunk, and--

22:11.155 --> 22:13.462
and she smelled like vanilla.
I don't mean vanilla perfume.

22:13.462 --> 22:14.594
I mean, like a damn cake,

22:14.594 --> 22:16.204

The important thing is
we were all here together.

33:45.371 --> 33:46.894
Right?
- Yeah.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.898
And where is Max anyway?

33:50.898 --> 33:52.030
Who knows?
Arcade?

33:59.254 --> 34:02.083
OK, now you hear that, right?
- Hear what?

34:31.199 --> 34:34.507
<i>At least
let me remember this time!</i>

34:34.507 --> 34:36.770
<i>Let me remember!</i>

34:38.685 --> 34:40.295
Kate?

34:41.818 --> 34:42.993
What are you doing?

34:45.866 --> 34:48.608
Is that your baby?

34:48.608 --> 34:49.913
Yes.

34:49.913 --> 34:52.394
- Can I hold her?
- No.

34:52.394 --> 34:53.395
Please--

34:53.395 --> 34:54.657
Come on.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.268
I'm so sorry.
Come on.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.139
<i>The greatest force
in the universe</i>

34:58.139 --> 35:00.968
<i>is entropy,
the tendency toward chaos.</i>

35:00.968 --> 35:03.013
<i>Things fall apart.</i>

35:03.013 --> 35:04.841
<i>There is no extended warranty.</i>

35:04.841 --> 35:08.149
<i>Even if there were,
it would still be a ripoff.</i>

35:08.149 --> 35:10.412
<i>But causing things
to fall apart</i>

35:10.412 --> 35:12.806
<i>outside the natural order
is just wrong.</i>

35:12.806 --> 35:14.590
<i>The Greys are not builders.</i>

35:14.590 --> 35:16.157
<i>They are destroyers.</i>

35:16.157 --> 35:19.073
<i>They are as shortsighted
and selfish as humans,</i>

35:19.073 --> 35:21.597
<i>but even worse,
because they are smarter.</i>

35:21.597 --> 35:23.643
<i>That is why
I have to figure out</i>

35:23.643 --> 35:26.994
<i>why they want to store
so much water underground.</i>

35:26.994 --> 35:29.127
There must be some reason.

35:34.393 --> 35:35.829
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

35:38.223 --> 35:40.486
<i>The Greys' cavern is here.</i>

35:40.486 --> 35:43.793
<i>If they filled it completely
with water,</i>

35:43.793 --> 35:46.753
<i>then connected it by a tunnel
to the magma chamber,</i>

35:46.753 --> 35:49.799
<i>millions of gallons of water
would suddenly heat up,</i>

35:49.799 --> 35:52.324
<i>and the pressure would turn
the 2,000 square miles</i>

35:52.324 --> 35:54.108
<i>of Yellowstone National Park</i>

35:54.108 --> 35:56.328
<i>into the most destructive
natural bomb</i>

35:56.328 --> 35:58.330
<i>in the history of the world.</i>

35:58.330 --> 36:01.594
<i>What powers the thousands
of geysers and hot springs</i>

36:01.594 --> 36:02.986
<i>here in Yellowstone?</i>

36:02.986 --> 36:05.380
<i>Heat from
the volcanic magma chamber</i>

36:05.380 --> 36:10.080
<i>beneath your feet.
Ouch! That's hot!</i>

36:10.080 --> 36:12.213
<i>That's so hot!
Oh, my God!</i>

36:12.213 --> 36:16.261
<i>I'm burning alive.
Oh! Ah!</i>

36:20.265 --> 36:22.528
I found a store in Braddock

36:22.528 --> 36:24.791
that sells the exact
plaid shirt from the video.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.967
They gave me a list
of everyone who bought it,

36:26.967 --> 36:28.490
and six of them
live in Patience.

36:28.490 --> 36:29.839
And guess what?

36:29.839 --> 36:32.190
The shirt was on sale,
so I bought one for John.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.495
Excellent work,
but now, I've got to put

36:33.495 --> 36:35.193
John's name
on the suspect list.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.804
John might want to lawyer up.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.241
- Oh, God, it's Nana.
- Hi!

36:40.241 --> 36:41.808
- Is my tie straight?
- Uh--

36:41.808 --> 36:43.157
- Fix it.
- OK, I'm trying.

36:43.157 --> 36:44.550
- Fix it!
- OK!

36:44.550 --> 36:46.073
Nana!
Hi.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.944
Doing a-- a little shopping?

36:47.944 --> 36:50.686
Well, let's see.
I got a shopping bag.

36:50.686 --> 36:53.602
Oh, could I be shopping?

36:53.602 --> 36:55.256
Uh, it's good seeing you
again, Miss Patty.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.563
I'll go warm up the truck.
- Nope.

36:57.563 --> 37:00.261
Oh, is this one giving you
a hard time

37:00.261 --> 37:02.263
since she became a big shot?

37:02.263 --> 37:05.832
Picture in the paper,
just like Princess Margaret.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.269
Oh, you read the article?

37:08.269 --> 37:10.576
Of course
I read the article, Liv.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.447
I was interviewed for it.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.233
Not that they gave me
any credit.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.323
So you're the unnamed source?

37:18.323 --> 37:20.586
You called me a liar, Nana.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.109
I did not.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.546
I called you a fantasist.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.592
I said you were always
making stuff up

37:26.592 --> 37:29.943
and your relationship with
reality was tenuous at best.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.423
That seems worse.

37:31.423 --> 37:35.992
For Pete's sake,
fix your uniform.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.777
You can't expect
to get any respect

37:37.777 --> 37:40.127
if you're walking around town
like you're

37:40.127 --> 37:42.956
the cheapest girl
in the whorehouse.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.785
Right, Sheriff?

37:45.785 --> 37:47.265
Bye, Nana.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.529
She's so funny.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.331
Oh, hey,
it's from Detective Torres.

38:10.331 --> 38:13.552
Her contact got a match
on that print from the van.

38:13.552 --> 38:16.642
Dr. Wendy Beasley,
retired military chemist.

38:16.642 --> 38:17.860
You were right.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.427
Her prints were in
the military archives.

38:19.427 --> 38:22.256
Are you kidding me?
We did it!

38:22.256 --> 38:25.085
We got a match!
This is great news!

38:28.088 --> 38:30.656
I try so hard!

38:42.058 --> 38:44.583
It's OK, Deputy.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.719
So the Greys
want to kill us all

38:50.719 --> 38:51.894
and take the planet
for themselves?

38:51.894 --> 38:52.982
Yes.

38:52.982 --> 38:54.767
I do not know why
they are doing it.

38:54.767 --> 38:58.510
They cannot live long in
Earth's atmosphere or gravity.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.120
So how long till it blows up?

39:00.120 --> 39:02.122
Based on the amount of water
it will take

39:02.122 --> 39:05.386
to fill the cavern,
maybe a year.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.693
I mean, a year is plenty
of time to stop them, right?

39:07.693 --> 39:09.477
I love a year.
We could do a year.

39:09.477 --> 39:10.957
Yes.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.786
I will stop the Greys
from destroying the planet.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.396
OK.

39:15.396 --> 39:19.269
I can't talk about the end
of the world without dessert.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.402
Thanks, Dad.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.665
Uh-- but I--

39:23.665 --> 39:26.712
Harry's gonna stop
Yellowstone from blowing up.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.671
What? No!
I did not say that.

39:29.671 --> 39:32.631
I said I will stop the Greys
from blowing it up.

39:32.631 --> 39:36.330
I cannot stop Yellowstone
from blowing itself up.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.592
I'm sorry, what?

39:39.246 --> 39:41.248
The Yellowstone Caldera,

39:41.248 --> 39:44.120
it erupts every 600,000 years.

39:44.120 --> 39:49.125
The last time it erupted
was 634,000 years ago.

39:49.125 --> 39:52.694
So, yes, that baby is crowning.

39:52.694 --> 39:56.176
Wouldn't it be funny
if I stopped the Greys,

39:56.176 --> 39:58.657
and then the caldera
blew up right after?

39:58.657 --> 40:00.572
That would be funny.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.225
Because of the timing.

40:02.225 --> 40:05.359
Comedy is all about...

40:20.896 --> 40:23.246
The timing.
- OK, yes.

40:23.246 --> 40:24.857
It's a volcano.

40:24.857 --> 40:28.382
But without the Greys' cave
and the water thing,

40:28.382 --> 40:30.340
it won't be as bad, right?

40:30.340 --> 40:31.820
No, not as bad.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.170
The Earth
will not be destroyed.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.955
OK, good.

40:35.955 --> 40:37.652
It will kill
millions of people,

40:37.652 --> 40:39.524
though, including all of you.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.569
I prefer it
with the whipped cream.

40:41.569 --> 40:42.570
Mm.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.487
I'm not hungry
for pie anymore.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.662
I'll take it.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.534
Do not be worried.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.100
In a few thousand years,

40:51.100 --> 40:55.017
the Earth will return
to normal, reborn.

40:55.017 --> 40:56.497
He's right.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.456
The volcanoes are a big part
of the cycle of things.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.154
They've been going on
a lot longer than we have.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.330
Yeah,
but what are we supposed

41:03.330 --> 41:04.723
to do with this information?

41:04.723 --> 41:06.202
What did you do
with it before?

41:06.202 --> 41:07.726
Not know it?

41:07.726 --> 41:09.858
Well, just keep doing
the only thing you know to do

41:09.858 --> 41:12.339
while you're still alive.

41:12.339 --> 41:14.689

<i>It might seem long to humans,</i>

41:22.958 --> 41:25.483
<i>but when compared

41:25.483 --> 41:28.834

Among the charges,
you broke galactic law

43:01.709 --> 43:04.320

- Mm.

43:04.320 --> 43:08.629
So you are hereby ordered
