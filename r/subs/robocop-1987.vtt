WEBVTT

00:59.017 --> 01:00.643
This is Media Break.

01:00.728 --> 01:04.188
You give us three minutes
and we'll give you the world.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.233
Good morning.
I'm Casey Wong with Jesse Perkins.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.110
Top story, Pretoria.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.112
The threat of nuclear confrontation

01:11.196 --> 01:13.239
in South Africa escalated today

01:13.323 --> 01:15.116
when the ruling
white military government

01:15.200 --> 01:19.245
of that besieged city-state
unveiled a French-made neutron bomb

01:19.329 --> 01:22.582
and affirmed its willingness
to use the three megaton device

01:22.666 --> 01:25.168
as the city's last line of defense.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.920
And the President's first press conference

01:28.005 --> 01:30.506
from the Star Wars
orbiting peace platform

01:30.591 --> 01:32.258
got off to a shaky start,

01:32.342 --> 01:34.343
when power failed causing a brief,

01:34.428 --> 01:36.387
but harmless, period of weightlessness

01:36.472 --> 01:39.056
for the visiting President and his staff.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.184
We'll be back in a moment.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.020
Is it time for that big operation?

01:44.104 --> 01:47.482
This may be
the most important decision of your life.

01:47.733 --> 01:51.486
So come down
and talk to one of our qualified surgeons

01:51.570 --> 01:53.613
here at the Family Heart Center.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.823
We feature the complete Jarvik line,

01:55.908 --> 01:59.368
series 7 Sports Heart by Jensen, Yamaha.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.120
You pick the heart.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.456
Extended warranties, financing.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.374
Qualifies for health tax credit.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.796
And remember, we care.

02:11.423 --> 02:14.509
Three dead police officers,
one critically injured.

02:14.593 --> 02:18.471
Police union leaders blame
Omni Consumer Products, OCP,

02:18.555 --> 02:21.724
the firm which recently
entered into a contract with the city

02:21.809 --> 02:25.228
to fund and run the
Detroit Metropolitan Police Department.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.730
Dick Jones, Division President, OCP.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.774
Every policeman knows
when he joins the force

02:29.858 --> 02:32.026
that there are certain inherent risks
that come with the territory.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.569
Ask any cop, he'll tell you,

02:33.654 --> 02:36.072
"If you can't stand the heat,
you better stay out of the kitchen."

02:36.240 --> 02:39.992
Although seriously wounded,
Officer Frank Frederickson escaped

02:40.077 --> 02:42.036
and identified this man.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.873
Clarence Boddicker,
unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.418
Now sought in connection
with the deaths of 31 police officers.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.795
Today, he's at large,

02:50.879 --> 02:53.464
while doctors at
Henry Ford Memorial Hospital

02:53.549 --> 02:56.676
fight to save the life
of Officer Frank Frederickson.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.927
Good luck, Frank.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.857
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.276
This is a clear violation
of my client's civil rights.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.196
Make it aggravated assault,
and I can make bail, in cash, now.

03:17.281 --> 03:21.033
Listen, pal, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag,

03:21.118 --> 03:23.244
and scumbags see the judge
on Monday morning!

03:23.328 --> 03:27.290
Now get out of my police station,
and take laughing boy with you!

03:27.374 --> 03:28.666
Get over there!

03:29.877 --> 03:32.128
You have the right to remain
silent. Do you understand me?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.296
Sure, sure.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.089
- Priors?
- No.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.257
Hi.

03:36.341 --> 03:40.219
Uh, Murphy. Transferring in
from Metro South.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.804
Nice precinct.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.890
Yeah, pretty good.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.436
We work for a living down here, Murphy.
Get your armor and suit up.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.067
Please take me home!

03:55.152 --> 03:56.903
Not now, E.J. Get a cup of coffee.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.070
Oh, Sarge.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.114
Stark, is there any word on Frederickson?

04:00.198 --> 04:01.908
They're still listing him as critical.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.327
His wife must be going out of her mind.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.995
- Murphy, huh?
- Yeah, that's me.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.246
- Manson.
- Hi.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.081
What brings you to this little paradise?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.834
Beats me, man. I think OCP's moving
a lot of new guys up here.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.838
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.635
They're gonna manage this department
right into the ground!

04:21.053 --> 04:22.762
- Where are you from?
- Metro South.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.930
Welcome to hell.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.348
- Murphy.
- Yo.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.350
You cut 10 guys
loose over on the east side.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.977
You try to get backup
when you're in a jam.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.772
Yeah, try to get a medevac
after you've been jammed.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.775
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike. Fuck 'em!

04:48.205 --> 04:49.372
Oh, boy.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.082
The funeral's tomorrow.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.837
The department requests
all officers not on duty to attend.

04:57.214 --> 05:01.300
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil as usual.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.264
And I don't want to hear
any more talk about strike!

05:07.808 --> 05:11.018
We're not plumbers. We're police officers.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.063
And police officers don't strike.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.111
Murphy, front and center.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.880
Hello, tiger.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.182
Hey, hey, hey!

05:53.437 --> 05:54.478
Oh, yes!

05:56.773 --> 06:00.109
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.569
Get on your feet!

06:06.450 --> 06:08.826
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.412
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighborhood.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.456
Glad to know you, Murphy.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.207
Pretty neat.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.796
I better drive
until you know your way around.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.259
I usually drive
when I'm breaking in a new partner.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.741
You really think
the old man is gonna be there?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.409
Why would they invite us?

06:50.494 --> 06:53.287
All division heads
are bringing their support teams.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.705
It's big.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.749
I figure they're green-lighting Delta City.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.835
What, are you kidding?
They never do anything ahead of schedule.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.464
It's Jones. He's got the 209 series online
and now he wants to show off.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.382
That's a tough break, Bob.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.093
What? What?

07:07.177 --> 07:10.679
Well, ED 209
ran into serious delays and cost overruns.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.848
The old man ordered a backup plan.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.809
95th floor. Have a nice day.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.269
Probably just to
light a fire under Jones' ass.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.814
- Yeah?
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.023
Yeah.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.235
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.613
It's a better plan. Fucking Jones!
I'd go straight to the Old Man if I could.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.949
Don't mess with Jones, man.
He'll make sushi out of you.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.077
Yeah, you better be careful, man.
I heard Jones is a real shark.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.870
- Who asked you, twerp?
- Bob.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.997
What about this police thing,
what's the problem?

07:37.082 --> 07:39.125
Their union's been bitching
ever since we took over.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.252
You know, the usual nonsense.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.461
We'll turn things around.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.840
Mmm-hmm. Good, very good.
Let's get started.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.306
Now, friends,

07:55.642 --> 07:59.728
I've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.400
A dream which I've invited you all
to share with me.

08:05.861 --> 08:10.781
In six months, we begin construction
of Delta City.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.743
Where Old Detroit now stands.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.416
Old Detroit has a cancer.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.085
The cancer is crime.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.172
And it must be cut out
before we employ the 2 million workers

08:26.256 --> 08:28.340
that will breathe life into this city again.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.508
Yes.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.973
Although shifts in the tax structure

08:36.057 --> 08:39.310
have created an economy
ideal for corporate growth,

08:39.436 --> 08:42.605
community services,
in this case law enforcement,

08:43.231 --> 08:44.732
have suffered.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.695
I think it's time we gave something back.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.740
Dick.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.045
Take a close look
at the track record of this company.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.132
And you'll see that we have gambled
in markets

09:10.217 --> 09:12.760
traditionally regarded as nonprofit.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.514
Hospitals, prisons, space exploration.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.310
I say good business is where you find it.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.273
As you know,
we've entered into a contract with the city

09:26.358 --> 09:28.567
to run local law enforcement.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.904
But at Security Concepts,

09:31.988 --> 09:36.033
we believe an efficient police force
is only part of the solution.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.994
No. We need something more.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.373
We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.626
A cop that doesn't need to eat or sleep.

09:46.169 --> 09:50.172
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.093
Fellow executives,

09:54.177 --> 09:58.847
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.769
Ed 209.

10:40.890 --> 10:45.686
The Enforcement Droid series 209
is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.981
209 is currently programmed
for urban pacification,

10:49.065 --> 10:50.816
but that is only the beginning.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.986
After a successful tour of duty
in Old Detroit,

10:54.070 --> 10:58.866
we can expect 209 to become the
hot military product for the next decade.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.161
- Dr. McNamara.
- We'll need an arrest subject.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.495
- Mr. Kinney.
- Yes, sir?

11:03.580 --> 11:04.788
Would you come up
and give us a hand, please?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.165
Yes, sir.

11:06.249 --> 11:11.086
Mr. Kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.423
Mr. Kinney,
use your gun in a threatening manner.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.761
- Point it at Ed 209.
- Yes, sir.

11:27.687 --> 11:32.107
Please put down your weapon.
You have 20 seconds to comply.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.779
I think you'd better do what he says,
Mr. Kinney.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.953
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.206
- You are in direct violation...
- Cut the power! Pull the board!

11:47.290 --> 11:50.709
...of Penal Code 113, Section 9.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.169
You now have five seconds to comply.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.380
Help! Help me!

11:54.464 --> 11:57.049
Four, three, two, one.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.553
I am now authorized to use physical force.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.496
It's horrible.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.665
Somebody want to call
a goddamn paramedic?

12:29.749 --> 12:33.001
- Let's go, Johnson!
- You pull the plug on this thing!

12:34.295 --> 12:36.338
All right, don't touch him.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.257
Don't touch him!

12:38.341 --> 12:39.508
He didn't hear the gun drop.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.926
He didn't hear it?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.262
Oh, God.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.973
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.519
I'm sure it's only a glitch,
a temporary setback.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.521
You call this a glitch?

12:54.315 --> 12:56.608
We're scheduled to begin construction
in six months.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.612
Your temporary setback could cost us
$50 million in interest payments alone.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.406
Not necessarily, sir.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.283
Perhaps you're aware
of the Robocop program

13:04.367 --> 13:06.118
developed by myself at Security Concepts

13:06.202 --> 13:08.287
as a contingency
against just this sort of thing.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.913
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Morton.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.957
I'm sure this is something
we can take up in my office...

13:12.041 --> 13:13.041
Now, wait a minute. Dick!

13:13.209 --> 13:14.918
Get me out of here!

13:16.004 --> 13:19.089
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.301
Tell me about your plan, Mr. Morton.
How long will it take?

13:22.385 --> 13:23.385
We're ready to go, sir.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.137
We've restructured the police department

13:25.221 --> 13:27.306
and placed prime candidates
according to risk factor.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.808
I'm confident that we can go to prototype
within 90 days.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.519
Good, very good.
Get your staff together, Mr. Morton.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.230
I'll expect a full presentation
in 20 minutes.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.399
Thank you, sir.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.908
Yes! Now, that's how it's done
in the big leagues, Johnson.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.452
You see an opening, you go for it.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.748
You better watch your back, Bob.
Jones is going to come looking for you.

13:52.874 --> 13:56.752
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.254
Too bad about Kinney.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.632
That's life in the big city.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.259
When do we start?

14:04.344 --> 14:07.054
As soon as
some poor schmuck volunteers.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.057
Unit 3509, proceed to Hall and Grand.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.017
411 involving indigents.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.436
Roger, we're on our way.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.281
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.785
Yeah, my son, Jimmy,
watches this cop show, TJ Lazer,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.829
and this Lazer guy does this
every time he takes down a bad guy.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.290
So naturally,
my kid thinks every good cop should be...

14:35.375 --> 14:37.292
And you don't want to disappoint him.

14:38.086 --> 14:42.005
Yeah, well, role models
can be very important to a boy.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.889
Okay, okay, I get a kick out of it.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.058
All units, all units, sector 9.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.977
- That's for...
- 211 in progress.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.145
Why don't you drive?

14:57.814 --> 15:01.066
...the suspects are armed
and considered dangerous.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.861
Shit.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.781
I don't believe it!

15:07.865 --> 15:08.949
What?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.243
You burned the fucking money!

15:11.327 --> 15:13.370
I had to blow the door. What do you want?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.455
It's as good as marked, you asshole!

15:15.540 --> 15:17.916
You stupid, stupid asshole!

15:18.001 --> 15:20.586
- Clarence!
- What? What do you want?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.337
We got a cop on our tail.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.430
Come on, man, speed it up! Move it!

15:31.514 --> 15:33.682
This crate ain't gonna outrun a cop.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.351
- Slow down, then.
- What, are you crazy, man?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.354
Shut the fuck up and do it! Just do it!

15:39.439 --> 15:42.316
Central, this is 154.
We're in pursuit of 211 suspect.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.567
Request backup.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.527
Roger, 154.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.196
- Backup currently unavailable.
- Give me your piece.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.782
Backup E.T.A., 15 minutes.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.451
Bobby, get the door!

15:52.702 --> 15:53.785
Everybody load up!

15:53.870 --> 15:55.621
All right, let's go. Come on!

15:55.872 --> 15:58.248
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.588
Now.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.968
What the fuck? Where did he go?

16:10.053 --> 16:11.178
Emil?

16:11.262 --> 16:12.638
Here! He's up here!

16:16.893 --> 16:18.143
He's on the side.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.728
He's over here!

16:27.070 --> 16:28.111
Get him!

16:36.621 --> 16:38.038
Shit, Clarence, my leg!

16:38.122 --> 16:40.374
Leon, pick him up.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.501
- Ready?
- No, hang on.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.628
Bobby.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.507
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no!

16:48.883 --> 16:50.092
Hit it!

16:52.053 --> 16:53.720
No!

17:15.618 --> 17:16.827
Central, this is unit 154.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.496
We located that van by the old mill
in Sector 3D.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.915
- Now, where is that backup?
- Backup is still unavailable.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.417
Oh, man!

17:23.501 --> 17:26.253
We estimate 10 minutes
before units can arrive.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.755
Well, you call it.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.259
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.267
Go.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.602
Stay in touch.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.563
Freeze.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.942
Okay, let's see those hands.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.153
Nice and easy.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.113
Sure.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.283
Mind if I zip this up?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.430
We keep robbing banks,
but we never get to keep the money.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.932
Takes money to make money.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.183
We steal money to buy coke,

19:03.267 --> 19:05.477
then sell the coke
to make even more money.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.603
Capital investment, man.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.356
Yeah, why bother making it
when we can just steal it?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.108
Ain't no better way to
steal money than free enterprise.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.610
- Smoke?
- No.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.196
- You know, those things will kill you.
- Yeah.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.907
You want to live forever?

19:19.742 --> 19:20.867
Bixby!

19:24.830 --> 19:27.874
What a cake! Oh, boy!

19:31.212 --> 19:32.212
Hey.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.047
Don't move.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.136
Go ahead and do it.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.557
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.732
Lewis. Lewis!

19:54.902 --> 19:56.778
Lewis, I got a situation here, girl.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.239
Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!

19:59.323 --> 20:01.700
Turn around.
Spread your legs. That's right.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.245
Lewis, where are you? You all right?

20:07.248 --> 20:09.666
Put your hands on your head. Lewis?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.590
Why don't you let us
take over from here, Emil?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.861
- Your ass is mine.
- No.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.364
Not yet it ain't.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.295
Well, what have we here?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.342
You a good cop, hotshot?

21:02.428 --> 21:04.137
Sure you are.

21:04.680 --> 21:10.185
Why, you got to be some kind of great cop
to come in here all by yourself.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.318
Where's your partner?

21:18.402 --> 21:21.029
Well, guys, the other one was upstairs.

21:21.238 --> 21:25.158
She was sweet, mmm, mmm, mmm.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.701
I took her out.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.458
I bet that really pisses you off.

21:39.256 --> 21:42.092
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.760
Do you?

21:44.178 --> 21:45.845
Buddy, I think you're slime.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.519
You see, I got this problem.

21:53.187 --> 21:57.899
Cops don't like me, so I don't like cops.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.376
Well, give the man a hand.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.089
He's all yours.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.356
- All right, look out.
- Turn around, man.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.734
Pretty boy, over here.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.172
Shit! I'm out of ammo.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.465
Me, too.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.014
Hey Clarence, he's still alive.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.934
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.110
Okay, fun's over.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.451
Okay, let's get out of here.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.079
Good night, sweet prince.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.583
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.399
Murphy.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.298
Get him over. Lift!

24:29.510 --> 24:30.927
Get the ventilator.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.679
Put him in OR 4.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.811
Easy, easy. Turn.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.607
Slow it down now.
Slow it down, slow it down.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.317
Okay, hit the door.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.198
Let me get pressure.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.533
Mask him.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.411
Got a pressure of 60 palp.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.954
All right, we have to
intubate this guy.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.457
Apply cricoid pressure.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.712
Okay. All right, I got it in. Breath sounds.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.006
- You're in.
- Other side.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.634
Okay, let's go ahead
and get the MAST trousers up.

25:11.719 --> 25:12.927
Let's get the clothes off.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.014
Okay, clothes off.
Let's prep him for a central line.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.183
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.814
His pressure's dropping.

25:24.899 --> 25:26.983
Okay, I've got a central line in.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.776
I'm getting pressure back. Normal saline.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.028
Can you do that, Dad?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.617
I really have to tell you something.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.952
- What's our blood pressure?
- I've got 40 palp.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.370
All right.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.463
Coarse V-Fib.
Okay, we got to shock him.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.214
Let's get the Ambu bag.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.966
Clear the patches.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.801
Put the Foley in.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.012
Let's go ahead and blow
his MAST trousers.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.263
Stand clear.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.265
Stand clear. Shock him.

25:59.350 --> 26:00.683
All right.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.645
Coarse V-Fib. Let's shock him again.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.229
Clear.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.107
All right.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.985
Flatline. Let's go intracardiac epinephrine.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.362
Let's go.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.738
Okay.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.325
All right, it's in.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.534
There's no pulse.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.579
All right, let's go ahead
and shock a flat line, and let's quit.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.789
Okay, everybody, clear!

26:22.873 --> 26:23.915
Stand clear.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.840
All right, I think that's all we can do.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.134
Let's call it. What's the time?

26:36.512 --> 26:37.804
15.

26:53.696 --> 26:54.862
Sharp.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.281
No, it's starting to roll.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.118
Still rolling.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.953
- Shit!
- Nope.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.331
Let me see.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.084
Bring in the L.E.D.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.128
Let's lock it down.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.804
- He's on.
- What's the story?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.556
We were able to save the left arm.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.517
What? I thought we agreed
on total body prosthesis.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.311
- Now, lose the arm, okay?
- Jesus, Morton.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.565
Can he understand what I'm saying?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.942
It doesn't matter.
We're gonna blank his memory, anyway.

27:33.027 --> 27:35.611
Well, I think we should lose the arm.
What do you think, Johnson?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.905
Well, he signed the release forms
when he joined the force.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.367
He's legally dead.
We can do pretty much what we want to.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.495
Lose the arm.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.665
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.672
The entire outer skin will be like this.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.883
It's titanium laminated with Kevlar.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.010
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.014
Come here often? How you doing?

28:04.391 --> 28:05.975
Oh, God!

28:07.519 --> 28:08.978
He's got a hell of a grip.

28:09.063 --> 28:13.107
It's 400 foot-pounds.
He could crush every bone in your hand.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.568
All right. Attach it to his shoulder.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.195
I like that.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.703
You are gonna be a bad motherfucker.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.338
Hey, look, look!
He's watching us!

28:35.422 --> 28:36.756
How you doing?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.299
- Hi!
- Hi!

28:40.719 --> 28:41.969
Happy new year!

28:42.054 --> 28:43.304
This is for you.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.975
Happy new year.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.817
We get the best of both worlds.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.402
The fastest reflexes
modern technology has to offer,

28:58.487 --> 29:00.238
onboard computer-assisted memory,

29:00.322 --> 29:03.491
and a lifetime of on-the-street
law enforcement programming.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.702
It is my great pleasure to present to you,

29:08.413 --> 29:09.664
Robocop.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.461
Come on, come on, come on.

29:15.546 --> 29:17.588
Come on. That's for you. That's for you.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.923
Go, Robo.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.194
I am what you call a repeat offender.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.613
I repeat, I will offend again.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.949
I get my orders from a higher source.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.284
Shut up, asshole.

29:46.368 --> 29:49.036
Does your mother know you talk like that?

29:51.582 --> 29:52.874
Bring him in through the side door.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.750
This holding cell
has been set up for observation.

29:54.835 --> 29:55.835
Looks perfect.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.587
- What is this all about?
- Who is this guy?

29:57.671 --> 29:59.505
- Sergeant John Reed.
- What's this all about?

29:59.590 --> 30:03.134
It's about official OCP business.
So please, get lost.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.844
I think we've got four or five days setup...

30:04.928 --> 30:08.306
Hey, this is bullshit!
I take my orders from...

30:25.449 --> 30:27.408
What is this shit?

30:27.743 --> 30:28.826
Yeah, good question.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.580
- Hey, wait for me, partner.
- Let's go.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.498
There they are.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Go.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.806
When you are at rest,
you will sit in the chair.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.600
Yes. I understand.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.352
What about tracking?

30:54.478 --> 30:57.021
We can check his exact location
at all times with one of these.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.191
How does he eat?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.401
His digestive system is extremely simple.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.528
This processor dispenses
a rudimentary paste

31:04.613 --> 31:06.906
that sustains his organic system.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.791
Tastes like baby food.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.044
Knock yourself out.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.214
Mmm.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.640
Okay, let's start with tracking.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.808
- Give me a grid.
- Got it.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.934
There.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.060
- Target?
- Check.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.479
- Target.
- Check.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.897
Now follow.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.235
Check.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.822
Voice stress analyzer, one, two...

31:47.906 --> 31:48.990
Ahhh.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.283
...three.
- Ahhh.

31:50.367 --> 31:51.325
- Check.
- Record.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.410
Ahhh.

31:52.661 --> 31:56.998
- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50%.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.249
Give me a full frame.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.084
- We got it.
- All right, clear out.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.546
What are your prime directives?

32:04.131 --> 32:08.259
Serve the public trust,
protect the innocent, uphold the law.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.264
That's good.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.016
That's very good.

32:17.853 --> 32:18.894
Huh?

32:24.026 --> 32:25.401
I fucking love that guy!

33:03.231 --> 33:04.732
Hey, Lewis, it's Supercop.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.776
Look at that fucking gun.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.793
Shit!

33:24.753 --> 33:27.588
- This guy's really good.
- He's not a guy. He's a machine.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.590
What are they gonna do, replace us?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.474
Come on.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.147
- Reed.
- Yeah?

33:45.232 --> 33:46.607
He needs a car.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.735
Thank you.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.863
Sure. Anytime.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.741
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy!

34:29.985 --> 34:32.027
I'd buy that for a dollar!

34:45.584 --> 34:47.543
Will there be anything else, sir?

34:47.627 --> 34:50.254
Yeah, empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.672
Excuse me?

34:52.048 --> 34:55.593
I said give me your money and all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

34:55.677 --> 34:56.927
Now move!

34:57.929 --> 34:59.388
Open the safe, Pops.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.266
Open the goddamn safe!

35:02.350 --> 35:03.893
We don't have a safe.

35:03.977 --> 35:07.813
Shit! There's your goddamn safe!
Open that son of a bitch!

35:07.898 --> 35:09.773
Quit stalling, man!
I'm gonna count to three!

35:09.858 --> 35:11.192
You better open that son of a bitch.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.735
Come on! Come on!

35:12.819 --> 35:14.862
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.991
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.326
Come on.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.370
Well, you better open that
on the count of three.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.581
One, two...

35:28.293 --> 35:29.668
Fuck me.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.713
Drop the gun. You are under arrest.

35:34.424 --> 35:41.931
Fuck me! Fuck me!

35:42.641 --> 35:43.849
Fuck me!

35:54.653 --> 35:57.780
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.158
I'll buy that for a dollar!

36:18.677 --> 36:21.387
Don't touch me! Get away! Get away!

36:21.471 --> 36:23.055
We don't want your bag!

36:23.181 --> 36:24.598
We want you!

36:26.726 --> 36:29.812
Take it easy! We don't want to hurt you!

36:29.896 --> 36:30.938
That's too much hair.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.357
I know, we'll give her a haircut!

36:37.237 --> 36:38.445
- Hey, hey.
- What?

36:38.530 --> 36:41.615
There's more hair down there!

36:44.244 --> 36:46.120
No, don't!

36:48.999 --> 36:50.207
Please!

36:51.001 --> 36:52.209
No!

36:52.502 --> 36:56.380
Help me!

36:57.132 --> 36:59.508
Let the woman go. You are under arrest.

36:59.593 --> 37:00.718
Shit!

37:01.803 --> 37:03.387
You better back up, pal!

37:03.471 --> 37:05.389
'Cause, he's gonna kill her!

37:05.473 --> 37:07.266
He's gonna kill her!

37:07.350 --> 37:09.226
You fucking bitch!

37:09.311 --> 37:11.145
He's gonna kill her, man!

37:11.229 --> 37:13.105
He's gonna kill her!

37:21.489 --> 37:23.115
Your move, creep.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.366
Okay!

37:25.076 --> 37:26.285
It's okay!

37:31.750 --> 37:34.877
I was so scared. Thank you.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.587
Thank you.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.216
Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.844
I will notify a rape crisis center.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.817
All units, Sector 6,
please close intersections...

38:05.200 --> 38:07.368
I don't care.
Get those men by the stairs now!

38:07.452 --> 38:08.702
Hit it!

38:11.414 --> 38:14.541
Terrorism has never been
a factor in city politics before.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.503
But that changed today
when former city councilman Ron Miller

38:17.587 --> 38:19.254
entered City Hall with a gun.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.714
He's now on the second floor

38:20.799 --> 38:23.384
holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

38:23.468 --> 38:27.304
We do believe
that Miller has killed one of the hostages.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.431
Lieutenant, what's next?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.684
We wait.
Terrorism is a very tricky business.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.894
Maximum and immediate retaliation
is the best policy.

38:33.978 --> 38:34.978
But unfortunately...

38:36.147 --> 38:37.189
Excuse us.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.066
Where are you going?

38:41.486 --> 38:42.820
Statement, please.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.786
Let's have some crowd control!
Come on, get these people back!

38:50.870 --> 38:52.705
Where the hell do you think you're going?

38:52.789 --> 38:54.540
Keep him talking.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.503
Who made you?

39:00.171 --> 39:01.964
Are you invincible?

39:05.719 --> 39:09.930
Okay, Miller, don't hurt the Mayor.
We'll give you whatever you want.

39:10.223 --> 39:13.726
First, don't fuck with me!
I'm a desperate man!

39:14.853 --> 39:17.604
And second, I want some fresh coffee!

39:18.565 --> 39:20.566
And third, I want a recount!

39:20.650 --> 39:23.986
And no matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back!

39:24.070 --> 39:25.279
Okay.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.448
And I want a bigger office!

39:27.949 --> 39:29.700
And I want a new car!

39:29.784 --> 39:31.618
And I want the City to pay for it all!

39:31.703 --> 39:33.912
What kind of car, Miller?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.956
Something with reclining leather seats,

39:36.040 --> 39:38.959
that goes really fast and gets
really shitty gas mileage!

39:39.043 --> 39:42.045
How about the 6000 SUX?

39:42.797 --> 39:45.382
Yeah! Okay, sure!

39:47.051 --> 39:50.262
What about cruise control?
Does it come with cruise control?

39:50.346 --> 39:55.267
Hey, no problem, Miller. Let the Mayor go,
we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.313
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

39:59.397 --> 40:02.316
When people jerk me off, I kill them!

40:02.400 --> 40:04.026
You want to see?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.991
Get up, Your Honor, get up. Get up!

40:11.075 --> 40:12.659
Your public wants to see you!

40:14.496 --> 40:16.663
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

40:17.499 --> 40:19.291
We'll get serious now!

40:19.375 --> 40:21.460
And kiss the Mayor's ass good-bye!

40:32.972 --> 40:35.057
Robocop. Who is he?

40:35.141 --> 40:37.601
What is he? Where does he come from?

40:37.811 --> 40:40.020
He's OCP's newest soldier

40:40.104 --> 40:42.564
in their revolutionary
crime management program.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.192
OCP Spokesmen claim
that the fearless machine

40:45.276 --> 40:47.361
has crooks on the run in Old Detroit.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.863
Today, kids at Lee lacocca
Elementary School

40:49.948 --> 40:51.281
got to meet in person

40:51.366 --> 40:54.243
what their parents only
read about in comic books.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.703
Robo, excuse me, Robo.
Any special message

40:56.788 --> 40:58.789
for all the kids watching at home?

41:00.291 --> 41:02.125
Stay out of trouble.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.546
More fighting in the Mexican crisis today

41:05.630 --> 41:08.131
when American troops
participated in a joint raid

41:08.216 --> 41:09.299
with Mexican nationals

41:09.384 --> 41:12.010
against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.

41:12.637 --> 41:13.637
Now this.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.265
Red alert. Red alert.
Red alert.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.977
You crossed my line of death.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.396
You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.523
Pakistan is threatening my border.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.317
That's it, buster. No more military aid.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.948
Nukem, get them
before they get you.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.913
Today, labor leaders agreed
to sanction construction

41:39.998 --> 41:41.540
of OCP's Delta City,

41:41.624 --> 41:44.835
thereby creating an estimated one million
much-needed new jobs,

41:44.919 --> 41:48.672
despite questions about worker safety
in dangerous Old Detroit.

41:48.756 --> 41:52.384
Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.553
I'm afraid I can't comment on Delta City.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.179
That's not my division.
But I will tell you this.

41:56.556 --> 41:59.349
At Security Concepts,
we're projecting the end of crime

41:59.559 --> 42:01.768
in Old Detroit within 40 days.

42:02.312 --> 42:04.897
There's a new guy in town.
His name's Robocop.

42:08.109 --> 42:11.695
Hey, hey, hey. Bobby boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

42:11.779 --> 42:12.988
Handball Tuesday night?

42:13.072 --> 42:15.490
Bill, I'd love to. But I got a date.

42:15.575 --> 42:17.784
Couple models coming
over to my place. Know what I mean?

42:17.869 --> 42:19.745
I'd buy that for a dollar.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.000
Welcome to the club, Bob.

42:26.586 --> 42:28.211
...and that's a true story.

42:29.130 --> 42:32.841
Making a real name for yourself
in Security Concepts with Robocop.

42:32.926 --> 42:34.384
I try.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.470
I'm in on the bottom line, pal.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.097
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

42:39.182 --> 42:42.684
Oh, you know, he's got this killer rep,
but it's a smokescreen.

42:44.145 --> 42:46.813
Let's face it, he's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.649
Are we talking
about the same Dick Jones?

42:48.733 --> 42:51.860
Hey, he's old, we're young, and that's life.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.789
I got to...

43:04.582 --> 43:06.750
I got to go. I got a meeting.

43:17.387 --> 43:18.679
Congratulations, Bob.

43:19.639 --> 43:20.847
Thanks.

43:21.641 --> 43:25.060
I remember when I was
a young executive for this company.

43:25.645 --> 43:27.938
I used to call the old man funny names.

43:28.523 --> 43:29.564
Iron Butt,

43:30.608 --> 43:31.692
Boner.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.613
Once, I even called him asshole.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.454
But there was always respect.

43:45.373 --> 43:48.083
I always knew where the line was drawn.

43:49.794 --> 43:52.838
And you just stepped over it, buddy boy.

43:54.215 --> 43:58.010
You've insulted me,
and you've insulted this company

43:58.094 --> 43:59.594
with that bastard creation of yours!

43:59.679 --> 44:03.056
I had a guaranteed military sale
with Ed 209!

44:03.141 --> 44:07.019
Renovation program.
Spare parts for 25 years.

44:07.103 --> 44:09.730
Who cares if it worked or not?

44:11.315 --> 44:13.608
The old man thought
it was pretty important,

44:13.735 --> 44:14.818
Dick.

44:22.702 --> 44:26.455
You know, he's a sweet old man.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.334
And he means well.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.589
But he's not going to live forever.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.676
And I'm number two around here.

44:41.179 --> 44:43.346
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.851
You just

44:49.020 --> 44:51.521
fucked with the wrong guy.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.899
You're out of your fucking mind.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.822
You better pray

45:01.616 --> 45:04.951
that that unholy monster of yours
doesn't screw up.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.973
- You hungry?
- No, thanks.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.517
No.

46:15.982 --> 46:18.859
Goddamn rebels blew up the airport
in Acapulco yesterday.

46:18.943 --> 46:21.820
Great. We were going there next week.
Wait, what was that?

46:28.161 --> 46:30.579
Hey, look! Bucket boy's online.

46:48.389 --> 46:51.516
Halt. Stop! Wait a minute!

46:51.934 --> 46:53.351
What the hell's going on?

46:53.436 --> 46:55.937
- I don't know. He just left.
- Just left?

46:57.648 --> 46:58.982
Roosevelt!

46:59.817 --> 47:01.818
Rosie, we got a problem.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.448
Out of the way!

47:06.824 --> 47:08.617
Take a look at this.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.496
Shit! Call Bob Morton!

47:23.633 --> 47:26.635
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

47:31.724 --> 47:35.518
Hello. I haven't really had a chance
to introduce myself.

47:36.062 --> 47:37.604
I'm Anne Lewis.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.941
Do you have a name?

47:47.406 --> 47:49.866
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

47:51.410 --> 47:55.038
That's not really what I meant.
Don't you have a name?

47:55.414 --> 47:56.957
Hold it. Just sign right here, sir.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.667
You don't understand.
I'm OCP.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.587
Murphy, it's you.

48:07.969 --> 48:10.345
You really don't remember me, do you?

48:10.429 --> 48:11.763
Excuse me.

48:12.181 --> 48:13.640
I have to go.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.476
Somewhere there is a crime happening.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.644
Stop!

48:19.230 --> 48:21.815
What did you talk to him about?
What did you say?

48:21.899 --> 48:23.316
- Nothing.
- Shit.

48:23.401 --> 48:24.484
Shit.

48:27.363 --> 48:28.488
Stop!

48:28.572 --> 48:30.198
You there, stop!

48:35.871 --> 48:39.374
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer!
Come on!

48:41.085 --> 48:43.837
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct, buddy,

48:43.921 --> 48:45.797
and if it gets screwed up
by one of your grunts,

48:45.881 --> 48:46.965
I'm gonna have your job.

48:47.049 --> 48:48.842
- What's the update?
- It's hard to be 100%.

48:48.926 --> 48:49.968
We have a glitch or what?

48:50.052 --> 48:52.846
This system was never designed
to experience detailed somatic response.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.806
He had a dream, a dream.

48:55.099 --> 48:58.143
- This cop saw fit to question him.
- I didn't question him.

48:58.227 --> 49:00.395
I asked him his name. He didn't know.

49:00.479 --> 49:03.315
Great. Let me make it real clear for you.

49:03.399 --> 49:05.775
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.069
He's product. Is that clear?

49:08.446 --> 49:09.487
Sure.

49:09.572 --> 49:11.406
I say we pull him in, run a systems check,
the works.

49:11.490 --> 49:12.699
Take a week. Maybe 10 days.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.868
You want to take him offline
because he had a dream?

49:14.952 --> 49:16.202
What, are you kidding?

49:16.454 --> 49:18.246
Let's get out of here.

49:18.664 --> 49:19.748
- Listen, Reed.
- Yeah?

49:19.832 --> 49:23.793
Try to keep one thing in mind.
This project doesn't concern cops.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.421
It's classified. It's OCP.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.465
You got it, mister?

49:31.177 --> 49:32.719
Yeah, I got it.

49:33.137 --> 49:34.220
Good.

49:34.930 --> 49:36.431
Right, we keep him on the street...

49:36.515 --> 49:37.974
Sorry, Sarge.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.101
I fucked up.

49:42.063 --> 49:44.606
Forget it, kid. This guy's a serious asshole.

50:17.348 --> 50:20.517
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.608
Now fill it up on number 7.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.991
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

50:39.203 --> 50:40.495
I'm a good shot.

50:43.249 --> 50:44.916
I could hit you in the eye from here.

50:56.762 --> 50:59.222
Hey, man, what you reading in there?

51:05.354 --> 51:08.231
You a college boy or something?

51:10.234 --> 51:12.777
I bet you think you're pretty smart?

51:13.237 --> 51:15.488
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

51:15.656 --> 51:17.782
What do you say we find out?

51:18.367 --> 51:20.368
I'm talking to you! What do you say?

51:22.037 --> 51:23.746
I'm talking to you!

51:25.875 --> 51:27.083
Drop it.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.798
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.304
I know you.

51:40.931 --> 51:41.931
You're dead.

51:43.225 --> 51:47.395
We killed you!

51:50.024 --> 51:51.524
We killed you!

52:02.870 --> 52:04.120
You're dead.

52:05.039 --> 52:06.206
We killed you!

52:51.794 --> 52:53.253
Who are you?

52:56.048 --> 52:58.383
Who are you?

53:11.188 --> 53:12.772
Jerry, Jerry. Look who it is.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.566
Can I help you, sir?

53:15.150 --> 53:18.403
- No.
- What is it exactly that you want?

53:20.322 --> 53:23.366
You can't enter here! Wait a second!

53:23.450 --> 53:25.034
Just a minute!

53:25.536 --> 53:28.454
This is a restricted area!

53:36.880 --> 53:37.922
He's in.

54:34.355 --> 54:36.689
Murphy, it's you.

54:36.774 --> 54:43.946
Murphy, it's you.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.003
Welcome, shopper.

55:41.088 --> 55:43.673
Let's take a stroll through your new home.

55:43.757 --> 55:46.968
This is a one-family house
built by ZEM Industries.

55:47.052 --> 55:49.262
Situated near schools
and shopping centers,

55:49.346 --> 55:52.765
this progressive development
has a growth factor of 7.

56:14.663 --> 56:15.872
Wow.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.791
Can you do that, Dad?

56:28.010 --> 56:30.928
And, say, it doesn't matter
who cooks in your family,

56:31.013 --> 56:35.641
because this kitchen by Food Concepts
makes everything a snap.

56:55.579 --> 56:56.621
Dad.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.419
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

57:03.504 --> 57:04.796
Get in the picture.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.172
Come on, come on.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.858
I really have to tell you something.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.072
I love you.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.120
That's the master bedroom.

57:38.205 --> 57:42.416
A functional space
with a touch of elegance.

57:42.626 --> 57:44.794
Have you thought it all over?

57:45.087 --> 57:47.088
Why not make me an offer?

58:20.080 --> 58:22.248
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

58:28.630 --> 58:29.672
Okay?

58:36.722 --> 58:38.514
- Shit!
- Let's talk.

58:43.270 --> 58:45.021
Son of a bitch!

58:49.568 --> 58:51.986
There's just something
about the way it sounds.

58:53.488 --> 58:54.906
Vice president.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.742
It just turns me on.

58:58.368 --> 58:59.869
God, you girls are so great.

58:59.953 --> 59:02.663
I mean I just...
I love to be with intelligent women.

59:02.748 --> 59:05.291
Smart is so sexy.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.168
I know.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.795
Sometimes I could
just think of something,

59:10.380 --> 59:14.008
and it could just get me so horny.

59:15.802 --> 59:19.180
Yeah, well,
a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

59:19.264 --> 59:20.640
Yeah.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.516
I get bored so easily.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.102
Yep.

59:25.604 --> 59:28.314
And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.

59:30.233 --> 59:33.277
- Yes, I do. Don't move.
- I won't.

59:36.615 --> 59:37.907
Bob?

59:38.742 --> 59:39.867
What?

59:40.243 --> 59:43.454
- Bob, save some for me.
- Don't worry. I'll...

59:47.376 --> 59:49.794
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

59:56.134 --> 59:57.426
How you doing...

59:59.805 --> 1:00:01.347
Bitches, leave.

1:00:04.059 --> 1:00:06.060
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

1:00:06.895 --> 1:00:09.563
- You gonna call me?
- Come on.

1:00:09.648 --> 1:00:11.857
What the fuck are you doing?

1:00:11.942 --> 1:00:13.651
Do you know who I am?

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:16.487
If you think you're gonna
get away with this...

1:00:19.533 --> 1:00:20.950
Goddamn it!

1:00:24.413 --> 1:00:29.458
Stop! I'll give you anything you want!
Just please, please don't kill me, all right?

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:36.924
Hello, buddy boy. Dick Jones here.

1:00:38.051 --> 1:00:42.138
I guess you're on your knees about now,
begging for your life.

1:00:43.807 --> 1:00:44.974
Pathetic.

1:00:45.225 --> 1:00:47.393
You don't feel so cocky now, do you, Bob?

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:50.479
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it right now.

1:00:50.605 --> 1:00:53.232
You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:57.069
We could have been friends.

1:00:57.154 --> 1:01:00.156
But you wouldn't go
through proper channels.

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:02.116
You went over my head.

1:01:03.827 --> 1:01:05.161
That hurt.

1:01:05.662 --> 1:01:10.499
But life goes on. It's an old story,
the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?

1:01:12.169 --> 1:01:15.171
It helps if you think of it as a game, Bob.

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:19.842
Every game has a winner and a loser.

1:01:28.351 --> 1:01:31.812
I'm cashing you out, Bob.

1:01:47.496 --> 1:01:48.871
We need more tubing.

1:01:53.919 --> 1:01:56.712
I don't think I want to
pay you that, Sal.

1:01:57.547 --> 1:02:01.634
I don't give a shit
what you want to pay. I set the prices here.

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:05.763
Listen, pal, maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy in Old Detroit.

1:02:06.264 --> 1:02:08.307
You want space in my marketplace,

1:02:08.391 --> 1:02:11.185
you're gonna have
to give me a volume discount.

1:02:11.269 --> 1:02:13.813
I'm not into discounts.

1:02:13.897 --> 1:02:17.233
Joe, show the man
what we brought him for Christmas.

1:02:25.283 --> 1:02:28.911
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

1:02:35.585 --> 1:02:38.420
Okay, let me try to put this in perspective.

1:02:39.881 --> 1:02:41.799
You killed a bunch of cops.

1:02:42.634 --> 1:02:46.762
The word around is that you've got
a lot of heavy connections downtown.

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:50.349
You make a lot of my friends nervous.

1:02:53.728 --> 1:02:57.773
A lot of people
would love to see a guy like me

1:02:58.483 --> 1:03:00.651
put a guy like you out of business.

1:03:01.444 --> 1:03:03.946
I don't know. I don't know.

1:03:04.614 --> 1:03:07.074
Maybe I'm just not making myself clear.

1:03:09.995 --> 1:03:12.454
I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

1:03:13.957 --> 1:03:18.043
But I got the connections.
I got the sales organization.

1:03:18.879 --> 1:03:21.672
I got the muscle
to shove enough of this factory

1:03:21.756 --> 1:03:26.802
so far up your stupid wop ass
that you'll shit snow for a year.

1:03:26.887 --> 1:03:29.638
Frankie, blow this cocksucker's head off.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.975
Guns, guns, guns!

1:03:35.478 --> 1:03:36.854
Come on, Sal!

1:03:36.938 --> 1:03:39.523
The Tigers are playing tonight.

1:03:41.359 --> 1:03:43.152
I never miss a game.

1:03:48.992 --> 1:03:50.451
Just kidding.

1:04:03.506 --> 1:04:04.506
Go!

1:04:09.304 --> 1:04:10.346
Go.

1:04:27.906 --> 1:04:31.575
Come quietly or there will be trouble.

1:04:33.578 --> 1:04:34.787
Fuck you!

1:06:10.467 --> 1:06:14.470
Clarence Boddicker, you are under arrest.

1:06:14.554 --> 1:06:16.305
You have the right to remain silent.

1:06:17.515 --> 1:06:18.682
Fuck you!

1:06:24.397 --> 1:06:27.066
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

1:06:27.150 --> 1:06:29.443
I'm protected, man. I've got protection!

1:06:29.527 --> 1:06:31.070
You have the right to an attorney.

1:06:31.154 --> 1:06:32.905
What is this shit?

1:06:37.369 --> 1:06:38.744
Goddamn it.

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:40.829
Goddamn it! Listen to me!

1:06:41.289 --> 1:06:44.500
Listen to me, you fuck!
There's another guy.

1:06:44.626 --> 1:06:47.336
He's OCP. He's a senior president.

1:06:47.754 --> 1:06:50.964
Anything you say
may be used against you.

1:06:51.049 --> 1:06:52.883
It's Dick Jones!

1:06:57.430 --> 1:07:00.641
Don't you get it? You cocksucker!

1:07:00.725 --> 1:07:04.353
I work for Dick Jones. Dick Jones!

1:07:04.938 --> 1:07:09.108
He's the number two guy at OCP.
OCP runs the cops!

1:07:10.527 --> 1:07:12.361
You're a cop.

1:07:15.698 --> 1:07:17.241
Cop.

1:07:27.544 --> 1:07:30.212
Yes. I am a cop.

1:07:34.175 --> 1:07:36.760
I don't like it any more
than you do, Reed, but listen!

1:07:36.845 --> 1:07:38.303
You listen to me, you asshole!

1:07:38.388 --> 1:07:42.391
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force.

1:07:42.475 --> 1:07:45.644
Without cops,
this city would tear itself apart.

1:07:45.728 --> 1:07:48.647
The Union thinks you should know
there was a strike vote last night.

1:07:48.731 --> 1:07:50.357
We lost five guys last week.

1:07:50.442 --> 1:07:52.443
We're getting creamed out there, Reed.

1:08:01.870 --> 1:08:03.120
Book him.

1:08:03.413 --> 1:08:04.913
What's the charge?

1:08:08.877 --> 1:08:10.544
He's a cop killer.

1:08:17.135 --> 1:08:18.427
Shit!

1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:21.388
Just give me my fucking phone call.

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:30.272
I understand.

1:08:30.356 --> 1:08:32.399
Look, the lawyers will
have you out in 24 hours.

1:08:32.484 --> 1:08:34.359
Just don't say anything else.

1:08:35.445 --> 1:08:37.613
Jesus, you really screwed up.

1:09:40.385 --> 1:09:43.637
Don't you get it?
I work for Dick Jones!

1:09:43.888 --> 1:09:45.264
Dick Jones!

1:09:47.850 --> 1:09:49.935
I work for Dick Jones!

1:09:50.019 --> 1:09:53.313
He runs OCP. OCP runs the cops.

1:09:58.027 --> 1:09:59.653
Come in, Officer.

1:09:59.821 --> 1:10:02.281
You know, I don't usually see
anyone without an appointment,

1:10:02.365 --> 1:10:04.116
but in your case, I'll make an exception.

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.034
You are under arrest.

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:07.911
On what charge?

1:10:07.996 --> 1:10:10.163
Aiding and abetting a known felon.

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:13.709
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

1:10:15.587 --> 1:10:16.795
You better take me in.

1:10:16.879 --> 1:10:18.171
I will.

1:10:31.686 --> 1:10:33.395
What's the matter, Officer?

1:10:36.482 --> 1:10:38.817
I'll tell you what's the matter.

1:10:38.901 --> 1:10:42.446
It's a little insurance policy
called Directive 4.

1:10:42.530 --> 1:10:45.741
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

1:10:47.327 --> 1:10:50.287
Any attempt to arrest
a senior officer of OCP

1:10:50.371 --> 1:10:52.205
results in shutdown.

1:10:55.335 --> 1:10:57.085
What did you think?

1:10:58.463 --> 1:11:01.173
That you were an ordinary police officer?

1:11:01.257 --> 1:11:03.008
You're our product.

1:11:03.259 --> 1:11:07.346
And we can't very well have our products
turning against us, can we?

1:11:11.017 --> 1:11:13.226
Still a little fight left in you.

1:11:18.816 --> 1:11:21.485
Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.

1:11:27.450 --> 1:11:30.577
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

1:11:30.662 --> 1:11:33.205
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:47.529
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line.
There's trouble in the tower!

1:13:58.893 --> 1:14:00.393
Prepare to fire.

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:04.231
- Hey, wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sakes!

1:14:04.315 --> 1:14:07.275
- Hedgecock! You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it.

1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:09.736
- Oh, shit!
- You're maniacs!

1:14:09.862 --> 1:14:11.446
Fire at will.

1:14:29.715 --> 1:14:31.132
Move in.

1:15:28.691 --> 1:15:30.066
Murphy!

1:15:30.776 --> 1:15:32.360
Murphy, it's me.

1:15:35.573 --> 1:15:36.865
Lewis.

1:15:47.668 --> 1:15:48.793
Move down!

1:15:48.878 --> 1:15:50.462
On the next level.

1:15:51.047 --> 1:15:53.590
Lieutenant!
Level 3, level 3. He's on level 3!

1:15:53.716 --> 1:15:55.133
Over here! Over here!

1:15:55.217 --> 1:15:56.760
Open fire!

1:16:14.779 --> 1:16:16.112
It's back.

1:16:17.031 --> 1:16:19.449
Big is back, because bigger is better.

1:16:19.533 --> 1:16:20.784
6000 SUX.

1:16:23.746 --> 1:16:26.665
Good evening.
I'm Jesse Perkins with Casey Wong.

1:16:26.749 --> 1:16:28.750
Top story, Santa Barbara.

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:32.837
10,000 acres of wooded residential land
were scorched in an instant

1:16:32.922 --> 1:16:36.591
when a laser cannon aboard
the strategic defense peace platform

1:16:36.676 --> 1:16:39.177
misfired today
during routine start-up tests.

1:16:39.261 --> 1:16:40.220
Casey.

1:16:40.304 --> 1:16:41.680
Yes, it was a day of mourning

1:16:41.764 --> 1:16:45.016
for the families of 113 people
known dead at this hour,

1:16:45.101 --> 1:16:47.352
among them,
two former United States Presidents

1:16:47.436 --> 1:16:49.896
who had retired in the Santa Barbara area.

1:16:49.981 --> 1:16:51.982
A day of mourning for a country.

1:16:52.149 --> 1:16:56.194
Police union representatives and OCP
continue negotiations today

1:16:56.278 --> 1:16:59.698
in hopes of averting a citywide strike
by police,

1:16:59.782 --> 1:17:02.367
scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.

1:17:02.451 --> 1:17:04.202
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

1:17:04.286 --> 1:17:07.330
They're still on duty,
but what about tomorrow?

1:17:07.415 --> 1:17:10.750
That's the question we put to people
in the crime-plagued Lexington area.

1:17:10.835 --> 1:17:14.045
They're public servants.
They got job security.

1:17:14.130 --> 1:17:15.880
They're not supposed to strike.

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:16.965
It's a free society,

1:17:18.092 --> 1:17:19.759
except there ain't nothin' free

1:17:19.844 --> 1:17:21.594
'cause there's no guarantees, you know?

1:17:21.679 --> 1:17:23.513
You're on your own.

1:17:23.597 --> 1:17:25.181
It's the law of the jungle.

1:17:28.853 --> 1:17:30.687
Be very careful.

1:17:30.771 --> 1:17:32.147
Excuse me, please.

1:17:33.482 --> 1:17:35.942
They must be remodeling.

1:17:40.823 --> 1:17:42.365
Hiya, Barbara.

1:17:43.993 --> 1:17:46.494
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

1:17:46.954 --> 1:17:49.789
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

1:17:50.082 --> 1:17:52.959
Maybe you could fit me in.

1:17:54.962 --> 1:17:57.422
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

1:18:00.926 --> 1:18:02.343
You can keep the gum.

1:18:05.306 --> 1:18:06.848
- This looks good.
- Get a measurement on that.

1:18:06.932 --> 1:18:07.932
Bring a hammer, too.

1:18:10.019 --> 1:18:12.312
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

1:18:12.688 --> 1:18:14.522
That thing is still alive.

1:18:15.024 --> 1:18:16.608
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:18:16.692 --> 1:18:20.028
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

1:18:20.112 --> 1:18:24.699
Hey. Take a look at my face, Dick.

1:18:25.701 --> 1:18:27.660
He was trying to kill me.

1:18:27.745 --> 1:18:29.746
He's a cyborg, you idiot.

1:18:31.207 --> 1:18:33.541
He recorded every word you said.

1:18:33.751 --> 1:18:36.336
His memory's admissible as evidence.

1:18:37.046 --> 1:18:38.296
You involved me.

1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:42.383
You're gonna have to kill it.

1:18:45.971 --> 1:18:47.722
Listen, chief.

1:18:49.016 --> 1:18:51.601
Your company built the fucking thing.

1:18:52.394 --> 1:18:54.395
Now I got to deal with it?

1:18:54.814 --> 1:18:57.357
I don't have time for this bullshit.

1:18:58.067 --> 1:18:59.484
Suit yourself, Clarence.

1:18:59.568 --> 1:19:01.986
But Delta City begins construction
in two months.

1:19:02.071 --> 1:19:04.239
That's 2 million workers living in trailers.

1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:08.618
That means drugs, gambling, prostitution.

1:19:09.578 --> 1:19:13.623
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

1:19:14.291 --> 1:19:16.543
One man could control it all,

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:18.545
Clarence.

1:19:19.672 --> 1:19:22.465
I guess we're gonna be friends after all,

1:19:23.467 --> 1:19:24.717
Richard.

1:19:32.226 --> 1:19:33.268
Destroy it.

1:19:35.271 --> 1:19:37.522
Gonna need some major firepower.

1:19:40.317 --> 1:19:42.277
You got access to military weaponry?

1:19:43.946 --> 1:19:46.281
We practically are the military.

1:20:24.570 --> 1:20:26.237
Did you bring the gun?

1:20:26.322 --> 1:20:27.614
The precinct was deserted.

1:20:27.698 --> 1:20:30.158
Half the force
didn't show up for work today.

1:20:30.242 --> 1:20:32.243
Everyone else walks out at midnight.

1:20:32.328 --> 1:20:33.912
I guess we're on strike.

1:20:33.996 --> 1:20:37.665
I wasn't sure what you needed.
I sort of grabbed things.

1:20:40.336 --> 1:20:41.628
Your gun.

1:20:43.130 --> 1:20:44.839
You asked for this?

1:20:48.802 --> 1:20:50.595
I brought you some food.

1:20:52.181 --> 1:20:54.766
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

1:21:18.290 --> 1:21:21.125
You may not like what you're going to see.

1:21:55.577 --> 1:21:58.413
It's really good to see you again, Murphy.

1:22:03.210 --> 1:22:06.379
Murphy had a wife and son.
What happened to them?

1:22:07.756 --> 1:22:11.050
After the funeral, she moved away.

1:22:11.468 --> 1:22:13.177
Where did they go?

1:22:14.930 --> 1:22:18.141
She thought you were dead.
She started over again.

1:22:21.270 --> 1:22:22.937
I can feel them.

1:22:27.151 --> 1:22:29.277
But I can't remember them.

1:22:35.117 --> 1:22:36.617
Leave me alone.

1:23:23.874 --> 1:23:26.834
Happy birthday, Dave.
She's from me.

1:23:28.670 --> 1:23:31.214
Well, can I have you both?

1:23:32.007 --> 1:23:35.009
- Sure. We've had our shots.
- Sure. We've had our shots.

1:23:36.887 --> 1:23:38.930
I'd buy that for a dollar!

1:23:44.853 --> 1:23:46.270
Hey, Emil.

1:23:46.355 --> 1:23:48.231
How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

1:23:48.315 --> 1:23:50.650
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.

1:23:50.734 --> 1:23:52.110
Nobody popped my cherry.

1:23:52.194 --> 1:23:54.362
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

1:23:54.446 --> 1:23:55.780
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1:23:55.864 --> 1:23:57.782
First they let me out of jail for free,

1:23:57.866 --> 1:24:00.618
then what do I find
in the prison parking lot

1:24:00.702 --> 1:24:03.121
but a brand new 6000 SUX.

1:24:03.205 --> 1:24:05.123
Still got the factory sticker on it!

1:24:05.207 --> 1:24:06.791
Clarence.

1:24:06.875 --> 1:24:09.085
Joey's got a car just like yours, man.

1:24:10.045 --> 1:24:12.713
Yo, Clarence, what do you think, buddy?

1:24:18.929 --> 1:24:20.471
What do you got there, Clarence?

1:24:20.556 --> 1:24:22.056
Wait up for me!

1:24:22.141 --> 1:24:26.227
Whoa! A new toy! Can I play?

1:24:28.814 --> 1:24:30.273
Watch this.

1:24:30.357 --> 1:24:32.859
Wait... Wait a minute, Clarence, Clarence!

1:24:34.278 --> 1:24:36.070
Shit!

1:24:38.532 --> 1:24:39.615
What the fuck?

1:24:39.700 --> 1:24:41.659
- Nice car, Joe.
- Fuck you, Clarence.

1:24:41.743 --> 1:24:42.785
Let me try that.

1:24:42.870 --> 1:24:46.789
Cobra Assault Cannon. State of the art.
Bang! Bang!

1:24:53.797 --> 1:24:55.339
I like it!

1:24:56.216 --> 1:24:58.134
Give it up, faggot. Let a man...

1:24:58.218 --> 1:24:59.552
No, butthole! Get your own!

1:24:59.636 --> 1:25:00.887
Come on!

1:25:07.269 --> 1:25:08.811
Get the other gun, Emil!

1:25:10.439 --> 1:25:11.898
No car is safe!

1:25:11.982 --> 1:25:13.149
Do it, Emil!

1:25:20.491 --> 1:25:21.991
Heads up, you guys.

1:25:31.710 --> 1:25:33.878
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

1:25:33.962 --> 1:25:36.714
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

1:25:36.798 --> 1:25:39.175
Come on, Emil!
Get your ass in the van!

1:25:39.259 --> 1:25:40.968
Come on, lard ass, let's move it!

1:25:41.053 --> 1:25:43.137
I'll get you, faggot!

1:26:37.442 --> 1:26:38.609
What are you doing?

1:26:40.487 --> 1:26:42.738
My targeting system is a little messed up.

1:26:45.784 --> 1:26:47.326
Can I help you?

1:26:48.370 --> 1:26:49.704
Aim for me.

1:27:00.757 --> 1:27:02.383
Are you locked in now?

1:27:02.467 --> 1:27:03.551
Yes.

1:27:04.928 --> 1:27:06.304
A little more to the left.

1:27:07.222 --> 1:27:08.347
Here.

1:27:16.648 --> 1:27:18.524
I figure that's dead-on.

1:27:18.609 --> 1:27:19.942
Thank you.

1:27:37.919 --> 1:27:40.504
- All right. Let's do it.
- Come on, man, let's smoke him!

1:27:42.257 --> 1:27:45.801
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that metallic mother?

1:27:45.886 --> 1:27:47.470
Zip it up, Emil!

1:27:47.888 --> 1:27:50.056
Nothing fancy. Just kill him.

1:27:50.182 --> 1:27:52.350
Emil, in the van.

1:27:55.437 --> 1:27:57.146
You should get out of here now.

1:27:57.230 --> 1:27:58.898
Hey, we're partners.

1:27:59.941 --> 1:28:01.317
Get the car.

1:28:37.396 --> 1:28:39.146
Damn it! Shit!

1:28:39.231 --> 1:28:40.773
Looking for me?

1:28:53.578 --> 1:28:55.538
Cut him off! Come on!

1:28:55.622 --> 1:28:57.164
Go on, cut him off!

1:28:57.249 --> 1:28:58.666
Go, go!

1:29:30.365 --> 1:29:32.992
Okay! Now I got you!

1:30:19.915 --> 1:30:20.915
Shit!

1:30:35.597 --> 1:30:36.806
Help me.

1:30:36.890 --> 1:30:38.808
Don't touch me, man!

1:30:40.519 --> 1:30:41.936
Help me.

1:30:44.940 --> 1:30:45.981
God!

1:31:00.997 --> 1:31:02.122
Shit!

1:31:29.985 --> 1:31:31.360
Bye-bye, baby.

1:31:31.444 --> 1:31:32.945
Clarence!

1:31:58.930 --> 1:31:59.972
Okay.

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.016
I give up.

1:32:02.267 --> 1:32:04.143
I'm not arresting you anymore.

1:32:04.352 --> 1:32:06.729
Now, wait a second.

1:32:13.570 --> 1:32:15.112
Wait a minute.

1:32:15.196 --> 1:32:17.364
You're taking this kind of personal,
aren't you?

1:32:17.449 --> 1:32:20.910
Come on, man. Come on, now.
You're making me nervous.

1:32:20.994 --> 1:32:22.620
Come on, you can't do this.

1:32:22.704 --> 1:32:24.705
Come on now! Don't mess around!

1:32:25.206 --> 1:32:26.874
Hey! Hey!

1:32:27.042 --> 1:32:28.834
Come on, man, now, don't get cute!

1:32:33.298 --> 1:32:35.215
Die, you bastard!

1:32:35.300 --> 1:32:36.300
Yeah!

1:32:36.384 --> 1:32:38.177
Yeah! All right!

1:32:38.553 --> 1:32:40.012
All right!

1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:42.514
I got him, Clarence! I got him!

1:33:09.960 --> 1:33:12.670
Sayonara, Robocop!

1:33:26.768 --> 1:33:30.938
Lewis!

1:33:34.275 --> 1:33:36.568
Murphy, I'm a mess!

1:33:39.698 --> 1:33:41.281
They'll fix you.

1:33:42.242 --> 1:33:43.993
They fix everything.

1:33:54.129 --> 1:33:56.005
The police strike could really work for us.

1:33:56.089 --> 1:33:59.383
By the end of the week, we can have
Ed 209s in place all over the city

1:33:59.467 --> 1:34:01.552
and expect immediate public support.

1:34:01.636 --> 1:34:04.847
I've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

1:34:11.813 --> 1:34:14.773
You are illegally parked
on private property.

1:34:14.983 --> 1:34:17.860
You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.

1:34:53.688 --> 1:34:55.105
...because whatever happens,

1:34:55.190 --> 1:34:58.442
this corporation will live up
to the guiding principles of its founder.

1:34:58.526 --> 1:35:01.987
Courage, strength, conviction.

1:35:04.991 --> 1:35:09.870
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

1:35:12.207 --> 1:35:13.499
What is it?

1:35:14.959 --> 1:35:16.418
I don't know.

1:35:19.339 --> 1:35:21.298
How can we help you, Officer?

1:35:21.549 --> 1:35:23.884
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

1:35:24.052 --> 1:35:28.764
This is absurd! That thing
is a violent mechanical psychopath.

1:35:28.848 --> 1:35:33.185
My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.

1:35:33.686 --> 1:35:36.396
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

1:35:46.950 --> 1:35:50.244
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

1:35:51.246 --> 1:35:53.872
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

1:35:55.250 --> 1:35:58.502
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

1:35:59.337 --> 1:36:01.922
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

1:36:02.090 --> 1:36:03.549
He's got a gun!

1:36:04.634 --> 1:36:05.926
Get up!

1:36:06.010 --> 1:36:07.803
I want a chopper. Now!

1:36:08.596 --> 1:36:11.223
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

1:36:11.599 --> 1:36:14.393
I will board the chopper with my hostage.

1:36:16.437 --> 1:36:18.438
Anybody tries to stop me,

1:36:19.732 --> 1:36:21.608
the old geezer gets it.

1:36:24.612 --> 1:36:26.613
Dick, you're fired!

1:36:28.491 --> 1:36:29.491
Thank you.

1:36:54.934 --> 1:36:57.519
Nice shooting, son. What's your name?

1:37:00.315 --> 1:37:01.481
Murphy.
