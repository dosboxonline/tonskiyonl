<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

00:27.135 --> 00:29.174
<i>We're in Moscow in the Soviet Union.</i>

00:29.304 --> 00:35.223
<i>This promises to be the most watched</i>
<i>event in boxing history.</i>

00:42.567 --> 00:44.606
I must break you.

00:49.198 --> 00:52.034
- Throw your right!
<i>- He won't let him out of that corner.</i>

00:52.160 --> 00:54.199
Rocky!

00:55.914 --> 00:58.321
<i>Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble.</i>

00:58.458 --> 01:00.497
He's gettin' killed out there.

01:02.921 --> 01:06.124
<i>Drago continuing</i>
<i>to punish Rocky Balboa.</i>

01:08.676 --> 01:11.048
- No pain.
- No pain.

01:13.222 --> 01:15.345
<i>Rocky's been hit with bombs.</i>

01:15.475 --> 01:16.720
<i>Rocky's hurt.</i>

01:18.478 --> 01:23.187
<i>A right hand from Drago sends</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa 15 feet across the ring.</i>

01:25.443 --> 01:27.601
Come on. Get up!

01:30.531 --> 01:33.449
<i>It's been a one-sided fight so far.</i>

01:33.576 --> 01:37.574
<i>And Drago throws a hard right hand</i>
<i>that stuns Rocky Balboa.</i>

01:39.749 --> 01:43.877
<i>They might have to stop this one</i>
<i>before somebody gets killed.</i>

01:48.424 --> 01:52.339
<i>Rocky taking punishment.</i>
<i>He is completely exhausted.</i>

02:04.023 --> 02:08.103
<i>And Balboa goes down again</i>
<i>from a right hand.</i>

02:14.909 --> 02:17.614
<i>Punch after punch. Amazing willpower!</i>

02:22.250 --> 02:26.164
<i>Rocky Balboa has taken</i>
<i>Ivan Drago's best punches so far.</i>

02:26.296 --> 02:28.253
<i>He's cut and he's bleeding.</i>

02:28.381 --> 02:31.880
- All right, what's happenin' out there?
- I see three of 'em.

02:32.010 --> 02:35.758
- Hit the one in the middle.
- Right! Hit the one in the middle.

02:37.056 --> 02:39.547
<i>- The Russian's cut.</i>
- Hit him!

02:54.616 --> 02:59.491
<i>To the ground like a wrestler. It's a
<i>gutter war. No holds barred in Moscow.</i></i>

02:59.621 --> 03:02.990
All your strength.
All your power! Everything you've got!

03:03.124 --> 03:05.366
Now, this is your whole life here!

03:05.501 --> 03:08.206
<i>And a big right hand by Rocky Balboa.</i>

03:12.967 --> 03:16.467
<i>Rocky Balboa has done the impossible.</i>

03:39.786 --> 03:45.326
Oh, man, I never saw nothing like it.
Came through like the champ you are.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.783
Did yourself and everybody proud.

03:47.919 --> 03:50.161
Especially Apollo!

03:50.296 --> 03:53.748
- Yo, Tony.
- Yeah, what is it? What do you need?

03:53.883 --> 03:55.923
Get Adrian.

04:09.732 --> 04:12.354
How's everybody doin' out there?

04:12.485 --> 04:15.106
Everything's OK.

04:16.572 --> 04:18.612
What's wrong?

04:20.535 --> 04:25.529
- What's wrong?
- Remember when Mick said

04:25.665 --> 04:28.417
when he was fighting sometimes,

04:28.543 --> 04:34.664
he'd fight so hard that he was thinking
that he broke something inside?

04:34.799 --> 04:37.586
He was gonna die?

04:37.719 --> 04:43.804
And that's what he said, that's when
the angels was pulling on him.

04:43.933 --> 04:47.349
Rocky, you're scaring me.
I don't know what's wrong.

04:47.478 --> 04:50.148
- I can't...
- Can't what?

04:53.401 --> 04:56.022
I can't stop my hands from shaking.

04:59.407 --> 05:02.527
- I ain't never felt this thing.
- You better see a doctor.

05:02.660 --> 05:05.495
No. I just wanna go home.

05:05.622 --> 05:07.661
No. You can see a doctor.

05:07.790 --> 05:10.281
I'm just tired.

05:10.418 --> 05:12.956
I just wanna go home, Mick.

05:13.796 --> 05:16.584
- I'm just tired. I just...
- OK.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.254
- I just wanna go home, OK?
- OK.

05:41.532 --> 05:44.368
- Adrian, where's the kid?
- I don't know.

05:45.453 --> 05:49.320
I don't see the kid.
Where's the kid? Ain't he here?

05:49.999 --> 05:52.455
- Dad!
- There he is!

05:52.585 --> 05:55.586
Hey, slugger! How you doin'?

05:55.713 --> 05:57.587
- Say hi to your mom.
- Hi, Mom.

05:57.715 --> 05:59.922
- I'm forgotten now?
- Hi, Uncle Paulie.

06:00.051 --> 06:02.968
- Dad, how do you feel?
- A few new dents. How's school?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.756
I made the honour roll.

06:04.889 --> 06:09.302
Hi. Airport Security. Welcome home.
There's a press reception inside.

06:10.812 --> 06:13.682
Rocky, how did you feel
about the Russian people?

06:13.815 --> 06:16.388
You know, very good.
They was great people.

06:16.526 --> 06:21.069
I didn't understand what they said
all the time, but I knew what they meant.

06:21.197 --> 06:23.439
Mrs Balboa, did you learn any Russian?

06:23.575 --> 06:27.489
- Did I learn Russian?
- Yeah, she got fluent in vodka.

06:28.705 --> 06:31.789
Rocky, there are rumours
of physical complications.

06:31.916 --> 06:35.166
- Complications?
- No, those were rumours.

06:35.295 --> 06:38.295
He's in perfect physical condition.

06:39.841 --> 06:45.179
Rocky, the American Medical Association
has recommended that boxing be banned.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.593
- Yeah.
- Do you agree with the doctors?

06:47.724 --> 06:51.673
Yeah, absolutely.
I think that doctors should never fight.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.432
That was a beautiful answer, champ.

06:54.564 --> 06:59.356
Doctors should stay out of the ring.
Doctors should never fight.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.321
Rocky Balboa,
the funniest champion ever.

07:02.447 --> 07:05.116
America's own Rocky Balboa!
How are ya?

07:05.241 --> 07:08.195
George Washington Duke,
promoter <i>extraordinaire,</i>

07:08.494 --> 07:13.489
welcomes Rocky Balboa, champion
of all the Americas and all of the Russias.

07:13.625 --> 07:16.412
I would like to digress
from the questions a bit

07:16.544 --> 07:18.833
and pose a proposition to the media.

07:19.380 --> 07:23.460
Everyone in this city and in the
world of sports knows my reputation

07:23.593 --> 07:28.054
for promoting some of the finest
extravaganzas in this country.

07:28.181 --> 07:33.519
Well now, with the press present,
I'd like to ask you, Rocky Balboa,

07:33.645 --> 07:38.223
to be the flamboyant, rambunctious
sportsman we know you can be.

07:38.358 --> 07:41.774
Give this man, Union Cane,
a chance to challenge you

07:41.903 --> 07:44.109
for the heavyweight championship.

07:44.239 --> 07:47.939
Balboa, I want the opportunity
to take what you got.

07:48.076 --> 07:52.120
Isn't it bad timing to challenge, Duke?
The man just got off the plane.

07:52.247 --> 07:55.247
Timing is the essence of life,
gentlemen and ladies.

07:55.375 --> 07:59.040
Now what I have on this paper
is the largest guarantee

07:59.170 --> 08:02.171
ever offered to a champion on this planet.

08:02.298 --> 08:07.459
I'm talking about a fantastic international
extravaganza, to be held in Japan,

08:07.595 --> 08:10.632
called Lettin' It Go In Tokyo.

08:11.349 --> 08:16.474
It's incredible. Only in America do people
like us rise from oppression and poverty

08:16.604 --> 08:19.689
to join hands in this international event.

08:19.816 --> 08:23.101
- Excuse me.
- Only in America!

08:23.236 --> 08:26.153
Excuse me. My husband is retired.

08:26.281 --> 08:28.819
He has nothing more to prove.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.026
Wait a minute! Hey, Rocky...

08:31.160 --> 08:35.988
Don't you consider this a public
responsibility to respond now?

08:36.124 --> 08:39.493
- Respond to the people.
- Isn't this about professionalism?

08:39.626 --> 08:43.376
- To talk about it now, not later.
- Do you mind if I heal first?

08:43.506 --> 08:47.586
- You got nothin' like what I got for you.
- What the hell does this all mean?

08:47.719 --> 08:51.930
- That isn't enough. We gotta know now.
- Gotta think about that. So anyway,

08:52.056 --> 08:56.434
I wanna tell everybody that
the flight over was really nice.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.853
- Come on, guys. We need more.
- Adrian, if you weren't with me,

09:00.982 --> 09:04.398
I never woulda done as good.
You're always there.

09:04.527 --> 09:09.569
And my kid, having you is
like being born all over again.

09:09.699 --> 09:12.071
Come on. Are you gonna retire or not?

09:12.201 --> 09:16.780
- Anyway, excuse me. I'd like to go home.
- Give us something to write.

09:16.915 --> 09:20.959
- Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
- No!

09:24.005 --> 09:27.041
Don't worry. We'll get him.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.979
No, really. It's great.

09:53.910 --> 09:59.699
Look at this place! I swear I ain't never
leavin' this place again, you know that?

09:59.832 --> 10:04.459
Hey, would you like to dance? How about
a homecoming dance for your old man?

10:04.587 --> 10:08.003
- No, don't be silly. It's cold.
- I'll warm you up, young lady.

10:08.132 --> 10:11.383
Have a dance. Hurry up.
The music's almost over.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.301
- Do you like the song?
- You should rest.

10:15.431 --> 10:17.554
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm tired. Come on.

10:17.684 --> 10:21.432
Maybe I'll take you upstairs and
violate you like a parkin' meter.

10:21.562 --> 10:24.267
- Cost you a quarter.
- Yo, Adrian!

10:24.399 --> 10:27.269
Where'd you learn to talk dirty like that?

10:29.237 --> 10:33.484
Uncle Paulie,
you notice something strange about Dad?

10:33.616 --> 10:35.905
He just took a few hard shots.

10:36.035 --> 10:39.369
I think you tell
better jokes than me, Adrian.

10:43.918 --> 10:47.453
Did I hear somebody
call for their old man? Did you do this?

10:47.589 --> 10:49.332
Sleep time, kid, OK?

10:49.465 --> 10:53.048
Dad, did you know your bones
grow three times as fast at night?

10:53.177 --> 10:56.677
No, I didn't, but I heard
somethin' like that. Is that me?

10:56.806 --> 10:58.929
- Oh yeah, that's you.
- Excellent!

10:59.058 --> 11:02.178
- Is that me? When we was fishin', right?
- Yeah.

11:02.312 --> 11:04.637
That's beautiful! Look at the tent.

11:04.772 --> 11:08.058
You know,
the fish was a lot bigger, if I recall.

11:09.027 --> 11:11.434
Actually, that was a lot smaller.

11:11.946 --> 11:16.074
Anyway, come on. Hit the bed.
It's time for you to get healthy.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.320
This is great.
I don't know where you learned this.

11:19.454 --> 11:23.202
It is something how this thing
comes out of your fingers and...

11:23.333 --> 11:25.372
Oh my God.

11:30.131 --> 11:32.171
Who's this?

11:33.092 --> 11:36.296
It's Madame Dupont, my French teacher.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.969
Really?

11:41.309 --> 11:43.302
Yeah. She looks French, sure.

11:43.436 --> 11:48.596
I wouldn't show this to your mother, cos
she don't understand French too good.

11:48.733 --> 11:51.568
God. Better cover that one up.

11:51.694 --> 11:54.185
Well, champ, it's bedtime.

11:54.322 --> 11:57.193
Hey, you know what?
I know some French talk.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.448
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

11:59.577 --> 12:01.949
- Madame.
- Madame who?

12:02.080 --> 12:05.081
- Ma damn foot's caught in the door!
- That's an old joke.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.829
What do you want from me? I'm trying.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.961
I don't know all the good things,
you know?

12:11.089 --> 12:13.710
- What's this?
- What?

12:14.467 --> 12:18.963
Look what I found in your ear.
Russian money. Money ears!

12:19.430 --> 12:22.467
All right. Anyway, listen.
You gotta get some sleep.

12:22.600 --> 12:27.179
Dad? Today, when you said
having me was like being born again...

12:27.313 --> 12:29.851
- Yeah?
- What did you mean?

12:29.983 --> 12:32.937
Well, you know, you come up like I did

12:33.069 --> 12:39.273
and you got, like, three square meals
of zero a day, know what I mean?

12:39.409 --> 12:41.697
You got the A-side of life and the B-side.

12:41.828 --> 12:45.528
I'm on the B-side, but you...
you got all the breaks.

12:45.665 --> 12:49.994
So when I see you having
all these things that I didn't have,

12:50.128 --> 12:53.129
I, like, live through your eyes.

12:53.256 --> 12:57.834
I enjoy it a little bit.
It's like having it all over again.

12:57.969 --> 13:00.045
That's nice.

13:00.179 --> 13:04.343
Hey, look in my face.
Do I look like a raccoon?

13:05.101 --> 13:07.307
- A little bit.
- Like Rocky Raccoon?

13:07.437 --> 13:09.097
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Nah!

13:09.230 --> 13:11.139
- Yeah, you do a little.
- Really?

13:11.274 --> 13:16.019
Hey, if you think I look bad,
you oughta see the other guy's knuckles.

13:17.113 --> 13:19.734
Anyway, yo. Good night.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.905
- OK, kid?
- Night.

13:23.453 --> 13:25.244
- Dad?
- Yo?

13:26.372 --> 13:30.037
- Glad you're home.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

13:30.710 --> 13:34.790
We'll play tomorrow, OK? Maybe
you can show me your English teacher.

13:34.923 --> 13:37.460
- She's pretty hot, too.
- Nah!

13:38.009 --> 13:39.717
Good night, kid.

13:39.844 --> 13:42.169
You deserve the worst for what you did.

13:42.305 --> 13:45.306
- That was Rocky's money.
- You wanna be hysterical?

13:45.433 --> 13:48.304
- You cost us everything.
- It was a mistake.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.057
You think I thought
this was gonna happen?

13:51.189 --> 13:55.981
Don't you walk away from me.
You just gave up our life!

13:56.110 --> 13:58.399
And you think it's some stupid thing?

13:58.529 --> 14:02.574
Paulie, do you know what you did?
Do you know how serious it is?

14:02.700 --> 14:07.279
I understand it!
I understand the whole freakin' thing!

14:07.413 --> 14:10.782
I understand it.
Your accountant's a crook, not me!

14:10.917 --> 14:13.787
I did what I thought was right.
Don't blame me.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.375
I want to murder the bum
worse than anybody.

14:16.506 --> 14:18.545
Adrian, what's wrong?

14:18.675 --> 14:21.344
Look what you done now.
She's dumpin' it all on me.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.470
- Come on, don't turn this around on me.
- What did you do?

14:24.597 --> 14:28.097
He gave power of attorney
to our accountant.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.977
I just didn't gave anything to nobody.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.604
He sent a letter. He says
"We'll be in Russia a couple of months

14:35.733 --> 14:38.224
and I need Rocky to sign a tax extension."

14:38.361 --> 14:42.062
That extension was
a power of attorney, Paulie!

14:42.198 --> 14:45.199
He's the thief! I need alcohol.

14:45.326 --> 14:49.075
Rocky, on my eyes,
I never stole a freakin' dime.

14:49.205 --> 14:51.827
Adrian, what's happenin' here?

14:51.958 --> 14:53.997
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

14:54.127 --> 14:58.290
The money. The money.
Everything. It's all gone.

14:58.506 --> 15:02.883
The piece of paper Paulie had you sign
wasn't a request for a tax extension.

15:03.011 --> 15:07.055
It was a blanket power of attorney
in favour of the accountant,

15:07.181 --> 15:10.052
who was involved in
some high-priced real estate.

15:10.184 --> 15:14.348
He thought he could have your money
back before you knew it was gone.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.316
Unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room,

15:17.442 --> 15:21.736
his deals fell through because the
market dried up. And you lost millions.

15:21.863 --> 15:26.110
- Ain't there nothin' I can do?
- I've filed eight criminal acts against him.

15:26.242 --> 15:29.029
But you've got debt payment
on this property,

15:29.162 --> 15:33.539
he didn't pay your tax returns and your
mortgage hasn't been paid in months.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.082
We didn't have a mortgage.
Our house was fully paid for.

15:37.211 --> 15:42.372
- Don't take it from me. Ask him.
- There's nearly $400,000 outstanding.

15:42.508 --> 15:46.292
The only thing that is not encumbered
is a gym, willed to your son

15:46.429 --> 15:49.465
by a Mickey Goldmill in 1982.

15:49.599 --> 15:52.766
You can sell things.
Remember those commercials you did?

15:52.894 --> 15:56.477
I ain't no commercial kinda guy.
I'm a fighter. That's what I do.

15:56.606 --> 16:00.935
No, we couldn't get sponsors.
With the investigation of the accountant,

16:01.069 --> 16:04.769
out pops a criminal record
of Rocky's for assault.

16:04.906 --> 16:07.397
But that was a long time ago.
He didn't know...

16:07.533 --> 16:11.780
Why not a couple more fights? With
your popularity, you'd be out in no time.

16:11.913 --> 16:14.534
- He's retiring.
- Rocko, fighting's the ticket.

16:14.666 --> 16:18.331
I said he's retired!
Paulie, we're here because of you.

16:18.461 --> 16:22.957
I'm not taking the heat for all this.
I thought I was doing smart business.

16:23.091 --> 16:28.595
- You thought you did smart business?
- Hey! The accountant was your choice.

16:28.721 --> 16:33.679
You shoulda known he was a thief, but in
your fairy-tale world the air don't move.

16:33.810 --> 16:36.597
- You're like a season that don't change.
- Hey, enough.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.766
I'm not no tomato can you kick around.

16:39.899 --> 16:44.146
You call Duke. Tell him I'll fight Cane.
I don't care. Anywhere, any time.

16:44.279 --> 16:47.730
- No. Rocky, no!
- If that's what you want, I'll get on it.

16:47.865 --> 16:51.281
- Rocky, please.
- A couple of fights, we're outta trouble.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.198
- Yeah, but you said...
- No, I didn't say anything.

16:54.330 --> 16:57.450
- Did we come this far to lose it?
- You have to see a doctor.

16:57.584 --> 17:02.744
- I don't need a doctor. I need a promoter.
- If the doctor says OK, I'll support you.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.380
I gotta fight, OK?
I got problems. I gotta fight.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.549
Will you do it for me?

17:10.555 --> 17:12.132
All right. For you.

17:13.057 --> 17:15.844
Because of continuous
violent blows to the head,

17:15.977 --> 17:20.603
you have a condition particular to boxers
called <i>cavum septum pellucidum,</i>

17:20.732 --> 17:24.017
which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles.

17:24.152 --> 17:27.983
The brain surface neurons in this area
have also been traumatised.

17:28.114 --> 17:33.737
Simply stated, Mr Balboa, it means that
you have suffered damage to the brain.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.909
How long until he recovers?

17:36.039 --> 17:38.280
The effects are irreversible.

17:40.251 --> 17:42.540
Rocky, you have to retire.

17:42.670 --> 17:48.091
I don't wanna retire. This ain't the time
to retire. Not in here, not in no office.

17:49.052 --> 17:54.093
I just fought the best fight of my life.
I just did that, you know?

17:54.223 --> 17:59.182
- And all I need is a couple more.
- No. You suffered severe brain trauma.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.981
He could be wrong.
Anybody could be wrong.

18:02.106 --> 18:04.597
He ain't God.
Adrian, only God ain't wrong.

18:04.734 --> 18:08.566
- Rocky, this is what's good for you.
- I only need a couple of easy ones.

18:08.696 --> 18:13.524
Not the way it is. You can't get licensed
in any State. He can't, can he, Doctor?

18:13.660 --> 18:17.527
- That is correct.
- Rocky, do you love me?

18:20.041 --> 18:24.667
- Yeah, I love you. Why do you ask that?
- Because if you love somebody,

18:24.796 --> 18:28.924
you live with them, you live for them.
You don't gamble with a life.

18:29.050 --> 18:32.882
Rocky, I don't care
about the money. It's you.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.052
That's all that matters.

18:36.349 --> 18:40.643
Please. We'll be OK. We'll be fine.

18:51.197 --> 18:56.155
- No one has to know, Doctor, right?
- It'll be strictly confidential.

18:59.831 --> 19:01.870
Thank you.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.681
<i>May we hear our next bid, please?</i>

19:23.813 --> 19:26.055
<i>Are you done?</i>

19:26.190 --> 19:28.432
<i>Sold.</i>

19:30.653 --> 19:33.820
<i>Moving along, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>Item number 46...</i>

19:33.948 --> 19:36.866
Hey, kid. Bike's been sold.

19:36.993 --> 19:40.113
Hey, bike's been sold.
Get off the bike. Come on.

19:49.213 --> 19:51.621
Don't worry about it.
We been down before.

19:51.758 --> 19:56.585
I'll get it all back. We just gotta
stick together, hey? Home team.

19:56.721 --> 19:58.548
Yeah, right.

19:59.599 --> 20:04.060
Come on. You know, Mickey used to say
a fight ain't over till you heard the bell.

20:04.187 --> 20:06.226
We ain't heard a bell yet, have we?

20:06.356 --> 20:09.855
<i>Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves</i>
<i>from his first fight...</i>

20:27.669 --> 20:29.994
Rocky?

20:30.672 --> 20:32.913
Hey, it still fits.

20:35.051 --> 20:37.720
Why are you wearin' those clothes?

20:37.845 --> 20:43.006
I was just going through some stuff and I
found them. They feel kinda comfortable.

20:43.142 --> 20:47.270
I was looking all over for you downstairs.
It's kind of depressing.

20:47.397 --> 20:50.516
Yeah, I know what you mean.

20:51.234 --> 20:53.310
What's this doin' in your ear?

20:54.195 --> 20:57.646
- Oh, God!
- Remember these?

20:57.782 --> 20:59.525
Yeah.

21:00.868 --> 21:06.243
- I remember when you took 'em off.
- That's right. First time I ever kissed you.

21:08.960 --> 21:14.251
Adrian, I wanna go out for a bit.
You know, just take a little walk.

21:14.382 --> 21:17.917
I just wanna feel better.
But hey, could you talk to the kid?

21:18.052 --> 21:21.671
- Cos he's really taking this hard.
- Sure.

21:23.808 --> 21:27.722
- Where are you going?
- I thought I'd go to Andy's.

21:37.947 --> 21:41.862
- He used to be a champion.
- How did he blow it all?

22:11.731 --> 22:14.187
How you doing, Mick?

23:24.429 --> 23:26.468
Slip the jab.

23:32.312 --> 23:34.351
Slip the jab!

23:36.399 --> 23:38.439
That's right. That's it.

23:38.568 --> 23:40.607
- Hey, I didn't hear no bell!
- OK.

23:42.530 --> 23:45.650
All right! That's right. Slip the jab.

23:45.783 --> 23:49.651
That's it. Mentalise!
See that bum in front of you.

23:49.787 --> 23:53.832
You see yourself doing right,
and you do right.

23:53.958 --> 23:56.532
That's pretty. That's very pretty.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.626
Time!

23:58.755 --> 24:01.791
Come here, Rock.
My God, you're ready, ain't ya?

24:01.925 --> 24:06.136
Apollo won't know what hit him.
You'll roll over him like a bulldozer.

24:06.262 --> 24:08.302
An Italian bulldozer.

24:08.431 --> 24:12.476
You know, kid, I know how you feel
about this fight that's comin' up.

24:12.602 --> 24:14.974
Because I was young once, too.

24:16.189 --> 24:18.727
I tell you somethin'.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.314
Why, if you wasn't here,

24:21.444 --> 24:24.778
I probably wouldn't be alive today.

24:24.906 --> 24:29.651
The fact that you're here and doing
as well as you're doing gives me...

24:29.786 --> 24:34.198
What do you call it?
A motivisation to stay alive.

24:34.332 --> 24:38.828
<i>Cos I think that people die sometimes</i>
<i>when they don't wanna live no more.</i>

24:38.962 --> 24:41.085
Nature's smarter than people think.

24:41.214 --> 24:45.675
And nature is smarter than people think.
Little by little we lose our friends,

24:45.802 --> 24:50.713
we lose everything and we keep
losing and losing, till we say:

24:50.848 --> 24:55.427
"What the hell am I living around
here for? I got no reason to go on."

24:56.521 --> 24:58.976
But with you, kid...

24:59.107 --> 25:01.432
Boy, I got a reason to go on.

25:01.901 --> 25:06.195
<i>And I'm gonna stay alive.</i>
<i>And I will watch you make good.</i>

25:06.322 --> 25:10.783
- And I'll never leave you.
- I'll never leave you until that happens.

25:10.910 --> 25:15.702
Cos when I leave you,
you'll not only know how to fight,

25:15.832 --> 25:20.043
you'll be able to take care of yourself
outside the ring, too. Is that OK?

25:20.169 --> 25:22.874
<i>- It's OK.</i>
<i>- OK.</i>

25:23.965 --> 25:26.041
- I got a gift for you.
- Ah, Mickey.

25:26.175 --> 25:29.426
- Wait a minute now.
- Really, I don't need nothin'.

25:29.554 --> 25:36.221
Look at that. See that? This here's the
favourite thing that I have on this earth.

25:36.352 --> 25:39.602
And Rocky Marciano give me that.

25:39.731 --> 25:42.566
You know what it was? His cuff link.

25:43.651 --> 25:46.771
And now I'm giving it to you.

25:46.905 --> 25:49.941
<i>And it's gonna be like...</i>

25:50.074 --> 25:53.739
Like an angel on your shoulder to you.

25:53.870 --> 25:59.291
And if you ever get hurt and
you feel that you're goin' down,

25:59.417 --> 26:02.501
this little angel
is gonna whisper in your ear.

26:02.629 --> 26:06.128
He's gonna say
"Get up, you son of a bitch!"

26:07.800 --> 26:10.173
"Cos Mickey loves you."

26:10.303 --> 26:12.758
<i>OK?</i>

26:12.889 --> 26:15.806
Thanks, Mick. I love you, too.

26:15.934 --> 26:18.471
Jesus. Go after him, kid.

26:19.854 --> 26:22.060
- Go after him.
- Thanks.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.940
You was the angel.

26:29.072 --> 26:32.156
- There it is.
- What happened to his other cuff link?

26:32.283 --> 26:35.035
I don't know. He only give me one.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.403
He gave it to some bum.

27:26.170 --> 27:29.088
Careful. Don't worry about these.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.504
All right, let's go, Paulie.

27:31.634 --> 27:35.502
I really can't believe it.
This kid's taking this too good.

27:35.638 --> 27:40.016
Hey, Rock, it's good I kept
the place, right? It saves money.

27:40.143 --> 27:41.554
Get back.

27:41.686 --> 27:46.099
Right? A little aluminum
on the front too. It's a winner!

27:50.069 --> 27:52.109
Thank you.

27:52.906 --> 27:55.990
Welcome back, Rocky. We missed ya!

27:57.368 --> 28:00.286
It's only temporary, you know?

28:00.413 --> 28:02.453
Come on inside.

28:13.009 --> 28:14.752
- Hello?
<i>- Mrs Balboa?</i>

28:14.886 --> 28:17.922
<i>- George Washington Duke here.</i>
- Yes?

28:18.056 --> 28:22.931
Mrs Balboa, can you hear it?
Listen close. You must be able to hear it.

28:23.061 --> 28:25.634
- Hear what?
<i>- The sound of the parade going by,</i>

28:25.772 --> 28:27.811
<i>of opportunity knocking.</i>

28:27.941 --> 28:30.017
What'll take to get you to realise

28:30.151 --> 28:33.520
I'm givin' you a chance
to pull yourselves together?

28:33.655 --> 28:39.241
Let me handle your husband's career
and you can live like human beings again.

28:39.369 --> 28:44.659
Listen, Mr Duke, we're living like human
beings. You oughta try it some time.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.163
And leave my husband alone.

28:50.421 --> 28:52.461
Women!

28:58.721 --> 29:01.010
When'd you start that?

29:01.140 --> 29:04.924
I don't know. It's like a bad habit
that comes back. But, hey!

29:05.061 --> 29:08.145
We ain't talkin' about me.
We're talkin' about you.

29:08.273 --> 29:10.312
Hey, Rocky, how you doin', man?

29:10.441 --> 29:13.015
- Good to see you back.
- Thanks. Great to <i>be</i> back.

29:13.152 --> 29:16.936
You're smart in school,
but you gotta be smart on the street, too.

29:17.073 --> 29:19.944
- How do you mean?
- You gotta know who the players are

29:20.076 --> 29:24.489
- and who you're talkin' to.
- Watch out for scams. Everyone scams.

29:24.622 --> 29:26.947
- What's a scam?
- Ask your father.

29:27.458 --> 29:30.210
- A scam is like a hustle.
- He don't get it.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.123
- Well, a hustle's related to...
- Rocky!

29:33.256 --> 29:35.711
- Remember me? I'm Bubba's mother.
- Oh, yeah.

29:35.842 --> 29:39.970
- You used his head for a punchin' bag.
- Yeah, he had a nice head.

29:41.139 --> 29:44.721
- Anyway, a hustle's related to a con.
- He don't get it.

29:44.851 --> 29:48.136
A deception?
You're saying beware of deceptions.

29:48.271 --> 29:52.316
Yeah, that's good. Absolutely.
You're very smart, you know?

29:53.860 --> 29:56.529
Ain't this where
the Atomic Hoagy shop used to be?

29:56.654 --> 29:58.611
I'm new here, Dad.

29:58.740 --> 30:02.987
- This neighbourhood's got tooth decay.
- It's called urban blight.

30:04.162 --> 30:07.613
I'll tell you somethin',
this place is blightin' everywhere.

30:07.749 --> 30:12.161
A little aluminum siding and paint, this
place could be OK. What do you think?

30:12.295 --> 30:17.882
Anyway, we're late for school.
Paulie, I wanna talk to the kid private like.

30:18.009 --> 30:20.048
- Like I got no feelings.
- Oh, come on.

30:20.178 --> 30:23.048
- That's how wars start.
- Relax, would you?

30:23.181 --> 30:27.261
- So anyway, everybody's got an angle.
- Tough break, Rock.

30:27.393 --> 30:32.814
Everybody's got a hustle. These kids have
got street brains. That's how they live.

30:32.941 --> 30:37.602
These kids ain't like no personalities
that you've grown up with.

30:37.737 --> 30:41.402
- So you gotta stay very sharp round here.
- I intend to.

30:41.532 --> 30:46.278
Intend! You know, sometimes
you make me feel very stupid.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.947
- Why?
- Why? Cos you're smarter than me.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.577
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

30:51.709 --> 30:55.707
It's like every day you learn somethin'
new and I forget somethin' new.

30:55.838 --> 30:58.674
But hey, listen.
We're in this thing together.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.584
If you can figure out how to fix
things up, don't be afraid to tell me.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.721
We gotta stick together, cos what are we?

31:05.848 --> 31:08.304
- What?
- What are we?

31:09.644 --> 31:12.645
- Oh, home team.
- Home team! You've got that right.

31:12.772 --> 31:18.692
I used to go to this school when I was
a kid. Nice bricks. It was real tough then.

31:18.820 --> 31:22.153
But I think you can handle it,
don't you think?

31:24.659 --> 31:27.576
If you went here, I can go here.

31:27.704 --> 31:30.159
I'm not scared really.

31:30.290 --> 31:32.199
Really?

31:32.333 --> 31:34.741
Well, I guess I'm a little scared.

31:34.877 --> 31:38.412
- But that's normal, don't you think?
- Oh, yeah. I had 72 fights...

31:38.548 --> 31:43.922
...and every one of 'em I was scared, so
yeah, you know, that's real, real normal.

31:46.723 --> 31:50.305
- I'll see you later.
- OK, kid. Here's the front door.

31:52.437 --> 31:54.513
Hey, wait. What's this?

31:55.982 --> 31:58.520
Goodness gracious.
Where'd this come from?

31:58.651 --> 32:01.985
It's a strange place to stash
your lunch money.

32:02.113 --> 32:04.070
It's just a lunch joke, you know?

32:04.198 --> 32:07.947
- Thanks, Dad.
- OK, then, I'll see you later.

32:08.077 --> 32:11.612
Remember, Daddy loves you.
You're number one. Home team.

32:11.748 --> 32:14.203
Just be nice, right? You'll be OK.

32:15.126 --> 32:20.286
And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.
They don't like that around here.

32:26.429 --> 32:28.671
You know, I'm really
worried about the kid.

32:28.806 --> 32:32.258
He ain't used to livin' like this.
He don't know the streets.

32:32.393 --> 32:34.765
At school, I know what's gonna happen.

32:34.896 --> 32:39.937
Some wise guy's gonna come up to him
cos he's my kid and try to bang him out.

32:40.068 --> 32:43.022
Give him a cheap shot, you know?
I mean, jeez...

32:43.154 --> 32:46.903
- Mr Balboa, my name's Tommy Gunn.
- Yeah? How you doin'?

32:47.033 --> 32:49.239
With that name, you better be tough.

32:49.369 --> 32:54.031
It ain't easy. Anyway, I'm from Oklahoma.
My amateur record is 45 to one.

32:54.165 --> 32:57.997
- I turned pro at 18 and I had eight fights.
- You're a fighter?

32:58.127 --> 33:01.294
And now that I'm 20,
I'd just like to show you what I got.

33:01.422 --> 33:05.254
- I've saved up about 400 bucks...
- Mr Rocky Balboa!

33:05.385 --> 33:09.881
Excuse me, I have some business here.
Good to see you again, friend.

33:10.014 --> 33:13.348
- How you doin'?
- My health is fine. What more can I ask?

33:13.476 --> 33:17.141
- Listen, I gotta go to work now.
- What, here? In a sweatbox?

33:17.272 --> 33:20.641
- Can't be good for the image.
- Urban light. What can you do?

33:20.775 --> 33:23.480
What'd you say? It's blight. Urban blight.

33:23.611 --> 33:27.905
George wants you to consider wearing
gloves again. It's a helluva payday.

33:28.032 --> 33:30.819
- I'm officially expired.
- You have marquee value.

33:30.952 --> 33:36.706
You put asses into seats. A businessman
don't retire if he can still pull in the bread.

33:36.833 --> 33:41.246
- Only America gives these opportunities.
- Union Cane's going for the title.

33:41.379 --> 33:44.582
Here's some tickets.
We've a strong feeling about this.

33:44.716 --> 33:48.844
- If he takes it, that's the time to challenge.
- People love comebacks.

33:48.970 --> 33:52.505
There's nothing more commercial
than a long-shot comeback

33:52.640 --> 33:55.012
of a down-on-his-luck underdog.

33:55.143 --> 33:59.306
As Mark Twain said: "Virtue has
never been as respectable as money."

33:59.439 --> 34:01.099
- Who's Twain?
- A painter.

34:01.232 --> 34:03.355
You're the Great White Hope.

34:03.484 --> 34:06.320
You mean Great White Dope. No, forget it.

34:06.446 --> 34:10.775
Hold the bullshit. I know the problem.
You think I was born yesterday?

34:10.909 --> 34:16.116
Merlin, show him the paper. This is your
medical report. We can work around it.

34:16.246 --> 34:18.572
- Where'd you get this?
- It doesn't matter.

34:18.708 --> 34:22.077
If you fight Cane, George can
guarantee to get you a license.

34:22.210 --> 34:23.871
- Guaranteed.
- You can do this?

34:24.005 --> 34:26.710
- No problem.
- This comeback's in the bag.

34:26.841 --> 34:31.170
- The time's hot. The deal's hot. <i>Caliente!</i>
- We could use one more payday.

34:31.304 --> 34:35.929
- Adrian, where'd you come from?
- Mrs Balboa just appeared! She's magic.

34:36.059 --> 34:39.641
I don't think you're funny.
Are you talking him into fighting?

34:39.771 --> 34:43.222
Talking business, darlin'.
Do you like feelin' hard up?

34:43.358 --> 34:47.900
Do you like reachin' in your pocket
and only feelin' your leg? I didn't think so.

34:48.029 --> 34:51.445
I'm offering you the opportunity
to dump this loser image.

34:51.574 --> 34:54.824
- Who are you talking to?
- You ain't workin' across...

34:54.953 --> 34:59.081
What the hell are you talkin' about?
This is a tremendous opportunity.

34:59.207 --> 35:03.121
Opportunity for who? For you to
make money? For him to be disabled?

35:03.253 --> 35:06.040
What would you do
if the choices were reversed?

35:06.172 --> 35:08.248
You have to think about that.

35:08.383 --> 35:11.218
Rocky, they don't care about you.

35:11.844 --> 35:15.842
Let's get serious. You represent
the dreams of the long shots.

35:15.974 --> 35:20.470
The little people identify with you.
That is the key to public success.

35:20.603 --> 35:25.265
You a true champion, a true product of
the people. Sell it while they'll still buy.

35:25.400 --> 35:29.314
That ain't gonna last forever.
You say you a fighter, then fight!

35:29.445 --> 35:33.858
And I'll make you so much money you
can swim in it. You can swim, can't you?

35:33.992 --> 35:37.325
Whaddaya say?
Put some hustle behind this muscle.

35:37.453 --> 35:40.158
He's done. He's done fighting!

35:47.380 --> 35:49.622
You are a damn fool.

35:51.301 --> 35:54.255
Maybe we oughta sign
Mrs Balboa to fight Cane, huh?

35:54.387 --> 35:58.432
Looks like she's the one
with the <i>cojones</i> in the family.

35:59.892 --> 36:02.597
You don't talk like that in front of my wife.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.269
That ain't no park bench, boy.

36:09.152 --> 36:13.363
- I'll get him.
- Rocky, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanna...

36:13.489 --> 36:16.111
You guys want privacy? I'll be upstairs.

36:20.121 --> 36:22.493
Rocky.

36:22.624 --> 36:24.830
Rocky, I'm sorry. I...

36:24.959 --> 36:28.328
But it just takes one bad hit
and you could be an invalid.

36:28.463 --> 36:33.338
I feel like an invalid already. Why'd you
come back? You're too smart for this.

36:33.468 --> 36:36.884
I got nothing to do. I called Gloria.

36:37.013 --> 36:41.224
- She said she could use part-time help.
- But why do you wanna do this?

36:41.351 --> 36:45.395
Why go back to where you started?
I gotta do it, but you don't gotta do it!

36:45.521 --> 36:49.021
I wanted to be there
so I could be close to you.

36:58.451 --> 37:01.535
All right, yeah.
You know, it's gettin' cold out here.

37:01.663 --> 37:04.948
Maybe we better get inside, OK?
I understand.

37:05.083 --> 37:06.910
- Are you all right?
- What?

37:07.043 --> 37:09.795
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine.

37:09.921 --> 37:12.163
Adrian, it's gettin' cold, OK?

37:17.971 --> 37:21.719
Yo, Adrian! Did we ever leave this place?

37:24.519 --> 37:26.558
I don't know.

37:31.734 --> 37:34.439
Hey, mind if I talk to you now?

37:34.571 --> 37:37.240
My head's a little busy right now.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.415
You won't get him.
Balboa don't think straight.

37:51.546 --> 37:55.626
- None of these bums do. I need an angle.
- I'll fight Balboa right now.

37:55.967 --> 37:59.134
- I'm better than Balboa ever was.
- Hey!

38:00.221 --> 38:03.139
I own the paper on you.
You will fight who I tell you,

38:03.266 --> 38:06.682
where I tell you and how I tell you.
You got that?

38:07.770 --> 38:10.807
Don't aggravate
the hand that feeds you, huh?

38:14.193 --> 38:16.863
None of these bums think straight.

38:20.658 --> 38:22.402
All I need is a hook.

38:34.047 --> 38:36.716
Hey! Ain't you Rocky's kid?

38:36.841 --> 38:40.175
- Yeah! You Rocky's kid, right?
- Yeah. How're you doing?

38:40.303 --> 38:42.379
I've seen your picture in the paper.

38:42.513 --> 38:45.847
- You know what? Your old man's a punk.
- What?

38:47.268 --> 38:50.055
- Get off me!
- What are you wearing my coat for?

38:50.188 --> 38:52.761
- Just leave him alone!
- You wanna beatin' too?

38:52.899 --> 38:56.184
- Gimme my coat! I'm not kiddin' around.
- No way.

39:03.660 --> 39:05.783
Don't get sick now!

39:05.912 --> 39:09.281
Hope you don't catch cold, rich boy.

39:11.709 --> 39:15.161
Keep it high. Slip and slide. That's it.

39:15.296 --> 39:18.796
This is the cup Rocky drinks out of
around the house. Ten bucks.

39:18.925 --> 39:22.376
- How I know it's the real thing?
- Look at the lip marks.

39:22.512 --> 39:25.596
- All right. Five bucks. No more.
- You got a deal.

39:26.683 --> 39:28.841
- Excuse me.
- Tommy Gunn!

39:28.977 --> 39:31.847
- Is there some place I can change?
- In there.

39:31.980 --> 39:34.850
Time! Hey, Richard,
good friend, listen to me.

39:34.983 --> 39:37.556
If you wanna survive,
you gotta slip the jab.

39:37.694 --> 39:41.857
Keep it high and hit and not get hit,
you know? OK, take off.

39:41.990 --> 39:44.825
- Rocko, remember Tommy Gunn?
- Oh, yeah.

39:44.951 --> 39:47.489
He says he wants to fight.
I tell him to get married.

39:47.620 --> 39:49.280
Why?

39:49.414 --> 39:51.739
That's gym humour, Rocko.

39:53.293 --> 39:56.210
Let's see what you got there, kid.

39:56.337 --> 39:58.164
Get married. I understand.

39:58.298 --> 40:01.168
- Benson! Wanna move a little?
- Yeah, all right.

40:01.301 --> 40:05.512
Hey, Paulie, what's the <i>cojones?</i>

40:07.348 --> 40:10.515
<i>Cojones</i> is Latin for Spanish nuts.

40:10.643 --> 40:13.514
- Yo, Rock, we're ready.
- Wonderful.

40:15.023 --> 40:17.858
Hey, kid. You got the headgear?

40:17.984 --> 40:20.023
Nah, I don't need one.

40:21.529 --> 40:24.281
He's gonna get his <i>cojones</i> knocked out.

40:24.407 --> 40:26.150
OK. Ready, guys?

40:26.284 --> 40:29.653
- Benson, go easy, all right?
- Sure. OK, Rocky.

40:29.787 --> 40:31.946
Time!

40:32.081 --> 40:35.533
All right, just go easy now.
Slip the jab now.

40:38.004 --> 40:41.088
- Hey, kid! What's his name again?
- Tommy Gunn.

40:41.215 --> 40:44.169
Tommy, whoa! It ain't no law to duck.

40:45.386 --> 40:47.426
Go side to side. That's it.

40:50.642 --> 40:55.719
- Hey, man, take it easy.
- Come on, lighten up. It's called sparring.

40:56.731 --> 40:59.056
Hey! OK. Hey, kid.

40:59.192 --> 41:01.481
Hey, lighten up! Time out!

41:01.611 --> 41:04.565
Smell that, Rocko?
The odour of opportunity.

41:04.697 --> 41:07.484
Hey, that's it.
What did I tell you? Time!

41:07.617 --> 41:09.693
Hey, that's it. Time!

41:12.080 --> 41:15.614
Hey, back off. That's enough!
What's the matter with you?

41:15.750 --> 41:19.617
- Tommy, are you crazy or something?
- What's the matter with you, man?

41:19.754 --> 41:22.625
- I'm sorry.
- Go cool off, kid. Sorry about this.

41:22.757 --> 41:25.248
He stinks of opportunity, Rocko.

41:25.385 --> 41:28.718
Hey, look,
goin' easy don't mean breakin' bones.

41:28.846 --> 41:32.975
- I'm sorry. But what do you think?
- What do I think? I don't think you listen.

41:33.351 --> 41:36.186
But you brawl
like you was a street fighter.

41:36.312 --> 41:40.096
I know somethin' about that,
but this is boxing. It ain't mugging.

41:40.233 --> 41:45.310
- I'm sorry, but I know I can do it all.
- Yeah? Well, not on this date, OK?

41:45.446 --> 41:49.065
- That's it?
- I gotta work with these kids here.

41:49.784 --> 41:51.824
How about you tryin' to manage me?

41:51.953 --> 41:53.198
- Manage?
- Yeah.

41:53.329 --> 41:56.247
Unless you think I ain't got nothin' goin'.

41:56.374 --> 41:57.833
Nothin' goin'?

41:57.959 --> 42:03.333
Yeah, all right, you got a lot goin'. You got
a lot of tools. But I ain't no manager.

42:03.464 --> 42:06.382
The gentleman that owned
this place was a manager.

42:06.509 --> 42:10.044
But me, I was always the managed... guy.

42:11.306 --> 42:13.761
Hey, look. Good luck, all right?

42:16.269 --> 42:18.676
All right, guys. Let's go.

42:18.813 --> 42:20.853
Come on. Move around.

42:22.025 --> 42:24.064
That's it. Nice.

42:36.748 --> 42:40.164
All right, you guys, come on.
No cheap shots. Move it around.

42:47.675 --> 42:49.834
How you doing?

42:49.969 --> 42:52.425
Cold? You look cold.

42:53.598 --> 42:57.726
I guess it has something
to do with the weather.

42:57.852 --> 43:00.224
Here. Take my coat.

43:00.355 --> 43:03.225
No, thanks. Where's your boyfriend?

43:04.192 --> 43:07.276
Him? Forget it. He ain't got no manners.

43:08.947 --> 43:11.402
I'm Jewel, if you wanna know.

43:13.076 --> 43:15.199
I'm Robert.

43:15.328 --> 43:16.952
Hi.

43:17.747 --> 43:23.536
Well, I been living here about
six years now. It ain't Disneyland!

43:23.670 --> 43:26.421
- You been to Disneyland?
- Sure.

43:26.547 --> 43:29.252
You make it sound like everybody has.

43:29.384 --> 43:34.722
I know you can't tell by the way I look,
but I ain't like the other kids around here.

43:34.847 --> 43:37.718
Why? I mean,
what makes you so different?

43:37.850 --> 43:42.477
I don't know. I guess it's cos
I wanna get out. You know how it is.

43:43.815 --> 43:47.978
You know, for an Italian kid,
you ain't got a bad butt.

43:57.537 --> 44:01.155
- First money I get, I'm goin' to Miami.
- Why Miami?

44:01.291 --> 44:05.787
- Miami needs new gigolos.
- Yeah, I read somethin' like that.

44:08.631 --> 44:12.131
My back is getting bad.
How come <i>you</i> don't have arthritis?

44:12.260 --> 44:15.047
Ain't I got enough?

44:15.179 --> 44:18.133
Adrian's too good for this.

44:18.266 --> 44:20.472
This place really depresses me, Paul.

44:20.602 --> 44:23.805
Yo! Rock. Come inside.
Everybody's been askin' for ya.

44:23.938 --> 44:27.188
- No, thanks. I'm a little beat.
- Hey, I'm a little thirsty.

44:27.317 --> 44:29.143
- You go if you wanna.
- Mr Balboa?

44:29.277 --> 44:32.895
- Look at this. Tommy Gunn.
- Why are you still hanging around?

44:33.031 --> 44:37.776
- Is there something I can do for you?
- Yeah. I'd like to try again.

44:37.911 --> 44:41.908
Kid, I'd like to help, but I really
don't know nothin' about managin'.

44:42.040 --> 44:46.915
Man, all I'm askin' for is a chance.
If I screw up, then hell, I'll leave.

44:47.045 --> 44:51.173
- What have you got to lose?
- Me? Nothin'. It's what <i>you</i> got to lose.

44:51.299 --> 44:53.338
- I got nothin' to lose.
- Maybe you do.

44:53.468 --> 44:57.300
What if I don't do good, right?
And you don't make it?

44:57.430 --> 45:00.716
I don't want you blaming me for this,
kid, you know?

45:00.850 --> 45:05.311
Here's what I would do if I was you.
Listen to me. If I was you,

45:05.438 --> 45:10.017
I would go home and talk to your family
people. Come up with somethin' better.

45:10.151 --> 45:13.485
I got no family people.
All I got is what you see here.

45:13.613 --> 45:17.397
I know all about you, back from
your first fight with Apollo Creed.

45:17.533 --> 45:20.404
I read about how no one
ever gave you a chance.

45:20.536 --> 45:24.368
I'm not from the same streets as you,
but I'm hungry, like you were.

45:24.499 --> 45:26.906
Ever since I put on gloves
I've wanted to meet you.

45:27.043 --> 45:31.372
Cos I knew that if anybody could
make me a winner, it was you.

45:31.506 --> 45:34.423
Hey, Paulie,
you see a winner standing here?

45:34.550 --> 45:38.133
Yes! Man, you beat the best.
Nobody could ever say different.

45:38.263 --> 45:42.343
Look, Rocky, you don't know me,
but anything you want me to do, I'll do.

45:42.475 --> 45:44.800
And if I can't, I'll bust my butt tryin'.

45:44.936 --> 45:51.188
I'm not hustlin' you, man. All I'm askin'
for is a chance. I mean, just one shot.

46:01.077 --> 46:03.319
Are you hungry?

46:04.622 --> 46:06.116
Yeah.

46:06.249 --> 46:09.203
Yeah? Come on.

46:09.335 --> 46:12.170
You're really gonna like
the way Adrian cooks.

46:12.297 --> 46:16.211
She does amazing things with macaroni,
especially tomatoes.

46:16.342 --> 46:20.672
But I gotta warn you,
she can be a little vicious with the garlic!

46:22.348 --> 46:26.891
- So why'd this kid smack your face?
- It really doesn't matter, Dad.

46:27.020 --> 46:30.353
- It does matter. They took his coat.
- I don't want the coat.

46:30.481 --> 46:32.521
They took the one with the collar?

46:32.650 --> 46:35.402
- I'll go to your school and...
- You'll make it worse.

46:35.528 --> 46:38.814
- Can't I do what I think is right?
- What do you think is right?

46:38.948 --> 46:41.819
- A baseball bat across the face.
- Paulie!

46:41.951 --> 46:44.359
- Adrian, can I have the plate?
- Yes, Rocky.

46:44.495 --> 46:47.117
I had trouble like that
when I was in school.

46:47.248 --> 46:51.198
Every day I got chased by this kid,
till one day my mother said to me:

46:51.336 --> 46:54.337
- "Pretend the guy's like a balloon."
- Balloon?

46:54.464 --> 46:58.508
She said if you pop 'em hard,
these guys just go away.

46:59.928 --> 47:03.877
Tommy, we're trying to raise our son
so he can handle his problems

47:04.015 --> 47:06.684
with his mind, not his muscles.

47:06.809 --> 47:08.932
- Sorry.
- That's why I'll get mangled.

47:09.062 --> 47:12.810
- You ain't gonna get mangled.
- Dad, will you teach me how to fight?

47:12.941 --> 47:14.648
A baseball bat would be nice.

47:14.776 --> 47:17.730
Do you wanna grow up
and just use your fists?

47:17.862 --> 47:20.234
Adrian, I don't think it'd be so bad

47:20.365 --> 47:24.445
if I taught him how to throw a few...
deadly punches.

47:24.577 --> 47:27.115
Tommy, did your dad teach you to fight?

47:27.247 --> 47:30.995
- No, not exactly. I had to...
- Sweetheart, don't get personal.

47:31.125 --> 47:34.909
No, it's OK. You see, my old man,
he used to drink a lot. Seriously.

47:35.046 --> 47:39.459
He'd go out with his friends, then
he'd come home, look to punch on me.

47:39.592 --> 47:43.293
He'd punch on my mother, too.
He did that a lot of times.

47:43.429 --> 47:46.798
So growing up,
I only thought about fightin' my father.

47:46.933 --> 47:49.969
You know, when I was 13,
I got in trouble at school.

47:50.103 --> 47:53.602
He tied me down and whipped me
so bad I couldn't walk for a week.

47:53.731 --> 47:56.305
I couldn't do anything.

47:56.442 --> 48:02.196
The first guy I ever knocked out was my
father. In the ring, it's like all I see is him.

48:02.991 --> 48:04.983
That's kinda sick, huh?

48:05.952 --> 48:09.902
Yo, Tommy, at least you had
an old man to knock out, you know?

48:11.916 --> 48:13.956
Yeah.

48:15.128 --> 48:18.544
- I didn't even have that.
- Some day you can punch out <i>your</i> pop.

48:18.673 --> 48:24.296
- Paulie, what you telling him that for?
- It's the fittest of the survival.

48:24.429 --> 48:30.182
- Tommy, where you stayin' tonight?
- Oh, I'll find some place to stay.

48:30.310 --> 48:34.177
No, I tell you what.
We got room down in the basement.

48:34.314 --> 48:36.852
- What about me?
- Your son is sleeping there.

48:36.983 --> 48:41.277
- Well, he can stay with his uncle.
- What am I, a pit stop?

48:41.404 --> 48:44.654
I don't wanna cause any problems.
I can find a place to stay.

48:44.782 --> 48:48.994
No, it's OK.
It's just for a little while, you know.

48:49.120 --> 48:53.663
Right? No problem at all. Hey, kid.
I appreciate it. It's cold outside.

48:53.791 --> 48:58.584
- I'm not changing no sheets.
- Hey, since when have you ever?

48:58.713 --> 49:02.580
Tommy, why don't you come on down?
We'll show you the whole place.

49:02.717 --> 49:07.960
Why don't you go downstairs and
show your father what you did today?

49:11.517 --> 49:14.803
Hey, Junior!
Your plumbing don't leak, do it?

49:21.694 --> 49:24.529
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. He hits hard.

49:27.325 --> 49:30.611
- Adrian can really cook!
- Yeah, she's OK. Listen, Tommy.

49:30.745 --> 49:34.410
We ain't had a chance
to get this place too nice.

49:34.540 --> 49:37.909
We'll get it together in a while, you know?

49:38.044 --> 49:41.128
- Wow! Man, this is what it's about.
- Holy mackerel!

49:41.256 --> 49:44.007
Why do you keep this stuff down here?

49:44.133 --> 49:48.345
When did you get a chance to do this?
He took it all out of a box. It's beautiful.

49:48.471 --> 49:52.136
You painted... When did you
get a chance to do this, kid?

49:52.267 --> 49:56.015
- After school. It's no big deal.
- Where'd you get the glove?

49:56.145 --> 49:59.977
Oh, this? Thanks.
This is one of my favourite objects.

50:00.108 --> 50:04.686
Mickey give me this before he departed.
It was Rocky Marciano's cuff link.

50:04.821 --> 50:08.653
- Really? The real Rocky Marciano?
- You got me thinkin' about Mickey.

50:08.783 --> 50:12.152
I wanna show you something.
He told me a long time ago...

50:12.287 --> 50:17.743
He says that fighting
is like 90% in the skull

50:17.875 --> 50:20.413
and 10% in the body.
This is what he says to me.

50:20.545 --> 50:24.543
- Dad, I met this really nice girl today.
- Really? That's wonderful.

50:24.674 --> 50:28.541
- She's a lot better than...
- Wait a minute. Don't change the station.

50:28.678 --> 50:31.964
I'll be right back.
I just wanna tell Tommy a few things.

50:32.098 --> 50:35.847
Hey, who was your best friend
back in Orlando?

50:35.977 --> 50:39.180
- That's Oklahoma.
- Well, yeah.

50:39.314 --> 50:41.686
- Eric Elder.
- No, no.

50:41.816 --> 50:44.389
Your best friend is
a guy named Frankie Fear.

50:44.527 --> 50:49.154
You see, fear is a fighter's best friend.
It ain't nothin' to be ashamed of.

50:49.282 --> 50:54.323
You see, fear keeps you sharp. It keeps
you awake. It makes you wanna survive.

50:54.454 --> 50:57.823
But the thing is,
you gotta learn how to control it.

50:57.957 --> 51:01.575
Cos fear is like this fire
and it's burning deep inside.

51:01.711 --> 51:04.831
Now, if you control it, Tommy,
it's gonna make you hot.

51:04.964 --> 51:07.669
But, you see,
if this thing here controls you,

51:07.800 --> 51:12.094
it's gonna burn you and everythin'
else around you up. That's right.

51:12.221 --> 51:15.472
Anyway, these are the things
that was taught to me

51:15.600 --> 51:19.099
and, if you want, I'd like to teach to you.

51:19.228 --> 51:21.850
This mean you're gonna manage me?

51:21.981 --> 51:25.231
- Absolutely. Hey, home team.
- All right!

51:25.360 --> 51:28.693
- Let's go for it.
- Do you mind showin' me a few things?

51:28.821 --> 51:31.277
Sure, Tommy. I'll show you a lot of things.

51:36.329 --> 51:39.532
Hey, rich boy.
How much you got in your pocket today?

51:39.666 --> 51:41.575
- Nothin'.
- Come on, let's have it.

51:41.709 --> 51:44.461
- I got nothin'.
- Come on, gimme the money.

51:44.587 --> 51:47.125
- Come on!
- Hey, I gotta eat.

51:47.257 --> 51:50.341
He's hungry, he's gotta eat. Well, eat this.

51:53.304 --> 51:55.511
I got it. Go!

51:55.640 --> 51:57.514
<i>Father Carmine!</i>

51:59.227 --> 52:00.935
Father Carmine!

52:01.062 --> 52:03.518
- Maybe he's not home.
- Priests is always home.

52:08.653 --> 52:11.405
I didn't wanna
disturb you that much, Father.

52:14.033 --> 52:16.904
Oh, excellent. Everything is perfect.

52:17.036 --> 52:19.444
Father, this is my new friend,
Tommy Gunn.

52:24.377 --> 52:28.588
I was wondering... Tommy here's
a fighter and I'm his manager.

52:28.715 --> 52:31.716
I wondered if you'd do me
a favour, if you ain't busy.

52:31.843 --> 52:36.801
Could you throw us a couple blessings?
One, that I don't mess up as a manager.

52:36.931 --> 52:40.549
And B, that Tommy does
as good as I think he can do: Great.

52:40.685 --> 52:43.686
And don't get hurt none.
Could you do that?

52:51.070 --> 52:54.819
I love it when he does that.
Thanks, Father! Really appreciate this.

52:55.116 --> 52:58.983
- Any time.
- OK. I'll see you in church.

53:02.624 --> 53:07.784
- Hey, man, what'd you do this for?
- It don't hurt havin' an angel on your side.

53:11.758 --> 53:14.462
- Hey, Rock. How's it going?
- Doin' great, guys.

53:14.594 --> 53:16.468
Slow down or you'll get a ticket!

53:16.596 --> 53:19.881
- This is Tommy Gunn. He'll be a champ.
- How you doin', Tom?

53:29.984 --> 53:32.855
All right, break it up. Break!

53:45.250 --> 53:47.159
Get off the ropes!

53:54.592 --> 53:56.466
- Go easy.
- Man, I need more work.

53:56.594 --> 53:59.512
- No, you're ready.
- No, this guy's killing me.

53:59.639 --> 54:02.759
- You're ready now. You're perfect.
- He's killing me.

54:02.892 --> 54:05.644
- I feel weak.
- No, listen to me. Shut up!

54:05.770 --> 54:09.388
Mick used to say the only difference
between a hero and a coward

54:09.524 --> 54:12.525
is the hero's willing to go for it.
Take the shot.

54:12.652 --> 54:15.487
This guy here is scared too.
You're both scared.

54:15.613 --> 54:19.825
Remember in the basement we talked
about fear? How it was like this fire?

54:19.951 --> 54:23.699
You gotta control it or it burns you up.
Or it's gonna burn him up.

54:23.830 --> 54:25.739
Make it work for you, Tommy.

54:25.873 --> 54:29.040
I would never do nothin'
to hurt you, understand?

54:29.168 --> 54:33.581
Fear is like this fire, OK? Now let it burn
until it becomes like this volcano.

54:33.715 --> 54:37.415
When you see the openin',
explode all over this guy, OK?

54:37.552 --> 54:41.466
Now, you can take him, OK?
It ain't all muscle, it's all heart.

54:41.598 --> 54:45.465
Heart and fire! OK, now you do it.

54:47.520 --> 54:50.272
Remember,
I'm like this angel on your shoulder.

54:50.398 --> 54:53.601
I ain't gonna let nothin' happen to you.
Go for it.

54:57.864 --> 55:00.485
Come on, Tommy. Jab!

55:04.996 --> 55:07.035
Left, right!

55:07.957 --> 55:09.701
The body!

56:13.690 --> 56:17.308
Go to the body, Tommy. That's it.

56:18.486 --> 56:22.318
Sam, you OK? Hey, Tommy Gunn!
You got some guns, don't ya?

56:39.882 --> 56:42.634
Drive through it. Go on now.

56:51.686 --> 56:53.394
And ten. You can do it.

56:56.774 --> 56:59.728
You got it. Come on, bring it up.

56:59.861 --> 57:02.352
<i>I got you this time!</i>

57:14.125 --> 57:17.079
Tommy, these trunks is
very special to me, you know?

57:19.839 --> 57:20.882
Dig!

57:29.557 --> 57:31.882
Way to go, kid! That was great.

57:32.018 --> 57:34.260
Tommy! Tommy!

57:44.155 --> 57:45.198
All right.

57:55.541 --> 58:00.880
- I beat the man. I don't believe it.
- You sure did. You're very swift, Tommy.

58:10.765 --> 58:16.305
Yeah, Merlin. Listen, I got an idea.
I think we can finally nail Balboa.

58:20.733 --> 58:22.311
They're waitin' again.

58:22.443 --> 58:25.065
- If you want, I got almost a dollar.
- Save it.

58:25.196 --> 58:29.064
- Slummin' again, bimbo?
- Hey, what you got in the bag?

58:29.200 --> 58:33.364
Hey, stupid! What, you not talkin' to me?
I'll pound your teeth out.

58:33.496 --> 58:37.161
- Go for it.
- What'd he say? Punk's losin' his mind.

58:37.292 --> 58:39.664
- What'd you say?
- Go for it!

58:57.729 --> 59:00.302
Come on! Put up your hands.

59:00.440 --> 59:02.895
No way. I didn't like him anyway.

59:06.195 --> 59:08.947
I think that belongs to me.

59:09.073 --> 59:12.573
Robert! Robert!

59:12.702 --> 59:15.407
If you wanna end this, let's end it now.

59:15.538 --> 59:19.536
Yeah, I got no problem with that.
See you later.

59:19.667 --> 59:21.790
I can't believe it.

59:21.920 --> 59:24.624
- Are you gonna tell your dad?
- Yeah.

59:26.925 --> 59:29.380
Good. That's it. One more time.

59:30.511 --> 59:33.085
Look, you're doin' great at combinations,

59:33.222 --> 59:37.054
but you gotta learn to move
side to side like a windshield wiper

59:37.185 --> 59:40.554
- so you ain't gettin' hit with the jabs.
- Dad!

59:40.688 --> 59:43.773
I got my coat back! Look, I got my coat.

59:43.900 --> 59:46.355
Oh, that's great, kid. That's beautiful.

59:46.486 --> 59:50.400
I trashed this guy. Everybody
in the school went crazy. Everybody!

59:50.531 --> 59:54.481
- Rocky, I'm coolin' down over here.
- I gotta get back with Tommy.

59:54.619 --> 59:59.862
He's coolin' down. But go tell your mom.
She'd like to hear that. That's beautiful.

59:59.999 --> 01:00:02.669
OK, let's go, Tommy.

01:00:02.794 --> 01:00:05.036
Lookin' good.

01:00:05.463 --> 01:00:07.919
Look at Tommy go!

01:00:19.185 --> 01:00:22.020
- You think I have a chance at that?
- Absolutely.

01:00:22.146 --> 01:00:27.651
Tommy, anybody who's got two fists
and a good heartbeat, they got a chance.

01:00:35.535 --> 01:00:36.994
You're out!

01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:11.024
Boy, you got hands of gold.
I want to introduce somebody.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.661
That's it. It's over.

01:02:17.512 --> 01:02:18.887
Back him up.

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.343
- That's it!
- There's your boat, Rocks.

01:02:28.481 --> 01:02:30.937
- What boat?
- The one that's sinking.

01:02:46.457 --> 01:02:48.830
Tommy Gunn at the top.

01:02:49.919 --> 01:02:52.126
You come with the Duke,

01:02:52.255 --> 01:02:56.917
you can get the kind of payday fights
Balboa could only dream about.

01:02:57.051 --> 01:02:59.542
To the victor goes the spoils.

01:03:08.813 --> 01:03:10.853
Slip the jab, Tommy!

01:03:15.945 --> 01:03:17.653
Yes.

01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:20.604
You're out!

01:03:22.327 --> 01:03:26.455
- You did great, kid! You did it!
- <i>Now</i> am I gonna get a shot at the title?

01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:29.036
- Yeah, you will real soon.
- Tommy, over here!

01:03:29.167 --> 01:03:30.626
Hey, baby! How are you?

01:03:30.752 --> 01:03:32.958
The winner, at two minutes ten seconds...

01:03:33.087 --> 01:03:35.709
So Rocky, when's Tommy
up against Union Cane?

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.090
- We gotta talk about that.
- Get a life, will ya?

01:03:39.218 --> 01:03:42.884
- Rocko, he ain't worth it, buddy.
- He fought a great fight.

01:03:43.014 --> 01:03:45.683
Your ship has sunk, Rocko. It's sunk.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.571
Must be hung up in traffic.
He should have been here by now.

01:04:05.703 --> 01:04:07.577
- Why?
- It's Christmas.

01:04:07.705 --> 01:04:11.454
- He should be here with his family.
- Maybe he doesn't think it is his family.

01:04:11.584 --> 01:04:15.249
Sure it is. Yo, Adrian, look at this.

01:04:17.423 --> 01:04:20.673
I wanna give this to him.
What do you think?

01:04:20.802 --> 01:04:22.960
I think you've given enough.

01:04:23.096 --> 01:04:26.346
Hey, come on, Adrian.
He's given us some things too.

01:04:26.474 --> 01:04:30.554
He's given us like a second shot, right?
Come on, it's Christmas.

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:37.524
Only in America.
Havin' the best and wearin' the best.

01:04:37.652 --> 01:04:41.151
- But you gotta stay on top.
- Nobody remembers number two.

01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:45.029
- I sure don't.
- I checked with the boxing commission.

01:04:45.159 --> 01:04:49.656
It seems there's no formal contract
between you and Balboa.

01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:51.829
No, nothing. Just a handshake.

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:57.379
This is a complex business. You got to
stay sharp. I don't have to tell you that.

01:04:57.505 --> 01:05:01.503
It's hard livin' in Rocky's shadow,
people callin' you his puppet.

01:05:01.634 --> 01:05:03.342
No one else could do it so long.

01:05:03.469 --> 01:05:08.012
Tommy, I'm afraid that if you
keep goin' the way you're goin',

01:05:08.141 --> 01:05:11.426
you're gonna be
watchin' the parade go by.

01:05:11.561 --> 01:05:15.179
- Exactly.
- You haven't had the big payday yet.

01:05:15.315 --> 01:05:20.522
And you won't until you fight those
top contenders that I do surely own.

01:05:21.195 --> 01:05:23.568
I got the contracts.

01:05:23.698 --> 01:05:25.904
It's a complex business.

01:05:26.034 --> 01:05:28.785
But if you want the best, go with the best.

01:05:28.912 --> 01:05:31.581
- What about Rocky?
- Rocky can still train you.

01:05:31.706 --> 01:05:36.498
My God, he's done a wonderful job.
Now look, here's $20,000.

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:39.083
Take it as an advance.

01:05:40.173 --> 01:05:44.467
Time to put some hustle
behind this muscle. Merry Christmas.

01:05:44.594 --> 01:05:46.633
Merry Christmas.

01:05:48.056 --> 01:05:50.725
Stop the presses!
Yo, Adrian, I can't believe it.

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:55.346
Just come up on the roof, will you?
He just landed there and crashed.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.264
- Who do you think it is?
- Do I hear reindeer on my roof?

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.144
You know...

01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:04.611
Antlers. Unbelievable. It's like a billion...

01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:08.361
Come on. Look who's here.
You know this guy!

01:06:08.493 --> 01:06:11.114
- You got a weird family.
- Don't I know?

01:06:11.246 --> 01:06:16.702
It's gonna be next Christmas before he
gets down. Hey, put it together for Santa!

01:06:16.834 --> 01:06:20.417
- Merry Xmas. Yo, yo, yo!
- I don't think you got it right, Santa.

01:06:20.546 --> 01:06:24.627
- No, no, no. It's "ho, ho, ho!"
- What's the freakin' difference?

01:06:24.759 --> 01:06:29.088
- Where I come from it's "yo, yo, yo!"
- Looks like we got a 90 proof Santa.

01:06:29.222 --> 01:06:33.516
Hey, Santa, tell all the kids
what you've got in the bag for them

01:06:33.643 --> 01:06:37.094
- that you brought from the north.
- I got my laundry.

01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:40.646
- No, you got the wrong bag.
- Come on, Chubby. Get outta the way.

01:06:40.775 --> 01:06:43.183
Let Santa sit down. Come here, little boy.

01:06:43.319 --> 01:06:45.857
- You been nice?
- Uncle Paulie!

01:06:45.989 --> 01:06:50.152
- Kid, why not tell Santa what you need?
- He's stretchin' the clothes, man.

01:06:50.285 --> 01:06:54.282
- I don't need nothin'.
- Come on, kid. Tell Santa what you want.

01:06:54.414 --> 01:06:57.699
That ain't Santa.
It's Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.

01:06:57.834 --> 01:07:00.539
What do you mean?
Why are you talkin' like that?

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:04.881
We're just tryin' to have a good time.
Santa's here and everythin'.

01:07:05.008 --> 01:07:07.214
It's stupid.

01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:11.756
Yo, you know... Come on, it ain't stupid.
We're just tryin' to pretend here.

01:07:11.889 --> 01:07:16.717
You see, you're supposed to be
pretending. It's like this game, right?

01:07:16.853 --> 01:07:19.426
I don't like pretending.
You guys talk to him.

01:07:19.564 --> 01:07:23.609
Hey, kid, I ain't talkin' to them.
I'm talking with <i>you</i> here.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:27.104
See, it's very important that
you spend time with the family

01:07:27.238 --> 01:07:31.984
and have a good time and just get the
spirit goin', you know? It's good, right?

01:07:32.118 --> 01:07:34.574
Good for what? Come on, let's go.

01:07:35.914 --> 01:07:38.369
His friends are here. He doesn't want to.

01:07:38.499 --> 01:07:42.331
- Adrian, I know what he wants.
- How do you know what I want?

01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:45.213
- Cos I know you.
- You know me?

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.379
He thinks he knows me.

01:07:48.885 --> 01:07:53.630
- Look, I ain't celebratin' nothin', OK?
- Hey, wait. What's the matter with you?

01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:58.640
We always done this before. We always
had a good time. It don't have to change.

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:03.597
Do you remember last year, when
we had fun, when we had a good time?

01:08:03.733 --> 01:08:07.067
It ain't last year and
you ain't the same, either.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.318
What?!

01:08:13.576 --> 01:08:16.363
Adrian, what did I do?

01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:18.535
Go talk to him.

01:08:21.376 --> 01:08:23.617
Even I coulda saw this thing happenin'.

01:08:23.752 --> 01:08:26.788
I shoulda went to Miami
when I had the chance.

01:08:28.049 --> 01:08:30.587
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

01:08:31.678 --> 01:08:35.591
Well, you know,
I thought we was supposed to be like...

01:08:35.723 --> 01:08:38.760
You know, be very close.
Hey, come on, kid. I love you.

01:08:38.893 --> 01:08:40.933
No, you don't.

01:08:41.062 --> 01:08:43.635
Sure I do. Remember what the deal was?

01:08:43.773 --> 01:08:47.640
We was supposed to be tight,
like crossed fingers.

01:08:47.777 --> 01:08:51.644
You want you and Tommy to be tight.
That's what you're talkin' about.

01:08:51.781 --> 01:08:53.939
- Oh, don't say that!
- Why can't I say it?

01:08:54.075 --> 01:08:56.447
Since he came
it's Tommy this, Tommy that.

01:08:56.578 --> 01:08:59.448
You got no time for nobody,
so I got no time for you.

01:08:59.581 --> 01:09:02.368
What are you sayin'?
You're like another person.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.127
<i>You're</i> the other person. You said I would
be number one to you and you lied.

01:09:07.255 --> 01:09:09.331
You lied to me and you lied to Mom.

01:09:09.674 --> 01:09:12.960
I never lied to you.
Tommy needed my help.

01:09:13.428 --> 01:09:15.337
So did I.

01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:19.255
And remember when you said to
watch out for scams and deceptions?

01:09:19.392 --> 01:09:20.803
Yeah?

01:09:20.935 --> 01:09:23.805
You're the one that shoulda watched out.

01:09:30.944 --> 01:09:32.523
- Where are you going?
- Out.

01:09:32.654 --> 01:09:34.399
- When'll you be back?
- Later.

01:09:34.532 --> 01:09:36.572
- Later? When?
- Later.

01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:43.868
Season's greetings, Mrs Balboa.

01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:47.788
You take care of these people.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.834
Behold the Santa for all seasons!

01:09:53.551 --> 01:09:55.627
Are you guys lost?

01:09:55.762 --> 01:09:59.095
<i>Au contraire, mon ami.</i>
I know exactly where I am.

01:10:00.808 --> 01:10:05.933
Yo, Rocko! Guess what's comin' to
dinner. Tommy Gunn's got new friends.

01:10:06.064 --> 01:10:08.187
New friends for a new year!

01:10:08.691 --> 01:10:11.776
Oh, please. Oh, Paulie!

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.146
Nice tree. Charming.

01:10:16.157 --> 01:10:20.819
- Hey, Tommy. How you doin'?
- Merry Christmas, milord. Greetings!

01:10:20.954 --> 01:10:22.946
- Yeah, how you doin'?
- Listen.

01:10:23.081 --> 01:10:26.580
I don't want to take up too much time.
Season's greetings.

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:30.292
- Don't need no presents.
- You've done a helluva job with the man.

01:10:30.421 --> 01:10:35.167
Facts are facts. I'd have to be blind
if I didn't see a title shot on the cards.

01:10:35.301 --> 01:10:38.421
- Title shot?
- Right. We'll work beautifully together.

01:10:38.554 --> 01:10:40.843
No problems.

01:10:40.974 --> 01:10:46.644
No friction. Only harmony, huh? It's time
to put some hustle behind this muscle.

01:10:47.397 --> 01:10:50.931
Tommy-boy's got a little something
personal to discuss with you.

01:10:51.067 --> 01:10:54.151
So I'm gonna be sayin' good night.
Merry Christmas.

01:10:54.279 --> 01:10:57.363
- Merry Christmas to you.
- See you soon, huh?

01:10:58.825 --> 01:11:01.316
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up having dinner.

01:11:01.744 --> 01:11:06.371
Hey, that's OK, Tommy. Adrian cooked
something, but it's probably all cold.

01:11:06.499 --> 01:11:11.790
- What we can do is make sandwiches.
- Rocky, I don't wanna make sandwiches.

01:11:11.921 --> 01:11:14.210
Tommy, why did you bring him here?

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.967
He just wanted to come by. Rocky, mind
if I talk to you outside about a few things?

01:11:19.095 --> 01:11:21.135
Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:11:21.264 --> 01:11:23.671
It's getting late.
We have to be there by ten.

01:11:23.808 --> 01:11:26.264
- Rocky...
- No, it's OK.

01:11:29.772 --> 01:11:32.228
Hey, Tommy, what you wanna talk about?

01:11:32.358 --> 01:11:34.434
- Isn't it a long drive?
- Yeah.

01:11:34.569 --> 01:11:37.321
So what do you think?

01:11:37.447 --> 01:11:39.772
- Where'd you get this?
- Duke gave it to me.

01:11:39.908 --> 01:11:41.651
Tommy!

01:11:41.784 --> 01:11:44.620
Hey, maybe you oughta
give this thing back.

01:11:44.746 --> 01:11:46.822
Man, I knew it! I knew you'd say that.

01:11:46.956 --> 01:11:49.708
Give it back? Why?
He likes the way I fight.

01:11:49.834 --> 01:11:51.874
- It's almost ten.
- We'll make it.

01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:54.292
I know, but you see what he's doing here?

01:11:54.422 --> 01:11:58.206
Tommy, hey, don't let him
put nothin' between us, OK?

01:11:58.343 --> 01:12:02.008
Put like what? The guy was
just talkin' about gettin' a shot.

01:12:02.138 --> 01:12:05.637
Look, we don't need him.
I mean, you're gonna get a shot.

01:12:05.767 --> 01:12:07.806
You'll be able to buy ten of these.

01:12:07.936 --> 01:12:11.186
When you gonna wake up?
We're watching the parade go by.

01:12:11.314 --> 01:12:14.019
What parade? What are you talkin' about?

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:18.064
The big time. The way I'm goin',
I won't get a shot for a long time.

01:12:18.196 --> 01:12:21.647
I've got a perfect record.
I'm 22 and 0. Where's the money?

01:12:21.783 --> 01:12:25.615
Where? We haven't made serious money.
And we won't without the man.

01:12:25.745 --> 01:12:30.621
I ain't talkin' about money. It'll be there.
I'm talkin' about your rep, Tommy.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:35.211
- Don't sell out. We don't need this guy.
- Listen. Duke is a wonderful man.

01:12:35.338 --> 01:12:37.580
- Put the top up.
- Forget about the top!

01:12:37.715 --> 01:12:42.424
- I'm signin' papers with him tomorrow.
- You sign them, you're like his property.

01:12:42.553 --> 01:12:47.512
You got no control. This is a dirty
business, full of thieves and gangsters.

01:12:47.642 --> 01:12:53.727
They promise every good young fighter
who comes by, they promise the world.

01:12:53.856 --> 01:12:58.269
And then they suck 'em dry and
they leave 'em in the gutter broke.

01:12:58.403 --> 01:13:00.526
That's the way this business is run.

01:13:00.655 --> 01:13:05.898
Guys like Duke... You know what he is?
He's a vampire. He's livin' off your blood.

01:13:06.035 --> 01:13:09.819
Tommy, you know, the thing I'm
tryin' to do is what Mick done for me.

01:13:09.956 --> 01:13:13.455
He tried to keep me away from
the dirty part of the business,

01:13:13.585 --> 01:13:17.250
- the way I'm tryin' to do for you.
- I ain't you and you ain't Mick.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.674
When are you gonna understand this is
a business? And in business you need...

01:13:21.801 --> 01:13:24.292
- What, brains?
- You said that, not me.

01:13:24.429 --> 01:13:29.256
- You saying I got no brains?
- Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.

01:13:29.392 --> 01:13:32.144
If you wanna keep trainin' me, do it.
If not, don't.

01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:34.808
But it's my way or it's the highway.

01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:36.857
Tommy!

01:13:45.408 --> 01:13:47.981
Rocky, put on your coat.

01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:52.164
Just put on your coat.
Come on. It's not worth it.

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:54.579
Adrian, it is worth it. He's just confused.

01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:57.580
- You don't see what's happening.
- Yeah, I do see!

01:13:57.712 --> 01:14:01.247
- He's twisted around by Duke.
- Come on, it's you. It's not him.

01:14:01.382 --> 01:14:05.676
You can't live backwards or turn back
the clocks. We live now. We live here.

01:14:05.803 --> 01:14:08.721
Hey, I know where we live.
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:14:08.848 --> 01:14:10.888
I'm not as dumb as you think I am.

01:14:11.017 --> 01:14:14.801
I look. You don't think I can smell it?
I see where we are.

01:14:14.938 --> 01:14:19.516
I don't want this no more. I want
somethin' good for the family, not this!

01:14:19.651 --> 01:14:24.063
I don't want this! Did I come back here
and get my brains beat out

01:14:24.197 --> 01:14:29.322
for these guys to say "There goes Balboa,
just another bum in the neighbourhood"?

01:14:29.452 --> 01:14:33.402
- I didn't want this!
- No! Come on, nobody says that.

01:14:33.539 --> 01:14:37.703
I'm sayin' it, Adrian.
I'm sayin' this. I'm sayin' this.

01:14:37.835 --> 01:14:41.880
When that kid was in the ring,
you know what I was doin'? I was winnin'.

01:14:42.006 --> 01:14:44.046
- You were winning?
- Yeah.

01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:47.544
It was my last chance to get
some respect for us, you know?

01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:51.048
- Come on. I respect you.
- You can't respect me.

01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:54.302
- Yes, I do.
- No, you can't! Don't tell me that.

01:14:54.435 --> 01:15:00.189
All those beatings you took in the ring,
I took them with you. I know how you feel.

01:15:00.316 --> 01:15:04.361
I know when somebody like
Tommy comes along, you feel alive.

01:15:04.487 --> 01:15:07.025
But he's not you.
He doesn't have your heart.

01:15:07.156 --> 01:15:12.696
All those fighters you beat, you beat 'em
with heart, not muscle. Mickey knew that.

01:15:12.829 --> 01:15:17.372
That's why you and Mickey were special.
But Mickey's dead.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:22.707
If there's something you wanna pass on,
pass it on to your son, for God's sakes!

01:15:22.839 --> 01:15:24.997
Your son is lost.

01:15:25.133 --> 01:15:27.421
He needs <i>you.</i>

01:15:27.552 --> 01:15:33.056
I know Tommy makes you feel great. He
makes you feel like you're winning again.

01:15:33.182 --> 01:15:35.508
But you're losing us.

01:15:35.643 --> 01:15:38.430
Rocky, you're losing your family!

01:15:45.737 --> 01:15:48.109
I'm sorry.

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:52.367
You know, it was always you and me.
It was always you and me.

01:15:54.787 --> 01:15:56.827
I'm sorry, Adrian.

01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:01.118
I don't know about you guys...

01:16:02.253 --> 01:16:04.293
but I gotta get outta here.

01:16:05.965 --> 01:16:09.334
- What do you say we go to the shore?
- Oh, yeah, great!

01:16:09.469 --> 01:16:12.090
- How are we gonna get there?
- What do you mean?

01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:14.926
We throw our thumbs
in the air and hitchhike.

01:16:15.058 --> 01:16:17.679
- Yo!
- Oh, what's he want?

01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:20.384
- You want me to stay with you?
- No.

01:16:20.521 --> 01:16:24.353
You're right. I got enough problems
with <i>my</i> old man. Come on.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.488
- You ain't gonna hit him, are you?
- No, I ain't gonna hit him.

01:16:30.907 --> 01:16:33.777
Yo, kid. When you start smokin'?

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:39.533
- I don't know. Didn't you ever smoke?
- Uh, yeah. I done a lot of bad things.

01:16:39.666 --> 01:16:41.705
So?

01:16:42.961 --> 01:16:45.452
So I... I wised up.

01:16:45.588 --> 01:16:48.459
OK, so maybe I'll wise up someday too.

01:16:50.635 --> 01:16:55.593
Maybe tonight's a good night
for both of us to start wisin' up.

01:16:56.599 --> 01:16:59.221
- Don't worry about it.
- I gotta worry about it.

01:16:59.352 --> 01:17:01.641
The deal was we were
supposed to be tight.

01:17:01.771 --> 01:17:04.855
What about Tommy?
You're tight with him too, huh?

01:17:06.234 --> 01:17:08.273
Tommy.

01:17:12.031 --> 01:17:14.071
Yeah, well...

01:17:14.909 --> 01:17:17.365
That was yesterday, you know?

01:17:20.832 --> 01:17:23.074
You know, kid...

01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:26.495
Remember you told me
a long time ago about deceptions?

01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:29.085
And I was talking to you about scams?

01:17:29.215 --> 01:17:33.676
I shoulda listened to you.
I was tryin' to teach you, all right?

01:17:33.803 --> 01:17:36.721
But you were teachin' me
and I didn't wise up.

01:17:36.848 --> 01:17:40.976
I didn't know and I made mistakes.
And I do things, you know?

01:17:42.604 --> 01:17:46.304
It bothers me, you know?
I forget a lot of things and I...

01:17:48.568 --> 01:17:50.607
I just...

01:17:59.787 --> 01:18:02.195
Hey, kid.

01:18:03.082 --> 01:18:05.953
I know I made a few mistakes, you know?

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.581
But I would love to hang out
with you again. Just you and me.

01:18:15.595 --> 01:18:17.718
I swear to God.

01:18:17.847 --> 01:18:21.263
It's just gonna be you and me this time.

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:24.850
Home team?

01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:29.398
Yeah. Home team.

01:18:32.445 --> 01:18:36.277
- Hey, kid, you wanna hear a joke?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:38.981
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

01:18:39.118 --> 01:18:41.954
- Tuna fish.
- Tuna fish who?

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.077
You can tune a piano,
but you cannot tune a fish.

01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:49.993
- Well, you're getting better.
- Yeah. That's a good one.

01:18:56.177 --> 01:19:01.005
All right, folks. Lock the door and
hide the kids. It's time to wage war!

01:19:03.726 --> 01:19:06.846
<i>Tommy Gunn is such a student</i>
<i>of Rocky Balboa's style,</i>

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.514
<i>he's been nicknamed</i>
<i>by the press the Clone Ranger.</i>

01:19:11.609 --> 01:19:16.604
- Relax, Rocko. He ain't worth the stress.
- It ain't him, Paulie.

01:19:16.739 --> 01:19:18.198
<i>... turbocharged.</i>

01:19:18.324 --> 01:19:21.527
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:32.120
<i>Looks like the fans are unhappy with</i>
<i>Tommy Gunn for leaving Rocky Balboa.</i>

01:19:32.797 --> 01:19:35.549
Of course.
He's nobody's sweetheart, that kid.

01:19:35.675 --> 01:19:40.052
<i>Weighing in at 242</i>
<i>very impressive pounds,</i>

01:19:40.388 --> 01:19:43.591
the present world heavyweight champion,

01:19:43.725 --> 01:19:46.512
Union Cane!

01:19:48.146 --> 01:19:51.063
- Looks like he's in great shape, don't he?
- Yeah.

01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:54.061
<i>The referee calling</i>
<i>both fighters to the centre.</i>

01:19:54.193 --> 01:19:58.405
Tommy, you're lookin' a little tight.
He's nervous, you know?

01:19:58.531 --> 01:20:01.532
Like the way I felt when
I was fightin' with Apollo.

01:20:01.659 --> 01:20:03.901
Rocko, he ain't you and he never was.

01:20:04.037 --> 01:20:06.113
Give him a break, would you?

01:20:13.171 --> 01:20:17.749
Come on, Tommy. Do what you was told.
In and out. Side to side. Don't eat the jab.

01:20:21.179 --> 01:20:23.302
Off the ropes. Are you blind?

01:20:24.974 --> 01:20:28.639
- He's gettin' hit with everythin'.
- Come on, Cane. Go for it.

01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:30.846
Come on, Tommy. What's the matter?

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:32.522
That's it.

01:20:37.862 --> 01:20:39.606
That's it.

01:20:39.739 --> 01:20:44.816
Slip the jab. Move side to side. Back and
forth, like a metronome. Slip, slide.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.162
That's it.

01:21:00.343 --> 01:21:03.546
You see? He remembers everything.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.092
Come on, Tommy. I'm in there, man.
Do what I'm doin'. Back and forth.

01:21:08.226 --> 01:21:10.468
Side to side. That's it.

01:21:16.317 --> 01:21:18.274
Come on, kid. Don't let him off!

01:21:25.159 --> 01:21:26.702
Dig!

01:21:36.921 --> 01:21:39.839
- Got him!
<i>- The heavyweight champion is down!</i>

01:21:43.094 --> 01:21:44.921
One! Two!

01:21:45.388 --> 01:21:47.428
Three! Four!

01:21:47.557 --> 01:21:49.596
- Five!
- Six!

01:21:49.726 --> 01:21:51.552
- Seven!
- Eight!

01:21:51.978 --> 01:21:54.551
- Nine!
- Ten! You're out!

01:22:03.823 --> 01:22:09.612
Ladies and gentlemen, by way of
a knockout, we have a new champion,

01:22:09.746 --> 01:22:12.450
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

01:22:16.753 --> 01:22:19.374
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>A sensational upset victory.</i>

01:22:19.505 --> 01:22:22.127
<i>You're now champion of the world.</i>
<i>How do you feel?</i>

01:22:22.258 --> 01:22:25.129
<i>Never better. I don't know</i>
<i>what's wrong with these people.</i>

01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:29.010
Because you're not a champeen.
You're a crumb-bum dirt bag.

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:33.683
Come on, Paulie. Give him a break.
He did something wonderful.

01:22:33.811 --> 01:22:36.184
<i>Long live the king!</i>

01:22:36.314 --> 01:22:40.394
<i>I'd like to say thank you. I'd like to</i>
<i>thank the man who made this happen</i>

01:22:40.526 --> 01:22:45.687
<i>and made me believe it could happen.</i>
<i>He's been like an angel on my shoulder.</i>

01:22:46.074 --> 01:22:47.901
<i>Mr George Washington Duke!</i>

01:22:50.828 --> 01:22:55.823
<i>And there you have it. A new champion of</i>
<i>the world, Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.</i>

01:22:55.959 --> 01:22:58.414
<i>I'll tell ya, a big surprise, at least to me,</i>

01:22:58.544 --> 01:23:02.494
<i>that the new champion thanked Duke</i>
<i>and not the guy that got him there.</i>

01:23:02.632 --> 01:23:06.001
<i>- This crowd is not happy.</i>
<i>- Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:13.475
- Rocko, too much TV's bad for the eyes.
- My eyes are OK, Paulie.

01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:16.686
- Well, too much TV is bad for my ears.
- Yeah.

01:23:17.897 --> 01:23:21.147
- Hey, slugger. Good fight, huh?
- It's OK, Dad.

01:23:21.276 --> 01:23:23.648
You're the real champ.
I made this for you.

01:23:23.778 --> 01:23:25.901
Oh, yeah?

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:28.486
Beautiful.

01:23:28.616 --> 01:23:31.403
Rocko, let's put our teeth
around a few brews, OK?

01:23:31.536 --> 01:23:35.035
- I could use the company.
- Yeah, good idea.

01:23:36.082 --> 01:23:39.831
- Think I should go out with Paulie?
- If I can watch TV.

01:23:39.961 --> 01:23:44.457
OK, listen. You can watch TV, OK?
But don't stay up too late.

01:23:44.591 --> 01:23:48.090
- You gotta get them bones growing.
- All right.

01:23:49.304 --> 01:23:52.755
- What a fight! It was somethin'.
- Somethin'.

01:23:53.808 --> 01:23:56.595
I told you you could
give him everything but you.

01:23:56.728 --> 01:24:00.097
- You can't give him your heart.
- Oh, it's OK, Adrian. Really.

01:24:00.231 --> 01:24:03.315
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's... It's all right.

01:24:05.069 --> 01:24:08.154
Hey, kid. Don't you stay up too late, OK?

01:24:09.407 --> 01:24:11.447
Some fight.

01:24:12.327 --> 01:24:14.782
- Are you OK?
- Oh, sure.

01:24:17.206 --> 01:24:19.876
- I won't be out too late.
- OK.

01:24:20.001 --> 01:24:21.958
See you, champ.

01:24:22.086 --> 01:24:25.171
- Have a good time with Uncle Paulie.
- Yeah.

01:24:31.804 --> 01:24:36.383
Let me present the newest, the youngest
heavyweight champion of all time,

01:24:36.517 --> 01:24:38.973
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.849
- Do you think it was too easy?
- I took some shots, but I was never hurt.

01:24:43.983 --> 01:24:46.023
I'm just glad to be the champ.

01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:51.359
Don't you think this looked like more like
a sparring session than a championship?

01:24:51.491 --> 01:24:54.445
- It didn't look like you broke a sweat.
- Very observant.

01:24:54.577 --> 01:24:56.700
Union Cane wasn't feeling that good.

01:24:56.829 --> 01:25:00.958
But Tommy Gunn would have done
the same thing if Union was 100%.

01:25:01.084 --> 01:25:04.500
100%?! He fought like
he didn't have a heartbeat!

01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:06.835
We all know Cane is a paper champion.

01:25:06.965 --> 01:25:10.250
- What do you mean?
- Cane's title was manufactured.

01:25:10.385 --> 01:25:13.670
- He never won it from Balboa.
- Gentlemen, give him a break.

01:25:13.805 --> 01:25:16.925
Tommy, will you ever get out
from under Rocky's shadow?

01:25:17.058 --> 01:25:22.432
- I won the title. What more do you want?
- You gotta fight some real opponents.

01:25:22.563 --> 01:25:24.686
But I beat the best tonight.

01:25:24.816 --> 01:25:28.648
The best? This guy's a bum.
He doesn't even deserve a title shot.

01:25:28.778 --> 01:25:33.903
Gentlemen, whoa! We're gettin' carried
away. Cane was the recognised champ.

01:25:34.033 --> 01:25:36.820
We know the ratings system
can be manipulated.

01:25:36.953 --> 01:25:39.740
Fact is, Tommy Gunn
beat a second-rate fighter

01:25:39.872 --> 01:25:43.372
with so much glass in his jaw,
he oughta be a chandelier.

01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:46.075
This man will prove
to be a great champion.

01:25:46.212 --> 01:25:49.711
He might win a few fights,
but a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.

01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:51.880
No, he's no Rocky Balboa.

01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:55.794
Let's face it. There's only one Balboa.
He was the people's champion.

01:25:56.139 --> 01:25:59.923
But in time Tommy Gunn may be
able to fill his shoes. Next question.

01:26:00.059 --> 01:26:04.139
- Not by fighting stiffs like Cane, he won't.
- I'll fight anybody, anywhere.

01:26:04.272 --> 01:26:06.893
When are you gonna fight a real fighter?

01:26:07.025 --> 01:26:11.770
Gentlemen, come on. Thank you for
coming tonight. We look forward to...

01:26:11.905 --> 01:26:13.944
Hey, Tommy, I got somethin' for ya.

01:26:14.073 --> 01:26:19.744
For your next fight, try the redhead in the
front row. I hear she comes real cheap.

01:26:19.871 --> 01:26:23.951
We look forward to seeing you
at Tommy Gunn's next fight.

01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:26.753
Why did you say Balboa's better?
Do you believe that?

01:26:26.878 --> 01:26:29.583
Of course not. Look, we can't talk in here.

01:26:29.714 --> 01:26:32.798
Who are you gonna fight next, Tommy?

01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:37.219
What the hell happened in there? I won
the damn title and they think I'm a bum!

01:26:37.347 --> 01:26:40.881
- Why didn't you help me?
- When the press is right, they're right.

01:26:41.017 --> 01:26:45.346
I'm as good as Balboa ever was and
I'm tired of being called a damn robot!

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:49.098
Listen, Tommy. You can't fight the press.
I can't fight them.

01:26:49.234 --> 01:26:53.646
As long as they got Balboa on the brain,
he's champ. He fought wars in the ring.

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.068
Tommy, face facts. You're in his shadow.

01:26:56.199 --> 01:26:58.524
- This is your own man talking!
- No, listen.

01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:03.785
There is a way to get the respect you
deserve. Challenge Balboa to fight.

01:27:03.915 --> 01:27:07.995
- George could set it up in just weeks.
- It'd be the greatest fight ever.

01:27:08.127 --> 01:27:11.294
Teacher against student,
old lion against young lion.

01:27:11.422 --> 01:27:14.589
That's the only way you ever
gonna get peace of mind.

01:27:14.717 --> 01:27:19.130
The press will hound you with that man's
legend for as long as you wear gloves.

01:27:19.264 --> 01:27:24.091
You gotta get him into that ring, Tommy,
or you'll keep hearing questions like that.

01:27:24.227 --> 01:27:28.271
You'll start to ask yourself "Could I
take him? Am I really good enough?"

01:27:28.398 --> 01:27:30.437
"Do people think I'm a carbon copy

01:27:30.567 --> 01:27:35.312
or a second-rate pretender who only
got a shot because of my skin tone?"

01:27:35.446 --> 01:27:37.854
Got to challenge
that man to fight, Tommy.

01:27:37.991 --> 01:27:42.902
If he refuses, you gotta insult him! You
gotta dog him, you gotta humiliate him.

01:27:43.037 --> 01:27:48.198
Do whatever you got to do to get him into
that ring! But that's what you got to do.

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:56.330
OK. Blast off. Rollin' silver. And down.

01:27:56.467 --> 01:27:58.875
Andy, these flippers ain't flippin'.

01:27:59.012 --> 01:28:03.424
- That machine cost me a fortune.
- It's costin' me a fortune too.

01:28:03.558 --> 01:28:05.930
- Rocky Balboa!
- What was that?

01:28:06.311 --> 01:28:09.929
Rocky Balboa, there's a man out here
wishin' to speak with you.

01:28:10.064 --> 01:28:12.602
Rocky Balboa!

01:28:14.068 --> 01:28:16.642
Rocko, you know who that is, huh?

01:28:16.779 --> 01:28:19.021
Yeah, I know who that is.

01:28:20.867 --> 01:28:26.656
- Rocky, you need some help?
- No, guys. It ain't no pie-eatin' contest.

01:28:29.083 --> 01:28:31.242
Look what's in the street.

01:28:31.377 --> 01:28:34.627
Tommy, what are you doin' here?
You oughta be celebratin'.

01:28:34.923 --> 01:28:38.338
I'm challenging you to a fight.
Any time, any place, anywhere.

01:28:38.468 --> 01:28:40.377
- Fight?
- That's right.

01:28:40.511 --> 01:28:44.924
You're comin' here with these people
askin' if I wanna throw hands with you?

01:28:45.058 --> 01:28:48.343
- Is that what this is about?
- Yeah. And I ain't nobody's robot.

01:28:48.478 --> 01:28:53.104
Nobody's boy! Now are you accepting
the challenge or are you yellow?

01:28:53.232 --> 01:28:57.313
He has no class. Come on, Rocko.
Hey, he has no class! Come on.

01:29:07.038 --> 01:29:10.703
Hey, it ain't him. You wanna
shoot some eightball or somethin'?

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:13.870
Hey! I ain't through talkin' with you yet!

01:29:14.003 --> 01:29:16.411
Look, I ain't got
no more to say to you, OK?

01:29:16.547 --> 01:29:20.877
- I wanted good things for you.
- The hell you did. You're in it for money.

01:29:21.010 --> 01:29:23.715
I'm tired of people callin' me a robot.

01:29:23.846 --> 01:29:26.883
You thought I was in this
for the money, Tommy?

01:29:27.016 --> 01:29:29.851
We were supposed to be
like brothers, you know?

01:29:29.978 --> 01:29:32.433
You don't know it,
but you got a deception here.

01:29:32.563 --> 01:29:36.941
This guy was usin' you for the bait.
He wants to get you and me in the ring.

01:29:37.068 --> 01:29:40.437
He wants us to fight each other
to make the money.

01:29:40.572 --> 01:29:43.442
He don't care about you
and he don't care about me neither.

01:29:43.575 --> 01:29:46.778
Come on. Enough of the fantasy.
Let's talk reality.

01:29:46.911 --> 01:29:50.494
Rocky Balboa, are you prepared
to accept Tommy's challenge?

01:29:50.623 --> 01:29:55.166
- Tommy...
- Hey! I would have taken you any time.

01:29:55.295 --> 01:29:58.710
- You're a piece of garbage.
- This ain't none of your business.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.960
- None of my business?
- Come on, Paulie. Forget it.

01:30:02.093 --> 01:30:05.343
He spit blood for you,
put you ahead of his own family.

01:30:05.471 --> 01:30:09.339
And you bring these rat bums
around here? Kill his dignity?

01:30:09.475 --> 01:30:13.520
Rocko made you your shot.
He's the real champ. You're just a joke.

01:30:13.646 --> 01:30:15.971
Get out of here before I break your face.

01:30:17.942 --> 01:30:20.018
Paulie?

01:30:21.112 --> 01:30:24.695
- Don't break your hand on that bum!
- Paulie, are you OK?

01:30:24.824 --> 01:30:28.573
You shoulda left him on the street,
where you found him.

01:30:29.329 --> 01:30:33.373
- Merlin, get him outta here.
- Get off of me!

01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:40.087
You knocked him down.
Why don't you knock me down?

01:30:40.214 --> 01:30:44.378
No, in the ring. Tommy Gunn only fights
in the ring! Let's get outta here.

01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:47.844
- My ring's outside.
- Yeah? Let's do it.

01:30:49.474 --> 01:30:51.680
Let's go live.

01:30:58.107 --> 01:31:02.057
- He's a punk, Rocky.
- He's a street fighter. You a prizefighter.

01:31:02.195 --> 01:31:04.733
- Don't be a damn fool.
- You don't own me!

01:31:04.864 --> 01:31:07.438
- You don't own me!
- What's wrong? Take it easy.

01:31:07.575 --> 01:31:10.529
Nobody does! I want my respect.

01:31:10.662 --> 01:31:13.616
Well, come and get it. Come on, Tommy.

01:31:24.759 --> 01:31:27.594
I loved you, man! You know that?

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.504
You and me,
we were supposed to be like this, Tommy.

01:31:31.641 --> 01:31:33.680
You blew it! You...

01:31:43.903 --> 01:31:48.280
Lucky punch. But I told you
never to fight a street fighter fight.

01:31:48.408 --> 01:31:52.357
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- You're always a champ, Rocky. Great.

01:32:29.574 --> 01:32:31.566
Great stuff. This is beautiful.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.485
Mom! It's Dad.

01:32:34.621 --> 01:32:36.946
- He's on television. He's fighting.
- What?!

01:32:38.124 --> 01:32:40.330
Come on, man. Come on.

01:32:42.503 --> 01:32:45.208
Come on, Balboa. Who's your papa now?

01:32:52.138 --> 01:32:54.178
Come on!

01:33:06.027 --> 01:33:08.814
- Rocky, you gotta get up.
- Come on, get up.

01:33:25.672 --> 01:33:27.581
You're out!

01:33:29.259 --> 01:33:31.465
If he dies, he dies.

01:33:31.594 --> 01:33:34.299
You're the champ.
Now get up. One more round.

01:33:38.059 --> 01:33:40.431
Get up! Don't lay down.
Fight this guy hard.

01:33:40.561 --> 01:33:42.638
Come on!

01:33:42.772 --> 01:33:45.345
He's no machine. I didn't hear no bell!

01:33:45.483 --> 01:33:48.817
Get up, you son of a bitch,
cos Mickey loves ya.

01:34:00.707 --> 01:34:02.830
Yo, Tommy!

01:34:05.503 --> 01:34:07.745
I didn't hear no bell.

01:34:08.965 --> 01:34:12.416
- One more round.
- Tommy, get back. Come on.

01:34:12.552 --> 01:34:15.339
- You don't need this.
- You lose, you're finished.

01:34:15.471 --> 01:34:18.009
I got one more round. Come on.

01:34:18.141 --> 01:34:22.388
I'm not gonna knock you out this time.
I'm gonna put you through the street.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.604
- One more round.
- Come on, Rocky.

01:34:35.742 --> 01:34:37.236
Come on, Tommy.

01:34:59.265 --> 01:35:01.305
Come on. Again!

01:35:02.268 --> 01:35:03.727
Come on, Tommy.

01:35:13.446 --> 01:35:15.902
Touch me and I'll sue.

01:35:17.367 --> 01:35:19.406
All right, Rocky. You done it.

01:35:20.912 --> 01:35:24.197
What in the hell are you doing?
Get up. What in the hell?

01:35:48.523 --> 01:35:50.978
Come on, knock the bum out.
He took my room!

01:35:55.613 --> 01:35:57.522
Jab! Jab!

01:35:59.701 --> 01:36:01.777
You're losin' everything. Come on!

01:36:03.955 --> 01:36:05.864
Come on, Dad. You can beat him!

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:11.453
Fight back, you bum!

01:36:20.263 --> 01:36:21.805
Stop!

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.311
Come on, Dad, go for it!

01:36:34.861 --> 01:36:36.688
Hit him, Dad. Come on!

01:36:46.748 --> 01:36:48.787
Hit him, Dad. Come on!

01:36:55.798 --> 01:36:57.341
Go for it!

01:37:17.737 --> 01:37:20.442
Hey, Adrian.
You were right. You were right.

01:37:24.786 --> 01:37:26.944
Goddamn!

01:37:28.915 --> 01:37:31.157
Only in America.

01:37:36.965 --> 01:37:39.752
Hey, Rock! You outclassed the bum, huh?

01:37:45.848 --> 01:37:48.304
Rocky, come on. Don't.

01:37:50.770 --> 01:37:53.012
Touch me and I'll sue.

01:37:54.565 --> 01:37:57.483
Come on, punk. Touch me and I'll sue.

01:38:07.829 --> 01:38:10.071
Sue me for what?

01:38:17.755 --> 01:38:20.128
Hey, yo, Father!

01:38:21.134 --> 01:38:24.051
I love it when he does that.

01:38:40.612 --> 01:38:43.945
- We're gonna be late.
- Come on, Speedy Gonzalez!

01:38:48.703 --> 01:38:51.490
- Come on. You can do better than that.
- No way.

01:38:53.166 --> 01:38:58.540
I don't know. It's like these steps keep
growin' taller every year. My goodness!

01:38:59.589 --> 01:39:02.424
Look at this thing.
As long as this thing is here,

01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:05.302
pigeons is always
gonna have a place to sit.

01:39:05.428 --> 01:39:08.631
I can't believe it.
This is where it all started for me.

01:39:08.765 --> 01:39:11.516
- Runnin' up and down these steps.
- Dad?

01:39:11.643 --> 01:39:15.177
- Dad, we're gonna be late.
- Oh, yeah. OK.

01:39:15.313 --> 01:39:17.519
Hey, wait. What's wrong with your ear?

01:39:17.649 --> 01:39:21.349
- What's wrong with it?
- You got somethin' wrong, like a bump.

01:39:21.486 --> 01:39:23.728
What bump?

01:39:23.863 --> 01:39:25.607
This bump.

01:39:29.077 --> 01:39:32.078
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hey, you deserve it.

01:39:32.205 --> 01:39:35.289
Thank <i>you</i> for being born. Thank you.

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:40.829
- What do you think? The new me?
- Well...

01:39:41.881 --> 01:39:46.045
- You're the daughter I always wanted.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:39:46.177 --> 01:39:50.638
Hey, don't punch me. I'm gettin' brittle
as it is. Look at this, you know?

01:39:50.765 --> 01:39:53.434
I been runnin' up and down
these steps for 20 years.

01:39:53.559 --> 01:39:57.094
And I never knew there was
valuable pictures in this building.

01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:01.691
You're never too old to learn somethin'
new. You're gonna love Picasso.

01:40:01.818 --> 01:40:04.487
Oh, yeah. Well, I love almost everybody.

01:43:53.508 --> 01:43:56.378
