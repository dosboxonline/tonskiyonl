08:28.416 --> 08:30.291
I don't believe it!

08:37.499 --> 08:40.041
- Where've you come from?
- Washington.

08:40.832 --> 08:43.499
- Good to see you.
- You too.

08:45.082 --> 08:49.416
- Do you want to tell me about it?
- About what?

08:49.832 --> 08:53.624
Your stick fighting yesterday.
In the warehouse in Bangkok.

08:53.957 --> 08:56.374
- You saw that?
- Yes.

08:56.707 --> 08:59.499
And today you're working in a monastery.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.374
They let me live here
and I help them with repairs.

09:03.707 --> 09:07.332
- And the stick fighting?
- Some extra money.

09:10.374 --> 09:12.582
I saw you give it to those monks.

09:13.207 --> 09:14.291
You see a lot.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.832
- And who are they?
- They're the reason I'm here.

09:23.791 --> 09:26.791
This is Robert Griggs,
from our embassy here.

09:27.332 --> 09:28.541
John Rambo.

09:29.541 --> 09:30.666
Pleased to meet you.

09:31.541 --> 09:34.332
- You're hard to find.
- Are you keeping track of me?

09:35.541 --> 09:38.541
What does the Colonel say?
Good men are hard to find.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.207
Take a look at these pictures.

09:46.291 --> 09:48.416
I don't know
what you know about Afghanistan.

09:48.749 --> 09:51.749
Most people don't even know where it is.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.374
But over two million civilians,

09:54.541 --> 09:59.749
mainly peasant families,
have been killed by Russian troops.

10:01.082 --> 10:03.374
Many newly developed weapons,

10:06.332 --> 10:09.457
including chemical warfare,
were used to wipe them out.

10:09.832 --> 10:11.874
With great success.

10:13.832 --> 10:17.207
I guess you don't know about
the current state of affairs.

10:18.332 --> 10:20.249
After nine years of fighting

10:20.416 --> 10:25.749
Afghanistan is getting Stinger missiles
to defend against the air strikes.

10:25.916 --> 10:29.624
Except for one region,
80 km behind the border.

10:30.582 --> 10:33.707
The Soviet commander there
seems to be really brutal,

10:33.874 --> 10:35.624
as the photos show.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.916
He prevents
any outside help getting in.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.707
And that's why we'd like to...

10:44.207 --> 10:46.749
check out the problem firsthand.

10:46.916 --> 10:48.666
And what have I got to do with it?

10:50.957 --> 10:54.207
- I'm to go there.
- But you're not going to?

10:54.749 --> 10:57.874
Sure. With you, John.

10:58.957 --> 11:00.166
I put in my time.

11:00.332 --> 11:01.624
What does that mean?

11:03.291 --> 11:04.624
My war is over.

11:16.041 --> 11:19.249
But you said he was a great soldier.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.499
Alright!

11:21.957 --> 11:24.499
It's long way down those stairs.

11:41.166 --> 11:44.582
Don't hold it against him,
he's just obeying orders.

11:45.749 --> 11:48.374
It's an important mission.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.582
- And we can make a difference?
- That's why we're going.

11:51.749 --> 11:55.457
- It didn't work before.
- Those were different times.

11:56.457 --> 11:57.582
Come with me, John.

12:03.082 --> 12:06.957
I don't know what you think,
but I like it here.

12:07.291 --> 12:11.624
I like living and working here.
It's good to belong somewhere.

12:12.124 --> 12:14.666
But you don't belong here.

12:16.291 --> 12:20.166
- When are you coming full circle?
- What do you mean?

12:20.624 --> 12:24.291
You say your war is over.
The war outside maybe,

12:24.624 --> 12:26.707
but not the one inside you.

12:27.207 --> 12:30.416
I know why you're here.
But it doesn't work like that.

12:30.874 --> 12:34.499
You're trying to change yourself,
but you stay who you are.

12:35.041 --> 12:37.582
- And what am I?
- A full-blooded fighter.

12:38.041 --> 12:42.416
- I don't want to be that any more.
- But that's what you are.

12:43.291 --> 12:44.624
Listen, John,

12:45.166 --> 12:49.416
there was once a sculptor
who found a very special stone.

12:49.582 --> 12:53.666
He carried it home and worked on it
for months, until it was finished.

12:54.207 --> 12:58.332
Then he showed it to his friends.
They said: great statue!

12:58.707 --> 13:03.166
But the sculptor said
the statue had always been there.

13:03.499 --> 13:07.207
All he had done
was to knock away a few pieces.

13:07.374 --> 13:10.624
We didn't make you
into a fighting machine.

13:11.082 --> 13:14.124
We just knocked the rough edges off you.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.707
You have to finally
come to terms with yourself!

13:19.374 --> 13:20.832
Until you come full circle.

13:23.791 --> 13:25.374
I guess I'm not ready yet.

13:31.582 --> 13:33.207
I have to go.

13:35.624 --> 13:37.999
Come and see me
when you're next in the States.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.082
I promise.

13:43.957 --> 13:47.332
I'm sorry.
But it has to end for me sometime.

13:49.666 --> 13:50.874
I understand.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.207
<i>Take cover!</i>

15:42.082 --> 15:44.999
<i>Drop your weapons and stand still!</i>

15:46.457 --> 15:48.082
<i>You can't escape!</i>

15:53.832 --> 15:55.541
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

15:56.082 --> 15:57.499
<i>There's no escape!</i>

15:59.874 --> 16:01.291
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

16:02.082 --> 16:03.624
<i>At once!</i>

16:31.874 --> 16:33.041
Something went wrong.

16:33.207 --> 16:37.166
- What happened?
- The Soviets intercepted the team.

16:39.332 --> 16:43.291
Trautman and the others
were taken to the enemy camp.

16:45.082 --> 16:46.166
And now?

16:48.291 --> 16:51.082
I can't do anything.
I'm sorry.

16:52.082 --> 16:54.457
I just thought you should know.

17:00.041 --> 17:02.249
- You?
- Can you get me in?

17:03.332 --> 17:05.999
- You're not serious.
- Of course I am.

17:08.832 --> 17:11.499
Officially it's not possible.
- Then unofficially.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.124
You should know one thing.
If you get taken prisoner

17:17.290 --> 17:18.499
or something leaks out,

17:19.082 --> 17:22.290
we'll deny any knowledge of you.

17:24.415 --> 17:25.915
I'm used to it.

17:27.415 --> 17:28.582
You'll hear from me.

18:53.791 --> 18:56.124
You want buy? Many guns!

18:57.207 --> 18:59.707
No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.

19:00.916 --> 19:03.999
- What's your name?
- John Rambo.

19:07.082 --> 19:08.291
<i>R</i> 7

19:31.041 --> 19:32.249
They sell well here.

19:34.957 --> 19:36.541
Because of the landmines.

19:36.999 --> 19:38.582
Everywhere landmines.

19:40.416 --> 19:44.041
- I am Mousa Chanin. What do you want?
- Griggs sent me.

19:45.916 --> 19:50.957
You don't look like the guys
he usually sends. Soldiers.

19:51.749 --> 19:54.624
- I'm not a soldier.
- Then what? A mercenary?

19:56.666 --> 20:01.541
- No.
- A tourist that lost his way?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.624
I'm not a tourist.

20:11.249 --> 20:13.957
- Sorry.
- Do you know where the American is?

20:14.416 --> 20:16.707
In a Soviet fort.

20:17.499 --> 20:21.041
Near Khost, 30 miles from the border.

20:21.582 --> 20:24.041
Mr. Griggs sent
the supplies you wanted.

20:24.916 --> 20:26.499
- Do you want to see?
- Yes.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.749
- Did you order these?
- Yes.

20:33.874 --> 20:36.291
I've never seen anything like it before.
What are these?

20:36.832 --> 20:39.291
- Detonators.
- And this?

20:43.041 --> 20:45.791
- A blue light.
- What does it do?

20:46.749 --> 20:50.082
- Turns blue.
- I see.

20:51.249 --> 20:53.124
How many men will come with us?

20:53.624 --> 20:55.249
I'm the rescue team.

20:56.249 --> 21:00.916
That's crazy. One isn't enough.
We need more people.

21:02.791 --> 21:05.124
Griggs said you'd take me there.
So do it!

21:06.041 --> 21:10.041
I have to take medicine with me;
if not, many people will die.

21:10.582 --> 21:11.916
Do you understand?

21:13.332 --> 21:15.249
I don't know you,

21:15.791 --> 21:18.624
but from the way you look
you have no experience of war.

21:20.332 --> 21:21.541
Or do you?

21:22.791 --> 21:24.374
I've fired a gun before.

21:28.416 --> 21:29.666
Fired a gun before?

21:30.832 --> 21:35.041
Maybe you should go home again
and think things over.

21:35.541 --> 21:36.957
Very long.

21:41.291 --> 21:42.999
I've done that.

21:44.249 --> 21:45.291
Oh really?

21:47.041 --> 21:49.499
OK, if that's what you want.

21:49.832 --> 21:53.457
But you can't get
that American out alone.

21:54.457 --> 21:57.082
If it doesn't work don't blame me.

21:57.624 --> 21:58.999
I'm not taking the responsibility.

22:01.541 --> 22:02.874
Sounds familiar.

22:38.082 --> 22:42.416
I am Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.

22:46.416 --> 22:50.582
You're the first American
to be captured in Afghanistan.

22:51.082 --> 22:52.957
Congratulations.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.207
I believe you plan
to supply the enemy rebels

22:57.374 --> 23:00.957
with Stinger missiles
to destroy Soviet aircraft.

23:01.874 --> 23:05.832
I'll only answer to your superiors.

23:07.874 --> 23:10.874
Out here I have no superiors.

23:12.666 --> 23:13.957
I am in full command.

23:16.457 --> 23:18.999
You're on your own,

23:22.666 --> 23:24.541
abandoned by your government.

23:26.457 --> 23:29.874
- What do you want?
- Cooperation.

23:32.457 --> 23:36.957
This sector has been controlled by us
for five years.

23:39.207 --> 23:41.832
There's not much left for me to do.

23:42.541 --> 23:46.499
There is, so to speak,
no challenge any more.

23:49.957 --> 23:54.541
If you give me information
about the planned Stinger deliveries,

23:54.916 --> 23:57.499
we could both get out of here.

23:58.916 --> 24:02.999
After all, that is what we all want:

24:04.541 --> 24:05.624
peace.

24:06.541 --> 24:08.461
In the Kremlin
they really have a sense of humor.

24:09.957 --> 24:10.999
Explain.

24:11.666 --> 24:16.832
To the world you talk about peace,
and here you butcher a whole people.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.749
We're not butchering anyone.

24:20.832 --> 24:25.124
You're too intelligent
to believe that propaganda!

24:26.499 --> 24:28.416
Again: where are the missiles?

24:28.582 --> 24:31.707
- I don't know anything about missiles!
- Of course!

24:32.041 --> 24:34.916
But you don't understand
that I can get us out of here.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.499
Do you want sympathy?

24:38.457 --> 24:40.041
After all, you started this war!

24:40.624 --> 24:44.874
It's just a question of time
until we have total victory.

24:45.416 --> 24:50.541
There won't be any victory.
You're losing ground every day

24:50.874 --> 24:52.499
to badly equipped freedom-fighters!

24:52.666 --> 24:55.291
You simply underestimated
the competition.

24:55.957 --> 24:58.957
Didn't you take history at school?
This region was always independent!

24:59.374 --> 25:03.166
They prefer to die rather than
become slaves to occupying forces.

25:03.749 --> 25:05.499
You can't conquer a people like that.

25:05.832 --> 25:08.707
We tried it.
We had our Vietnam!

25:10.041 --> 25:12.291
- Now you've got yours!
- Oh, I see.

25:13.166 --> 25:15.499
You want to test me.
Good.

25:55.082 --> 25:57.499
This is Afghanistan.

25:58.082 --> 26:00.374
Alexander the Great
tried to conquer it,

26:00.541 --> 26:04.791
then Ghenghis Khan,
the English and now the Russians.

26:05.957 --> 26:08.666
But the Afghan people
can't be conquered.

26:09.749 --> 26:12.999
An old enemy wrote a prayer about us.
Do you want to hear it?

26:14.457 --> 26:17.374
Very well. It goes like this:

26:17.707 --> 26:19.957
â€œMay God deliver us
from the cobra's venom,

26:20.499 --> 26:23.624
from the tiger's teeth,
and the Afghan's vengeance.â€œ

26:25.707 --> 26:27.374
Do you understand that?

26:28.916 --> 26:31.374
That you don't take any shit.

26:32.707 --> 26:35.374
Something like this.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.249
Go on!

27:16.166 --> 27:18.749
In the north there are lots of caves
that we can use.

27:19.707 --> 27:21.707
It'll be safer. Let's go!

27:26.416 --> 27:28.666
This cave leads
to the â€œValley of the Five Lions...

27:29.457 --> 27:34.291
The Afghan king was supposed
to send 500 warriors into battle.

27:34.624 --> 27:36.332
He only sent five.

27:39.207 --> 27:41.874
The five best, and they won.

27:42.416 --> 27:45.499
He said,
better five lions than 500 sheep.

27:45.832 --> 27:49.957
- What d'you think of that?
- The king was lucky.

27:51.541 --> 27:54.791
- How much longer till the village?
- About two hours.

28:06.124 --> 28:09.332
Where in my sector
are the missiles being delivered?

28:13.374 --> 28:14.499
I don't know.

28:15.541 --> 28:17.166
You're lying.

28:27.041 --> 28:28.416
OK, I'll tell you.

28:30.499 --> 28:33.416
I knew you were lying.

28:33.582 --> 28:37.791
So, where are the missiles?

28:39.332 --> 28:40.374
Real close.

28:41.082 --> 28:42.207
How close?

28:44.582 --> 28:45.707
In your ass.

28:58.749 --> 29:01.707
You've tested
my patience long enough.

29:09.166 --> 29:12.582
Up till now
I've behaved in a civilized way.

29:43.541 --> 29:44.999
The name John Rambo,

29:50.166 --> 29:52.166
have you heard it before?

29:56.041 --> 30:00.749
He says a rescue attempt
is being planned with rebel help.

30:01.457 --> 30:04.916
He says he knows
where this man is heading.

30:09.249 --> 30:10.332
We will welcome him.

30:29.666 --> 30:33.666
It's the last village in the valley.
100 people live here.

30:35.332 --> 30:39.457
- Lots of kids.
- Yes, they are good fighters, too.

30:40.499 --> 30:43.166
I'll tell the leaders
we want to talk to them.

30:48.499 --> 30:50.499
They've never seen
a man like you here before.

30:58.416 --> 31:02.749
They're Mujahedin horsemen.
At the border there are 10,000 more.

31:03.499 --> 31:06.999
They are waiting there for weapons,
then they'll come and fight here.

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
Let's go to the hospital.

31:33.041 --> 31:36.207
He is the only doctor
for 500 km.

31:39.374 --> 31:41.957
The first medication
for two months.

31:50.666 --> 31:54.332
More gifts from the Soviets: mines.
They look like toys.

31:54.832 --> 31:58.832
Some children learn too late
that they're not.

32:03.707 --> 32:05.666
That's Uri. He's Russian.

32:06.124 --> 32:07.166
A deserter?

32:07.541 --> 32:10.249
A defector.
There are lots of them.

32:10.416 --> 32:14.291
He can help us best;
he knows the inside of the fort.

32:18.624 --> 32:20.166
We'd better leave now.

32:39.832 --> 32:45.749
This is where the mines start:
one meter here, then two meters there,

32:46.082 --> 32:47.291
then round here.

32:47.874 --> 32:50.374
There are four watchtowers
with four guards,

32:50.957 --> 32:53.749
here, here, here and here.

32:54.707 --> 32:57.124
- Where are the prisoners?
- Here.

32:58.249 --> 33:01.332
Once we're in,
is there another way out?

33:02.291 --> 33:04.999
Underground,
where the dirty water is.

33:05.332 --> 33:07.749
I don't know the right word.

33:08.124 --> 33:10.416
He means the sewer.
Where is it?

33:10.916 --> 33:15.124
Here. It comes out here.
There are guards patrolling.

33:16.041 --> 33:17.791
Better not to go that way.

33:18.416 --> 33:20.749
Then we'll go through the minefield.

33:21.166 --> 33:25.749
That's impossible.
It's full of Spetnaz commandos.

33:26.082 --> 33:29.291
We're just a few,
we've lost many men already.

33:29.832 --> 33:34.041
- We'll lose more that way.
- I don't need many men.

33:35.166 --> 33:36.374
What's your plan?

33:37.832 --> 33:40.916
Two men for the minefield,
two for the rescue.

33:41.082 --> 33:44.541
The Soviets will come back again

33:44.707 --> 33:48.291
- and more people will die.
- I can't wait.

33:48.749 --> 33:51.124
You have to wait for help like us.

33:53.416 --> 33:56.166
- Then I'll go alone.
- You will die!

33:59.082 --> 34:00.374
Then I'll die.

34:06.124 --> 34:07.207
Wait!

34:08.916 --> 34:10.041
Please don't go.

34:18.248 --> 34:19.873
My name is Masoud.

34:21.248 --> 34:25.956
Let me explain
why we can't help you.

34:27.873 --> 34:30.166
Most Afghans are very strong

34:30.498 --> 34:34.748
and we don't want to be
driven out of our country.

34:34.916 --> 34:40.081
Our children are dying
of disease, mines, poison gas.

34:40.248 --> 34:43.041
Our women are being raped and killed.

34:43.456 --> 34:47.916
Last year, in the Legman valley,
the next valley,

34:48.248 --> 34:50.456
6,000 Afghans were killed.

34:51.498 --> 34:55.041
Pregnant women were bayoneted

34:55.581 --> 34:57.707
and their babies thrown in the fire.

34:58.666 --> 35:02.999
They do that so that there can be
no new generation of Afghans.

35:03.582 --> 35:06.749
But nobody sees it and
the papers don't report it.

35:08.582 --> 35:11.041
The men you see here

35:11.582 --> 35:13.541
are Mujahedin,

35:13.957 --> 35:15.499
holy warriors.

35:15.957 --> 35:18.791
This war is a holy war for us.

35:19.124 --> 35:24.124
For a Mujahedin there is no death,
because we have already

35:24.707 --> 35:27.499
made our peace with God
and consider ourselves dead.

35:28.541 --> 35:31.999
For us, dying for our country
and for God is an honor.

35:32.541 --> 35:33.999
That, my friend, is why

35:35.207 --> 35:39.916
we must stop the murder of our families.

35:41.666 --> 35:43.957
If we succeed in freeing the man

35:44.457 --> 35:49.957
and he tells the free world
that our war here is necessary,

35:50.499 --> 35:51.999
then of course we will help.

35:54.666 --> 35:59.207
Let us now discuss amongst ourselves

35:59.707 --> 36:02.207
how we can best free the man.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.624
- Thank you.
- We thank you.

36:34.874 --> 36:37.916
Don't worry,
they'll soon make a decision.

36:38.249 --> 36:41.541
- We have to leave this evening.
- What's your name?

36:44.457 --> 36:46.999
This boy is very hard inside.

36:47.332 --> 36:50.082
His parents were killed last year.

36:50.416 --> 36:53.166
His brother died in the fort
where the American is.

36:53.499 --> 36:56.499
He looks like a boy,
but he fights like a man.

36:56.999 --> 36:59.374
- What's your name?
- Rambo.

36:59.541 --> 37:02.416
- Where do you come from?
- Arizona.

37:02.832 --> 37:07.041
- Arizona? How many days' walk from here?
- Two years.

37:07.582 --> 37:08.916
Two years...

37:10.166 --> 37:13.999
- Are you a soldier?
- No, not any more.

37:14.541 --> 37:17.207
I am a soldier.
Are you here to fight?

37:17.749 --> 37:20.957
- No.
- Are you scared?

37:25.874 --> 37:28.082
- A knife.
- Can I see? -Sure.

37:36.499 --> 37:38.082
Very good. Can I have it?

37:38.249 --> 37:39.416
No-

37:41.499 --> 37:43.582
- What's this?
- You want everything.

37:43.916 --> 37:46.624
- It brings luck.
- What is luck?

37:46.957 --> 37:48.624
Luck is...

37:50.707 --> 37:54.457
- Can I have it? I need luck.
- Me too.

37:57.957 --> 38:01.207
What a child! He's always like that.

38:04.207 --> 38:07.041
Look! Our national sport.

38:07.541 --> 38:10.832
An old, insane game,
maybe 3,000 years old.

38:11.207 --> 38:12.416
They play non-stop.

38:16.707 --> 38:19.249
War or not, it doesn't matter.

38:19.749 --> 38:22.582
- Do you like it?
- I prefer football.

38:22.749 --> 38:25.916
What is football?
Do you play it with your feet?

38:26.416 --> 38:27.582
Not really.

38:38.541 --> 38:39.666
Let's

38:51.707 --> 38:54.707
- What are they saying?
- They want you to try it.

38:55.291 --> 38:58.957
It's a way of welcoming you.
Try it if you want,

38:59.582 --> 39:01.791
but I'm not taking the responsibility.

39:05.916 --> 39:07.791
- <i>I'll</i> try it.
- Yes?

39:09.999 --> 39:13.582
- How does it go?
- The sheep has to be carried round once

39:13.916 --> 39:17.332
and then thrown in the circle.

39:17.499 --> 39:19.749
- Why?
- Because there is a circle there.

39:21.957 --> 39:24.166
- And that's all?
- Very simple.

39:26.832 --> 39:30.249
- Like football.
- God must love crazy people!

39:31.082 --> 39:34.124
- Why?
- He made so many of them!

47:11.874 --> 47:13.457
That's how it is here.

47:15.082 --> 47:18.082
In every war there's supposed
to be a kind of honor.

47:18.499 --> 47:20.999
Where is the honor here? Where?

47:23.999 --> 47:26.999
We're taking the survivors
to the border. Are you coming?

47:28.666 --> 47:29.999
I'm going to the fort.

47:30.749 --> 47:32.416
Haven't you seen enough death?

47:33.207 --> 47:37.749
Go away while you still can.
This is not your war.

47:41.041 --> 47:42.249
Now it is.

47:46.457 --> 47:47.999
Then so be it.

47:49.874 --> 47:50.999
We are friends.

48:01.791 --> 48:04.457
I'll stay and show you the way.

48:04.791 --> 48:06.249
I'm coming too.

48:07.332 --> 48:08.416
No-

48:08.582 --> 48:13.374
Yes I am. My family is dead.
I want to fight!

48:14.457 --> 48:17.207
Not with me. Go away!

48:18.541 --> 48:19.582
Go on.

48:24.832 --> 48:25.999
Why are you doing this?

48:28.249 --> 48:29.916
Because he would do it for me.

48:55.832 --> 48:57.416
Are you finally going to talk?

49:01.207 --> 49:02.249
Alright.

49:03.332 --> 49:06.416
If that's the way you want it.

50:39.582 --> 50:40.832
- Go back!
- No!

50:41.374 --> 50:42.374
1'
AL

51:10.957 --> 51:12.499
Go on!

51:14.874 --> 51:17.457
- Stay here!
- I know the place. You need me.

51:17.624 --> 51:20.332
But not dead. Go back.
Understand?

58:23.124 --> 58:24.666
American?

58:25.916 --> 58:27.457
American?

58:49.749 --> 58:51.541
Colonel? Colonel?

58:57.791 --> 58:59.874
John! How did you get in here?

59:00.041 --> 59:02.791
- Can you move?
- And how.

59:04.957 --> 59:06.041
Let's

59:11.082 --> 59:12.624
Behind you!

59:29.999 --> 59:31.791
John, get out of here!

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:30.249
Over here!

01:01:31.999 --> 01:01:33.541
Go on!

01:01:39.916 --> 01:01:41.457
Help me!

01:02:39.332 --> 01:02:40.957
Come on!

01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:45.957
The boy!

01:03:18.999 --> 01:03:20.541
Come on!

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.541
Take the boy!

01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:27.957
Jump down!

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.666
The troops are ready,

01:04:31.832 --> 01:04:33.457
Colonel.

01:04:33.624 --> 01:04:35.416
Trace them.

01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:42.666
Give me the boy!

01:05:37.832 --> 01:05:41.749
Who is this terrorist?
What makes you so valuable to him?

01:05:42.249 --> 01:05:46.041
He wanted to destroy me.
But he failed!

01:05:46.207 --> 01:05:50.457
I'll get him at sunrise
and hang his skin on the wall!

01:05:50.999 --> 01:05:53.457
- You don't have to hunt him.
- What?

01:05:54.749 --> 01:05:56.082
He'll find you.

01:05:59.374 --> 01:06:00.999
Are you insane?

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:05.207
One man against a whole trained force?

01:06:05.749 --> 01:06:09.791
Who do you think this man is?
God?

01:06:11.207 --> 01:06:14.374
No. God would have mercy. He won't.

01:06:28.874 --> 01:06:31.541
- Everything's OK. There's no-one here.
- Good.

01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:36.249
This will hold a while.
What's the fastest way out of here?

01:06:36.416 --> 01:06:39.291
Northwest there's a mountain trail,

01:06:40.082 --> 01:06:44.166
about three kilometers from here.
A very difficult path.

01:06:45.499 --> 01:06:48.249
- You take the boy and go.
- I want to stay here.

01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:50.166
You can't.

01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:55.207
You can't go back.
We must all go to Pakistan.

01:06:56.124 --> 01:07:00.457
- No, I have to go back.
- I know he's your friend.

01:07:00.874 --> 01:07:04.457
- But you'll both die. For what?
- Do as I say.

01:07:07.207 --> 01:07:09.082
Give me your gun.

01:07:14.957 --> 01:07:16.291
Let's go. Come on!

01:07:34.957 --> 01:07:36.374
Will I see you again?

01:07:37.999 --> 01:07:39.541
Sure.

01:10:19.207 --> 01:10:20.416
Sweep the area.

01:10:20.582 --> 01:10:21.916
At your command.

01:10:28.999 --> 01:10:32.082
No sign of him, Colonel.

01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:36.666
Keep on searching.
I need to refuel.

01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:37.291
Come on, let's go!

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:50.957
- Can you fly that thing?
- We'll see.

01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:17.332
Let's go.

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:57.582
Over there!

01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:28.957
Take my hand!

01:15:53.791 --> 01:15:55.041
We're going down!

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.666
Take what you can!

01:16:29.832 --> 01:16:31.999
- Move! Fast!
- Come on!

01:16:44.999 --> 01:16:47.374
- We have to get to the border.
- We'll stay here.

01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:49.291
We know the area.

01:16:49.707 --> 01:16:52.666
- Which direction?
- Northeast.

01:17:06.666 --> 01:17:09.791
All troops should get ready!

01:17:09.957 --> 01:17:12.707
They shouldn't reach the border.

01:17:40.499 --> 01:17:42.457
Hold it, John!

01:17:45.332 --> 01:17:46.624
I have to rest.

01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:53.332
- How's your wound?
- You taught me to ignore pain.

01:17:53.707 --> 01:17:57.166
- And does it work?
- Not really.

01:17:59.082 --> 01:18:00.707
Don't take it personally.

01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:03.832
Thanks.

01:18:24.082 --> 01:18:26.666
Go on ahead and see
if you can find some cover.

01:19:38.957 --> 01:19:41.499
That was close! How are you?

01:19:42.124 --> 01:19:43.666
<i>R</i> 7

01:19:54.874 --> 01:19:57.916
We shouldn't make it too easy for them.
Let's separate!

01:19:59.124 --> 01:20:01.332
I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:20:01.874 --> 01:20:03.416
No, you're not.

01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:59.832
Spetnaz, report!

01:21:04.082 --> 01:21:07.124
<i>- Are you listening?</i>
- <i>Who are</i> you?

01:21:08.874 --> 01:21:10.541
Your worst nightmare.

01:21:57.041 --> 01:21:58.874
Kourov, what happened?

01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:07.874
- Good timing!
- What are friends for?

01:23:09.999 --> 01:23:12.249
Go back to the hole.
I'll cover you.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:19.374
Yankov, go back to the base!

01:26:30.124 --> 01:26:32.707
Beyond the valley is the border.

01:26:34.082 --> 01:26:35.916
We did it, John.

01:26:37.624 --> 01:26:38.624
Wait a minute!

01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:49.582
That son of a bitch!

01:27:15.707 --> 01:27:17.916
<i>Don't try to escape!</i>

01:27:18.707 --> 01:27:20.041
<i>You can't escape.</i>

01:27:20.582 --> 01:27:22.624
<i>We will only attack if you run away!</i>

01:27:23.249 --> 01:27:25.166
<i>We don't want to harm you!</i>

01:27:25.582 --> 01:27:27.041
Somehow I don't believe him.

01:27:27.207 --> 01:27:31.249
Come <i>forward
and you will get a fair trial.</i>

01:27:31.832 --> 01:27:34.249
<i>Drop your weapons and stay put!</i>

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.082
Any suggestions?

01:27:37.707 --> 01:27:39.166
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

01:27:40.707 --> 01:27:43.124
Surrounding them's out.

01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:46.874
Helluva time for humor.

01:27:47.041 --> 01:27:49.374
<i>Drop your weapons! At once!</i>

01:27:51.082 --> 01:27:52.916
<i>You cannot escape.</i>

01:27:53.082 --> 01:27:57.166
Come <i>forward!
I want you alive.</i>

01:27:57.624 --> 01:27:59.457
<i>This is your last warning!</i>

01:28:02.957 --> 01:28:04.624
<i>It's your choice.</i>

01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:06.082
What do you say?

01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:10.791
Fuck 'em!

01:28:28.874 --> 01:28:31.041
If we're going to go,
that bastard should go with us!

01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:22.332
The rebels!

01:29:34.666 --> 01:29:36.207
Come on!

01:33:20.374 --> 01:33:21.957
Get out of there, John!

01:34:57.207 --> 01:35:00.541
Don't you want to stay?
You fight well for a tourist.

01:35:03.541 --> 01:35:06.082
Maybe next time.

01:35:06.416 --> 01:35:07.957
Do you want it back?

01:35:09.124 --> 01:35:11.582
No. Keep it.

01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:13.749
Can't you stay here?

01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:29.082
I have to go.

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:55.416
Goodbye.

01:36:03.749 --> 01:36:06.541
- Hard to believe, John.
- What, sir?

01:36:07.541 --> 01:36:10.874
I hate to admit it,
but we seem to be getting soft.

01:36:12.582 --> 01:36:15.666
Just a little, sir.
