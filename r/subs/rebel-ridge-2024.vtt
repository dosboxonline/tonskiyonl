01:08.333 --> 01:10.750
On the ground!
- Wait! You hit me!

01:10.750 --> 01:13.333
Get on your fucking face now!
- Okay, okay!

01:13.333 --> 01:15.458
Stay on your belly!
- What's going on?

01:15.458 --> 01:16.916
Just stay on your belly!

01:18.625 --> 01:22.458
108. 10-26.
Pursuit terminated on Coleman Road.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.125
South side of Fern Creek Bridge.
Possible 10-52.

01:25.125 --> 01:27.541
Pursuit? I never even saw you, Officer.
I would've stopped.

01:27.541 --> 01:28.583
Arms out!

01:28.583 --> 01:30.625
Arms out like a fucking airplane!

01:30.625 --> 01:32.166
What's the deal, Ev?

01:32.791 --> 01:33.708
Flaggin' this?

01:33.708 --> 01:34.625
No.

01:35.458 --> 01:37.291
Picked him up crossing 13.

01:37.791 --> 01:39.583
Lit him up. He tore ass.

01:39.583 --> 01:42.375
If you're saying I fled,
that's bullshit. I couldn't hear.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.916
I was behind you two miles!
Ran code the whole time.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.166
- You tase him?
- Nope.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.250
It's not too late. You want to get tased?

01:49.250 --> 01:51.458
No, sir. I'd just like to know what I did.

01:51.458 --> 01:53.416
- Is that your bike?
Yes, sir.

01:53.416 --> 01:55.875
- We got a report of a stolen bike.
- Can I see it?

01:55.875 --> 01:57.083
You got a mouth on you.

01:57.083 --> 01:59.791
I tried to pull you over, and you fled.

01:59.791 --> 02:01.208
Now come on. Get up.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.458
I'm gonna put my hands in your pockets.
I'm not gonna get stuck?

02:07.458 --> 02:09.291
- No.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.541
Here.

02:17.208 --> 02:19.083
- You have any warrants?
- No.

02:19.708 --> 02:22.250
I'm gonna check your backpack
for any weapons.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.666
You can't do that.

02:24.291 --> 02:27.500
- I can if it's in your immediate control.
- So take it off.

02:27.500 --> 02:31.041
I'd have to uncuff you.
That wouldn't be safe for either of us.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.708
No hits.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.125
That a star and crescent on your arm?

02:48.125 --> 02:49.416
No, it's something else.

02:49.416 --> 02:52.333
I lost some buddies, who served in Iraq.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.291
Yeah, so did I.

02:57.250 --> 03:00.333
Ooh, what's this?
It's not a weapon.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.208
- It's not Chinese food.
- I didn't say it was.

03:04.708 --> 03:05.791
May I look inside?

03:06.416 --> 03:07.541
No, you may not.

03:09.375 --> 03:12.541
Look, I can get a K-9 unit here,
or you can give me consent to search.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.000
K-9.
- I'll get Kyle on the horn.

03:16.625 --> 03:19.000
I'm gonna have to
ask you to take a seat.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.291
Watch your head.

03:23.291 --> 03:26.125
He's got Ziggy at the vet.
Hips are shot!

03:27.208 --> 03:29.250
- Call Aurora. See if they can send theirs.
- Copy.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.541
How long is this gonna take?

03:31.125 --> 03:32.500
You got somewhere you gotta be?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.458
Yes, I do.

03:33.458 --> 03:36.708
Comin' from the city, probably 45.
Maybe an hour?

03:37.375 --> 03:39.875
- Am I under arrest?
- You're currently being detained.

03:39.875 --> 03:43.583
Okay, so if I let you search through it,
and there's nothing illegal, I can go?

03:43.583 --> 03:46.208
Look, I'll make that determination,
but I can say

03:46.208 --> 03:49.416
the more cooperative you are, the better.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.291
All right, you can search it.

03:55.166 --> 03:58.500
- Steve, 10-22 that K-9 unit.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.541
Hey, man, I haven't done anything wrong.

04:32.958 --> 04:35.458
- That's a lot of cash you got on you.
- It's not illegal.

04:35.458 --> 04:37.291
But drug currency is illegal.

04:37.291 --> 04:38.916
It's a good thing it's not that.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.416
- You delivering it?
- Yes.

04:40.416 --> 04:41.416
For somebody else?

04:41.416 --> 04:44.458
No, for my cousin, but it's mine.
I'm posting his bail.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.125
- You going to Town Hall?
- Courthouse.

04:47.125 --> 04:48.125
Same building.

04:48.125 --> 04:51.750
Okay. Listen,
I need to be there before 5:00.

04:52.833 --> 04:53.791
What can I do?

04:53.791 --> 04:57.083
That's over $30,000 dollars.
What's your cousin in for?

04:57.083 --> 04:59.083
Ten is for bail, and the rest,

04:59.750 --> 05:01.958
we're going to buy a truck,
and haul boats.

05:01.958 --> 05:04.208
I'm not a criminal.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.875
Your cousin is.
You didn't answer the question.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.083
What's he in for?

05:09.291 --> 05:10.375
Possession.

05:10.375 --> 05:13.583
But it was just weed,
and he doesn't sell, so...

05:21.166 --> 05:22.083
All right.

05:25.208 --> 05:28.166
For the traffic violation,
I'm gonna let you off with a warning.

05:30.583 --> 05:31.833
Thank you, Officer.

05:31.833 --> 05:34.208
I assume you're aware
that when you ride a bicycle,

05:34.208 --> 05:37.833
you're beholden
to the same laws as a motor vehicle.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.000
Yes, sir. Understood.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.541
This your address?

05:42.541 --> 05:45.041
Pulled up stakes,
but I'll let you know where I land.

05:45.541 --> 05:46.500
Please do.

05:47.541 --> 05:50.333
Now, we're going to hold on to this money.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.791
We've concluded from our investigation
that this is drug currency.

05:53.791 --> 05:55.583
- No.

05:55.583 --> 05:59.000
Or I have you on felony evasion
and conspiracy.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.041
Conspiracy?

06:03.416 --> 06:06.833
I... I'm bailing out my cousin
and buying a truck.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.708
You and your drug dealer cousin
sell it the next day for cash.

06:09.708 --> 06:10.916
It's money laundering.

06:10.916 --> 06:14.541
Listen, I rode down here
to slap some sense into him. Okay?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.875
The cash is legit.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.958
I sold my car.
I cashed out my stake in a restaurant.

06:19.625 --> 06:22.166
- What restaurant?
- Kan Long Chinese. Percyville.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.375
I know that spot. Decent dim sum.

06:24.375 --> 06:27.708
Okay, so that's where the bag's from.
You can ask 'em.

06:28.791 --> 06:29.708
All right.

06:30.916 --> 06:32.416
We might touch base.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.375
In the meantime, you're going to get
some paperwork in the next 30 days.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.875
My cousin doesn't have 30 days.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.041
- I need to get him out now.
- You need to listen.

06:40.041 --> 06:43.000
You'll get a letter
saying you're being sued for this money

06:43.000 --> 06:44.833
because we believe it's drug money.

06:44.833 --> 06:47.708
If you answer the charges,
and you fight for this money...

06:47.708 --> 06:48.708
This can't be legal.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.625
...then I'll come after you
with a warrant and put you in jail.

06:51.625 --> 06:54.875
Now if you choose not
to answer the civil paperwork,

06:54.875 --> 06:56.333
we win it in default.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.125
You'll never hear from us again.

07:00.666 --> 07:04.708
How about y'all walk me
into Town Hall and we can sort this out?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.166
This is sorted.

07:08.291 --> 07:09.125
Come on.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.958
You're pretty banged up.
You need us to call you an ambulance?

07:13.958 --> 07:15.041
Uh, no.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.500
All right, you're free to go.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.958
Either of you
requesting a jury trial?

08:36.958 --> 08:38.333
No.
No, ma'am.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.541
All right.
Come back Monday morning.

08:40.541 --> 08:42.458
We'll put you up first thing.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.583
I would not wear shorts
in front of the judge.

08:44.583 --> 08:45.583
Yes, ma'am.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.333
All right.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.583
Posting bail or getting married?

08:51.583 --> 08:53.541
Uh, I need somebody
to walk me through this--

08:53.541 --> 08:55.166
You're injured. How'd it happen?

08:55.166 --> 08:57.000
I got rammed off the road.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.791
Oh. Hit-and-run?

08:58.791 --> 08:59.875
All right.

09:00.375 --> 09:03.208
Uh, colleague has a practice
across the street.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.708
Come by after the weekend,

09:05.208 --> 09:08.000
but snap some pics while
you're still bleeding. Get a plate?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.291
Uh, it was the cops.

09:09.291 --> 09:12.458
They took my cash.
All of it. I was on my way here.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.416
That's a seizure notice. I can't help you.

09:14.416 --> 09:17.125
Right. They're transferring
my cousin to state prison?

09:17.125 --> 09:19.708
All our inmates are going.
We're renovating the jail.

09:19.708 --> 09:22.125
Okay, so he can't go. He gotta make bail.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.291
Help me out here.

09:24.291 --> 09:26.291
You've come to post bail

09:27.208 --> 09:28.375
without any money?

09:28.375 --> 09:29.708
You already got it.

09:29.708 --> 09:32.583
This seal is the same as the one
on your office door, so...

09:32.583 --> 09:35.875
Which is the same
as the watermark on my paycheck.

09:35.875 --> 09:39.416
I am a court clerk, not a public defender.

09:39.416 --> 09:42.791
- Is that who I should be talking to?
- Yeah, if we had one.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.000
This is Municipal Court.
We don't try felonies.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.333
Indigent defense is not in our budget,
nor is employee overtime.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.416
Anything else we pick up
during business hours.

09:52.416 --> 09:54.000
This is fucking surreal.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.208
How can I get him out
if they took all my money?

09:59.208 --> 10:01.750
Find some more. Is it a drug charge?

10:02.583 --> 10:03.750
Why would you assume that?

10:03.750 --> 10:05.750
It... It's just a guess.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.250
Elliot. You got to get to a picnic.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.791
- I'll walk him out.
- You sure?

10:09.791 --> 10:11.458
Yup. Say hi to Kate.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.708
Oh, ambrosia...

10:12.708 --> 10:15.000
I had intel there were
already two potato salads.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.541
Gingy and Jeff use eggs and bacon.
You don't want to mess with that. Just go.

10:18.541 --> 10:20.958
- Thank you. Enjoy the weekend.
- You bet.

10:22.708 --> 10:23.833
I'm Summer.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.875
Terry.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.041
So you sure they took all your money?

10:29.666 --> 10:31.333
I mean, I got what's in my wallet.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.500
- Thanks, Cindy.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.708
- It's called civil asset forfeiture.
And it's legal?

10:37.708 --> 10:39.291
Well, it's a law.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.916
Supposed to help Feds fight cartels.

10:41.916 --> 10:44.125
But they didn't find any drugs, so...

10:44.125 --> 10:45.541
All they need is suspicion.

10:45.541 --> 10:48.041
'Cause the seizure isn't tied
to any criminal charges.

10:48.041 --> 10:50.875
And, here's where it gets real murky,

10:50.875 --> 10:54.458
Chief gets to keep the proceeds,
use it for "discretionary funds."

10:54.458 --> 10:55.833
Whatever that means.

10:56.333 --> 11:00.416
Someone in permits told me he bought a
$900 margarita machine for Cinco de Mayo.

11:00.416 --> 11:04.041
Right, so never mind the, uh...
Shit. Which amendment is due process?

11:04.041 --> 11:07.041
Doesn't matter. It's the fifth and 14th.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.875
But, when they bring this case,
you won't even be named.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.875
It's literally going to read...

11:12.875 --> 11:15.291
- How much money was it again?
- 36k.

11:15.291 --> 11:19.625
It'll read <i>The Township of Shelby Springs
v $36,000.</i>

11:19.625 --> 11:22.875
Because your property has no civil rights.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.833
But you can help me get it back?

11:25.583 --> 11:26.500
No.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.875
Okay. Thank you.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.458
I mean, yes, you can fight for the money,

11:35.458 --> 11:38.875
but that'll take you most of a year,
and cost you twice what you're owed.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.958
What I can do is, um...

11:47.500 --> 11:48.583
Okay...

11:49.625 --> 11:50.500
Let's go.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.000
Can't talk smack.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.541
Chief has more allies than he used to.

11:59.541 --> 12:02.416
Lost a pretty nasty civil suit
couple years back.

12:02.416 --> 12:03.833
Had to clean up his act.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.875
He didn't do so bad a job either.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.500
Okay, his name?

12:09.333 --> 12:10.875
Michael Simmons. Mike.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.708
And what's he in for?

12:13.708 --> 12:15.250
Misdemeanor possession.

12:15.791 --> 12:19.166
- So Elliot was right back there?
- Yeah, but fuck him.

12:20.583 --> 12:23.375
I will say bail's set really high
for that charge.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.541
He had priors?

12:24.541 --> 12:27.958
No. I mean, yeah, but they're expunged.

12:28.791 --> 12:32.375
He's had a good run. But before,
out east, got into some deep shit.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.583
Ended up a cooperating witness
on a capital murder charge.

12:35.583 --> 12:38.000
Dude he helped put away
was high up in a gang, so...

12:38.583 --> 12:41.125
Okay, and if Mike ends up
in a state facility--

12:41.125 --> 12:43.500
Yeah, they spot him? He'll get swarmed.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.250
- Yikes.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.083
- And the transfer's Thursday, yes?
- Yeah.

12:49.083 --> 12:52.291
Okay, so you got some time.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.291
- Can you get more money?
- I think so.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.916
- Gotta make a call.
- Okay. Good.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.041
You know a lot.

13:02.166 --> 13:05.125
- You a lawyer or...
- Eighteen credits shy of a J.D.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.500
Then the bar. So not for a while.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.541
Cool. So why are you helping me?

13:09.541 --> 13:11.958
Well, it's pretty clear
you need it.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.083
And I know what that's like.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.666
That's family. So...

13:20.625 --> 13:21.583
I appreciate it.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.208
- I appreciate your appreciation.

13:25.875 --> 13:26.916
Got a number?

13:26.916 --> 13:28.833
In case I turn something up?

13:28.833 --> 13:30.833
Yeah, but I don't really give it out.

13:31.333 --> 13:32.416
I'll check back.

13:33.666 --> 13:34.500
Okay.

13:35.791 --> 13:36.833
All right.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.875
<i>Kan Long Chinese, please hold.</i>
- No, it's Terry.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.708
Can you put me through to Mr. Liu?

13:49.708 --> 13:51.416
<i>Oh. What up, T?</i>

13:51.416 --> 13:53.125
- What's up?
<i>Hang on a sec.</i>

13:56.583 --> 13:59.875
<i>Terry, you already want back
in the restaurant business?</i>

13:59.875 --> 14:02.041
Never should have left, sir.

14:03.291 --> 14:04.333
<i>Everything okay?</i>

14:04.333 --> 14:06.541
No, sir. Uh, hit a snag.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.916
Might need a wire to tide me over.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.416
<i>Yeah. How much?</i>

14:11.416 --> 14:12.458
Ten thousand.

14:13.541 --> 14:14.500
<i>When?</i>

14:15.583 --> 14:18.250
Early as Monday.
Wednesday would be cutting it close.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.833
<i>That's going to be rough.</i>

14:21.875 --> 14:23.500
<i>There's a Western Union?</i>

14:24.125 --> 14:25.583
Uh, just a post office.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.833
<i>So, uh, money orders,</i>

14:28.333 --> 14:30.125
<i>they're capped at a grand.</i>

14:30.125 --> 14:31.416
<i>So you need ten.</i>

14:32.041 --> 14:34.583
- Yeah, I hate asking.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.583
<i>All right.</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:40.125
<i>Text Ken the zip, any receiving details,
and we can be ready on our end.</i>

14:40.708 --> 14:42.625
<i>You need it, just call.</i>

14:42.625 --> 14:44.000
Okay, will do.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.166
Thank you, sir.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.250
<i>You're welcome.</i>

16:03.583 --> 16:04.666
Morning, ma'am.

16:04.666 --> 16:06.333
Hey there, how can I help you?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.083
I need to report a crime.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.125
Oh, good goodness.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.666
And this was cash?

16:13.666 --> 16:15.250
Yes, ma'am. Uh, do you mind?

16:15.250 --> 16:16.291
Oh, that's fine.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.041
I ran out of juice. Thank you.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.083
Hey, Chief.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.291
Mornin', Jess.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.291
Okay. Can you describe the suspect?

16:27.791 --> 16:29.541
Uh, big guy.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.791
White, blue eyes, about 6'4".

16:33.791 --> 16:36.166
Must weigh 250, easy.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.000
- You got a good memory.
Thank you.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.208
Um, I didn't get his badge number,
but his last name's Marston,

16:42.208 --> 16:43.666
first initial "E."

16:44.458 --> 16:47.375
Uh... And there goes suspect number two.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.291
Pardon me. Just a minute.

16:53.291 --> 16:54.416
Yes, ma'am.

17:05.666 --> 17:06.958
I'll take care of it.

17:13.583 --> 17:14.625
Sir?

17:16.833 --> 17:18.333
You're gonna need to leave.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.458
I'd like to finish up.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.458
A false police report?

17:22.125 --> 17:24.250
Put your signature on that,

17:24.833 --> 17:26.000
it's a felony.

17:26.916 --> 17:27.750
Cool.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.333
What's the charge
for being rammed off the road,

17:30.333 --> 17:32.125
shit stolen, threatened with a Taser?

17:32.125 --> 17:34.458
- Get up.
- While I was in cuffs, by the way.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.875
We can pick this up
right where we left off.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.375
Now, now, now, now.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.000
We don't need none of that.

17:43.083 --> 17:46.041
- Mr., uh, Richmond?
- Yes, sir.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.083
I was briefed on this matter yesterday

17:48.083 --> 17:51.333
and whatever your concerns might be,

17:51.333 --> 17:55.333
there is no doubt in my mind that you
were the subject of a legal interdiction.

17:55.333 --> 18:00.250
Fled an officer of the law,
evaded arrest, suspicion of conspiracy.

18:01.708 --> 18:04.625
You've been treated
with more than due respect.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.500
But right now you're facing felony charges
if you persist in harassing my officers.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.875
- Your officers--
- Allow me to finish!

18:15.208 --> 18:19.333
Now you sustained minor injuries
after colliding with a patrol vehicle,

18:19.333 --> 18:23.416
and you were offered, but refused,
medical assistance at the scene.

18:23.416 --> 18:26.833
Seems like any harm that's come to you
is of your own doing.

18:27.333 --> 18:31.625
Now, currently, and under false pretenses,
you are in a secure area.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.708
So I'm going to ask you
if you'd be so kind

18:33.708 --> 18:36.666
as to cut off your recording device,

18:36.666 --> 18:38.250
and exit my station.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.208
You betcha.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.916
- May I at least see my cousin?
- You can fuck right off.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.791
I would love to, sir.
Just as soon as I get my money back.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.500
Did they even include my statement?

18:56.500 --> 19:00.500
I can fully account for the money,
where it was from, and what it was for.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.416
The dim sum spot? We made a note.

19:02.416 --> 19:05.458
- You said you'd check it out. Did they?
Listen up, son.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.083
We are not litigating this here.

19:08.083 --> 19:11.041
You got every right to fight
that forfeiture in court,

19:11.041 --> 19:12.291
but until then,

19:13.416 --> 19:14.833
like I said.

19:24.291 --> 19:25.791
What if I didn't fight it?

19:25.791 --> 19:30.083
What if all I wanted was the ten for bail?
You keep 26k, and I disappear.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.458
I just need him out.

19:45.666 --> 19:48.166
You mind making
a Xerox of this for me, Jess?

19:48.166 --> 19:49.291
Yes, sir.

19:49.791 --> 19:50.875
Yep.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.458
We don't have one here, but there's a form

19:57.458 --> 20:00.458
that you can sign
to disclaim that currency.

20:02.916 --> 20:05.833
That bus Corrections or are we chartering?

20:05.833 --> 20:07.916
- Chartering it from Corrections.
- Comes when?

20:07.916 --> 20:09.791
Thursday. We break ground Friday.

20:11.416 --> 20:12.458
All right.

20:13.708 --> 20:14.875
We'll follow up on this.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.666
Don't exactly have
visiting hours around here.

20:17.666 --> 20:20.958
But if you come back here
at 9:00 a.m. on Monday morning,

20:21.750 --> 20:23.458
you can see your cousin,

20:24.166 --> 20:25.416
and we'll put this to bed.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.708
Thank you.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.041
Now fuck off.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.000
Thank you.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.041
Yes, sir.

22:20.291 --> 22:22.000
Shit, you just missed 'em.

22:22.625 --> 22:23.916
Who? What do you mean?

22:25.375 --> 22:26.708
We pulled up our schedule.

22:27.708 --> 22:28.791
Hold on.

22:29.541 --> 22:32.041
- You said I could see him.
- At 9:00 a.m.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.375
You're three minutes late.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.125
Hey, yo!

23:23.166 --> 23:24.333
Yo, Mike!

23:25.541 --> 23:27.458
- Hey, Mike!

23:28.000 --> 23:29.166
Yo!

23:32.166 --> 23:33.583
- Yo!
- Terry?

23:33.583 --> 23:35.458
Hey, Mike!
Terry!

23:35.458 --> 23:37.625
Mike!
- Fuck is you doing, man?

23:37.625 --> 23:39.375
I'm gettin' you out!

23:39.375 --> 23:41.416
- Nigga, this a jailbreak?
- I'm posting bail!

23:41.416 --> 23:43.375
You gotta request protective custody--

23:43.375 --> 23:46.208
- Don't sweat it. They reduced my charge.
- As soon as you process!

23:46.208 --> 23:49.166
- Told me I'd be in and out.
- I'm serious. They'll know who you are!

23:50.416 --> 23:51.541
How bad I fuck up?

23:51.541 --> 23:53.041
Just stay low! All right?

23:54.291 --> 23:55.666
- All right.
- All right!

23:56.333 --> 23:57.416
Oh, shit.

23:57.416 --> 23:58.958
Next time, cuz!

24:00.250 --> 24:03.708
Come on, T! Come on!

24:03.708 --> 24:04.750
Yeah!

24:05.375 --> 24:08.458
Oh, shit! Come on, T! Come on!

24:15.833 --> 24:17.000
Come on!

24:17.583 --> 24:18.625
Yeah!

24:22.750 --> 24:24.500
- Mike!
Come on, T!

24:24.500 --> 24:26.250
- Yeah!

24:26.250 --> 24:28.625
Got that cardio, son!

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
That's my cousin! Yeah!

24:45.625 --> 24:47.791
<i>Hello?</i>
- You dropped the accent?

24:48.625 --> 24:49.708
<i>Not open.</i>

24:49.708 --> 24:53.500
What, no more 24/7? Look, I'm gonna
need those money orders ASAP.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.416
Just texted you the receiving info.

24:55.416 --> 24:57.583
<i>Sir, those aren't mine.</i>

24:59.458 --> 25:01.750
<i>- Yeah, let me put you through.</i>
- But Mr. Liu already--

25:07.083 --> 25:09.916
<i>What the hell, Terry?</i>
- Sir, uh, things fell through.

25:09.916 --> 25:11.958
I'mma need to pull the trigger
on that 10K.

25:11.958 --> 25:13.458
<i>It's off the table.</i>

25:13.458 --> 25:15.583
It's urgent.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it.

25:15.583 --> 25:18.833
<i>I got half a dozen cops here
executing a search warrant.</i>

25:18.833 --> 25:22.291
<i>Took my safe. Got dogs sniffing for drugs.</i>

25:22.791 --> 25:24.875
- Wait, how?

25:24.875 --> 25:28.375
<i>You implicated my business
in a statement to the Shelby Springs PD.</i>

25:28.375 --> 25:31.083
<i>They contacted Percyville,
Percyville came knocking.</i>

25:31.083 --> 25:34.375
I didn't implicate you. I was accounting
for the money in my possession.

25:34.375 --> 25:37.083
- I couldn't have been more clear.

25:37.083 --> 25:40.125
<i>I don't doubt that,
but you didn't draft the warrant,</i>

25:40.125 --> 25:41.500
<i>and I'm gonna miss payroll.</i>

25:41.500 --> 25:43.125
I'll make this right, sir.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.125
<i>Okay. Sure.</i>

25:51.583 --> 25:52.750
Fuck.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.875
- Wouldn't drink the public water.
<i>- </i>  Hey, were you--

26:03.875 --> 26:07.041
Lemme know when you've filled these out,
and I'll walk you over.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.291
You. You're still wearing shorts.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.541
It's all I rock.

26:11.166 --> 26:12.166
Godspeed.

26:13.916 --> 26:14.791
I'm working.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.916
I'm sorry.
These cops, they're fucking with me.

26:16.916 --> 26:18.750
Yeah. They're saying the same about you.

26:18.750 --> 26:20.250
They're transferring him.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.000
He's on a bus right now.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.208
- Sorry to hear that.
- You said you could help.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.250
You found something?

26:29.125 --> 26:31.375
I poked around. Got poked back.

26:31.375 --> 26:34.625
- So, is there anything--
- Look, I need this job, Terry.

26:35.166 --> 26:36.041
You gotta go.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.375
I'd use the back door.

26:42.458 --> 26:43.458
Okay.

26:52.625 --> 26:53.541
Fuck!

27:06.166 --> 27:08.000
Oh, hey, Terry!

27:08.000 --> 27:11.916
Sorry, there's too many lurkers. Judge
walked in on me going over Mike's file.

27:11.916 --> 27:14.500
- You all right?
- Yeah, thanks. He's fine.

27:14.500 --> 27:18.250
But I flagged a bunch more cases
with super high bail.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.833
- Every one had an adjournment.
- What does that mean?

27:20.833 --> 27:24.041
Not sure. I got busted.
But something's up.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.041
Something's off.

27:25.041 --> 27:27.291
Misdemeanor defendants
don't sit in jail that long.

27:27.291 --> 27:30.333
- Why is that?
- It's expensive. This town's broke.

27:30.333 --> 27:32.291
Okay, so how do we pursue this?

27:33.083 --> 27:35.500
Look, I sent what I could
to an old inkjet.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.291
I'll grab you the print-outs after work,
but that's it.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.125
I wasn't playing about my job.

27:41.750 --> 27:42.958
I got a little girl.

27:43.916 --> 27:45.958
Okay. But this could get Mike out?

27:46.708 --> 27:48.791
If it's a big deal. Maybe.

27:48.791 --> 27:53.000
- But if your timeframe's a day? No chance.
- My timeframe's an hour.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.666
What about the money?
You said you could get more money.

27:55.666 --> 27:57.250
- That's gone.
- Shoot!

27:57.250 --> 27:58.333
Summer?

28:01.416 --> 28:03.250
Hey, listen, what gets Mike out?

28:03.250 --> 28:05.958
Uh, besides bail, a court order.

28:05.958 --> 28:08.750
- But the judge won't sign one.
Summer, what're you doing?

28:08.750 --> 28:11.125
So my only hope
is dropping 10K on your desk?

28:11.125 --> 28:13.166
His desk. Yeah.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.375
Just catching a smoke!
I'll be right there!

28:15.375 --> 28:18.083
Uh, you don't smoke.
- I'm vaping!

28:18.083 --> 28:19.833
- What time you take lunch?
- What?

28:19.833 --> 28:21.833
I don't wanna walk in
with a pile of money,

28:21.833 --> 28:23.541
and you be out getting a sandwich.

28:23.541 --> 28:25.875
I'll have the paperwork ready. Okay?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.416
What're you gonna do?

28:29.416 --> 28:31.833
Let's go. We're piling up.

28:31.833 --> 28:33.083
I'll see ya.

28:53.625 --> 28:56.583
Chief, you've got an incoming.

28:59.166 --> 29:00.750
That's your DD214.

29:01.750 --> 29:05.958
- What are we looking at?
-"Richmond, Terrence James, USMC."

29:05.958 --> 29:07.833
"Paygrade E-4, Camp Lejeune."

29:07.833 --> 29:12.916
Here we go.
"Primary specialty M-C-M-A-P instructor."

29:12.916 --> 29:14.541
- What's that?
- McMap...

29:14.541 --> 29:16.291
Maybe he's a navigator?

29:16.875 --> 29:20.208
McMap... Why don't you google that, Jess?

29:21.500 --> 29:23.000
Rifle expert badge.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.583
Ah, they all get that one.

29:25.291 --> 29:26.875
What was it again? "M-C..."

29:26.875 --> 29:28.000
"M-A-P."

29:30.500 --> 29:32.083
Let me restart this Wi-Fi.

29:34.666 --> 29:35.958
There's not much else.

29:35.958 --> 29:39.208
"Released from active duty in '17."

29:39.791 --> 29:42.250
Some shit about his dental work.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.625
"Character of service, honorable."

29:46.083 --> 29:47.666
Chief, he's here.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.666
Who's that?
Robby or the concrete guy?

29:51.333 --> 29:53.583
Terry Richmond. He's out front.

29:55.333 --> 29:56.166
Steve?

30:01.166 --> 30:06.708
"Was on active duty during Iraq,
but did not himself serve overseas."

30:06.708 --> 30:08.416
"Never deployed."

30:08.416 --> 30:09.750
So, no combat experience.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.458
- None. It would say.
Good.

30:13.541 --> 30:15.583
My heart damn near skipped a beat.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.750
How you want to handle this?

30:21.750 --> 30:24.333
Aw, why don't you
let me run him off?

30:24.333 --> 30:25.375
You hang back.

30:25.375 --> 30:26.666
Got you, Chief.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.083
Robby, why don't you
go ahead and call lunch.

30:39.583 --> 30:42.208
It's early. Maybe we--
- Yeah, Robby.

30:42.750 --> 30:45.000
- Just go ahead and call lunch.
All right.

30:45.625 --> 30:48.291
- Break! Hey, boys, that's lunch!

30:48.291 --> 30:49.250
Chief.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.541
I'm glad you're back.

30:53.083 --> 30:55.333
You left before
you could see my shit-eatin' grin.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.583
Oh. Lay it on me.

30:57.583 --> 30:59.875
Aw, it's not the same if you ask.

31:00.541 --> 31:02.333
Man, I thought we had a deal.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.458
Well, that was the point.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.000
Of what?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.250
Misleading you.

31:09.875 --> 31:10.750
I see.

31:10.750 --> 31:11.708
Do you?

31:13.166 --> 31:15.708
Because the offer you made
wasn't unreasonable.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.333
It was more than fair,
as far as the trouble it would save.

31:19.333 --> 31:20.833
Well, it still stands.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.708
So you don't see.

31:24.291 --> 31:25.833
It wasn't the offer you made.

31:25.833 --> 31:28.875
It was the fact that you thought
you were entitled to make one.

31:30.125 --> 31:33.958
- Well, my intentions weren't to offend--
- Straight to hell with your intentions.

31:34.458 --> 31:38.708
You do not stand in my station
in front of my officers and set terms.

31:38.708 --> 31:41.166
I wasn't aware it was a pissing contest.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.916
Come on now. Hm.

31:43.750 --> 31:44.875
Isn't it always?

31:44.875 --> 31:46.666
So whatever I say, my cousin--

31:46.666 --> 31:50.291
You could offer me eternal life
or a catfish sandwich,

31:50.291 --> 31:52.791
and the answer would still be the same.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.375
Especially since you
stopped calling me "sir,"

31:55.375 --> 31:57.583
which is the only thing
you had going for you.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.666
Well, see, that's a courtesy
I extend only so far.

32:01.166 --> 32:03.166
One of the perks of civilian life.

32:06.500 --> 32:09.250
Let's not go reminiscing
about the Corps now.

32:09.916 --> 32:12.583
- We both know you never left the base.
- Checking up on me.

32:12.583 --> 32:13.958
What were you, motor-pool?

32:13.958 --> 32:17.583
No, put in for infantry, but, uh,
they found a use for me state-side.

32:17.583 --> 32:19.875
- Now good for them.

32:19.875 --> 32:21.541
I've had no such luck.

32:22.791 --> 32:24.875
So I guess it's time you headed on,

32:24.875 --> 32:27.458
and be grateful
because if I still had a jail...

32:27.958 --> 32:29.875
...you'd already be in it.

32:29.875 --> 32:33.541
I mean, you got me
in a tight enough spot as is.

32:33.541 --> 32:34.750
Both of us, actually.

32:35.375 --> 32:36.458
How's that?

32:36.458 --> 32:38.375
Well...

32:38.375 --> 32:39.833
That's why I'm here.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.791
I'm running out of letters.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.708
See, it's, and I don't mean to reminisce,

32:46.708 --> 32:50.083
but, uh, one thing
I can't shake from the Corps,

32:50.916 --> 32:51.958
acronyms.

32:52.708 --> 32:55.208
Man, we got tons
that seared into my brain.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.500
- I got an acronym for ya.
- Allow me to finish.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.083
That Wi-Fi up yet?

33:02.083 --> 33:03.458
- It's coming.

33:06.083 --> 33:09.708
The acronym you need
to worry about right now is PACE.

33:10.208 --> 33:12.916
P-A-C-E. Ever heard of it?

33:13.500 --> 33:15.958
It's a planning methodology
used for comm systems,

33:15.958 --> 33:18.541
but they found
it could be applied anywhere.

33:18.541 --> 33:22.541
Nursing, engineering,
parachute infiltrations,

33:23.125 --> 33:24.333
posting bail.

33:25.166 --> 33:26.916
So the P is for "primary,"

33:27.416 --> 33:30.500
that's me riding into town
with my bag of money.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.750
A is for "alternate."

33:33.750 --> 33:36.041
That's the deal we apparently never made.

33:37.083 --> 33:39.083
C is my "contingency."

33:39.583 --> 33:43.208
That's the restaurant owner
you put out of business this morning.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.291
And there it is!

33:47.125 --> 33:50.250
Spot-on too, like you just ate shit.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.250
Anyway, you got me burning through
all these letters.

33:54.916 --> 33:58.625
And after this conversation,
we already on E.

33:59.666 --> 34:01.166
You know what that stands for?

34:01.166 --> 34:03.291
"Marine Corps
Martial Arts Program."

34:03.291 --> 34:05.625
- What?
-"MCMAP."

34:05.625 --> 34:09.250
"Combat system combines hand-to-hand,
close quarters..."

34:09.250 --> 34:11.583
- Oh-oh.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.916
I think he's on the Wikipedia page,

34:13.916 --> 34:17.166
teaching jiu-jitsu
to the 6th Marine Regiment.

34:17.166 --> 34:18.250
Okay.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.500
"Team building..."

34:20.291 --> 34:22.041
"One mind. Any weapon."

34:22.041 --> 34:24.291
- Call in any units on patrol.
Yup.

34:25.291 --> 34:27.041
- Here come your peeps.
Chief!

34:27.041 --> 34:29.500
You wanna honor that deal
or do I gotta transition to E?

34:29.500 --> 34:31.458
Put some distance between you!

34:37.500 --> 34:39.000
Ah. Let's not do that.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.375
Hey! Hey! Hey!

34:44.958 --> 34:45.916
Let go! Move back!

34:45.916 --> 34:48.750
- Okay, okay. Don't shoot.
- Move the fuck away from him!

34:48.750 --> 34:50.541
All right. Okay! Okay. Okay.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.666
Hey!

35:14.666 --> 35:17.333
Okay. Real quick.
We're gonna stay cool and go inside.

35:17.333 --> 35:20.333
- You're fuckin' nuts!
- Lead the way. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

35:20.958 --> 35:23.541
Go! Tell them to safety their rifle.

35:24.166 --> 35:25.125
Why would I?

35:25.125 --> 35:28.333
He's quiet with good form. If anyone's
gettin' anyone killed, it's him.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.083
As long as I'm not the one dying.

35:30.083 --> 35:32.208
I'm scared of him shooting me, Chief.

35:32.208 --> 35:35.208
I'm not waiting on him to go first,
and you're between us.

35:35.208 --> 35:38.000
All right! Go ahead
and point that thing the other way!

35:38.500 --> 35:41.125
- Go on now! It's just a dust-up!
Safety that weapon!

35:41.125 --> 35:43.833
- Open the door.
We'll handle it! We got it!

35:48.666 --> 35:50.916
Move.

35:54.958 --> 35:56.916
All right, center of the room.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.208
Sit down.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.083
Sit down or I sit you down.

36:25.666 --> 36:28.125
All right, where is she?

36:29.375 --> 36:32.375
We're the only ones here. Skeleton shift.

36:32.375 --> 36:33.333
Bullshit.

36:33.875 --> 36:36.208
Sims is here. You got two on patrol.

36:38.416 --> 36:42.041
All right, if this goes fast,
it'll go as well as it can.

36:42.041 --> 36:46.041
But if you slow me down...
it's gonna suck for everybody.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.000
Jess, come on out!

36:52.125 --> 36:53.708
Come on out, Jess!

36:54.416 --> 36:56.208
Let's just get this over with.

37:01.583 --> 37:02.583
Sorry, Chief.

37:02.583 --> 37:04.416
Don't you apologize.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.666
All right, weapon on the deck.

37:09.833 --> 37:10.708
Let's go.

37:15.791 --> 37:17.333
All right, restrain them.

37:18.333 --> 37:19.916
Their cuffs, not yours.

37:27.791 --> 37:30.000
I'm assuming
my money's in the property room.

37:36.791 --> 37:37.958
You got keys?

37:39.541 --> 37:40.666
Right hip.

37:42.125 --> 37:43.083
Go.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.375
Stop.

37:53.083 --> 37:54.000
Go.

38:04.916 --> 38:05.791
Yeah.

38:05.791 --> 38:07.708
Hey, just make sure it's my...

38:08.916 --> 38:10.333
Goddamn.

38:18.416 --> 38:19.375
Count out 10K.

38:22.625 --> 38:23.625
Deal's a deal.

38:25.833 --> 38:27.458
Feel free to round up though.

38:30.708 --> 38:31.791
Okay.

38:32.625 --> 38:33.833
Go ahead.

38:38.500 --> 38:39.500
Stop there.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.333
Is there a back exit?

38:42.333 --> 38:44.958
Side one to the lot,
but you still gotta exit out front.

38:44.958 --> 38:48.291
I'm holding on to your weapon.
I'll surrender it to Sims once I'm safe.

38:48.291 --> 38:50.166
You ain't ever gonna be safe.

38:52.666 --> 38:56.958
Now, I'm assuming those boys out there
are forming a redneck SWAT team.

38:56.958 --> 38:59.375
Can you and I agree
we both want to avoid gunfire?

38:59.375 --> 39:01.375
- Of course.

39:11.666 --> 39:13.333
Their lives are in your hands.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.833
Now your cuffs.

39:24.166 --> 39:26.625
It's all over now.

39:27.791 --> 39:30.291
- Chief says back to work.
Where is he?

39:30.291 --> 39:32.833
On QuickBooks setting up your payroll.

39:32.833 --> 39:33.833
Go on.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.958
Someone should string
that motherfucker up!

39:48.000 --> 39:49.208
Don't get ignorant.

39:49.208 --> 39:51.791
This man is a veteran
going through something difficult.

39:51.791 --> 39:53.958
We had a misunderstanding, but it's over.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.916
Now you go on about your business,
and let us go about ours.

39:57.416 --> 39:58.291
Hey.

39:58.875 --> 39:59.958
Thanks for that.

39:59.958 --> 40:02.083
It was for me. Not you.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.166
Disable the perp locks, please.

40:13.166 --> 40:14.750
Not my cruiser.

40:14.750 --> 40:16.500
I can pull over, figure it out.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.208
Just keep going.
I'll shoot the glass out if I have to.

40:22.291 --> 40:24.541
I see they got you rolling
in an old-ass Crown Vic

40:24.541 --> 40:26.833
while they get brand-new
Chargers for themselves.

40:26.833 --> 40:29.708
Chief says we need a diversified fleet,
in case of a recall.

40:31.250 --> 40:34.500
- And I like my Crown Vic.
- Hey, you stay cool, I'll stay cool.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.708
What's that? What's that mean?

40:43.708 --> 40:45.333
Code 4.

40:45.333 --> 40:48.083
I'm okay. You're okay.

40:48.083 --> 40:50.541
<i>Go ahead, 105, just passed you.</i>

40:50.541 --> 40:53.333
- Code 13--
- No 10 codes. Speak so I can follow.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.250
Be advised.
Officers need assistance at the station.

40:58.250 --> 41:02.625
Suspect has left the scene. Now on foot,
headed northbound on 13 at Mount Ida.

41:02.625 --> 41:03.958
Suspect is...

41:04.875 --> 41:08.500
- I said I'd surrender it. Keep going.
- I'm not telling my officers until I know.

41:18.541 --> 41:22.000
Unarmed... but considered dangerous.

41:24.875 --> 41:28.875
<i>We need all units on
that search. Gets pretty thick out there.</i>

41:28.875 --> 41:29.958
<i>Copy, 106.</i>

41:30.833 --> 41:33.083
I'll drop them on the paint
a mile up the road.

41:33.625 --> 41:34.625
<i>Copy.</i>

41:34.625 --> 41:35.708
Sorry.

41:39.416 --> 41:40.958
<i>105. Come in.</i>

41:43.000 --> 41:44.666
<i>105. Do you copy?</i>

42:12.916 --> 42:13.916
You good?

42:17.791 --> 42:19.125
I'm good.

42:30.666 --> 42:31.541
Good.

42:37.166 --> 42:39.416
- Good afternoon.
<i>- </i>  Posting bail or getting married?

42:39.416 --> 42:41.666
Defendant is Simmons, Michael R.

42:44.083 --> 42:47.166
You want to count it out, Elliot?
I'll get the judge to sign.

42:47.166 --> 42:48.500
All right.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.833
Need you to sign
this bail form right here.

43:07.833 --> 43:09.375
Bail form.

43:13.083 --> 43:14.708
I double-checked. Yes, sir.

43:18.250 --> 43:19.958
Um, how was your weekend?

43:19.958 --> 43:21.666
- You're over.
- Hm?

43:21.666 --> 43:22.708
This is yours.

43:23.541 --> 43:25.000
I'll get you a receipt.

43:25.583 --> 43:28.750
Refund if he shows for his hearing.
He'll owe a levy for court costs.

43:28.750 --> 43:30.000
Not a problem.

43:30.666 --> 43:32.500
Oops! Wrong one.

43:35.791 --> 43:37.250
Summer, are these yours?

43:37.250 --> 43:40.708
Oh, yeah. I was just, uh,
going over a few cases.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.166
Shouldn't leave these out.

43:42.166 --> 43:44.000
Let me just shoot this over.

43:48.541 --> 43:49.750
Did it go through?

43:50.250 --> 43:51.958
On our end, yeah.

43:52.625 --> 43:55.083
- Did you hurt someone?
- Barely broke the skin.

43:55.875 --> 43:57.291
Think he'll get out?

43:59.666 --> 44:03.083
- Think they'll send me to where he's at?
- Was that your plan?

44:04.916 --> 44:08.375
- I ran out of plan.
On the floor! Now! Move!

44:09.458 --> 44:12.125
Down on the ground!
Slow! Hands!

44:12.125 --> 44:13.916
- Knees!
- On the ground!

44:13.916 --> 44:15.041
Get those hands up!

44:15.041 --> 44:16.291
Here we fucking go!

44:16.291 --> 44:17.875
- Don't! Oh my God!
Taser!

44:17.875 --> 44:20.416
- Tell the chief I said--
On the floor!

44:20.416 --> 44:22.000
- Oh, my Lord!
Get back!

44:23.583 --> 44:25.666
Get down!

44:28.291 --> 44:30.125
Stop!

44:30.125 --> 44:31.083
Gimme your hand!

44:31.083 --> 44:32.250
Don't hurt him!

44:32.250 --> 44:34.500
Get his arms.
Gimme your hand!

44:34.500 --> 44:36.916
Hands! Gimme your hands!

44:36.916 --> 44:39.333
All right, take it easy!
Stay down!

44:39.333 --> 44:40.416
Stop moving.

44:40.416 --> 44:42.333
- Stop fucking moving!
Take it easy!

44:43.791 --> 44:45.541
Cuff him!
- A deal's a deal.

44:46.375 --> 44:48.708
I'll call medical.
Yeah...

44:48.708 --> 44:50.625
- He stays put.
Holding's full.

44:50.625 --> 44:52.541
Put him in the catacombs.

44:56.875 --> 44:57.916
Open.

45:04.666 --> 45:05.500
Reactive.

45:06.958 --> 45:08.125
So he's good?

45:08.625 --> 45:12.166
Probes were out when we got here.
No real tissue damage.

45:12.166 --> 45:15.208
ECG was good. No cardiac history.

45:16.208 --> 45:19.083
You ingest any drugs today?
Meth, anything like that?

45:19.083 --> 45:20.166
Mm-mm.

45:20.166 --> 45:22.708
- When was your last tetanus shot?
- I don't know.

45:23.208 --> 45:24.458
You should get one.

45:27.500 --> 45:28.458
He's good.

45:28.958 --> 45:30.833
More worried about the mold in here.

45:31.458 --> 45:34.416
- This was a jail?
It's a catacombs. Storage now.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.458
You up for a drive?

45:41.166 --> 45:43.083
Don't I need to get in front of a judge?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.083
Someone else wants to see you first.

46:07.375 --> 46:08.833
Do yourself a favor.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Hear him out.

46:32.125 --> 46:34.250
They confirm which one?
Yup.

46:41.833 --> 46:44.250
You know the thing
about a pissing contest?

46:45.291 --> 46:47.708
Everybody gets piss on their boots.

46:49.125 --> 46:50.500
Do you agree with that?

46:51.208 --> 46:52.083
Sure.

46:55.083 --> 46:56.958
Today should have never happened.

46:57.833 --> 47:00.833
If I'd known who you were,
maybe it wouldn't have.

47:00.833 --> 47:02.750
May I ask where we're going?

47:02.750 --> 47:04.666
Give me a minute here. Okay?

47:05.375 --> 47:06.333
Okay.

47:07.375 --> 47:11.291
When you came in today and
gave yourself the tour, what'd you see?

47:13.541 --> 47:17.166
- Not sure how I'm supposed to answer that.
You can be frank.

47:18.333 --> 47:21.875
I saw a shit ton of cash, and enough
weaponry to support a rifle platoon.

47:21.875 --> 47:26.791
That cash is our operating budget
for the next two quarters, if that.

47:27.625 --> 47:31.208
All of it legally seized,
all of it going back into the community.

47:31.208 --> 47:33.166
Like the margarita machine?

47:35.708 --> 47:38.333
Heard about that, did you?

47:40.375 --> 47:41.333
Well,

47:42.541 --> 47:46.666
sometimes we... we all need
a little something for the morale.

47:48.375 --> 47:51.375
What you saw in that cage
was our survival.

47:53.083 --> 47:56.416
Out of six towns, we're the last
in the parish with our own force.

47:56.416 --> 47:59.833
Got us doing traffic control,
responding to medical.

47:59.833 --> 48:03.708
Evan here took, I don't know how many...
How many reports you take last year?

48:03.708 --> 48:06.208
- Close to 600.
Six hundred.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.833
And they cut our budget.

48:07.833 --> 48:10.625
Say they're going to issue bonds,
but they never do.

48:10.625 --> 48:14.000
Crawl up our ass for police reform,
but they won't fund it.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.125
Not only do we got to find our own money,
we got to turn a profit.

48:18.958 --> 48:19.791
Those weapons...

48:21.083 --> 48:22.791
Did you get a good look at 'em?

48:24.000 --> 48:28.458
The multi-launcher and the flashbangs...
You ever heard of a dazzler?

48:28.458 --> 48:29.375
Non-lethal.

48:29.375 --> 48:33.083
Yeah, we have to call 'em
"less-lethal." Liability purposes.

48:34.541 --> 48:38.000
But yeah, we, uh,
outsource them to the other PDs.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.875
Protests, riots, suicide by cop.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.625
Civil unrest,
it's a growth industry around here.

48:44.625 --> 48:48.166
- I don't know about the Marines.
- Yeah. We got an acronym for it.

48:48.916 --> 48:50.000
Well, what is it?

48:50.791 --> 48:52.750
E-O-F, N-L-E.

48:53.583 --> 48:56.000
Escalation of Force, Non-Lethal Effects.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.541
That's the new thing.

48:57.541 --> 48:59.250
De-escalation.

49:00.041 --> 49:03.416
Save the perps from themselves.
Everybody lives to fight another day.

49:05.666 --> 49:07.041
Well, I'm all for it.

49:07.708 --> 49:08.666
How about you?

49:08.666 --> 49:10.125
For what?

49:11.083 --> 49:12.250
De-escalation.

49:17.250 --> 49:18.500
Sure.

49:23.333 --> 49:24.458
Come on out.

49:25.541 --> 49:26.666
Nice and slow.

49:28.916 --> 49:30.333
All right, turn around.

49:35.083 --> 49:36.625
26,000.

49:36.625 --> 49:37.791
Still in there.

49:38.291 --> 49:39.458
What is this?

49:40.666 --> 49:43.208
- What's happening?
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

49:43.208 --> 49:47.166
But first, we're gonna have to
take those cuffs off of you

49:47.166 --> 49:50.000
because you shouldn't be wearing them
when you hear this.

49:51.166 --> 49:54.875
And given what happened today,
you need to be very, very careful.

49:55.708 --> 49:56.750
As will we.

49:57.791 --> 49:58.791
Understood?

50:00.875 --> 50:01.916
Turn around.

50:17.583 --> 50:18.791
You can face me.

50:23.125 --> 50:25.250
We're at Samaritan Hospital Center.

50:26.166 --> 50:28.625
Your cousin is being Med-evaced
here as we speak.

50:28.625 --> 50:31.541
He's coming from the infirmary,
so we're a little ahead of 'em.

50:31.541 --> 50:33.333
- Is he alive?
- He was attacked.

50:34.541 --> 50:35.958
Just out of processing.

50:36.666 --> 50:38.958
I do not know his current condition.

50:39.750 --> 50:42.416
When I talked to Corrections,
they said he was...

50:43.666 --> 50:44.791
stabbed up pretty good.

50:46.833 --> 50:48.625
I fucking told you!

50:48.625 --> 50:52.625
Now, you see, that's what
we can't be hearing from you right now.

50:53.291 --> 50:55.125
What do you want to hear from me?

50:55.625 --> 50:57.750
Well, this is tough to take in, so

50:58.458 --> 51:00.291
maybe just focus on that.

51:01.833 --> 51:04.791
We could be throwing blame
around here all night, okay?

51:06.125 --> 51:08.708
Just because you was right,
doesn't make us wrong.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.166
Right now, you gotta choose

51:12.000 --> 51:13.583
between a bag full of money

51:13.583 --> 51:15.625
and our deepest sympathies,

51:16.791 --> 51:18.208
or 30 years minimum.

51:18.833 --> 51:22.375
Or worse, if you can't stay in control.

51:23.458 --> 51:24.958
To what? Walk away?

51:24.958 --> 51:27.291
You had a plan, right?

51:32.166 --> 51:35.750
Paid in full. More than makes up
for the bail you're short.

51:35.750 --> 51:37.541
I didn't ask to get paid off.

51:37.541 --> 51:39.916
Son, I'm trying to make you whole.

51:39.916 --> 51:44.208
Now go haul boats,
or sell that truck for cash.

51:44.208 --> 51:47.750
Whatever you decide to do,
you do it damn far from here

51:47.750 --> 51:50.083
because if you enter this township again,

51:51.250 --> 51:52.583
this'll go another route.

51:54.750 --> 51:58.500
- Aw, come on, this smells way off.
- Not for a steaming pile of shit.

52:01.083 --> 52:02.083
That's your bird.

52:03.208 --> 52:04.500
This is your deal.

52:05.166 --> 52:06.583
All you gotta do

52:07.458 --> 52:08.375
is nothing.

52:08.958 --> 52:10.250
What am I gonna say?

52:11.375 --> 52:12.541
You say "okay."

52:17.916 --> 52:19.458
Okay.

52:19.458 --> 52:22.125
Hey, you want to keep that nice.

52:22.125 --> 52:24.166
Seller's expecting you.

52:24.166 --> 52:26.291
You don't take possession by tonight,

52:26.791 --> 52:28.750
I'm going to assume the deal's off.

52:30.125 --> 52:31.791
Then we go that other route.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.125
You're free to go.

52:59.791 --> 53:01.833
He's not really in the system yet.

53:01.833 --> 53:03.375
Pops up as "in transit."

53:05.375 --> 53:07.000
He put you down as next of kin.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.666
So I'm seeing if you can claim the remains
here, or if they have to go back.

53:10.666 --> 53:13.541
Coroner might put the body on hold
since it was a homicide.

53:13.541 --> 53:17.500
So I guess just stay in touch with
our office until they figure it all out.

53:20.291 --> 53:21.541
Could you take those off?

53:22.875 --> 53:23.875
Sure.

54:27.291 --> 54:28.250
All set?

54:30.125 --> 54:31.041
Yeah.

54:40.166 --> 54:41.583
I salvaged your bike.

54:43.666 --> 54:45.708
If you want to swing by my house
and grab it.

54:45.708 --> 54:46.791
Pawn it.

54:47.333 --> 54:49.583
- It's worth a couple grand.
- I see 'em.

54:50.958 --> 54:54.125
- It's not what you think.
- Be smart. No way he just lets me go.

54:54.125 --> 54:56.041
He's worried about November.

54:56.875 --> 54:58.500
Makin' a run for Sheriff.

55:08.083 --> 55:10.458
That's real, what I found.

55:13.583 --> 55:15.250
I don't know what this is.

55:16.041 --> 55:18.625
Case records that don't match up
with the bail schedule.

55:18.625 --> 55:19.708
And I don't care.

55:21.291 --> 55:22.750
There's dozens.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.291
Look, Terry, I...

55:29.125 --> 55:31.166
I know now is not the time.

55:32.166 --> 55:33.541
It's just we don't have any--

55:33.541 --> 55:36.291
When we cross to the next town,
we should get some food.

55:37.333 --> 55:39.000
Can't remember my last meal.

55:39.500 --> 55:41.375
Someone wanted Mike in jail.

55:42.375 --> 55:43.250
The others too.

55:43.250 --> 55:45.625
To what end? I don't know.
They all end up walking.

55:45.625 --> 55:48.541
But they were in for 90 days.

55:48.541 --> 55:49.708
No more. No less.

55:49.708 --> 55:52.625
Waiting to be arraigned on charges
that don't carry jail time.

55:52.625 --> 55:54.458
I don't doubt what you're saying.

55:55.250 --> 55:58.875
But if the revelation is that
your Bama-ass town is corrupt

55:59.458 --> 56:02.166
and my cousin and whoever else
got fucked over,

56:02.166 --> 56:03.416
I don't need convincing.

56:04.250 --> 56:06.250
I didn't come here to set things right.

56:07.083 --> 56:10.291
I just wanted Mike not dead.
Yet here we are.

56:10.291 --> 56:11.833
They can't just run you off.

56:11.833 --> 56:15.375
Never. It's called tactical retrograde,
and I got off easy.

56:16.500 --> 56:19.250
- Well, I can keep digging--
- Respectfully, no.

56:20.833 --> 56:23.666
All I need is transpo the fuck outta here.

56:24.208 --> 56:28.583
And if that's no longer cool, you can
drop me off at the next bus station.

56:35.041 --> 56:37.291
Bus station's past where we're headed.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.000
Whatever I say

57:20.666 --> 57:21.916
is gonna fall short.

57:23.375 --> 57:24.875
You got something to write on?

57:36.166 --> 57:37.333
Think it over.

57:38.250 --> 57:39.791
Text me something profound.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.916
- Thought you didn't give this out.
- Yeah, well...

57:44.000 --> 57:45.875
All that aside, back there,

57:47.291 --> 57:48.708
I appreciate you giving a shit.

57:48.708 --> 57:52.708
Well, I appreciate your appreciation.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.666
You here for the dually?

58:22.791 --> 58:23.708
I am.

58:24.541 --> 58:25.458
Yes, sir.

58:25.958 --> 58:27.875
I'll let you take a look at her.

58:45.583 --> 58:47.625
Move. Don't touch shit.

59:14.041 --> 59:15.041
No.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.583
Terry!

01:00:22.416 --> 01:00:24.208
Mm... I'm in trouble.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.250
Summer!

01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:00.958
Hey!

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.083
Summer!

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:22.125
It's okay.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.458
<i>That's the proof.
I'll tell you that right now.</i>

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:28.541
What about another city?

01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:30.541
Another state?

01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:32.750
It'll still go on my medical history.

01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:36.333
So, you're gonna risk dying?

01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:39.041
- Wasn't enough to hurt me.
- How do you know?

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:42.666
- I can tell.
- So what'd they put in you?

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:46.500
- The dosage? You an "almost doctor" too?
- I fuckin' know, Terry.

01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:50.083
I go to a hospital, it gets reported.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.666
And if it's reported, the judge...

01:01:56.291 --> 01:01:57.875
Everything gets unsealed.

01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:01.208
I'll never get back custody.

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:05.291
They'll tell my little girl.

01:02:06.958 --> 01:02:09.416
- I can forget about taking the bar.

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:11.958
What's that?

01:02:12.666 --> 01:02:14.000
That's your oatmeal.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.458
How can they hold it against you?

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:20.875
I'm sure a lot of lawyers
struggle with that.

01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:22.041
Addiction?

01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:23.166
Yeah.

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:28.666
Related crimes of moral turpitude,
not so much.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.083
I pawned a ride-on mower that wasn't mine.

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:42.958
My father-in-law's.

01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:45.083
Mm-mm.

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:50.166
My husband petitioned for divorce
soon as I was charged.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.375
Took our kid.

01:02:52.375 --> 01:02:54.833
He was just waiting to pounce.
I was a wreck.

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:59.125
Didn't contest anything they put forward.

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:00.625
Couldn't afford a lawyer.

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:02.041
Um...

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.791
I just sat there in court

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:08.333
listening to how horrible a mother I was.

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:13.750
- Made a pretty solid case.
- Hey. Come on now.

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:16.875
You know what's funny?

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:21.083
When I took the mower...

01:03:21.083 --> 01:03:23.541
...it had this snowblower attachment on it.

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:26.833
I left it on
when I rolled it out the shed,

01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:31.000
and that's what bumped the value
from petty theft up to grand theft.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:35.416
I'm a felon

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:38.291
because of a lawn mower accessory.

01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:42.166
What?

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:45.416
Nothing. Go on.

01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:47.333
Tell me.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:54.500
I was just going to say that blows.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.500
Go on. I want to hear this.

01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:00.708
That's about it.

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:02.583
The judge took pity on me.

01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:05.083
I promised to stay clean.

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:08.791
He sealed everything up,
and I went to work for the court.

01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:11.541
Figured however things turned out,

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:13.875
I'd never not be able
to defend myself again.

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:15.333
Yeah, I hear that.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.500
What can I do?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.250
You were right.

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:24.708
You should go.

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:27.750
You should grieve.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:28.708
Mm.

01:04:29.208 --> 01:04:30.583
I'll back off.

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:33.791
Show up to work like nothing happened.

01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:35.541
Hey.

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:37.875
You sure you're okay?

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:39.916
How blue are my lips?

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:43.125
Not very.

01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:46.083
Then, yeah.

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:54.375
All this talk of defending myself.

01:04:55.666 --> 01:04:57.708
- Here I am.
- It's the right move.

01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:00.125
Taking fuel away from the fire.

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:02.875
You gotta focus on your girl, you know?

01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:08.208
I won't forget about Mike.

01:05:12.291 --> 01:05:13.875
I'll get this truck off your lawn.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.541
Morning.

01:05:41.791 --> 01:05:44.250
- Morning, Alex.
Morning, Ms. McBride.

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:48.791
Oh, hey. You're supposed to
go see the judge first thing.

01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:49.875
Okay.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:58.000
Those were the terms
of your employment, were they not?

01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:00.416
They were.

01:06:00.416 --> 01:06:04.666
And you understand I can only act
on the information given me.

01:06:06.458 --> 01:06:07.791
But it's not true.

01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:09.416
That's not me.

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:11.416
I believe you.

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:15.291
If there's nothing to it,
then there's nothing to it.

01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:17.125
Test's not gonna lie.

01:06:17.916 --> 01:06:20.208
If you wouldn't mind
emptying your pockets, please.

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:24.375
Oh, and leave your purse.
Victoria here will take you in.

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:36.875
You all right in there, hon?

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:05.541
Shit.

01:08:01.166 --> 01:08:03.416
<i>We're good up here.</i>

01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:12.041
<i>106, you're clear.</i>

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.458
Kill that ignition!

01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:28.875
Now toss your keys out the driver's side.

01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:43.916
My hands good?

01:08:45.583 --> 01:08:46.500
Sure.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.083
Ten and two.

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:51.791
Your lights broken?

01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:53.000
How do you mean?

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.916
It's just you waved me down.

01:08:55.916 --> 01:08:58.750
So I'm wondering
if something's wrong with your lights.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.791
Something wrong with your GPS?

01:09:01.666 --> 01:09:03.166
It was an emergency.

01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:05.875
You respond to emergencies
around here now?

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.791
- It was just a friend.
- Yeah?

01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:11.291
She turned out to be
more trouble than you.

01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:13.000
It was a false alarm.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.500
You'll never see me again.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.416
That conversation was had.

01:09:17.375 --> 01:09:20.000
Chief handed you a winning lotto ticket.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.375
And you just tore it up.

01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:24.916
We got a dozen witnesses
saw you storm the station.

01:09:24.916 --> 01:09:27.250
Your prints are
all over the property cage,

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.166
and there's a missing bag of money.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.583
I'm guessing,
we'll find it right here in this truck.

01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:34.916
Feeling smart now?

01:09:35.708 --> 01:09:36.750
No, sir.

01:09:39.583 --> 01:09:42.916
I'll give you credit
for catching the lights though.

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:46.291
Pretty sharp.

01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:51.458
These new cruisers,

01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:53.958
you run the lights...

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.166
the dash cam starts recording.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.125
- Gun!

01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:05.916
- Fuck!

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.083
<i>What are we doing?</i>

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.708
Help!

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.291
<i>Shots fired with that buckshot!</i>

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.250
I got him! Clear out!

01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:40.666
- Get out of the truck!

01:10:40.666 --> 01:10:42.250
- Move!

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:51.500
Hit the fuckin' tires!

01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:24.333
You know you can't be here,

01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.958
not without a heads-up.

01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:32.000
We didn't call anybody.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:37.291
Shit.

01:12:51.291 --> 01:12:53.791
<i>Terry? Terry?</i>

01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:56.166
You should stay off the phone.
I was coming to you.

01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:59.250
<i>Don't.
I just got a visit from the police.</i>

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.250
Yeah, me too.

01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:03.333
You okay? You hurt?

01:13:03.333 --> 01:13:05.208
<i>They came to warn me.</i>

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:08.375
<i>Said I should leave town.
Stay away from you.</i>

01:13:08.916 --> 01:13:11.166
Yeah, solid recs. Who was it?

01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:14.750
<i>A friend,
same one who followed us yesterday.</i>

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.833
<i>- That was for me, not you.</i>

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:18.791
You mobile?

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:21.833
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm packing up.</i>

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.375
All right.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:26.041
That Volvo, you own it?

01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:28.791
<i>Only thing in my life
that's paid off.</i>

01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:31.541
Okay.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.125
Um...

01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:36.125
Bring your title.
I got somewhere we can go.

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:38.375
<i>Should I pick you up?</i>

01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:40.916
No. I'll be good.

01:13:44.708 --> 01:13:45.791
All right.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.166
Don't write this down.

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.041
Okay.

01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:56.125
Summer?

01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:01.083
Kan Long Chinese, go ahead.

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:05.375
Uh, no brown.
White, fried, or sticky only.

01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:08.333
Uh-huh.

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.500
Uh, shrimp's a dollar more.

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:22.500
Two soups.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.416
No. Special soups.

01:14:33.208 --> 01:14:35.833
Another round of beers, table six.
- Uh-huh.

01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:46.208
And what's your address?

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:05.166
Oh my God, are you shot?

01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:07.625
Yeah. Summer, this is Mr. Liu.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.583
Hi. Sorry, I would have driven faster.

01:15:13.583 --> 01:15:18.166
They had Quikclot, but I wasn't sure
if it was the gauze or the sponge, so

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:20.583
I got both.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.250
- Burners?
Yeah.

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:23.500
Thank you.

01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:27.250
And I got coconut water. If you want some.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:28.541
No, I'm good.

01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:31.083
Ah, traveled down pretty clean.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:32.416
Still a couple fragments,

01:15:32.416 --> 01:15:35.458
but I'll leave it in
if you're gonna be moving around.

01:15:35.458 --> 01:15:37.250
You should be at a hospital.

01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:40.083
Look who's talking.

01:15:41.083 --> 01:15:42.250
This is different.

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:45.625
Yeah, well,
Mr. Liu was a field medic in Korea.

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:46.583
Oh.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.916
Thank you for your service, sir.

01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:54.958
He's Chinese.

01:15:56.083 --> 01:15:57.875
Fought for the other side.

01:15:57.875 --> 01:16:01.000
Well, it's good we can all come together.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.958
Make sure he finishes his.

01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:12.333
Hm.

01:16:22.083 --> 01:16:24.208
Walk me through it.

01:16:24.208 --> 01:16:25.541
I want everything.

01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:29.041
It's just I didn't get that far.
- It's what's keeping me alive.

01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:32.375
They just tried to kill you.

01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:34.666
And no one's called in the cavalry.

01:16:34.666 --> 01:16:38.250
With what they could pin on me, should be
a federal task force dropping a tac team

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:39.750
on the roof right now.

01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:45.083
- They're keeping it quiet.
- Because of what you found.

01:16:45.666 --> 01:16:46.708
So...

01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:51.500
From what I pulled, it's clear they're
manipulating defendants' jail time.

01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:55.666
What's driving it? I don't know.
That's what they're protecting.

01:16:55.666 --> 01:16:58.541
They got your folder, right?
So it's not just what you pulled.

01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:00.791
No. Folder's why they're onto us.

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:03.833
The case files are public record.
Anyone can look 'em up.

01:17:03.833 --> 01:17:06.708
Okay, so is that enough
to take to the press, start a ruckus?

01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:09.625
No, holding them for 90 days, hiking bail,

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:12.708
the individual acts
aren't necessarily illegal.

01:17:12.708 --> 01:17:14.208
It's discretion of the court,

01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:17.333
so the judge can double your fine
for tracking mud on his floor.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:18.375
So he's in on it.

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:20.833
When the cases do reach his bench,

01:17:20.833 --> 01:17:23.875
he lets 'em off, mostly full dismissals.

01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:26.791
If anything, he's pushing back.

01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:29.333
So we get kinetic.
Find out what he's pushing against.

01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:31.083
We're over the town line.

01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:33.833
- We should keep going.
- Yeah, well, maybe you.

01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:38.083
These officers are quiet
because they're vulnerable.

01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:42.250
Whatever window we have,

01:17:43.708 --> 01:17:45.458
I guarantee you they're closing it.

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:48.375
They do,

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.458
I'm dead.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.875
Won't matter where I am.

01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:54.333
You think me too?

01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:58.541
Bottom line up front?

01:18:01.166 --> 01:18:03.208
I don't see how they let you walk away.

01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:05.625
Who knows?

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:09.166
Maybe they'll cut you a deal.

01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:10.666
Hell, they let me walk.

01:18:10.666 --> 01:18:13.708
- Then I pulled you back in.
- Yeah, and it's good you did.

01:18:15.083 --> 01:18:17.000
When they sent me on my way...

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:20.833
I was grateful.

01:18:23.083 --> 01:18:27.208
Like my whole life was back ahead of me.
I even heard Mike telling me it was okay.

01:18:29.166 --> 01:18:30.208
How I train,

01:18:30.833 --> 01:18:33.541
what I teach, most of it
comes down to self-preservation.

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:35.666
So I guess I just acted accordingly.

01:18:36.166 --> 01:18:37.041
Anyone would.

01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:39.208
Yeah, but the chief didn't give me an out.

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.083
I gave him one.

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:44.666
And that wasn't Mike's voice.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.583
That was mine.

01:18:47.166 --> 01:18:48.500
This shit's far from okay,

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.333
and these cops might end up on top.

01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:55.666
I'm not pretending here, but they
sure as shit don't get any more outs.

01:18:58.333 --> 01:18:59.166
And Mike,

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:01.750
I hope he's in a better place.

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:05.500
I don't know enough about the afterlife
to trust in it, so while I'm here,

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:07.583
and he's not,

01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:11.208
I gotta haunt these motherfuckers myself.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.666
All right?

01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:18.125
What about taking fuel away from the fire?

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:19.708
Mm. It's different now.

01:19:20.291 --> 01:19:21.166
How so?

01:19:25.666 --> 01:19:26.750
We're the fire.

01:19:58.958 --> 01:20:01.083
What about your friend
on the force?

01:20:03.375 --> 01:20:06.208
- Think he'd be willing to talk?
- Never said it was a he.

01:20:06.208 --> 01:20:08.250
"He," "she" fine.

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.541
Codename "Serpico."

01:20:10.666 --> 01:20:13.125
Would they talk?
Take this to the state police?

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.166
No, they were clear on that.

01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:19.083
Warning me was risky enough.

01:20:20.291 --> 01:20:21.208
You all right?

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:26.708
Just have a feeling
tonight's going to get pretty dark.

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:32.250
Isn't that what nights do?

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:36.041
<i>Okay, three, two, one,</i>

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:37.083
go!

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:41.333
First is Isaiah!

01:20:41.333 --> 01:20:44.791
Ryan in second,
Jack's in third, Henry fourth!

01:20:44.791 --> 01:20:45.833
Nice heat, guys!

01:20:45.833 --> 01:20:47.666
All right, let's bring those back...

01:20:48.166 --> 01:20:49.125
Hey, buddy!

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:51.041
Summer!

01:20:51.041 --> 01:20:52.250
How'd you do?

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:54.875
Bad. I got taken out
in the fourth-place runoff.

01:20:57.708 --> 01:20:59.041
Super cool.

01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:03.375
At least you made it yourself. You're
mostly competing against other dads.

01:21:03.375 --> 01:21:05.541
Ben. Go cheer.

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:12.458
All right, let's see if we can get
a new leader out there! Ready?

01:21:12.458 --> 01:21:15.208
We know they're locking
defendants up and letting them go.

01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:17.791
We have no idea why,
but our local PD is willing to kill

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.333
to keep us from finding out.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:22.166
- They came into my home!
- What do you want me to say?

01:21:22.166 --> 01:21:24.750
- That you're on the right path?
- Are we?

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.541
I can't answer your questions.

01:21:38.541 --> 01:21:40.916
- Fuck this guy.
- It'd be aiding and abetting.

01:21:40.916 --> 01:21:44.708
Whatever it is you're doing,
I can be named an accessory.

01:21:44.708 --> 01:21:47.833
I don't report you the minute you leave,
it could be seen as a failure to act.

01:21:47.833 --> 01:21:51.875
If I inflict pain before you answer,
does that help from a legal standpoint?

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:55.208
Listen. Even if I wanted to,
I don't have the answers to give.

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:57.125
Okay? And that's by design.

01:21:58.375 --> 01:22:00.333
- I don't want to know.
- No, that!

01:22:01.791 --> 01:22:02.625
You!

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:06.708
You're a fucking tumor, Elliot!

01:22:18.791 --> 01:22:19.791
If I did...

01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:24.583
If I did want to know...

01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:29.875
- I would have some questions.
- Yeah, like what?

01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:36.041
Like how far back does it go?
What you found.

01:22:36.041 --> 01:22:38.416
Mostly recent, less than two years.

01:22:38.416 --> 01:22:42.791
- Mm-hm. Why is that?
- I searched bail records. Uh...

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.333
Probably didn't dig deep enough.

01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:47.000
Or?

01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:51.708
That's as deep as it goes?

01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:55.625
- And if that's true, I would also wonder...

01:22:55.625 --> 01:22:58.125
...was there something that coincided
in that timeframe?

01:22:58.125 --> 01:23:00.541
Something pertinent?

01:23:02.458 --> 01:23:04.083
- The civil case?
Dad!

01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:07.458
Isaiah won again. Can we go now?

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:09.375
Yes.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.333
Hey!

01:23:11.333 --> 01:23:14.833
That case, the settlement,
it put pressure on the police.

01:23:14.833 --> 01:23:16.208
Oversight.

01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:18.291
- Turned things around.
- Did it?

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:20.208
It's been quiet ever since.

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:24.750
So there's your big question.

01:23:29.791 --> 01:23:31.750
You got no answers from me.

01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:38.083
Lawsuit didn't
turn things around.

01:23:38.708 --> 01:23:40.250
Turned them upside down.

01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:55.458
<i>Well, this is a surprise.</i>

01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:58.875
<i>- A commission in the cavalry, too, huh?</i>

01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:02.083
<i>I see you got
the commission you were after.</i>

01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:05.375
<i>You know these men, Rader?</i>
<i>Yes, sir, very well.</i>

01:24:05.375 --> 01:24:08.166
<i>This one, Stuart, comes from
a rich slave owning family in Virginia.</i>

01:24:09.333 --> 01:24:12.333
<i>He called you a lying renegade once,
and I jumped him for it--</i>

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.041
- It's okay.

01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:19.208
I'll talk.

01:24:32.375 --> 01:24:33.500
Jesus.

01:24:34.416 --> 01:24:36.208
There's no need to hurt me.

01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:42.625
Where's Summer?

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:44.458
Don't know.

01:24:45.708 --> 01:24:48.125
- I was gonna ask you.
- Elliot called.

01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:51.833
- I need for her to hear this.
Who? What? Where?

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:53.000
No time for why.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.166
- She's owed it.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.708
Would you believe
I was protecting you this morning?

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:02.708
I'm sure you convinced yourself.

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:07.458
I was afraid they'd do worse,
and I'm deeply sorry about your brother.

01:25:07.458 --> 01:25:08.541
Cousin.

01:25:09.375 --> 01:25:10.625
Your cousin.

01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:17.000
So why is he dead?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.208
<i>- Bishop v The Town of Shelby Springs.</i>
- You're familiar with it?

01:25:21.208 --> 01:25:24.666
Just some of the fallout.
That the chief was named personally.

01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:27.208
Illegal search snowballed
into a wrongful death.

01:25:27.208 --> 01:25:30.083
Settlement damn near bankrupted the town.

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:32.791
His department was deemed uninsurable.

01:25:32.791 --> 01:25:35.916
Got a year to modernize, clean up its act.

01:25:35.916 --> 01:25:37.625
And it did, on paper.

01:25:37.625 --> 01:25:39.208
Uh-huh, on paper.

01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:42.541
So you sell out your bench
to protect Sandy Burnne?

01:25:42.541 --> 01:25:44.791
Hell no, we wanted him gone.

01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:47.166
The reform mandate
was a ploy to shut him down,

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:49.500
hand over our contract
to the state police.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.291
There was no money for him to comply.

01:25:52.291 --> 01:25:54.083
So he goes out, gets his own.

01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:56.708
Did 100,000
in forfeitures his first month.

01:25:56.708 --> 01:25:59.333
- He cut you in on it?
- Me and every other taxpayer.

01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:01.625
They seized my cash.
You told me it was legal.

01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:03.583
It is. That's what I don't get.

01:26:03.583 --> 01:26:07.541
That money flows back into debt service,
payroll, public works.

01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:09.458
That's Christmas lights in December,

01:26:09.458 --> 01:26:13.958
fireworks on the Fourth of July,
and a nice little old tax cut on top.

01:26:13.958 --> 01:26:15.583
Everyone holds their seat.

01:26:15.583 --> 01:26:19.125
But how are a handful of misdemeanor
defendants a threat to all this?

01:26:19.125 --> 01:26:21.791
And boil this shit down... quick.

01:26:21.791 --> 01:26:23.083
Liability.

01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:25.708
Traffic stop goes wrong,

01:26:25.708 --> 01:26:26.875
an arrest gets rough,

01:26:26.875 --> 01:26:31.166
anything that might put the department
in legal jeopardy, they'll flag the case.

01:26:31.166 --> 01:26:33.208
Kick the charges down to misdemeanors.

01:26:33.208 --> 01:26:35.125
So it stays in town court.

01:26:36.166 --> 01:26:39.291
Where there's no public defender
to contest the bail or adjournments.

01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:41.916
- Keep 'em in purgatory.
For 90 days.

01:26:41.916 --> 01:26:43.625
Why is it always 90 days?

01:26:43.625 --> 01:26:46.458
I guess if I was smarter,
I'd have mixed that up some.

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:49.625
Didn't want to hold them
a day longer than we had to.

01:26:50.833 --> 01:26:52.416
The retention period?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Shit.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.416
The hard drives at the courthouse.

01:26:57.375 --> 01:26:58.916
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:26:59.458 --> 01:27:03.000
Their dash cam videos.
It's part of the settlement.

01:27:03.875 --> 01:27:06.750
We store their footage.
They can't access it on their own.

01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:08.041
But you can?

01:27:08.041 --> 01:27:10.375
Only if it's deemed evidentiary.

01:27:10.375 --> 01:27:14.166
If it's not held or subpoenaed
for 90 days, it's deleted.

01:27:18.083 --> 01:27:19.375
All right.

01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:21.750
What's on Mike's video?

01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:25.458
- What'd they do to him?
- Enough to get us sued.

01:27:25.458 --> 01:27:27.166
- Have you seen it?
- No.

01:27:27.166 --> 01:27:30.416
Let me guess.
You don't wanna fucking know.

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:32.583
Wouldn't matter if I did.

01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:35.416
Lose another lawsuit
and it's disincorporation,

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:38.708
Shelby Springs disappears.
Swallowed up by the parish.

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:43.500
- Y'all gonna leave me like this?
- What, alive? Yeah. For now.

01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:46.541
You knew Judy.

01:27:47.083 --> 01:27:48.958
What would she think about all this?

01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:50.625
What you're doing to me.

01:27:50.625 --> 01:27:52.625
Well, if she knew what you did...

01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:57.416
she'd want to watch.

01:28:01.083 --> 01:28:04.333
These yours?
Need to take one before we go?

01:28:04.333 --> 01:28:06.416
Mm, I'm good for the night.

01:28:07.083 --> 01:28:10.250
This is his wife's... and it's empty.

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:13.375
Oh, shit. I forgot to feed the cat.

01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:15.083
Shit.
- Would you mind?

01:28:15.083 --> 01:28:17.250
Hey, how many did you take?

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.166
Where's the fucking cat food?

01:28:37.166 --> 01:28:39.958
- Hey.

01:28:39.958 --> 01:28:42.041
- You think he'll make it?

01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:45.083
Yeah.

01:28:45.083 --> 01:28:48.375
Hey, it's cool if you gotta step back,
start thinking about your girl.

01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:51.625
She never left my mind in there.

01:28:52.375 --> 01:28:55.250
Him, Elliot,

01:28:55.833 --> 01:28:59.375
this whole fucking town couldn't form
a single spine between them.

01:29:03.833 --> 01:29:05.958
- If I do get her back--
- <i>When</i> you get her back.

01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:08.000
She's gotta know I got one.

01:29:10.041 --> 01:29:12.416
Where do you keep the drives?
- Basement.

01:29:12.416 --> 01:29:13.625
The catacombs?

01:29:13.625 --> 01:29:15.541
Yeah, but there's an alarm.

01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:17.875
Yeah. And moisture.

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:19.791
And a lot of rot.

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:44.750
You got it?
Yeah.

01:30:04.583 --> 01:30:06.333
I love it down here.

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:08.083
You can smell the history.

01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:09.250
Where to?

01:30:44.541 --> 01:30:47.166
I can't see.
Let your eyes adjust.

01:30:47.166 --> 01:30:49.250
Don't wanna go out like Watergate.

01:30:50.541 --> 01:30:52.500
Thanks.
That ain't me.

01:31:09.125 --> 01:31:10.833
A dummy check and we're out.

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:21.666
Come on.

01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:44.416
You smell that?

01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:47.833
That ain't history.

01:31:49.916 --> 01:31:51.833
Let's leave.

01:31:51.833 --> 01:31:53.375
Oh, shit!

01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:58.500
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Shit!

01:32:05.541 --> 01:32:06.541
Coconut water.

01:32:08.041 --> 01:32:11.666
All right, they're expecting
a blaze. We got 30 seconds tops.

01:32:11.666 --> 01:32:14.041
Okay, pull those. I'll get these.

01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:24.291
Damn it.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:27.791
Okay, we exfil.

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:30.458
Weigh our options.

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:31.666
Hold on.

01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:33.958
SD cards.

01:32:33.958 --> 01:32:36.708
They write over 'em in the field
so they never get wiped.

01:32:36.708 --> 01:32:38.291
Straight from their dash cams.

01:32:38.291 --> 01:32:40.708
- It's just last week's but--
- Mike's in there?

01:32:43.458 --> 01:32:44.500
All right.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:53.208
Wait.

01:32:54.583 --> 01:32:55.958
What are you doing?

01:32:55.958 --> 01:32:58.083
- If we don't restart it, they will.

01:32:58.083 --> 01:32:59.333
It's a landmarked building.

01:32:59.333 --> 01:33:02.041
That "history" down here,
for a lot of people?

01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:03.833
It's got a pretty foul funk to it.

01:33:06.291 --> 01:33:09.208
Yeah. Let it burn.

01:33:14.541 --> 01:33:15.583
Looking now.

01:33:15.583 --> 01:33:17.791
Just to be sure. Just in case. Go!

01:33:22.166 --> 01:33:23.916
We're good! Move!

01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:27.250
Sweep the courthouse, then we're out.

01:33:39.125 --> 01:33:41.666
- You go.
- <i>We</i> go. We got 'em.

01:33:41.666 --> 01:33:43.958
No. Start the car. I can't...

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.208
- I gotta get something back.

01:33:48.208 --> 01:33:49.958
That'll send 'em running.

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.708
Go slow, go steady.

01:33:52.708 --> 01:33:54.750
Meet me in the alley. Yeah?

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:55.833
Yeah.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Fuck!

01:35:14.625 --> 01:35:15.500
Bingo!

01:35:16.458 --> 01:35:17.958
You're kiddin'.

01:35:21.083 --> 01:35:23.208
How's that for a dummy check?

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:48.666
Turn that shit off!

01:35:50.416 --> 01:35:52.416
- Come on. Come on.

01:35:59.958 --> 01:36:01.041
Fuck.

01:37:45.833 --> 01:37:47.083
Fuck! Fuck!

01:37:47.791 --> 01:37:48.791
Shit!

01:37:50.208 --> 01:37:51.791
Get the fuck off me!

01:38:10.083 --> 01:38:12.208
You wanna be asleep
when I cuff you or awake?

01:38:12.208 --> 01:38:13.875
All right, okay!

01:38:16.875 --> 01:38:18.041
Fuck!

01:38:35.291 --> 01:38:37.250
Had to assume you'd shoot on sight.

01:38:38.083 --> 01:38:39.208
Is she hurt?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.541
Not that I could tell, no.

01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:43.125
Where are they taking her?

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:46.416
I don't know.
Look, man. We're not all, like...

01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:50.041
I'm married. Okay? Okay. Hey, hey.

01:38:50.041 --> 01:38:51.916
I got a kid. So...

01:38:53.666 --> 01:38:54.583
Yeah?

01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:56.750
So does she.

01:38:58.583 --> 01:39:00.791
So let's not waste any fucking time.

01:39:04.583 --> 01:39:05.541
Get up.

01:39:14.583 --> 01:39:16.500
Get me someone who knows.

01:39:21.166 --> 01:39:22.750
106, come in.

01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:24.750
This is 103.

01:39:30.083 --> 01:39:32.666
<i>103, we're 10-3. Keep it quiet.</i>

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.208
106, is that in regards
to the arson or the kidnapping? Over.

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:46.625
You got ten seconds
before I start trying new frequencies.

01:39:46.625 --> 01:39:48.541
Got some cards I wanna offload.

01:39:55.625 --> 01:39:56.916
Left utility pocket.

01:40:05.583 --> 01:40:07.083
<i>What brand are they?</i>

01:40:17.583 --> 01:40:19.791
Extreme Pro, 64 gigs.

01:40:22.708 --> 01:40:25.458
<i>Okay, then. You know Rebel Ridge?</i>

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:27.416
No.

01:40:27.416 --> 01:40:29.916
<i>Drop you a pin. Settle up.</i>

01:40:30.666 --> 01:40:31.583
A swap?

01:40:32.458 --> 01:40:33.916
You think I'm stupid?

01:40:33.916 --> 01:40:36.208
<i>No. I think you're smart.</i>

01:40:39.291 --> 01:40:40.750
Fuck it. First light.

01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:42.666
<i>How about right now?</i>

01:40:42.666 --> 01:40:44.958
No, I got to see what's waiting for me.

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:48.083
Works out well for you too.

01:40:48.666 --> 01:40:49.666
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

01:40:50.333 --> 01:40:51.250
Yeah.

01:40:52.666 --> 01:40:54.458
You just might see me comin'.

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.458
I put too much sauce on that?

01:41:06.083 --> 01:41:07.916
- Pop the trunk.
- Fuck.

01:41:33.583 --> 01:41:34.833
What you got in that?

01:41:35.666 --> 01:41:38.166
Number 4 buck, double-aught following.

01:41:44.583 --> 01:41:46.166
Lose the number 4,

01:41:47.208 --> 01:41:48.791
load up some slugs

01:41:49.833 --> 01:41:51.583
'case he grabs hold of someone.

01:42:17.791 --> 01:42:19.375
Check in with Patrol.

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:21.125
He should be here.

01:42:21.625 --> 01:42:22.750
Sun's barely up.

01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:28.250
If he isn't early, he's late.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Yeah?

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.500
Hello?

01:42:42.541 --> 01:42:44.166
You know what's funny, Chief?

01:42:45.458 --> 01:42:48.708
You know,
nothing comes to mind right off-hand.

01:42:48.708 --> 01:42:51.958
Before two days ago,
I'd never really been in a street fight.

01:42:52.875 --> 01:42:55.958
I mean, a few scraps in a schoolyard,

01:42:55.958 --> 01:42:59.333
<i>but other than that,
nothing outside the gym.</i>

01:43:00.583 --> 01:43:02.458
Well, I've been in plenty.

01:43:02.458 --> 01:43:04.083
<i>Yeah, I can feel that from you.</i>

01:43:04.083 --> 01:43:06.416
That combative energy.

01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:09.083
<i>It builds up. You know?</i>

01:43:11.083 --> 01:43:13.458
<i>108.
Got a visual on our suspect.</i>

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.541
<i>It's not just you. I know.</i>

01:43:17.666 --> 01:43:20.041
- They're on him.
<i>Both sides contribute.</i>

01:43:21.791 --> 01:43:25.541
Are you taking responsibility
or dodging it?

01:43:25.541 --> 01:43:27.166
<i>108, can you confirm?</i>

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:31.500
Stand by.

01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:34.375
<i>Copy you, 108.</i>

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:36.583
<i>Standing by. 10--</i>

01:43:39.791 --> 01:43:41.666
<i>Pack it up. He's ready to move.</i>

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:46.541
<i>People getting hurt now
either way. The fire last night...</i>

01:43:47.791 --> 01:43:50.791
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- Yeah, it's gotten out of hand.

01:43:51.833 --> 01:43:53.583
Real soup sandwich.

01:43:53.583 --> 01:43:55.083
We can agree on that.

01:43:55.625 --> 01:43:58.875
Got me thinking about
that conversation we had in the cruiser,

01:43:58.875 --> 01:44:00.125
about de-escalation.

01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:04.083
<i>That also takes both sides, you know?</i>

01:44:05.041 --> 01:44:06.458
So I was thinking,

01:44:07.791 --> 01:44:09.541
what if we just walk away?

01:44:09.541 --> 01:44:13.458
- Well, now you're starting to talk some--
<i>- </i>  But then I was like, "Nah."

01:44:22.166 --> 01:44:24.166
Don't you fucking move!

01:44:24.166 --> 01:44:25.541
Goddamn it!

01:44:25.541 --> 01:44:27.166
Negative! It's McGill.

01:44:27.166 --> 01:44:28.625
Got him all tied up.

01:44:44.125 --> 01:44:46.875
He's goin' for the cash. Get on the radio!

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:50.833
All units, be advised...

01:44:59.791 --> 01:45:01.208
<i>Copy you.</i>

01:45:01.208 --> 01:45:02.500
Piece of shit!

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.208
<i>Repeat, 10-19.</i>

01:45:04.208 --> 01:45:05.875
<i>Suspect is at the station.</i>

01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:09.166
<i>- Request immediate assistance. Hurry.</i>
Find him and leave some for me!

01:45:09.166 --> 01:45:10.958
<i>We got walls coming down.</i>

01:45:13.083 --> 01:45:14.833
<i>Copy. 10-76, en route.</i>

01:45:15.666 --> 01:45:16.750
Something wrong?

01:45:19.166 --> 01:45:20.208
No, actually.

01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:23.333
Think it's all gonna line up pretty well.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.791
Be advised, this is a silent run.

01:45:27.791 --> 01:45:30.041
10-85. Nobody runs code.

01:45:40.416 --> 01:45:44.666
All right, boss? Can you hold off?
We gotta get to the station.

01:45:59.958 --> 01:46:02.333
How'd I know you wouldn't
show up to your own show--

01:46:08.250 --> 01:46:10.083
Hey! It's okay.
- Put that down!

01:46:10.083 --> 01:46:11.708
- Put your weapon down!
- It's okay!

01:46:11.708 --> 01:46:13.833
- Get on the ground! I'm gonna shoot!
- It's okay.

01:46:13.833 --> 01:46:14.958
It's a beanbag round.

01:46:14.958 --> 01:46:17.000
- Less lethal.

01:46:18.458 --> 01:46:20.708
- Listen, I know who you are.
Shoot him!

01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:23.083
Summer didn't give you up.
It ain't hard to narrow down.

01:46:23.083 --> 01:46:25.208
- We call you "Serpico." Hey!
Shoot him!

01:46:25.208 --> 01:46:27.791
Don't worry about him. Worry about her.

01:46:27.791 --> 01:46:30.416
Even if you don't have my back,
I know you got hers.

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.458
- What you want me to do?
- Hear me out.

01:46:33.458 --> 01:46:35.000
Shoot that motherfucker--

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.250
Sit down!

01:46:47.666 --> 01:46:50.750
<i>102, we are at the scene. We got a...</i>

01:46:55.416 --> 01:46:58.250
Whatever's on these,
he's willing to kill over.

01:46:58.250 --> 01:46:59.666
You can go ahead.

01:46:59.666 --> 01:47:03.208
- Release 'em. See what happens.

01:47:03.208 --> 01:47:05.000
Yeah. I'm with you on that.

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:07.333
Got this off your boys, though.

01:47:10.083 --> 01:47:12.291
All right, here's the new deal, Chief.

01:47:12.291 --> 01:47:13.958
I'm seizing your shit.

01:47:15.458 --> 01:47:19.500
When Summer McBride is safe,
I hand myself in to the state police.

01:47:20.375 --> 01:47:21.250
You get it back.

01:47:23.666 --> 01:47:24.666
Otherwise...

01:47:29.666 --> 01:47:30.916
It all burns.

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:38.125
Our guys just pulled up.

01:47:39.958 --> 01:47:40.958
Okay.

01:48:21.625 --> 01:48:24.291
- A lot of hardware out there.
I've seen what you can do.

01:48:24.291 --> 01:48:28.458
So believe me. I'll put two rounds
in your head if you move an inch.

01:48:31.541 --> 01:48:34.166
105 exiting station with suspect.

01:48:34.166 --> 01:48:35.791
Hold your fire. Confirm.

01:48:35.791 --> 01:48:39.458
<i>105, you have Terry Richmond? Over.</i>

01:48:39.458 --> 01:48:42.166
10-4. Confirm. Hold your fire.

01:48:45.791 --> 01:48:47.791
<i>10-4, holding fire.</i>

01:48:52.875 --> 01:48:54.333
Nobody dies today.

01:48:55.833 --> 01:48:57.750
We'll sort this out somewhere safe.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.166
Hands on your head.

01:49:12.666 --> 01:49:13.916
Piece of shit.

01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:15.625
Feel familiar?

01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:17.916
Except for the weight of my gun.

01:49:18.916 --> 01:49:19.750
Stop there.

01:49:20.625 --> 01:49:21.958
Put down the bag.

01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:29.458
Chief's cuffed to the property cage.

01:49:29.458 --> 01:49:31.583
Careful, he's pissed.

01:49:32.166 --> 01:49:33.708
He have drives on him?

01:49:33.708 --> 01:49:36.500
- He did. Says there's some--
- Stolen property.

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.083
Where they at?

01:49:58.541 --> 01:49:59.500
Well done.

01:50:02.291 --> 01:50:04.416
Got to get you out on patrol.

01:50:05.666 --> 01:50:07.416
I feel dumb, man.

01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:10.291
I mean,

01:50:11.375 --> 01:50:12.833
your girl's free to go.

01:50:14.375 --> 01:50:15.625
It's just, uh...

01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:26.708
She's pretty zonked out.

01:50:28.375 --> 01:50:30.958
Thought I gave her a solid search,

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:33.333
but I missed that rig she had on her.

01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:37.500
Must've hidden it somewhere sneaky.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.791
Shot up in the backseat
when I wasn't looking.

01:50:42.708 --> 01:50:45.208
- I'd step back.

01:50:45.208 --> 01:50:48.250
Hold on.
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shhh.

01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:49.708
Listen.

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.833
Oh, man.

01:50:59.166 --> 01:51:00.416
That snoring thing.

01:51:01.416 --> 01:51:02.750
Shit creeps me out.

01:51:04.625 --> 01:51:06.041
At least it'll be peaceful.

01:51:06.041 --> 01:51:08.166
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

01:51:08.166 --> 01:51:10.583
- Step back from the bag.
That's fucked.

01:51:10.583 --> 01:51:11.833
Hold on now, Ev.

01:51:11.833 --> 01:51:13.208
We're okay here.

01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:15.000
- Are we?
Yes, table it.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.541
Once he's in custody
and she's on her way to the ER.

01:51:17.541 --> 01:51:20.666
- We wrap this up here. Let it play out.
We're sworn officers!

01:51:20.666 --> 01:51:25.125
It's a gift. We got her on a legit B&E,
ties her directly to the fire.

01:51:25.125 --> 01:51:28.000
Drives are gone.
She goes away, this all goes away.

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:31.291
We'll get commendations for putting a hole
in this motherfucker's chest!

01:51:31.291 --> 01:51:33.791
- Stand down.
- Do not point your weapon at me!

01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:35.708
- She goes to the fucking hospital!

01:51:35.708 --> 01:51:37.791
You're the shit magnet
that started this!

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:40.041
Stand down! Don't do it!
- Serpico.

01:51:40.041 --> 01:51:42.000
- I won't watch her die!
- Put that weapon down!

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.333
- Sorry, Ev. Goddammit.

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.833
Fuck.
It's just the leg.

01:51:54.958 --> 01:51:58.041
He'll be back on light duty in a week,
drawing full salary.

01:51:59.083 --> 01:52:00.833
Sir, he's bleeding bad.

01:52:03.916 --> 01:52:06.458
Looks like you nicked
something there, Chief.

01:52:06.458 --> 01:52:08.458
- Shit.
Call Medical.

01:52:08.458 --> 01:52:11.125
No! Now, hold on. Hold on.

01:52:11.916 --> 01:52:13.208
Just hold on.

01:52:14.208 --> 01:52:15.458
We all saw it.

01:52:15.458 --> 01:52:17.708
It was either him or... or Steve.

01:52:17.708 --> 01:52:19.416
It was him or all of us.

01:52:19.416 --> 01:52:21.000
Listen up now.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.625
We can't turn on each other,

01:52:22.625 --> 01:52:26.083
because that's the way this whole
goddamn thing implodes, you hear me?

01:52:27.541 --> 01:52:30.083
Hey, watch your back!
I got him.

01:52:35.083 --> 01:52:36.250
Go around there.

01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:38.958
The suspect is armed! He goes down!

01:52:38.958 --> 01:52:41.958
- He does not get back up!
Chief!

01:52:44.291 --> 01:52:45.625
Light him up!

01:52:51.041 --> 01:52:53.083
Use those sting balls, the round ones.

01:52:55.083 --> 01:52:57.041
Fuck.
Hold your fire!

01:52:57.041 --> 01:53:00.041
Watch his cross flare!

01:53:00.041 --> 01:53:01.458
Go!
Fuck!

01:53:06.083 --> 01:53:08.333
She's in pretty bad shape.
You guys carry Narcan?

01:53:08.333 --> 01:53:11.583
Above the center console.
Most of us got kids.

01:53:11.583 --> 01:53:13.375
Roger that. I'll make a run.

01:53:13.375 --> 01:53:16.291
Listen, you hit those disco lights,
it's gonna activate--

01:53:16.291 --> 01:53:17.500
Dash cam.

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.208
Why? So I can record my own death?

01:53:19.208 --> 01:53:21.166
No. Mine.

01:53:21.166 --> 01:53:23.541
They got pre-event recording.

01:53:23.541 --> 01:53:25.625
You hit the lights, the camera goes live,

01:53:25.625 --> 01:53:28.708
records three minutes
before you hit the switch.

01:53:28.708 --> 01:53:31.583
- Figure you got about two minutes left.
- Shit, maybe you too.

01:53:31.583 --> 01:53:34.750
- Unless you put a finger right up in it.

01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:36.291
Move to flank, he's got--

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:47.375
Incoming!

01:53:55.458 --> 01:53:57.000
Not sure who to shoot at.

01:53:58.125 --> 01:54:00.416
Move up! Hold your fire!
- Then maybe don't shoot.

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:04.000
Barnett, go!

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.541
West, Tyler, get up here!
Hold your fire!

01:54:22.333 --> 01:54:24.833
He's by the truck!
Which truck?

01:54:35.583 --> 01:54:37.500
Move the fuck away from him!

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.791
Do not fire!
Hold your fucking fire!

01:54:43.791 --> 01:54:46.583
Where is he?
Do you see him?

01:54:46.583 --> 01:54:47.791
Call it out!

01:54:48.416 --> 01:54:49.875
Do not fucking fire--

01:54:50.625 --> 01:54:52.250
- Neckbone, motherfucker!

01:55:10.666 --> 01:55:13.375
No shot!

01:55:13.375 --> 01:55:17.208
Are those guys on the road block?
Keep those boys out of this!

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.375
Get some water.

01:55:20.375 --> 01:55:22.833
Can anybody fucking see him?

01:55:27.708 --> 01:55:30.583
He's moving!

01:55:47.083 --> 01:55:48.291
Shit!

01:55:49.583 --> 01:55:51.166
Go after that car!

01:55:52.708 --> 01:55:54.000
Hang on, McBride!

01:55:57.583 --> 01:55:59.875
Hey! That's Evan Marston
back there!

01:56:01.625 --> 01:56:04.458
Keep that pressure up!
I need you to walk me through this!

01:56:10.916 --> 01:56:13.625
Forget the instructions.
Throw 'em out. Just open it up.

01:56:14.208 --> 01:56:16.500
You don't know how to...
You don't gotta prime it.

01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:19.791
Just pick a nostril and deploy it.
One push.

01:56:19.791 --> 01:56:21.375
- That's it.
- That's it?

01:56:21.375 --> 01:56:24.125
That's it, man.
Just give her a couple minutes.

01:56:24.125 --> 01:56:27.291
- Here we go! I'm picking you up!

01:56:32.708 --> 01:56:35.416
I say we let him out.
Take him on the road.

01:56:35.416 --> 01:56:37.000
McBride, hear me?

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.041
- I need you to breathe!
Fuck outta my--

01:56:39.041 --> 01:56:41.166
Go!

01:56:42.333 --> 01:56:43.625
Go! Go! Go!

01:56:45.125 --> 01:56:46.583
Oh, fuck!

01:56:49.541 --> 01:56:51.291
Put some fire on that vehicle!

01:56:51.291 --> 01:56:53.625
We got one of ours inside,
another hangin' off!

01:56:53.625 --> 01:56:57.000
<i>Got a stolen cruiser coming
your way. Take that son of a bitch out.</i>

01:56:59.625 --> 01:57:01.916
<i>Negative, do not take that shot.</i>

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.666
<i>We've got two officers onboard.</i>

01:57:09.208 --> 01:57:10.958
There's glass everywhere.

01:57:18.583 --> 01:57:21.666
<i>He's clear, take out the tires.
Driver's side only.</i>

01:57:21.666 --> 01:57:23.416
- McBride, you good?

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:34.166
On the road! Move! Move!

01:57:35.166 --> 01:57:36.083
Hop in!

01:57:36.083 --> 01:57:39.375
I'll package up Ross for the paramedics.
Be right behind you.

01:57:39.375 --> 01:57:42.625
Call it in wide. We need to be
on record before they are.

01:57:58.333 --> 01:58:01.791
The file. You got the chief
shooting me on camera.

01:58:01.791 --> 01:58:04.166
But the recording needs to survive.

01:58:04.166 --> 01:58:07.250
If you've gotta bail,
the DVR's in the trunk.

01:58:07.958 --> 01:58:09.375
He's not gonna bail.

01:58:09.875 --> 01:58:12.958
<i>They are northbound on 13.</i>
- Oh, they're on us.

01:58:13.458 --> 01:58:17.458
<i>This is 103 confirming we still
have an officer on board that cruiser?</i>

01:58:18.666 --> 01:58:21.291
<i>Negative.
We got three armed suspects.</i>

01:58:21.291 --> 01:58:22.833
How're we on speed?

01:58:23.333 --> 01:58:24.916
<i>Comin' up on your left.</i>

01:58:25.583 --> 01:58:27.416
<i>Copy that, we'll box 'em in.</i>

01:58:27.416 --> 01:58:28.958
Maxed out.

01:58:34.791 --> 01:58:39.041
<i>All right, who's got the ARs?</i>
<i>I got one. 103 has one onboard.</i>

01:58:39.041 --> 01:58:41.833
<i>105, 105,
stand by for a PIT maneuver.</i>

01:58:41.833 --> 01:58:43.458
<i>Are you up for it, Sims?</i>

01:58:44.041 --> 01:58:45.458
I got you, Chief.

01:58:46.041 --> 01:58:48.333
<i>105, let me give you some room.</i>

01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:53.000
- I can pull over.
<i>105, we got your back.</i>

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.416
<i>We are standing by.</i>

01:58:54.416 --> 01:58:55.875
You guys make the call.

01:59:01.583 --> 01:59:04.625
Fuck 'em. Don't save 'em the trouble.

01:59:04.625 --> 01:59:05.791
<i>Execute!</i>

01:59:05.791 --> 01:59:08.791
Roger, Chief.
102, 104. Hang back.

01:59:14.958 --> 01:59:16.000
<i>Take 'em out.</i>

01:59:26.166 --> 01:59:29.250
<i>105, looks like you overshot!</i>

01:59:29.250 --> 01:59:31.166
<i>We got a ticking clock here.</i>

01:59:31.166 --> 01:59:33.166
<i>Give it another go, or I'll do it my--</i>

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.125
<i>Check in, 105. What's your status?</i>

01:59:43.125 --> 01:59:46.166
<i>Gonna need a wrecker.
Otherwise, code four.</i>

01:59:46.166 --> 01:59:47.708
<i>You got the chief?</i>

01:59:47.708 --> 01:59:50.000
<i>Affirmative.
State Police are standing by.</i>

01:59:51.166 --> 01:59:54.000
<i>102, we got a straight shot.
We're 10-59.</i>

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.500
What's a 10-59?

01:59:58.291 --> 01:59:59.833
That's an escort.

02:00:10.708 --> 02:00:13.166
<i>10-4. Give Samaritan
a heads-up on their inbound.</i>

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.541
<i>Affirmative, 102.</i>

02:00:17.541 --> 02:00:20.291
<i>Officer onboard.
State police are two minutes out.</i>

02:00:52.583 --> 02:00:56.083
Medical's on the way, Chief,
but I need to see your hands.

02:00:58.916 --> 02:01:00.916
All right, we got two incoming.

02:01:19.791 --> 02:01:20.791
