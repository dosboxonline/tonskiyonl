10:27.627 --> 10:29.754
You got that, Boot?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.880
Why are you 10-8?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.924
Uh, last shift
before I go on leave.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.051
I know--you should be
hiding under a desk

10:35.051 --> 10:37.804
until it is time to go home,
not out on the street.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.431
- Why?
- The curse of the last shift.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.142
Did nothing I taught you stick?
- Only the rational bits.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.894
You see, Detective Harper feels

10:44.894 --> 10:47.105
that the last shift before
a vacation, a retirement,

10:47.105 --> 10:49.357
a wedding is to be feared.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.693
She's very superstitious.
- I mean, so am I.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.319
I'm riding with you.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.196
Might as well write "collateral
damage" on my forehead.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.364
Why didn't you tell me?

10:56.364 --> 10:57.699
Because unlike
Detective Harper...

10:57.699 --> 10:59.075
[cell phone ringing]
I do not believe

10:59.075 --> 11:00.910
in superstitions or curses.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.080
Today is going to be
smooth sailing.

11:04.080 --> 11:04.998
Hey, Bailey.
What's up?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.916
Uh, we have a huge problem.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.170
That's great.
What's going on?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.462
Well, the wedding planner
came by

11:11.462 --> 11:12.672
to check her lighting setup

11:12.672 --> 11:14.591
and somehow shorted out
the HVAC system.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.635
It's getting hot in here.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.387
And it's supposed to be
even hotter this weekend.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.222
And if we don't have
air conditioning--

11:21.222 --> 11:22.724
Okay, we will. We will.
I can fix that.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.309
- Now?
- N-now?

11:24.309 --> 11:25.560
Uh, yes.
No, yeah.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.020
She probably just tripped
a breaker.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.730
Look, we're about
to go back out on patrol,

11:28.730 --> 11:29.814
and we'll swing by.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.649
Okay, thank you.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.527
Is this a huge mistake,
doing the wedding here?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.863
No.
No, this is gonna be amazing.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.073
Come on, best wedding ever,
I promise.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.366
All right, I got to go.
I love you.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.492
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

11:41.492 --> 11:45.580
No, perfect.
It's gonna be just, uh...

11:45.580 --> 11:47.123
you know, just--
Juarez, let's go.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.251
Do we have to?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.961
I mean, there's plenty
of paperwork we could fill out.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.296
And I'm sure Sergeant Grey

11:53.296 --> 11:54.422
could find us things to do
at the station.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.090
- Thanks.
- Hmm.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.550
Hold your nerve,
Officer Juarez.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.053
That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

You mean, like, in writing?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.446
All I'm saying is,
is take it easy.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.740
It's your first day back,
and you're not 100% yet.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.325
Hell, I'm not even 100%,

12:22.325 --> 12:24.827
and I only had a baby,
not a near-death GSW.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.412
Yes, I will be careful,
I promise.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.830
- Good.
- Yeah.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.750
But the correct response
to my last sentence was,

12:30.750 --> 12:33.086
childbirth is deeply traumatic
to a woman's body

12:33.086 --> 12:34.879
and should never be minimized.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.799
Right.
Got it.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.676
So, uh, how are you feeling?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.719
Mm, 80%.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.137
Sad to leave my baby

12:43.137 --> 12:45.014

for something else.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.432

- Same--

- Yeah, I, um--

12:51.354 --> 12:53.481
I don't sleep well.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.483
Too many nightmares.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.694
But I'm hopeful that'll change
once we, uh,

12:57.694 --> 12:59.404
catch the crew
behind my shooting.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.989
Any fresh leads?
- Not that I know of,

13:00.989 --> 13:02.949
but it's my first day too.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.284
All right,
here's what we know.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.411
The Federal Reserve heist
was a two-pronged attack.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.954
In success,
they would have escaped

13:07.954 --> 13:09.747
with $30 million in cash
in an armored car.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.499
And we never would have known
about the secondary,

13:11.499 --> 13:12.959
much larger digital heist.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.794
While computer forensics
are ongoing,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.338
we've so far discovered
over a hundred million

13:17.338 --> 13:20.466
small-dollar transfers designed
to fly beneath the radar.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.593
Any progress
on identifying the crew

13:22.593 --> 13:24.929
that died at the scene?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.222
- No.
- How can that be?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.765
They were clearly
professional criminals.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.726
No prints or DNA
in any database,

13:29.726 --> 13:32.020
and social media scrub of
their faces turned up nothing.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.312
Our working theory is that

13:33.312 --> 13:35.106
a hacker sophisticated enough
to break through

13:35.106 --> 13:36.482
the Treasury Department
firewalls

13:36.482 --> 13:38.318
could have purged
criminal histories

13:38.318 --> 13:40.278
from law-enforcement databases
prior to the heist.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.613
To sum it up,
this crew orchestrated

13:42.613 --> 13:44.282
a brutal attack on my people

13:44.282 --> 13:46.242
in order to rob
the Federal Reserve,

13:46.242 --> 13:48.244
killed three of their own
to slow us down,

13:48.244 --> 13:50.038
and there's no way
to trace them

13:50.038 --> 13:51.164
or the fortune they stole?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.458
And given how rich
they now are,

13:53.458 --> 13:55.168
they could be anywhere
in the world.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.836
<i>[tense music]</i>

All right, listen up.
This crew attacked our people

killed six innocents.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.510
We won't let them
get away with this.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.931
The only way this ends
is bad guys in handcuffs.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.100
Hey, shouldn't you be
out on patrol?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.643
I'm stealing a few minutes

14:12.643 --> 14:14.270
to study
for the detective's exam.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.022
I've been slammed
with so much OT,

14:16.022 --> 14:17.190
I've fallen way behind.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.193
Hey, can I ride with you today

14:20.193 --> 14:21.861
so you can quiz me
in between calls?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.113
Yeah, sure. But it's not
gonna solve your problem.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.907
I mean, if Lieutenant Primm
really has it out for you,

14:25.907 --> 14:27.158
he's not gonna follow

14:27.158 --> 14:28.701
the normal playbook
with your oral exam.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.536
He's gonna give you
some crazy scenarios,

14:30.536 --> 14:32.789
try and sabotage you.
- That's not fair.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.540
The test should be the same
for everybody.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.375
How the hell am I supposed
to study for wild cards?

14:36.375 --> 14:38.086

but we can spend today

your knowledge base a little.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.257
Okay.
Thank you.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.426
Don't thank me yet.
I'm not gonna make today easy.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.928
I mean, the truth is,
you learn best

14:46.928 --> 14:48.513

a little pissed off.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.515

Or are you just trying

14:50.515 --> 14:52.600
to get me to give you
permission to be an ass?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.310
Well, if that's
your attitude,

14:54.310 --> 14:56.062
you really don't want my help.
- No, I do.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.523
I-I need it.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.109
Or do I?

15:01.109 --> 15:03.152
I don't like that smile.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.487
- That's my smile.
- Mm--

15:04.487 --> 15:06.489

that's on you.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.491

I'm making a terrible mistake?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.289

- I can fix it.

of anxiety inside,

15:26.342 --> 15:28.845

excitement, I think.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.471
Well, not to make it
about me,

15:30.471 --> 15:31.931
