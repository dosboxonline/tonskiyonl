00:58.100 --> 01:00.184
- Peter, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

01:00.269 --> 01:02.770
- I'm wonderful. How are you?
- Good, good.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.522
Is this a night for a party or what?

01:07.067 --> 01:10.069
- We had this huge mix-up...
- Okay, everyone.

01:10.154 --> 01:13.156
- I found his commercial. Come on in.
- Oh, I can't wait to see it.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.825
Oh, he can't weasel out of
this one. We're gonna show it.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.327
It's show time, folks. Let's go.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.871
Hey, quiet!

01:19.997 --> 01:22.331
I came from fairly humble beginnings
from upstate New York.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.666
- And to be honest...
- Nice make-up.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.334
...I’d never even been
on an airplane before.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.212
Not until the Air Force taught me to fly
in 1969.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.716
I ended up doing 28 combat missions
for them.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.469
In 1971 ... Oh, a tough year.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.596
I threw everything I owned
into a charter service.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.890
You look better than those frogs
in that beer commercial.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.683
When we kicked off,
we had a six-seater and one DC-3,

01:40.768 --> 01:42.477
and we would fly anywhere.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.353
We were like the yellow cabs
of the sky.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.939
Ln 1979, we started Endeavor,

01:47.024 --> 01:49.692
and we only flew
to four different cities,

01:49.777 --> 01:53.905
but I think the passengers
picked up on my joy in flying.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.741
And we've grown
to 37 countries worldwide.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.576
We're still pretty small
in the scheme of things.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.996
But then, I never wanted
to be the biggest, just the best.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.416
The most important thing
to me these days: family.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.085
Mine. Yours.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.213
That's the good thing about an airline.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.924
It actually brings families
closer together, among other things.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.550
And that makes me feel good.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.094
1971. Man.

02:17.513 --> 02:21.557
I had the devil in me back then.
But today people change.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.436
Sort of.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.401
- He really didn't want to do it.
- I thought he was great.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.320
- He was good.
- Encore!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.696
Where did he go?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.491
Okay, get it over with,
you pack of freeloaders.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.951
- Put it there. I got big shoulders.
- When's it air?

02:40.077 --> 02:42.954
I was afraid to ask, actually.
No, you're too kind. No, you're too kind.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.206
Actually, I'm contemplating suicide
before it airs.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.166
Oh, yes, of course.
Because he's so shy.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.876
And next month he's doing
the underwear billboard

02:48.961 --> 02:50.253
in Times Square. Ow!

03:27.541 --> 03:29.125
You should have seen
the look on his face.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.960
He couldn't figure out
where I got that information.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.880
- And where did you?
- I took safe-cracking at MIT.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.548
No, the guy couldn't believe it, I swear.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.049
Hey, Sean, you eat something?
You okay?

03:37.134 --> 03:38.217
- Yeah.
- Good.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.511
You know, the guy's a wacko.
I mean, seriously, he's, like... Whoo!

03:40.596 --> 03:41.637
Unbelievable, unbelievable.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.723
What I can't figure out
is how someone expects you to bite

03:43.807 --> 03:45.725
without expecting you to know
everything about his business.

03:45.809 --> 03:50.062
- I agree.
- Yeah. Anyway, David's on the carpet.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.132
All right, time to fold the tent, fellow.
Come on.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.300
- Tom?
- Yeah?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.344
Where did you get the tile
in the kitchen? It's great.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.304
Oh, God, Louisa,
that's a Kate question.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.847
See, I only answer Tom questions

04:24.932 --> 04:27.058
like, you know,
what's wrong with my chain saw?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.976
What's the best time of day
to kill a grizzly bear?

04:29.061 --> 04:30.728
I have a perfect Tom question.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.564
How do you feel about Jackie Brown
filing a civil suit against you

04:33.690 --> 04:35.524
from his prison cell?

04:36.735 --> 04:39.320
Sean, why don't you brush, get ready.
I'll be down in a minute.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.738
David, would you get Bob, please?

04:40.864 --> 04:42.573
- And you are?
- I'm just giving you heads-up

04:42.699 --> 04:44.867
because this Brown guy now says
that he has proof

04:45.035 --> 04:47.411
that you paid him
to head off the machinists' strike.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.956
Well, that's not novel. I mean,
he's been saying that for months.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.084
I know, I know. But now he says he has
proof that you even initiated the bribe.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.044
I'm Sammy Adler from the Daily News.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.671
I just thought if we could
spend a couple seconds...

04:56.755 --> 04:59.674
Oh, Bob Stone,
Sammy Adams from the Daily News.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.883
- Adler.
- Why don't you make sure

05:00.968 --> 05:02.051
- he gets home safe?
- Can we do something

05:02.135 --> 05:03.219
for two seconds?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.471
I hope you had a good time here.
Drive safely.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.099
- We're very civil here.
- Guys, I'm a reporter. All right?

05:08.183 --> 05:09.392
- We know who you are.
- I'm not a stalker, guys.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.018
Listen, your boss is gonna
have to deal with this.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.478
Jackie Brown says he was set up.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.188
I think you gotta find
someone else to talk to.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.439
He's in the clear,
you understand, Sammy?

05:15.565 --> 05:16.816
Listen, if I was...

05:29.121 --> 05:30.997
- I came from humble...
- Cut.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.541
- Sean?
- About four cities, but I...

05:33.625 --> 05:35.418
- Sean?
- But people picked on my...

05:35.502 --> 05:37.420
Oh, I guess he's not here.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.215
So I'll lie down and take a nap
while I wait for him to turn up.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.510
God, this mattress is lumpy.
And damned noisy too.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.888
And it's got hair and... What?
This mattress needs to be tickled!

05:47.973 --> 05:49.390
No laughing. No laughing allowed.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.600
And why are you watching
my goof-ups again?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.769
- What is this bug in the... Sorry.
- Cut.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.312
- That's funny.
- Yeah?

05:55.439 --> 05:58.607
Well, must make you feel good inside
to know your old man can't even talk.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.902
Grobe? A shrinking Grobe?

06:02.446 --> 06:04.030
Was that guy mad at you upstairs?

06:04.781 --> 06:08.909
No. He's not mad. He's curious. Yeah.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.078
It's his job, you know. He's gotta...

06:11.163 --> 06:13.456
It seems like someone's
always mad at you.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.668
- That the way that seems?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:18.837 --> 06:23.174
Well, I guess that...
You're not mad at me, are you?

06:23.467 --> 06:26.469
- No.
- Well, I can fix that.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.931
- A knuckle sandwich before bedtime.
- Stop it! Stop it!

06:31.433 --> 06:33.350
I said get your ass moving!

06:33.477 --> 06:34.977
- Get on the car! Shut the fuck up!
- I ain't do nothing!

06:35.103 --> 06:36.395
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Shut up, Romeo.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.439
Calm down. Joey! Joey!
Take it easy. Take...

06:38.523 --> 06:41.859
- Get him out of here.
- A fucking track star, huh?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.486
- You little faggot.
- Faggot? What?

06:43.612 --> 06:45.071
You're lucky I don't
put one in your back, you fuck!

06:45.155 --> 06:46.447
Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.532
- All right? You all right?
- I'm all right.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.744
Honey, you better work the door.
I think the Mayor wants to leave.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.788
Oh, thank God. You okay?

06:53.872 --> 06:55.331
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.000
Okay, did you brush your teeth?

06:58.502 --> 06:59.710
I brushed them this morning.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.670
No, no, no.
We're gonna brush them now.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.850
45-Adam to Central-K.
207 West 30th Street.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.354
- Two unidentified suspects...
- Hey, hey. What are they, mink?

07:18.855 --> 07:21.190
Yeah, why? You wanna buy one?
Take a walk.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.323
Oh, God. I'm beat.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.577
So where was that guy from?
Daily News?

07:34.162 --> 07:38.207
- Does it make a difference?
- Oh! I'd like to kill those bastards.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.001
When they come after you,
they come after us.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.255
It's freezing.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.801
- Oh, God.
- I'd like to come after the contractor.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.387
- Yeah, well, you gotta find him first.
- Yeah, really.

07:51.513 --> 07:56.100
It's freezing in here.
Oh, that feels good.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.227
Don't let those guys get to you, okay?

07:58.562 --> 08:00.896
- Yeah.
- That's what they want.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.986
I just wanna say

08:07.070 --> 08:09.405
Singing makes me feel so fine

08:09.573 --> 08:12.783
Driving in my truck, man
I'm always on the go

08:13.451 --> 08:16.996
Making my deliveries
from here to Tupelo

08:17.080 --> 08:18.622
Tupelo
LEAD SINGER: But singing bass...

08:18.748 --> 08:20.916
Okay, now I’d like
to introduce to you

08:21.042 --> 08:23.127
the person responsible
for this wonderful event.

08:23.962 --> 08:28.465
A fantastic lady. In fact,
chairlady of the Junior Science Fair,

08:28.717 --> 08:30.634
Mrs. Katherine Mullen.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.304
- All right! Yeah!
- Thank you.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.765
Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.

08:37.225 --> 08:41.270
And welcome to the tenth annual
New York City Junior Science Fair.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.067
We have 54 young inventors
competing today...

08:47.485 --> 08:48.652
- Dad?
- Yeah?

08:48.778 --> 08:49.945
Why can't I enter?

08:50.071 --> 08:52.364
Well, it wouldn't be fair, Sean.
Your mother's a judge here.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.867
And how would that look if you won?

08:54.951 --> 08:57.745
Why don't I enter
under a different name?

08:58.288 --> 09:01.957
- What, you mean, like John Smith?
- No. Like Professor X.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.419
Well, I don't think you'd get
away with that, Professor X.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.004
I mean,
you're too young to have a degree.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.423
You got to be bald,
have an eye patch. You know.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.885
No, better. Professor Von X.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.138
And the third judge, I regret to say,
is myself, Katherine Mullen,

09:16.223 --> 09:19.642
Events Chair for the 125th Anniversary
of Central Park

09:19.809 --> 09:23.312
and former teacher of biology
at Evander Childs High School.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.441
So let the games begin.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.653
Our judges will now
begin circulating.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.821
So all of our inventors should be
with their booths.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.156
Yonkers.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.743
That's gotta be the best project
out here. Don't you think it's gonna win?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.579
- Whoa!
- Oh, look, there's me!

09:41.998 --> 09:44.166
Yeah, the wind is taking it.
Down left rudder.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.168
Remember, we're
going to want all of today's winners

09:49.089 --> 09:51.674
- Good luck, everybody.
- It's not fair, Dad. I worked really hard.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.010
I know. I know you worked really hard,
and you did an amazing job.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.179
But we talked about this before,
didn't we, Sean?

09:57.305 --> 09:58.681
- Yes.
- Okay?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.350
Come on. Lighten up a little.
Enjoy the day.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.519
- Okay.
- Anyone else that has not registered...

10:03.645 --> 10:04.770
- Tom.
- Hey!

10:04.854 --> 10:07.273
...must have their registration cards
in right now.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.441
This is your last chance.

10:13.363 --> 10:17.199
- P.S. 41.
- Okay, P.S. 41. Yeah.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.120
Solar system here?
And this big guy here is what?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.830
- The sun.
- Okay.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.707
And how many planets
do we have around it?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.166
- Nine.
- Nine.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.710
I see Mars.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.338
Okay, folks, we'd like to
thank the Friends of Central Park

10:31.715 --> 10:35.634
and Mayor Barresi
for allowing this event

10:35.719 --> 10:39.013
to take place here
at the beautiful Bethesda Fountain.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.851
- And a special thanks to our...
- Hey, Katie, look at the blimp.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.978
- Me, too.
- Looking forward to it.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.398
...for 10 years strong. Lisa?

10:53.653 --> 10:58.699
Well, folks, there's still a few of those
souvenir science fair T-shirts left.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.169
She's incredible. I mean,
the work she's put into this.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.087
Well, I don't know
where she gets the energy.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.592
- And who is this orange guy over here?
- That's Venus.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.720
That's Venus. Where's Earth?

11:20.055 --> 11:21.680
- Earth is this one.
- There's Earth.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.268
Mr. Vincent Barnes,
we have not received

11:26.394 --> 11:29.605
your class’s registration cards
for Curtis High School...

11:29.731 --> 11:30.856
...for the workshop.

11:30.940 --> 11:35.402
- See Mrs. Moran at the exhibit.
- Excuse me for a minute.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.116
Sean?

11:49.084 --> 11:50.250
Sean?

11:51.336 --> 11:53.670
Brooklyn,
Queens to my left, Bronx,

11:53.755 --> 11:56.215
Manhattan and Staten Island
to my right.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.424
You're it.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.634
We ask you to stay
with your boroughs.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.803
- Teachers, please keep a head count.
- Sean.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.721
What do you think, Kate?

12:03.681 --> 12:04.890
Kate?

12:05.809 --> 12:09.019
- Kate. The score.
- I scored it.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.567
Sean?

12:18.863 --> 12:20.197
Sean?

12:27.122 --> 12:28.372
Sean?

12:48.268 --> 12:52.146
- Cassandra, have you seen Sean?
- No. Kate, are you all right?

12:52.230 --> 12:53.397
Okay.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.028
Sean.

13:01.531 --> 13:06.243
Sean. Sean Mullen,
please come to the judge's stand.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.486
Sean?

13:50.371 --> 13:51.872
Oh, please, God.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.248
He's probably just busting chops,

13:53.333 --> 13:54.875
'cause we wouldn't let him
enter the contest.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.835
Who didn't we call?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.966
- Sean?
- You have e-mail.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.273
- I have your son.
- Oh, Jesus!

14:18.358 --> 14:20.067
I want $2 million in fifties
and hundreds.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.485
Oh, God!

14:21.611 --> 14:23.737
No consecutive serial numbers.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.323
No new bills. No marked bills.

14:26.699 --> 14:31.954
The money will fit into two Samsonite
hard-shell suitcases, model #260.

14:32.080 --> 14:37.167
Do not involve the police or the FBI.
If you do, I will kill him.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.420
Do not inform the media,
or I will kill him.

14:40.505 --> 14:45.217
No tracking devices in the money
or the cases, or I will kill him.

14:46.135 --> 14:50.514
You have 48 hours to get the money.
I will contact you.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.897
Open your mouth.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.149
Open your...
Would you open your mouth now?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.027
Open it. Swallow it.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.698
You little prick.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.456
- What are you doing?
- Why don't you just clean your shirt?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.709
Look, we talked about this.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.627
Oh, yeah. Forgot.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.264
Bitch.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.226
Kate. Kate! Who are you calling?

15:36.311 --> 15:37.436
- He said no police.
- Why did you do that?

15:37.520 --> 15:38.645
He said he'd kill him
if you called the police.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.314
I can have the money
inside three hours.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.523
Why did you leave him?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.275
- Why did you leave him?
- I didn't.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.861
I saw you. You walked away.

15:49.574 --> 15:50.949
All right.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.080
- All right, I'm calling the police.
- Call the FBI.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.457
For Christ's sake,
just let me pay this bastard.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.042
Tom, please, call the FBI.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.003
Kate, the FBI just spent
three months trying to bury us.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.088
Do you think they give
a good goddamn about you or me or...

16:05.173 --> 16:06.381
Tom, they know us.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.551
They know us. Please.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.263
All right.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.643
- Lennon Paints.
- Wait. What? What?

16:17.727 --> 16:19.019
We're the painters.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.438
Yeah, we're going to
the Mullen apartment.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.065
We're just finishing work on the library.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.400
Oh, yes. Yeah. I get this call.
Go ahead. Okay.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.570
Behind you.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.489
Mr. and Mrs. Mullen are waiting for you.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.615
Thank you.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.201
Mr. Mullen, how are you?
Lonnie. Hawkins.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.954
- We got Kimba Welch, Jack Sickler...
- How do you do?

16:38.039 --> 16:40.040
- David Levin, Ron Lambert.
- How do you do?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.208
Find the phone panel.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.376
Fatima, could you
show these gentlemen

16:42.460 --> 16:44.086
everything they want to know?

16:45.338 --> 16:46.755
- Paul.
- Who's sweeping?

16:47.256 --> 16:50.133
- And this is Paul Rhodes.
- How you doing?

16:50.301 --> 16:52.678
This here is as close
as we could get to a look-alike.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.930
- Oh, I see.
- Now, look, Mr. Mullen,

16:55.014 --> 16:58.225
I'm not allowed to advise you on this,
but if you decide to pay the money...

16:58.351 --> 16:59.726
It's here. It's right over here.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.021
- This the money?
- Yeah, $2 million.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.232
Well, Paul here can
make the drop for you.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.650
Sure, sure.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.859
- Tom?
- Yeah, David?

17:08.944 --> 17:10.404
Bob's got some stuff for you right here.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.365
Tom, this is all I could get from the
National Center for Missing Children.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.784
Good, good.
Agent Hawkins, this is David Torres.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.703
- Pleased to meet you.
- What about the electric files?

17:17.787 --> 17:19.454
Where's your phone panel,
Mrs. Mullen?

17:19.914 --> 17:22.540
- I have no idea.
- That's okay. We'll find it.

17:22.625 --> 17:26.670
You know, what I don't understand
is these people,

17:26.753 --> 17:28.171
this he, she, it, whoever

17:29.215 --> 17:31.758
has got enough brains to snatch
my son right from under my nose,

17:31.843 --> 17:33.427
but they only ask me for $2 million.

17:33.511 --> 17:37.681
- Don't they know what I'm worth?
- No, no. He's being smart, okay?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.142
Keeping it nice and simple for you.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.479
Now, he knows you got it. Knows you
won't have a problem coughing it up.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.482
Maybe that's all he needs.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.902
Can I... Can I just...

17:53.322 --> 17:55.991
Look, the reason you're here
and not the police

17:56.534 --> 17:58.744
is that we, my wife and I, we believe

17:58.828 --> 18:00.036
that this might be somehow connected

18:00.163 --> 18:03.331
- with the machinists' union indictments.
- Okay.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.001
So Jackie Brown.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.087
The man was caught on tape
taking a pay-off

18:09.172 --> 18:12.466
during contract negotiations
with another airline, Infinite Air.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.051
It was a sting, okay?
So there he is, dead in the water.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.387
He says to your people,
"Can we do something here?"

18:17.764 --> 18:20.348
And so he offers me up.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.976
Yeah, he said Tom gave him
a quarter of a million dollars

18:23.060 --> 18:24.686
for a sweetheart deal with the union.

18:25.188 --> 18:27.481
Now, I have been
investigated exhaustively.

18:27.565 --> 18:30.901
Me, my company, my family. My family.

18:31.569 --> 18:32.903
We've been dragged through
the tabloid mud,

18:33.029 --> 18:35.822
courtesy of FBI leaks,
and nothing. All right? Nothing.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.991
Now Jackie Brown's in jail
where he belongs, and he's pissed,

18:38.075 --> 18:40.160
and I think he's got some
pretty unsavory associates out there.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.579
Mr. Mullen, obviously we're very aware
of the Jackie Brown situation...

18:42.705 --> 18:44.498
- And?
- We're still working on it.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.500
Jesus Christ, I think you should
pay a little more attention.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.460
We're paying... No.
Can I make a suggestion, Mr. Mullen?

18:48.544 --> 18:49.920
- What? What?
- Now, we are going to

18:50.046 --> 18:53.131
get into all of this in time,
but for now, just hang loose.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.966
Just sit tight so we can get a plan...

18:55.051 --> 18:56.551
Hang loose? Hang loose?
Sit tight? Which one?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.553
Tom, just let him finish.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.223
No, it's okay.
It's okay. No, look, look.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.390
I'm sorry.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.434
If this were my child,
I'd be the same way. Believe me.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.728
It's not a problem at all.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.159
All right, kid, I know
this is hard on you, all right?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.745
But you gotta hang in there.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.086
How many kidnappings have you
worked before?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.796
All together, 33.

19:32.922 --> 19:37.342
Now you take away the custodial,
gang, drug-related, I've worked 10.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.178
Now, that's 10 traditional,
ransom-oriented abductions

19:40.263 --> 19:41.388
in the last five years.

19:41.472 --> 19:45.141
Now, that's a lot. Believe it or not,
this kind of thing is kind of rare.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.687
Well, out of the 10,
how many did you get back?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.605
Got back seven.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.485
Well, the others. What went wrong?

19:57.113 --> 20:00.991
Oh, life. What we call the "X" factor.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.785
What's the "X" factor? What is that?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.745
- Are we set?
- No!

20:05.830 --> 20:07.122
Shit, Jack!

20:08.541 --> 20:10.959
Any demands that come up,
now, you just agree.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.796
Let him know he's in charge. Your only
priority is getting your boy back.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.507
Get your boy back. You follow me?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.593
Now, you've got to give us
some time, Mr. Mullen.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.220
You ask to speak to your son.
Ask for some sign that he's alive.

20:22.305 --> 20:23.680
Any information you can get.

20:23.806 --> 20:26.975
Then tell him he has an allergy,
he has some medical condition.

20:27.101 --> 20:30.687
You want to know what kind of weather
is he in. Is he indoors? Is he outdoors?

20:31.105 --> 20:32.981
- Are we set?
- Go!

20:33.316 --> 20:35.358
- Get your boy back.
- Okay.

20:38.779 --> 20:39.988
Hello?

20:45.161 --> 20:46.536
Cancel it.

20:46.996 --> 20:51.875
We got it. Brenda Chance,
4108 Utopia Parkway.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.713
- That's his secretary.
- Yeah, we know.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.807
Is our son dead?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.728
Don't ever think that.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.877
Open your mouth.
It's all right. It's food.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.884
So, why can't you starve in the desert?

21:46.722 --> 21:48.890
'Cause of all the sandwiches there.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.028
What are you doing?

22:04.073 --> 22:05.448
What the...

22:07.535 --> 22:08.576
Voters on
Manhattan's East Side...

22:08.661 --> 22:09.661
What are you thinking?

22:09.745 --> 22:10.829
...will be headed
to the polls tomorrow...

22:10.913 --> 22:12.122
What the hell is going on?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.374
I was telling the kid a joke.
What's the big deal?

22:14.458 --> 22:16.626
You like this kid?
You wanna get to know him?

22:16.752 --> 22:18.086
Get a little relationship going?

22:18.421 --> 22:20.380
You think that's gonna make
things easier or harder?

22:20.881 --> 22:23.883
- Make what easier, Maris?
- Is he for real?

22:24.051 --> 22:26.052
Yeah, I'm for real, bitch.
Are you for real?

22:26.137 --> 22:28.054
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.723
Why don't you just back off, all right?

22:29.807 --> 22:31.766
You step up, and I'll back off.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.103
Come here.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.440
Listen to me. Look.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.944
With the candy bars and shit...

22:45.281 --> 22:49.117
It's just that you might be making beds
in a burning house.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.246
You understand what I'm saying?

22:53.956 --> 22:56.291
Yeah, but, Clark, man,
the kid's in a cocoon.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.586
And he can't ID anybody.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.964
What the hell
he's supposed to tell them?

23:09.805 --> 23:11.139
Wait a goddamn second, man.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.391
Clark, you never said nothing to me
about killing no kids!

23:13.476 --> 23:15.727
Do you understand
what is going on now?

23:15.811 --> 23:18.897
You do not joke with this kid. You don't
play with him. You don't talk to him.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.732
- Don't talk to my brother, all right?
- He is not your pet.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.816
- This is real.
- You don't gotta

23:21.942 --> 23:23.985
talk to my brother, all right?
You got nothing to say to him.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.653
Who do you think you are?
What do you...

23:25.821 --> 23:27.906
- You think you're running shit here?
- No, I'm not running shit.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.657
- My man is running shit.
- Oh. Your man. Right.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.159
But if I have a problem,
I'm going to address it.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.661
- Yeah, I understand. All right.
- I gotta tell you, boys.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.830
She's scaring the bejeepers out of me.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.667
- And you're fucking drinking again.
- Well, that's okay, though,

23:39.794 --> 23:41.753
see, 'cause I haven't
been drinking with the kid.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.343
I have to tell you something
that I think you should know.

23:49.512 --> 23:50.678
Okay.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.643
I paid him off.

23:57.186 --> 24:01.272
You understand I'm not a priest. I'm not
a psychiatrist. I'm not a lawyer.

24:02.358 --> 24:05.485
Tom, this is not
a protected conversation.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.153
I understand.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.448
See, most guys at the top,
they've acquired their airline.

24:10.991 --> 24:14.035
But not me, no, I built Endeavor
from the ground up.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.664
And it's mine, and no bastard's
taking it away from me.

24:17.957 --> 24:21.334
No union, no government,
no gangster like Jackie Brown.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.212
I initiated the bribe.
I had a business to run.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.631
I had 2,000 employees,
God knows how many customers

24:26.715 --> 24:29.050
and I didn't have time
for a goddamn machinists' strike.

24:30.052 --> 24:35.890
So after what I did,
what I proposed and, and carried out,

24:38.227 --> 24:40.311
he's in jail and I'm not.

24:40.521 --> 24:45.483
Did Jackie Brown take my son?

24:46.610 --> 24:48.069
Do you wanna go ask him?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.898
I've been thinking about you.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.820
- Where's my son?
- What?

25:31.655 --> 25:33.072
Do you think that ending up
in this place

25:33.157 --> 25:35.033
is the worst thing
that can happen to you?

25:37.328 --> 25:40.455
- What are you talking about?
- Where is my son?

25:41.832 --> 25:42.916
Oh.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.044
Somebody nabbed your kid

25:47.588 --> 25:49.756
and you think that it's me.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.509
How?

25:55.804 --> 25:57.972
I don't got no connections.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.767
I don't got no friends.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.810
I got no job.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.688
I got no money.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.942
And you, motherfucker,
are accusing me?

26:09.026 --> 26:10.610
Hey! Hey, get off of him!

26:11.445 --> 26:14.697
I got six of my own kids,
and I would die for every one of them.

26:14.782 --> 26:15.865
Get him out of here!

26:15.950 --> 26:19.202
And I haven't seen them since I got
locked up in here because of you!

26:19.286 --> 26:21.246
- Come on!
- Why aren't you in here? Huh?

26:21.413 --> 26:23.998
You fucking belong in jail!
Who did you bribe?

26:24.166 --> 26:26.834
I ain't done with you, you fuck!
I'll kill you!

26:27.503 --> 26:29.462
Who'd you pay to set me up, you fuck?

26:53.570 --> 26:55.738
Come on. You tell me that
again. Say it again. Come on.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.366
I said that I wasn't
running out this door...

26:58.450 --> 26:59.492
You weren't running?

26:59.576 --> 27:02.245
Damn, man. I said
I wasn't running with him.

27:02.329 --> 27:05.206
I was running away from him
'cause he was, like, chasing me.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.292
Yeah, look me in the eye
and tell me that now.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.043
I was... I was running...

27:09.128 --> 27:11.004
- Yeah, where were you going?
- Got the gat, Jimmy.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.423
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Look at that.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.300
- You ever seen that before?
- Uh-uh.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.010
No? I'm not gonna find
your prints on there?

27:17.094 --> 27:18.219
No.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.971
No? Bag that up.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.019
Jimmy, we got a problem here.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.146
This guy doesn't want to
close his store right now.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.690
Fuck it. Forget about it.
Now, tell me about your buddy.

27:30.858 --> 27:33.401
Oh, man. I don't know.
I never saw him before.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.986
- It was the first time I saw him.
- Here. Feel that.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.573
- Christ, this thing's pumping Kool-Aid.
- Yeah, you got a heart problem, there?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.950
- I was running. I wasn't...
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

27:41.827 --> 27:45.455
Wait. I smell a little bullshit here.
I think he's running a game on me.

27:45.539 --> 27:48.499
- I think he's an LAD.
- You a lying-ass dog?

27:48.584 --> 27:51.627
You got any Frankenberry cereal
with the marshmallows?

27:51.837 --> 27:55.631
- Yo, you get me a lawyer, all right?
- You get your own fucking lawyer.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.471
Yo, man, these cuffs are too tight, man.

28:01.555 --> 28:02.847
That's 'cause they're new.
They'll stretch.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.223
You gotta give them a little time.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.352
Get in the car. You want a pizza?
You want a hot dog?

28:07.436 --> 28:08.603
- What do you want?
- Here you go, Jimmy.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.855
- Thanks.
- Let's go back to the house.

29:24.555 --> 29:28.057
Are you a known scumbag in
this precinct or not? Shake your head.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.644
Go on.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.315
Now, a high-profile kid
got snatched yesterday.

29:36.400 --> 29:41.612
You have no idea who knows
about it, huh? NYPD, FBI. Do you?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.197
Shake your head.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.702
No. So what do you do?

29:47.786 --> 29:52.999
You, a known scumbag, walks into
a grocery store filled with cops

29:53.083 --> 29:54.917
and you ask for a box of kiddie cereal.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.713
I don't know about you, but I think
that makes you a four-star asshole.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.048
What do you think?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.895
What the hell were you
gonna do with the videos? Huh?

30:14.396 --> 30:17.231
The kid's got tape on his eyes,
for Christ's sake.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.317
I thought he could listen to them.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.240
Don't be stupid again.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.543
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.546
I was just dreaming about you.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.673
- Was it good?
- Mmm-mmm.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.802
No. My father was back,

30:48.722 --> 30:50.598
and then he was beating me up again.

30:50.766 --> 30:54.685
And then you were there,
but you didn't do anything.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.729
You were just standing
there and watching.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.608
Yeah, well, you know
that's just a dream.

31:00.776 --> 31:04.195
- I locked his ass up, remember?
- Yeah. I know.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.117
Where you been, man?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.786
I'm going out of my mind here,
you know.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.704
Hey, it's all right.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.874
These guys... These guys are wacko.

31:17.251 --> 31:19.502
They don't listen to me.
They don't respect me.

31:19.836 --> 31:20.878
I don't trust them.

31:20.963 --> 31:22.630
Don't worry about them.
They're afraid of me.

31:22.714 --> 31:26.133
- Why do we need them? Why?
- We can't do this alone.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.136
And the kid. I'm scared shit of this kid.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.138
I think we should just do this now.
Get rid of him.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.307
Get it over with,
'cause he's like a time bomb.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.976
Hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.020
You think you're scared of the kid,
but you...

31:38.105 --> 31:39.897
You know what you're really scared of?

31:41.483 --> 31:43.234
Your own humanity.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.864
Your own decency.

31:50.158 --> 31:53.744
'Cause you're good, and that's okay.
That's all right.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.500
That's what I need from you.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.802
When the time comes, the kid's
my problem, not yours. All right?

32:10.304 --> 32:12.722
Well, you still trust me, don't you?

32:12.806 --> 32:16.267
Yeah? 'Cause you know
I can do this, right?

32:18.395 --> 32:19.645
- Yeah.
- Right?

32:19.730 --> 32:20.813
Yeah.

32:24.526 --> 32:25.693
Good.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.946
'Cause it's time to get paid.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.835
- Is there anything in the reports?
- Yeah.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.713
A lot of stuff we already know.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.382
All the stuff we don't know...

32:49.217 --> 32:51.052
Is the stuff you don't want to know.

32:53.388 --> 32:57.892
You know, you tell yourself...
No, you lie to yourself that

33:00.896 --> 33:03.731
you're doing all this for your family.

33:04.274 --> 33:07.443
Security, money, the future.

33:08.070 --> 33:11.155
All this king of the mountain bullshit.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.782
It's bullshit.

33:14.618 --> 33:19.288
I keep seeing him tied up like that
with those handcuffs

33:23.168 --> 33:24.835
and I can't help him.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.798
I can't help him. I can't...

33:34.137 --> 33:37.181
- It's upstairs.
- Kate, where's Tom? Come on, now.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.058
Let's do this. Come on. Come on.

33:41.103 --> 33:43.562
- Coming in.
- All right, here they come.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.148
Remember the drill. Jack!

33:49.486 --> 33:50.820
Hello?

33:51.655 --> 33:53.364
- Mr. Mullen?
- Yes.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.951
- Are you good to go?
- Am I... Am I what?

33:58.704 --> 34:02.790
Get in the car and drive.
96th Street West. Come alone.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.458
Take the Westside Highway North.

34:04.918 --> 34:08.212
I'm... I don't have the money yet.
Not yet. But I need more time.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.130
- I'll get it. I just...
- Don't fuck with me.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.299
I want to talk to my son.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.051
- Come alone.
- Wait. Hold on.

34:15.219 --> 34:18.514
Sean has asthma. It's very serious.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.764
So, what's the weather like?

34:21.143 --> 34:23.561
Is it rainy? Damp?

34:25.105 --> 34:28.190
ls he in a cellar? On a mountaintop?

34:29.985 --> 34:32.527
Please, don't. My son gets vertigo.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.572
How's the linguist doing
with my accent?

34:35.657 --> 34:36.949
The what? The...

34:37.074 --> 34:38.826
Hey, there's no one here. Just me.

34:41.329 --> 34:45.583
- Are you sure?
- Hey, you think I'm a fucking idiot?

34:46.668 --> 34:49.712
- I want to get this over with.
- Very good.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.965
- Let's keep it that way.
- So how do I get my son back?

34:53.216 --> 34:55.176
- Are you going to pay me?
- Of course I am.

34:57.471 --> 34:58.971
Then it shouldn't be a problem.

35:03.477 --> 35:06.270
- He'll call you.
- He'll... When? Who?

35:06.354 --> 35:07.855
No, you'll call? He'll call me?

35:07.939 --> 35:09.940
- When?
- 96th Street. Come alone.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.987
- Goddamn it!
- Yes. Sweet and pretty.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.698
They jammed us.
Everything's frozen.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.993
Did you get it?
Where did you trace it to?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.204
They crashed the computer.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.210
- Did I pick the right guy or what?
- Yeah.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.337
- Huh? What'd I tell you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.546
We're gonna get it.

35:34.382 --> 35:37.301
- Let's get Paul wired up.
- Whoa, whoa. I'll do it.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.430
I'll do it.

35:43.183 --> 35:44.308
Let me.

35:52.442 --> 35:55.194
- He gonna be all right?
- He's gonna be great.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.363
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.698
He better be.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.953
I got a situation here.
Legally, I can't stop you from doing this.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.539
Understand that this guy...
I don't know where he's coming from,

36:06.623 --> 36:08.249
and I think he's a professional.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.543
Now, if he starts throwing us
curve balls out there,

36:10.627 --> 36:12.044
we are gonna have to improvise,

36:12.128 --> 36:14.672
and we might not
be able to protect you, Mr. Mullen.

36:15.048 --> 36:18.843
I think it would be wiser if you just
let one of our guys make the drop.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.471
- Maybe you shouldn't do it.
- Look, I'm okay. I'm okay, really.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.849
I just want to give him what he expects.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.688
Look.
It's almost over, kid.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.316
I'm gonna get you back
with your parents. Promise.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.443
- When?
- Soon.

36:36.528 --> 36:40.948
When?

36:41.950 --> 36:43.617
There are tracking devices
in the bags.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.370
- Do you have any other questions?
- All right, the car's completely wired.

36:46.454 --> 36:49.290
- Any problems, we'll be right there.
- He said I was to come alone.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.208
All we're doing
is following the money, Tom.

36:51.293 --> 36:52.835
- We'll always be a safe distance away.
- Okay.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.128
Listen. Let me give you a tip.

36:54.838 --> 36:57.298
This here's a business
transaction. All right?

36:57.382 --> 36:59.216
You're a businessman.
He's a businessman.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.719
You think of this as business,
you'll be fine.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.014
All right?

37:12.856 --> 37:14.148
Get him back.

37:34.044 --> 37:39.173
CP to S.O. units. All
units converge on 269 West 125 Street.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.176
500 Unit to CP.
We have a visual on the package.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.851
Yeah?

37:51.519 --> 37:54.063
Okay, listen up.
I'm only gonna say this once.

37:54.189 --> 37:58.067
Get off at 1 25th Street,
go right three blocks

37:58.276 --> 38:00.402
to the Kasarda Rec Center.

38:00.528 --> 38:04.198
- Take the suitcases inside with you.
- Son of a bitch is scrolling us.

38:04.532 --> 38:08.869
In the swimming pool, there's
a locker key down by the drain

38:08.954 --> 38:10.454
in the deep end.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.748
There'll be somebody watching you.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.417
You won't see them, but they'll see you.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.878
I want you to get that key.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.714
I want you fully clothed when you do.

38:20.924 --> 38:25.386
You so much as remove
your wristwatch, your son dies.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.973
When you have the key,
go find the locker.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.559
- You got seven minutes.
- All right, I'll do everything you say.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.561
I just need you to repeat it
so I could be very clear.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.021
Seven minutes.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.815
To do what? To get there?
To jump in the pool?

38:37.899 --> 38:41.819
Goddamn it. Ah, Jesus.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.907
- We got it.
- He what?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.575
Blocked out the trace.
Should we pull it?

38:48.660 --> 38:51.245
No. Run the trace again.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.873
All right, let's start dumping
hackers and phreakers in the profile.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.250
Anybody high tech.

38:56.334 --> 39:00.170
We'll cross-match that with military
background, police background,

39:00.672 --> 39:03.257
security training, hostage negotiations.

39:16.146 --> 39:17.604
- Where's the pool?
- It's over there.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.443
Hands in front of you.
Hands straight out.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.654
Hands to the side. Push.
Hands in front.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.489
Hands up.

39:29.451 --> 39:30.951
Hands in front of you.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.542
Shit! We lost him.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.378
Damn it.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.134
Track all unsubs that exit the building.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.366
You're going
too slow. Get your ass moving.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.453
Now, put on the hat and the overalls.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.664
Take the canvas bags downstairs
to the boiler room.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.833
Use the stairs by the shower.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.836
Put the money into the new bags.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.256
Then leave the building
and find a Monte Carlo.

40:27.217 --> 40:28.884
There's a key taped to the phone.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.513
Leave the phone with the suitcases
and drive to the Holland Tunnel.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.847
We'll be watching you, Tom.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.798
We're getting a reading
on those suitcases. They haven't moved.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.883
Tell the S.O. leader
I want that building cleared.

41:14.722 --> 41:18.058
500 to S.O. units.
We got an eyeball. We got the car.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.685
The car has not moved.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.870
S.O. 15 to CP.
Located the packages. They're empty.

41:38.580 --> 41:40.539
Sir, we've got four vehicles
ID'd in the perimeter,

41:40.623 --> 41:42.249
one with a broken taillight.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.085
Put out a description of those vehicles.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.422
Have all units grid out and locate them.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.061
Pick me up, asshole.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.109
Now what?

42:09.944 --> 42:12.237
So how you holding up?
Did you have a nice swim?

42:12.780 --> 42:14.615
Not bad. How're you doing?

42:15.283 --> 42:18.493
Hey, I'm good. I'm good.
You know, thanks for asking.

42:19.954 --> 42:23.290
- How's Sean?
- Having the time of his life.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.670
Hey, I saw your TV commercial.
It's not bad. It's pretty good.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.506
But let me ask you something.
You got a frequent flyer program?

42:31.633 --> 42:34.760
'Cause if you do,
maybe when this is over,

42:34.844 --> 42:37.304
I might just take an Endeavor flight
the hell out of here.

42:39.599 --> 42:41.350
Why? Why me?

42:41.851 --> 42:43.143
Why you?

42:45.355 --> 42:48.982
'Cause you buy your way out of trouble.

42:49.776 --> 42:53.195
Don't you? I read about you
and that union guy.

42:53.363 --> 42:54.947
You should've gone to jail for that,

42:55.031 --> 42:58.325
but I guess you're
a pretty goddamn good liar, huh?

42:58.993 --> 43:00.994
I saw you on TV, Tom,

43:01.329 --> 43:03.705
telling everybody
how innocent you were.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.541
I looked at your eyes.

43:07.669 --> 43:12.047
You know what?
You're a lying-ass dog, pal.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.676
I know you paid that guy off.

43:16.511 --> 43:18.053
You're a payer.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.555
You did it once.

43:21.474 --> 43:23.183
Now you're gonna do it again.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.868
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:43.496 --> 43:45.747
- Listen, Cub. You want me to do this?
- Jimmy said me.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.333
- Fuck what Jimmy said.
- Look, I know the job, man.

43:56.384 --> 43:57.843
Clark, man.

43:59.178 --> 44:01.513
I ain't giving Jimmy
the money until he cuts the kid loose.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.061
I just ain't gonna do it, man.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.188
What are you... Cub.

44:25.413 --> 44:27.247
You a movie fan, Tom?

44:29.917 --> 44:31.960
Ever see that movie
The Time Machine?

44:32.754 --> 44:33.962
No.

44:34.255 --> 44:37.007
It's the land of the future, right?

44:37.091 --> 44:40.427
There's only two kinds
of people in the world now:

44:40.928 --> 44:44.264
the Morlocks and the Eloi.

44:46.267 --> 44:49.811
- Okay.
- And the Elois, they live above ground.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.647
They wear togas. They're all blond.

44:52.774 --> 44:54.941
They eat grapes and shit like that.

44:55.068 --> 44:57.194
But it's like the Garden of Eden there.

44:57.278 --> 45:02.115
I mean, basically, everybody
just lays around, listens to harp music.

45:02.450 --> 45:05.118
- How do I get my boy back?
- Now, the Morlocks,

45:06.788 --> 45:08.955
they live underground, right?

45:09.082 --> 45:13.960
Big, hairy, ugly suckers
like you wouldn't wish on an ape, right?

45:14.045 --> 45:15.796
They're down there
with all this machinery.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.047
They're doing all the labor.

45:17.131 --> 45:21.968
They're making sure that the Elois
have enough food and togas.

45:22.637 --> 45:23.637
Are you gonna answer me?

45:23.763 --> 45:26.640
Well, this is a great deal
if you're an Eloi, right?

45:26.766 --> 45:29.059
There's only one thing.

45:29.769 --> 45:32.729
Every once in a while,
a Morlock comes up to the surface

45:32.814 --> 45:37.651
and snatches an Eloi,
takes him down there.

45:37.819 --> 45:40.237
All right, I'm done driving 'til
you tell me what I want to know.

45:41.406 --> 45:44.074
The Morlocks,
they don't eat grapes.

45:44.158 --> 45:46.660
They're cannibals. They eat Elois.

45:49.080 --> 45:53.083
So when I think about
The Time Machine,

45:53.167 --> 45:55.168
it kind of reminds me
of New York City, you know?

45:57.839 --> 45:59.965
See, you're an Eloi.

46:00.842 --> 46:03.510
You and all your friends,
walking around like zombies

46:03.636 --> 46:06.513
with no fucking idea of the shit
going on down below.

46:07.807 --> 46:10.183
So does this make me a Morlock?

46:12.645 --> 46:15.355
I don't like to think of myself like...

46:16.023 --> 46:17.691
I guess it does.

46:19.026 --> 46:23.280
And every once in a while,
one of you gets snatched.

46:25.533 --> 46:27.200
I guess that's...

46:43.551 --> 46:44.801
See you.

46:45.887 --> 46:49.598
What a city. See you at the Whitney.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.894
See you at the Four Seasons.

46:55.313 --> 46:58.398
See you at the Met. See you.

46:59.650 --> 47:03.069
See you.

47:06.991 --> 47:09.910
- You on the move again, Tom?
- Yeah.

47:10.828 --> 47:14.581
Okay, here we go.
About a mile up ahead, the road splits.

47:15.082 --> 47:19.044
Take the exit onto Saddle River Road,
go to the stone quarry.

47:19.253 --> 47:21.254
Drive 10 miles an hour.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.173
I'm jumping through
all your goddamn hoops.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.716
How am I gonna get my boy back?

47:24.842 --> 47:28.386
We'll swap. You give me the bags,
I'll give you an address.

47:30.890 --> 47:33.183
Good luck to you, laddie.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.170
Get back in the fucking car!

48:44.463 --> 48:46.506
Now, throw out the keys.

48:48.175 --> 48:50.176
Give me the money, man.

48:50.511 --> 48:53.013
- Give me the address.
- Give me the fucking money, man!

48:53.139 --> 48:54.931
You said you were gonna
give me the address.

48:55.016 --> 48:56.683
What?

48:57.184 --> 48:58.852
Do you want to
see your kid again, man?

48:58.978 --> 49:00.270
Then give me the money!

49:01.689 --> 49:04.691
Goddamn it! Give me that address,
goddamn you!

49:09.447 --> 49:11.197
- Don't be fucking stupid, man!
- This is the FBI.

49:12.033 --> 49:15.118
Drop the gun and step away
from the vehicle.

49:15.244 --> 49:17.120
Put your hands in the air.

49:17.204 --> 49:19.039
- Step away from the vehicle.
- Son of a bitch!

49:19.248 --> 49:23.793
- Mullen, stay back. Get down.
- CP, need some help here.

49:23.878 --> 49:25.837
He's surrounded. We've gone overt.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.507
We have one subject
on the ground operating an ATV.

49:29.592 --> 49:32.510
A white male armed
with a handgun, and he's got...

49:32.595 --> 49:33.970
- We have an eye on him.
- Good.

49:34.722 --> 49:35.805
Who is that?

49:37.558 --> 49:39.934
Come on, Cubby. Come on, Cubby.

49:46.942 --> 49:50.445
Stop, or we'll
shoot. Get off the vehicle and lie down.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.614
You have no way out.

49:55.409 --> 49:58.662
You are surrounded. Give yourself up.

49:58.746 --> 50:00.914
- This is the FBI.
- You've got nowhere to go.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.416
We have agents
on the ground.

50:12.802 --> 50:15.261
This is your last warning.

50:20.976 --> 50:23.061
Surrender yourself now!

50:24.271 --> 50:26.064
This is the FBI.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.817
There is nowhere to go.

50:29.485 --> 50:32.404
Drop the gun. Stop at once.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.579
Move! Move!

50:42.456 --> 50:45.959
SWAT Team Leader to CP.
We have deployed. We're moving in.

50:54.719 --> 50:56.886
Got a green light!
Take him out!

51:00.725 --> 51:02.100
Oh, shit.

51:04.103 --> 51:07.105
SWAT Team Leader to CP.
We have an agent down.

51:07.189 --> 51:08.898
We have a subject down.

51:10.151 --> 51:12.736
Who got shot? Who the hell was shot?

51:29.837 --> 51:32.464
Where is he?
What have you done with him?

51:33.883 --> 51:35.175
What?

51:36.886 --> 51:38.344
Say it. Come on.

51:39.722 --> 51:41.973
- Stand back. Come on. Step back.
- No, no, he...

51:42.057 --> 51:44.684
- He's trying to tell me something.
- Look, back off. Let us stabilize him.

51:44.769 --> 51:45.894
Medic!

51:46.020 --> 51:47.896
He's trying to tell me
where my son is. I'm sure of it.

51:50.024 --> 51:52.525
What are you people do...
I did not authorize this!

51:52.610 --> 51:55.320
- We're here under orders.
- That fucking liar!

51:57.615 --> 51:59.574
Don't let him die.
Jesus Christ, don't let him die.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.284
God, don't let him die.

52:04.413 --> 52:06.206
Come on, man.
Don't give up. Don't give up.

52:06.332 --> 52:07.832
Get the choppers.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.668
Stay with him. Come on.

52:13.255 --> 52:15.215
- Shit!
- What?

52:15.841 --> 52:17.383
Ten-seven, sir.

52:20.554 --> 52:21.930
He's dead.

52:34.902 --> 52:37.529
How am I gonna find Sean now?

52:53.045 --> 52:54.796
You killed my son.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.173
SWAT Team Leader to CP.
We're moving out.

52:57.258 --> 52:59.425
S.O. Leader, you've got it.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.409
Give me
as much as you can.

53:24.493 --> 53:26.911
This guy's got to
be on parole, probation, something.

53:27.288 --> 53:29.247
- Get the name of...
- I told you no cops.

53:29.331 --> 53:30.915
Ah, jeez!

53:33.627 --> 53:34.836
You were supposed to
follow the money!

53:34.962 --> 53:36.546
They were following the money, Tom.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.882
The guy had a gun in your face.
They didn't have a choice.

53:38.966 --> 53:41.050
They thought you were
in direct danger.

53:41.135 --> 53:42.927
What does that mean?
What does "wrong" mean?

53:43.012 --> 53:44.721
I mean, is he dead?
Because if he's dead

53:44.805 --> 53:47.307
just say he's dead.
Don't tell me something went wrong.

53:47.433 --> 53:48.808
Just say my son is dead!

53:48.934 --> 53:51.394
Kate, we are operating
under the assumption that he's alive.

53:51.478 --> 53:53.813
You mean you don't
know! You don't know where he is!

53:53.939 --> 53:55.189
You don't know if he is!

53:55.316 --> 53:58.192
You're the goddamn FBI,
and you don't know shit!

53:58.319 --> 53:59.485
We have every agent... Every agent...

53:59.612 --> 54:00.945
You killed the son of a bitch
and now... What?

54:01.030 --> 54:04.365
- Katie. Katie.
- Get... God!

54:04.450 --> 54:07.327
Go. Go away. Go. Go.

54:09.830 --> 54:12.582
We know that the kidnapper
at the quarry was not alone.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.167
We know that.

54:15.544 --> 54:17.253
We also have a real good idea

54:17.338 --> 54:19.589
about who he was teamed up with.
Now, let me show you something.

54:20.341 --> 54:23.593
The guy at the quarry, Cubby Barnes,
has been in jail twice for burglary.

54:23.677 --> 54:25.511
This is no high-tech mastermind.

54:25.638 --> 54:30.934
This guy right here...
Kate, Tom, you recognize him?

54:35.814 --> 54:37.357
- Do you?
- No.

54:37.483 --> 54:41.444
Okay. Now, this is Clark Barnes,
brother to the subject.

54:41.528 --> 54:45.114
Now, we went back and we found him
in your son's video of the park.

54:45.658 --> 54:48.117
This guy is the brains in the family

54:48.202 --> 54:51.162
and we also know he's a lot higher up
the criminal food chain.

54:51.330 --> 54:52.455
According to the NYPD,

54:52.539 --> 54:55.041
this guy Clark, his brother Cubby,
they're supposed to be inseparable.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.543
Now, I guarantee you, we are gonna
do our homework on this

54:57.628 --> 54:59.629
and we will come up
with another player.

54:59.713 --> 55:01.381
In the meantime, what we gotta do...

55:02.049 --> 55:04.384
Aw, Christ. Not this shit.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.636
- We got a cameraman.
- Jack.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.554
Can we get
some agents out there?

55:12.476 --> 55:13.476
This just in. A breaking story...

55:13.560 --> 55:14.936
Lonnie. It's out.

55:15.020 --> 55:16.062
...from our New York bureau.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.647
State police sources tell us

55:17.731 --> 55:21.567
a man has been shot and killed
in an apparent botched ransom drop.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.737
There's also word that multimillionaire
airline mogul Tom Mullen

55:24.822 --> 55:26.239
has been placed at the scene.

55:26.407 --> 55:28.992
With more on that story,
let's go to Donna Hanover live

55:29.076 --> 55:30.660
in front of Tom Mullen's
New York home.

55:30.744 --> 55:31.911
- Goddamn.
- Donna.

55:32.037 --> 55:34.580
We have no official report yet
on the identity of the victim

55:34.665 --> 55:37.333
or his role in
the Sean Mullen kidnapping.

55:37.418 --> 55:40.420
Hopefully, we'll have more information
for you later in this hour,

55:40.546 --> 55:44.590
but details have been slow to come
from the police and FBI sources.

55:44.675 --> 55:46.592
We'll bring you full
developments tomorrow morning

55:46.719 --> 55:49.012
beginning with
Good Day, New York, and, of course,

55:49.096 --> 55:50.638
as things happen here
at the Mullen apartment building...

55:50.723 --> 55:52.348
- What are you doing?
- ...we'll bring you the information.

55:52.433 --> 55:54.100
- Calling my mother.
- No, man, you can't do that.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.685
- Not from this phone.
- Get the fuck out of here.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.854
Hey, hey, put the phone down.

55:57.938 --> 55:59.856
What's the matter, Jimmy?
You don't want my mother to know

55:59.940 --> 56:01.441
that her son's dead
'cause you fucked up?

56:02.359 --> 56:05.445
- Turn that shit off.
- I mean, that's what happened, isn't it?

56:05.571 --> 56:08.698
I mean, it's not exactly like
this guy just rolled over, is it, Jim?

56:08.782 --> 56:11.284
Just take it easy.
Put the goddamn phone down.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.458
He's a fucking kid.

56:19.752 --> 56:21.294
Oh, shit!

56:23.255 --> 56:25.757
Hey, hey, calm down. Take it easy.

56:25.924 --> 56:29.552
You want me to calm down, huh?
You want me to fucking calm down?

56:29.636 --> 56:32.972
You realize they're looking for me
right now, Jimmy? I'm fingered!

56:33.098 --> 56:35.558
I can't go back to my life! What do you
want me to do? You tell me!

56:35.642 --> 56:36.726
- Shut up.
- You tell me, huh?

56:36.810 --> 56:37.894
You know,
you're not gonna be able to go

56:37.978 --> 56:39.312
to your brother's funeral either, man.

56:39.396 --> 56:42.565
Shut the fuck up!
The kid goes in the ground, Jim.

56:42.649 --> 56:44.734
That's it. That's it. Fuck the money.

56:44.818 --> 56:47.320
- We do the kid, and I'm out of here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

56:47.404 --> 56:50.073
He's right. I mean,
you said you were gonna do it anyhow.

56:50.157 --> 56:51.491
Shut up!

56:52.826 --> 56:54.285
- Where are you going?
- Get out of my fucking...

57:06.340 --> 57:07.840
Take a breath.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.968
Come on, come on. Take a breath.

57:13.847 --> 57:16.682
I brought you in on this
'cause you had brains and balls.

57:18.685 --> 57:19.852
Think.

57:22.606 --> 57:26.025
The kid's gonna die
when we don't need him anymore.

57:27.027 --> 57:29.195
Now, use your fucking head.

57:34.535 --> 57:36.369
Go check on the kid.

57:42.376 --> 57:45.878
It's all right. Go on. Go on.

57:54.221 --> 57:57.223
They kill your brother,
and you wanna walk away?

57:57.683 --> 58:00.184
What the hell does that make you?

58:03.063 --> 58:05.064
This thing is not over.

58:05.524 --> 58:07.692
I swear to you right now.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.069
Now, more than ever

58:12.072 --> 58:15.241
this guy will pay.

58:27.754 --> 58:29.922
Can I have a chocolate bar?

58:37.723 --> 58:39.891
- I know you.
- No, you don't.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.643
Don't look at me! Don't look at me.

58:43.687 --> 58:46.647
Chocolate bar. What,
do you think this isn't happening?

58:46.940 --> 58:48.900
What, you think your dad's gonna
come in and save you?

58:48.984 --> 58:50.860
Is that what you think? Well, he ain't.

58:51.069 --> 58:52.403
Nobody's coming, all right?

58:52.487 --> 58:55.740
You understand that? Nobody's coming
'cause this is it for you.

58:59.286 --> 59:01.078
...surfacing
surrounding the high-profile

59:01.163 --> 59:03.164
kidnapping case
of Tom Mullen's son, Sean.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.208
New York One has
exclusive information about...

59:05.292 --> 59:07.001
You know what
the brothers call this?

59:07.252 --> 59:09.503
This is "more drama," right?

59:09.838 --> 59:15.092
Like, "Shit, man, more drama?
Best stay indoors today."

59:15.552 --> 59:18.387
You ever hear that? "More drama."

59:18.889 --> 59:22.725
More drama. More Dramamine.

59:23.477 --> 59:24.810
Drambuie.

59:26.563 --> 59:29.273
- You all right?
- No, yeah. Yeah, good.

59:30.609 --> 59:31.776
Yeah.

59:37.908 --> 59:40.493
- Kimba, listen to this.
- Lt shouldn't be a problem.

59:40.577 --> 59:41.661
That.

59:41.745 --> 59:43.871
After "It shouldn't be
a problem," what do you hear?

59:44.623 --> 59:46.707
Wait. Play it back again.

59:49.002 --> 59:50.878
It shouldn’t be a problem.

59:50.963 --> 59:53.047
It sounds like some kind of horn.

59:53.131 --> 59:55.633
Yeah, I know it's a horn,
but what... It's like...

59:56.176 --> 59:57.551
It's like there's a horn,
a sort of foghorn.

59:57.636 --> 59:59.178
It's too fast for a ferry.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.600
It shouldn’t be a problem.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.022
In the meantime,
now you give her a big hug from me.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.359
Nah, I don't care. You wake her up.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.987
Nah, don't wake her up. I'm just...

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:19.448
Ah, girl, I am so glad we are not rich.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:23.619
You just gotta thank God
for what you have.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:28.040
I love you, too. I gotta go.
I'm gonna call you back.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:31.294
Okay. Bye-bye. Hey.

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:38.467
Why...

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.143
Why would this guy, these people...
Why would they...

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:54.275
Why would they ever let
my son go no matter what I do?

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.902
I mean, no matter what I do.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.031
I mean, pay, don't pay, comply,
tell him to go fuck himself.

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:01.615
Why would they give him back?

01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:04.201
I mean, he's a witness
any way you cut it.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:08.497
It's all bullshit. It's all just...
Just seven out of 10.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.750
What are you saying?

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.630
All right.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:21.135
Morlock Man gets his money,
I don't think we'll ever see Sean again.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.596
That's if he's still alive to begin with.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.431
- Well, now...
- Tom?

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.141
...are you talking about not paying?

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:30.519
- No. No, we pay him.
- Now, wait a minute. Listen to me.

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:34.398
Morlock Man says the pick-up guy
will give me an address for Sean.

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:36.776
I get there, the guy
sticks a gun in my face.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.902
I said, "You want the money?

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.070
"Now give me the address.
Where's the address?"

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.780
You should have seen his face.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:45.159
He had no, absolutely no idea
what I was talking about. None.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:46.285
Okay.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:49.163
This is not business to him.
This is very personal.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.750
I tell you that everybody pays,
and we get back seven out of 10.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:54.543
If we give him what he wants,
he will kill Sean.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.337
Tom, you gotta play the odds, man.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.715
I've been doing this for 18 years.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.008
And if I were a betting man,

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:04.512
I would bet on the people
who pay every time out of the gate.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.225
Did you bet on the ones
where you got back a corpse?

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:18.651
Kate.

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:24.698
If you want to see your child again,

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.327
you gotta help me with him.

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:32.623
- Stations!
- Mark it.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:37.753
Mullen.

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:40.548
You think you can run a game on me
and fuck me out of my money?

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.299
No, I...

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.971
It was out of my control.
I did exactly what you said.

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.347
You did?

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:52.768
This is how you want to play it, huh?
You're gonna bullshit me, Tom?

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:54.770
Who do you think you're dealing with?

01:02:54.855 --> 01:02:57.940
They told you they were
just gonna follow the cash, right? Huh?

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.276
Who's the asshole
you're listening to over there?

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.654
Is he a fed? I said no cops.

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:05.948
No FBI. You pay me.
It shouldn't be a problem.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.992
Now we got a fucking circus out there.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.453
All right. Just say what you want to say.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.746
- The money.
- I want to talk to my son.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:16.000
Take the FDR Drive down
to the Williamsburg Bridge exit.

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:19.712
- No. I know he's dead.
- You don't know shit.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.173
Take FDR Drive
down to the Williamsburg Bridge...

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.507
My son is dead. Go to hell!

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:26.552
What did you do?
Tom, what did you do?

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:30.764
Oh, God. Please, God. Please, God.
Please, God. Please. Please, God.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:41.817
Mullen.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.612
- Dad?
- Sean?

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:47.531
Williamsburg Bridge.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:51.160
And you assholes listening in,
if I smell you clowns within 10 miles

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.496
of that money, I'll gut this kid like a fish.

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.561
Give me Mr. Wallace.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.857
I'm going alone.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.485
Is that understood?

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.279
No helicopters, no wires. Just me.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.874
- You got the phone?
- Yeah, I got the phone.

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:42.836
You gonna be all right?

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.298
- Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.
- Okay.

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:17.246
Mr. Mullen... It's not Mullen.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:22.835
Let's go. That's him.

01:05:50.405 --> 01:05:53.198
- Hey, John, keep shooting.
- Man, this is fucking great.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.162
Hey!

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:01.832
Come on!

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.543
Endeavor Airline CEO
Tom Mullen and his family

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:49.171
are no strangers to the public eye.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:51.715
As head of the country's
fourth largest airline,

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.093
Tom Mullen, whose personal stake
in the company

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:55.886
was reported earlier this year...

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:02.351
But nothing in his triumphant,
high-profile life

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:05.604
could prepare Mullen for the drama
presently unfolding around him:

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:09.775
the taking of his nine-year-old son
by unidentified kidnappers.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.699
- Where are you at now?
- I don't know.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.245
Head up to Houston and Broadway.

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.750
But for now, the city
and the country anxiously await word...

01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:28.127
You hear me?

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:32.214
Mullen?

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:39.304
- Change of plan.
- What?

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:42.808
Turn on your TV.
Channel 5. Keep watching.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.269
Lt shouldn't be more
than an hour or two.

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.275
You understand what I'm telling you?

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.694
Mullen, what the fuck...

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:15.132
It's mine. Hello?

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:19.970
David, I need you
to contact Don Campbell at WNYW.

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:25.184
- All right.
- Good.

01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:30.981
- Bob, can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:35.486
David.

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:40.073
- All right, here we go.
- Okay, they're ready.

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:54.462
Pull out of it.
All right, everyone. Look alive.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.591
Mr. Mullen, we're gonna get you
set up right over here.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.301
We'll get you wired up with a mic.

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:04.515
I will signal to you
from next to the camera.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:10.270
Ready to go? On five, four, three, two...

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.273
Good afternoon.
We are interrupting this program

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:15.776
to bring you an exclusive report.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:18.529
As you know, we've been following
the Mullen kidnapping

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:19.988
for about a day or so.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.573
We will get back
to our regular program,

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.408
but right now we're going to
show you something

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.577
that you will only see right here.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:28.080
Tom Mullen, Sean Mullen's father.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.413
Mr. Mullen?

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:36.755
Tom, you're on.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:41.844
The whole world now knows

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:46.430
my son, Sean Mullen, was kidnapped
for ransom three days ago.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.225
This is a recent photograph of him.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.104
Sean, if you're watching, we love you.

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:55.274
And this...

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.110
Well, this is what waits
for the man that took him.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:00.529
This is your ransom.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.614
Wait. I want to see this.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.701
Two million dollars
in unmarked bills, just like you wanted.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.745
But this is as close
as you'll ever get to it.

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:11.957
You'll never see one dollar
of this money

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.961
because no ransom will ever
be paid for my son.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.298
Not one dime. Not one penny.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.927
Instead, I'm offering this money
as a reward on your head.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.306
Dead or alive. It doesn't matter.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:32.227
So congratulations. You've just
become a $2 million lottery ticket.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.479
Except the odds
are much, much better.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.567
Do you know anyone that wouldn’t
turn you in for $2 million?

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.778
I don't think you do. I doubt it.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:44.406
So wherever you go
and whatever you do,

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:46.450
this money will be
tracking you down for all time.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:50.162
And to ensure that it does,
to keep interest alive,

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:51.997
I'm running a full-page ad

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.002
for as long as it takes.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:11:01.340
But, and this is your last chance,

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:05.177
if you return my son alive, uninjured,

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:07.095
I'll withdraw the bounty.

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.681
With any luck,
you can simply disappear.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:16.521
Understand you will never see
this money. Not one dollar.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.275
So you still have a chance
to do the right thing.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.364
If you don't, well, then God be with you

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.115
because nobody else
on this Earth will be.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.117
Well, he's got nerve.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.373
That's it.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.919
Well, there you have
it, Rosanna. A shocking turn of events.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.922
The ransom has turned
into a $2-million bounty.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:44.299
Tony, it's obviously
a very dangerous situation.

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:47.052
Anything could happen. Of course,
we wish him the best of luck.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:51.890
Did you notice he described the
kidnapper as a $2 million lottery ticket?

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:54.893
- The stakes are high on this one.
- Yeah, as you mentioned also...

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.400
Could you turn it off?
Could you turn it off?

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.567
Mr. Mullen
also appealed to his son.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.903
He said, "Sean, if you're
out there listening, I love you."

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.864
- It was very heartbreaking.
- Also, our producer is telling me...

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:12.244
- Yeah.
- Mullen, you're a fool!

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:14.746
Stupid ass!

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.876
I'm proud of you!

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.007
A pair of armed
bandits held them up last night.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:27.592
Police say a
pair of gun-toting crooks went

01:12:27.719 --> 01:12:29.261
into the Korean church
at Murray Street

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:31.680
in Flushing last night
and announced a robbery.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:34.391
- They took wallets, handbags...
- Hey, where'd they take the kid?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.893
You know. The place we said.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.567
I had to do this.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.569
You had to do this?

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:50.240
You had to do this?

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.869
Kate, please.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:59.374
I'm so scared, but I know if
I give him the money, he'll kill Sean.

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:01.960
- I would if I was him.
- What did you just say?

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.462
Just look at it from his point of view.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:06.923
You think you're smart.
You've got everybody off balance.

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:09.634
- You think you got it all figured out.
- You trying to screw me?

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.636
And then suddenly, out of left field,

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.638
the one thing you thought
would never happen does.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.640
- We gotta end this...
- What are you doing?

01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:18.477
No ransom, no money, no profit.
Nothing. Nothing but downside.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.312
Because you've got this boy's father...

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.482
He's coming on like a stark,
raving mad lunatic.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:27.569
- You turned her around, didn't you?
- I mean, the guy can piss $2 million,

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:28.820
- but he's willing to risk everything...
- Don't!

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.072
...just to fuck you up.

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:32.991
How can you negotiate with
a lunatic like that, huh? You can't.

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:36.161
- Now you're off balance.
- Get down. Lay down!

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:39.498
You wanna stay down there forever,
maggot? Did I get my money?

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:40.999
Pretty soon you realize if you don't

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:43.085
return this kid in mint condition
as soon as possible,

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.504
you're gonna be the most hunted man
on the face of the Earth.

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:50.175
And this maniac will never,
ever quit until he's got you.

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:52.469
Nobody pulls out on me.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.013
You know me.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.975
This is my show. I say when it's over.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.435
- Take it back.
- No.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.603
Tell him that you were wrong.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:02.854
- Kate, no, I can't.
- Take it back.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.106
No, Kate, there is no other way. None.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:05.607
He's my son too,
and I want you to pay him.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.192
Kate. They will kill him.

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:09.778
Please, all we have is each other.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.865
Do you think any of them...
Do you think they give... It's just us.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.868
Do you think I don't
want him back? Is that it?

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:18.120
You think I wouldn't do absolutely

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:19.621
everything in my power
to get him back?

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:23.041
I'd cut my arm off.
I'd... I want him back so bad.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:27.838
Katie, please. I don't think
I can take this if you're not with me.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.438
Don't quit on me.

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:59.786
Tom. Now...

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.084
I think what you did was wrong.

01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:09.087
You put your son at greater risk.

01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:12.841
Now, I need you
to withdraw that reward.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.885
Just pay this bastard.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:18.930
Now, I believe that
you will get your son back.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:23.768
And when we do,
we will nail this son of a bitch.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:28.106
Now, God forbid you don't...

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.150
Your son...

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:34.070
I swear to you
I will work on nothing else.

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:36.448
If I have to, I will take
a leave of absence from the FBI

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:39.326
and you can hire me as
your personal security consultant.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:42.621
And I will work on this
as long as I am physically able.

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.372
- Lonnie, please. I...
- Tom.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:47.125
I never told anybody, any of my people

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:51.838
about you and Jackie Brown, the real
truth of it, and maybe I never will.

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:57.010
You think I'm worried
about going to jail?

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:05.727
Mayor Barresi today voiced his
disapproval of Tom Mullen's decision.

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.729
Donna Hanover joins us
later in the broadcast.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:09.814
- You care for an update?
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.985
Well, in the last two hours
since your husband's TV thing,

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:16.071
we've had 4,000 calls.

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:18.823
And you know how many real,
good, solid leads?

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:20.492
How many?

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.828
Zero. And every time one of these

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:27.207
greedy little whack jobs calls,

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:31.378
that is one less agent
looking for your child.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:33.880
Now, I gotta tell you, Kate.

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:39.135
I have never been confronted with such
an unbelievable act of sabotage

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:41.304
by a parent toward
the recovery of their child,

01:16:41.389 --> 01:16:43.682
as what your husband
pulled off here today.

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:46.268
It is all on you now

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.979
to talk to your husband,
get him to withdraw this money.

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.856
- Otherwise we are in deep trouble.
- Withdraw the... What if he's right?

01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:55.193
What if they have no intention
of returning Sean at all?

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.489
- I trust him.
- You trust him?

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.825
Yeah. I believe in him.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:04.703
I stick with Tom,

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.415
and we always manage
to land on high ground.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.209
High ground?

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:17.340
Like with the Jackie Brown situation?

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:20.719
Yeah.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.393
What exactly did your husband tell you

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:31.896
about Jackie Brown?

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.282
- David?
- Yeah.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.950
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.579
Look, Hawkins said that
if I can come up with the $2 million,

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.205
that he'd work it
so that I can make the drop.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.623
- Come on, Kate...
- Now, all I can raise

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:51.958
is about a half a million.

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:54.461
I know you have access
to a discretionary fund.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.629
Kate. Jesus, please. Listen,
you should talk to Tom about this.

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:59.257
- This isn't about Tom. This is Sean.
- Really.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:02.594
I'm doing okay.
I'm holding up all right.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.597
Kate, I can't do it. All right? I...

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:11.311
He told you not to give me
any money, didn't he?

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:14.439
Kate, he's my boss. Okay?

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.459
Eat this.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.463
Thank you.

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:51.684
Again, I say if it were my kid,
I would pay.

01:18:51.811 --> 01:18:54.396
I like the idea, "Yeah, you want
the money, come and get it."

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.605
And when he comes and gets it, I hope

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:57.232
somebody cuts their heads off,
you know?

01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:01.653
I'd get my boys from the Bronx,
and we'd just totally...

01:19:02.113 --> 01:19:04.114
- Take care of him.
- We'd mess him up big time.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.616
I think
he's risking his son's life.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.744
I think he's a fool.
His child’s life is in danger.

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:11.579
Pay the money. Get on with your life.

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:15.208
I'd beg, borrow and steal,
if I had to. He should pay.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.127
What?

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.547
A man calls me at my home today.

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:23.550
He ask me to look in my mailbox.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:27.470
He told me to give you this,
and nobody else.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:30.140
He said if the police
know anything about this,

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:34.519
if Mr. Mullen knows about this,

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.022
they'll kill Sean.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:40.024
Okay.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:57.208
Who is it?

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:42.629
Oh, God!

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.925
It's very simple.

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:50.595
I'm growing very, very tired
of his bullshit.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:54.182
- Then could you...
- Now it's up to you.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.520
Get him to take back the reward
and pay me my money,

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:02.148
or you're gonna find pieces
of your little boy all over New York.

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:05.109
I'm not gonna waste a bullet.

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:08.780
I'm just gonna sharpen my knife.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.369
Oh, God! Please!

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.636
And he never raised
his voice at all, Kate?

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:34.430
No, he...
No, he was whispering.

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:37.308
I... He was whispering.

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:40.979
Okay. Come on. We'll take it to the lab.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:46.985
You paid off to save your airline.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.906
Why won't you pay off
to save your son?

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:07.880
I'm not a marriage counselor.
I'm here to get your boy back.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.237
I'm sorry.

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:34.699
I hope

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:37.869
that you can forgive me for that.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:44.042
And for what I have to do now.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:48.713
Get the shirt to Forensics.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.840
Make sure they check
for more than one blood type.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.050
Sure, Lonnie.

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:55.887
Where are you going, Tom?
Where are you going? What you...

01:22:57.765 --> 01:23:01.142
I'm not... All right.
Just think before you act.

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.024
- There he is.
- Mr. Mullen!

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.567
Mr. Mullen!

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:24.624
- I’d like to make a statement.
- Quiet.

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:30.088
And that is that I’m undeterred
in my course of action.

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.593
And I'm raising the reward.

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:39.347
I’m raising it by $2 million.

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:41.849
Mr. Mullen,
why are you doing this?

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.643
I want my son back.

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:47.105
Thank you. Thank you.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:50.274
The FBI's
efforts in this area...

01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:58.658
This just in,

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.994
Tom Mullen has reportedly raised
the reward money for his son's life

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:04.288
by $2 million.

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:23.641
Hey.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.145
Where are you going?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.657
You've ruined my life.

01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:43.953
Who the hell you think
I'm doing this for?

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:46.247
A stunning development tonight

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.583
as Tom Mullen
doubles the reward money

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:51.502
to $4 million for the capture of...

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:57.341
- What?
- Wanna talk to your son?

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:01.929
- Yes, of course I do.
- Daddy? Dad?

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:03.723
Sean.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:07.185
- Sean. Sean. Son.
- Sean? I wanna listen.

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.187
That's enough.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:11.022
No, put him back on.
I wanna talk to him.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:12.523
You just did.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:17.570
Now, you listen real, real good.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:21.407
You got one more chance to pay up

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.034
or you're never gonna talk
to him again.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.535
No more fucking around.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.205
This is it right now.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.373
What's it gonna be?

01:25:36.215 --> 01:25:40.009
No. Bullshit. You're not gonna
touch him. You can't be that stupid.

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:42.428
Do you have any idea
the rain of shit I can put on you?

01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:43.930
Look at your wife.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:47.266
Look at her face, motherfucker. Do you
know what I can do to your boy?

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.936
Is it dark where you're calling from?
You got the shades drawn?

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:53.439
Kind of like a cellar, right? Like a
cave? Well, you better get used to that.

01:25:53.524 --> 01:25:56.025
You better get used to crawling
in the dark for the rest of your days

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:59.403
because I am going to get the best
group of manhunters in this country

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:01.614
and I am gonna dedicate my life
to tracking you down!

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:03.908
- You understand?
- Hey, get your head out of your ass!

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.159
You think you can threaten me, huh?

01:26:05.244 --> 01:26:07.161
Who do you think you're dealing with?
Give me the money!

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:08.663
Fuck you and your $2 million!

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:11.290
Don't you understand English,
you useless piece of shit?

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:12.500
No money! None!

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:15.002
Let me tell you something. You think
you're suffering right now? Huh?

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:16.587
You got no idea what suffering is.

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:19.882
If I don't get the cash in one hour,
this kid is dead!

01:26:19.967 --> 01:26:23.970
I don't get my son back, and I mean
real soon, you better kill yourself

01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:27.139
because when I catch up with you
I'm gonna take my goddamn time!

01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:29.684
By the time we're finished,
you're gonna wish you weren't born!

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:32.103
I'll have your head on a fucking pike!
You understand me?

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:34.272
Fuck you! I'll fucking kill him right now!

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:35.731
- I wanna talk!
- You kill him,

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.692
you kill yourself, you motherfucker!

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.194
- Give me back my son!
- Hello!

01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:41.362
- You want him?
- Yes!

01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:42.738
You want him?

01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:43.823
Daddy!

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.617
Oh! Jesus! Jesus!

01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:49.745
Oh, Jesus!

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:54.000
Oh, God!

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:00.882
I'll fucking kill you, Mullen!

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:14.478
You son of a bitch! You killed him,
you son of a bitch! Goddamn it!

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:15.938
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Come on.

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:17.899
- Easy. Come on.
- Kate!

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:21.611
- Both of you listen to me!
- You killed him! Not them! You!

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:24.238
No, Kate! Kate.
Okay, it's all right.

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:27.116
- Take her in the other room.
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.744
- Oh, God. I wanted to talk to him.
- I know.

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:32.038
- I wanted to talk to him.
- You'll talk to him, honey.

01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:33.915
You will. You will.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:42.298
- What do we do about this kid?
- Ain't my problem anymore.

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.216
Can't ID anybody, right? Fuck him.

01:28:19.086 --> 01:28:21.170
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:24.590
Oh, please, help me. Please.

01:28:24.675 --> 01:28:27.885
Okay, Katie, all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:30.179
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.420
Oh, Tom.

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:29.215
South 44 to Base.

01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:32.843
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- South 44, go.

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:37.389
26271 8th Street. 1 0-13.
Officer needs assistance.

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.601
I have several armed men in a house.
Possible kidnap situation.

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:43.020
Repeat, possible kidnap situation.

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:46.023
1 0-13. Officer in civilian clothes.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.881
- Police!
- Shit.

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:17.388
- Get the fuck out of the van!
- Go, man. Come on.

01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:38.367
Drop the gun!

01:33:13.046 --> 01:33:15.589
Move! Move! Go!

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:22.429
Clear!

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:24.598
Clear!

01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:26.725
Police! Freeze!

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:29.186
Whoa! I'm a cop!

01:33:29.271 --> 01:33:31.188
- Clear!
- Hold your fire. I'm a cop.

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:32.940
He's all right.

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:36.402
I'm a cop.

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:44.410
Kate. Tom.

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:53.919
FBI. Coming through. Coming through.

01:33:54.045 --> 01:33:56.922
Stay with me. Stay with me. Coming
through, fellows. Coming through.

01:34:01.428 --> 01:34:03.512
Where is... Where is...

01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:07.349
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:10.519
Where is... Lonnie? Where's Sean?

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:12.479
In the house. In the house.
Right over here.

01:34:13.398 --> 01:34:16.108
Don't stop here, guys.
Keep moving all the way through.

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:18.736
- Clear the doorway here, okay?
- The boy's in there.

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:19.945
All right, here comes the boy's father.

01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:22.239
Sean? Sean? I'm... I'm the father.

01:34:22.324 --> 01:34:23.490
Sean?

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:28.120
- Who is it?
- Sean. It's me. It's Daddy.

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:29.705
Daddy?

01:34:31.374 --> 01:34:34.418
Is he... Is he all right?
Can I pick him up? Can I hold him?

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:35.794
- Oh, he's gonna be all right.
- Oh, Sean.

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:38.422
He's just got a nasty cut on his hand,
and he's a little dehydrated.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.257
- Sean, it's Mommy.
- You're okay, buddy.

01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:42.134
You're okay. We got you.
We got you now.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:43.469
Hi, Mom.

01:34:43.553 --> 01:34:46.138
- Hi, sweetheart.
- You're okay.

01:34:47.474 --> 01:34:50.100
- Take me home, okay?
- Oh, sure. Sure.

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:53.687
- Take me home.
- Okay, honey.

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:58.192
- I love you, Sean.
- Me, too.

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:08.452
Mama's here, Sean.

01:35:11.498 --> 01:35:12.956
You're okay.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.009
- Is he seriously injured?
- Here's your man. He's right over there.

01:35:24.094 --> 01:35:26.595
He's gonna be okay.
Step to the side, please.

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:27.846
- All the way to the right.
- Lieutenant, we...

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.890
- All the way back. Get back.
- Back off.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:32.935
- Mr. Shaker?
- Step back, please.

01:35:33.019 --> 01:35:34.019
Step back. Step back.

01:35:34.104 --> 01:35:35.229
Did you get
a chance to talk to him?

01:35:35.313 --> 01:35:37.398
- I said step back.
- Thank you.

01:35:37.524 --> 01:35:39.608
Call the justice.
It's a department courtesy.

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:47.032
- All right, now, if you please.
- Move. Move.

01:35:47.117 --> 01:35:49.284
- Guys, help us out, will you?
- Thank you.

01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:55.833
Tom. Tom? Just come this way.

01:35:57.335 --> 01:35:59.586
What...
What... Mr. Mullen!

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:03.090
You know her?

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:05.926
Yeah.

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:08.512
I do.

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:13.767
Jesus Christ.
I mean, she worked for me.

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:15.185
Catering.

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:20.482
Please, sir! Here!

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:25.028
- Mr. Mullen! Tom! Tom!
- Mr. Mullen, this way!

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:26.196
Mr. Mullen, this way!

01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:28.198
Wait! This way!
Right here! Right here!

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:30.367
Look over here, please!

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.871
- You okay?
- Not now. Come on, back off.

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:36.165
Not now. Leave them alone.

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:39.460
- Give us a break now!
- Sean, here!

01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:41.879
- Sean! Mr. Mullen!
- Mr. Mullen, this way!

01:36:41.963 --> 01:36:43.464
Mr. Mullen, please!

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:46.008
Turn the lights on!
Turn the lights on!

01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:48.635
It's all right.

01:36:49.345 --> 01:36:50.554
I'm afraid of the dark.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.347
- I don't like the dark.
- You're all right.

01:36:52.432 --> 01:36:54.224
- Leave the light on.
- Yeah, we'll leave them on.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:57.394
We'll leave them on all the time. Okay?

01:36:58.855 --> 01:37:03.108
Next thing I know,
one guy starts blasting away at me.

01:37:03.193 --> 01:37:06.862
The... The other guy,
he goes to run me over.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:11.074
So, you know,
I just did what I had to do.

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:13.619
What about the woman?

01:37:16.498 --> 01:37:17.706
Jimmy?

01:37:21.586 --> 01:37:24.505
You know, I just
got spun around by the bullet.

01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:27.382
I didn't know it was a woman till after.

01:37:33.973 --> 01:37:35.390
He's an honest cop.

01:37:35.475 --> 01:37:37.476
- He does a hell of a job.
- No, just one.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.644
He's kind of a to-himself type of a guy.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:39.853
- Cancel the other one.
- But I tell you what,

01:37:39.938 --> 01:37:41.855
when the chips are down
this is the one I’d want with me.

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:44.066
- How do I feel?
- No.

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:45.359
I'll tell you, this is the second time

01:37:45.443 --> 01:37:46.610
- Jimmy Shaker's been shot.
- Just one-way.

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:49.863
He got clipped once before in 1992,
and this guy keeps coming back.

01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:52.824
Yeah. Mr. Kinney. Yeah. Thanks.

01:37:52.909 --> 01:37:54.034
Continuing our coverage

01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:55.285
of the Mullen kidnapping case,

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:58.080
questions still surround Maris Connor.

01:37:58.665 --> 01:38:00.332
With no prior criminal record,

01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:03.085
authorities are interrogating
family and friends,

01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:05.337
seeking any associations
that would connect her

01:38:05.421 --> 01:38:07.464
to the other slain suspects.

01:38:07.549 --> 01:38:10.717
Sources reveal today that
the investigation continues

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:14.096
and the search for other suspects
is by no means over.

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:16.139
Many investigators
believe that, indeed,

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:17.891
the mastermind
of the Mullen kidnapping

01:38:17.976 --> 01:38:19.726
may still be at large.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.607
We can make it.

01:38:26.651 --> 01:38:29.152
- You cold, honey?
- Yeah. My hands.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.654
- Do you wanna go home?
- I didn't bring my gloves.

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:32.155
- No. No. No.
- You sure?

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.283
Hey, you're squinting a little.
Is the sun still bothering you?

01:38:34.367 --> 01:38:35.701
- Put these on.
- Yeah.

01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:38.579
- I'll go get your gloves.
- Okay.

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:41.248
You'd better practice. I'll be back.

01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:46.253
Look at me.
You look good in those, honey.

01:38:46.462 --> 01:38:47.963
Look at my glasses. Can you see?

01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:50.215
Look like your daddy in those.

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:53.552
Well, David, it's a little hard
to focus right now. Can it wait?

01:38:54.679 --> 01:38:58.098
No? Well, the hell with it, then.
Let him have it. Let it go.

01:38:58.391 --> 01:39:01.852
Yeah. Listen, I got Sean waiting for me
in the park, so maybe we...

01:39:02.103 --> 01:39:03.186
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:05.689
Hey. I'll call you back, David.
Call you back.

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:08.650
Mr. Mullen.
The doorman just called up.

01:39:08.735 --> 01:39:10.277
- Mr. Shaker wants to see you.
- Yeah, yeah,

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:11.653
I'm sorry to show up like this.

01:39:11.738 --> 01:39:13.864
Oh, hell, no. Come in.
I wanna talk to you.

01:39:13.948 --> 01:39:15.324
- Thanks.
- Come in. Come in.

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:16.867
How's the shoulder?

01:39:18.036 --> 01:39:19.202
You know. I'll live.

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:21.913
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised
to see you up and about so quick.

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:24.499
- Fatima, this is Jimmy Shaker.
- Hi.

01:39:24.584 --> 01:39:26.335
I'm very proud to meet you.

01:39:27.253 --> 01:39:29.087
- Very proud.
- Thanks.

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:34.384
How's the kid doing?

01:39:34.469 --> 01:39:37.262
Oh, he's fine, you know,
all things considered.

01:39:37.347 --> 01:39:39.723
- It'll take a while.
- Yeah.

01:39:42.268 --> 01:39:45.228
Forgive me. I thought
we were gonna meet on Monday.

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:46.647
Maybe I screwed up. I don't... I...

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:50.233
Yeah, you're right.
Monday. We... That's what we said...

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:53.487
See the special officer holding 4-5-9...

01:39:56.074 --> 01:39:59.785
Look, I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me here,

01:39:59.869 --> 01:40:03.163
but I was hoping
we could do this today.

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:05.791
- You know, the reward and all?
- Oh. Of course.

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:07.292
- Oh, Jesus.
- 'Cause I gotta tell you,

01:40:07.377 --> 01:40:10.837
it's kind of crazy around me, you know,
with the press and everything.

01:40:10.922 --> 01:40:13.465
Oh, I understand. Yeah.
Look, they're maniacs.

01:40:13.549 --> 01:40:15.842
- Yeah.
- Nothing easier. Follow me.

01:40:15.927 --> 01:40:20.097
I'm not used to this, you know.
I just gotta get out of here.

01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:24.434
Kind of a private person, you know.

01:40:26.187 --> 01:40:28.855
To tell you the truth,
I never killed anybody before.

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:32.609
Having a hard time with it.

01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:36.655
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:39.950
I'm glad you did what you did.

01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:42.577
But I'm sorry.

01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:46.832
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:50.669
So, is it... Is it Jimmy? James?

01:40:52.088 --> 01:40:53.296
James.

01:40:57.427 --> 01:40:58.885
James'll do.

01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:18.530
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

01:41:20.575 --> 01:41:22.909
Why didn't you pay the ransom?

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:28.957
Well, because I was dealing
with human garbage.

01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:31.793
No contract would have been
honored, not by them.

01:41:32.628 --> 01:41:34.755
You know, the funny thing is,
I would have paid 10 times as much

01:41:34.839 --> 01:41:37.799
if I had any sense that
they'd stick to the deal, but no.

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:40.051
- Really.
- Oh, yeah. Really.

01:41:43.389 --> 01:41:45.557
The thing that really kills me
about that is the woman.

01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:47.851
She'd been in this house five, six times
over the last year.

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.645
Nice. Pleasant. You know.
You just can't...

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:54.065
I don't know how people
can walk around with that...

01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:56.943
That cold-blooded, two-faced...

01:41:57.028 --> 01:41:59.279
That bitch.

01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:02.157
Well, you know, in fairness to the dead,

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.702
we're all a little two-faced
in this day and age.

01:42:09.499 --> 01:42:12.793
It's a survival mechanism.
You know what I'm saying?

01:42:18.841 --> 01:42:22.093
I mean, you know, as a cop,

01:42:22.178 --> 01:42:25.305
you should hear some of the stuff that's
been thrown my way over the years.

01:42:25.389 --> 01:42:27.265
Tom, just forget
about the gloves, honey.

01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:28.642
He wanted to come home.

01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:30.101
- Kate...
- Hi, Tom.

01:42:30.186 --> 01:42:33.271
- Mr. Shaker's here.
- Mr. Shaker.

01:42:46.536 --> 01:42:49.371
God bless you. Thank you.

01:42:50.915 --> 01:42:53.708
- You're welcome.
- Listen, you gotta meet Sean.

01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:55.377
I'll go get him.

01:42:55.586 --> 01:43:00.632
No, he's, you know, had enough.
Let's give him a breather. Yeah?

01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:06.137
Yeah, yeah. He's had enough.

01:43:06.973 --> 01:43:09.391
Okay. Can I get you anything?

01:43:09.475 --> 01:43:12.018
No, I'm fine.

01:43:12.103 --> 01:43:13.520
Again, I can't even begin to...

01:43:13.604 --> 01:43:15.939
I understand. Don't mention it.

01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:19.276
Okay.

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:25.532
Fatima, would you please
help me with some things downstairs?

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:27.450
I'll be right there.

01:43:34.584 --> 01:43:38.044
Well, this is one hell of a deposit
you've got here.

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:40.630
Shouldn't be a problem.

01:43:50.933 --> 01:43:53.643
Well, you'll probably
wanna be on your way.

01:43:53.769 --> 01:43:56.897
Unless there's anything else
I can do for you.

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:03.153
Good. Right.

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:07.157
Well, I know how these vultures
out there can drive you nuts, so...

01:44:07.283 --> 01:44:08.617
You know, there's a back door out

01:44:08.701 --> 01:44:09.910
if you, you know,
wanna be a little more...

01:44:09.994 --> 01:44:12.329
This check is bullshit, Tom.

01:44:14.415 --> 01:44:16.124
What'd you think,
I'm just gonna waltz out of here,

01:44:16.208 --> 01:44:18.960
you lying motherfucker? Huh?

01:44:19.045 --> 01:44:20.253
Let you make a phone call,

01:44:20.338 --> 01:44:24.257
have half the cops in New York
waiting for me while I cash this thing?

01:44:24.342 --> 01:44:26.301
- You can't lie to me.
- Look...

01:44:26.385 --> 01:44:28.053
Shut your mouth.

01:44:30.556 --> 01:44:31.723
Fuck!

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:47.238
You know who I am. Now you sit down.

01:44:48.991 --> 01:44:51.534
Everybody was gonna make out fine.

01:44:52.828 --> 01:44:55.246
But you had to go and put it together,

01:44:55.331 --> 01:44:58.500
and now we got
a little problem here, don't we?

01:45:01.212 --> 01:45:03.922
Tell me that part again about
why you didn't pay the ransom.

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:05.840
- I think we can do something here...
- Say it!

01:45:05.925 --> 01:45:08.093
You were dealing with what?

01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:11.388
You had my son.

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:14.224
You have no idea
what human garbage is, motherfucker.

01:45:15.017 --> 01:45:18.269
Do you know what the fuck you're
talking about? No, I don't think you do.

01:45:18.354 --> 01:45:20.730
'Cause look
where you fucking live, man.

01:45:20.815 --> 01:45:22.649
Look at the airline man here.

01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:26.569
This fucker won't pay one cent
to save his only kid.

01:45:26.737 --> 01:45:28.196
It wasn't gonna get him back, was it?

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:30.323
Hey, did you read the papers? Huh?

01:45:30.408 --> 01:45:31.866
Did you see the TV?

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:35.328
I took a bullet.
I risked my life to save your kid.

01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:39.165
I took a bullet, and now you're gonna
try to fuck me out of my money. Huh?

01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:41.001
- What's over here?
- Where are you going?

01:45:41.085 --> 01:45:42.252
Where's Mommy and Junior?

01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:44.963
- Now I'll pay. Now.
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:48.133
You're gonna pay, all right. Right now.

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.427
Do you have an account
I can wire the money to?

01:45:50.511 --> 01:45:52.303
I mean, you got to have been
all set up for this, right?

01:45:52.388 --> 01:45:56.641
I mean, you're not dumb. You and me,
we go right now to my bank,

01:45:57.018 --> 01:45:59.019
and we wire the money
from my account to yours.

01:45:59.103 --> 01:46:01.104
Just the push of a button. Just like that.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.649
We'll just go down to the bank
and get it done.

01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:08.737
Pick up the phone. Wire it from here.

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:14.951
No, we'll go to the bank and do it.

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:20.582
And you'll get the money and all I want
in return is you out of this house now.

01:46:23.502 --> 01:46:26.296
Hey. You do not call the shots.

01:46:27.173 --> 01:46:29.174
Well, then, you just go ahead
and kill me right here and now,

01:46:29.258 --> 01:46:31.259
you son of a bitch.

01:46:31.469 --> 01:46:34.888
You fuck! Fuck you!
I'm not picking up that phone.

01:46:34.972 --> 01:46:37.015
You got that? I'm not picking it up.

01:46:38.559 --> 01:46:42.145
Look, you can kill me.
Go ahead. Kill me. Just kill us.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:44.731
Let us live. Doesn't matter.
Any way you cut it, you're on the run.

01:46:44.815 --> 01:46:46.191
Now, you can come with me
to the bank

01:46:46.275 --> 01:46:48.193
and be on the run with $4 million,

01:46:48.277 --> 01:46:49.944
or you can just start shooting

01:46:50.029 --> 01:46:52.030
and be on the run
with whatever you got in your wallet.

01:46:52.156 --> 01:46:53.740
It's up to you.

01:46:54.283 --> 01:46:57.911
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go to the bank.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:46:58.579 --> 01:47:02.499
I got what I want.
Bottom line, I got my son back.

01:47:02.583 --> 01:47:04.876
And you delivered him.

01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:08.963
I got my own plane. I can fly you out
of here myself anywhere you wanna go.

01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:14.260
You can still win this thing.
Think. You can still win.

01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:35.156
We do what you say.
We go to the bank.

01:47:35.366 --> 01:47:40.203
If anything goes wrong, you're
gonna turn around and I'll be gone.

01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:42.872
Okay? And if that happens,

01:47:43.332 --> 01:47:45.125
from this day on,

01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:48.753
any time your kid leaves
this house to go to school,

01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:51.256
go play, see a friend,

01:47:52.591 --> 01:47:56.678
to buy a fucking comic book,
you're gonna have to ask yourself,

01:47:57.847 --> 01:48:02.225
is today Jimmy Shaker day?

01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:04.936
I got to him once.

01:48:06.147 --> 01:48:07.939
I'll get him again.

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:10.316
And when I do,

01:48:11.527 --> 01:48:14.696
I'm not gonna want money anymore.

01:48:15.406 --> 01:48:17.657
Do we understand each other?

01:48:18.242 --> 01:48:19.409
Sure.

01:48:38.929 --> 01:48:40.680
That's for Maris.

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:50.190
Call the airport.

01:48:56.405 --> 01:48:58.239
Where are we going?

01:48:58.574 --> 01:49:01.075
Mexico. Guadalajara.

01:49:05.623 --> 01:49:10.168
David, this is Tom. Fuel up the jet.
I'm going to Guadalajara.

01:49:11.045 --> 01:49:14.589
Yeah, well, something came up.
I'm on my way to the bank now.

01:49:16.842 --> 01:49:19.636
- Is the kidnapper with you?
- Absolutely.

01:49:21.305 --> 01:49:24.515
I'll explain everything later.
Give Katie a call. Bye.

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:28.353
Antone, get me the Mullen house.

01:49:28.437 --> 01:49:30.897
Sean, what's the matter, honey?

01:49:31.982 --> 01:49:33.816
Come here.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.488
Taxi! Taxi!

01:49:42.534 --> 01:49:44.244
Stay on my right.

01:49:46.455 --> 01:49:48.706
What are you guys doing?
You can't park there.

01:49:48.874 --> 01:49:51.542
Oh, we're just going to the bank.
Five minutes.

01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:55.421
- Shaker?
- Yeah.

01:49:58.467 --> 01:50:00.093
- How you doing, Jimmy?
- How are you?

01:50:00.177 --> 01:50:02.428
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah? You, too.

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:04.555
How you doing, Mr. Mullen?
Good to meet you.

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.225
Just wanna shake your hand, boss.
You made us proud.

01:50:07.309 --> 01:50:09.269
- Well, you know, just doing the job.
- Yeah.

01:50:09.353 --> 01:50:11.688
What do you think of this guy,
Mr. Mullen?

01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:14.691
- Well, what can I say? He's the man.
- Yeah!

01:50:14.775 --> 01:50:16.192
Okay, guys, take it easy.

01:50:16.277 --> 01:50:17.402
- Later, Jimbo.
- Okay.

01:50:17.486 --> 01:50:18.528
- You guys take it easy now.
- All right.

01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:20.446
- You guys not gonna be long, right?
- No, just five minutes.

01:50:20.531 --> 01:50:22.240
- No, no, no.
- No problem.

01:50:29.498 --> 01:50:32.208
Mr. Mullen, what a pleasant surprise.

01:50:32.293 --> 01:50:34.252
Welcome.

01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:37.505
Have I still got any money in this bank?

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:38.715
- Yes.
- I have to do some business

01:50:38.799 --> 01:50:42.468
- with Mr. Shaker here. This is Michael.
- Mr. Shaker, of course. Right this way.

01:50:50.769 --> 01:50:54.147
Terrific. Okay, that's enough.
Let's get this man his money.

01:50:55.441 --> 01:50:57.317
- Thanks very much.
- No, not a problem.

01:50:57.401 --> 01:51:00.778
All units in the 22,
looking for Detective James Shaker,

01:51:00.863 --> 01:51:04.532
white male, 41 years,
wearing black jacket, white shirt.

01:51:04.616 --> 01:51:08.161
Shaker is thought to be in the vicinity
of Madison and 90th Street.

01:51:08.245 --> 01:51:10.330
Subject is an armed
New York City detective.

01:51:10.414 --> 01:51:13.249
Just push enter and it's yours.

01:51:13.792 --> 01:51:15.293
Four million.

01:51:23.886 --> 01:51:24.886
Congratulations.

01:51:25.471 --> 01:51:28.348
Yeah, thanks. Okay.

01:51:35.731 --> 01:51:37.190
Hey, Shaker.

01:51:37.816 --> 01:51:40.193
What's going on?
I just got a call over the radio.

01:51:40.277 --> 01:51:43.946
Oh, hey, it's my birthday. You know,
the guys are trying to pull something.

01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:46.949
- I got it covered.
- Can we talk to you for a second, man?

01:51:47.576 --> 01:51:49.702
No, we have to detain you.

01:51:53.916 --> 01:51:55.500
Shaker! Freeze!

01:52:25.697 --> 01:52:28.366
Hey, he's over here!

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:46.360
Put it down! Put it down!

01:53:46.445 --> 01:53:49.489
- Put the gun down!
- Put the gun down!

01:53:50.324 --> 01:53:53.493
- Put the gun down!
- Hold your fire! Tom, it's me, Lonnie.

01:53:53.577 --> 01:53:54.702
- FBI!
- FBI!

01:53:54.786 --> 01:53:58.331
- Hold your fire!
- It's over, Shaker. Over!

01:53:58.457 --> 01:53:59.624
Drop it!

01:53:59.708 --> 01:54:02.502
Put the gun down, Tom.
Put the gun down.

01:54:02.836 --> 01:54:05.338
- No!
- Step away! Tom!

01:54:05.422 --> 01:54:07.548
- Drop it now! Drop it now!
- Put the gun down, Tom,

01:54:07.633 --> 01:54:10.134
- and walk away.
- Mullen, put the goddamn gun down!

01:54:10.219 --> 01:54:12.053
Put the gun down.

01:54:12.137 --> 01:54:14.597
- Down, Mullen! Now!
- Come on. Come on.

01:54:14.681 --> 01:54:16.390
Put the gun down.

01:54:16.475 --> 01:54:18.809
- Drop the gun!
- Come on. Walk toward me.

01:54:18.894 --> 01:54:21.270
- Tom, don't do nothing stupid.
- Put down the gun now!

01:54:21.355 --> 01:54:24.106
- Put the gun down, Tom!
- Drop it!

01:54:28.111 --> 01:54:31.781
On the ground, Shaker! On the ground!

01:54:31.865 --> 01:54:34.992
- Tom, put the gun down now!
- Down!

01:54:35.077 --> 01:54:37.620
Stay right there!
Now, don't move!

01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:40.081
Put the gun down.

01:54:40.499 --> 01:54:43.793
That's right. Now, back off, Tom.
Just walk away.

01:55:05.148 --> 01:55:06.566
Go ahead, Officer.

01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:10.570
Two-one, Sergeant. Code eight.
A want at 1268 Madison, forthwith.

01:55:10.654 --> 01:55:13.364
We have shots fired,
and a member of the service is down.

01:55:13.448 --> 01:55:15.533
10-4. The bus is ordered.

01:55:16.410 --> 01:55:18.786
Get up against the wall!
Move! Spread 'em!

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:21.872
Tom Mullen is with us! Back away!

01:55:22.416 --> 01:55:25.293
No! No!
