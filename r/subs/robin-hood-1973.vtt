WEBVTT

00:35.494 --> 00:36.827
You know, there's
been a heap of legends

00:36.912 --> 00:39.121
and tall tales
about Robin Hood.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.706
All different too.

00:41.291 --> 00:45.503
Well, we folks of the animal
kingdom have our own version.

00:45.712 --> 00:49.507
It's the story of what really
happened in Sherwood Forest.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.715
Incidentally,
I'm Allan-a-Dale, a minstrel.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.676
That's an early-day folk singer.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.136
And my job is to

03:40.220 --> 03:43.556
tell it like it is.
Or was, or whatever.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.938
Robin Hood and Little John
walking through the forest

03:51.022 --> 03:53.774
Laughing back and forth at
what the other'n has to say

03:56.445 --> 03:57.737
Reminiscing this and that

03:57.821 --> 03:59.530
And having such a good time

04:01.032 --> 04:02.742
Golly, what a day

04:05.454 --> 04:07.955
Never, ever thinking
there was danger in the water

04:08.039 --> 04:11.083
They were drinking
They just guzzled it down

04:11.168 --> 04:13.961
Never dreaming
that a scheming sheriff and his posse

04:14.045 --> 04:18.673
Was a-watching them
and gathering around

04:18.800 --> 04:21.343
Robin Hood and Little John
running through the forest

04:21.678 --> 04:25.556
Jumping fences, dodging trees
and trying to get away

04:27.684 --> 04:29.518
Contemplating nothing
but escaping

04:29.603 --> 04:30.853
And finally making it

04:32.147 --> 04:33.355
Golly, what a day

04:37.319 --> 04:40.362
Golly, what a day

04:42.032 --> 04:44.784
You know something, Robin?
You're taking too many chances.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.412
Chances?
You must be joking.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.372
That was just a bit of a lark,
Little John.

04:50.707 --> 04:55.252
Yeah? Take a look at your hat.
That's not a candle on a cake.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.923
Hello. This one almost
had my name on it, didn't it?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.883
They're getting better, you know.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.969
You've got to admit it.
They are getting better.

05:04.054 --> 05:08.224
Yeah. The next time that sheriff'll
probably have a rope around our necks.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.769
Pretty hard to laugh
hanging there, Rob.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.979
The sheriff
and his whole posse

05:14.064 --> 05:15.898
couldn't lift you
off the ground.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.400
- En garde!
- Hey, watch it, Rob.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.902
That's the only hat I've got.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.571
Come along.
You worry too much, old boy.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.574
You know something, Robin?
I was just wondering.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.993
Are we good guys or bad guys?

05:28.078 --> 05:29.495
You know. I mean,

05:29.579 --> 05:31.914
our robbing the rich
to feed the poor.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.666
"Rob"?

05:33.750 --> 05:36.293
That's a naughty word.
We never rob.

05:36.378 --> 05:40.130
We just sort of borrow a bit
from those who can afford it.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.759
Borrow? Boy, are we in debt.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.521
That sounds like another
collection day for the poor.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.772
Hey, Johnny boy?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.943
Yeah. Sweet charity.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.898
Taxes! Taxes!

06:38.982 --> 06:42.151
Beautiful, lovely taxes!

06:43.778 --> 06:46.697
Sire, you have an absolute skill

06:46.781 --> 06:49.533
for encouraging contributions
from the poor.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.077
To coin a phrase,
my dear counsellor,

06:52.162 --> 06:55.497
rob the poor to feed the rich.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.249
Am I right?

06:57.334 --> 07:01.337
Tell me, what is
the next stop, Sir Hiss?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.297
Let me see. I...

07:03.798 --> 07:07.051
Yes. The next stop
is Nottingham, sire.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.054
The richest plum of them all.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.223
Nottingham.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.938
A perfect fit, sire. Most becoming.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.358
You look regal, dignified,
sincere, masterful,

07:22.442 --> 07:23.651
noble...

07:23.735 --> 07:26.236
Don't... Don't overdo it, Hiss.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.866
There. That, I believe, does it.

07:31.534 --> 07:35.120
This crown gives me
a feeling of power!

07:35.288 --> 07:36.538
Power!

07:36.706 --> 07:40.125
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.877
Power.

07:42.045 --> 07:46.340
And how well King Richard's
crown sits on your noble brow.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.633
Doesn't it?

07:47.717 --> 07:50.094
King Richard?

07:50.178 --> 07:54.306
Look, I've told you never
to mention my brother's name!

07:54.391 --> 07:56.934
A mere slip of
the forked tongue, Your Majesty.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.230
We're in this plot together,
if you don't mind my saying so.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.817
And remember, it was your idea
I hypnotised him and...

08:04.943 --> 08:09.613
I know. And sent him off
on that crazy crusade.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.202
Much to the sorrow
of the Queen Mother.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.788
Yes! Mother.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.710
Mother always did
like Richard best.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.923
Your Highness,
please don't do that.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.426
If you don't mind
my saying so, you see,

08:30.510 --> 08:32.594
you have a very loud thumb.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.433
Hypnotism could rid you
of your psychosis

08:38.518 --> 08:42.855
so easily.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.900
No! None of that! None of that.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.777
Well, I was only trying to help.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.321
I wonder.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.740
Silly serpent.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.367
- "Silly serpent"?
- Now look here.

08:55.577 --> 08:59.788
One more hiss out of you, Hiss,

08:59.873 --> 09:03.167
and you are walking
to Nottingham.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.462
Snakes don't walk. They slither.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.965
So there.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.874
Now what about that for luck?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.336
It's only a circus.
A peanut operation.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.589
"Peanuts"? Why, you dunce.
That's the royal coach.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.509
- It's Prince John himself.
- The prince?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.928
Wait a minute. There's a law
against robbing royalty.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.222
- I'll catch you later.
- What?

09:58.306 --> 10:01.183
And miss this chance
to perform before royalty?

10:03.394 --> 10:04.520
Here we go again.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.527
Fortune tellers!

10:11.903 --> 10:14.488
Fortunes forecast! Lucky charms!

10:14.572 --> 10:17.950
Get the dope
with your horoscope.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.245
Fortune tellers! How droll.
Stop the coach.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.039
Sire, sire, they may be bandits.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.750
Poppycock. Female bandits?

10:26.835 --> 10:29.253
What next? Rubbish.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.673
My dear ladies,

10:32.757 --> 10:36.468
you have my permission
to kiss the royal hands.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.762
Whichever you like, first.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.517
How gracious!

10:43.893 --> 10:46.812
- And generous.
- Sire! Sire!

10:46.896 --> 10:48.939
- Did you see what they...
- Stop!

10:49.023 --> 10:50.274
Stop hissing in my ear.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.410
Hiss! You've hissed your last...

11:02.328 --> 11:03.370
Hiss.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.586
Suspicious snake.

11:10.712 --> 11:14.006
Masterfully done, Your Excellency.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.926
Now close your eyes and concentrate.

11:18.011 --> 11:22.181
Close your eyes. Tight shut.
No peeking, sire.

11:23.391 --> 11:29.354
From the mists of time,
come forth, spirits.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.444
Okay, little fireflies.
Glow, babies, glow.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.113
We're waiting.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.618
Look, sire. Look!

11:44.245 --> 11:45.621
Incredible.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.207
Floating spirits.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.420
Naughty, naughty.
You mustn't touch, young man.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.631
How dare you strike the royal hand.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.426
You'll break the spell.
Just gaze into the crystal ball.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.726
A face appears.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.356
A crown is on his noble brow.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.109
A crown! How exciting!

12:16.653 --> 12:18.737
His face is handsome,

12:19.489 --> 12:22.783
regal, majestic,

12:23.159 --> 12:27.496
loveable, a cuddly face.

12:27.872 --> 12:31.291
Handsome, regal, majestic.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.335
Loveable. Yes, yes.

12:33.503 --> 12:38.090
Cuddly. That's me to a T.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.009
It really is. Yes.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.637
- I...
- Now what?

12:45.723 --> 12:46.848
I...

12:46.933 --> 12:50.769
I see your illustrious name.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.397
I know my name! Get on with it!

12:53.773 --> 12:55.816
Your name will go down,

12:55.900 --> 12:59.778
down, down, in history, of course.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.572
Yes! I knew it! I knew it!

13:02.699 --> 13:05.200
Do you hear that, Hiss? You can't...

13:05.660 --> 13:07.369
He's in the basket.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.871
Don't forget it.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.334
What have we here?

13:14.544 --> 13:18.046
Solid-gold hubcaps.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.310
The jackpot.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.017
Robbed! I've been robbed!

14:12.810 --> 14:15.354
Hiss! You're never around
when I need you!

14:17.690 --> 14:20.275
- I've been robbed.
- Of course you've been robbed!

14:22.695 --> 14:25.072
Fortunes forecast. Lucky charms.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.656
After them, you fools!

14:41.255 --> 14:44.883
No, no, no, no!

14:45.093 --> 14:48.553
I knew it. I knew it.
I just knew this would happen.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.888
I tried to warn you, but no,

14:49.972 --> 14:52.766
you wouldn't listen.
You just had to...

14:53.184 --> 14:54.309
Seven years' bad

14:55.228 --> 14:57.771
luck. That's what it is.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.400
Besides, you broke
your mother's mirror.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.569
Mommy!

15:06.197 --> 15:07.864
I've got a dirty thumb.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.123
Well, even though Prince John

15:16.207 --> 15:19.543
offered a huge reward
for the capture of Robin Hood,

15:19.669 --> 15:22.712
that elusive rogue kept
right on robbing the rich

15:22.797 --> 15:23.880
to feed the poor.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.466
And believe me,
it's a good thing he did

15:26.551 --> 15:28.301
'cause what with taxes and all,

15:28.386 --> 15:32.222
the poor folks of Nottingham
were starving to death.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.725
Here comes
old Bad News himself,

15:36.227 --> 15:39.020
the honourable
sheriff of Nottingham.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.606
Every town

15:41.691 --> 15:44.359
Has its taxes too

15:44.444 --> 15:47.028
And the taxes is due

15:49.449 --> 15:51.366
Well, lookie there.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.953
Friar Tuck,
the old do-gooder.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.830
He's out doing good again.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.546
- Well, good morning, Friar Tuck.
- Otto.

16:05.006 --> 16:08.008
For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.011
God bless Robin Hood.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.438
It's the sheriff! Hurry, hide it! Quick!

16:21.522 --> 16:24.232
Here I come. Ready or not.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.985
Well, greetings

16:27.069 --> 16:30.614
from your friendly
neighbourhood tax collector.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.283
Take it easy on me, sheriff.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.827
What, with this
busted leg and all, you know,

16:35.912 --> 16:38.413
I'm way behind
in me work, sheriff.

16:38.539 --> 16:43.210
I know, Otto, but you're
way behind with your taxes too.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.879
Have a heart, sheriff.

16:45.963 --> 16:49.716
Can't you see he's laid up?
Come on, Otto.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.760
You'd better sit down and rest.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.012
Thank you. Yes.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.061
Let me give you a hand
with that leg.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.896
Upsadaisy.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.397
Bingo!

17:06.608 --> 17:09.069
What they won't think of next.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.156
It smarts, don't it, Otto?

17:14.282 --> 17:17.661
But Prince John says
that taxes should hurt.

17:17.787 --> 17:21.705
Now see here, you...
You evil, flint-hearted leech!

17:21.790 --> 17:25.502
Now, now, now, now!
Save your sermon, preacher.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.921
It ain't Sunday, you know.

17:30.633 --> 17:34.302
They call me a slob
but I do my job

17:36.055 --> 17:40.183
Happy birthday to you

17:40.268 --> 17:44.187
Happy birthday to you

17:44.272 --> 17:48.817
Happy birthday, dear Skippy

17:49.443 --> 17:51.194
Happy birthday

17:51.946 --> 17:55.782
To you

17:55.866 --> 17:59.828
Well, now, sonny, that box is
done up right pretty, ain't it?

18:00.162 --> 18:04.874
Well, Mr Sheriff, sir,
it's my birthday present, sir.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.836
It sure is. Why don't you open it?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.882
Oh, boy! One whole farthing!

18:14.468 --> 18:16.011
Have you no heart?

18:16.345 --> 18:20.098
We all scrimped and saved
to give it to him.

18:20.182 --> 18:24.185
Now that's mighty thoughty
of you, widow woman.

18:24.270 --> 18:29.024
The family that saves
together pays together.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.901
Now, don't take it so hard, sonny.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.030
Prince John wishes you
a happy birthday too.

18:35.573 --> 18:40.035
Alms, alms, alms for the poor.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.912
Well.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.004
Well, so far it's been
a cheerful morning.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.589
Keep saving!

18:52.715 --> 18:54.549
What a dirty trick.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.969
You poor old man.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.723
Do come in.
Come in and rest yourself.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.851
Thank you kindly, Mother.
Thank you.

19:04.935 --> 19:09.731
Tell me now. Did me old ears
hear someone singing a birthday ditty?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.359
Yes, sir.

19:12.443 --> 19:17.072
And that mean old sheriff
took my birthday present.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.324
Did he now?

19:19.408 --> 19:23.411
But be a stouthearted little lad
and don't let it get you down.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.581
Gee whiz! It's Robin Hood!

19:27.083 --> 19:28.958
Happy birthday, son!

19:30.044 --> 19:34.172
He's so handsome,
just like his reward posters.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.801
Tell me, young man,
how old are you today?

19:37.885 --> 19:40.470
Gosh, I'm seven years old,
going on eight.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.180
Seven?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.849
Well, that does make you
the man of the house,

19:44.934 --> 19:47.435
and I've got just the right
present for you.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.854
For me?

19:49.939 --> 19:53.983
Gee, thanks,
Mr Robin Hood, sir.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.860
Hey, how do I look?

19:56.153 --> 19:58.863
Not much like Mr Robin Hood.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.282
She's right.
There is something missing.

20:01.367 --> 20:05.662
Of course! There you go.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.873
Boy, oh, boy.
Now, how do I look?

20:10.793 --> 20:12.210
The hat's too big.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.671
Mind your manners.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.881
Yes, mind your matters.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.219
Don't worry.
You'll grow into it, young man.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.805
I'm gonna try it out.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.558
Goodbye, Mr Robin Hood!

20:26.642 --> 20:28.560
Come again on my birthday!

20:30.396 --> 20:34.149
You have made his birthday
a wonderful one.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.359
How can I ever thank you?

20:36.777 --> 20:38.486
I only wish I could do more.

20:38.612 --> 20:42.073
Here. And keep your chin up.

20:42.158 --> 20:46.077
Someday there'll be happiness
again in Nottingham. You'll see.

20:46.162 --> 20:51.458
Robin Hood. You've risked
so much to keep our hopes alive.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.586
Bless you. Bless you.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.934
Gee, did Robin Hood
really give it to you?

21:10.019 --> 21:12.353
Yeah, and this is his own hat too.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.856
Gee, I'd sure like to
shoot your bow and arrow.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.357
Let me try it, Skippy.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.152
No, you don't.
I'm gonna shoot it first.

21:19.236 --> 21:23.031
- You're pointing it too high.
- I'm not either. Watch this.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.123
Now you've done it.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.210
Right in Prince John's backyard.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.261
Skippy, you can't go in there.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.515
Yeah. Prince John
will chop off your head.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.726
Like this.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.103
Oh, I don't care.
I gotta get my arrow.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.439
Wait a minute.
Toby might tattle on you.

21:56.524 --> 21:59.484
Yeah, Toby.
You gotta take the oath.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.693
An oath?

22:00.903 --> 22:03.780
Put your hand on your heart
and cross your eyes.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.992
Spiders, snakes and a lizard head.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.037
Spiders, snakes and a lizard's head.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.665
If I tattletale, I'll die till I'm dead.

22:14.250 --> 22:18.753
If I tattletale, I'll die till I'm dead.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.433
It's your turn to serve, Marian, dear.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.852
Are you ready, Lady Kluck?

22:33.978 --> 22:36.688
As your lady-in-waiting,
I'm waiting.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.159
I'm getting
too old for this.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.703
That was a good shot.

22:51.787 --> 22:55.164
You're not bad yourself, dear.
My girdle's killing me.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.591
Where is it?
Did you lose it?

23:04.717 --> 23:07.886
- It must be in there someplace.
- Klucky, you look so silly.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.890
Look. There it is, behind you.

23:14.852 --> 23:15.894
Well, hello.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.770
Where did you come from?

23:17.855 --> 23:20.690
Please don't tell Prince John.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.234
Mama said
he'll chop off my head.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.904
Don't be afraid.
You've done nothing wrong.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.948
Marian, what a bonny wee bunny.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.659
Who does this young archer
remind you of?

23:33.579 --> 23:37.749
Well, upon my word,
the notorious Robin Hood.

23:37.833 --> 23:41.502
That's right. Only Robin Hood
wears a hat like that.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.631
Yeah, and look at this
keen Robin Hood bow.

23:49.011 --> 23:52.430
Marian, don't look around,

23:52.514 --> 23:54.515
but I do believe
we're surrounded.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.770
- Oh, mercy!
- He snitched on us.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.355
It's all right, children.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.107
Don't be afraid.
Please come here.

24:03.192 --> 24:06.819
- Do you think it's safe?
- That's Maid Marian.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.948
Mama said she's awful nice.
Come on!

24:11.867 --> 24:15.828
Hey, you guys, not so fast.
Wait for me.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.790
I told Skippy
he was shooting too high.

24:18.874 --> 24:23.586
I'm so very glad he did.
Now I get to meet all of you.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.464
Gee, you're very beautiful.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.299
Are you gonna marry
Robin Hood?

24:28.384 --> 24:32.637
Mama said you and Robin Hood
are sweethearts.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.057
Well...

24:36.141 --> 24:39.102
You see, that was several years
ago before I left for London.

24:39.603 --> 24:44.232
- Did he ever kiss you?
- Well, no.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.568
But he carved our initials
on this tree.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.949
- I remember it so well.
- You gonna have any kids?

24:53.242 --> 24:55.660
My mom gots a lot of kids.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.079
He's probably
forgotten all about me.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.665
Not Robin Hood.

25:00.749 --> 25:04.085
I bet he'll storm the castle gates,
fight the guards,

25:04.461 --> 25:06.921
rescue you and drag you
off to Sherwood Forest.

25:07.464 --> 25:11.467
Now just a moment there,
young man.

25:11.552 --> 25:14.053
You've forgotten Prince John.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.597
That old Prince John
don't scare me none.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.809
I'm scared of Prince John.

25:19.893 --> 25:20.977
He's cranky.

25:22.938 --> 25:27.191
I, Prince John,
challenge you to a duel.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.317
Hey, hey!

25:28.485 --> 25:31.279
Take that! And that! And this!

25:33.407 --> 25:35.616
Death to tyrants!

25:38.954 --> 25:40.204
Slice him to pieces!

25:40.456 --> 25:44.500
Save me, my hero. Save me.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.087
That's not fair.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.466
Mommy!

25:51.967 --> 25:54.802
That's Prince John, all right.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.306
Now I've got you!

25:59.183 --> 26:01.059
Mercy! Mercy!

26:03.395 --> 26:06.731
He got me. I'm dying.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.692
Did I hurt you?

26:09.777 --> 26:14.614
No. This is the part where you drag
your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.659
Come on, lady fair! Let's go!

26:19.495 --> 26:23.998
Robin, you're so brave and impetuous.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.753
So this is Sherwood Forest.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.923
Yeah, I guess so.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.008
Well, now what are we gonna do?

26:34.426 --> 26:38.179
Well, usually the hero
gives his fair lady a kiss.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.682
A kiss? That's sissy stuff.

26:42.017 --> 26:45.520
Well, if you won't, then I will.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.816
They're kissing!

27:20.973 --> 27:24.183
Ah, me. Young love.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.561
It's a grand thing.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.858
Klucky, surely he must know
how much I still love him.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.569
But, of course, my dear.

27:34.987 --> 27:39.740
Believe me, someday soon,
your uncle, King Richard,

27:39.867 --> 27:42.910
will have an outlaw
for an in-law.

27:44.246 --> 27:48.457
Oh, Klucky.
But when? When?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.960
Patience, my dear. Patience.

27:51.044 --> 27:54.297
Remember, absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.883
Or forgetful.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.469
I've been away so long.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.598
What if he's forgotten
all about me?

28:16.445 --> 28:18.196
Hey, lover boy.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.573
How's that grub coming?
Man, I'm starved.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.746
Rob? Robin?

28:27.956 --> 28:29.957
Robert?

28:30.250 --> 28:33.753
- Hey!
- What? What do you say?

28:33.879 --> 28:36.589
Forget it.
Your mind's not on food.

28:36.924 --> 28:40.343
You're thinking about somebody
with long eyelashes,

28:40.427 --> 28:43.137
and you're smelling
that sweet perfume.

28:46.475 --> 28:50.311
- Hey, whoa! It's boiling over!
- You're burning the chow!

28:52.272 --> 28:53.481
Sorry, Johnny.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.317
Guess I was thinking
about Maid Marian again.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.319
I can't help it.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.239
I love her, Johnny.

29:01.615 --> 29:04.533
Look, why don't you stop
mooning and moping around?

29:04.618 --> 29:08.329
- Just marry the girl.
- Marry her?

29:08.455 --> 29:11.707
You don't just walk up to a girl,
hand her a bouquet and say,

29:11.792 --> 29:14.627
"Hey, remember me? We were kids
together. Will you marry me?"

29:14.711 --> 29:17.630
No. It just isn't done that way.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.801
Come on, Robbie.
Climb the castle walls.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.472
Sweep her off her feet.
Carry her off in style.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.850
It's no use, Johnny.
I've thought it all out

29:29.935 --> 29:31.894
and it just wouldn't work.

29:31.979 --> 29:34.105
Besides, what have
I got to offer her?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.357
Well, for one thing,
you can't cook.

29:36.733 --> 29:40.069
I'm serious, Johnny.
She's a highborn lady of quality.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.905
So she's got class? So what?

29:43.031 --> 29:44.782
I'm an outlaw, that's what.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.786
That's no life for a lovely lady.
Always on the run.

29:49.204 --> 29:53.582
- What kind of a future is that?
- For heaven's sake, son.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.127
You're no outlaw.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.463
Why, someday you'll be called
a great hero.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.340
A hero?

30:01.425 --> 30:03.759
Do you hear that, Johnny?
We've just been pardoned.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.805
That's a gas.
We ain't even been arrested yet.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.141
All right. Laugh, you two rogues.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.812
But there's gonna be
a big to-do in Nottingham.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.733
Well-done, ain't it?

30:18.900 --> 30:21.152
Old Prince John's having

30:21.236 --> 30:23.946
a championship
archery tournament tomorrow.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.324
Archery tournament?

30:26.408 --> 30:29.160
Old Rob could win that
standing on his head, huh, Rob?

30:29.786 --> 30:34.081
Thank you, Little John,
but I'm sure we're not invited.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.001
No, but there's somebody

30:37.085 --> 30:40.129
who'll be very disappointed
if you don't come.

30:40.422 --> 30:43.090
Yeah, old bushel britches,

30:43.175 --> 30:45.426
the honourable sheriff
of Nottingham.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.596
No, Maid Marian.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.432
- Maid Marian?
- Yeah.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.185
She's gonna give
a kiss to the winner.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.438
A kiss to the winner!

30:59.066 --> 31:01.442
Come on, Johnny!
What are we waiting for?

31:01.526 --> 31:03.194
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it.

31:03.278 --> 31:06.405
That place will be
crawling with soldiers.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.076
But, remember.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.371
Faint hearts never
won fair lady.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.706
Fear not, my friends.

31:17.334 --> 31:20.461
This will be
my greatest performance.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.121
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.

31:55.205 --> 31:59.291
A coup d'Ã©tat,
to coin a Norman phrase.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.086
Yes, indeed, sire.

32:02.170 --> 32:06.382
Your plan to capture Robin Hood
in public is sheer genius.

32:07.592 --> 32:11.178
Hiss, no one sits
higher than the king.

32:11.513 --> 32:14.348
Must I remind you, Hiss?

32:16.726 --> 32:18.978
Forgive me, sire. I didn't mean to...

32:19.187 --> 32:21.856
My trap is baited and set,

32:21.982 --> 32:23.774
and then revenge!

32:25.444 --> 32:26.861
Revenge!

32:28.196 --> 32:29.655
Not so loud, sire.

32:29.739 --> 32:34.368
Remember, only you and I know,
and your secret is my secret.

32:34.536 --> 32:36.787
Stop! Stop hissing in my ear.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.665
Secret? What secret?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.877
Why, the capture
of Robin Hood, sire.

32:43.253 --> 32:45.713
That insolent blackguard.

32:46.548 --> 32:49.842
I'll show him
who wears the crown!

32:49.926 --> 32:52.344
I share your loathing, sire.

32:52.429 --> 32:56.098
That scurrilous scoundrel
who fooled you with that silly disguise,

32:56.224 --> 32:59.351
who dared to rob you and made you
look so utterly ridiculous...

32:59.519 --> 33:00.895
Enough!

33:02.147 --> 33:05.274
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.

33:05.567 --> 33:08.903
But... But... Sire, please.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.406
Stop snivelling and hold still.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.037
Thank you, sire.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.748
Klucky, I'm so excited.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.958
But how will I recognise him?

33:23.043 --> 33:25.711
He'll let you know somehow.

33:25.837 --> 33:30.174
That young rogue of yours
is full of surprises, my dear.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.345
There she is, Little John.
Isn't she beautiful?

33:35.430 --> 33:37.431
Cool it, lover boy.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.517
Your heart's running away
with your head.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.060
Stop worrying.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.270
This disguise would
fool my own mother.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.898
Yeah, but your mom ain't here.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.817
You gotta fool
old bushel britches.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.533
- Sheriff, Your Honour?
- Yeah.

33:55.617 --> 33:59.203
Meeting you face-to-face
is a real treat.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.746
A real treat.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.290
Well, now, thank you.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.168
Excuse me.
I gotta go win this tournament.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.713
Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor.

34:09.797 --> 34:13.676
But wait till he sees this scene
I lay on Prince John.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.639
My lord.

34:20.141 --> 34:23.518
My esteemed royal sovereign
of the realm.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.272
The head man himself.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.149
You're beautiful.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.902
He has style, hey, Hiss?

34:38.451 --> 34:40.703
You took the words
right out of my mouth, PJ.

34:41.121 --> 34:44.206
"PJ"! I like that.
Do you know I do?

34:44.331 --> 34:46.542
Hiss, put it on my luggage.

34:46.668 --> 34:47.918
PJ.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.880
PJ. Yes.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.550
And you?

34:54.884 --> 34:57.511
Who might you be, sir?

34:57.679 --> 35:01.348
I am Sir Reginald,
Duke of Chutney.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.393
And don't stick your tongue
out at me, kid.

35:05.687 --> 35:09.815
And now, Your Mightiness,
allow me to lay some protocol on you.

35:09.941 --> 35:14.194
Oh, no. Forgive me,
but I lose more jewels that way than...

35:14.571 --> 35:16.572
Please sit down.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.075
Thanks, PJ. Couldn't get
a better seat than this, could you?

35:20.160 --> 35:22.786
The royal box. Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

35:22.996 --> 35:26.749
What's... Excuse me, buster.

35:26.875 --> 35:31.086
"Buster"? You, sir, have taken my seat.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.384
Hiss, with you around,
who needs a court jester?

35:42.724 --> 35:48.145
Now get out there and keep your
snake eyes open for you-know-who.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.939
You... You mean, I...

35:51.024 --> 35:52.775
I'm being dismissed?

35:52.901 --> 35:56.528
You heard His Mightiness.
Move it, creepy. Get lost.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.406
Begone, long one.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.826
What cheek! "Creepy"?

36:02.952 --> 36:06.038
"Buster"? "Long one"?

36:06.122 --> 36:08.415
Who does that dopey duke
think he is?

36:08.917 --> 36:13.087
- Now, he's up to something, Friar.
- Yeah. Come on!

37:11.312 --> 37:12.896
Your Ladyship.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.232
Begging your pardon,
but it's a great honour

37:15.316 --> 37:19.153
to be shooting for the favour
of a lovely lady like yourself.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.155
I hopes I win the kiss.

37:26.870 --> 37:30.706
Well, thank you,
my thin-legged archer.

37:31.124 --> 37:35.127
I wish you luck,
with all my heart.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.839
I wonder.

37:42.343 --> 37:45.304
Your Highness,
with your royal permission,

37:45.764 --> 37:49.892
- we are ready to begin.
- Proceed, captain!

37:50.351 --> 37:54.480
The tournament of the golden
arrow will now begin.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.219
Yay, Dad!

38:38.817 --> 38:41.735
A perfect bull's-eye.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.987
Well, well.

38:44.781 --> 38:48.116
That's what you call pulling it
back and letting it go, PJ.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.118
I'm gonna win that golden arrow,

38:50.203 --> 38:52.913
and then I'm gonna present
myself to the lovely Maid Marian and...

38:52.997 --> 38:57.793
Listen, scissorbill, if you shoot half as
good as you blabbermouth,

38:57.877 --> 38:59.211
you're better than Robin Hood.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.046
Robin Hood, he says!

39:02.757 --> 39:05.926
I'm tiptop, all right,
but I'm not as good as he is.

39:14.269 --> 39:17.437
That kid's got class.
Ain't he, PJ?

39:17.605 --> 39:20.774
Indeed he has, Reggie.

39:20.859 --> 39:25.279
Bravo! Bravo! Yes.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.532
By the way,

39:28.616 --> 39:32.202
I hear you're having a bit of trouble
getting your hands on that Robin Hood.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.831
He's scared of me,
that's what he is.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.875
You notice he didn't
show up here today.

39:37.959 --> 39:41.795
I could spot him
through them phoney disguises.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.673
It's him! It's Robin Hood!

39:45.300 --> 39:48.844
I just can't wait
till I tell His Majesty.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.398
Unhand me, you...

40:01.482 --> 40:04.192
Please, please! I don't drink!

40:06.988 --> 40:09.323
Attention, everyone.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.782
The final contestants are

40:12.327 --> 40:16.371
the honourable sheriff
of Nottingham

40:19.876 --> 40:25.005
and the spindle-legged stork
from Devonshire.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.763
My dear, I suspect you favour
the gangly youth.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.975
Why, yes, sire.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.436
Well, at least he amuses me.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.065
Coincidently,
my dear young lady,

40:43.149 --> 40:46.026
he amuses me too.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.197
For the final shootout,

40:50.281 --> 40:53.742
move the target
back three paces.

40:54.035 --> 40:55.994
You heard him, Nutsy! Get going!

40:56.204 --> 40:58.246
Move it, you birdbrain.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.292
And remember what
you're supposed to do.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.795
Yes, sir, sheriff, sir.

41:12.887 --> 41:13.887
Well,

41:13.972 --> 41:19.059
that shot wins the golden arrow,
the kiss and the whole caboodle.

41:34.242 --> 41:36.118
Yay! He did it,
he did it, he did it!

42:01.436 --> 42:05.814
Archer, I commend you,
and because of your superior skill,

42:05.898 --> 42:08.942
you shall get what
is coming to you.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.780
Our royal congratulations.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.949
Thank you kindly, Your Highness.

42:16.534 --> 42:21.663
Meeting you face-to-face,
Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.750
Release the royal fingers.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.255
And now I name you the winner,

42:30.631 --> 42:32.924
or, more appropriately,

42:34.427 --> 42:35.635
the loser!

42:39.307 --> 42:41.058
Seize him.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.316
I sentence you to sudden,
instant and even

42:49.442 --> 42:51.860
immediate death!

42:52.528 --> 42:54.321
Oh, no!

42:56.199 --> 42:57.616
Please.

42:57.700 --> 43:01.536
Please, sire.
I beg of you to spare his life.

43:01.662 --> 43:04.331
Please have mercy.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.417
My dear emotional lady,
why should I?

43:07.919 --> 43:09.920
Because I love him,
Your Highness.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.047
Love him?

43:12.173 --> 43:15.926
And does this prisoner
return your love?

43:18.679 --> 43:22.849
Marian, my darling,
I love you more than life itself.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.394
Young love.

43:26.479 --> 43:31.775
Your pleas have not fallen
upon a heart of stone,

43:32.443 --> 43:35.320
but traitors
to the crown must die!

43:35.404 --> 43:38.031
Traitor to the crown?
That crown belongs to King Richard.

43:38.407 --> 43:42.160
- Long live King Richard!
- Long live King Richard!

43:42.245 --> 43:44.830
Enough! I am king!

43:44.914 --> 43:46.873
King! King!

43:47.667 --> 43:49.543
Off with his head!

44:03.141 --> 44:04.391
Oh, no.

44:06.978 --> 44:10.021
Stop! Executioner, stop!

44:10.106 --> 44:11.898
Hold your axe!

44:12.066 --> 44:15.735
Okay, big shot. Now tell them
to untie my buddy, or I'll...

44:16.279 --> 44:19.114
Sheriff, release my buddy...

44:19.782 --> 44:22.325
I mean, release the prisoner!

44:22.410 --> 44:24.828
Untie the prisoner?

44:25.121 --> 44:27.539
You heard what he said,
bushel britches.

44:27.623 --> 44:33.128
Sheriff, I make the rules,
and since I am the head man...

44:33.379 --> 44:36.047
Not so hard, you mean thing.

44:36.757 --> 44:40.260
Let him go, for heaven's sakes!
Let him go!

44:42.263 --> 44:44.139
Love conquers all!

44:49.270 --> 44:51.354
I owe my life to you,
my darling.

44:51.647 --> 44:55.108
I couldn't have lived
without you, Robin.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.819
There's something funny
going on around here.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.989
Now, PJ, tell my pal
to kiss Maid Marian,

45:01.073 --> 45:04.451
- or I've just found a new pincushion.
- Why, you!

45:06.287 --> 45:09.915
Kill him! Don't stand there!
Kill him!

45:25.431 --> 45:28.808
Don't hurt me! No, no!
Don't hurt me! Help! Help!

45:33.856 --> 45:35.774
Kill him!

45:36.150 --> 45:39.903
Run for it, lassie!
This is no place for a lady!

45:44.742 --> 45:47.160
Take that, you scoundrel.

45:47.536 --> 45:49.496
Help! Robin, help!

45:54.210 --> 45:55.877
Marian, my love,
will you marry me?

45:55.962 --> 45:58.713
Darling, I thought you'd never ask me.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.968
But you could've
chosen a more romantic setting.

46:04.845 --> 46:07.097
- And for our honeymoon, London!
- Yes!

46:07.181 --> 46:10.558
- Normandy! Sunny Spain!
- Yes! Why not?

46:13.312 --> 46:16.147
What a main event this is.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.695
What a beautiful brawl.

46:30.246 --> 46:33.498
Hey! Who's driving
this flying umbrella?

46:41.048 --> 46:43.675
- We'll have six children.
- Six?

46:43.759 --> 46:45.927
A dozen at least.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.057
Take that!

46:56.105 --> 46:57.647
Attention, everyone.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.767
Stop the girl!

47:34.935 --> 47:37.979
Take that, you scurvy knave!

47:38.147 --> 47:40.148
Seize the fat one!

48:16.477 --> 48:18.895
Long live King Richard!

48:23.651 --> 48:26.236
Hiss! You're never around
when I need you!

48:26.320 --> 48:28.655
Coming. Coming.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.117
For I'm a jolly good fellow

48:32.284 --> 48:34.077
For I'm a jolly good...

48:38.124 --> 48:39.833
There you are, old boy!

48:40.000 --> 48:44.087
PJ, you won't believe this,
but the stork is really Robin Hood.

48:44.630 --> 48:46.756
Robin Hood.

48:53.222 --> 48:55.765
Get out of that, if you can.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.903
Love

49:08.988 --> 49:12.991
It seems like only yesterday

49:14.577 --> 49:18.246
You were just a child at play

49:20.666 --> 49:22.876
Now you're all grown up

49:23.043 --> 49:26.254
Inside of me

49:26.422 --> 49:30.508
Oh, how fast
those moments flee

49:32.428 --> 49:37.348
Once we watched
a lazy world go by

49:38.434 --> 49:42.562
Now the days seem to fly

49:44.064 --> 49:47.150
Life is brief

49:47.234 --> 49:50.069
But when it's gone

49:50.196 --> 49:54.449
Love goes on and on

50:00.873 --> 50:03.500
Love will live

50:07.171 --> 50:10.048
Love will last

50:13.928 --> 50:17.430
Love goes on

50:17.640 --> 50:20.433
And on and on

50:20.518 --> 50:25.605
Once we watched
a lazy world go by

50:26.649 --> 50:30.944
Now the days seem to fly

50:32.112 --> 50:35.198
Life is brief

50:35.282 --> 50:38.201
But when it's gone

50:38.285 --> 50:43.331
Love goes on and on

50:47.920 --> 50:51.089
Oh, Robin, what a beautiful night.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.925
I wish it would never end.

50:54.009 --> 50:55.552
Surprise!

50:55.803 --> 50:58.179
Long live Robin Hood!

51:00.641 --> 51:03.768
- And long live Maid Marian!
- Bravo!

51:04.270 --> 51:06.688
- Bravo!
- Hear, hear! Bravo! Bravo!

51:06.772 --> 51:08.815
Hooray!

51:09.149 --> 51:12.735
And down with that
scurvy Prince John!

51:12.820 --> 51:14.362
Yeah.

51:15.990 --> 51:18.241
Oh, the world will sing
of an English king

51:18.325 --> 51:20.159
A thousand years from now

51:20.411 --> 51:22.620
And not because
he passed some laws

51:22.705 --> 51:24.581
Or had that lofty brow

51:24.665 --> 51:26.416
While bonny good King Richard

51:26.500 --> 51:28.918
Leads the great crusade he's on

51:29.003 --> 51:31.087
We'll all have to slave away

51:31.171 --> 51:33.381
For that good-for-nothing John

51:33.465 --> 51:35.717
Incredible as he is inept

51:35.926 --> 51:37.760
Whenever the history
books are kept

51:37.970 --> 51:41.681
They'll call him
the phoney king of England

51:42.057 --> 51:46.436
A pox on the phoney
king of England

51:59.366 --> 52:01.784
He sits alone
on a giant throne

52:01.869 --> 52:03.870
Pretending he's the king

52:03.954 --> 52:05.830
A little tyke who's rather like

52:05.914 --> 52:07.957
A puppet on a string

52:08.042 --> 52:10.168
And he throws an angry tantrum

52:10.252 --> 52:12.128
If he cannot have his way

52:12.212 --> 52:14.297
And then he calls for Mom

52:14.381 --> 52:16.549
While he's sucking his thumb

52:17.259 --> 52:19.719
You see he doesn't wanna play

52:21.013 --> 52:22.889
Too late to be known
as John the First

52:23.015 --> 52:25.224
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

52:25.309 --> 52:29.312
A pox on that phoney
king of England

52:29.396 --> 52:32.065
Lay that country on me, babe

52:36.403 --> 52:37.820
Come on, Johnny.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.407
Go, laddie, go!

53:03.931 --> 53:06.015
While he taxes us to pieces

53:06.100 --> 53:08.518
And he robs us of our bread

53:08.602 --> 53:10.812
King Richard's crown
keeps slipping down

53:10.896 --> 53:12.313
Around that pointed head

53:12.398 --> 53:14.941
But while there is a merry man

53:15.067 --> 53:17.235
In Robin's wily pack

53:17.319 --> 53:19.404
We'll find a way to make him pay

53:19.488 --> 53:21.072
And steal our money back

53:21.156 --> 53:24.117
A minute before
he knows we're there

53:24.201 --> 53:27.620
Old Rob'll snatch his underwear

53:31.583 --> 53:35.628
The breezy and uneasy
king of England

53:35.713 --> 53:37.547
The snivelling, grovelling

53:38.132 --> 53:40.216
Measly, weaselly

53:40.300 --> 53:42.385
Blabbering, jabbering

53:42.469 --> 53:44.554
Jibbering, jabbering

53:44.638 --> 53:46.472
Plundering, plotting

53:46.807 --> 53:48.891
Wheeling, dealing

53:49.059 --> 53:52.729
Prince John
that phoney king of England

53:52.813 --> 53:54.647
Yeah

54:01.947 --> 54:03.406
He throws an angry tantrum

54:03.490 --> 54:05.950
If he cannot have his way

54:06.243 --> 54:08.161
He calls for Mom
and sucks his thumb

54:08.245 --> 54:10.455
And doesn't want to play

54:10.539 --> 54:12.832
Too late to be known
as John the First

54:13.000 --> 54:16.461
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

54:16.920 --> 54:18.671
How about that?

54:19.631 --> 54:22.300
That's PJ to a T. Let me try.

54:22.384 --> 54:23.885
Let me try.

54:27.806 --> 54:30.767
Too late to be known
as John the First

54:30.851 --> 54:34.812
He's sure to be known
as John the Worst

54:35.147 --> 54:38.775
The fabulous, marvellous,
merciful, chivalrous...

54:38.859 --> 54:40.818
You got it all wrong, Hiss.

54:40.903 --> 54:43.321
The snivelling, grovelling
weaselly, measly...

54:43.405 --> 54:44.405
Enough!

54:46.617 --> 54:49.118
But, sire, it's a big hit.

54:49.244 --> 54:51.704
The whole village is singing it.

54:51.914 --> 54:54.832
They are, are they?

54:54.917 --> 54:58.961
Well, they'll be
singing a different tune.

54:59.046 --> 55:02.965
Double the taxes!
Triple the taxes!

55:03.050 --> 55:05.718
Squeeze every last drop

55:05.803 --> 55:09.597
out of those insolent,
musical peasants.

55:15.229 --> 55:17.063
Man, oh, man.

55:17.231 --> 55:21.400
That Prince John sure
made good his threat.

55:22.236 --> 55:24.570
And his helpless subjects
paid dearly

55:24.655 --> 55:27.281
for his humiliation, believe me.

55:29.034 --> 55:32.328
Taxes, taxes, taxes.

55:32.412 --> 55:36.791
Why, he taxed the heart and soul out of
the poor people of Nottingham.

55:38.001 --> 55:41.879
And if you couldn't pay your taxes,
you went to jail.

55:43.757 --> 55:46.467
Yep, I'm in here too.

55:46.844 --> 55:48.511
Nottingham was in deep trouble.

55:52.099 --> 55:54.976
Every town

55:56.562 --> 55:59.981
Has its ups and downs

56:02.192 --> 56:05.403
Sometimes ups

56:07.573 --> 56:10.366
Outnumber the downs

56:12.202 --> 56:15.454
But not in Nottingham

56:17.291 --> 56:20.459
I'm inclined to believe

56:23.130 --> 56:25.965
If we weren't so down

56:28.051 --> 56:30.803
We'd up and leave

56:33.140 --> 56:35.808
We'd up and fly

56:35.934 --> 56:38.769
If we had wings for flying

56:41.023 --> 56:45.484
Can't you see
the tears we're crying

56:45.819 --> 56:49.405
Can't there be some happiness

56:49.489 --> 56:51.657
For me

56:53.535 --> 56:55.161
Not in Nottingham

57:44.586 --> 57:49.882
Friar Tuck,
I don't think anyone is coming.

57:50.217 --> 57:53.886
You're right, Sexton, but maybe
the sound of this church bell

57:53.971 --> 57:56.931
will bring those poor
people some comfort.

57:59.643 --> 58:03.354
We must do what we can
to keep their hopes alive.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.779
How can there be any hope
with that tyrant Prince John

58:11.863 --> 58:15.032
taxing the heart and soul
out of the poor people?

58:15.242 --> 58:17.994
Yes, those poor people.

58:18.078 --> 58:21.831
Look, our poor box is like our church,

58:22.124 --> 58:24.125
empty.

58:31.925 --> 58:35.678
Friar Tuck, we've saved this.

58:35.804 --> 58:39.348
It's not much,
but please take it for the poor.

58:39.725 --> 58:42.059
Your last farthing?

58:42.769 --> 58:47.356
Little sister,
no one can give more than that.

58:47.983 --> 58:50.151
Bless you both.

58:50.569 --> 58:53.863
We were just saving it
for a rainy day.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.741
Well, it's raining now.

58:57.826 --> 58:59.744
Things can't get worse.

58:59.828 --> 59:01.162
Howdy, Friar.

59:01.246 --> 59:04.957
Well, it looks like
I dropped by just in time.

59:05.459 --> 59:08.044
What does that big-bellied bully
want here?

59:08.128 --> 59:09.295
Father!

59:11.590 --> 59:13.924
Well, what have we got here?

59:14.468 --> 59:16.719
Now, just a minute, sheriff!

59:16.803 --> 59:19.722
That's the poor box!

59:20.140 --> 59:25.436
It sure is, and I'll just
take it for poor Prince John.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.687
Every little bit helps.

59:28.315 --> 59:30.399
You put that back!

59:30.484 --> 59:34.361
And His Majesty also
blesses you, little sister.

59:34.488 --> 59:36.781
You thieving scoundrel!

59:36.990 --> 59:40.367
Now, take it easy, Friar.
I'm just doing my duty.

59:40.494 --> 59:43.287
Collecting taxes for that arrogant,

59:43.371 --> 59:47.166
greedy, ruthless,
no-good Prince John?

59:47.626 --> 59:50.252
Listen, Friar,
you're mighty preachy,

59:50.337 --> 59:54.423
and you're gonna preach
your neck right into a hangman's noose.

59:54.508 --> 59:56.425
Get out of my church!

59:56.968 --> 01:00:00.846
Out! Out! Out! Out!

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.932
Dear me.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.059
You want taxes?

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.106
I'll give you taxes!

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:13.025
Give it to him! Give it to him!
Give it to him, Friar!

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:23.911
You're under arrest
for high treason to the crown.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.206
Oh, no!

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:30.042
There, there, Mother.

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:35.923
Every town

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.345
Has its ups and downs

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.142
Sometimes ups

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:51.730
Outnumber the downs

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.318
But not in Nottingham

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.974
Sire, if I may...

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.851
May venture an opinion,

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:32.188
you're not your usual
cheerful, genial self today.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.820
I know. I know.

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:42.114
You haven't counted
your money for days.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:46.076
It always makes you so happy.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:51.624
Sire,

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.919
taxes are pouring in,
the jail is full.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.380
And I have good news, sire.

01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:02.343
- Friar Tuck is in jail.
- Friar Tuck?

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:06.138
It's Robin Hood I want,
you idiot!

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:11.310
I'd give all my gold if I
could just get my hands on...

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.272
Did you say Friar Tuck?

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:18.943
Did I? Yes, I did.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:22.613
Hiss, I have it!

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:27.993
I'll use that fat friar
as bait to trap Robin Hood.

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:29.995
Another trap?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.456
Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.084
Friar Tuck will be led
to the gallows

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.670
in the village square,
don't you see?

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:43.008
But, sire, hang Friar Tuck?
A man of the church?

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:46.011
Yes, my reluctant reptile.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.723
And when our elusive hero
tries to rescue

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.684
the corpulent cleric,

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:56.855
my men will be ready.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:19.753
Well, Trigger, everything's
rigged up and all set.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.715
Yep, it's one of the prettiest
scaffolds you ever built, sheriff.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.551
Sheriff, don't you
reckon we ought to give

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.511
that there trapdoor a test?

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:37.438
Criminently. Now I know why
your mama called you Nutsy.

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:40.774
Alms. Alms for the poor.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:46.405
Do my old ears hear the
melodious voice of the sheriff?

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.699
That's right, old man.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:51.702
What be going on here?

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.163
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:58.751
No! Hang Friar... Hang Friar Tuck?

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.753
You betcha. At dawn.

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:04.298
And maybe it'll even be
a double hanging.

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:07.051
Dummy up, you dummy.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:10.095
A double hanging?

01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:14.058
Who'll be the other one
who gets the rope?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:17.519
Sheriff, he's getting
too all-fired nosy.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:20.022
I didn't mean nothing.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:25.527
But couldn't there be
trouble if Robin Hood showed up?

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:30.324
Well, wouldn't you know,
sheriff, he guessed it.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.743
Nutsy, button your beak.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.661
No need to worry.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:39.249
The sheriff be too crafty,
too clever and too smart

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.710
for the likes of him, says I.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.213
You hear that, Nutsy?

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:48.217
For being blind, he sure knows
a good man when he sees one,

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.219
says I.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:54.932
Sheriff, I still got a feeling that that
snoopy old codger knows too much.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:57.017
Shut up, Trigger.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.603
He's just a harmless
old blind beggar.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:02.106
Alms.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:05.567
Alms for the poor. Alms.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.569
Alms for the poor.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:11.407
Rob, we can't let them
hang Friar Tuck.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:14.618
A jailbreak tonight
is the only chance he's got.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.871
A jailbreak? There ain't
no way you can get him.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.458
We've got to, Johnny,
or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:25.898
One o'clock, and all's well!

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:36.283
Nutsy, you'd better set your
brains ahead a couple of hours.

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:38.202
Yes, sir.

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:41.747
Does that there mean
adding or subtracting?

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:45.751
- Let's forget it.
- Yes, sir, sheriff, sir.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.795
Nutsy, how can I sleep
with you yelling,

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.049
"All's well!" all the time here?

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:55.010
Sheriff, everything ain't "all's well. "

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:58.347
I got a feeling in my bones
there's gonna be a jailbreak any minute.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:02.267
Criminently, Trigger!
Point that peashooter the other way.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:06.313
Don't you worry none, sheriff.
The safety's on Old Betsy.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.779
What in tarnation
you trying to do,

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.448
- you birdbrain?
- Just doing my duty, sheriff.

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:19.952
You and that itchy
trigger finger of yours.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:30.003
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Sure did, Trigger.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:33.423
There's something funny
going on around here. Come on.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.884
You cover me.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:44.268
Wait a minute.
Is the safety on Old Betsy?

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:47.104
- You bet it is, sheriff.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:48.855
You go first.

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:55.737
All right, you in there,
come out with your hands up.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.489
Yeah, reach for the sky.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:01.285
Just you watch this
performance, partner.

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:02.578
Be careful, Rob.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:09.835
Jehoshaphat, Trigger.
Put that peashooter down.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.589
Shucks, Trigger, it's only Nutsy.

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:16.841
And criminently,
get back to your patrol.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.886
- On the double. Get!
- I'm a-getting! I'm a-getting!

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.057
That Trigger.
He's getting everybody edgy.

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.602
Nothing's gonna happen.
That fat friar

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:30.522
is gonna dangle from
the gallows come daybreak.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:33.649
Sheriff,

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:38.196
why don't you just sit yourself
down here, kind of cosy-like?

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.573
Well, thank you, Nutsy.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.453
Just close your sleepy
little eyeballs.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.538
The sandman's a-coming.

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:53.295
Why don't you let me loosen that belt?

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.423
Rock-a-bye, sheriff

01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:59.051
Just you relax

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:23.325
Nutsy, that's mighty sweet.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.493
Sing it one more time, would you?

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:28.580
Rock-a-bye, sheriff

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.582
Just you relax

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:45.263
Wait a minute!
Jailbreak! Jailbreak!

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:48.767
I heard it! I heard it, sheriff!
The door! The door!

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:55.607
Now, for the last time,
no more false alarms.

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:59.194
Now, you release Friar Tuck
and the others,

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:01.279
and I'll drop in
on the royal treasury.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.127
Little John, it can't be!

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:18.046
Quiet. We're busting out of here.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.506
Thank God.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.551
My prayers have been answered.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:45.615
- I'm ready. Where's the bad guys?
- Take it easy, son.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:40.378
Robin Hood!
I'll get even. I'll get...

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.748
It's Robin Hood I... I want...

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:13.847
Praise the Lord
and pass the tax rebate!

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:19.144
Come on. Follow me.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.165
Now, sheriff...
Now, don't get your dander up,

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.209
but I still got a feeling that...

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:47.172
Friar, get going. Hurry.

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:54.239
Guards! Guards! My gold!

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:06.001
No, no, no.

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:08.294
They're getting away
with my gold.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:12.924
Guards! Guards! To the jail!

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.969
Rhinos, halt! Stop! Desist!

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:23.727
Everybody, this way!

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:02.140
That's all of them. Get going.

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:09.773
This ain't no hayride.
Let's move it out of here.

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:15.320
On to Sherwood Forest!

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.322
Stop! My baby!

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.949
Mama, Mama, wait for me.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.926
- We got him now!
- Keep going. Don't worry about me.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.966
This time, we got him for sure.

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:53.751
Shoot him!

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:10.268
Kill him! Kill him!

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:24.616
Come on, Rob. Come on.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:27.285
He's just gotta make it.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.961
No! No. No.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:40.256
Hiss, he's finished! Done for!

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:49.307
He's gonna make it,
isn't he, Little John?

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.078
Hey, what's that?

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.583
Little John, look it! Look it!

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:20.213
Hey, what the...

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.051
Man, did you have me worried, Rob.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:29.264
- I thought you were long gone.
- Not Robin Hood.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:35.311
He could've swum twice that far,
huh, Mr Robin Hood, sir?

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:39.816
Look, sire! Look!
He's made it. He got away again.

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:43.152
A pox on that
phoney King of England!

01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:49.575
Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.286
Well, I tried to tell you,

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.454
but, no, no, no,
you wouldn't listen.

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:55.290
Your traps just never work.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:58.209
And now look what you've done
to your mother's castle.

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.963
Mommy!

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.219
- Sire, no!
- You cowardly cobra!

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:10.555
Please! Oh, no!

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:13.558
Procrastinating python!

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:19.480
- Aggravating asp!
- Save me!

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:22.400
You eel in snake's clothing!

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:26.904
Help! He's gone stark raving mad!

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:45.673
You know,
I thought we'd never get rid

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:47.008
of those two rascals,

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:50.470
but lucky for us folks,
King Richard returned,

01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:53.598
and, well, he just
straightened everything out.

01:21:06.945 --> 01:21:08.696
Say, we'd better get over to the church.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:10.698
Sounds like somebody's
getting hitched.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:17.163
Long live Robin Hood!

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.671
Long live King Richard!

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.008
Friar Tuck,

01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:33.805
it appears that I now have
an outlaw for an in-law.

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:37.141
Yes, not bad.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:45.233
Gee, Skippy,
how come you're going?

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:48.236
Well, Robin Hood's
gonna have kids,

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.988
so somebody's gotta keep
their eye on things.

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:01.874
I've never been so happy.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:22.145
Hey, here comes the bride, Trigger.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:25.481
Present arms!

01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:36.284
Well, folks,

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.661
that's the way
it really happened.

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:44.625
Love goes on and on

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.713
Golly, what a day

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:55.344
Golly, what a day
