00:02.089 --> 00:03.612
<i>Previously on "Resident Alien"...</i>

00:03.612 --> 00:04.700
Hi, Dad.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.484
This is my sweet
little girl, Iva.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.790
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.009
You know, your mother
and I were talking,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.880
and there's a lot
of very interesting

00:10.880 --> 00:12.055
possibilities in Park City.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.840
<i>I met my mother today.</i>

00:14.840 --> 00:15.885
Can I help you?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.017
Well, how did it go?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.366
D'Arcy.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.497
<i>Do you think
you've been abducted?</i>

00:19.497 --> 00:21.412
How would someone
know for sure?

00:21.412 --> 00:23.893
<i>Some people find
chips that aliens</i>

00:23.893 --> 00:25.634
<i>use as a tracking device.</i>

00:25.634 --> 00:27.940
<i>What brings you
to this neck of the woods?</i>

00:27.940 --> 00:30.769
I'm here to kill my father.

00:30.769 --> 00:31.770
You must know chemistry.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.076
You recognize this formula?

00:33.076 --> 00:35.035
<i>It is a compound
with an alien element.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:39.169
<i>This formula may be the key to
understanding the Greys' plan.</i>

00:39.169 --> 00:40.214
What is going on?

00:40.214 --> 00:41.519
Why are you being so secretive?

00:41.519 --> 00:43.347
Why are you being
so inquisitive?

00:43.347 --> 00:45.045
You and Liv practically
begged me for a new deputy,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.047
but now he's gone, and you
haven't even replaced him?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.352
No.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.050
<i>I have seen this
in human movies.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:51.312
<i>I am in love.</i>

00:51.312 --> 00:52.791
<i>You work for the Greys now.</i>

00:52.791 --> 00:56.099
<i>You are gonna help us
get Harry's alien DNA.</i>

00:56.099 --> 00:58.188
Once you give me what I need,
you will leave the planet,

00:58.188 --> 00:59.798
and you will never
see him again.

01:01.148 --> 01:05.108
<i>♪ Oh, to the future</i>

01:05.108 --> 01:09.373

01:09.373 --> 01:12.115

hope is also dead now.</i>

02:01.077 --> 02:03.862
<i>Love is like being
shot out of a cannon--</i>

02:03.862 --> 02:06.343
<i>thrilling, except for
that very last part</i>

02:06.343 --> 02:08.476
<i>when you hit the ground

02:08.476 --> 02:10.739

02:10.739 --> 02:12.654

chains, those chains ♪</i>

02:21.010 --> 02:22.316
You know what
I just realized?

02:22.316 --> 02:24.274
This song has
repeated three times.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.711
And then I asked
myself, who would

02:26.711 --> 02:29.366
be listening to a
1970s heartbreak song

02:29.366 --> 02:31.803
over and over again?

02:31.803 --> 02:34.458
And now, here I am.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.635
This song is the
truest one ever written.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.463
Can you please make it stop?

02:39.463 --> 02:42.292
I'm sorry about Heather,
but we have a lot

02:42.292 --> 02:43.641
of patients this morning.

02:43.641 --> 02:47.167
I do not care whether
they live or die!

02:47.167 --> 02:49.647
Maybe you keep that inside.

02:49.647 --> 02:53.825
And then go home and
finish the bomb, please.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.480
OK, first up,
Mayor Ben for therapy.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.267
I do not care
if Mayor Ben dies.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
Well, that makes two of us.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.226
Ha.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.663
He was joking.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.230
I wasn't.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.267
Oh, shit!

03:44.267 --> 03:46.008
Oh.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.333
It's-- it's delicate.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.553
There's this guy
at work that I'm having

04:09.553 --> 04:11.251
a bit of a problem with.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.514
Sheriff Mike.

04:13.514 --> 04:16.256
No, it's not.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.648
If it is not
Sheriff Mike,

04:17.648 --> 04:19.824
then it is Timmy
the sandwich guy.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.565
And if you cannot
get along with him,

04:21.565 --> 04:25.134
then you are a real dick.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.483
OK, it's Mike.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.790
Yeah, he's--
he's up to something.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.095
Hmm.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.663
You know, he's lying
and sneaking around.

04:32.663 --> 04:35.144
And I'm pretty sure the
new deputy he made me hire

04:35.144 --> 04:36.537
is a murderer.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.539
Don't trust anyone.

04:38.539 --> 04:43.326
You can never truly know
how another man feels--

04:43.326 --> 04:47.591
a woman, bird.

04:47.591 --> 04:51.595
You could wake up every
morning next to Sheriff Mike.

04:51.595 --> 04:54.076
He could tell you he
loves you, and you

04:54.076 --> 04:56.470
will never know if he does.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.908
<i>He could caress your face, and
you could hand-feed sunflower</i>

04:59.908 --> 05:01.866
<i>seeds into his
delicate little mouth</i>

05:01.866 --> 05:03.346
<i>while he says he wants
to spend the rest</i>

05:03.346 --> 05:07.481
<i>of his life with you,
but it could all be a lie.</i>

05:07.481 --> 05:11.354
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.704
That could be a lie.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.099
Thank you for that image.

05:17.099 --> 05:21.190
You only have yourself in
this world and no one else.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.497
You owe me $100.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.848
Oh, I see.

05:26.848 --> 05:30.895
You're saying I'm giving Mike
the power in the relationship.

05:30.895 --> 05:34.769
I need to find out what's
going on, take my power back.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.684
I didn't say any of that.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.121
You know,
you have a strange method,

05:39.121 --> 05:40.775
but I'm starting to get it.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.038
You say the wrong thing for
me to learn the right thing.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.345
- Wrong.
- Right.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.999
Great session.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.350
Turn off the light!

05:50.350 --> 05:51.612
Son of a bitch.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.922
Harry, God damn it!

05:57.922 --> 06:01.796
That's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.321
Not something you want to
hear in a doctor's office.

06:05.321 --> 06:08.498
Hi.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.370
Mary Ellen.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.328
I know.

06:13.677 --> 06:18.290
I wanted to say
sorry for how I was.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.162
I wasn't in the best place.

06:20.162 --> 06:23.339
There was some things going on.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.863
It doesn't matter.

06:25.863 --> 06:29.693
Want to know about your
family, your history?

06:29.693 --> 06:32.653
Maybe we grab some food
and talk?

06:36.134 --> 06:37.788
Um.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.883
Sir, we have a problem.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.669
I did that trick you
taught me about putting

06:48.669 --> 06:50.801
a hair on my lunch bag
in the refrigerator

06:50.801 --> 06:52.847
to see if anyone's touched
it, but with our murder

06:52.847 --> 06:55.110
investigation board,
and they did.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.248
Are you saying
you've been putting

07:03.248 --> 07:05.512
your hair in the refrigerator?

07:05.512 --> 07:08.515
It was your technique.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.734
You said you put
your hair on your--

07:10.734 --> 07:12.867
I said I put
my hair on my lunch.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.608
I didn't say put
your hair on your lunch.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.523
That's unsanitary.

07:16.523 --> 07:19.526
And did you hear the part I
said about our murder board?

07:19.526 --> 07:21.571
I hear everything, deputy.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.573
I'm like a fennec fox.

07:23.573 --> 07:24.618
Look it up.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.271
It's cute as hell.

07:26.271 --> 07:29.536
Well, I'd say the fact that
he's been asking questions

07:29.536 --> 07:33.148
about our movements tells
me that our likely spy

07:33.148 --> 07:35.933
is the mayor.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.979
Plus the fact that he's
spying on us right now.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.679
No, it's fine.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.159
He don't have nothing.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.639
If he asks, we'll just
say that board's part

07:45.639 --> 07:47.945
of a game we're playing,
a murder mystery

07:47.945 --> 07:50.774
called the
"Alien Trackers Van."

07:50.774 --> 07:53.516
Yeah, part of the
"Sheriff Mike's Murder

07:53.516 --> 07:55.126
Mystery Game" series, right?

07:55.126 --> 07:59.261
And the next one is
"Sheriff Mike and the Secret

07:59.261 --> 08:00.915
of the Old Sawmill."

08:00.915 --> 08:01.959
OK.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.874
But on the other
thing, you said

08:03.874 --> 08:06.616
you'd found another chemist we
can talk to about the formula

08:06.616 --> 08:10.315
from Robert's notebook.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.230
You said we.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.232
Are you back on
this thing with me?

08:14.232 --> 08:15.799
Yes, sir.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.280
I don't want to let
being afraid stop

08:18.280 --> 08:20.064
me from doing what's right.

08:20.064 --> 08:23.851
If I can put my nana in the
hospital, I can do anything.

08:23.851 --> 08:24.634
Mm.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.114
How's she doing?

08:26.114 --> 08:27.681
I haven't asked.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.988
Anyway, I have kind of a
crazy plan to catch Joseph.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.816
Yeah, well, whatever
it is, with the mayor

08:32.816 --> 08:37.168
watching us all the time,
it's gonna be a lot harder.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.827
Be a little harder.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.357
Liza?

08:52.357 --> 08:54.534
Hello, Dad.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.623
Hey.

08:56.623 --> 09:01.802
Um, now is not a very
good time for a visit.

09:01.802 --> 09:06.633
Maybe you can come back
when it's warmer outside

09:06.633 --> 09:09.200
and we can throw a ball.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.639
So you want to
send me away again?

09:12.639 --> 09:14.510
No, I did not send
you away the first time.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.512
I put you on a nice bus.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.167
I even gave you my last apple.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.561
You couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.128
Ah!

09:24.128 --> 09:26.348
Liza, you are
being very naughty.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.611
If you do not stop
throwing knives at Daddy,

09:28.611 --> 09:30.134
I will limit your screen time.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.222
It was freezing there.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.224
You didn't even
pack me a sweater.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.793
Ah!

09:36.793 --> 09:38.534
There's something
different about you.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.319
Ah!

09:41.319 --> 09:42.320
Bridget.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.279
My baby, it's you.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.454
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

09:45.454 --> 09:47.630
I like your new skin.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.371
Augh!

09:49.371 --> 09:50.764
Well, you broke my nose.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.114
- Ah!
- Ooh!

09:53.114 --> 09:55.203
Bridget!
Oh!

09:55.203 --> 09:56.334
So strong now.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.945
My big, strong baby.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.338
And you've learned to
recreate Liza's clothing.

10:00.338 --> 10:01.862
Daddy is so proud.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.952
You're the worst father
ever, and I hate you.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.128
Oh, you want me dead?

10:08.346 --> 10:11.654
OK.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.177
No, not yet.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.526
I have something else
planned for you first,

10:14.526 --> 10:15.615
something worse than death.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.659
What is it?

10:16.659 --> 10:20.228
I guess you'll see.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.577
Hey, you left your--

10:21.577 --> 10:22.665
your hat.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.494
That's a free hat for me.

10:27.670 --> 10:28.845
Ugh.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.159
Oh, hi.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.380
Oh, thank you.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.601
Oh, my god,
I have to pee so bad.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.473
Oh, and notice I didn't ask
why you're cuffed to the bed.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.519
That is something
a mature person would do,

10:50.519 --> 10:51.563
and I want credit.

10:51.563 --> 10:52.913
Yeah, I noticed.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.610
Thanks for that.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.785
It's nothing weird.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.266
It's-- it's not a sex thing.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.659
Actually,
the sex version would

10:59.659 --> 11:01.399
be the not weird explanation.

11:01.399 --> 11:04.576
Well, maybe sometimes
you just love your bed

11:04.576 --> 11:06.491
so much you don't want
to be taken from it.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.026
I mean, honestly, it's-- it's
too crazy to even talk about.

11:19.026 --> 11:22.029
It's-- but I'm fine.

11:22.029 --> 11:27.034
Yeah, right.

11:27.034 --> 11:30.167
I'll just say, you're,
like, the least crazy

11:30.167 --> 11:32.300
person I know in the world.

11:32.300 --> 11:38.306
So maybe whatever's happening
to you, it's not so crazy.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.397
Just stay open.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.052
That's all.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.532
Yeah, yeah.

11:47.532 --> 11:48.925
Sure.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.885
Hey, dickhead!

11:54.191 --> 11:55.976
I need your help.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.674
My baby Bridget is back.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.719
Cool.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.807
You two have fun.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.373
No, no, it is not fun.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.158
He wants me dead.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.725
Sucks to be you.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.118
That's why I need your help.

12:08.118 --> 12:11.252
Hey, it's going
to be exciting, huh?

12:11.252 --> 12:14.777
Two-- two good friends
on an adventure.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.997
You only want my help
because I can see aliens.

12:16.997 --> 12:17.998
What?

12:17.998 --> 12:19.521
You can do that?

12:19.521 --> 12:22.263
What a useful skill
for my good friend to have.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.743
Do you even care
I got grounded

12:23.743 --> 12:25.048
over the science fair?

12:25.048 --> 12:27.355
Because you stole my caldera.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.096
I should be the angry one.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.750
You're lucky I need you.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.360
Yeah, like always.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.231
And after you get
what you need,

12:34.231 --> 12:35.537
it's like I'm not
even alive,

12:35.537 --> 12:39.019
which makes you
the D-I-C-K head.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.064
Fine, where is it?

12:41.064 --> 12:42.326
I know you have it.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.285
Ah, ha-ha.

12:44.285 --> 12:47.201
All right, if you are not going
to help me track an alien,

12:47.201 --> 12:49.420
then you are not
the alien tracker.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.465
Keep it.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.206
I don't care.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.947
I wish you never
came to Patience.

12:55.905 --> 12:59.169
Ah.

12:59.169 --> 13:02.042
So you said you had
information about my family?

13:02.042 --> 13:05.045
I've never really
been a family person.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.916
You know, I didn't
want to spit in a tube

13:06.916 --> 13:10.572
or chase down cousins, but I
know it's different for you.

13:10.572 --> 13:14.141
And I think I have
what you want.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.581
Ah.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.150
Um, is there a problem?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.674
I hate to bring this up,
but getting this together

13:25.674 --> 13:27.763
was a lot of work--

13:27.763 --> 13:31.071
photocopies, phone calls,
two trips to the courthouse,

13:31.071 --> 13:34.988
took the day off work
to drive up here, gas.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.859
I'm saying there are expenses.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.426
They add up.

13:38.426 --> 13:41.124
I bet.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.865
You happen to know how high?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.998
750 bucks.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.744
<i>I had a bad feeling.</i>

13:52.744 --> 13:55.660
<i>I only get bad feelings
about bad people.</i>

13:55.660 --> 13:58.968
<i>And since my job only
puts me with bad people,</i>

13:58.968 --> 14:01.753
<i>I feel bad all the time.</i>

14:02.406 --> 14:03.973
<i>So can you blame
a guy for needing</i>

14:03.973 --> 14:05.714
<i>a drink every now and then?</i>

14:07.368 --> 14:10.545
Hot.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.025
He still there?

14:12.025 --> 14:13.330
No, no, don't look.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.897
Feel it with your third eye.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.987
I'm sorry, I already looked
with my first two eyes.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.684
He's there.

14:19.684 --> 14:22.209
<i>A guy could tail people
all day hoping one of them</i>

14:22.209 --> 14:23.645
<i>will surprise him.</i>

14:23.645 --> 14:25.603
<i>And by the end
of that day, all he'd have</i>

14:25.603 --> 14:28.389
is a hat full
of disappointment and gum

14:28.389 --> 14:30.652
<i>on the bottom of his shoe.</i>

14:30.652 --> 14:34.264
<i>Oh, gumshoe.
I get it.</i>

14:40.009 --> 14:41.663
Hello, Ben Hawthorne.

14:41.663 --> 14:44.579
<i>Yes, Mr. Hawthorne, I'm
afraid your son Max has caused</i>

14:44.579 --> 14:46.537
<i>quite the problem down
here at school today,</i>

14:46.537 --> 14:48.888
<i>and we need you to
pick him up right away.</i>

14:48.888 --> 14:50.193
Now?

14:50.193 --> 14:52.369
Well, his mom works there.
Can't she do it?

14:52.369 --> 14:54.154
Yes, yes, she is here now.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.025
She says that she
needs you to come, too.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.810
The trouble is so bad, OK?

14:58.810 --> 15:00.725
- OK, I'll be right there.
- Thank you.

15:00.725 --> 15:01.726
Bye-bye.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.946
Yep.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.827
And there he goes.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.660
He's got plenty of room.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.969
- Oh.
- And now he's coming back.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.623
Maybe he forgot something.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.190
It's like he's
pulling away backwards

15:30.190 --> 15:32.932
so he can come in forwards.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
This is bad.

15:34.411 --> 15:37.110
Hell, I saw a coked-out
squirrel driving a tricycle

15:37.110 --> 15:39.329
that drive better than that.

15:55.519 --> 15:59.784
You, get me all the alcohol!

15:59.784 --> 16:05.790
I am Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle,
the biggest drunk in town!

16:08.358 --> 16:10.143
Jesus Christ.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.845
<i>♪ Do you really
really love me ♪</i>

16:16.845 --> 16:21.545
I will take this, because
I am Harry Vanderspeigle.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.373
And I am selfish.

16:23.373 --> 16:27.160
And I send children
away without any snacks.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.944
And I--

16:28.944 --> 16:32.556
that is inexcusable.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.082
<i>♪ This is gonna be trouble</i>

16:41.130 --> 16:42.131
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.351
Psst.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.743
What are you doing?

16:45.743 --> 16:47.528
I was having drinks.

16:47.528 --> 16:51.401
It's not my first,
because I'm an adult human.

16:51.401 --> 16:52.794
I drink alcohol.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.796
My stomach is so warm.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.712
I am sorry about
your bird,

16:57.712 --> 16:59.714
but you need to snap out of it.
OK?

16:59.714 --> 17:01.803
You got shit to do.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.632
You look good.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.679
Do you know the Greys
are taking Kate, too?

17:08.679 --> 17:10.116
This shit is getting worse.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.074
I'd fix it myself, but I can't.

17:12.074 --> 17:16.122
I've got to rely
on you to do something.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.471
- Hey, whoa.

17:17.471 --> 17:20.648
Ohh, ugh.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.780
I did it.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.478
Why do I feel like fighting?

17:25.696 --> 17:27.307
Keep it.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.570
What?

17:29.570 --> 17:31.833
Mom, sorry.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.098
Where is he?

17:36.098 --> 17:38.840
Is your mother a beaver?

17:38.840 --> 17:45.238
Because damn, girl.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.935
For someone
who's not adopted,

17:46.935 --> 17:48.371
it's hard to understand.

17:48.371 --> 17:52.114
It's-- you know your story.

17:52.114 --> 17:55.683
It starts way back somewhere
and-- and moves forward

17:55.683 --> 17:57.946
like chapters in a novel.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.861
And at some point,
you show up in it.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.950
But me, it's like
the pages before me

18:01.950 --> 18:04.431
were torn out of the book,
and Mary Ellen has them.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.564
And she's gonna sell them
to you, and that's wrong.

18:07.564 --> 18:11.133
And if you pay her,
she's never gonna go away.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.440
She's gonna keep coming back.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.095
And that would be--

18:16.095 --> 18:17.531
Bad.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.575
Right.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.621
There you are.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.798
Are either one of you going
to kick me in the nipple?

18:23.798 --> 18:26.540
I mean, I wasn't, but now
it's all I can think about.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.889
What happened?

18:27.889 --> 18:30.283
I heard you got banned
from Mama Sap's.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.240
What?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.721
The cheese comes from her toes.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.375
Stay away!

18:35.375 --> 18:38.160
<i>This is what the little shit
meant by worse than death.</i>

18:38.160 --> 18:41.120
<i>He is going to
destroy my life here.</i>

18:41.120 --> 18:42.947
What's going on with you?

18:42.947 --> 18:47.038
I have not been
a strong enough parent.

18:47.038 --> 18:50.781
<i>I'm going to do some
nipple kicking of my own.</i>

18:57.484 --> 18:58.876
Mom.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.095
Hey, how is he?

19:00.095 --> 19:03.272
Not good.
Look at him.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.100
His heart stopped.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.190
He just keeled over, spilled
his M&Ms all over the place,

19:08.190 --> 19:10.236
and then they had
to start him up

19:10.236 --> 19:12.586
right there in the hotel room.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.109
It was awful.

19:14.109 --> 19:17.721
What-- what are you
doing in Colorado?

19:17.721 --> 19:18.983
My cousin Louisa's birthday.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.420
You remember her.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.248
No, sorry.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.423
Cousin Louisa?

19:23.423 --> 19:24.467
Yeah, I heard you.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.295
I just don't remember.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.775
Cousin Louisa.

19:27.775 --> 19:28.819
I don't know her.

19:28.819 --> 19:29.951
Shh.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.083
You'll disturb your father.

19:33.650 --> 19:37.001
I sure wish I could find that
nurse with the ice chips.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.916
I think we can wait
until he wakes up.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.049
They're not for him.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.008
Oh.

19:44.008 --> 19:47.838
You could at least
apologize for being late.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.580
Excuse me, is there...

19:50.580 --> 19:53.453
Bullshit.

19:53.453 --> 19:56.412
Dad.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.587
How are you feeling?

19:57.587 --> 19:59.328
I should be the
one apologizing to you

19:59.328 --> 20:02.244
for telling you to live
your life a different way.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.854
This must be some good drugs.

20:03.854 --> 20:06.814
You know, once on TV, in
one of your World Cup races,

20:06.814 --> 20:11.819
they showed what the skier
sees at the top of the hill.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.299
Ah.

20:13.299 --> 20:17.651
Cliff of sheer ice,
and you just drop off it.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.480
Fearless.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.656
Such bravery.

20:24.832 --> 20:28.357
You're my hero.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.924
I'm your hero?

20:29.924 --> 20:33.188
You're everything
that I wasn't in my life.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.972
I had things I wanted to do.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.192
Of course I did.

20:37.192 --> 20:41.414
I took the safe way, no risks.

20:41.414 --> 20:44.243
Not you.

20:44.243 --> 20:49.117
How would you feel if, um,
I didn't have any more races?

20:49.117 --> 20:53.034
Ah, then you'd do
something else great.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.558
I'll meet you at the
bottom of that hill too.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.749
<i>I liked my baby
better when he</i>

21:12.749 --> 21:13.750
<i>was sweet and not so murder-y.</i>

21:13.750 --> 21:15.186
<i>I do not understand.</i>

21:15.186 --> 21:17.754
<i>I gave him a good life,
a freezing-cold planet</i>

21:17.754 --> 21:20.148
<i>to live on where he could
run and play and try</i>

21:20.148 --> 21:21.889
<i>to kill other children.</i>

21:21.889 --> 21:22.977
<i>What does he do?</i>

21:22.977 --> 21:25.458
<i>Tries to stab me with a knife.</i>

21:25.458 --> 21:26.807
<i>The little scamp.</i>

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
Hello, Harry.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.507
Ah!

21:31.507 --> 21:32.769
Oh, my gosh,
what is wrong with you?

21:32.769 --> 21:34.945
You are not Max's friend.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.599
She was sent away
to girl's prison.

21:36.599 --> 21:37.644
Gifted school.

21:37.644 --> 21:38.819
And I'm back.

21:38.819 --> 21:39.950
How do I know it is you?

21:39.950 --> 21:41.517
How do I know it's you?

21:41.517 --> 21:44.172
Oh, wait, because there
can't be two murdering space

21:44.172 --> 21:46.130
jerks this stupid in one town.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.784
Oh, yes, it is you.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.960
You were not missed.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.224
Why do you have Max's taser?

21:53.224 --> 21:57.272
Because my baby Bridget is
back, and he is acting out.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.273
He's back?

21:58.273 --> 21:59.143
Where?

21:59.143 --> 22:00.449
I missed him so much.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.842
<i>Yes, I forgot.</i>

22:01.842 --> 22:03.539
<i>The baby loves this one.</i>

22:03.539 --> 22:05.236
<i>He will come to her.</i>

22:05.236 --> 22:06.455
Yes.

22:06.455 --> 22:07.978
He misses you, too.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.851
Yeah, talks about
you all the time.

22:10.851 --> 22:14.594
You can soothe
his angry, angry mind.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.291
Let us find him together.

22:16.291 --> 22:19.990
I'll help you,
but only to keep him safe.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.514
I don't trust you.

22:21.514 --> 22:25.300
<i>I will use her as bait,
and she will never know.</i>

22:25.300 --> 22:27.041
You're not gonna
use me as bait.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.651
<i>How does she know
what I'm thinking?</i>

22:28.651 --> 22:30.871
I knew you were thinking that
because you're a simpleton,

22:30.871 --> 22:34.004
and you say the first thought
that enters your stupid head.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.005
<i>I hate her.</i>

22:35.005 --> 22:36.180
I know, you hate me.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.878
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la

22:37.878 --> 22:39.140
♪ I am singing this
song in my head ♪

22:39.140 --> 22:40.794
♪ So she cannot read my mind

22:40.794 --> 22:42.056
That was out loud.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.449
<i>Damn it.</i>

22:52.501 --> 22:56.505
Um, hope a check is OK.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.551
Mm.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.862
Is my dad in here?

23:05.862 --> 23:07.168
Uh, no, that's just my side.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.431
I never was in touch
with his family.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.693
Oh, OK.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.042
Well, maybe you could
tell me who they are,

23:12.042 --> 23:13.392
and then I could go from there.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.263
If you're interested
in things of his,

23:15.263 --> 23:17.700
I have a desk that he left
behind, never got rid of.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.269
Yeah, or you could
just tell me his name.

23:21.269 --> 23:24.794
I could write it down,
put it in the desk.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.146
And sell it to me?

23:29.146 --> 23:30.713
It's a nice desk.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.851
Forget it.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.679
I thought you said you wanted
to know where you came from.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.332
Now I do.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.117
You're better than me,
is that right?

23:43.117 --> 23:44.205
Probably.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.599
Because I gave up a kid?

23:46.599 --> 23:49.645
So did you, as I recall.

23:49.645 --> 23:52.605
Yeah, but I did it for her.

23:52.605 --> 23:55.434
You did it for you.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.051
Coffee's on you.

24:09.796 --> 24:14.104
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:14.104 --> 24:17.281
You know that book,
"Are You My Mother?"

24:17.281 --> 24:19.458
Little baby bird goes
around asking everything

24:19.458 --> 24:22.548
it sees if they're its mother.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.506
I hated that book.

24:24.506 --> 24:29.380
Because, for me,
I knew the answer

24:29.380 --> 24:30.947
was always gonna be no.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.344
And right now, I just want
to tell little me that there

24:36.344 --> 24:38.520
are worse answers than no.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.959
I didn't like
"Winnie the Pooh."

24:44.744 --> 24:47.790
I'm sorry. I just thought
I should say something.

25:05.591 --> 25:06.983
Wait here, deputy.

25:06.983 --> 25:09.812
I'll go talk to the chemist.

25:27.047 --> 25:30.964
Drop it.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.579
Ha-ha-ha.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.450
This the notebook
you're looking for?

25:39.450 --> 25:41.148
Yes.

25:43.411 --> 25:44.717
Wow, that was good.

25:44.717 --> 25:47.676
Your reflexes
seem almost non-human.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.982
I will shoot her.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.201
Drop it.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.116
Drop the gun
or drop the notebook?

25:53.116 --> 25:54.857
The notebook.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.250
Both, actually.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.862
Good.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.429
Kick it over here.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.170
Kick the gun
or kick the notebook?

26:03.170 --> 26:04.563
Both.
Jesus.

26:18.446 --> 26:21.275
Just-- just pick
it up, throw it.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.239
What is the formula for?

26:29.239 --> 26:31.459
Dr. Vanderspeigle
broke it down for us.

26:31.459 --> 26:32.939
If it ends up in
the wrong hands,

26:32.939 --> 26:35.202
it could change how ice
cream is eaten forever.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.421
Fine, don't tell me.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.162
I'll just go in there,
talk to the chemist

26:39.162 --> 26:40.947
myself, get him to
give me some answers.

26:40.947 --> 26:41.948
There is no chemist.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.123
We set you up.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.080
Chemists don't work at night.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.778
Everybody know that.

26:45.778 --> 26:46.953
Everybody does not know that,
because that is not a thing.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.084
You said him.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.303
The chemist could be a her.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.609
That's misogynistic.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.914
You said there
was no chemist.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.047
But if there was.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.919
I can't be misogynistic about
a person that does not exist.

26:56.919 --> 26:58.094
Oh, hell yeah, you can.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.356
The whole world's a landmine.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.576
Well, too bad
there is no chemist.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.839
Because now I'm gonna have
to kill you for no reason.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.410
Get in!

27:09.410 --> 27:11.238
What the hell are you doing?

27:11.238 --> 27:12.674
I'm saving your ass
is what I'm doing.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.110
You could probably
slow down now.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.459
I don't do great
in the back seat.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.070
No way.
He might be following us.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.724
I know half his ass is,
because it's in the bumper.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.551
I think I smell blood
coming through the vent.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.944
Yeah, put it on recirculate.
Do the recirculate.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.337
I don't know where that is.
It's not my car.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.468
- What?
- Whose car is it?

27:24.468 --> 27:25.905
It's Deborah, the town clerk.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.254
You stole Deborah's car?

27:27.254 --> 27:28.908
No I borrowed
her keys after you

27:28.908 --> 27:31.258
tried to ditch me today with
that stupid Russian accent.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.694
You should run it
through a car wash

27:32.694 --> 27:33.739
before you give it back.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.871
Oh, my god!

27:35.871 --> 27:37.873
You made me hire a killer,
and I kill the killer.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.962
And now I'm the killer!
- I didn't do that.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.398
Yes!

27:41.398 --> 27:42.399
No, if you could
pull over for a second

27:42.399 --> 27:43.705
so I can throw up.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.359
Do not throw up
in Deborah's car.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.316
Oh, that's right.

27:46.316 --> 27:47.666
It's not my car.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.102
Now I can pin this on Deborah.
No!

27:49.102 --> 27:50.320
No!

27:50.320 --> 27:51.800
That is not who I am.
Think.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.845
Shit, shit.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.194
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.369
Maybe he's not dead.
- What?

27:55.369 --> 27:56.805
God, I sure want to be.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.677
No, no, no, no,
we have to go back and see.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.722
There might still be a chance
to clear Deborah's name.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.899
- What? No.
- Hang on.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.466
What the hell?

28:05.466 --> 28:06.946
I think I shit myself.

28:06.946 --> 28:07.990
Oh.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.471
God, it's a regular day.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.302
This is taking too long.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.130
I will make Max come
over and wrestle

28:17.130 --> 28:18.566
you so you can
start sweating and

28:18.566 --> 28:20.524
Bridget can smell your stink.

28:20.524 --> 28:24.441
Don't tell Max
I'm back yet, OK?

28:24.441 --> 28:26.966
My, my, my, my.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.619
I see you committed a crime.

28:28.619 --> 28:31.840
No, I quit that
gifted program I was in.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.974
Everyone was older,
and they were all so smart.

28:34.974 --> 28:39.282
And I was just average.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.023
I've never been average.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.764
It's like you.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.984
Here, you're smarter than most
humans, but on your planet,

28:44.984 --> 28:46.376
you're probably really dumb.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.292
No, I was
exceptional there, too.

28:49.292 --> 28:52.861
A C student at best.

28:52.861 --> 28:54.558
Ah!

28:54.558 --> 28:56.778
Oh, my gosh, baby, you're here.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.127
Bridget.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.955
Oh, I really missed you.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.784
You were probably so
scared, but I'm here now.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.221
Everything is OK.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.445
You killed him!

29:11.445 --> 29:14.753
No, we killed him.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.457
You killed your baby.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.545
No.

29:24.545 --> 29:26.199
Well, he started it.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.635
He was going to kill me.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.942
I don't even have a child,
and I know not killing

29:29.942 --> 29:31.378
it is, like, the main thing.

29:31.378 --> 29:32.814
He was broken.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.990
He didn't love me anymore.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.557
He doesn't have to love you.

29:36.557 --> 29:37.950
You're supposed to love him.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.039
That does not sound
like a good deal to me.

29:40.039 --> 29:42.258
But--

29:53.661 --> 29:55.706
Bridget?

29:55.706 --> 29:57.230
Bridget, you're back.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.319
Molecular genetic
regeneration.

29:59.319 --> 30:03.149
One of Bridget's bits
found a piece of DNA.

30:03.149 --> 30:05.412
I am very impressed
with my baby.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.722
Oh, look at that.

30:11.722 --> 30:14.334
Bridget found some more DNA.

30:14.334 --> 30:17.511
So many.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.947
Impressive.

30:28.609 --> 30:29.784

Why do you have teeth?

31:59.134 --> 32:00.919
Maybe it just
knocked him out.

32:02.050 --> 32:05.967
Knocked him out his skin, maybe.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.229
He was taken up.

32:09.188 --> 32:09.971
Up?

32:09.971 --> 32:11.451
Like to heaven?

32:11.451 --> 32:13.366
No, she means like
with one of those claws.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.063
The military has
them on helicopters.

32:15.063 --> 32:16.325
It's like the
ones in the arcade,

32:16.325 --> 32:17.718
except they're
not rigged so you

32:17.718 --> 32:18.980
can never win the damn koala.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.200
That's not what I mean.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.592
I mean by an alien spaceship.

32:22.592 --> 32:23.680
No.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.291
OK, just stop it, all right?

32:25.291 --> 32:26.683
I don't want to hear any more
of this ridiculous

32:26.683 --> 32:28.207
alien shit, OK?

32:28.207 --> 32:30.600
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go look for drag marks

32:30.600 --> 32:32.994
from a top secret invisible
military claw chopper.

32:41.002 --> 32:45.180
You really think
this was aliens?

32:45.180 --> 32:50.142
You hit him going 50 miles
per hour, and now he's gone.

32:50.142 --> 32:53.188
There's no footprints,
no blood trail.

32:53.188 --> 32:56.887
And did you see
or hear a helicopter?

32:56.887 --> 33:00.021
I think Joseph is an alien.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.850
They're real, Ben.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.505
Aliens are real,
and they abduct people,

33:05.505 --> 33:07.028
and they don't remember.

33:25.264 --> 33:26.526
Ah.

33:26.526 --> 33:30.051
Ahh! Ahh!

33:40.453 --> 33:43.369
What is that?

33:43.369 --> 33:45.414
Oh.

33:45.414 --> 33:50.637
Is that-- who put
a booger in my home?

33:57.209 --> 34:00.125
Max.

34:00.125 --> 34:04.085
I tried to kill
him so many times.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.478
I do not want
to kill him anymore.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.610
So stick him in a pod
and send him away.

34:07.610 --> 34:08.916
That's what you like to do.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.657
I did that for you.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.267
You did it for you.

34:12.267 --> 34:15.053
No, I had work to do.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.926
The future of the entire
planet depends on me.

34:18.926 --> 34:19.927
I don't care.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.015
I'm a baby.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.930
I needed you.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.540
You shoved me
in that spaceship.

34:24.540 --> 34:27.152
I thought we were
going together.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.719
<i>I needed my father.</i>

34:29.719 --> 34:33.071
Daddy.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.420
<i>I abandoned you.</i>

34:34.420 --> 34:36.770
You were abandoned
by the one you love,

34:36.770 --> 34:38.728
just like I was by Heather.

34:40.687 --> 34:42.645
I am sorry.

34:42.645 --> 34:45.039
Because your girlfriend
broke up with you?

34:45.039 --> 34:46.606
No, because--

34:46.606 --> 34:48.869
<i>What is this?</i>

34:48.869 --> 34:52.177
<i>I thought it had gone
forever when Heather left me.</i>

34:52.177 --> 34:56.137
<i>But it came back.</i>

34:56.137 --> 34:58.052
because I love you.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.621
Oh.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.668
<i>Babies do not care
what anyone feels.</i>

35:05.668 --> 35:09.629
<i>They only want to be taken
care of, to be loved...</i>

35:14.286 --> 35:16.462
<i>And to know there is
someone out there who will</i>

35:16.462 --> 35:21.206
<i>find a way to protect them.</i>

35:21.206 --> 35:23.164
<i>No matter what it takes.</i>

35:45.839 --> 35:47.145
Hey.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.494
I know it's late.

35:48.494 --> 35:49.495
Yeah.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.931
What's going on?

35:50.931 --> 35:53.673
I just wanted to say
that, um, I'm happy for you

35:53.673 --> 35:55.588
and your girlfriend.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.198
I don't remember her name,
but I hope

35:57.198 --> 36:00.201
that she has a great life
and that you

36:00.201 --> 36:01.202
have a great life.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.683
But I've got to go.

36:03.683 --> 36:06.120
D'Arcy, are you OK?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.165
Come inside.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.427
I'm not on anything.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.037
Just my dad's in the hospital.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.518
He's gonna be fine, but he--

36:12.518 --> 36:17.610
he's-- he's proud of me,
and he says I'm built to do

36:17.610 --> 36:20.395
something great,
something big,

36:20.395 --> 36:24.051
and I think I know
what that is now.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.575
And if you never
see me again, I just

36:26.575 --> 36:30.231
wanted you to know that I
know that you cared about me,

36:30.231 --> 36:36.803
and I messed it up,
and that--

36:36.803 --> 36:40.067
yeah, OK, but you're
gonna be proud of me, too.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.765
So bye.

36:42.765 --> 36:44.506
D'Arcy.

36:44.506 --> 36:49.337
D'Arcy!

37:36.863 --> 37:38.343
Good morning!

37:38.343 --> 37:40.693
Ah, good morning.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.565
I brought this for you.

37:43.565 --> 37:47.830
You can put it on your desk.

37:47.830 --> 37:51.312
Oh, that is so sweet.

37:51.312 --> 37:54.750
But no.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.143
I have some good news.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.623
OK.

37:57.623 --> 38:00.190
I stayed up late last night,
and I finished the bomb!

38:00.190 --> 38:02.192
Harry, shh.

38:02.192 --> 38:04.369
I stayed up late last night.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.675
That's not the part.

38:06.675 --> 38:07.807
Never mind.

38:07.807 --> 38:10.375
That is great news.

38:10.375 --> 38:15.554
The, uh, lady general is
going to be coming to my cabin

38:15.554 --> 38:18.644
later to hear my plan.

38:18.644 --> 38:22.604
I could use more information
about the Greys' ship layout,

38:22.604 --> 38:24.780
but I may have
enough to proceed.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.434
Thank God.
I'm glad.

38:26.434 --> 38:27.870
Mm-hmm.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.133
I'm also glad that you
have Bridget back, too.

38:30.133 --> 38:34.486
I thought I was doing
what was best for him.

38:34.486 --> 38:37.271
But I was selfish.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.968
It was for me.

38:38.968 --> 38:41.362
You know, it's not
always easy to know.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.973
Yes, like you with Jay.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.148
Why do people
keep saying this?

38:45.148 --> 38:47.194
I did not have selfish reasons.

38:47.194 --> 38:53.461
No, you made a difficult
choice to give Jay away.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.245
That was good.

38:55.245 --> 38:56.377
Thank you.

38:56.377 --> 38:58.640
I meant you are
selfish with Jay now.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.990
What?

39:00.990 --> 39:04.864
Yeah, I'm gonna
put that right there.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.040
It looks so good.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.439
Hi.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.397
Sorry, I--

39:16.397 --> 39:19.400
I don't have
an appointment, but I--

39:19.400 --> 39:22.055
I have something
in the back of my neck.

39:22.055 --> 39:25.972
And I need you to
take it out right now.

39:25.972 --> 39:28.017
<i>It is a Grey implant.</i>

39:28.017 --> 39:29.584
<i>They are taking
Mayor Snowflake,</i>

39:29.584 --> 39:31.543
<i>so it is not surprising
that they are also</i>

39:31.543 --> 39:33.545
<i>taking Mrs. Mayor Snowflake.</i>

39:33.545 --> 39:35.155
<i>This is excellent.</i>

39:35.155 --> 39:37.984
<i>I can use her to get
intel about the Grey ship.</i>

39:37.984 --> 39:38.985
You seem upset.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.987
I can calm you.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.380
Have you ever been hypnotized?

39:48.037 --> 39:50.823
You are on the Greys' ship.

39:50.823 --> 39:53.086
Tell me everything you see.

39:53.086 --> 39:56.306
They're--
they're walking with me.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.699
<i>Yes.</i>

39:57.699 --> 39:59.832
<i>Yes, how many doors are there?</i>

39:59.832 --> 40:01.442
<i>Are their guards?</i>

40:01.442 --> 40:02.661
And how many?

40:02.661 --> 40:03.836
Where is she?

40:03.836 --> 40:05.664
<i>Let me see her.</i>

40:05.664 --> 40:07.535
Who is she?

40:07.535 --> 40:09.189
Is it a guard?

40:09.189 --> 40:12.410
A leader?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.715
There she is.

40:16.588 --> 40:18.328
Oh, my sweet.

40:18.328 --> 40:19.286
There's my baby.

40:19.286 --> 40:20.679
Yeah.

40:20.679 --> 40:24.465
<i>The little bastards
took Mrs. Mayor's child.</i>

40:24.465 --> 40:26.249
<i>She would not
like to know that.</i>

40:26.249 --> 40:28.556
<i>It would make her
angry and sad.</i>

40:28.556 --> 40:33.474
<i>I will make sure she does not
remember it when she wakes up.</i>

40:33.474 --> 40:35.084
How many are there?

40:35.084 --> 40:36.869
Do they have weapons?

40:36.869 --> 40:39.437
Oh, I love her so much.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.485
They want me to bond with her.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.356
<i>I want her home--</i>

40:46.356 --> 40:47.357
It's all right.

40:47.357 --> 40:49.751
<i>with me.</i>

40:49.751 --> 40:51.013
<i>This is no help.</i>

40:51.013 --> 40:53.494
<i>She is too focused
on her baby.</i>

40:53.494 --> 40:55.148
<i>I understand.</i>

40:55.148 --> 40:57.803
<i>I would be so sad if I did
not know that my baby existed.</i>

40:57.803 --> 41:01.154
<i>And I realize now that
happiness is not just getting</i>

41:01.154 --> 41:04.810
<i>love but getting to love.</i>

41:04.810 --> 41:09.989
When I snap my fingers,
you will wake up,

41:09.989 --> 41:16.125
and you will
remember everything.

41:17.866 --> 41:21.566
3, 2, 1.

41:27.920 --> 41:31.184
Oh, no!

41:42.195 --> 41:46.591
I love you, but this is
the right thing for you.

41:46.591 --> 41:50.377
I've loved every second
of getting to act

41:50.377 --> 41:52.248
like a mom to you.

41:52.248 --> 41:55.121
But I love it so much
that I've skipped over all

41:55.121 --> 41:58.124
the parts of knowing how.

41:58.124 --> 42:00.430
I'm glad I could be part
of your learning process.

42:00.430 --> 42:02.128
I know you're mad,
but you should

42:02.128 --> 42:04.347
be here right now with
the people who raised you,

42:04.347 --> 42:06.045
and you know it.

42:06.045 --> 42:09.352
It would have been nice if it
was my choice for once, Asta.

42:09.352 --> 42:11.529
I'm a person.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.791
I should have a say.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.314
I agree.

42:14.314 --> 42:17.491
We never even talked
about the whole thing.

42:17.491 --> 42:18.971
The whole?

42:18.971 --> 42:22.322
How you kept this a secret
from me my entire life.

42:22.322 --> 42:23.541
Right.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.326
How you hired me
just to be near me,

42:26.326 --> 42:28.850
and you still didn't tell me.

42:28.850 --> 42:32.593
I-- I was afraid.

42:36.989 --> 42:42.560
I finally got everything
I ever wanted.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.564
It was just so delicate and
fragile that if I looked at it

42:46.564 --> 42:48.348
the wrong way or
breathed on it too hard,

42:48.348 --> 42:51.003
it would break and be gone.

42:51.003 --> 42:54.223
Same.

42:54.223 --> 42:57.487
It was messed up.

42:57.487 --> 42:58.532
And I am sorry.

42:58.532 --> 43:01.491
And you are right.

43:01.491 --> 43:05.365
Let's talk about it.

43:05.365 --> 43:07.846
Now?

43:07.846 --> 43:11.632
No.

43:11.632 --> 43:14.504
That's what the rest
of our lives are for.

43:14.504 --> 43:16.028
Oh.

43:16.028 --> 43:18.030
Oh.

43:20.119 --> 43:21.337
Oh, retainer.

43:21.337 --> 43:22.382
Oh.

43:22.382 --> 43:23.557
Thanks.

43:26.342 --> 43:28.649
God.

43:30.738 --> 43:33.436
I even wrote a plan
explaining how you would

43:33.436 --> 43:35.613
get onto this ship
and destroy it,

43:35.613 --> 43:38.006
but you don't need any
of that now,

43:38.006 --> 43:40.835
because I am going to kill
the Greys myself.

43:40.835 --> 43:44.491
So I should do what, just
stay home, watch a ball game?

43:44.491 --> 43:45.927
Oh.

43:45.927 --> 43:48.887
I mean, you could come and
observe, take pictures.

43:48.887 --> 43:51.890
It will make for a nice memory.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.500
What the hell?

43:53.500 --> 43:54.588
Where is it?

43:54.588 --> 43:56.329
I do not know.

43:56.329 --> 43:59.114
Some son of a bitch
snuck in after I was asleep

43:59.114 --> 44:01.160
and stole my bomb.
