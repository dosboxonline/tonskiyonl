00:02.381 --> 00:03.417
<i>Previously on
"The Rookie"...</i>

00:03.417 --> 00:04.935
I think there's
someone in my house.

00:06.523 --> 00:08.215
I'm only gonna ask you once.
Who sent you?

00:08.215 --> 00:10.596
- Go to hell.
- I'll meet you there.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.394
<i>Charlie's starting today.</i>

00:15.394 --> 00:18.535
He's the private
security guy I hired.

00:18.535 --> 00:21.573
Mr. Evers, Charlie Bristow
from X Ring Security.

00:21.573 --> 00:24.093
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I'm sorry.

00:24.093 --> 00:25.680
<i>Nolan mentioned</i>

00:25.680 --> 00:27.682
that you might be looking
for a new roommate.

00:27.682 --> 00:30.340
My current living situation,
it really sucks.

00:30.340 --> 00:32.066
And I totally understand
if it's too soon.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.792
Just thought I'd throw it
out there just in case.

00:33.792 --> 00:35.725
I actually think
that's a really great idea.

00:35.725 --> 00:37.554
Aww.

00:45.390 --> 00:46.874
The hell
are you doing up here?

00:46.874 --> 00:48.393
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

00:48.393 --> 00:50.188
Did you compromise the op?
Who did you tell?

00:50.188 --> 00:52.086
- I can't.
- Why not?

00:52.086 --> 00:53.777
Because she knows
all my secrets.

00:53.777 --> 00:55.400
Who does?

00:55.400 --> 00:57.057
I'm sorry.

01:15.627 --> 01:17.318
Hey.

01:17.318 --> 01:19.113
What happened?

01:19.113 --> 01:21.391
Mad Dog was in a bad way
when I got here.

01:21.391 --> 01:23.842
Amped up on guilt,
confessed to being dirty.

01:23.842 --> 01:25.568
Said he flipped
because she knew his secrets.

01:25.568 --> 01:27.294
Then he jumped.
- Who's she?

01:27.294 --> 01:29.261
- Blair London.
- He used her name?

01:29.261 --> 01:31.263
No, it's clear
who he was talking about.

01:31.263 --> 01:33.127
Clear to you maybe,
but you got to be very careful

01:33.127 --> 01:34.853
making accusations
before you have proof.

01:34.853 --> 01:37.269
Hell of a thing, huh?

01:37.269 --> 01:38.960
I heard you were with him
when he went over.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.308
- You assigned to this?
- Yeah.

01:41.308 --> 01:42.654
Thought I was gonna have
a quiet evening,

01:42.654 --> 01:44.000
but the universe hates me.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.519
You're saying Mad Dog jumped?

01:45.519 --> 01:47.831
I'm not saying anything.
That's what happened.

01:47.831 --> 01:50.144
Okay, look, I'm not trying
to jam you up here, Bradford,

01:50.144 --> 01:51.697
but this needs
to be handled correctly.

01:51.697 --> 01:53.872
Your buddy just led
an operation that resulted

01:53.872 --> 01:55.874
in his entire team
being blown up.

01:55.874 --> 01:58.152
There's a lot of eyes on this.
- Understood.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.843
And Sergeant Bradford
will be forthcoming

01:59.843 --> 02:01.293
answering your questions.

02:01.293 --> 02:02.536
But first,
you're required to tell me

02:02.536 --> 02:04.538
if your line of questioning
will lead to discipline.

02:04.538 --> 02:06.540
I mean, I can't rule
that out at this point,

02:06.540 --> 02:09.508
but that's not where my head
is at, unless it should be.

02:09.508 --> 02:11.061
Asking the question
isn't prejudicial.

02:11.061 --> 02:12.373
It's something we would all do.

02:12.373 --> 02:14.168
And since you can't
rule out discipline,

02:14.168 --> 02:15.963
Sergeant Bradford
is required to have

02:15.963 --> 02:17.896
an attorney
and union rep present

02:17.896 --> 02:19.208
before being questioned.

02:19.208 --> 02:20.347
All right,
you want to play it that way,

02:20.347 --> 02:21.520
I'll meet you
back at the station

02:21.520 --> 02:23.177
when you have all your ducks
in a row.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.661
But first, you need
to answer this question now.

02:24.661 --> 02:26.353
Did you touch him?
Did he touch you?

02:26.353 --> 02:28.803
Am I gonna find your DNA
on him or his on you?

02:28.803 --> 02:30.391
Never got closer
than a few feet.

02:30.391 --> 02:32.876
Great.
Thank you.

02:34.982 --> 02:37.018
I'd watch my back with him.

02:37.018 --> 02:38.468
If he thinks he can make
a career move

02:38.468 --> 02:41.230
climbing over you, he will.

02:52.241 --> 02:53.863
Whoo!

02:53.863 --> 02:55.416
Hey, I was starting to think

02:55.416 --> 02:57.038
I should have left some stuff
in storage.

02:57.038 --> 02:58.730
We can go through it all
after shift.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.560
Uh, I'm pretty sure I have some
space in my basement locker.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.252
Knock, knock. Hey.

03:03.252 --> 03:04.839
Hey! What are you doing here?

03:04.839 --> 03:06.427
Oh, I just thought
I would come by,

03:06.427 --> 03:09.568
support my rookie
as she transitions

03:09.568 --> 03:12.433
to a new, more stable
home environment.

03:12.433 --> 03:14.608
You came to make sure
I'm not late for shift.

03:14.608 --> 03:16.230
Yes, because that would be
a poor reflection on me,

03:16.230 --> 03:18.128
and my performance review
is coming up.

03:18.128 --> 03:20.061
And you, how you doing?

03:20.061 --> 03:23.272
I'm good, mostly, I guess.

03:23.272 --> 03:25.101
There's just so much change,
you know?

03:25.101 --> 03:27.034
But maybe big change
is a good thing.

03:27.034 --> 03:29.070
I'm clearly going through
a big upheaval right now,

03:29.070 --> 03:30.624
which is hard on the psyche.

03:30.624 --> 03:32.522
But, you know,
ultimately, hopefully,

03:32.522 --> 03:35.284
um, it will be a necessary
and positive period

03:35.284 --> 03:37.803
of emotional growth, so...

03:37.803 --> 03:39.978
yeah, I'm good.

03:39.978 --> 03:41.876
Great.

03:41.876 --> 03:43.084
Lopez is calling me.

03:43.084 --> 03:44.362
Hi.

03:44.362 --> 03:46.398
Hey, something happened
to Tim last night.

03:46.398 --> 03:48.400
He's not hurt, but it looks
like he was there

03:48.400 --> 03:50.368
when Mad Dog jumped off
the roof of the hospital.

03:50.368 --> 03:52.956
Oh, my God.
both: What happened?

03:52.956 --> 03:55.062
- Uh, where--where is Tim now?
<i>- On his way to the station.</i>

03:55.062 --> 03:56.305
You know the drill.

03:56.305 --> 03:57.892
He's gonna have to answer
a lot of questions,

03:57.892 --> 03:59.618
and they won't let us near him
till he's done.

03:59.618 --> 04:03.173
But I thought you'd want
to know, despite everything.

04:03.173 --> 04:04.278
<i>Yeah, no.</i>

04:04.278 --> 04:06.142
Thank you so much
for telling me.

04:06.142 --> 04:07.661
Um, please let me know
if you hear anything else.

04:07.661 --> 04:09.007
<i>Will do.</i>

04:09.007 --> 04:10.974
What happened?

04:10.974 --> 04:13.149
Mad Dog killed himself
in front of Tim.

04:13.149 --> 04:14.909
Why?

04:14.909 --> 04:16.566
It's Tim.

04:16.566 --> 04:17.774
Hey, we just heard
what happened.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.086
You all right?

04:19.086 --> 04:20.674
<i>I'm fine,
but I need my union rep.</i>

04:20.674 --> 04:22.331
Yeah, I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

04:22.331 --> 04:23.987
He needs his union rep.

04:23.987 --> 04:26.162
Wait, John.
Uh, how did he sound?

04:26.162 --> 04:27.405
Tight.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.512
You're clearly in danger.

04:31.512 --> 04:33.169
I'm not asking you
to hide in a closet.

04:33.169 --> 04:34.653
I'm just saying
security needs to be

04:34.653 --> 04:35.999
more of a primary concern.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.760
It is.
That's why I hired you.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.866
But I lead a busy life,
and I will not live it in fear.

04:40.866 --> 04:43.938
So your job is to keep me safe
while I do my thing.

04:43.938 --> 04:46.216
Yes, ma'am. Who should I
coordinate with at the LAPD?

04:46.216 --> 04:47.770
Who's investigating
the case on you?

04:47.770 --> 04:49.875
Forget about the LAPD.

04:49.875 --> 04:51.429
I have zero confidence

04:51.429 --> 04:53.016
that they have
my best interest at heart.

04:53.016 --> 04:54.535
Makes my job harder.

04:56.399 --> 04:58.470
But that's a me problem.

04:58.470 --> 05:01.162
All right, well, we're gonna
start on our site survey

05:01.162 --> 05:03.475
and do a bug sweep
of your offices.

05:03.475 --> 05:06.685
I'll coordinate with your
assistant on scheduling.

05:21.182 --> 05:23.081
This phone is
only for emergencies.

05:23.081 --> 05:24.358
<i>Did you see the news?</i>

05:24.358 --> 05:26.153
<i>Mad Dog killed himself
last night.</i>

05:26.153 --> 05:27.879
It's one less thread
to tie up.

05:27.879 --> 05:30.088
That's horrible
and also wrong.

05:30.088 --> 05:32.262
Tim Bradford was with him
the night that he jumped,

05:32.262 --> 05:33.678
which means
we need to be worried

05:33.678 --> 05:35.058
that Mad Dog might have said
something about us.

05:35.058 --> 05:38.476
He doesn't know
about us, only you...

05:38.476 --> 05:40.098
unless you betrayed me.

05:40.098 --> 05:41.858
No, I never told him
where the information

05:41.858 --> 05:43.170
he was giving me was going.

05:43.170 --> 05:44.516
But I am exposed here,

05:44.516 --> 05:46.207
and you told me
that I would be protected.

05:46.207 --> 05:47.933
And you will be.

05:47.933 --> 05:50.833
But I have problems of my own.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.249
I still don't know
who tried to kill me.

05:53.249 --> 05:55.355
And Harper and Lopez
are going to try to pin

05:55.355 --> 05:56.873
my hit man's death on me.

05:56.873 --> 05:58.427
<i>So you need to get to work.</i>

05:58.427 --> 06:00.429
<i>Jack up the cops we have
under our thumb.</i>

06:00.429 --> 06:03.052
We need real-time intel
on where the LAPD is

06:03.052 --> 06:04.605
with these investigations.

06:04.605 --> 06:08.298
Okay, I can do that.

06:08.298 --> 06:10.749
Promise me
that this will work out.

06:10.749 --> 06:12.233
I promise.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.787
Hold it together.

06:20.794 --> 06:23.313
Yeah, I need you to come in
for a session.

06:23.313 --> 06:24.591
Yes, now.

06:24.591 --> 06:25.730
<i>Monica's the killer.</i>

06:25.730 --> 06:27.456
Can you put her
in John Doe's room?

06:27.456 --> 06:29.319
- No.
- And the autopsy?

06:29.319 --> 06:31.529
Preliminary cause of death
is stroke.

06:31.529 --> 06:32.944
But that's
what it would look like

06:32.944 --> 06:34.324
if she put an air bubble
in his IV.

06:34.324 --> 06:35.636
Oh, so you have fingerprints
on the syringe?

06:35.636 --> 06:36.948
No.

06:36.948 --> 06:38.052
Look, I know
we have work to do.

06:38.052 --> 06:39.744
But I don't buy for a second

06:39.744 --> 06:40.883
that he just happened to code

06:40.883 --> 06:42.263
during the chaos
at the hospital.

06:42.263 --> 06:44.231
She used that opportunity
to take him out.

06:44.231 --> 06:46.440
You do not have
to convince me.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.306
You have to convince
the DA's office and a jury.

06:50.306 --> 06:52.412
So any progress
on the other case,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.793
the one where Monica's
a victim, not a suspect?

06:54.793 --> 06:56.623
You mean do we know
who tried to kill her?

06:56.623 --> 06:57.934
We do not.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.142
We don't even know
if it was a hit attempt

06:59.142 --> 07:00.316
or just a home invasion.

07:00.316 --> 07:01.455
It was a hit attempt.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.836
Monica wouldn't kill the guy

07:02.836 --> 07:04.734
if it was a simple robbery
gone wrong.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.460
It's hard to establish motive
without a clear ID,

07:06.460 --> 07:07.944
and we don't have him
in any database.

07:07.944 --> 07:09.463
Keep looking.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.431
When we figure out
who attacked Monica,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.571
it'll help us understand
her motive for murder.

07:13.571 --> 07:15.780
How is Tim doing?

07:15.780 --> 07:17.954
He's being Tim
about the whole thing.

07:23.373 --> 07:25.652
All right, union rep
reporting for duty.

07:25.652 --> 07:26.929
Bring me up to speed.

07:26.929 --> 07:28.482
Who is
the investigating officer?

07:28.482 --> 07:29.621
Pearson.

07:29.621 --> 07:31.451
Not the best,
but not the worst.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.694
He's gonna try to hang this
around my neck.

07:33.694 --> 07:36.145
Department needs a scapegoat
for what went down yesterday,

07:36.145 --> 07:37.974
and now their primary candidate
is dead.

07:37.974 --> 07:39.838
At best, I'll be sidelined,

07:39.838 --> 07:42.496
which is why I need you
to take over the investigation.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.499
- Investigation into what?
- Not what, who.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.776
Okay.

07:46.776 --> 07:49.399
Blair London--
rookie police psychiatrist.

07:49.399 --> 07:51.125
I've been seeing her.
So has Aaron.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.334
I believe she had leverage
on Mad Dog,

07:53.334 --> 07:55.164
and that's why
he betrayed the Metro op,

07:55.164 --> 07:56.890
and that's why he jumped.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.961
<i>Close the door.</i>

07:58.961 --> 08:00.549
I can't stay.
I have a case.

08:00.549 --> 08:03.206
I know.
Mad Dog's suicide.

08:03.206 --> 08:05.070
I need you
to scrub the apartment

08:05.070 --> 08:06.244
and make sure there is
nothing incriminating

08:06.244 --> 08:07.866
about me in there.

08:07.866 --> 08:09.661
Mad Dog was reporting to you?
What'd you have on him?

08:09.661 --> 08:11.352
It doesn't matter now.

08:11.352 --> 08:13.216
I need to make sure he didn't
say my name before he jumped.

08:13.216 --> 08:14.528
Bradford lawyered up.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.254
It could mean
that he knows something

08:16.254 --> 08:17.738
and doesn't know who to trust.

08:17.738 --> 08:20.396
So we need to isolate
and neutralize him,

08:20.396 --> 08:22.674
because if he gives me up,

08:22.674 --> 08:26.022
the recordings from your
sessions go straight to IA.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.368
You're making a big leap.

08:27.368 --> 08:29.232
I gotta go
where the evidence takes me.

08:29.232 --> 08:31.441
People heard
arguing on the roof.

08:31.441 --> 08:34.203
Mad Dog showed none of
the classic suicide precursors,

08:34.203 --> 08:36.377
and Tim was forced
out of Metro--

08:36.377 --> 08:37.931
enough to make anybody
angry and jealous.

08:37.931 --> 08:40.416
You're guessing
as to his state of mind.

08:43.730 --> 08:45.283
I'm afraid not.

08:45.283 --> 08:47.216
Tell him what you told me.

08:47.216 --> 08:49.218
I'd rather not.

08:49.218 --> 08:52.532
People say things in sessions
that they would never act on.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.568
Emotions are elevated and--

08:54.568 --> 08:56.087
You work for the city.

08:56.087 --> 08:57.606
You have an ethical
and legal obligation

08:57.606 --> 08:59.297
to report anything that
could be seen as dangerous.

08:59.297 --> 09:00.885
I know.

09:00.885 --> 09:02.369
I've been seeing
Sergeant Bradford

09:02.369 --> 09:04.578
for a couple weeks.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.476
He came to me
with anger issues.

09:06.476 --> 09:10.066
He had a lot of resentment
about leaving Metro.

09:10.066 --> 09:12.621
- Doesn't mean he's a killer.
- No, of course not.

09:12.621 --> 09:14.864
But I witnessed
a heightened interaction

09:14.864 --> 09:17.384
between Sergeant Bradford
and Mad Dog-- Matt--

09:17.384 --> 09:19.420
in the parking garage
yesterday morning.

09:19.420 --> 09:22.803
I feel if I wasn't there
that it would have escalated.

09:22.803 --> 09:25.979
Did you see evidence
that Mad Dog was depressed?

09:27.290 --> 09:29.603
No.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.812
Bradford needs to be put
on admin leave immediately,

09:31.812 --> 09:33.296
pending further investigation.

09:33.296 --> 09:35.989
- He has important cases--
- He's dangerous.

09:35.989 --> 09:38.232
But you've always looked
the other way, haven't you?

09:38.232 --> 09:40.787
Just last month,
he was under IA investigation

09:40.787 --> 09:42.167
and drummed out of Metro,

09:42.167 --> 09:44.066
and you welcomed him back
like nothing happened.

09:44.066 --> 09:45.792
It is a failure to supervise

09:45.792 --> 09:47.794
and a failure
to put your city's needs

09:47.794 --> 09:49.727
ahead of your friendship.

09:49.727 --> 09:52.592
Keep this up, and you'll be
facing discipline.

10:02.015 --> 10:04.327
Detective Pearson.
John Nolan.

10:04.327 --> 10:07.020
I'm sure you're aware, I am--
- Union rep. Got it.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.022
You planning on staying
for Bradford's interview?

10:09.022 --> 10:10.299
Yep.

10:10.299 --> 10:12.301
Well, then
before we get started,

10:12.301 --> 10:13.543
I want to be up-front
about this.

10:13.543 --> 10:15.373
I've been on the case
for three hours,

10:15.373 --> 10:17.547
and I'm already deeply troubled
by what I've discovered.

10:17.547 --> 10:19.308
I want to hear
what you have to say,

10:19.308 --> 10:21.862
but no matter how
you answer these questions,

10:21.862 --> 10:25.383
you're on leave,
effective immediately.

10:25.383 --> 10:28.110
Hey, did you hear
Tim got put on admin leave?

10:28.110 --> 10:30.181
- No, who told you that?
- Smitty.

10:34.081 --> 10:35.876
What's that?

10:35.876 --> 10:37.188
Oh, hold on.

10:37.188 --> 10:40.225
Hey.

10:40.225 --> 10:41.641
If you're filing charges
against him,

10:41.641 --> 10:43.573
you need to give me a heads-up.

10:43.573 --> 10:45.783
If I was filing charges,
the last thing I would do

10:45.783 --> 10:48.475
is compromise the case
with any hint of impropriety.

10:48.475 --> 10:51.064
- I'm standing by him 1,000%.
<i>- I know.</i>

10:51.064 --> 10:52.375
Look, I haven't even made it
into the office.

10:52.375 --> 10:54.136
Can we talk later?
- He's family.

10:54.136 --> 10:58.140
<i>I know.
I'll call you later, okay?</i>

10:58.140 --> 11:00.970
- Drama at work?
- Something like that.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.667
Hey. Can I help you?

11:07.667 --> 11:10.255
I'm looking for Sidney.

11:10.255 --> 11:11.187
Yo, what the hell
are you doing?

11:11.187 --> 11:12.395
Can't be ignoring his calls.

11:12.395 --> 11:13.914
Hey, hold on. Back up.

11:13.914 --> 11:15.398
I didn't invite you in.

11:15.398 --> 11:18.022
- I work for her boss.
- I'm her boss.

11:18.022 --> 11:20.783
Nah. You're just in my way.

11:22.405 --> 11:24.442
Now, he wants you back.
Grab your things.

11:24.442 --> 11:26.271
She's not going anywhere.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.378
This is none
of your business, man.

11:29.378 --> 11:31.621
Hmm.

11:31.621 --> 11:33.900
So what's your plan, genius?

11:33.900 --> 11:36.454
You gonna shoot your way in,
kidnap her in broad daylight?

11:36.454 --> 11:38.905
All recorded in HD
from our home security system

11:38.905 --> 11:40.734
that's linked
right into the cloud.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.909
How far do you think
you're gonna make it?

11:42.909 --> 11:46.602
A mile, two, maybe.

11:46.602 --> 11:48.742
Is that worth
a life sentence to you?

11:51.641 --> 11:54.058
Boss ain't gonna like this.

12:02.791 --> 12:04.137
What the hell was that?

12:10.626 --> 12:12.732
- I am so sorry.
- Sorry doesn't come close.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.631
An armed man was at my house.
You need to tell me why.

12:15.631 --> 12:18.807
- I-I can't. I signed an NDA.
- Screw your NDA!

12:18.807 --> 12:21.913
Okay, let me explain to you
how this looks, okay?

12:21.913 --> 12:25.089
Your last employer
was obviously a criminal.

12:25.089 --> 12:29.265
You left him and sought out
a job working for two cops,

12:29.265 --> 12:32.579
a job where you might come
in contact with our computers,

12:32.579 --> 12:34.650
a job where you might
overhear conversations

12:34.650 --> 12:36.445
about the DA's office.

12:36.445 --> 12:39.241
That is not it at all.
I swear.

12:39.241 --> 12:41.933
I didn't even know who he was
when I took the job.

12:41.933 --> 12:43.590
I mean, not--not really.

12:43.590 --> 12:45.316
I-I still don't.

12:45.316 --> 12:48.491
Look, he does something
in finance.

12:48.491 --> 12:49.907
Name?

12:49.907 --> 12:52.116
Christian Batista.

12:52.116 --> 12:54.532
They call the guy
at the door Head Shot.

12:54.532 --> 12:55.913
You thought a guy in finance

12:55.913 --> 12:57.915
had a bodyguard
named Head Shot?

12:57.915 --> 12:59.709
Los Angeles is weird.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.642
I'm from Ohio.

13:01.642 --> 13:04.128
I--

13:04.128 --> 13:06.820
I was naive.
I get that now.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.028
But the kids were sweet,

13:08.028 --> 13:10.824
and I didn't want
to abandon them, so...

13:10.824 --> 13:13.931
I stuck it out, even after
I realized he was a bad guy.

13:13.931 --> 13:16.140
Christian Batista
isn't just a bad guy.

13:16.140 --> 13:18.004
He's a professional
money launderer.

13:18.004 --> 13:20.696
Half the criminal organizations
in the city use his services.

13:20.696 --> 13:22.974
He has been one step ahead
ever since he moved

13:22.974 --> 13:25.390
into the number one position
two years ago.

13:27.392 --> 13:29.360
Would you be willing
to work for him again?

13:29.360 --> 13:31.293
What, like, as a spy?

13:31.293 --> 13:33.122
You wouldn't have to do
anything dangerous,

13:33.122 --> 13:35.745
just pay attention
to who comes and goes,

13:35.745 --> 13:36.885
see what you overhear.

13:36.885 --> 13:39.163
No way.
I-I can't go back there.

13:39.163 --> 13:42.373
He's awful, cruel, and creepy.

13:42.373 --> 13:44.824
I mean, it got to a point where
I was having panic attacks

13:44.824 --> 13:46.239
on my way into work.

13:46.239 --> 13:48.586
I'm--I'm really sorry,
but I-I can't--

13:48.586 --> 13:51.244
I can't do that.

13:51.244 --> 13:54.419
All right, then you are gonna
have to sell him

13:54.419 --> 13:56.007
on a new nanny.

14:11.091 --> 14:12.748
What are you doing?

14:14.439 --> 14:17.684
To be clear, I'm still mad
at you, okay?

14:17.684 --> 14:19.341
This doesn't change anything.

14:19.341 --> 14:20.652
What doesn't?

14:26.693 --> 14:28.626
Are you okay?

14:28.626 --> 14:30.455
I am now.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.126
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:46.126 --> 14:48.266
- We need you for a case.
- Of course.

14:53.064 --> 14:55.066
Just say the word, and I'll
have you on a private plane

14:55.066 --> 14:56.896
to a non-extradition country.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.035
It's not gonna come to that.

14:58.035 --> 14:59.450
There is zero evidence
of wrongdoing

14:59.450 --> 15:00.727
because there wasn't any.

15:00.727 --> 15:03.557
- If I can do anything--
- I appreciate that.

15:03.557 --> 15:05.283
You had my back
on the last thing.

15:05.283 --> 15:07.492
I put different forces
into play.

15:07.492 --> 15:10.737
Different's not me.

15:10.737 --> 15:12.290
I'll see you later.

15:19.608 --> 15:21.921
Bradford was
clearly being cagey.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.646
Your questioning
was aggressive.

15:23.646 --> 15:24.924
Tim was being measured.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.029
Of course you would say that.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.793
Well, he certainly
has it in for Tim.

15:32.793 --> 15:35.693
We ask everyone else
to trust our process.

15:35.693 --> 15:37.177
We should too.

15:37.177 --> 15:38.696
Sir, before you came in,

15:38.696 --> 15:41.941
Tim asked me to look
into something delicate.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.356
He thinks--

15:43.356 --> 15:44.771
- I know what he thinks.
- Are you sure?

15:44.771 --> 15:46.980
Because what he said was--
- Insane?

15:46.980 --> 15:50.156
And, if true,
a disaster of epic proportions?

15:50.156 --> 15:51.951
I'm sure.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.159
With your permission,

15:53.159 --> 15:54.539
I'd like
to sit out patrol today,

15:54.539 --> 15:55.609
conduct an investigation.

15:55.609 --> 15:57.163
No.

15:57.163 --> 15:58.992
You and Officer Juarez

15:58.992 --> 16:01.546
would like a professional
development day.

16:01.546 --> 16:04.377
And I'm granting that request.

16:04.377 --> 16:07.449
But don't come back until
you have something concrete.

16:07.449 --> 16:09.382
We don't know who we can trust.

16:09.382 --> 16:12.040
And if I'm questioned,
I'll be compelled to answer.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.800
So the less I know, the better.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.320
Understood.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.288
Remember,
you're responsible for her.

16:19.288 --> 16:21.704
Don't compromise her career
before it starts.

16:21.704 --> 16:23.085
Yes, sir.

16:24.914 --> 16:27.469
Juarez.

16:27.469 --> 16:29.816
That's crazy.
How could they suspect Tim?

16:29.816 --> 16:32.163
Let's talk in private.

16:32.163 --> 16:33.544
What's
professional development?

16:33.544 --> 16:35.028
It's just BS.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.065
I need to look into something
on the down-low.

16:37.065 --> 16:38.549
You don't have to help me.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.413
This is gonna be
a sticky situation,

16:40.413 --> 16:42.553
and I will understand if you
want to sit this one out.

16:42.553 --> 16:44.555
And you can't tell me
what it is before I decide?

16:44.555 --> 16:46.350
I cannot.

16:46.350 --> 16:49.422
This is so cool.
Okay, I'm in. What's going on?

16:49.422 --> 16:51.700
Tim believes Dr. London
blackmailed Mad Dog.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.702
That's why he betrayed
the Metro op.

16:53.702 --> 16:55.255
Aaron's shrink?
No, that can't be.

16:55.255 --> 16:56.705
Aaron raves about her.

16:56.705 --> 16:58.431
Oh, I know.
But Tim is convinced.

16:58.431 --> 17:00.571
And if she's blackmailed
one cop, there may be more.

17:00.571 --> 17:03.332
- You don't think Aaron...
- I don't know.

17:03.332 --> 17:05.093
I don't think
he would betray us,

17:05.093 --> 17:06.749
but we can't rule it out
either.

17:06.749 --> 17:10.098
Anyone she sees
could be a problem.

17:10.098 --> 17:12.445
Okay, so we need a list
of her patients.

17:12.445 --> 17:14.102
No. Confidential.

17:14.102 --> 17:16.621
It's impossible to get a judge
to sign off on that

17:16.621 --> 17:20.453
without clear evidence
of a criminal conspiracy.

17:20.453 --> 17:23.525
Wait, Smitty's gonna solve
our problem.

17:23.525 --> 17:25.044
I'm sorry,
it sounds like you said

17:25.044 --> 17:26.631
Smitty was gonna help solve
our problem.

17:26.631 --> 17:27.908
Mm-hmm.

17:27.908 --> 17:29.703
What's up, homeys?

17:29.703 --> 17:31.636
Aaron says you hang out
in the waiting room

17:31.636 --> 17:33.604
of the Department of Psychiatry
office.

17:33.604 --> 17:35.882
Hey, where I spend my breaks
is my business.

17:35.882 --> 17:38.402
No, agreed,
but you do see who comes in

17:38.402 --> 17:40.093
for therapy sessions.
- Sure.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.613
- How often are you there?
- Ah, let's see.

17:42.613 --> 17:46.720
Vending machines get restocked
on Mondays and Thursdays.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.724
Uh, Dr. Mendelson brings in
cupcakes on Tuesdays.

17:50.724 --> 17:53.244
Red velvet, yum.

17:53.244 --> 17:56.834
Uh, shrinks cater
an interoffice meeting

17:56.834 --> 17:59.595
on Wednesday,
and there's always leftovers.

17:59.595 --> 18:00.631
You're there
from Monday through Thursday?

18:00.631 --> 18:02.253
And Friday.

18:02.253 --> 18:04.980
The Personnel office
next door holds a mixer

18:04.980 --> 18:06.844
with passed hors d'oeuvres.

18:06.844 --> 18:08.742
Smitty, that's every single--
never mind.

18:08.742 --> 18:11.469
Don't--I just...

18:11.469 --> 18:13.747
how would you like to take
an extra-long break today?

18:13.747 --> 18:16.992
All you have to do is tell us
everyone who sees Dr. London.

18:16.992 --> 18:18.442
Sure thing.

18:18.442 --> 18:21.928
But I gotta tell you right now,
it's a long list.

18:21.928 --> 18:24.137
It's cops
from all over the city.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.243
We'll need every name
you can remember,

18:26.243 --> 18:28.521
plus anyone who sees her today.

18:28.521 --> 18:30.488
That sounds like a lot of work.

18:30.488 --> 18:32.007
What is this, anyway?

18:32.007 --> 18:33.181
All you need to know is,

18:33.181 --> 18:35.114
it'll help Tim,
and he's counting on you.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.012
He told us Smitty is the man,

18:37.012 --> 18:38.634
and he's the only one
we can trust with this.

18:38.634 --> 18:40.015
Say no more.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.332
What?

18:46.332 --> 18:47.712
Dr. London's been talking

18:47.712 --> 18:49.783
to cops from all over the city
for six months.

18:49.783 --> 18:52.338
There's no telling how many
cases she's compromised.

18:52.338 --> 18:54.685
Yeah, but someone
would have noticed by now.

18:57.619 --> 18:59.483
Ah, here she is.
Hey, you.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.519
Oh, hi.

19:01.519 --> 19:03.383
Any idea how old
this yogurt is?

19:03.383 --> 19:05.799
Oh, I'm guessing
Reagan administration.

19:05.799 --> 19:07.353
We need your help.

19:07.353 --> 19:09.044
Ooh, do I get
to kick in a door?

19:09.044 --> 19:10.804
Is it hard?
It's hard, right?

19:10.804 --> 19:12.806
It's not easy, but that's
not where this is going.

19:12.806 --> 19:14.532
Look, as a dispatcher,

19:14.532 --> 19:17.052
you are at the nexus
of all police activity.

19:17.052 --> 19:19.296
Have you noticed any uptick

19:19.296 --> 19:21.505
in failed
police actions lately?

19:21.505 --> 19:25.716
Anything like, um, attempts
to locate that came up null?

19:25.716 --> 19:27.649
Like someone warned a target.

19:27.649 --> 19:29.513
Right, or a warrant where
the disposition was N-Nora?

19:29.513 --> 19:31.100
Yes.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.757
I thought I was imagining it,

19:32.757 --> 19:34.656
but the fail rate is up
all over the city.

19:34.656 --> 19:36.658
- How much?
- It's subtle.

19:36.658 --> 19:38.832
Most people wouldn't notice it,
but I did.

19:38.832 --> 19:40.040
Of course you did.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.904
Could you pull a list for me

19:41.904 --> 19:43.389
of everything
that's gone sideways

19:43.389 --> 19:44.735
in the last six months

19:44.735 --> 19:46.771
and the officers
who were attached

19:46.771 --> 19:48.221
to those failed actions?

19:48.221 --> 19:51.259
Absolutely.
I'll get right on it.

19:51.259 --> 19:54.607
Oh, is there any chance I could
record all this for my podcast?

19:54.607 --> 19:57.575
Oh, um...

19:57.575 --> 19:58.852
- Get back to me.
- Okay.

19:58.852 --> 20:00.233
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.062
- She has a podcast?
- It's good.

20:02.062 --> 20:04.272
Hmm.

20:04.272 --> 20:07.275
- Lopez, you have a minute?
- Barely.

20:07.275 --> 20:09.277
Look, I know you're close
with Bradford,

20:09.277 --> 20:11.244
and I just wanted to say
none of this is personal.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.418
It's just a job.

20:12.418 --> 20:14.040
Is that it?
I gotta get in there.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.353
Something break
on your John Doe murder?

20:16.353 --> 20:18.355
No, we're juggling
a lot today.

20:18.355 --> 20:19.528
Have you ever worked
on anything

20:19.528 --> 20:21.047
connected to Christian Batista?

20:21.047 --> 20:23.256
The money launderer?
No. You got a way in?

20:23.256 --> 20:25.224
Too soon to tell.
Thanks.

20:29.089 --> 20:31.057
All right,
how are you with kids?

20:31.057 --> 20:33.266
- I nannied for two years.
- Perfect.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.062
Uh, Batista needs child care,
and his former nanny...

20:36.062 --> 20:37.236
Our current nanny.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.065
Is willing
to sing your praises.

20:39.065 --> 20:40.894
Wow.
Okay, that's a lot.

20:40.894 --> 20:43.069
Um, I still need to land
the job, though, right?

20:43.069 --> 20:45.071
We can create
fake references.

20:45.071 --> 20:47.073
You should start setting up
social media now,

20:47.073 --> 20:48.454
establish a life.
- No need.

20:48.454 --> 20:50.456
I've actually got
eight undercover identities

20:50.456 --> 20:51.836
that I regularly feed.

20:51.836 --> 20:54.287
It takes, like,
12 off-duty hours to grow,

20:54.287 --> 20:56.807
but, you know, I thought I was
gonna make detective, so...

20:56.807 --> 20:58.602
Any of them have
nanny experience?

20:58.602 --> 21:01.294
Uh, no, but there's one
that might work, actually.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.400
She has no criminal history,
college graduate,

21:03.400 --> 21:05.125
a little lost in life,

21:05.125 --> 21:07.507
but on paper,
she'll look good to them.

21:07.507 --> 21:09.578
- Hey, am I interrupting?
- A little. What do you need?

21:09.578 --> 21:11.580
Well, we processed
the last of the license plates

21:11.580 --> 21:12.926
for cars parked
in the four-block radius

21:12.926 --> 21:14.790
around Monica's house.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.345
All are registered to neighbors
or employees of neighbors.

21:17.345 --> 21:19.347
So we can assume Monica's
attacker didn't drive there.

21:19.347 --> 21:21.280
Mm-hmm,
and Ubering to a crime scene

21:21.280 --> 21:22.591
seems not smart.

21:22.591 --> 21:24.179
So you're thinking
there was a partner?

21:24.179 --> 21:26.112
Yeah, and he took off
when he heard sirens coming.

21:26.112 --> 21:28.356
Great.

21:28.356 --> 21:30.875
What is Monica doing here?

21:30.875 --> 21:33.844
Keep prepping.
We'll circle back.

21:33.844 --> 21:36.018
Jumpy. I've got it.

21:36.018 --> 21:38.331
Angela, how's baby Jack?

21:38.331 --> 21:40.368
Not a baby anymore.
What are you doing here?

21:40.368 --> 21:41.852
I'm sorry.
How do you two know each other?

21:41.852 --> 21:44.510
Oh, I worked for Angela
and Wesley about a year ago.

21:44.510 --> 21:45.994
Oh.

21:45.994 --> 21:48.237
That'll teach me to do
a deeper dive on references.

21:48.237 --> 21:50.170
You're working
for Monica now?

21:50.170 --> 21:52.518
- Just started.
- You know, call me crazy,

21:52.518 --> 21:54.382
but hiring private security
indicates a worry

21:54.382 --> 21:55.900
about impending danger.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.488
Which would imply
that Monica thinks

21:57.488 --> 21:59.248
she was attacked deliberately
rather than the victim

21:59.248 --> 22:00.871
of a random burglary.

22:00.871 --> 22:03.977
There you go again, trying
to make my trauma my fault.

22:03.977 --> 22:05.669
But I'm the victim here.

22:05.669 --> 22:08.188
And as such,
I'm entitled to know

22:08.188 --> 22:09.983
about the investigation
into my attack.

22:09.983 --> 22:11.468
Per the crime victims'
bill of rights,

22:11.468 --> 22:13.366
you have to share
the details of my case.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.404
So share.

22:21.305 --> 22:22.582
Okay, on paper,
Blair is totally clean--

22:22.582 --> 22:24.377
modest apartment, modest car.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.654
If she's doing this
for the money,

22:25.654 --> 22:26.862
it's hard to see
where it's going.

22:26.862 --> 22:28.416
Any criminal history?

22:28.416 --> 22:30.728
Ah, just a grad school DUI

22:30.728 --> 22:33.386
and no family
with ties to Barrio Rosa.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.698
If we want to get more insight,

22:34.698 --> 22:37.114
we need to talk
to people who know her.

22:37.114 --> 22:39.219
Yeah, but we don't want
to risk tipping her off.

22:39.219 --> 22:41.221
You know, there is
one known associate

22:41.221 --> 22:44.121
we haven't investigated yet--
Mad Dog.

22:44.121 --> 22:46.226
A séance.
I like it.

22:46.226 --> 22:48.401
Or we could just search
his apartment.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.955
Right, yeah, yeah,
probably easier.

22:50.955 --> 22:52.267
But one of these days,

22:52.267 --> 22:54.511
you're gonna say yes
to a séance.

22:54.511 --> 22:55.753
<i>I got a problem.</i>

22:55.753 --> 22:57.721
Monica's here,
and she wants to exercise

22:57.721 --> 22:59.239
her rights as a victim.

22:59.239 --> 23:00.965
What exactly are we required
to tell her?

23:00.965 --> 23:02.519
<i>I can't answer that.</i>

23:02.519 --> 23:04.037
Just by you calling me
about this,

23:04.037 --> 23:05.418
Monica could assert collusion.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.316
I am hanging up,
but I love you.

23:07.316 --> 23:08.387
Bye.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.044
We're on our own.

23:11.044 --> 23:13.115
Hmm, what else is new?

23:15.946 --> 23:17.775
Have you identified
my attacker?

23:17.775 --> 23:19.225
- No.
- Why not?

23:19.225 --> 23:20.468
He's not in the system.

23:20.468 --> 23:21.986
Do you have any idea
why he targeted me?

23:21.986 --> 23:23.332
We do not.

23:23.332 --> 23:24.886
Was he working alone?

23:24.886 --> 23:27.302
We don't believe so.

23:27.302 --> 23:28.614
Why?

23:28.614 --> 23:30.236
We're not at liberty
to say at this point.

23:30.236 --> 23:31.755
We have to protect
sources and means.

23:31.755 --> 23:33.722
I'll file a complaint
with the department.

23:33.722 --> 23:35.483
Go ahead--I'm sure they will
get to it by next year.

23:35.483 --> 23:37.070
Am I under investigation?

23:37.070 --> 23:39.418
That information
is not within the bounds

23:39.418 --> 23:41.350
of the Victims' Rights Act.

23:41.350 --> 23:43.801
- That is a yes.
- That's none of your business.

23:43.801 --> 23:45.251
Sorry, when can I
expect payment

23:45.251 --> 23:46.839
from the state victims' fund?

23:46.839 --> 23:48.634
We'll get started on that
paperwork as soon as possible.

23:48.634 --> 23:50.463
Great.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.569
I expect to be apprised
of all future developments.

23:52.569 --> 23:54.294
Of course.

23:57.539 --> 24:00.956
We need to find John Doe's
accomplice before she does.

24:00.956 --> 24:02.751
<i>It's a toxic household.</i>

24:02.751 --> 24:05.374
They went through eight nannies

24:05.374 --> 24:07.515
in the 12 months
before they hired me.

24:07.515 --> 24:09.206
I would have stayed
with my last family forever,

24:09.206 --> 24:11.450
but the kids grew up.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.452
So here I am.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.385
I mean, Mr. Batista
is casually cruel,

24:16.385 --> 24:19.803
and Mrs. Batista drinks
a lot to manage it.

24:19.803 --> 24:22.150
<i>But, I mean,
she does love the kids.</i>

24:22.150 --> 24:24.635
I understand how stressful
parenthood can be,

24:24.635 --> 24:27.155
and I see my role
as helping to alleviate that

24:27.155 --> 24:28.639
as much as possible.

24:28.639 --> 24:30.779
I have a perfect
driving record.

24:30.779 --> 24:31.815
I'm great with homework.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.299
I speak Cantonese,

24:33.299 --> 24:34.714
as well as a little bit
of Spanish.

24:34.714 --> 24:38.166
And while I understand
that discipline is important,

24:38.166 --> 24:40.824
a certain amount of play
is healthy

24:40.824 --> 24:42.688
for childhood development.

24:42.688 --> 24:45.553
Joshua, Esther,
come over here.

24:48.176 --> 24:49.522
What have I told you
about spying?

24:49.522 --> 24:50.730
What do you say?

24:50.730 --> 24:52.145
both: Sorry.

24:52.145 --> 24:54.389
Bums are sorry.

24:54.389 --> 24:57.875
A man apologizes
when he makes a mistake.

24:57.875 --> 25:00.153
Yes, sir.
We apologize for spying.

25:00.153 --> 25:02.397
I'm sorry.

25:02.397 --> 25:05.296
Go start your homework.
both: Yes, Father.

25:08.092 --> 25:11.268
Okay, you seem fine,
and we need someone now,

25:11.268 --> 25:13.581
but you are on a short leash.

25:13.581 --> 25:15.168
See the house manager
on your way out.

25:15.168 --> 25:16.860
Yes, sir. I'm looking forward
to getting started.

25:16.860 --> 25:18.896
Thank you.

25:26.455 --> 25:28.457
Well, we got
Pearson's property receipt.

25:28.457 --> 25:29.873
What did he take?

25:29.873 --> 25:33.221
Just a few firearms,
laptop, and not much else.

25:33.221 --> 25:35.464
What exactly are we
looking for?

25:35.464 --> 25:38.606
"Dear diary, today Blair
started blackmailing me"?

25:38.606 --> 25:40.608
We should be so lucky.

25:40.608 --> 25:42.679
All right,
let's tear this place apart.

25:57.763 --> 25:59.937
- Stay with the car.
- I can't do that.

25:59.937 --> 26:01.490
Well, you can't come in.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.320
I need to have
a privileged conversation.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.321
Then I'll walk you
to the door.

26:04.321 --> 26:06.495
It's nonnegotiable.

26:06.495 --> 26:07.980
Fine.

26:10.914 --> 26:12.122
Gundo is expecting me.

26:13.779 --> 26:15.643
I'm the lawyer.

26:15.643 --> 26:16.920
Yeah.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.162
- All right.

26:36.284 --> 26:38.493
Thank you for seeing me.

26:38.493 --> 26:41.289
Oh.

26:41.289 --> 26:43.671
You kept my nephew
out of prison.

26:43.671 --> 26:45.465
It's the least I could do.

26:45.465 --> 26:47.916
What do you think?

26:47.916 --> 26:49.538
You want the truth?

26:51.817 --> 26:55.544
The truth is that, uh...

26:55.544 --> 26:57.754
it's good
for my blood pressure.

26:57.754 --> 26:59.790
I'll make this quick.

26:59.790 --> 27:02.034
A hit man came after me.

27:02.034 --> 27:04.139
Cops can't ID him,
and neither can I,

27:04.139 --> 27:06.348
which means he must be
from out of town.

27:06.348 --> 27:08.868
I need to know who sent him.

27:08.868 --> 27:12.147
Risky move coming here.

27:12.147 --> 27:16.496
You got a price on your head,
maybe I should collect.

27:16.496 --> 27:19.879
I promise I'm worth
more to you alive.

27:19.879 --> 27:23.365
I heard a lot
of talk about you.

27:23.365 --> 27:27.335
You got some secret pipeline
into the LAPD,

27:27.335 --> 27:30.649
selling information
to the highest bidder.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.374
Wow.

27:32.374 --> 27:35.170
You're acting
like you own this city.

27:35.170 --> 27:36.827
Oh, no, no, no.

27:36.827 --> 27:38.864
I have no illusions

27:38.864 --> 27:42.591
about who really runs
these streets.

27:42.591 --> 27:44.801
I'm simply
an information broker.

27:44.801 --> 27:46.526
Nothing more.

27:46.526 --> 27:49.322
I just need a name.

27:49.322 --> 27:51.877
And I'm willing to pay you
to track it down.

27:51.877 --> 27:54.017
Hmm.

27:54.017 --> 27:55.397
Let's go.

27:59.229 --> 28:02.301
- Everything okay?
- Not yet.

28:06.857 --> 28:08.203
Ah, we struck out.

28:08.203 --> 28:10.723
Pearson didn't take much
because there wasn't much.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.725
Ooh, what's that?

28:12.725 --> 28:16.004
Extensive notes on his...

28:16.004 --> 28:17.523
fantasy football draft.

28:17.523 --> 28:21.216
Okay, so the search
is officially a bust.

28:21.216 --> 28:22.493
Maybe not.

28:27.671 --> 28:29.466
Here to relieve me?
Thank God.

28:29.466 --> 28:30.950
I'm way over-caffeinated.

28:30.950 --> 28:32.572
No, I'm here
to see Dr. Blair.

28:32.572 --> 28:34.471
Is she in with a patient?
- Yeah, with Cooper from Vice.

28:34.471 --> 28:36.059
Session should be over
in a few.

28:36.059 --> 28:37.888
It's over now.

28:37.888 --> 28:40.442
- Um, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.

28:40.442 --> 28:41.892
Don, hey, I'm so sorry.

28:41.892 --> 28:43.929
I need to talk to the doc.
I'm in crisis.

28:43.929 --> 28:45.206
Thanks so much
for understanding.

28:45.206 --> 28:46.759
Say hi to Helen for me.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.623
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

28:48.623 --> 28:50.936
Mad Dog didn't give the ops
plans to Barrio Rosa directly.

28:50.936 --> 28:53.421
There was an intermediary--you.

28:53.421 --> 28:54.871
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:54.871 --> 28:58.426
Nash will never walk again.
Mad Dog is dead.

28:58.426 --> 28:59.599
I don't think you wanted

28:59.599 --> 29:01.394
for either of those things
to happen.

29:01.394 --> 29:03.327
I think you want to do
the right thing,

29:03.327 --> 29:04.743
but you're scared.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.883
Make a deal with us.
We can protect you.

29:06.883 --> 29:09.092
I don't know
where you're getting this.

29:09.092 --> 29:11.577
Found this
in Mad Dog's apartment.

29:11.577 --> 29:14.338
It lays out everything.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.755
Whatever is in that notebook
is a lie.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.584
Matt was a deeply troubled man,

29:18.584 --> 29:20.931
and I only wish I knew
how deeply before his death.

29:20.931 --> 29:22.139
Now, I have
another patient coming.

29:22.139 --> 29:23.589
You need to leave.

29:23.589 --> 29:25.694
I don't think you're running
this alone, Blair.

29:25.694 --> 29:27.800
You only started this job
six months ago.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.527
There's no way you hatched
a plan to criminalize cops

29:30.527 --> 29:33.116
and then developed contacts
with gangs and cartels

29:33.116 --> 29:34.945
all on your own,

29:34.945 --> 29:37.258
which means
you're a potential weak link.

29:37.258 --> 29:40.433
Weak links get fixed
permanently.

29:40.433 --> 29:43.195
I'm not the one
you need to be afraid of.

29:43.195 --> 29:46.508
I'm your best shot
at getting out of this alive.

29:52.687 --> 29:55.379
- How did she take it?
- We're about to find out.

29:55.379 --> 29:57.934
Hey, TSA came through
with a fingerprint match

29:57.934 --> 29:59.521
and ID'd the John Doe
who attacked Monica--

29:59.521 --> 30:01.109
Samuel Desta.

30:01.109 --> 30:02.973
He came in
on a Portuguese passport

30:02.973 --> 30:04.941
traveling
with one Andrei Gwarzo.

30:04.941 --> 30:06.356
I pulled footage of them
in their rental car

30:06.356 --> 30:08.841
driving away from the airport.
- New car.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.532
Probably has satellite radio
we can track.

30:10.532 --> 30:12.534
Technically,
we owe Monica a call

30:12.534 --> 30:14.882
now that we have found
her attacker and his partner.

30:14.882 --> 30:16.124
Technically,
that call should come

30:16.124 --> 30:17.850
from the community liaison.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.301
Who has gone home already.

30:20.301 --> 30:23.028
Is it weird that I'm nervous
walking through the bullpen,

30:23.028 --> 30:24.305
waiting to see which cop reacts

30:24.305 --> 30:26.134
to your conversation
with Blair?

30:26.134 --> 30:28.171
No, I'm a little on edge too.

30:28.171 --> 30:30.173
Okay,
what if nothing happens?

30:30.173 --> 30:32.209
What the hell were you doing
in Mad Dog's apartment?

30:32.209 --> 30:34.315
That's my scene.

30:34.315 --> 30:36.213
It's my case.
- I had a warrant.

30:36.213 --> 30:38.560
If you so much as removed
a speck of dust,

30:38.560 --> 30:39.976
you're going down
for obstruction.

30:39.976 --> 30:42.047
Hey, hey, hey.
Why are you yelling at my guys?

30:42.047 --> 30:45.567
- They interfered with my case!
- Then you come talk to me!

30:45.567 --> 30:48.847
If anyone needs discipline,
I'll handle it.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.607
Stay in your lane.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.682
Thank you for that.

30:56.682 --> 30:58.891
- Do I want to know?
- Not yet.

31:01.790 --> 31:05.242
Okay, so you rattled Blair,
and she called Pearson.

31:05.242 --> 31:07.624
And he's in charge
of Mad Dog's case,

31:07.624 --> 31:09.626
which explains why
he's gunning so hard for Tim.

31:09.626 --> 31:11.386
Okay, so what's
our next move?

31:11.386 --> 31:13.388
We need to see
how deep this rot goes.

31:13.388 --> 31:14.562
Did Smitty give you
Blair's patient list?

31:14.562 --> 31:16.012
Yeah.

31:16.012 --> 31:17.220
Let's put the fear of God
into them.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.394
Oh, hey, Mike, really quick--

31:19.394 --> 31:21.396
as your union rep, I just
wanted to give you a heads-up

31:21.396 --> 31:22.881
about the department
psychiatrist.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.020
I'm just hearing
that Dr. London's

31:24.020 --> 31:25.400
getting investigated.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.092
I wouldn't want you
to get pulled into that.

31:27.092 --> 31:29.197
I got a great therapist
if you need to make a change.

31:29.197 --> 31:31.027
I'm not worried
at this point.

31:31.027 --> 31:33.408
It's probably nothing
more than a witch hunt.

31:33.408 --> 31:35.963
But as your union rep,
I just wanted you to know

31:35.963 --> 31:37.930
I'm looking out for you.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.414
Oh, and vote for Nolan 2025.

31:43.073 --> 31:44.903
- You think it worked?

31:44.903 --> 31:47.077
I think Blair's getting
a lot of frantic phone calls.

31:47.077 --> 31:49.390
Hopefully it'll rattle her
enough to reach out.

31:54.636 --> 31:56.707
Impeccable, as always.

32:00.090 --> 32:03.093
You did something different.
New lipstick?

32:03.093 --> 32:04.957
New enemy.

32:06.994 --> 32:10.618
Someone is trying to kill me,
and I need to know who.

32:10.618 --> 32:12.482
And you're
in a unique position,

32:12.482 --> 32:13.862
being surrounded by members

32:13.862 --> 32:16.244
of every criminal organization
in California.

32:16.244 --> 32:19.661
Well, if you're here
for the hot prison goss,

32:19.661 --> 32:21.008
it's gonna cost you.

32:21.008 --> 32:23.458
What do you know?
I'm feeling generous.

32:23.458 --> 32:24.632
I like the sound of that.

32:24.632 --> 32:26.082
Give me the 411.

32:26.082 --> 32:27.980
Two men came after me.

32:27.980 --> 32:31.121
One attacked me in my home.
The other is in the wind.

32:31.121 --> 32:33.468
What happened
to the guy who attacked you?

32:33.468 --> 32:36.506
Dead,
under mysterious circumstances.

32:36.506 --> 32:38.887
Nice.

32:38.887 --> 32:40.786
What else can you tell me?

32:40.786 --> 32:43.962
They were professionals,
not local.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.377
Follow the money.

32:45.377 --> 32:47.689
I don't have access
to their accounts.

32:47.689 --> 32:50.623
Yes, but you know whoever
hired them was a criminal

32:50.623 --> 32:52.108
who had dirty money
that he needed clean

32:52.108 --> 32:53.661
to make the payment.

32:53.661 --> 32:57.458
One man controls 80% of
the laundering in this city--

32:57.458 --> 32:59.356
Christian Batista.

32:59.356 --> 33:01.048
Okay, these answers
are correct,

33:01.048 --> 33:03.912
but is this
your best handwriting?

33:03.912 --> 33:05.535
No eraser.

33:05.535 --> 33:08.124
You're not getting out
of redoing it that easily.

33:08.124 --> 33:09.539
I'll go get you another one.
Stay here, okay?

33:15.821 --> 33:18.099
Coming!

33:21.861 --> 33:23.587
Can I help you?

33:23.587 --> 33:25.555
I'm here to see
Christian Batista.

33:25.555 --> 33:26.728
I have an appointment.

33:42.261 --> 33:44.022
Satellite radio
still got you on hold?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.678
She told me to call back when
I had the court order number.

33:45.678 --> 33:47.059
I told her it took 15 minutes
just to get a live person--

33:47.059 --> 33:48.681
Yes, I'm still here.

33:48.681 --> 33:50.407
My partner is on the phone
right now with the court clerk.

33:50.407 --> 33:51.788
No, it's not in my email.

33:51.788 --> 33:53.445
We'll have the number
literally in two seconds.

33:53.445 --> 33:54.549
He's still reading it?

33:54.549 --> 33:55.792
Can you tell him that this is

33:55.792 --> 33:57.414
an in-progress
life-threatening event?

33:57.414 --> 33:59.968
- Maybe five.
- Yes, exigent circumstance--

33:59.968 --> 34:01.349
yes, I will hold.

34:01.349 --> 34:02.902
These are
exigent circumstances.

34:02.902 --> 34:04.456
Can't you override it?

34:04.456 --> 34:07.528
No, don't call corporate
and get back to me.

34:07.528 --> 34:09.737
It's coming right now--
literally five more seconds.

34:09.737 --> 34:13.396
Yes, Judge Walter Gonzalez,
today's date, uh, uh,

34:13.396 --> 34:18.090
court authorization number
122-4-69.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.712
Okay, got it--
Judge Walter Gonzalez,

34:19.712 --> 34:22.784
today's date, court
authorization number 122-4-69.

34:22.784 --> 34:24.717
GPS tracking
via satellite radio

34:24.717 --> 34:26.788
for suspect vehicle,
rental car stock...

34:26.788 --> 34:28.790
Number LA-592B-boy.

34:28.790 --> 34:30.137
both:
Thank you.

34:30.137 --> 34:32.898
Whew, yes.

34:32.898 --> 34:35.107
I'll pull up the location
for Gwarzo's vehicle.

34:35.107 --> 34:36.626
And I'll call dispatch
and have them make

34:36.626 --> 34:39.663
an attempt to locate event,
10-36, not for broadcast.

34:39.663 --> 34:42.597
<i>You're building quite
a reputation for yourself.</i>

34:42.597 --> 34:44.979
I hear you're selling
police reports and information

34:44.979 --> 34:47.119
to half the criminal
organizations in town.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.465
Smart.

34:48.465 --> 34:50.640
Intel is the currency
of the future.

34:50.640 --> 34:53.746
I also hear you had
a recent near-death experience.

34:53.746 --> 34:55.748
My guess is, you're here to see
if I can tell you

34:55.748 --> 34:57.440
who sent them.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.131
Your guess is correct.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.753
I don't know
what to tell you.

35:00.753 --> 35:02.617
It wasn't me.

35:02.617 --> 35:05.793
You're a money launderer.
Everyone uses your services.

35:05.793 --> 35:10.108
The only person with better
connections in this town is me.

35:11.730 --> 35:14.491
Ask around.
I'll make it worth your while.

35:14.491 --> 35:16.700
I'll see what I can do.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.944
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

35:18.944 --> 35:20.980
Likewise.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.637
Vera will see you out.

35:24.915 --> 35:27.642

7769 Windsor Court, room 216.
King's Court Motel.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.058
You better hurry.
They're on the move now.

36:04.058 --> 36:06.543
You have 15 minutes tops.

36:06.543 --> 36:09.028
Hey.
Thanks for helping out.

36:09.028 --> 36:10.582
Of course.
What do you need?

36:10.582 --> 36:13.585
We're looking for this guy,
Andrei Gwarzo.

36:13.585 --> 36:16.001
Recent photo.
Unknown criminal history.

36:16.001 --> 36:18.417
- Is he armed?
- Yeah, almost certainly.

36:20.764 --> 36:22.352
You need to leave!

36:24.251 --> 36:26.218
Hey, you need
to get out of here now!

36:28.772 --> 36:30.049
Detain that punk.

36:42.579 --> 36:45.375
Go after the shooter!
We got the room!

37:04.083 --> 37:06.051
Police!
Open up!

37:13.058 --> 37:14.439
Clear.

37:16.441 --> 37:17.994
Control, 2331.

37:17.994 --> 37:20.410
Andrei Gwarzo is GOA.

37:31.145 --> 37:32.974
My guys held up their end.

37:32.974 --> 37:34.735
Yeah, I never go back
on my word.

37:34.735 --> 37:36.633
Free representation
starts today

37:36.633 --> 37:40.154
with those two kids
that got arrested.

37:40.154 --> 37:42.260
What do you have
in mind for him?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.054
He's gonna tell me
who sent him.

37:45.953 --> 37:49.577
You are swimming
in deep water.

37:49.577 --> 37:52.166
No one keeps
their hands clean here.

37:52.166 --> 37:55.134
You want the name, you get it.

37:57.136 --> 37:59.173
Not a problem.

37:59.173 --> 38:02.694
But I'm gonna need something
a lot sharper in a few minutes.

38:09.494 --> 38:11.012
Hi.

38:11.012 --> 38:13.429
Gosh, this must be awkward
for you.

38:13.429 --> 38:15.154
I'm the target,
and yet you're the one

38:15.154 --> 38:16.777
that's about to be dismembered.

38:16.777 --> 38:17.812
- Wait.
- No.

38:17.812 --> 38:19.193
It's not
question-and-answer time.

38:19.193 --> 38:21.471
Not yet.

38:21.471 --> 38:23.439
I need you to know
that I mean business

38:23.439 --> 38:24.957
when I'm talking to you,

38:24.957 --> 38:27.201
and I need to be sure
that you're telling the truth.

38:29.203 --> 38:31.654
Take off his shoes.
- No, no!

38:31.654 --> 38:33.000
No!

38:36.106 --> 38:37.349
It was Monica. Has to be.

38:37.349 --> 38:40.248
She got to him before we did.
- Yeah, but how?

38:40.248 --> 38:42.975
- Hey, how was your day?
- Long.

38:42.975 --> 38:45.461
- Kids are a lot.
- No, the kids were a breeze.

38:45.461 --> 38:47.808
Monica stopping by the house
was what the issue was.

38:47.808 --> 38:49.672
What?
Is Batista a client?

38:49.672 --> 38:51.363
It seems like they just met.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.227
Sounds like she's got
someone after her,

38:53.227 --> 38:54.815
and she wants him
to ask around.

38:54.815 --> 38:56.472
That's why she didn't have
Andrei killed on the spot.

38:56.472 --> 38:58.370
She needed to torture
the name out of him.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.234
