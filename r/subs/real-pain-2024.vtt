01:19.666 --> 01:21.957
Hey, Benji. It's me.
I'm just leaving my apartment.

01:21.958 --> 01:24.332
Remember, we gotta be there,
like, three hours early.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.915
Yeah, just, um, ring me when you get this.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.624
Hey, Benji. I hope you left already

01:30.625 --> 01:32.582
'cause I'm stuck in
a little traffic on the BQE.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.457
Just in case you can avoid it.

01:34.458 --> 01:36.708
Uh, anyway, just ring me
when you get this.

01:38.416 --> 01:40.582
Hey, Benji. Actually,
traffic just cleared up.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.749
So that's pretty good,
if you were worried.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.207
Maybe you weren't. Anyway, just ring me

01:44.208 --> 01:45.790
when you get this, anyway.

01:45.791 --> 01:48.374
Hey, Benji. I'm sorry I'm
leaving so many messages.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.290
Just... Sorry. You can
disregard them 'cause I'm...

01:50.291 --> 01:51.832
I'll be there soon, and I, uh...

01:51.833 --> 01:52.915
Yeah. I can't wait to see you,

01:52.916 --> 01:54.958
and I will not leave you
another message. Okay. Bye.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.957
Hey, Benji. Uh, I just got to the airport.

01:58.958 --> 02:00.915
I really hope you left already
or that you're, like,

02:00.916 --> 02:02.207
I don't know, on your way.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.541
Anyway, just, uh, ring me
when you get this.

02:09.083 --> 02:10.332
Whoa!

02:10.333 --> 02:12.208
- Oh, God. You made it.
- What's up, cuz?

02:12.541 --> 02:14.624
Oh, man, come here.
I called you so many times.

02:14.625 --> 02:15.707
Step back, dude.
Let me have a look at you.

02:15.708 --> 02:16.791
It's so good to see... Yeah.

02:17.333 --> 02:18.665
- Okay.
- Turn around. I wanna see

02:18.666 --> 02:20.332

- What? Really?

02:20.333 --> 02:21.832

- Okay, okay.

02:21.833 --> 02:23.582
- All right, all right.
- Yeah, man, look at you.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.665
Healthy, wealthy, and wise. You look good.

02:25.666 --> 02:26.999
All right, listen, I think
we should check you in.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.249
- I did a thing online. I...
- Oh, no, I did it.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.124
- I checked in a while ago.
- Did you?

02:30.125 --> 02:31.915
- Yeah.
- Sorry. When did you get here?

02:31.916 --> 02:33.124
Few hours ago.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.207
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:34.208 --> 02:35.999
I mean, the flight's not
for another, like, two hours.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.457
Yeah, but they open
the airport super early.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.832
You can just come here and hang out.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.415
- Wow. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.415
You meet the craziest
fucking people here, dude.

02:42.416 --> 02:43.957
Oh. And did you eat anything?

02:43.958 --> 02:45.124
- I did. Yeah. No, yeah.
- Okay.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.207
Just 'cause I'm gonna wanna get something

02:46.208 --> 02:47.415
- before we take off.
- Don't worry about it, man.

02:47.416 --> 02:49.707
I got you a yogurt. It's a little warm.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.332
- Warm?
- It's been in my pocket.

02:51.333 --> 02:54.040
Shit, I don't have a spoon.
That's okay. You just sort of

02:54.041 --> 02:55.540
squeeze it, slurp it.

02:55.541 --> 02:57.000
Did you really get this for me?

02:57.333 --> 02:58.665
Yeah, of course, dude.

02:58.666 --> 02:59.832
- All right, you got your shit?
- Okay. Yeah.

02:59.833 --> 03:01.665
- You know what else?
- What?

03:01.666 --> 03:03.832
I also got some good shit
for when we land.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.415
Like, very, very good shit.

03:05.416 --> 03:06.999
Wait. You're not, like, taking
weed into Poland, are you?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.082
- Oh, yeah.
- Benji?

03:08.083 --> 03:09.165
They don't give a shit about
that stuff, man.

03:09.166 --> 03:10.249
- I'm telling you...
- Mm, I think they very much

03:10.250 --> 03:11.332
do give a shit about that stuff.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.415
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Really?
- Yeah.

03:12.416 --> 03:13.665
They're gonna arrest two Jews in Poland

03:13.666 --> 03:14.749
for a little bit of weed?

03:14.750 --> 03:15.832
That's a good look for the Polish people.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.165
Okay. All right. Just try
to keep it down, okay?

03:17.166 --> 03:19.083
Okay, yeah. Don't say "marijuana."

03:25.208 --> 03:26.499
-  Arms out.
-  Wait, really?

03:26.500 --> 03:29.000
Sorry. It doesn't normally... Thanks.

03:29.916 --> 03:31.832
This one? This little one?

03:31.833 --> 03:33.624
- It's a gift from my dad.
- Oh.

03:33.625 --> 03:34.749
- Dad?
- Yeah.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.707
Of course it was.

03:36.708 --> 03:37.790
Do you have something like this?

03:37.791 --> 03:38.874
- No way.
- Yeah.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.290
I don't... I was way off.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.374
Okay, bye.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.457
-  Bye.
- Bye.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.166
Oh. There you go.

03:46.291 --> 03:47.499
- She is so dope.
- Okay. Arms out.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.374
- Who?
- The TSA agent.

03:49.375 --> 03:50.915
Her dad does security for the Knicks.

03:50.916 --> 03:52.000
Huh.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.249
Did you want some?

04:04.250 --> 04:05.749
- Mm.
- Uh, Priya made it for me.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.499
-  Yeah, right.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:10.833 --> 04:12.666
What is that? A fucking Brazil nut?

04:14.416 --> 04:16.375
Yo. So, like, how you been, man?

04:18.208 --> 04:19.416
- Honestly, dude?
- Yeah.

04:20.833 --> 04:21.833
I've been...

04:23.416 --> 04:26.416
great. Been, like, really fucking great.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.166
Oh.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.707
You wanna go over our
tour itinerary or anything?

04:32.708 --> 04:33.791
Okay.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.208
Mm.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.165
Can you hold that for me, actually?

04:39.166 --> 04:40.249
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.958
- Have as much as you want.
- Yeah?

04:44.583 --> 04:45.749
Don't you think it'll be nice for us

04:45.750 --> 04:47.040
to see where Grandma was from?

04:47.041 --> 04:48.665
You know, where she lived?

04:48.666 --> 04:49.750
Mm-hmm.

04:50.875 --> 04:51.915
I can't even follow this.

04:51.916 --> 04:52.999
- I'll just...
- Sure.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.082
...do whatever the group does.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.166
Sure.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.374
Hi.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.458
What seat you got?

04:59.791 --> 05:01.082
Uh, 24 A.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.582
Mm. I'm B. I think
we're middle and window.

05:03.583 --> 05:04.665
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, man.

05:04.666 --> 05:06.625
- You mind taking middle?
- Um...

05:10.250 --> 05:11.457
How you feeling in there, dude?

05:11.458 --> 05:13.375
Uh, it's a little tight.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.290
- You still looking for a job?
- Nah.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.375
Hmm.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.790
So, you have to, like,
work the whole trip?

05:19.791 --> 05:21.582
No. No, no. I was able to take the week

05:21.583 --> 05:22.665
like, completely free.

05:22.666 --> 05:23.749
- I wanna be here.
- Great.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.249
I wanna be like...
You know, I wanna be present.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.707
- Good, man. Excellent.
- Yeah.

05:26.708 --> 05:27.790
You still, like,

05:27.791 --> 05:29.874
sellin' shit online?

05:29.875 --> 05:32.124
I mean, I don't, like,
sell used jerseys on eBay.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.915
I do, like, digital ad sales.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.040
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:35.041 --> 05:38.082
So, you know, when you see,
like, an ad banner online?

05:38.083 --> 05:39.457
Oh, yeah. God, I hate that shit.

05:39.458 --> 05:40.540
Hey, come on.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.624
No, no. No, I just mean, like,
everybody hates that shit,

05:42.625 --> 05:43.790
- you know. Mm, yeah.
- Do they?

05:43.791 --> 05:44.874
That's what I do. That's my job.

05:44.875 --> 05:45.957
- It's cool, man.
- I sell those.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.040
- It's cool. It's cool, dude.
- Okay.

05:47.041 --> 05:48.332
You're making the world
go around. It's fine.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.415
- Yeah.
- That's not your fault.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.665
You're just, like,
part of a fucked-up system.

05:51.666 --> 05:54.665
I mean, without online ads,
actually a lot of the websites

05:54.666 --> 05:56.290
that you visit for free
wouldn't be able to exist.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.082
It's kind of like
the lifeblood of the Internet.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.332
- Hey, dude, dude.
- Yeah.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.457
I think they want us to pay attention.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.082
Yeah, no, I just wanted
to, like, finish the story.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.624
Yeah, yeah. No. It's just...
It's just kind of rude, man.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.124
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.165
- Just trying to do their jobs.
<i>- To fasten your seatbelt,</i>

06:09.166 --> 06:10.874

07:09.291 --> 07:11.624
Oh. There's our guy. Yo. Dude.

07:11.625 --> 07:12.957

07:12.958 --> 07:14.041
Kaplans.

07:21.416 --> 07:22.708
What you looking at?

07:23.916 --> 07:25.791
I don't know. It's stupid. I don't...

07:26.541 --> 07:27.707
I think I'm already homesick.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.082
I don't know. It's just, uh, Abe.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.499
He's, like, obsessed with buildings now.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.374
He wants to know the height
of every skyscraper.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.624
It's kind of, like, all-encompassing.

07:34.625 --> 07:35.833
- Okay.
- Yeah.

07:36.666 --> 07:38.040
Let me see it?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.875
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

07:42.875 --> 07:43.915
<i>That's right.</i>

07:43.916 --> 07:45.915
<i>And how many floors

<i>Okay. How many floors

08:05.250 --> 08:06.666

08:10.875 --> 08:12.582
- You packed pajamas?
- Yeah, of course I did.

08:12.583 --> 08:13.665
- Two pairs.
- Really? But really?

08:13.666 --> 08:15.082
- You mean, like, the whole...
- You wanna borrow some?

08:15.083 --> 08:16.499
...like, what, Victorian nightgown

08:16.500 --> 08:17.707
with the slippers and the cap?

08:17.708 --> 08:19.707
No, man. I don't think I even own that.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.415
Hi. <i>Dzien Dobry.</i> Welcome
to the Warsaw Central Hotel.

08:22.416 --> 08:23.790
Thank you so much.
Yeah, we're checking in.

08:23.791 --> 08:25.332
We're with the, uh, Heritage Tour.

08:25.333 --> 08:28.540
Kaplan, Benjamin and David.
I have our passports here.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.290
- Yes, of course. Welcome.
- Thank you.

08:30.291 --> 08:32.249
You're the final ones to arrive.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.749
And I think I have a package for you.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.957
It's been sitting here for many days.

08:34.958 --> 08:36.082
That's for me, actually.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.290
- Okay.
- Thank you.

08:37.291 --> 08:38.790
- There you go.
- Thanks.

08:38.791 --> 08:40.040
You're on the fifth floor,

08:40.041 --> 08:42.249
and there's a group meeting in 30 minutes.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.457
- Thank you so much.
- Great. Thank you.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.290
Fifth floor? Thanks.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.457
What the hell is that?

08:46.458 --> 08:48.707
Oh, it's the weed. I told you.
It's, like, really good stuff.

08:48.708 --> 08:51.457
I got it from Todd.
This fucking barber in Ithaca.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.707
Wait. You mailed yourself weed?

08:53.708 --> 08:55.624
No, man. I mailed us weed.

08:55.625 --> 08:56.999
Are you serio... I thought you were, like,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.915
taking it through the airport.

08:58.916 --> 09:00.124
- Really?
- Yes, really.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.499
Did you not see how nervous I was?

09:01.500 --> 09:04.125
No, I did. I just thought that was you.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.957
I'm so fuckin' happy
to be here with you right now.

09:08.958 --> 09:10.958
Me too.

09:11.416 --> 09:13.250
Oh, God.

09:15.625 --> 09:16.749
All right. We got a half an hour.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.290
I'm gonna have to shower.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.583
Good idea.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.458
Sweet! Closet.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.665
Oh, yeah. Dude, I totally forgot.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.499
You have super nice feet.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.874
-  Do I?
- Yeah,

09:28.875 --> 09:30.415
and they've aged really well too.

09:30.416 --> 09:31.957
Toes are mad straight. It's nice.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.165
Um, okay. Thank you.

09:33.166 --> 09:34.290
No weird feet knuckles

09:34.291 --> 09:35.832
or stray hairs or anything. Very classy.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.165
Really?

09:37.166 --> 09:38.249
- Oh, yeah.
- That's interesting.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.457
I never really evaluated them, I guess.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.249
You never evaluated your own feet?

09:42.250 --> 09:43.499
- No.
- Come on, dude.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.915
They're graceful as fuck.

09:44.916 --> 09:46.874
Look at 'em. They remind me
of Grandma's feet.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.415
You remember Grandma's feet?

09:48.416 --> 09:49.499
'Course I remember Grandma's feet.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.999
She always wore those pink plastic

09:51.000 --> 09:52.582
fuckin' sandals from Target.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.332
She used to strut that shit all over town.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.416
Really?

09:55.750 --> 09:56.874
You know, sometimes I look at you.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.499
- Yeah?
- I see her.

09:59.708 --> 10:00.957
I look like an old Jewish woman?

10:00.958 --> 10:02.832
No, man, you look wise.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.832
And I don't know, it's beautiful.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.249
Thanks. All right. All right.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.457
- I'm gonna shower, okay?
- Cool.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.915
- Yeah.
- Mind if I shower first?

10:10.916 --> 10:11.999
Um, no, sure.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.624
Oh, hey, can I borrow your phone?

10:13.625 --> 10:15.291
Um, yeah, sure. For what?

10:15.666 --> 10:18.124
Just 'cause I like to listen
to music in the shower.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.457
Don't you have a phone?

10:19.458 --> 10:20.750
Yeah, but it doesn't play music.

10:21.375 --> 10:22.415
Um...

10:22.416 --> 10:23.749
Yeah, sure. Here you go.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.665
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.000
Shower time.

10:31.625 --> 10:34.040
<i>♪ All I need from you ♪</i>

10:34.041 --> 10:40.082

10:48.666 --> 10:50.500

10:51.166 --> 10:52.875

-  <i>Nie ma za co.</i>

10:53.666 --> 10:54.665
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi.

10:54.666 --> 10:55.874
Let me guess. David and Benjamin?

10:55.875 --> 10:57.040
- Hi, yeah. You're James?
- Yeah.

10:57.041 --> 10:58.540
- Hi, yes. I am James. Hi.
- Hey. How's it going?

10:58.541 --> 10:59.832
- Hi. Benji.
- Yeah.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.457
- You're Benji? Okay, hi.
- Benji. Yeah. Benji.

11:01.458 --> 11:02.957
Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to accost you.

11:02.958 --> 11:04.374
I just thought I should intercept

11:04.375 --> 11:05.707
in case you weren't sure where we were.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.374
-  Thanks.
- So, it's a nice, small group.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.999
- Should be intimate, you know.
- Nice. Great.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.415
Success, everybody, found them.

11:11.416 --> 11:12.957
- Hi.
- This is David and Benji.

11:12.958 --> 11:14.040
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.124
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.207
- Welcome.
- Sit down. Take a seat,

11:16.208 --> 11:18.082
- please. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot. Yeah.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.832
So, I won't ramble on for too long,

11:19.833 --> 11:21.124
but a word about myself.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.749
Hopefully, you won't be too sick of me

11:22.750 --> 11:25.000
by the end of the week.

11:26.291 --> 11:30.124
Er, so, my name is James, as you know.

11:30.125 --> 11:33.165
I will be your British
tour guide through Poland.

11:33.166 --> 11:36.582
I was a scholar of Eastern
European studies at Oxford.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.165
I'm not myself Jewish,

11:38.166 --> 11:39.915
but I'm completely obsessed

11:39.916 --> 11:41.249
with this whole part of the world,

11:41.250 --> 11:43.249
and in particular the Jewish experience,

11:43.250 --> 11:44.707
which I find to be

11:44.708 --> 11:47.999
fascinating and complex
and, at times, tragic,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.125
but ultimately beautiful.

11:50.625 --> 11:53.290
So, anyway, enough from me.
Shut up, James.

11:53.291 --> 11:54.999
Who wants to go next?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.250
Okay, I'll be brave. Ha!

11:57.875 --> 12:00.582
Um, hi. I'm Marcia Kramer.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.707
I'm originally from Brooklyn,

12:02.708 --> 12:06.499
um, with two regrettable
decades in Los Angeles,

12:06.500 --> 12:08.250
and I've just moved back to New York

12:08.958 --> 12:10.249
after a divorce.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.124
Sorry, if I'm oversharing,

12:12.125 --> 12:15.040
but I found that I was turning
into the kind of

12:15.041 --> 12:17.790
woman I detested.

12:17.791 --> 12:20.957
Just like a lady who lunches
basically, you know?

12:20.958 --> 12:22.249
Oof.

12:22.250 --> 12:25.541
My mother survived the camps and, uh,

12:26.500 --> 12:30.040
she never talked about it. Ever.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.333
So, I'm here to honor her.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.624
Okay, that's me. [chuckles] You go.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.207
Who's next?

12:37.208 --> 12:39.624
Well, hi. Diane and Mark Binder.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.790
Hello.

12:41.791 --> 12:44.624
Uh, we're boring.

12:44.625 --> 12:46.957
Recently retired from Shaker Heights.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.790
Mark's family was from here,
down in Lublin.

12:49.791 --> 12:52.499
Um, but they left way before the war.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.790
Turn of the century.

12:53.791 --> 12:55.874
We were Mayflower Jews.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.499
Was always my little joke.

12:58.833 --> 12:59.999
- Yeah. Funny.
- Um, hi.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.750
I'm Eloge. Um...

13:02.500 --> 13:05.957
As you might have guessed,
I was not born Jewish.

13:05.958 --> 13:08.832
Um, I guess you won't be the
only one on this trip, James.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.457
Happy for the company, Eloge.

13:10.458 --> 13:11.749
Happy for the company.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.332
But, um, I did convert to
Judaism, around 10 years ago.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.041
I'm actually African-born, um, Rwandan.

13:18.916 --> 13:20.749
And to answer the question

13:20.750 --> 13:22.290
maybe you are thinking of asking,

13:22.291 --> 13:24.290
I... I am a survivor of the genocide.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.541
Oh, snap.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.249
Sorry. No, I just meant...

13:28.250 --> 13:29.916
No, that's like... I meant
that in a good way. Like...

13:30.291 --> 13:31.582
I don't know if
you're familiar with "snap."

13:31.583 --> 13:33.082
It's like, "Oh, shit." "Oh, wow."

13:33.083 --> 13:34.290
"Holy..." You know...

13:34.291 --> 13:36.207
I'm just interested in people
from other places.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.958
It's like... I'm a fan,
basically. Keep going, dude.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.540
- I'm sorry about that.
- No. No, no, no.

13:41.541 --> 13:44.082
I'm very happy when people
are interested in my country.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.165
- Oh.
- Sweet.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.790
- What's your name?
- Benji.

13:46.791 --> 13:49.665
- Benji, I'm an open book.
- Oh, rad.

13:49.666 --> 13:52.749
Um, so my mother and I
survived the genocide.

13:52.750 --> 13:56.832
And, um, I moved to Winnipeg
with her life savings

13:56.833 --> 13:58.290
sewn into the inside of my jacket...

13:58.291 --> 14:00.999
-  Jesus. Fuck.
- And, um, in Winnipeg,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.915
I found a connection there
with a Jewish community.

14:03.916 --> 14:05.457
Yeah, well, naturally.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.832
Yes, naturally, Benji.

14:07.833 --> 14:11.415
And, um, when I learned
about the Jewish story, I...

14:11.416 --> 14:14.165
I felt at peace for
the first time since the war.

14:14.166 --> 14:17.250
And the more I learn,
and the more people I meet...

14:18.250 --> 14:20.125
wonderful people such as yourselves,

14:20.916 --> 14:23.166
the more I know I made the right decision.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.875
Wow.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.874
Well, I didn't expect to be crying

14:28.875 --> 14:29.957
before the tour started.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.249
- Wow. That's extraordinary.
- Wow.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.707
Thank you so much for that, Eloge.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.040
-  Yeah.
- Thank you.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.249
That was beautiful.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.665
Well, who the hell wants to follow that?

14:38.666 --> 14:40.082
Yeah.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.999
Okay, shit. I guess I'll go.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.415
So, um, Davers and I are cousins. We've...

14:46.416 --> 14:48.374
Actually, we were born three weeks apart,

14:48.375 --> 14:49.790
- which is kinda nuts.
- Yes.

14:49.791 --> 14:51.290
A zloty for anyone who can guess

14:51.291 --> 14:52.790
which one of us is older.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.040
Me!

14:54.041 --> 14:55.374
Our dads are brothers.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.665
Uh, we're basically brothers,
too, wouldn't you say, Dave?

14:57.666 --> 14:58.832
We used to be joined at the hip.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.540
Like feckin' Katie and Eilish.

15:00.541 --> 15:02.082
-  Remember them?
- Yeah. Don't say that.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.415
But, um, our grandma, Dory...

15:04.416 --> 15:06.499
Grandma Dory, she was from here. Um...

15:06.500 --> 15:08.749
And we've always wanted to

15:08.750 --> 15:09.999
see where she came from

15:10.000 --> 15:11.999
and... and see the house
that she grew up in.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.415
Yeah, that's actually
why we're leaving the tour

15:13.416 --> 15:14.874
- a day early.
- Yeah. 'Course, yeah.

15:14.875 --> 15:15.999
Benji insisted on seeing her little town.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.582
- We have to.
- They were super close.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.749
Yeah. I mean, she was
the fucking coolest, right?

15:19.750 --> 15:21.790
Well, now I've just been, like,

15:21.791 --> 15:23.624
in a real funk, I guess, since she died.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.083
Just haven't, um...

15:29.666 --> 15:31.207
Yeah. Sorry. She was
just my favorite person

15:31.208 --> 15:32.625
in the world. Uh...

15:36.166 --> 15:38.040
You know, it's... it's good to remember.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.166
That's why we're here, in a way. So...

15:41.250 --> 15:42.708
Thank you, James. Thanks for saying that.

15:43.958 --> 15:46.665
Um... So... Yeah, it's okay.

15:46.666 --> 15:48.707
Just to, like, just keep
things on track, though.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.915
- Yeah.
- Like... Sorry. When she died,

15:50.916 --> 15:52.249
she left some money in her will

15:52.250 --> 15:53.457
for me and Benji to come here, so...

15:53.458 --> 15:55.499
Yeah, and Dave is always,
like, super busy.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.582
He never has time.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.749
He's got this, like, high-pressure job

15:57.750 --> 15:59.457
selling fucking ad banners
to the Internet.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.540
Yo, come on, man.

16:00.541 --> 16:03.166
But he knew I was in a real
shit place recently, so he...

16:03.833 --> 16:05.707
swooped in and dropped everything

16:05.708 --> 16:07.582
and arranged for us to join this...

16:07.583 --> 16:09.832
- Mm-hmm.
- ...geriatric Polish tour

16:09.833 --> 16:11.332
with you fine people.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.790
Hey.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.457
Okay, if everyone could gather over here

16:48.458 --> 16:50.375
just for a moment, please? No rush.

16:56.375 --> 16:58.915
I always like to start my tours here

16:58.916 --> 17:01.332
at the Ghetto Uprising Memorial.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.207
And that's because this is a monument

17:03.208 --> 17:04.790
that celebrates the Jewish heroes

17:04.791 --> 17:06.750
who fought back against the Nazis.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.457
In a couple of days,

17:08.458 --> 17:10.374
I will be taking us
to a concentration camp,

17:10.375 --> 17:13.124
so I think it's important
to immediately dispel the myth

17:13.125 --> 17:14.957
that these were a people who were led

17:14.958 --> 17:16.625
like lambs to the slaughter.

17:17.291 --> 17:20.166
Now, it may seem obvious,
but a word of warnin',

17:21.125 --> 17:23.082
this will be a tour about pain.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.457
Of course, it will.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.832
Pain and suffering and loss,

17:25.833 --> 17:26.999
there's no getting around that,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.582
but I think it's important
that it's also a tour

17:29.583 --> 17:31.125
that celebrates a people.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.833
A most resilient people.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.375
All right.

17:40.541 --> 17:41.875
So, that's that one then.

17:45.083 --> 17:48.832
This city has an incredibly
unfortunate history.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.832
It's often called the Phoenix City

17:50.833 --> 17:53.999
because it's risen
from the ashes so many times.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.832
Functionality of this
Soviet-style architecture,

17:56.833 --> 17:58.457
you know, can be polarizing.

17:58.458 --> 17:59.624
It's not to everyone's...

17:59.625 --> 18:02.290
And again, you'll notice
that austere style

18:02.291 --> 18:04.291
which sprung up
in the wake of World War II.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.374
Look at this shit.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.332
We'd probably live here
if the war didn't happen.

18:08.333 --> 18:09.750
Isn't that fucking crazy to think about?

18:10.416 --> 18:11.749
Seriously, like,

18:11.750 --> 18:12.999
we think of ourselves as these, like,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.457
very American creations, you know?

18:14.458 --> 18:15.540
And I guess that we are.

18:15.541 --> 18:17.290
I guess, that's, like,
the essence of America,

18:17.291 --> 18:19.082
people created from other cultures.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.332
But, like, in some parallel,
black hole universe,

18:21.333 --> 18:23.415
you and I are Polish
and we probably got, like,

18:23.416 --> 18:25.249
long beards and we can't
shake hands with women.

18:25.250 --> 18:26.874
Yeah, that's funny.
You know, every time I see,

18:26.875 --> 18:28.374
like, one of those
Hasidic guys on the street,

18:28.375 --> 18:29.457
I always just think, like,

18:29.458 --> 18:31.165
"There but for the grace of no God go I."

18:31.166 --> 18:32.915
- You know?
- What?

18:32.916 --> 18:35.165
Oh, nothing. It's just, like,
a dumb joke that...

18:35.166 --> 18:37.416
- Mm. Well, that's cool, man.
- Yeah.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.415
- Shit, look at her.
- Who?

18:40.416 --> 18:41.749
That woman, Marcia.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.541
She's walkin' alone.
We should go talk to her.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.624
We just met her.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.082
Yeah, but she's got this, like,

18:47.083 --> 18:48.957
deep sadness behind her eyes, you know?

18:48.958 --> 18:50.082
She does?

18:50.083 --> 18:51.250
Yeah. You didn't notice that?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.540
During the introductions? No. I...

18:53.541 --> 18:54.874
I think we should check on her.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.291
Benji, maybe she wants to be alone.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.290
No one wants to be alone, Dave.

18:58.291 --> 18:59.832
Okay, I'm gonna go check it out.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.874
Hey. Why are you walking alone?

19:01.875 --> 19:03.624
Are you a big fucking loser?

19:03.625 --> 19:04.874
-  Seriously?
- Yeah.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.166
You look like an interesting person.

19:06.583 --> 19:07.875
- Sorry.
- Okay.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.624
This is one of the most
well-preserved sections

19:10.625 --> 19:12.707
of the Warsaw Ghetto
and was part of the wall

19:12.708 --> 19:17.332
from November 1940 to November 1942.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.457
And, as we traverse the city,

19:19.458 --> 19:21.333
you'll actually notice the fact that...

19:22.291 --> 19:23.375
<i>Gracias.</i>

19:24.125 --> 19:27.915
Here you go. Water.
Diane. Mark. There we go.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.333
Gotta drink. It's important. James, Eloge.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.833
Marcia, hydrate.

19:42.458 --> 19:43.708
Okay. Ready to go?

19:44.541 --> 19:45.541
What we waitin' on?

19:48.500 --> 19:51.583
New Delhi has no delis
in it. Where are the knishes?

19:53.875 --> 19:57.291
Oh, it was the airport,
but it wasn't new, it was old.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.999
Yo!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.083
Hey.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.375
Come on in.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.790
- Thanks.
- Thanks?

20:06.791 --> 20:08.082
Yeah. No, I mean, I saved this.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.790
I don't know if you were gonna...

20:09.791 --> 20:11.000
- yeah, sit over there.
- No, man.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.707
So, what was going on with that woman?

20:14.708 --> 20:16.082
What do you mean?

20:16.083 --> 20:18.707
The woman with, like,
the "sadness in her eyes."

20:18.708 --> 20:20.165
- Mm, Marcia.
- Yeah. Is she all right?

20:20.166 --> 20:21.540
She's in a really weird place right now.

20:21.541 --> 20:22.624
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

20:22.625 --> 20:23.999
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.165
I guess she thinks that I can relate

20:25.166 --> 20:26.374
since we've both lost people.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.707
Yeah. You mean our grandma?

20:27.708 --> 20:28.999
Yeah. She's just, like,

20:29.000 --> 20:30.249
super fucking stressed right now

20:30.250 --> 20:31.832
because her husband left her last May,

20:31.833 --> 20:33.624
like, totally out of the blue.

20:33.625 --> 20:34.957
- Jesus.
- Mm.

20:34.958 --> 20:36.165
She's seeing this new guy, Darren,

20:36.166 --> 20:37.415
which you'd think she'd be happy about,

20:37.416 --> 20:38.999
but he sounds like
a total fucking douchebag.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.250
Really? How?

20:41.500 --> 20:43.665
Mm. I don't know, man. I don't think

20:43.666 --> 20:45.458
we should be talking about her
behind her back.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.707
Okay. I mean, I was just...

20:47.708 --> 20:50.250
- I was just asking.
- I know. But... still.

20:53.666 --> 20:55.125
Weird soup, right?

20:55.833 --> 20:56.958
I fucking love it.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.249
When it comes
to the Warsaw Uprising,

21:03.250 --> 21:06.290
I think the most bizarre
and harrowing aspect

21:06.291 --> 21:08.540
is not the German crushing
of the rebellion,

21:08.541 --> 21:11.082
but the part that the Russians
played in it.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.832
You see, the Russians and the Poles

21:12.833 --> 21:14.332
were supposedly allies.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.750
Brothers in arms fighting
against a common enemy.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.458
I'm sure you'd like
to take some photographs.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.165
Please don't hesitate
to ask me any questions.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.915
Always happy to fill you in...

21:23.916 --> 21:25.665
-  You like that guy?
-  Yeah.

21:25.666 --> 21:27.832
Hey, um, Eloge, when you're done...

21:27.833 --> 21:29.582
sorry, could you get a picture
of me and Dave

21:29.583 --> 21:31.250
- posing with the guys?
- Yeah, of course.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.582
- Thank you, man.
-  Sorry, what?

21:33.583 --> 21:35.749
Uh, we should pose with
the guys. It'll be hysterical.

21:35.750 --> 21:38.624
Uh, doesn't that seem, like,
disrespectful or...

21:38.625 --> 21:40.665
Fuck is that disrespectful?
We're on their side.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.540
Fightin' the fucking Russkies
and the Krauts. Come on.

21:42.541 --> 21:43.957
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah, I don't...

21:43.958 --> 21:45.540
Uh, I don't really know if we should.

21:45.541 --> 21:47.207
Can you just get a picture of me, then,

21:47.208 --> 21:48.999
fighting with my Polish brethren?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.082
Uh, yeah.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.583
Gentlemen, I'm goin' in.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.041
No, that's the leaves.

21:54.541 --> 21:55.915
Sorry, I'm late. Got a war to win,

21:55.916 --> 21:57.083
or to lose, probably.

21:58.375 --> 21:59.749
That's really...
You look great, Benji.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.665
- Got some good shots.
- Does it look real?

22:01.666 --> 22:04.040
Well, uh, they're twice
the size of you and metal.

22:04.041 --> 22:05.540
So, you know, no.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.124
I need some help. You wanna come up here?

22:07.125 --> 22:08.666
No, I'm good. I'm good. Really.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.832
Eloge! You gonna enlist?

22:10.833 --> 22:12.749
I'm not a fighter, Benji. Thank you.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.207
Okay, well, then, you can be
a medic or something.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.291
These people need help.

22:16.041 --> 22:17.624
- This is so silly.
- I know.

22:17.625 --> 22:19.291
Come on. Your mom
will love the pictures.

22:20.625 --> 22:21.665
Can you take my picture for me, please?

22:21.666 --> 22:23.875
Come on. Hey, Marcia.

22:24.375 --> 22:25.582
- Just one.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

22:25.583 --> 22:27.457
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.999
So, you're the medic, you
gotta patch up this guy's leg.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.415
- Okay.
- He's in a lot of pain.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.250
- Okay. Uh...
- He really needs you.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.082
Need to reassure him as well. Talk to him.

22:35.083 --> 22:36.707
Don't worry, I'm... I'm here to help.

22:36.708 --> 22:37.915
Oh, you're taking such good care.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.665
We got a young
Florrie Nightingale over here.

22:39.666 --> 22:40.957
Dave, you gettin' all this?

22:40.958 --> 22:42.415
- Yeah, I got it.
-  Is it funny?

22:42.416 --> 22:44.124
Um, yeah, it's funny. Yeah.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.332
You sure you don't wanna come up here?

22:45.333 --> 22:46.540
We could use the manpower.

22:46.541 --> 22:47.999
No, that's okay. I'll just, um...

22:48.000 --> 22:49.624
You know, I'll watch from central command.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.165
Central...

22:51.166 --> 22:52.499
Central command. That's a good one, Dave.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.582
Can I join up?

22:53.583 --> 22:55.457
General Marcus.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.915
We're honored to have you, sir.

22:56.916 --> 22:57.999
-  At ease.
-  Marcia.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.332
- Okay. Thank you.
-  Get on up here!

22:59.333 --> 23:00.624
Marcia, I need more supplies.

23:00.625 --> 23:01.999
Yeah. Wanna be a medic too?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.124
No, I don't wanna be a medic.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.249
Don't I have a gun or something?

23:04.250 --> 23:05.499
Fuckin' A. Look at you.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.665
Oh, God. I can't believe I'm
doing this. Thank you, David.

23:07.666 --> 23:08.749
No, sure. No problem.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.165
Are you sure you don't wanna go up there?

23:10.166 --> 23:11.707
No, it's fine.
I got some good shots earlier

23:11.708 --> 23:12.791
when it was, like, empty.

23:13.208 --> 23:17.082
Jimothy! Sir, we need a gunner
from the RAF, old chap.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.165
I'm coming!

23:20.833 --> 23:22.582
Gonna be dropped out of the plane.

23:22.583 --> 23:23.790
Or are you the actual plane?

23:23.791 --> 23:25.082
I guess I am the plane.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.166
Then you're a plane.

23:28.916 --> 23:30.874
Okay, Dave, you ready?

23:30.875 --> 23:32.250
Everybody, pick a pose and freeze.

23:45.416 --> 23:47.290
You gettin' this, Dave?
My arm's gettin' pretty tired.

23:47.291 --> 23:48.999
Yeah. It's
my last phone. One second.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.332
Okay. Okay, I got it.

23:50.333 --> 23:51.749
Okay, stand down, men.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.457
We were all very brave.
Unfortunately, we all...

23:53.458 --> 23:55.540
A whole elaborate story unfolding there.

23:55.541 --> 23:56.832
My knees.

23:56.833 --> 23:58.832
Thank you so much, man.
That was a lot of fun. Thanks.

23:58.833 --> 23:59.915
No problem. No, it was, like...

23:59.916 --> 24:01.207
- That was fun.
- It was so much fun.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.165
You are? Okay.

24:05.166 --> 24:07.207
Well, let me know
if you need any help with

24:07.208 --> 24:08.999
- any recommendations...
-  Nice.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.458
All right, well done, everyone.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.541
It's fantastic.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.707
This is us. Good night, you freaks.

24:21.708 --> 24:22.874
- Night.
- Night.

24:22.875 --> 24:24.125
Long day tomorrow.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.540
- Hey, Dave?
- Yep.

24:31.541 --> 24:33.083
Come meet me in the bathroom for a second.

24:33.875 --> 24:34.958
What? Why?

24:37.208 --> 24:39.040
- Hi.
- Hey.

24:39.041 --> 24:41.249
So, um, why are we in here?

24:41.250 --> 24:43.457
So, I just wanted to say

24:43.458 --> 24:46.332
thank you so much for being here with me.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.207
I know that it's tough for you
to take time off work

24:48.208 --> 24:49.833
and to leave your boy...

24:51.041 --> 24:52.499
but I really needed this, man.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.957
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:53.958 --> 24:56.040
Well, that's... that's great, man.

24:56.041 --> 24:59.124
I'm, like, just happy to see you happy.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.207
I know it's been, like, such
a tough few months for you...

25:01.208 --> 25:02.290
I also want to say that

25:02.291 --> 25:03.832
I know you're not
the most comfortable person

25:03.833 --> 25:06.915
with groups and people
and social shit like that.

25:06.916 --> 25:07.999
- I'm not?
- No.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.332
But it's amazing that you're here,

25:10.333 --> 25:12.125
putting yourself out there
so boldly for me.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.791
- Well, thank you, man.
- Let's go smoke a joint.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.707
Yep. Infantilizing, corporate bullshit.

25:21.708 --> 25:22.790
What do you mean?

25:22.791 --> 25:24.249
How the fuck are we supposed
to smoke a joint in here?

25:24.250 --> 25:25.832
They fuckin' locked the windows.

25:25.833 --> 25:27.290
It's like a goddamn police state.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.040
Yo, man. I think I might just wanna crash.

25:29.041 --> 25:30.290
We've been up for, like, 24 hours.

25:30.291 --> 25:32.124
Don't. Don't tell me
you're gonna sleep on me.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.874
This is our first night
together in fuckin' years.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.499
I don't know. I'm exhausted.
I haven't showered.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.540
You're exhausted? Dude, the
weed's gonna help you sleep.

25:37.541 --> 25:39.457
Is it the kind that helps you sleep?

25:39.458 --> 25:41.500
- No, it's the other kind.
-  Come on.

25:41.958 --> 25:42.957
- Dude.
- What?

25:42.958 --> 25:44.999
Take a shower, brush your fuckin' face.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.374
Like, floss your butt.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.082
Do whatever it is
you gotta do to feel like you.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.290
-  Yeah.
- I'm gonna roll us

25:49.291 --> 25:50.624
a fat fuckin' joint,

25:50.625 --> 25:52.333
and we'll go to the roof. Okay?

26:01.250 --> 26:04.082
Okay. Where are ya?

26:04.083 --> 26:05.915
I don't know. Maybe they don't
make their roof accessible

26:05.916 --> 26:07.999
for American assholes
trying to smoke weed?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.832
I think this might be it.
Think this is it?

26:09.833 --> 26:11.999
I think there's a big fucking
alarm that's gonna go off.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.082
So? If it goes off,

26:13.083 --> 26:14.499
we just say we don't speak Polish.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.040
Which happens to be true.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.957
Huh. I think... I don't know, man.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.708
I think we should probably
just go back down.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.541
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.958
Yeah. I... I don't feel right about this.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.332
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.499
Yeah, If you're not feeling good about it,

26:29.500 --> 26:30.665
- let's not do it.
- Sorry. I don't know.

26:30.666 --> 26:31.749
That's lame, I guess.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.207
No, that's okay.
It's not lame. It's just...

26:33.208 --> 26:34.665
Benji!

26:47.208 --> 26:49.000
Hustle. We're almost there.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.332
Yeah. There's my guy.

26:59.333 --> 27:00.832
How you feeling, dude?

27:00.833 --> 27:02.416
Um, I feel okay.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.166
Feel okay.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.374
- David.
- Yeah?

27:06.375 --> 27:07.499
How are you feeling, man?

27:07.500 --> 27:09.165
-  No, I feel good.
- Yeah?

27:09.166 --> 27:10.540
Yeah. I feel good.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.207
You just needed a little drugs
in your system. That's all.

27:12.208 --> 27:13.290
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.457
That's all I was missing, huh?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.874
- That's all you were missin'.
- There you go.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.040
That's it.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.125
You...

27:20.125 --> 27:21.957
are like an awesome guy

27:21.958 --> 27:23.124
stuck inside the body of somebody

27:23.125 --> 27:24.374
who's always running late.

27:24.375 --> 27:27.124
I gotta fish that fuckin' guy out of you

27:27.125 --> 27:28.582
every time I see you.

27:28.583 --> 27:30.749
Thank you, I think.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.832
You know, dude, when I think
about the two of us, man...

27:32.833 --> 27:33.916
Yeah?

27:34.375 --> 27:36.290
I think of us walking around
New York all night,

27:36.291 --> 27:37.999
trying to stay up until morning.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.665
- Mm. You always did.
- Mm-hmm.

27:40.666 --> 27:42.332
- Yeah.
- And you always passed out

27:42.333 --> 27:43.750
- halfway through.
- Mm.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.290
We'd make it over the Williamsburg Bridge

27:46.291 --> 27:49.874
and you would conk out
on a bench in Chinatown.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.125
Yeah, I know.

27:53.041 --> 27:54.375
You're kind of a lightweight.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.250
Dave?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Yo.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.041
Sorry I called you a lightweight.

28:26.750 --> 28:27.750
That's okay.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.124
I'm sorry I would always fall asleep.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.874
Nah, man.

28:31.875 --> 28:33.875
You had, like, a job and a wife.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.874
You'd been awake all day

28:36.875 --> 28:38.583
doing important shit.

28:39.291 --> 28:41.125
I didn't really have anything going on.

28:43.291 --> 28:44.540
I didn't care that you fell asleep, man.

28:44.541 --> 28:46.041
I was just glad you were there.

29:22.958 --> 29:23.957
What did he say?

29:23.958 --> 29:25.040
<i>Just absolutely despising.</i>

29:25.041 --> 29:26.124
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

29:26.125 --> 29:27.790
<i>That was a bit of a disaster
if you ask me, but...</i>

29:27.791 --> 29:28.958
That's really funny.

29:29.625 --> 29:30.624
Benji.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.249
-  Mm. Mm-hmm.
-  We gotta go.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.166
- The train's in an hour, okay?
- Mm.

29:39.333 --> 29:40.415
Sorry we're a little late.

29:40.416 --> 29:43.415
Yeah, Dave woke me up
literally two minutes ago.

29:43.416 --> 29:44.500
All right.

29:56.708 --> 29:58.416
Train's arriving in two minutes. Come on.

30:00.333 --> 30:01.332
I really appreciate it.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.707
You're okay?

30:02.708 --> 30:05.166
I know it's kind of heavy. Sorry.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.249
Right. Come on, everyone.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.165
Gotta get right
to the end of the platform.

30:11.541 --> 30:14.624
Okay, everyone,
so, part of our tour package

30:14.625 --> 30:16.665
included these first-class tickets.

30:16.666 --> 30:17.832
Whoo.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.957
Nice little perk for us all. Keep coming.

30:19.958 --> 30:21.624
We gotta get right to the end, everyone.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.082
I like a first-class ticket.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.041
Love the exchange rate.

30:25.625 --> 30:26.791
Excuse me.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.332
Now, if you've got time,

30:34.333 --> 30:36.166
we could swing by Underground Lublin.

30:36.666 --> 30:37.874
Erm, it is fascinating.

30:37.875 --> 30:39.625
I just think it's
a bit overhyped, personally.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.332
The big hitter is
the Grodzka Gate, you know.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.249
Oh. Is the gate still accessible?

30:44.250 --> 30:45.582
Yo, dude, I think we should move.

30:45.583 --> 30:46.665
What?

30:46.666 --> 30:48.332
I think we should move
to another train car.

30:48.333 --> 30:49.499
What do you mean?

30:49.500 --> 30:51.458
You don't feel weird
being in a first-class car?

30:51.875 --> 30:53.624
- Uh, no. We paid for it.
- No?

30:53.625 --> 30:54.999
It's not hurting anybody, no.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.207
Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland.

30:57.208 --> 30:58.290
Fucking think about it.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.957
- I am. I'm...
-  Benji?

30:59.958 --> 31:01.082
- Benji.
- Yeah?

31:01.083 --> 31:02.415
You all right up there?

31:02.416 --> 31:03.790
- Yeah. Sure.
-  Yeah.

31:03.791 --> 31:05.749
-  Sorry.
-  Yeah, no. No worries.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.707
I mean, you know, it's,
to be fair, fascinating...

31:07.708 --> 31:08.957
No, I mean, I just feel like... Sorry.

31:08.958 --> 31:10.040
- Okay.
- I just... Does any...

31:10.041 --> 31:12.416
Is anyone else, like,
feeling this right now?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.082
Feeling what?

31:14.083 --> 31:15.832
Like this creepy feeling that,
like, you know,

31:15.833 --> 31:18.040
we're, like, royalty on this train?

31:18.041 --> 31:19.915
I mean, does no one else
see the irony here?

31:19.916 --> 31:21.749
- Jesus. Benji, come on, man.
- Like eating fancy food

31:21.750 --> 31:23.957
and sitting up here, when 80 years ago,

31:23.958 --> 31:25.290
we would've been herded into the backs

31:25.291 --> 31:26.749
of these fucking things like cattle.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.249
- God.
- Okay, Benji,

31:28.250 --> 31:30.124
I don't think anybody here
wants to hear that right now.

31:30.125 --> 31:32.082
Okay, why not? Why doesn't
anyone want to hear it?

31:32.083 --> 31:33.332
- Because it's depressing, man.
- Depressing?

31:33.333 --> 31:34.415
Okay, look. That's okay.

31:34.416 --> 31:36.040
You're raising an interesting
sensitivity here.

31:36.041 --> 31:37.999
It does sometimes come up on these tours.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.707
You're staying in fancy hotels,

31:39.708 --> 31:41.207
eating posh food, and at the same time,

31:41.208 --> 31:42.790
you're looking back

31:42.791 --> 31:44.540
at the horrors of your family history.

31:44.541 --> 31:46.707
It can conjure up confusing feelings

31:46.708 --> 31:48.582
of discomfort and discordance

31:48.583 --> 31:51.499
and dare I say, even
a kinda guilt, you know.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.915
You're comparing your own life...

31:52.916 --> 31:54.082
I don't feel guilt.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.290
- No. Nor should you, Mark.
- Why would I feel guilt?

31:56.291 --> 31:57.624
No, I'm not saying
that you have to feel guilt.

31:57.625 --> 31:58.707
Well, because our lives

31:58.708 --> 32:00.124
are so fucking pampered and privileged.

32:00.125 --> 32:01.915
Like, we completely cut ourselves off

32:01.916 --> 32:03.582
from anyone else's true pain.

32:03.583 --> 32:05.374
Like the actual fuckin' experience

32:05.375 --> 32:06.749
of being shoved in a train car,

32:06.750 --> 32:08.332
- your fuckin' head bashed in.
- Jesus, Benji.

32:08.333 --> 32:09.499
So what are we supposed to do about that?

32:09.500 --> 32:11.457
- Mark. Mark, Mark, please.
- Fuckin' acknowledge it, man.

32:11.458 --> 32:12.707
Like, try to feel it in some way.

32:12.708 --> 32:13.790
Why are you doing this?

32:13.791 --> 32:15.124
Dude, I'm just fuckin' saying how I feel.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.625
Okay. Why is that, like, important now?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.999
Oh, man, you used to, like,
feel everything, man.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.749
He was such an anxious,
adorable fucking kid, man.

32:22.750 --> 32:23.957
-  Jesus, Benji.
- We went to Jewy

32:23.958 --> 32:25.207
- sleep-away camp together.
- Come on, man.

32:25.208 --> 32:26.624
He cried the whole first week.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.832
The whole fucking first week
'cause he was homesick.

32:28.833 --> 32:29.999
- Jesus.
- I used to have to hug him

32:30.000 --> 32:31.707
to sleep and talk about
his sweet fuckin' mom

32:31.708 --> 32:33.124
to calm him down and shit.
Now look at him.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.207
Jesus Christ, man. What the fuck?

32:34.208 --> 32:36.082
He's like all put together
and comfortable and shit.

32:36.083 --> 32:39.124
Topiaries his wild-ass Jew fro
into submission.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.874
It's mad impressive.
You're all mad impressive.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.165
But you know what?

32:42.166 --> 32:43.916
I'm gonna go to the back
of the train now, okay?

32:44.500 --> 32:46.415
I don't think you'll find much
suffering back there either.

32:46.416 --> 32:47.708
Stop it. Please.

32:49.708 --> 32:51.500
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

32:53.250 --> 32:56.332
Okay, I hope that wasn't too
uncomfortable for everyone.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.040
Obviously, there are

32:58.041 --> 33:00.415
triggers along the way with this tour.

33:00.416 --> 33:02.790
I must say the train is not
normally one of them, but...

33:02.791 --> 33:03.957
Um...

33:03.958 --> 33:05.457
James, I should probably head back there.

33:05.458 --> 33:06.665
I don't know. I should at least, like,

33:06.666 --> 33:07.874
bring him his food or something.

33:07.875 --> 33:09.915
Of course. Yeah. You
know where we're gettin' off?

33:09.916 --> 33:12.040
Uh, yeah, it's, like, Lublin Główny?

33:12.041 --> 33:13.207
I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.332
No. It's very close.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.624
- Yeah, it's... All right.
- Okay, thanks. Sorry.

33:15.625 --> 33:16.833
-  Good luck.
- Sorry, everybody.

33:17.791 --> 33:20.416
Okay. Erm...

33:46.250 --> 33:47.666
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

33:48.541 --> 33:49.541
Thanks.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.333
Are you okay?

33:53.166 --> 33:55.625
Everyone just wants to have
a fucking joyride, you know?

33:56.833 --> 33:58.375
No. What do you mean?

33:59.625 --> 34:01.791
People can't walk
around the world being...

34:02.916 --> 34:04.500
happy all the time.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.541
It's okay, man.

34:24.333 --> 34:27.249
<i>Przypominamy
o zabraniu bagaży.</i>

34:27.250 --> 34:29.624
<i>Prosimy o zachowanie

34:29.625 --> 34:31.415

34:39.416 --> 34:40.999
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.374
Did I fall asleep?

34:42.375 --> 34:44.332
- Yeah, you did.
- Oh, shit.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.040
Oh, shit! We gotta go.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.208
We gotta go. Come on.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.875
All right, I guess everybody's
waiting in front for us.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.290
Mm-hmm. Maybe.

34:59.291 --> 35:01.082
- Uh, hey, duder?
- Yeah?

35:01.083 --> 35:03.125
Yeah, we're not
at the right station, dude.

35:04.166 --> 35:05.249
Sorry, what?

35:05.250 --> 35:06.333
Yeah.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.415
Oh, shit. What the fuck is Kraśnik?

35:10.416 --> 35:11.499
Yeah, Kraśnik.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.749
We were supposed to get off at Lublin.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.582
No, I know. Yeah. You were out
pretty fucking cold, dude.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.415
Sorry. You mean we...
we passed Lublin already?

35:17.416 --> 35:18.499
Like, a while ago.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.624
And you didn't wake me up?

35:19.625 --> 35:21.374
Oh, you were having such a good nap, dude.

35:21.375 --> 35:22.790
Jesus Christ! We're on
a tour group with people.

35:22.791 --> 35:23.915
You were, like... I'm sorry. Yeah, I know.

35:23.916 --> 35:25.249
I just didn't have
the heart to wake you up, man.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.124
You have, like, the most
fucked-up sense of priorities.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.499
Do you know that? Do you know that?

35:28.500 --> 35:29.915
Dude, don't get mad at me. Okay?

35:29.916 --> 35:30.999
How could I not get mad at you?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.082
Because I was, like, staring at you

35:32.083 --> 35:33.415
- while you were sleeping...
- Yeah.

35:33.416 --> 35:34.582
...and people were lookin' at you.

35:34.583 --> 35:36.082
And some people
were fucking laughing at you

35:36.083 --> 35:38.374
'cause you were snoring
all weird and loud and shit.

35:38.375 --> 35:40.250
But I was thinkin', like, "Fuck that."

35:40.708 --> 35:42.290
This is my cousin Davey.
I'm not ashamed of him.

35:42.291 --> 35:44.332
This is Davey on the bench in Chinatown.

35:44.333 --> 35:45.874
This is the guy
I used to have all to myself.

35:45.875 --> 35:47.333
I just couldn't wake you, man.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.415
All right. All right, so...

35:50.416 --> 35:51.915
- so what do we do now?
- Oh, yeah. Got that shit

35:51.916 --> 35:52.999
- worked out, dude.
- Did you?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.083
Yeah, while you were sleepin'.

35:54.458 --> 35:56.124
- Okay.
- So we just get on a train

35:56.125 --> 35:57.332
going in the opposite direction.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.707
- Yeah, okay.
- And we don't even have to pay

35:58.708 --> 36:00.249
for tickets. We just avoid the
conductor until we get there.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.749
I do this kinda shit all the time Upstate.

36:01.750 --> 36:03.290
It's fucking foolproof.
This might be us, dude.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.374
- Really?
- Run! Run, run, run.

36:04.375 --> 36:05.708
Great.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.999
Yo, we should just buy tickets
like normal people.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.416
There's no time. Come on.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.333
Shit.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.125
Dude.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.332
We stay moving, we stay light,

36:19.333 --> 36:20.415
- we stay agile.
- Yeah.

36:20.416 --> 36:21.915
The conductor's gonna
come through taking tickets.

36:21.916 --> 36:23.040
We tell him we're going to the bathroom.

36:23.041 --> 36:24.207
- The bathroom? Okay.
- He gets to the back

36:24.208 --> 36:25.332
of the train, he's gonna start heading

36:25.333 --> 36:26.540
towards the front looking for stragglers.

36:26.541 --> 36:27.790
- Sorry. We're the stragglers?
- Yeah.

36:27.791 --> 36:28.874
By the time he gets to the front,

36:28.875 --> 36:30.290
the train's gonna be in the
station and we're home free.

36:30.291 --> 36:31.374
This is so fucking stupid.

36:31.375 --> 36:33.290
Man, what's stupid is
the corporatization of travel.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.040
Ensuring that the rich
move around the world,

36:35.041 --> 36:36.582
propagate their elitist loins,

36:36.583 --> 36:38.165
while the poor stay cut off from society.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.290
That's great. We can argue Marxism

36:39.291 --> 36:40.582
while they're hauling us off to Siberia.

36:40.583 --> 36:41.832
Siberia is in Russia, Dave.

36:41.833 --> 36:42.915
This is ridiculous.

36:42.916 --> 36:44.040
Tickets are probably, like, 12 bucks.

36:44.041 --> 36:45.124
It's the principle of paying.

36:45.125 --> 36:46.582
We shouldn't have to pay
for train tickets in Poland.

36:46.583 --> 36:47.749
- This is our country.
- No, it's not.

36:47.750 --> 36:49.040
It was our country. They kicked us out

36:49.041 --> 36:50.124
'cause they thought we were cheap.

36:53.458 --> 36:55.540
Okay, this is it. Stay calm. Act natural.

36:55.541 --> 36:56.708
Yeah.

36:59.666 --> 37:00.957
Hi. Just bathroom.

37:00.958 --> 37:02.249
Me and cousin go to just bathroom.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.540
- Bathrooms on either side.
- With thanks.

37:04.541 --> 37:05.790
-  Sorry.
-  Thank you.

37:05.791 --> 37:08.165
And... And we have
our tickets. We just...

37:08.166 --> 37:09.415
Oh, sh...

37:09.416 --> 37:11.290
Jesus Christ. My heart
is in my fucking throat.

37:11.291 --> 37:12.582
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

37:12.583 --> 37:13.790
We're not out of the woods yet, though.

37:13.791 --> 37:15.124
We gotta get to the front and take shelter

37:15.125 --> 37:16.207
until we get to our stop. Okay?

37:16.208 --> 37:17.332
- Okay.
- Ready?

37:17.333 --> 37:18.416
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

37:34.541 --> 37:36.290
-  Here, here.
- What? Yeah.

37:37.750 --> 37:38.915
We made it.

37:38.916 --> 37:40.290
Don't fall asleep on me again, brother.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.457
I won't.

37:46.166 --> 37:47.249
Hey, Benji.

37:47.250 --> 37:48.624
Yeah?

37:48.625 --> 37:50.000
We're in first class.

37:52.916 --> 37:54.540
Yeah, but we fucking earned it.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.957
<i>Warszawa Wschodnia odjedzie</i>

37:58.958 --> 38:01.083
<i>z peronu trzeciego.</i>

38:02.541 --> 38:04.082
All right. Should we stop
and get some lunch?

38:04.083 --> 38:05.250
- No.
- Okay.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.082
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey, everybody.

38:11.083 --> 38:12.582
Sorry we're late. Dave fell asleep.

38:12.583 --> 38:13.666
Yeah. What?

38:14.833 --> 38:16.874
- Hi, there.
- We got your bags.

38:16.875 --> 38:18.624
Oh, that's so nice
of you. I'm so sorry.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.124
Yeah, he just...
He needed to sleepy sleep.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.415
Sorry about that.
Yeah. Here's your bag.

38:21.416 --> 38:22.499
You need some help. He got sleepy.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.874
Yeah, let's drop
our bags off at the hotel.

38:23.875 --> 38:25.082
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah, yeah. All good.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.165
I'm really sorry. Oh, here.

38:26.166 --> 38:27.249
Yeah. It was actually really quick

38:27.250 --> 38:28.332
once we were able to get on the other...

38:32.541 --> 38:35.082
...and importance
of the Jewish contribution.

38:35.083 --> 38:37.540
Lublin has such a rich Jewish history.

38:37.541 --> 38:40.624
It was actually known, for
a time, as the Jewish Oxford.

38:40.625 --> 38:44.540
It was diverse, both
culturally and intellectually.

38:44.541 --> 38:47.415
This is the Lublin of Rebbe Horowitz,

38:47.416 --> 38:49.749
of the Seer of Lublin,

38:49.750 --> 38:53.916
of Isaac Bashevis Singer,
merchants, writers, poets.

38:57.541 --> 38:59.458
So, you're, like, really religious? Yeah?

39:00.125 --> 39:02.207
- Yes. Yes, you could say that.
- Huh.

39:02.208 --> 39:04.040
It's amazing to me.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.665
- Is it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:05.666 --> 39:07.665
So, you, like, do all
the customs and everything?

39:07.666 --> 39:09.999
No, no, not all. No.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.540
But I do like to keep Shabbat.

39:11.541 --> 39:12.624
Mm-hmm.

39:12.625 --> 39:14.999
No matter what's going on with my life,

39:15.000 --> 39:16.875
once a week, I get to

39:17.375 --> 39:20.415
slow down and take my rest seriously.

39:20.416 --> 39:21.583
Huh.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.415
And you?

39:23.416 --> 39:24.665
No. Me? No, no.

39:24.666 --> 39:27.040
I mean, the whole thing
always seemed like a little,

39:27.041 --> 39:29.124
I don't know, arbitrary and mechanical

39:29.125 --> 39:30.707
and archaic to me.

39:30.708 --> 39:32.625
I mean, no offense, obviously.

39:33.958 --> 39:36.249
I think it would really benefit you.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.957
You mean, like, benefit everybody

39:37.958 --> 39:39.290
or, like, me specifically?

39:39.291 --> 39:40.875
You specifically.

39:42.333 --> 39:43.333
Benji.

39:43.916 --> 39:46.333
- Yo.
- Yo!

39:47.000 --> 39:48.916
I was thinking about what you said

39:49.791 --> 39:52.124
on the train about
understanding suffering.

39:52.125 --> 39:55.207
- Mm-hmm.
- It really stirred me.

39:55.208 --> 39:57.124
Yo, seriously, Marcia?

39:57.125 --> 39:58.916
- Yeah.
- Dope.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.749
Last year, my daughter
married a very rich man.

40:02.750 --> 40:03.999
Oh, fuck.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.165
And she's incapable
of having a conversation

40:06.166 --> 40:07.249
with any depth anymore.

40:07.250 --> 40:08.332
Well, yeah, of course.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.708
Money is like fucking heroin
for boring people.

40:11.500 --> 40:12.832
Well, I don't know what that means,

40:12.833 --> 40:16.500
but it's just so easy
to float through life

40:17.125 --> 40:18.915
forgetting how lucky we are.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.790
Guys, uh, I'm eavesdropping.

40:20.791 --> 40:22.582
- Is that okay?
- 'Course, Eloge, come on in.

40:22.583 --> 40:26.290
I want to echo what Marcia was
saying, if that's all right?

40:26.291 --> 40:28.040
- Really? Really?
- Of course.

40:28.041 --> 40:30.124
I... I find myself constantly baffled

40:30.125 --> 40:31.957
by the way the world seems to carry on

40:31.958 --> 40:34.374
like there aren't a million
reasons to be shocked.

40:34.375 --> 40:36.874
- Oh. Exactly.
- To be, um... appalled.

40:36.875 --> 40:38.624
Yeah. Fuckin' A. That's
exactly what I'm saying, man.

40:38.625 --> 40:39.915
I don't know. I mean, if, like, we wept

40:39.916 --> 40:41.082
for every sad thing in the world,

40:41.083 --> 40:42.374
like, what would that accomplish?

40:42.375 --> 40:45.124
I don't know. Maybe sad shit
wouldn't constantly happen.

40:45.125 --> 40:46.207
Exactly.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.457
David, we numb ourselves

40:48.458 --> 40:50.915
to avoid thinking about our impact.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.165
Ignoring the proverbial slaughterhouse

40:53.166 --> 40:54.540
to enjoy the steak, as it were.

40:54.541 --> 40:55.999
Yes, Eloge. Damn, that's a good analogy.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.290
No. And I get that. I get all that.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.624
It just seems like maybe there's, like,

40:58.625 --> 41:00.457
a time and a place to grieve,
and maybe it's not...

41:00.458 --> 41:01.540
- Yo, Dave.
- What?

41:01.541 --> 41:03.040
We're on a fucking Holocaust tour.

41:03.041 --> 41:06.208
If now is not the time and
place to grieve, to open up,

41:06.708 --> 41:08.041
I don't know what to tell you, man.

41:10.208 --> 41:12.333
Come on, then,
you lot. Stragglers.

41:13.750 --> 41:15.208
So, here we are

41:15.625 --> 41:17.499
at the famous Grodzka Gate

41:17.500 --> 41:20.374
or, as it was once called,
the Jewish Gate.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.790
On the other side of this threshold

41:22.791 --> 41:24.790
was the Jewish Quarter, okay?

41:24.791 --> 41:26.332
Now, as we pass through,

41:26.333 --> 41:27.874
I want you to try to imagine

41:27.875 --> 41:30.040
what life was like hundreds of years ago.

41:30.041 --> 41:33.415
Try to avoid conjuring images
of the horrors to come

41:33.416 --> 41:36.166
and just picture a vibrant city.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.666
<i>The memories of Jewish life are here.</i>

41:45.958 --> 41:48.290
<i>But they're hidden around the city.</i>

41:48.291 --> 41:50.082
<i>And the oldest surviving synagogue</i>

41:50.083 --> 41:52.458
<i>is on the second floor
of an office building.</i>

41:54.250 --> 41:57.125
<i>But there are little pieces
of history frozen.</i>

41:57.791 --> 41:59.875
<i>Peeking out, waiting for us.</i>

42:01.375 --> 42:03.166
<i>A former Yiddish theater.</i>

42:05.041 --> 42:06.208
<i>A yeshiva.</i>

42:07.791 --> 42:09.541
<i>A Jewish-owned brewery.</i>

42:10.958 --> 42:12.750
<i>The Tarbut Hebrew School.</i>

42:13.791 --> 42:16.166
<i>The Community Council of Lublin.</i>

42:17.833 --> 42:18.875
<i>A tailor.</i>

42:19.833 --> 42:21.291
<i>A dry goods store.</i>

42:22.375 --> 42:23.583
<i>A bakery.</i>

42:24.625 --> 42:25.833
<i>A bookseller.</i>

42:27.125 --> 42:28.541
<i>A textile shop.</i>

42:45.041 --> 42:46.290
So, there's some discrepancy

42:46.291 --> 42:47.749
about the founding of the cemetery,

42:47.750 --> 42:50.249
but most people have it pegged at 1541.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.624
-  Oh, wow. No.
-  Can you imagine?

42:51.625 --> 42:53.291
That's before the founding
of the United States.

42:53.875 --> 42:55.832
That's before, I don't know, Shakespeare.

42:55.833 --> 42:58.499
And the oldest headstone
in the whole of Poland

42:58.500 --> 43:00.374
is actually located right here

43:00.375 --> 43:01.915
- in the cemetery.
- Oh, yes. Kopelman.

43:01.916 --> 43:03.582
Yes, Eloge. How'd you know that?

43:03.583 --> 43:05.999
I read about it this morning.
Don't be too impressed.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.124
What?

43:07.125 --> 43:08.332
Ding, ding. Right again, Eloge.

43:08.333 --> 43:09.415
What's your problem now?

43:09.416 --> 43:10.582
Jacob Kopelman Levi. 1541.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.665
- Who cares?
-  It's quite

43:11.666 --> 43:13.040
unassuming, isn't it, if you don't know

43:13.041 --> 43:14.249
- what you're looking at?
-  Benji, what the fuck?

43:14.250 --> 43:16.040
-  It's just...
-  It's hard to know

43:16.041 --> 43:17.832
whether the Jewish community
was drawn to Lublin

43:17.833 --> 43:18.915
because of these local virtues...

43:18.916 --> 43:19.999
Benji? Benji?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.749
- Um, yo, James?
- Oh, shit. Benji?

43:21.750 --> 43:23.249
- Hey, James. Hey, man.
- Benji, Benji, Benji.

43:23.250 --> 43:24.749
-  You all right, Benji?
- Hey, look, man,

43:24.750 --> 43:27.499
you're, like, completely
knowledgeable about this shit.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.999
And it's fuckin'... It's...
It's impressive, man.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.790
And we all know that now
and everything. But, like...

43:32.791 --> 43:34.749
Like, these are real people,
James, you know?

43:34.750 --> 43:36.957
They're not your little
factoids lying under here,

43:36.958 --> 43:38.249
okay? They're not history lessons.

43:38.250 --> 43:39.332
-  Benji, Benji, okay.
- Just... Hey,

43:39.333 --> 43:40.415
maybe, like, take a seat.

43:40.416 --> 43:41.582
Text your wife. Have a sit for a second.

43:41.583 --> 43:42.832
Sorry if I said
something to upset you or...

43:42.833 --> 43:43.915
No. No, no, no. Look, look.

43:43.916 --> 43:45.082
You know your shit. Don't get me wrong.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.790
And, Eloge, you, like,
totally know your shit,

43:46.791 --> 43:49.082
but I think it's just
the constant barrage of stats.

43:49.083 --> 43:50.833
It's making this whole thing feel very

43:51.583 --> 43:52.583
cold, you know?

43:55.583 --> 43:57.290
Okay. Er...

43:57.291 --> 44:00.999
I'm sorry. M-Maybe it's just
my British tone or something.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.540
- I'm just trying to be honest.
- Okay.

44:02.541 --> 44:04.082
If it helps to have feedback,
that's what I'm doing.

44:04.083 --> 44:05.165
-  Okay.
- And I just think

44:05.166 --> 44:07.124
a major problem with your tour...

44:07.125 --> 44:08.415
-  Oh, my God.
-  If I can just...

44:08.416 --> 44:10.165
This is okay? This is a free space?

44:10.166 --> 44:11.499
Okay.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.290
I just think we've been,
like, completely cut off

44:13.291 --> 44:15.374
from anything that's, like,
fucking...

44:15.375 --> 44:16.708
like, real, you know?

44:17.500 --> 44:18.874
It's all real, Benji.

44:18.875 --> 44:20.540
- Is it?
- I've only said real things.

44:20.541 --> 44:21.915
It's real? Then how come
I haven't met anyone

44:21.916 --> 44:23.457
- that's actually Polish?
- I've only said real things.

44:23.458 --> 44:24.624
I haven't had any interaction

44:24.625 --> 44:25.957
with somebody who's, like, from here.

44:25.958 --> 44:27.082
- You know what I mean?
- Benji, come on.

44:27.083 --> 44:28.499
We've just been going
from one touristy thing

44:28.500 --> 44:29.624
to another touristy thing to...

44:29.625 --> 44:31.540
-  you know?
- Yeah, no, but that sort of

44:31.541 --> 44:32.832
is what a tour is, though, isn't it?

44:32.833 --> 44:34.249
Going from one touristy thing to another.

44:34.250 --> 44:36.249
That's kind of what
you signed up for, isn't it?

44:36.250 --> 44:37.833
Well, Dave signed up for the tour.

44:39.166 --> 44:40.874
All right. Yeah, no. I mean, I'm sorry.

44:40.875 --> 44:43.665
- Mm-hmm.
- Look, man. And you know what?

44:43.666 --> 44:46.415
Honestly, it's like a mostly amazing tour.

44:46.416 --> 44:47.499
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean it, man.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.790
Like, I'm fuckin'... I'm lovin' it.

44:48.791 --> 44:49.999
It's totally Dave's speed.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.249
But just, like, chill

44:52.250 --> 44:53.999
on the facts and figures
for just a little bit.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.583
I mean, would that be cool?

44:57.333 --> 44:58.499
No. Yeah, 'course. Yeah.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.457
- Let's tone it down.
- Great.

45:00.458 --> 45:02.708
Cool, that's all. That's all I'm asking.

45:03.916 --> 45:05.165
Erm...

45:05.166 --> 45:08.125
Well, what I was gonna suggest
was we could put a rock on...

45:09.750 --> 45:12.875
er, Kopelman's headstone.

45:13.666 --> 45:14.749
- Yeah.
-  Yeah?

45:14.750 --> 45:16.040
- Fuckin' love that idea.
- No, I think

45:16.041 --> 45:17.790
- that's a good idea.
- Thanks, man.

45:17.791 --> 45:18.874
So can I call them over?

45:18.875 --> 45:20.082
Do whatever you want, man.
It's your tour, James.

45:20.083 --> 45:21.915
Okay, if everybody could just
come over here for a moment?

45:21.916 --> 45:23.750
- Everybody? Marcia?
- Everyone look for stones.

45:24.791 --> 45:26.499
- Here we go. Look, here's one.
-  Yeah.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.000
- Yeah, no problem.
-  Erm...

45:28.791 --> 45:31.332
- If I can just very quickly...
- Yeah.

45:31.333 --> 45:35.457
This is the oldest tombstone
in all of Poland.

45:35.458 --> 45:39.665
Erm, and it belongs to a man
called Jacob Kopelman Levi,

45:39.666 --> 45:43.166
who was a real human person who lived,

45:43.750 --> 45:46.375
er, in the real world. He was Polish.

45:47.958 --> 45:49.540
Er, from Poland.

45:49.541 --> 45:51.624
And Benji and I were just discussing

45:51.625 --> 45:53.040
what might be nice to do,

45:53.041 --> 45:56.665
and we thought maybe we could
all put a stone on his grave.

45:56.666 --> 46:00.165
Erm, various theories
about this Jewish tradition.

46:00.166 --> 46:03.208
But personally, I like to think it's just

46:03.666 --> 46:07.208
a simple warm gesture to say, er,

46:08.250 --> 46:09.541
"You're not forgotten."

46:12.625 --> 46:14.291
That was beautiful, James. Thank you.

46:14.666 --> 46:18.749
Okay. Erm, so, let's do that,
shall we? Everyone?

46:18.750 --> 46:19.832
Should we try and find some nice stones?

46:19.833 --> 46:21.082
-  Yeah. Yes.
-  Yeah, that was great.

46:21.083 --> 46:22.165
-  Good idea.
- Yeah.

46:22.166 --> 46:23.249
I'll go look for a stone.

46:23.250 --> 46:24.624
-  Great, great.
- I think that was

46:24.625 --> 46:26.790
- a very lovely idea, Benji.
-  Oh, thanks, Marcia.

46:26.791 --> 46:28.207
- Thank you.
-  Yeah. It was nice.

46:28.208 --> 46:29.915
Yeah, we sorta cooked it up.

46:29.916 --> 46:31.624
-  Let's find it.
-  Stone hunt.

46:31.625 --> 46:33.750
I'm gonna have the biggest stones.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.708
I want, like, a nice
flat one, that's like...

46:37.083 --> 46:38.207
-  Sorry.
-  Ooh, here we go.

46:38.208 --> 46:39.582
-  It's fine.
-  Hey, Marcia.

46:39.583 --> 46:40.999
Yeah.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.040
Okay. We all good with our stones?

46:43.041 --> 46:44.666
I'd like this one, please.

47:19.708 --> 47:21.540
My dad was everyone's favorite,

47:21.541 --> 47:24.124
but my dad's brother was the real brains

47:24.125 --> 47:25.207
- of the family.
-  Yeah.

47:25.208 --> 47:26.665
He got rejected
from medical school

47:26.666 --> 47:28.332
because of quotas, you know,

47:28.333 --> 47:29.832
- with Jewish doctors.
-  Oh, right.

47:29.833 --> 47:31.082
And he... I'm sorry.

47:31.083 --> 47:32.165
I'm just having a little trouble

47:32.166 --> 47:34.165
competing with <i>Hava Nagila.</i>

47:34.166 --> 47:35.249
I'm so sorry. Yeah.

47:35.250 --> 47:36.790
- Yeah.
- We come here every tour

47:36.791 --> 47:38.165
and the food is wonderful,

47:38.166 --> 47:40.457
but the music can be
a little bit kitschy, so...

47:40.458 --> 47:41.750
Anti-Semitic pricks.

47:42.416 --> 47:43.707
Well, I don't know about anti-Semitic,

47:43.708 --> 47:45.374
like, the owners are Jewish, but...

47:45.375 --> 47:48.125
Ugh. Sorry. Please continue, Marcia.

47:48.666 --> 47:51.957
Um, so my Uncle Sam
couldn't go to medical school,

47:51.958 --> 47:53.790
so he became a pharmacist,

47:53.791 --> 47:56.957
and he ended up owning five... Five, yeah.

47:56.958 --> 47:58.874
Five pharmacies in
and around the Chicago area.

47:58.875 --> 47:59.957
- Wow.
-  Like, he started

47:59.958 --> 48:01.999
what we now think of as, like,
a modern-day drug store.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.082
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah. Exactly.

48:03.083 --> 48:04.415
- That's extraordinary.
- You know what I mean?

48:04.416 --> 48:05.582
Yeah, yeah. And now the song's over.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.749
Just as I'm done with
my story, which is my usual...

48:07.750 --> 48:09.499
That just speaks of the whole
immigrant experience,

48:09.500 --> 48:10.749
- don't you think?
-  Exactly.

48:10.750 --> 48:12.749
I can attest to that, absolutely.

48:12.750 --> 48:15.499
Mark's great uncle
came off the boat from Poland,

48:15.500 --> 48:18.250
landed in Galveston for some
<i>fakakta</i> reason.

48:18.791 --> 48:19.790
Jew in Texas.

48:19.791 --> 48:21.374
And he made money by taking the furniture

48:21.375 --> 48:23.082
the rich people threw out on the street,

48:23.083 --> 48:25.082
refurbishing it and reselling.

48:25.083 --> 48:26.749
-  Really?
- True story. Mm-hmm.

48:26.750 --> 48:28.707
Apparently, he ended up selling some of it

48:28.708 --> 48:30.457
back to the original owners.

48:30.458 --> 48:31.707
- No, he did not. Is that true?
-  Yes.

48:31.708 --> 48:32.874
- Of course, he did.
- Great uncle.

48:32.875 --> 48:33.957
Brilliant. Yeah, that is brilliant.

48:33.958 --> 48:35.749
Rich people are fucking idiots.

48:37.375 --> 48:39.540
Uh, well, anyway, our grandmother.

48:39.541 --> 48:41.458
- Um, she was...
- Grandma Dory.

48:42.208 --> 48:44.082
Yeah. Our Grandmother Dory,

48:44.083 --> 48:45.832
whose house we're seeing on Thursday,

48:45.833 --> 48:48.415
was also just this,
you know, amazing woman.

48:48.416 --> 48:50.125
She was just like one of these, like,

48:50.541 --> 48:53.165
bygone realist types
that you don't see anymore.

48:53.166 --> 48:55.582
You know, just like blunt and tough and...

48:55.583 --> 48:56.957
Um, I mean, to be honest,

48:56.958 --> 48:59.124
I was, like, scared shitless
my whole childhood of her.

48:59.125 --> 49:00.374
I was never scared of her.

49:00.375 --> 49:01.582
That is true. That is true.

49:01.583 --> 49:03.915
No. She and Benji had some,
like, special secret language.

49:03.916 --> 49:05.374
They always said exactly
what was on their minds.

49:05.375 --> 49:06.457
Didn't you?

49:06.458 --> 49:07.749
- Had no choice.
-  Yeah.

49:07.750 --> 49:09.749
And a similar story,
she survived the camps

49:09.750 --> 49:11.790
through, like, a thousand miracles,

49:11.791 --> 49:12.874
and she made her way to New York,

49:12.875 --> 49:14.415
and she wanted to design dresses.

49:14.416 --> 49:15.832
But she couldn't afford fashion school,

49:15.833 --> 49:17.999
so she got stuck working as a secretary.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.415
Yeah. And then she was like, "Fuck this."

49:19.416 --> 49:21.290
And she ended up
taking over the whole company.

49:21.291 --> 49:22.749
- Wow.
-  Baller.

49:22.750 --> 49:24.290
Well, he's making it sound like

49:24.291 --> 49:25.874
she led a junta or something. No.

49:25.875 --> 49:27.540
No, she was just...
No, she was super smart.

49:27.541 --> 49:29.332
It was a small commercial
real estate company.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.415
It was not, you know...

49:30.416 --> 49:31.624
I used to speak to her every Thursday.

49:31.625 --> 49:32.707
-  Aw.
- Yeah.

49:32.708 --> 49:34.582
- Literally every Thursday.
- That is so nice, Benji.

49:34.583 --> 49:38.040
If I hear from my kids
once a month, it's a shock.

49:38.041 --> 49:39.790
Oh, Marcia. Fuck those guys.

49:39.791 --> 49:42.249
- Man, I wouldn't miss a week.
- Mm-hmm.

49:42.250 --> 49:43.500
She was tough on me.

49:43.958 --> 49:45.915
She was the only one
in the whole fuckin' family

49:45.916 --> 49:47.665
that would keep me honest.

49:47.666 --> 49:49.290
You know, everyone else just disappeared

49:49.291 --> 49:50.916
when I needed them most.

49:52.541 --> 49:55.750
Yeah. But, um, you know,
Grandma never pitied herself.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.249
In fact, she always told me

49:57.250 --> 49:58.832
she was grateful for her struggle.

49:58.833 --> 50:01.332
Well, that's just it. What she endured,

50:01.333 --> 50:02.499
that gave her hope, right?

50:02.500 --> 50:04.415
Yes. In fact, she used
to tell me that, like,

50:04.416 --> 50:06.457
you know, uh, first-generation immigrants

50:06.458 --> 50:07.707
work some, like, menial job.

50:07.708 --> 50:09.957
You know, they drive cabs,
they deliver food.

50:09.958 --> 50:11.707
Second generation, they go to good schools

50:11.708 --> 50:12.790
and they become, like, you know,

50:12.791 --> 50:14.040
a doctor or lawyer or whatever.

50:14.041 --> 50:15.874
And the third generation

50:15.875 --> 50:17.165
lives in their mother's basement

50:17.166 --> 50:19.040
and smokes pot all day.

50:19.041 --> 50:20.250
I mean...

50:21.625 --> 50:22.791
She said that?

50:25.625 --> 50:27.332
I think she was, like,
just speaking generally

50:27.333 --> 50:28.582
about, like, the immigrant experience.

50:28.583 --> 50:29.874
Because I lived in my mom's basement.

50:29.875 --> 50:31.165
She was just talking about immigrants.

50:31.166 --> 50:32.250
- Okay. Yeah.
- That's all.

50:40.666 --> 50:42.124
I gotsta pee.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.499
Oh, yeah.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.958
When I go to the bathroom,
I'll get that. Don't worry.

50:50.583 --> 50:52.458
Pee-pee time.

50:56.333 --> 50:58.500
I'm sorry about him.

50:59.208 --> 51:00.208
No, no.

51:00.791 --> 51:02.207
What a troubled young man.

51:02.208 --> 51:04.165
He wants to be good.
You can see the spark.

51:04.166 --> 51:05.707
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Absolutely, Eloge.

51:05.708 --> 51:07.832
Forgive me if I don't see
this magical spark.

51:07.833 --> 51:10.165
Mark, stop it. He's tormented
for whatever reason.

51:10.166 --> 51:11.332
- Okay. Okay.
-  He's funny

51:11.333 --> 51:13.874
and he's charming under all the <i>mishegoss.</i>

51:13.875 --> 51:15.165
I feel bad for him.

51:15.166 --> 51:17.165
- Has he always been like this?
- Yeah.

51:17.166 --> 51:18.874
I mean, he's always been,
like, up and down, you know?

51:18.875 --> 51:20.207
Like, he's sensitive and he, like,

51:20.208 --> 51:21.915
sees people so clearly, you know?

51:21.916 --> 51:22.999
But then you say the wrong thing

51:23.000 --> 51:24.666
and, like, something switches.

51:25.083 --> 51:26.582
Maybe it's not appropriate
to talk about him.

51:26.583 --> 51:28.040
No. What's not appropriate?

51:28.041 --> 51:31.333
You obviously got something
going on between you and...

51:32.166 --> 51:33.832
Well, he's clearly in pain.

51:33.833 --> 51:35.874
Yeah, but isn't everyone
in pain in some way?

51:35.875 --> 51:38.457
I mean, look at what happened
to our families.

51:38.458 --> 51:39.874
Look at where we came from.

51:39.875 --> 51:41.957
I mean, who isn't...
You know, who isn't wrought?

51:41.958 --> 51:43.290
Well, you seem okay.

51:43.291 --> 51:44.457
I'm not, though. I'm not.

51:44.458 --> 51:47.082
I just, like, take a pill
for my fucking OCD, you know,

51:47.083 --> 51:48.832
and I jog and I meditate,

51:48.833 --> 51:50.582
and I go to work in the morning.

51:50.583 --> 51:52.165
I, like, come home at the end of the day,

51:52.166 --> 51:53.415
and I, like, move forward, you know,

51:53.416 --> 51:55.040
because I know
that my pain is unexceptional,

51:55.041 --> 51:56.665
so I don't feel the need to, like,

51:56.666 --> 51:58.707
I don't know, burden everybody
with it, you know?

51:58.708 --> 52:00.374
-  Yeah.
-  Mm-hmm.

52:00.375 --> 52:01.874
Yeah. God, I'm sorry.

52:01.875 --> 52:03.124
No. It's all right, David.

52:03.125 --> 52:04.332
-  It's okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm ranting.

52:04.333 --> 52:05.666
I'm just, like...

52:07.041 --> 52:09.291
I don't know. Um...

52:10.458 --> 52:11.582
Ooh.

52:11.583 --> 52:13.415
Sorry. I'm just, like,
so fucking exhausted

52:13.416 --> 52:15.124
by him sometimes, you know,

52:15.125 --> 52:17.082
like, I...

52:17.083 --> 52:18.915
I... I love him

52:18.916 --> 52:20.415
and I hate him

52:20.416 --> 52:23.000
and I want to kill him.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.665
And I want to be him, you know?

52:26.666 --> 52:28.166
And I feel, like,

52:28.541 --> 52:30.707
so stupid around him, you know,

52:30.708 --> 52:31.915
because he is so fucking cool,

52:31.916 --> 52:33.415
and he just does not give a shit.

52:33.416 --> 52:34.500
And then...

52:35.375 --> 52:36.915
just, like, being here with him

52:36.916 --> 52:39.374
is just so fucking baffling
to me, you know?

52:39.375 --> 52:41.499
It's just baffling 'cause it's, like,

52:41.500 --> 52:44.082
how did this guy come from the survivors

52:44.083 --> 52:46.374
of this place, you know?

52:46.375 --> 52:48.082
I mean that your uncle had to sell, like,

52:48.083 --> 52:49.832
used furniture to rich assholes

52:49.833 --> 52:51.415
or, like, couldn't get
into medical school.

52:51.416 --> 52:53.040
And that you survived, like,

52:53.041 --> 52:54.874
the worst thing to happen on this planet

52:54.875 --> 52:56.290
in the last 30 years.

52:56.291 --> 52:59.707
And that our grandma survived
by a thousand miracles

52:59.708 --> 53:02.415
when the entire world was
trying to kill her, you know?

53:02.416 --> 53:04.833
And I look at him

53:05.375 --> 53:07.916
and I just, like, wanna ask him...

53:08.541 --> 53:11.957
I just wanna ask him, and I just can't.

53:11.958 --> 53:13.582
Like...

53:13.583 --> 53:17.499
Like, how did the product
of a thousand fucking miracles

53:17.500 --> 53:20.500
overdose on a bottle of sleeping pills?

53:22.541 --> 53:23.541
What?

53:23.958 --> 53:25.499
What did you say?

53:25.500 --> 53:26.875
Yeah, he tried to...

53:28.375 --> 53:30.666
Yeah. Sorry. I probably
shouldn't have said anything.

53:32.541 --> 53:35.832
It's okay. Er, I'm sorry to hear that.

53:35.833 --> 53:38.290
I'm so sorry. That's...
That's very distressing.

53:38.291 --> 53:39.457
When did this happen?

53:39.458 --> 53:41.625
Like, six... six months ago.

53:42.458 --> 53:45.250
My Aunt Leah, Benji's mom,
found him on the couch.

53:47.333 --> 53:50.665
And I know he is so funny and so charming.

53:50.666 --> 53:52.124
And you are all gonna walk away

53:52.125 --> 53:54.957
with this picture of this amazing man,

53:54.958 --> 53:57.250
which he totally is in so many ways.

53:57.916 --> 53:59.875
But when I picture him,

54:00.875 --> 54:04.249
it is passed out on a ratty basement couch

54:04.250 --> 54:05.582
while I am in New York City

54:05.583 --> 54:07.665
with my beautiful wife and adorable child,

54:07.666 --> 54:09.625
and it just fucking kills me.

54:12.041 --> 54:15.708
Sorry.
I'm... I'm oversharing.

54:23.875 --> 54:25.291
Well, they're back again.

54:26.666 --> 54:27.790
It's him.

54:38.666 --> 54:40.416
Did you know he plays the piano?

54:41.333 --> 54:43.166
We used to take lessons together.

54:47.458 --> 54:48.541
Excuse me.

55:23.916 --> 55:25.332
<i>Aw, that's so nice, Benji.</i>

55:25.333 --> 55:27.040
<i>That was wonderful, Benji.</i>

56:22.500 --> 56:23.625
Fuck.

56:32.625 --> 56:34.915
Hi. Um, sorry to bother you.

56:34.916 --> 56:36.249
Did you happen to see, like,

56:36.250 --> 56:38.790
my cousin come through or anything?

56:38.791 --> 56:39.915
He's, like, um...

56:44.583 --> 56:46.040
<i>Have been
forwarded to an automated</i>

56:46.041 --> 56:47.499
<i>voice messaging system.</i>

56:47.500 --> 56:48.582
<i>Boner.</i>

56:48.583 --> 56:50.124
<i>Is not available.</i>

56:50.125 --> 56:51.249
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

56:51.250 --> 56:53.290
<i>and cannot accept
any messages at this time.</i>

56:53.291 --> 56:54.375
<i>Goodbye.</i>

57:04.958 --> 57:05.957
Hello?

57:05.958 --> 57:07.040
<i>Dude, where the fuck are ya?</i>

57:07.041 --> 57:08.332
<i>We're all downstairs waiting for you, man.</i>

57:08.333 --> 57:09.415
Oh, shit.

57:09.416 --> 57:10.874
<i>- Get your ass down here.</i>
- Fuck.

57:23.375 --> 57:25.832
Ah, there he is. Mornin', Dave.

57:25.833 --> 57:27.540
You sleep through your alarm or somethin'?

57:27.541 --> 57:29.749
No. My phone died
because I didn't plug it in

57:29.750 --> 57:31.124
because I spent the night looking for you.

57:31.125 --> 57:32.207
Where the fuck were you?

57:32.208 --> 57:35.290
Oh. Sorry, dude. Yeah.
You were fast asleep.

57:35.291 --> 57:37.249
Yeah? Well, you scared
the shit out of me, Benji.

57:37.250 --> 57:38.957
Oh. Sorry, man.

57:38.958 --> 57:40.249
Yeah, I was just kicking it with Marcia.

57:40.250 --> 57:41.832
- Didn't wanna wake you.
-  Good morning, gang.

57:41.833 --> 57:43.082
<i>- Dzien Dobry.</i>
-  Mornin'.

57:43.083 --> 57:44.165
You're all down so early. I love that.

57:44.166 --> 57:45.416
- Morning.
- Good morning.

57:46.166 --> 57:47.582
Well, the van should be here.

57:47.583 --> 57:50.958
It's gonna be an eerily short drive. Okay?

57:59.708 --> 58:01.457
Whatever.

58:01.458 --> 58:04.000
Yeah. I think I was feeling okay until...

58:05.625 --> 58:06.790
I don't like...

58:06.791 --> 58:09.207
Okay. So, if I could just
get everyone's attention

58:09.208 --> 58:11.290
- just for a moment.
- James.

58:11.291 --> 58:12.374
Erm, I don't wanna state the obvious,

58:12.375 --> 58:14.250
but today is gonna be quite a taxing day.

58:14.791 --> 58:17.499
If you've never been to
a concentration camp before,

58:17.500 --> 58:19.583
it can be pretty overwhelming.

58:20.333 --> 58:22.165
We'll be there in, like,
literally two minutes.

58:22.166 --> 58:24.291
Okay? Thanks, everyone.

58:46.375 --> 58:47.500
Everyone all right?

58:49.208 --> 58:51.124
So, the first thing you might notice

58:51.125 --> 58:53.624
is that Majdanek
is literally just two miles

58:53.625 --> 58:55.166
from Lublin town square.

58:56.666 --> 58:58.958
Can you imagine life continuing on,

58:59.708 --> 59:01.207
a bustling town center

59:01.208 --> 59:03.250
just two miles from these grounds?

59:08.000 --> 59:10.332
Before the Red Army got to Majdanek,

59:10.333 --> 59:12.374
the Nazis had actually moved
most of their prisoners

59:12.375 --> 59:14.457
to other camps out west.

59:14.458 --> 59:17.207
And, in their haste, the SS
didn't destroy the evidence.

59:17.208 --> 59:18.999
So, unlike other camps,

59:19.000 --> 59:21.291
Majdanek is actually quite, erm,

59:22.041 --> 59:24.958
well-preserved,
for lack of a better phrase.

59:37.833 --> 59:39.332
So, before we head in,

59:39.333 --> 59:40.832
I might be a little bit sparser

59:40.833 --> 59:43.041
with my information overload today.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.707
This is a sacred site

59:44.708 --> 59:47.332
where many thousands were murdered,

59:47.333 --> 59:49.249
and I think you'll find this place

59:49.250 --> 59:50.500
kinda speaks for itself.

59:51.333 --> 59:52.333
Okay?

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:02.666
Hey.

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:04.875
Hey.

01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:10.750
These are the barracks.

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:22.833
This is the men's bathhouse.

01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:35.165
"He grabbed his whip

01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.208
"and herded us towards the bathhouse.

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:40.457
"There, once our hair was cut and shaved

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:41.875
"from our entire bodies,

01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:44.000
"we went into the next room."

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:07.833
This is the gas chamber.

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:31.040
The blue stains on the walls are residue

01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:33.916
from the deadly gas, Zyklon B.

01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:44.041
The ovens.

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:10.708
Just hang here for a moment. Yeah?

01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:14.833
Okay. [exhales] Oh.

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:19.500
So, if we just gather here
for just a moment.

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:21.416
How are we all feeling?

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:24.166
Mm... Not feeling so good.

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:26.499
Numb, maybe?

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.915
Yeah. That's about right.

01:03:27.916 --> 01:03:29.082
Eloge, how are you doing?

01:03:29.083 --> 01:03:30.665
I know you don't have
the same advantage of

01:03:30.666 --> 01:03:32.624
distance, so to speak.

01:03:32.625 --> 01:03:36.290
Uh, I'm okay. I feel, um...

01:03:36.291 --> 01:03:37.582
shaken.

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:40.832
But, uh, I guess that's better
than feeling nothing.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:41.916
Yeah.

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.457
Well, thank you all for sharing that

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:46.249
with me and with each other.

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:47.832
Don't wanna rush anyone, but obviously

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:49.749
we're leaving for Zamość quite soon.

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:51.125
So just to change gears,

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.040
we're losing the lads.

01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:54.457
-  Aw.
-  Very sad. Yep.

01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:56.832
The boys are staying here
for another night, and then

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.457
finishing their pilgrimage
to see Grandma Dory's house.

01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:01.915
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I'm...

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:03.082
I'm gonna miss all you guys.

01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:05.165
Like a weird, fucked-up family.

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:08.749
- Can I just, uh...
- Yeah.

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.332
-  Thanks, David.
- You are amazing.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:11.499
Thanks so much.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.290
Send me a photograph
of your grandma's house.

01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:14.582
- I wanna see it, okay?
- Yeah. I'll do that.

01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:15.665
-  Okay.
- Thank you.

01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:16.749
Have fun at Grandma's.

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:18.540
- Take care of yourself, honey.
- You too.

01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:20.332
And take care of him 'cause he won't.

01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:21.790
-  Okay.
- No, no, no, that's fine.

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:23.457
- Take care of this guy.
-  Right.

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:24.540
You're a good guy, Benji.

01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:26.124
No. You are.

01:04:26.125 --> 01:04:28.082
- Do you mean that? Really?
- Yes, I do. <i>Lech leh-shalom.</i>

01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:29.582
-  Thanks. Travel safe.
- Go in peace, my friend.

01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:31.124
Oh, fuckin' A. That means a lot to me.

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.708
I'm gonna look up what that means.

01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:35.040
Take care. So good to do this.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.291
So, Benji, erm, I just want to say,

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.999
I've been doing this
for five and a half years.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.124
And I always say,

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:42.999
"Please, just let me know
if I can do anything better."

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.707
And you're the first person
ever to give me

01:04:45.708 --> 01:04:47.082
actionable feedback, so...

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.165
thank you so much for that, yeah.

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:49.250
Get the fuck outta here. What did I say?

01:04:50.166 --> 01:04:51.165
What are you talking about?

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:52.957
You know, the stuff about engaging with

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.665
Polish people
and the Polish culture and...

01:04:55.666 --> 01:04:56.749
Oh, man, that sounds great.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:57.832
You should fucking do that, man.

01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:59.749
I know. And I resisted it on the day,

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.499
but I can't stop thinking about it.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.874
And you've really reawakened
something in me, so...

01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:07.457
- Get the fuck outta here, man.
- You're a very honest man,

01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:08.540
and that's rare.

01:05:08.541 --> 01:05:09.832
- And I appreciate it, so...
- Yeah. Oh, shut up.

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:12.333
- Come on. Like...
- Thanks so much. Thank you.

01:05:12.666 --> 01:05:13.749
Okay.

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.999
Sorry. I just wanted
to get that off my chest.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.083
Thanks, David.

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:22.749
He's a nice guy.

01:05:38.541 --> 01:05:39.665
- Did you?
- Yeah. Well, no.

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:41.165
I mean, that's absurd.

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:43.540
- Yeah. Yeah. What? What?
- Does this look good?

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:44.624
What? Yeah. All right, let's go.

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.082
- How much is this?
<i>- Trzydzieści złotych.</i>

01:05:46.083 --> 01:05:47.165
You don't need to get the hat.

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:48.249
Do you want one too?

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.624
No. You look like the Ricola man.

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:51.832
Do you want that? Uh, no, that's for you.

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.165
You get to keep it.

01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:54.249
- Okay. Benji.
- Yeah. I wouldn't know

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.332
what to do with it.

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:57.582
Can we get something to eat
that's, like, not pickled?

01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:59.749
-  Pierogies?
- Anything that's not pierogies

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:01.290
- and not pickled.
-  Sauerkraut?

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.540
Sauerkraut is...
it's pickled and German.

01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:05.999
...to go and grab kids' heads
in the audience and lick it.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.999
- God, that's so gross.
- Yeah! The Bushwhacker!

01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:11.500
Yes. I remember that. Yeah.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Hey, doggie.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:17.832
- Yo, can I have a swig?
-  Oh, yeah.

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:20.375
Have as much as you want.
We got the cheap shit.

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:23.915
All right. Check out this building.

01:06:23.916 --> 01:06:24.999
Yeah.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.416
Pretty tall. I got one last joint.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.541
How are we gonna get up?

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:32.375
Shall we?

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:38.375
<i>- Cześć.
- Cześć.</i>

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:41.375
Blork.

01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:52.332
<i>Jutro będzie padać.</i>

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:53.666
Mm. Mm-hmm.

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:05.041
- All right.
- Yeah. Not bad. Not bad.

01:07:06.916 --> 01:07:08.040
Shit.
You know what I think that is?

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:09.790
-  Hmm. What?
- Look way down there.

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:10.957
You see those, like, three lights?

01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:12.040
-  What?
- One, two, three.

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:13.457
-  Oh, shit.
- I think it's the camp.

01:07:13.458 --> 01:07:14.999
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.333
Really is so close.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.082
Yeah, so, what are you thinkin' of doing

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.583
when you get back to Binghamton?

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.415
What do you mean?

01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:28.083
I mean, like, what's...
Like, what's your plan?

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:30.749
Dude, give me that

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:31.999
if you're just gonna fucking stare at it.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.165
- Oh, sorry.
- It's my last one.

01:07:33.166 --> 01:07:34.332
- Sorry, man.
- All right.

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:35.416
Sorry about that.

01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:38.040
Yeah, well, when I get back,
it's gonna be pretty busy.

01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:39.124
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:40.207
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

01:07:40.208 --> 01:07:42.040
My buddy, Tim, is re-roofing his house,

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:43.582
and I'm probably gonna
help him out with that.

01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:45.124
He's got a shit ton of adobe.

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:46.707
Has no idea what the fuck he's doing.

01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:48.583
-  Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.332
- Gonna be good, though.
- Yeah.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.125
Be pretty sweet
when he's finished. You know?

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:54.790
Keeps moisture out better

01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:56.540
than that plastic toxic shit they use

01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:58.207
on all those bullshit
suburban houses, you know?

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.290
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.

01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:01.000
Yeah. It's gonna be pretty rad.

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:05.333
Well, that's, like, Tim's house.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:07.708
- So?
- So...

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:09.666
what are you gonna do?

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:11.457
Oh, man. Why the fuck you asking me that?

01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:12.540
I wanna make sure you're good

01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.250
and that you have, like, a plan.

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:16.332
Sorry. Maybe I'm a little stoned.

01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:17.415
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. No. Mm-mm.

01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:18.624
- Here, take this.
- No. It's all right.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.666
- I can't be trusted.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:08:22.708 --> 01:08:24.750
And, like, what are you gonna
do when you go home?

01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:28.082
I don't know. Go back to, like,

01:08:28.083 --> 01:08:30.249
my job and my family, the usual.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.500
Great. I look forward to
speaking to you in six months.

01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:34.790
What does that mean?

01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:35.957
- You know what it means, man.
- Do I?

01:08:35.958 --> 01:08:37.249
I don't really wanna start anything.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.625
Okay, good. Then don't.

01:08:41.666 --> 01:08:42.707
You used to be fucking different, man.

01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:44.332
You used to be so emotional.

01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:46.499
You used to fucking cry
about everything, man. Like...

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.874
Yeah, I know. It was awful.

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:49.500
Who the fuck wants
to cry about everything?

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:51.374
Dave, man, you're not fucking
listenin' to me, man.

01:08:51.375 --> 01:08:53.124
I'm saying that we used to be different.

01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:54.499
- Like, "we."
- Yeah. Benji, I have, like,

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.499
- a job and a family.
- Mm. I know.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.749
And I don't have time to
hang out with you all night,

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.374
- every night, okay?
- I don't fucking want that.

01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:02.457
Yes, you do. You're, like,
an all-encompassing person.

01:09:02.458 --> 01:09:03.540
I don't think you realize that.

01:09:03.541 --> 01:09:04.624
Man, I'm just saying, like, you, like...

01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:05.707
I don't think you realize that.

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:06.957
Man, you, like, literally never visit me.

01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:08.749
What, in... Sorry, you mean in Binghamton?

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:09.874
Yeah, man, that's where I live.

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:11.999
Well, yeah, I'm busy, okay?
And I live in New York City.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.499
Isn't it easier
for you to come down to me?

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.499
Easier? It's the same
fucking distance, Dave.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.624
Yeah, but it's New York City, man.

01:09:16.625 --> 01:09:17.999
It's, like, the more logical
place to visit

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.082
than fucking Binghamton,

01:09:19.083 --> 01:09:20.415
- all due respect.
- What's wrong with Binghamton?

01:09:20.416 --> 01:09:21.499
Nothing is wrong with Binghamton.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.165
You are, like, purposefully
making me look like an asshole

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:24.499
- for questioning it.
- Mm. Yo, fuck off, dude.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.583
Yo, you fuck off.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.957
Why don't you give a shit
about me anymore?

01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:29.958
I do give a shit about you.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.000
I just don't understand

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:33.999
how you would ever do

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.666
anything so fucking stupid to yourself.

01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:37.540
Dave, man.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.625
Benji.

01:09:41.541 --> 01:09:42.790
I, like... I walk around with, like,

01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:45.040
this terrible fucking image
of you in my head,

01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:46.124
- okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:47.375
And, yeah, I don't...

01:09:47.958 --> 01:09:49.875
Yeah, I don't wanna lose you, okay?

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:53.416
Do you see how people love you?

01:09:55.166 --> 01:09:57.541
Do you see what happens
when you walk into a room?

01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:04.250
I would give anything to know
what that feels like... man.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.833
To know what it feels like to have charm.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.166
To light up a room when I walk in.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.915
But you light up a room
and then you, like,

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:19.540
shit on everything inside of it.

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:07.290
All right. You can go.

01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:08.375
Thanks.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.083
Taxi's here.

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:11.750
Let me see.

01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:15.749
See a 25 anywhere?

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.540
No, I don't see any numbers
anywhere. Wait.

01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:19.707
Me neither.

01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:22.125
Okay, wait. I think it should
be around this way.

01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:26.790
"Mag-is-trate."
What do you think that means?

01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:28.541
-  Probably magistrate.
-  Oh.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:29.958
I think so.

01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:33.041
Is this like a real street or...

01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:35.250
Twenty-eight.

01:12:36.666 --> 01:12:37.666
I think it's this.

01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:40.625
-  Here?
-  Yeah.

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:56.208
Twenty-five.

01:12:58.666 --> 01:12:59.666
Oh, my God.

01:13:01.125 --> 01:13:03.250
Whoa. Is that possible?

01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:08.915
It's so... unremarkable.

01:13:08.916 --> 01:13:11.791
Yeah. I guess I don't know
what I pictured.

01:13:12.708 --> 01:13:13.916
Yeah. Me neither.

01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:27.708
You know she slapped me once, right?

01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:29.624
What?

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:31.624
Yeah. Grandma slapped me.

01:13:31.625 --> 01:13:33.415
- Shit. Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:35.499
I was late to meet her for dinner.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.540
- Just, like, 15 minutes.
- Yeah.

01:13:37.541 --> 01:13:38.749
Also, I was pretty high.

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:40.790
It was at that Hudson
restaurant on Third Avenue.

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.540
You know, in the purgatory of Murray Hill.

01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:44.124
Yes, I know it. Shit. Did it hurt?

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:45.207
The fuck, yeah, it hurt.

01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:46.290
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.708
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:52.040
I was, like, elated for
a full 24 hours after that.

01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:54.374
- Really? Why?
- I don't know why.

01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:56.499
I mean, it was at this fucking restaurant

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.874
she went to every week.
Everyone knew her there.

01:13:58.875 --> 01:14:00.499
She dressed up all formal for it

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.165
like it was some
big fucking occasion, and...

01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:03.707
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

01:14:03.708 --> 01:14:05.165
I guess the fact that
she cared more about me

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:07.874
than what the people
at the restaurant thought?

01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:09.207
I don't know.

01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:10.625
Made me feel good.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.500
Hey.

01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:15.749
I got an idea.

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:16.957
Hmm. What?

01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:18.957
Let's put a stone on the stoop.

01:14:18.958 --> 01:14:20.040
What do you mean?

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:21.874
I mean, let's find a little stone

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:23.832
and put it on the stoop
to say that we were here.

01:14:23.833 --> 01:14:25.665
That she's not, you know, forgotten.

01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:27.665
- She's not buried here.
- Yeah, I know.

01:14:27.666 --> 01:14:30.290
But this is the last place
she was in Poland.

01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:31.916
It's the last place any of us were.

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:35.749
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:37.041
- It's a good idea.
- Okay.

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.207
Yeah. Not this. No.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:41.291
No, no.

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:44.582
- One, two.
- Yeah?

01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:45.790
Yeah, I found two.

01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:47.374
- Do you want one?
- Yeah.

01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:48.458
Thanks.

01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:50.250
Uh, yeah.

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:05.250
<i>Hej!</i>

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.040
<i>- Zabierzcie te kamienie.</i>
-  Oh.

01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:09.832
<i>Co wy tam robicie?
Przecież tam mieszkają ludzie.</i>

01:15:09.833 --> 01:15:12.374
Hi. Sorry, we're Americans.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.040
English? Do you speak English?

01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:16.500
<i>Mówię, że mieszkają ludzie
i trzeba to zabrać.</i>

01:15:17.041 --> 01:15:19.083
Sorry. I don't... know.

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:22.665
-  I guess that's it.
-  Yeah.

01:15:22.666 --> 01:15:23.999
I feel like such an asshole saying,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.332
"Americans, Americans."

01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:26.415
That's what we are.

01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:27.707
Do you think he's mad about this?

01:15:27.708 --> 01:15:28.790
Maybe he's offering us breakfast.

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:29.874
- I don't fucking know.
- You're right.

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:30.957
He could be offering breakfast.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:32.040
It could just be that. "So come up here,

01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:33.124
"have some fucking cakes."

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.707
"Have some delicious... black pudding."

01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:35.916
Oh, there's more.

01:15:36.583 --> 01:15:38.333
- Hello.
<i>- Niech sprzątną.</i>

01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:40.291
Okay, uh,

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:41.999
do you speak English?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.165
- Yes. Yeah.
- A little.

01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:45.207
Well, hi.
Sorry, what's the problem?

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:48.165
Uh, my father said that you placed rocks,

01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:49.540
uh, on the door?

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.374
Yeah, we did. Our grandma lived here,

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:53.416
and she just died.

01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:55.665
Oh.

01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:57.207
Sorry for your loss.

01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:58.665
Oh. Thanks, man.

01:15:58.666 --> 01:16:02.582
So why did you put rocks
in front of the door?

01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:04.999
It's like a tradition.
It's like a Jewish tradition.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.790
Like, when you visit somebody's grave,

01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:08.332
you're supposed to put, like, a rock on it

01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:10.249
to show that you were, you know, there.

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:12.874
Yeah, but she's not buried
under the door, right?

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:14.332
No, no, no. We just kind of

01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:16.207
did it as, like, a sentimental thing.

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:17.624
Like, as a, you know, a gesture.

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:18.707
Okay. Yeah.

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:20.374
- Just a gesture. Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.624
Okay. Senti... Okay.

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:24.290
I understand. So, this is sweet, I think.

01:16:24.291 --> 01:16:25.832
-  Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:27.500
Wait a moment. Uh...

01:16:28.166 --> 01:16:31.915
<i>Oni mówią, że
to jest ich żydowska tradycja,</i>

01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:34.332
<i>żeby położyć kamień jakby na grobie.</i>

01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:37.666
<i>No ale tu nie ma grobu,
ale ich babcia tu mieszkała.</i>

01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:42.375
<i>No dobrze...
A teraz mieszka ta stara...</i>

01:16:42.916 --> 01:16:44.000
<i>Niech zabiorą.</i>

01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:47.499
Okay, guys. Um...

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.415
I'm sorry, but, um,
I understand your situation.

01:16:50.416 --> 01:16:52.708
But my father said that it is, uh,

01:16:53.416 --> 01:16:56.291
a hazard to leave the stones.

01:16:56.791 --> 01:16:57.790
Okay.

01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:59.582
You know, an older woman lives there now,

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:01.832
- so she could trip or...
-  Right.

01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:03.082
- Okay.
- Understood.

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:04.915
- So, we must, you know...
-  No, I got it.

01:17:04.916 --> 01:17:07.000
You got it. Sorry. Yeah.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.750
There you are.

01:17:12.958 --> 01:17:14.166
All right.

01:18:21.041 --> 01:18:22.207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:23.290
<i>in about a half an hour,</i>

01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:25.415
<i>we will begin our descent to New York.</i>

01:18:25.416 --> 01:18:27.082
<i>We caught a lucky break there.</i>

01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:29.457
<i>We're gonna get you to your
gate about 15 minutes ahead.</i>

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:30.624
<i>Due to construction,</i>

01:18:30.625 --> 01:18:32.957
<i>the gate assignment may have changed.</i>

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.749
<i>Please check your boarding pass</i>

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:36.707
<i>for possible gate changes.</i>

01:18:36.708 --> 01:18:39.250
<i>We appreciate your patience and thank you.</i>

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:42.790
Hey, I was thinking,

01:18:42.791 --> 01:18:44.540
why don't we, like,
grab a cab back to the city

01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:46.707
and you could come over for dinner?

01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:47.790
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:49.332
I mean, I know Priya
would love to see you,

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:51.582
and Abe would, you know, love to tell you

01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:53.415
every fact about the Statue of Liberty.

01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:56.874
Uh...

01:18:56.875 --> 01:18:58.291
- It's tempting.
- Yo, come on.

01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:00.415
Um...

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:01.915
Nah, that's okay, man.

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:03.165
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:04.332
All right. Well, at least, I don't know,

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:05.790
let's grab a cab back to the city

01:19:05.791 --> 01:19:07.290
and I can drop you off at Penn Station

01:19:07.291 --> 01:19:08.957
for your train upstate.

01:19:08.958 --> 01:19:10.082
Um...

01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:11.374
You know what? I think I'm probably

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:13.833
just gonna kick it here
for a little while.

01:19:15.416 --> 01:19:16.416
At the airport?

01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:18.624
Yeah. Kinda like it here.

01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:20.207
You meet the craziest people, man.

01:19:20.208 --> 01:19:21.291
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:24.791 --> 01:19:26.165
- Shit.
- What the flying fuck, man?

01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:27.457
- I'm so sorry. Fuck.
- Why would you do that?

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:28.874
Because Grandma, the restaurant. You said

01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:30.457
it was, like, the best thing
that ever happened to you.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:31.790
Yeah, but that was
different, man. I was 18.

01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:32.874
- I needed direction.
- No, I know.

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:34.082
That makes sense. I am so sorry.

01:19:34.083 --> 01:19:35.540
- This is just violence.
- I know, I know.

01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:36.665
I thought it would, you know, enliven...

01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:37.749
- I don't know.
- It's okay.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:39.290
Are you okay?
Can I see? You're, like, red.

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:40.957
Yeah. Because you fuckin'
slapped me in the face.

01:19:40.958 --> 01:19:42.040
Sorry.

01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:43.749
- Do I get one now?
- No.

01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:48.916
I'm sorry, man.

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:50.875
Come here.

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:57.124
I love you, guy.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:58.375
Love you too.

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:03.250
I'm gonna be fine.

01:20:03.958 --> 01:20:04.958
You know that?

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:07.875
-  You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:11.957
Sorry.

01:20:11.958 --> 01:20:13.666
- You weren't done.
-  Mm-mm.

01:20:17.541 --> 01:20:18.874
All right.

01:20:18.875 --> 01:20:20.208
I'll see you around, cuz. Okay?

01:20:20.791 --> 01:20:21.875
I'll see you.

01:21:12.333 --> 01:21:15.000

01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:17.582
