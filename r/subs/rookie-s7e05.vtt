00:02.128 --> 00:03.253
<i>Previously
on "The Rookie"...</i>

00:03.254 --> 00:04.671
<i>Hey, Counselor.
Harrison Novak.</i>

00:04.672 --> 00:06.465
They're all wrapped the same.
They must be yours.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.049
These aren't mine.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.467
- Thanks for coming right over.
- Yeah, of course.

00:09.468 --> 00:10.719
It seems clear that we have

00:10.720 --> 00:12.345
<i>a second serial killer
at large.</i>

00:14.390 --> 00:15.598
- And you are?
- Her husband.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.517
Oscar and Jason just
escaped from prison.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.602
Who's out there?

00:19.603 --> 00:21.938
Show me your hands.
- Oh, my God. Don't shoot me.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.565
I got a call from Detroit PD.

00:23.566 --> 00:25.608
They pulled prints
from a liquor store robbery

00:25.609 --> 00:27.277
last night--Jason Wyler's.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.361
Who are you?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.197
I'm the man hunting
your ex-husband.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.407
- Ahh!
- Malvado.

00:32.408 --> 00:34.744
If you hear of Jason's
whereabouts, let me know.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.250
What's that?

00:42.251 --> 00:43.793
Oh, a secret note
from my secret lover.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.336
Where do you find the energy?

00:45.337 --> 00:47.213
I barely have the strength
for one lover.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.590
I know. I've been meaning
to talk to you

00:48.591 --> 00:50.425
about putting
some more effort in.

00:50.426 --> 00:52.010
That's fair.
You working today?

00:52.011 --> 00:53.928
Yep, and I see
you're going in early.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.930
Yeah, I'm going to talk to
that, uh, detective in Detroit,

00:55.931 --> 00:57.932
see if they have
any updates on Jason.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.601
Do you really believe

00:59.602 --> 01:01.770
my psychotic ex-husband
is on the run?

01:01.771 --> 01:03.897
Well, it seems like it.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.356
You can't be too careful.

01:05.357 --> 01:08.693
I'm just happy to get some
normalcy back in our lives,

01:08.694 --> 01:10.820
where normalcy means, you know,
double serial killers.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.030
Well, on the bright side,

01:12.031 --> 01:13.948
at least one of them
is already in custody.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.200
Always the optimist.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.076
It's my secret lover's
favorite thing about me.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.078
Well, see,
that's what separates us.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.581
I could never pick
only one favorite thing.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.918
Have a great day.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.837
You too.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.165
Oh, uh, Mrs. Richards?

02:04.166 --> 02:06.960
- That's right.
- Hi, I'm Lucy Chen.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.628
Um, I was hoping to talk to you
about your former student

02:08.629 --> 02:09.671
Seth Ridley.

02:09.672 --> 02:11.297
I'm his training officer
at the LAPD.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.550
- Is he in trouble?
- No, not at all.

02:13.551 --> 02:15.301
I was just looking to get
some clarity on some things,

02:15.302 --> 02:17.220
and I thought
the school guidance counselor

02:17.221 --> 02:19.222
would be the best person
to ask.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.348
All right, then.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.559
Well, better come in.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.561
Thank you.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.312
What about you?

02:26.313 --> 02:27.897
Sorry.
What?

02:27.898 --> 02:30.400
She asked if you were feeling
any more secure in the job.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.569
Oh, totally, totally. I--

02:32.570 --> 02:34.737
Not. Totally not.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.407
Would--would you actually
be able to put in a good word

02:37.408 --> 02:38.700
for me with your roommate?

02:38.701 --> 02:41.411
That would--
I would owe you big-time.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.787
Hey.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.038
Huh?

02:44.039 --> 02:46.457
Think we'll be end of shift
by 8:00 tonight?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.502
Ah, I-I mean, there's
a serial killer on the loose.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.421
I wouldn't expect
to clock out on time.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.506
There's got to be
some kind of work-life balance

02:53.507 --> 02:55.842
eventually, though, right?
- Not as a rookie.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.428
I haven't been on a date
in three months.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.762
Why?
What's at 8:00 p.m.?

02:59.763 --> 03:02.348
He's got a long-distance love
with the missus.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.434
- Oh.
- We ain't married, all right?

03:04.435 --> 03:05.852
Just exclusive
since high school.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.687
Camilla's still in Texas
looking for the right time

03:07.688 --> 03:08.771
to move out.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.565
And live in your car.

03:10.566 --> 03:11.900
I'll find a place
before then.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.568
She's my angel.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.445
Got with me when
I was gonna make football money

03:15.446 --> 03:17.447
and stayed with me when
I got hurt and lost it all.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.490
She sacrificed
a hell of a lot for me.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.534
Oh, I mean,
you must miss her so much.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.871
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I do.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.457
All right.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.472
Whoa!

03:48.562 --> 03:49.896
Bad news--

03:49.897 --> 03:51.814
Remy Darden succumbed
to his injuries this morning.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.484
So you're
the only living witness.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.486
Which means
we have jack squat,

03:56.487 --> 03:58.780
because the only description
I can give of our serial killer

03:58.781 --> 04:02.450
is white male, unknown age,
somewhere near 6 feet,

04:02.451 --> 04:05.578
and somewhere
around 175 pounds.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.665
- But it's better than nothing.
- Not by much.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.708
Hey, brought you
some fresh clothes,

04:10.709 --> 04:12.627
in case you want
to change after,

04:12.628 --> 04:14.504
and the appropriate shoes
to match.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.839
- Always so thoughtful.
- Ah, well-trained.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.637
Are you okay?

04:22.638 --> 04:24.597
My heart hurts.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.391
So much pain before they died.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.476
I knew in my mind
such evil exists,

04:28.477 --> 04:31.187
but it always shocks
my soul to see it.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.941
- Good morning.
- Oh, morning.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.819
How you feeling?
- Fine. Day off helped.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.988
I wish I could say
I found something helpful

04:39.989 --> 04:41.948
in your absence, but I did not.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.992
- No DNA?
- The opposite--too much.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.619
I found trace evidence of
literally hundreds of people

04:46.620 --> 04:48.746
contaminating
both the murder lab

04:48.747 --> 04:50.873
and the bodies of our
serial killer's ten victims.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.500
How is that possible?

04:52.501 --> 04:54.794
Oh, he muddied the scene
with a DNA buffet.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.629
He literally collected
medical waste--

04:56.630 --> 04:59.007
sharps, latex gloves,
discarded bandages--

04:59.008 --> 05:01.676
and he used them to corrupt
everything that he touched.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.761
That's kind of brilliant.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.638
Uh, in a pure, evil way.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.057
I mean, even if we can pull his
DNA from a victim and match it,

05:08.058 --> 05:09.892
any defense attorney
with a pulse

05:09.893 --> 05:11.769
will be able to prove
reasonable doubt.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.022
I'm afraid I have
more troubling news.

05:14.023 --> 05:15.898
The autopsies revealed
that all but one of the victims

05:15.899 --> 05:18.484
were infected with a variety
of bloodborne illnesses

05:18.485 --> 05:20.570
before he strangled
them to death.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.238
- From the used syringes?
- Yeah.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.782
He was literally using them
like a science experiment.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.576
But before you panic,

05:26.577 --> 05:28.661
we found the needle he used
on you and tested it.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.079
I wouldn't say it was clean,

05:30.080 --> 05:32.540
but there was
nothing communicable within.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.625
We'll get you regular testing
for the next six months.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.711
But if they didn't find
anything in the needle,

05:36.712 --> 05:38.921
you should be okay.
- Okay.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.715
But on the good news front,

05:40.716 --> 05:42.717
most of the medical waste
was generic,

05:42.718 --> 05:44.594
found in every hospital
and doctor's office

05:44.595 --> 05:46.596
around the state, except
for these four syringes,

05:46.597 --> 05:47.805
which are trial design,

05:47.806 --> 05:49.807
only used
at Saint Stephen Hospital.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.267
You could have led with that.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.810
He's an actor.
He likes the drama.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.020
Former actor.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.813
And I like setting
realistic expectations.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.523
All right,
so, just to be clear,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.108
we're looking for a white male
of indeterminate age,

05:59.109 --> 06:00.610
height, weight,

06:00.611 --> 06:01.944
with some form of connection

06:01.945 --> 06:04.030
to Westview
Psychiatric Institution

06:04.031 --> 06:05.907
and Saint Stephen Hospital--

06:05.908 --> 06:09.702
places that employ and treat
thousands of people a year.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.704
Talk about setting
expectations.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.623
And here I was,
feeling hopeful.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.707
Sorry.

06:23.175 --> 06:26.677
You know, I've been, uh,
really studying my rook book.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.679
I've been burning
the midnight oil.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.599
Miles and I are going to go
to the range later on,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.935
do some extra shooting.

06:33.936 --> 06:38.064
I visited your high school
this morning, Ridley.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.609
Uh, that's cool.
Why?

06:41.610 --> 06:43.569
Because I wanted some clarity

06:43.570 --> 06:46.114
about your high school
experience.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.075
And?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.120
Why don't you
tell me, Ridley?

06:52.121 --> 06:53.996
What--what exactly
did I discover?

06:53.997 --> 06:56.124
You found out
that I was telling the truth

06:56.125 --> 06:59.085
about my friend who OD'd...

06:59.086 --> 07:01.671
And that she was not
my girlfriend.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.756
And I did go on a date
with her a couple months

07:03.757 --> 07:05.883
before Rory Hatcher's party.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.636
And I did give her CPR,

07:08.637 --> 07:12.599
but Rory Hatcher's dad
actually saved her.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.728
And?

07:18.730 --> 07:22.191
And you discovered
that I lied to you and Miles

07:22.192 --> 07:24.652
about the girl who died
in a car accident.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.654
And she was not
my girlfriend either.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.615
I was actually a freshman
when she was a senior,

07:29.616 --> 07:32.994
and I've never met the girl.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.999
Do you want to know
why I lied?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.792
I can figure that out
for myself.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.628
Well, what if I told you that
I was ashamed of what I did

07:42.629 --> 07:44.797
and that I have
struggled in the past

07:44.798 --> 07:48.134
using these half-truths
to get me out of trouble?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.803
Just--I've sworn to myself
that I wasn't going to be

07:50.804 --> 07:52.805
this guy anymore
when I joined the LAPD.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.726
But then I threw up
in a crime scene on day one,

07:56.727 --> 07:59.937
and I panicked, and I should
have owned up to my failures,

07:59.938 --> 08:01.397
but I just--

08:01.398 --> 08:05.819
I should have suffered
the consequences.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.867
What are the consequences?

08:12.868 --> 08:14.869
I don't--I don't know yet.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.871
We have an onsite incinerator
in the basement.

08:16.872 --> 08:19.081
It's where all of our
medical waste is disposed.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.083
- Who has access to it?
- Custodial staff.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.086
Plus, we have
a dedicated incineration team.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.963
Everyone's passed
background checks.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.340
But a few months ago,

08:27.341 --> 08:29.967
our security staff found
a patient, Ryan Dearbourne,

08:29.968 --> 08:32.845
wandering around the basement
with a medical bag.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.014
At the time,
he claimed he was lost.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.724
Couldn't explain the bag.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.975
Back in Texas,

08:37.976 --> 08:39.977
we call that clue
"sweeter than stolen honey."

08:39.978 --> 08:42.772
- I like him.
- No comment.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.398
Are you seeing anyone?

08:44.399 --> 08:47.109
Because I have a niece who has
had it up to here with LA guys.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.695
If she's anywhere
near as lovely as you,

08:49.696 --> 08:51.280
I'm sure she'll have
her pick of men.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.824
Unfortunately, I am taken.
- It's long distance.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.284
He'll be single soon enough.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.245
What do you have against
long-distance relationships?

08:57.246 --> 08:58.871
They aren't relationships.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.249
The day-to-day support, the way
you weave your lives together,

09:01.250 --> 09:02.792
that's a relationship.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.961
Chatting on Zoom is
a friendship at best.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.754
Thank you for the intel.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.006
He and Rachel broke up
when she moved to New York.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.925
Ah, I see.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.218
Don't listen to him.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.720
Relationships
come in all forms.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.932
- Let's go, Boot.
- Nice to meet you.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.310
All right, Ryan Dearbourne

09:21.311 --> 09:24.063
has been a repeat patient
at Westview Psychiatric

09:24.064 --> 09:25.982
since he was a teenager.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.859
His most recent stint
was 16 months ago.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.111
Schizophrenia,

09:30.112 --> 09:31.904
borderline personality
disorder,

09:31.905 --> 09:33.239
drug addiction.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.157
Has he ever crossed paths
with Harrison Novak?

09:35.158 --> 09:37.952
He did.
At least he could have.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.122
There is a two-month overlap
during their teenage years.

09:41.123 --> 09:44.125
Okay.
So what do you think?

09:44.126 --> 09:45.793
Whew.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.796
I think it looks like
a cautionary tale

09:48.797 --> 09:51.215
for how society fails those
with mental health issues.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.760
I mean, what do you think
about how we should approach?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.263
Oh, right, well, uh,

09:57.264 --> 10:00.016
I mean, we don't have
probable cause to enter.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.767
So...

10:01.768 --> 10:05.021
first step is to try to get
the suspect into the open.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.856
We could simply knock
on the door,

10:06.857 --> 10:08.941
but due to his history
of violence,

10:08.942 --> 10:11.193
it might be better
to avoid surprises.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.778
Good.
So?

10:12.779 --> 10:15.282
- We call him.
- Perfect. Do it.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.835
Hi?

10:27.836 --> 10:29.545
Mr. Dearbourne?

10:29.546 --> 10:32.840
This is Officer Celina Juarez
with LAPD.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.508
We're outside.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.969
And we're hoping we could speak
with you, if you wouldn't mind.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.265
Okay, well,
that was disturbing.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.185
7-Adam-15, requesting
additional units

10:44.186 --> 10:46.896
and an RA to my location.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.147
Hey, go cover the rear.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.845
In position.
No sign of suspect.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.138
Copy that.

11:21.139 --> 11:25.142
I'm at the front door,
making entry.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.602
Police.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.940
Mr. Dearbourne,
I'm coming inside.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.150
Stand where I can see you

11:33.151 --> 11:35.403
with your hands open
and visible.

11:40.909 --> 11:44.120
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.913
Do it now.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.096
Inside's clear.

12:02.097 --> 12:05.141
Copy that. Maybe he wasn't
in there when we called.

12:05.142 --> 12:08.102
Negative.
His soup is still steaming.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.105
He must have jumped into the
woods the second we pulled up.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.988
No, no, okay.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.993
Nolan, I'm hearing a voice

12:23.994 --> 12:26.078
from underneath
the mobile home.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.383
I got a hatch in the floor.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.969
I'm gonna open it now.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.358
- Hey, do you have a second?
- Sure.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.986
Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.198
Um, okay, so I have confirmed
that Seth lied to me

13:02.199 --> 13:04.283
on two separate occasions
about past tragedies.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.952
Not great.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.996
That's it--"not great"?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.331
I mean,
a third of the department

13:10.332 --> 13:12.124
routinely lies
about their personal life.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.168
Do you honestly think Smitty
qualified for the Olympics?

13:14.169 --> 13:15.461
No, but--

13:15.462 --> 13:17.379
There's a difference
between lying on the job

13:17.380 --> 13:19.048
and lying about the job.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.383
Look, has he ever lied
about a call or on paperwork?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.386
- Not that I know of.
- Okay.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.472
Look, the city spent a quarter
of a million training Ridley.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.224
The department's
currently understaffed

13:28.225 --> 13:30.059
due to a major
corruption scandal,

13:30.060 --> 13:31.977
and he was recently
lauded as a hero

13:31.978 --> 13:33.354
for saving a hostage's life.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.064
Grey's not going to cut
him just because he brags.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.398
Wait, I can't believe

13:36.399 --> 13:39.026
Tim "I Bounce Boots
for Breakfast" Bradford

13:39.027 --> 13:41.403
is suggesting letting
unethical behavior slide.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.406
I'm not.
I'm suggesting you correct it.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.325
It's what we call
a "TO problem."

13:46.326 --> 13:48.369
Wow, okay.
Thank you.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.496
Mm-hmm.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.249
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.251
Listen...

13:55.252 --> 13:56.460
I really love this job.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.379
I have never lied about that.

13:58.380 --> 14:02.132
I just--I get panicked
sometimes, and I get stressed.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.052
Ridley, being a cop
is stressful 24-7.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.596
Being--being cross-examined
is just as stressful.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.390
What are you going to do
when you're on the stand,

14:09.391 --> 14:12.101
tell the truth or say
whatever makes you look good?

14:12.102 --> 14:14.061
The truth.
I'm gonna tell the truth, okay?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.354
It's--100%.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.316
This has been an important
wake-up call for me.

14:19.317 --> 14:23.028
I promise you, I'm gonna
fly right from here on out.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.073
He said the needles
were for his medicine

14:26.074 --> 14:30.536
and that just a quick rinse,
and they were "good as new."

14:30.537 --> 14:32.454
That might be
the most disgusting thing

14:32.455 --> 14:33.998
I've ever heard.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.416
So what do you think?

14:35.417 --> 14:38.085
Is this the guy you fought
in the basement?

14:38.086 --> 14:40.212
I don't know.
He feels wrong.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.132
I mean, this guy is
literally buzzing with energy.

14:43.133 --> 14:47.094
The killer we're after
was calm, fastidious, careful,

14:47.095 --> 14:49.179
and dangerously smart.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.473
I can't imagine this guy
making a peanut butter sandwich

14:51.474 --> 14:53.309
without cutting off
something important.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.144
Maybe that's
what he wants us to think--

14:55.145 --> 14:57.146
laying the groundwork
for an insanity plea.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.106
If so he deserves an Oscar.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.567
So do you want to talk to him
or lay back?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.277
Lay back.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.070
Okay.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.073
Mr. Dearbourne.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.533
Hi.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.661
I'm Brendon Acres with the FBI.
This is Detective Lopez.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.496
I take it you've been apprised
of your rights.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.081
Is that correct?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.500
I didn't do anything.
I-I-I never do anything.

15:18.501 --> 15:22.379
Can you tell us
where you were two nights ago?

15:22.380 --> 15:26.091
Down below, the underneath.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.177
Are you talking
about a basement?

15:28.178 --> 15:30.638
It's my happy place.

15:30.639 --> 15:34.183
I want to go
to my happy place.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.320
Nice to be home?

15:46.321 --> 15:48.656
So nice, especially
now that the threat

15:48.657 --> 15:53.160
of my crazy ex-husband is gone,
at least for the moment.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.495
You'll get through this.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.413
We're all here for you,
whatever you guys need.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.708
Thank you.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.211
Uh, sorry.
I have to get this.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.505
- Of course. Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.471
Hello?
- Tell me about Detroit.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.390
I shouldn't be talking
to you.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.684
Then why did you text
or answer this call?

16:16.685 --> 16:19.395
Tell me about Detroit.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.230
Jason's fingerprints
were pulled

16:21.231 --> 16:22.523
from a liquor store he robbed.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.484
Same thing outside Provo, Utah,
two days before.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.236
Seems a little sloppy
for our boy.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.571
- You think it's a fake out?
<i>- I don't know. Maybe not.</i>

16:29.572 --> 16:31.448
People do have a tendency
to run for the hills

16:31.449 --> 16:32.908
when they hear
that I'm looking for them.

16:32.909 --> 16:33.909
I have my feelers out.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.411
<i>I'll know more soon enough.</i>

16:36.538 --> 16:38.163
<i>I might have something.</i>

16:38.164 --> 16:39.373
So I was going

16:39.374 --> 16:41.208
through Antoinette's
initial autopsy reports.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.210
All of the victims
were cross-contaminated

16:43.211 --> 16:45.546
with dirty needles before
they were killed, except one--

16:45.547 --> 16:48.465
his very first victim,
Grant Nogales.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.426
First kills
are often unique--

16:50.427 --> 16:51.593
the thrill of raw violence

16:51.594 --> 16:53.595
before a serial killer
hones their style.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.556
Right, and they can also be
the most personal.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.683
So I went back into Grant's
missing person file.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.185
One of the people
the detectives interviewed

17:00.186 --> 17:01.687
was his former employer,
Liam Glasser.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.480
Now, Glasser was never
a suspect,

17:03.481 --> 17:05.733
but he runs a vending machine
supply company

17:05.734 --> 17:08.152
that services facilities
all across Los Angeles,

17:08.153 --> 17:11.155
including Westview Psychiatric.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.073
Any connection
to Saint Stephen?

17:13.074 --> 17:14.283
Not that I could find.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.076
You should definitely put
eyes on Glasser.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.953
See if you recognize him
from the other night.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.788
Yeah,
but I don't want him to know

17:19.789 --> 17:21.790
that he might be a suspect.
- Yeah.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.876
I have an idea.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.961
Glad you could come
on such short notice.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.379
Are you kidding me?

17:27.380 --> 17:30.215
I'd give my firstborn to
service all the LAPD machines.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.384
You really got that kind
of pull with the city?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.136
Oh, yeah.
I'm the man.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.389
These all look
like pretty standard fare.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.934
I was hoping
for more of the, uh, exotics.

17:40.935 --> 17:44.104
Oh, this is just a small
sampling of what we carry.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.565
Was there, uh, something
specific you had in mind?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.108
There's a New Zealand nut bar

17:48.109 --> 17:50.277
that I could only find
at the zoo.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.030
The Kiwi Krispie.
I have that.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.907
- No way.
- Oh, yeah.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.242
It's not on the truck, but
I could land it in slot, uh, 22

17:57.243 --> 17:59.286
first thing in the morning,
if that seals the deal.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.121
Smitty,
Grey's looking for you.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.415
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.043
It's never an interruption

18:06.044 --> 18:07.586
when a woman
is as pretty as you.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.048
- Oh, wow. Smooth talker.
- Guilty as charged.

18:11.049 --> 18:14.134
But don't let me stop important
police business from happening.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.719
I got work to do, too.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.056
I'm gonna go talk to
Grey, and I will circle back.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.058
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.064
Actually...

18:27.065 --> 18:29.274
you might be able
to help me out with something.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.860
Happy to,

18:31.861 --> 18:34.822
unless this is just a ploy
to hit on me,

18:34.823 --> 18:36.907
because I am
a happily married man.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.159
Who tells random women
they're pretty?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.286
- Well, men can look.
- Oh.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.163
So what can I do
for you, uh...

18:43.164 --> 18:45.290
Uh, Nyla Harper, detective.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.168
It's nice to meet you,
Nyla Harper, detective.

18:48.169 --> 18:52.047
I'm Liam Glasser, uh,
lord of the vending machines.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.383
Ah, that is actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.177
Um, okay, so I have this case.

18:57.178 --> 19:00.305
It is a serial murder
investigation.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.308
And there are connections
to Westview Psychiatric.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.978
Get--get out of here.
I-I service Westview.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.437
- You're kidding.
- No.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.273
Well, that is small world.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.942
For how long?
- Uh, I mean, like, forever.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.902
Uh, it's my dad's company.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.988
I started working with him
in high school.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.448
I took it over when he passed,
so more than 20 years.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.325
How often are you there?

19:20.326 --> 19:23.328
I average, uh,
three or four visits a month.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.289
I mean, the food
is terrible there,

19:25.290 --> 19:26.915
so the patients and the staff,

19:26.916 --> 19:28.375
they basically live
off the machines.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.168
Okay.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.922
I hate to impose, but there are
elements of this case

19:33.923 --> 19:36.675
that date back
to over a decade ago.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.344
And talking to someone
with institutional knowledge

19:39.345 --> 19:41.346
would be extremely helpful.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.183
The staff has been stonewalling
me, trying to cover their ass.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.185
You know how that is.
- Oh, yeah, it's human nature.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.353
Exactly.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.106
Um, can you help me?

19:51.107 --> 19:54.318
Well, um, as much as
I would love to spend the day

19:54.319 --> 19:57.321
talking to you,
I got a schedule to keep.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.239
Please, I promise it
won't take that long.

20:02.076 --> 20:03.201
I'd owe you.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.248
Sure. I can--I can spare
a few minutes.

20:08.249 --> 20:11.460
Great. I will go grab
my file and my notebook.

20:20.303 --> 20:23.263
I think Glasser is my guy.
He's the second killer.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.015
Well, that's a surprise,

20:25.016 --> 20:28.060
'cause Ryan Dearbourne
is currently confessing.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.311
What?

20:29.312 --> 20:30.771
I couldn't stop.

20:30.772 --> 20:34.274
I needed them to hurt
the way I hurt, the way I hurt.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.234
So I jabbed them.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.404
I jabbed them,
and I killed them.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.077
Who was the third victim?

20:48.164 --> 20:50.082
Third kill.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.543
M-M-M-M-Michael--Michael.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.088
Skid row.

20:56.089 --> 21:00.175
He helped me find that place
right between the toes--

21:00.176 --> 21:03.971
the most painful bone,
lots of nerves.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.098
But anywhere you poke,
poke, poke too often,

21:06.099 --> 21:07.599
they get used to it.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.435
A-and I always had
a lot of needles to poke.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.437
I stole them from the hospital.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.107
But this morning,
you told Officer Nolan

21:15.108 --> 21:18.151
that you used those needles
in your house for medicine.

21:18.152 --> 21:21.196
Yes, for me

21:21.197 --> 21:22.447
and for them.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.408
Tell us about Remy.

21:24.409 --> 21:27.327
Got away.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.453
Bye-bye.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.497
How did he get away?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.794
What happened the other night
when he got away?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.463
Nothing.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.465
Everything.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.343
Danger.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.512
Please, I-I just want it
to stop.

21:45.513 --> 21:48.348
I-I need someone to stop me.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.142
Please.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.185
I need to be punished.

21:52.186 --> 21:55.147
I've done such bad things...

21:55.148 --> 21:57.065
such bad things.

22:01.487 --> 22:05.115
So did he get anything wrong?
Miss any detail?

22:05.116 --> 22:06.700
No, it was
a slam dunk confession.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.494
From a guy who is clearly in
the throes of mental illness.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.329
I mean, sure,
he gave us details,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.165
but he also left
a lot of holes.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.167
Those are details
only the killer could know.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.501
Or someone helping him.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.503
Listen, I know that my gut
is not admissible,

22:18.504 --> 22:21.173
but I am telling you, Glasser
is the guy from the basement.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.133
He recognized me
in the break room.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.302
He couldn't stop staring
at my wounds.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.304
He's still in there
with Smitty,

22:27.305 --> 22:29.514
waiting to talk to me.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.350
At least just put eyes on him.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.103
Check my math.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.730
Of course.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.648
The last thing I want to do
is charge the wrong guy

22:38.649 --> 22:40.358
or leave an accomplice
out there.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.526
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.404
Let's go.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.365
I swear,
she'll be right back.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.533
I'm sorry.
I got a route to run.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.243
I can't wait any longer.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.412
I am so sorry.
Thank you for waiting.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.539
I really got to go.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.374
Just talk to me
for two minutes.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.212
That's it. I promise.
Your stuff will be safe here.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.559
Thank you.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.729
So, um, do you have
any interactions

23:17.730 --> 23:20.315
with the patients at Westview?

23:20.316 --> 23:23.235
No.
I don't really stop to chat.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.569
I mean, not that
there's anything wrong

23:24.570 --> 23:26.571
with being mentally ill--
they can't help it.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.491
But, uh, I'm not really
looking to socialize.

23:29.492 --> 23:32.202
So is that a no?

23:32.203 --> 23:35.205
Yes, that is a no.

23:35.206 --> 23:40.168
So you have never talked to
someone named Ryan Dearbourne?

23:40.169 --> 23:43.588
Ah, like I said, I do
my business, and I get out.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.465
Okay.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.593
Is that the serial killer
you mentioned, Dearbourne?

23:48.594 --> 23:50.387
I can't really
comment on that.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.597
- Sure.
- Yeah.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.266
Sure.

23:54.267 --> 23:57.269
You can almost feel him
trying to be casual.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.689
If he is the guy,
he's rocking a world-class ego.

24:00.690 --> 24:03.234
It'll make him overconfident.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.281
Well, if there's
nothing else...

24:09.282 --> 24:10.532
I really got to go.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.285
Where were you
on Tuesday night?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.453
Why?

24:15.788 --> 24:17.497
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:17.498 --> 24:20.667
I meant to ask, um, were you
at Westview two nights ago?

24:20.668 --> 24:22.460
Something happened.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.297
Well, I don't work nights.
I have a family.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.631
Oh, kids?

24:26.632 --> 24:28.550
Yeah, two.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.760
What about you?

24:35.641 --> 24:38.518
What happened at Westview?

24:38.519 --> 24:41.271
There was an attack.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.273
Our suspect
almost killed a cop.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.192
No kidding.

24:45.193 --> 24:46.526
Wow.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.529
Well, like I said,
I wasn't there.

24:49.530 --> 24:52.199
Where were you?

24:52.200 --> 24:54.284
Movies maybe.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.453
I'd have to check.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.788
Now I really got to go.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.790
Good luck with your case.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.250
Of course.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.212
Uh, we will be in touch
if any follow-up is necessary.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.671
Looking forward to it.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.382
Okay.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.346
I hope you catch the guy.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.681
I mean, you must feel
such a weight

25:16.682 --> 25:19.517
being the only person
who can...

25:19.518 --> 25:22.396
bring his poor victims closure.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.275
Does it keep you up at night?

25:27.610 --> 25:30.862
It would--it would keep me up
at night.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.698
I sleep just fine.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.408
Do you?

25:35.409 --> 25:38.370
Hmm.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.288
Like a baby.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.718
Good job.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.720
- So how's my math?
- Solid.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.555
He's definitely giving off
some creepy vibes.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.057
Seemed very interested
in the case.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.850
I agree--
Ryan's involved somehow,

26:00.851 --> 26:03.645
but Glasser
is the dominant personality.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.563
But will a jury
see it that way?

26:05.564 --> 26:08.358
No, no, they'll see Ryan
stealing the syringes

26:08.359 --> 26:10.318
and Ryan confessing
to serial murder.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.903
Glasser is just
the hardworking family man

26:11.904 --> 26:13.530
who's barely tied to the case.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.948
Ryan's guilt feels genuine.

26:14.949 --> 26:17.409
I think he honestly believes
he committed the murders.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.827
What if Glasser
convinced him?

26:18.828 --> 26:20.745
You know, spent years
feeding him details

26:20.746 --> 26:22.372
until he internalized them?

26:22.373 --> 26:24.499
Well, we know Glasser
thinks long-term

26:24.500 --> 26:26.751
from the cross-contamination
of the kills he's been doing.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.546
Someone as disturbed as Ryan
can easily be manipulated.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.590
If that is true, then Glasser
has created the perfect patsy.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.634
So what do we do?

26:34.635 --> 26:36.761
Good news is,
he knows we're close.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.389
He won't risk another abduction
anytime soon.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.516
Yeah, but we need to be ready
when he does.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.393
I need every detail
about his work life--

26:43.394 --> 26:44.644
his--his clients, route.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.771
There has to be some
connection between him

26:46.772 --> 26:47.939
and the other victims.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.899
And let's pull apart
his family.

26:49.900 --> 26:54.529
I need a deep dive on his wife,
kids, third cousins, everyone.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.574
Oh, I'm--I'm so sorry
to interrupt.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.784
Nolan, Detroit PD is on
the phone looking for you.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.828
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.674
- Yeah?
<i>- Jason was never in Detroit.</i>

27:14.675 --> 27:16.843
<i>He paid some meth head
to leave his fingerprints</i>

27:16.844 --> 27:18.386
<i>at crime scenes.</i>

27:18.387 --> 27:20.472
Detroit PD
just arrested the guy.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.474
Jason is still in LA.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.854
John Nolan.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.804
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

28:19.532 --> 28:21.408
Oh, yeah!

28:21.409 --> 28:23.535
Oh, that'll get
the juices flowing, huh?

28:23.536 --> 28:24.744
Hey, babe.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.789
Oh, you don't look
so good back there.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.040
Oh, damn it.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.000
Oh,
I forgot to dump your phone.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.670
She's moving south
on La Cienega.

28:33.671 --> 28:36.005
<i>7-Adam-15, Bailey's partner
just called 911.</i>

28:36.006 --> 28:37.549
<i>Jason took her.</i>

28:37.550 --> 28:38.758
Celina.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.552
I know. I'm punching it.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.720
Stupid! Stupid!

28:42.721 --> 28:45.849
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

28:45.850 --> 28:49.853
Do I just pull over
or wait for the switch car?

28:49.854 --> 28:52.021
Pull over
and let me the hell out!

28:52.022 --> 28:54.774
Shut up!
Nobody's asking you!

28:54.775 --> 28:57.652
I am way past taking orders
from you, Jason.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.071
You don't scare me anymore.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.907
I said shut up.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.706
Ahh!
Bitch!

29:09.707 --> 29:11.541
Ugh!

29:20.926 --> 29:22.927
- Do you have her?
- Yeah.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.512
One minute out. Get ready.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.556
I'm so ready, baby.
Get here.

29:26.557 --> 29:27.932
Another life you're ruining.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.643
You're the one
that ruined a life--mine.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.020
Oh, boo-hoo.

29:32.021 --> 29:34.772
Jason, you're not
the hero of this story.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.107
You're not even the villain.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.817
You're Sideshow Bob,

29:37.818 --> 29:40.069
stepping on an infinite number
of rakes.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.825
Look, I would really not
provoke me right now.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.786
Why? Are you gonna
make it hurt more?

29:48.787 --> 29:51.873
Such a big man, torturing
a woman a third of your size.

29:51.874 --> 29:52.874
Shut up!

29:55.753 --> 29:56.794
Augh!

29:56.795 --> 29:59.130
Ahh!

30:23.531 --> 30:25.949
Oh, my God!

30:25.950 --> 30:28.827
They stopped, two blocks up
around the corner.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.124
[groans

30:35.125 --> 30:37.710
Oh, my God!
Baby, are you okay?

30:37.711 --> 30:40.880
-  Do I look okay?
- Don't yell at me!

30:40.881 --> 30:43.341
I'm freaking out here!
- Come on, we got to go.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.842
- Is she dead?
- I don't know.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.010
You got to make sure.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.720
Otherwise,
you'll never rest easy,

30:47.721 --> 30:49.722
and you'll never be all mine.
-  Yeah.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.641
Oh, God.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.018
She broke my arm!

30:54.019 --> 30:56.646
Come on, we don't have time.
We got to move.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.023
We won't make it to your car.
Come on, we--we got to go.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.817
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

31:15.124 --> 31:16.625
There she is.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.379
I'm here. I'm here.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.381
Easy.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.717
How bad are you hurt?
- I don't know.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.136
But he's hurt worse.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.097
He just ran off down
the alley with a woman.

31:31.098 --> 31:35.101
Um, blonde, uh,
pink sweatshirt.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.061
Control, suspect
Jason Wyler is on foot,

31:37.062 --> 31:39.397
heading west towards the 101--
he is armed and dangerous.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.733
Second suspect--
blonde female, pink sweatshirt.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.651
Mobilize backup, airship,

31:43.652 --> 31:46.654
and a supervisor
to set up a search grid.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.138
You're gonna be all right.
Ambulance is on the way.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.765
How did you know
to find me?

32:13.766 --> 32:15.016
Detroit PD called.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.976
Jason paid someone
to plant his fingerprints.

32:16.977 --> 32:18.436
I know.

32:18.437 --> 32:22.065
I mean, I-I knew
we shouldn't have trusted him.

32:22.066 --> 32:25.818
Oh, Jason's phone--
he left that before he ran off.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.821
Over here!
Quick!

32:28.822 --> 32:30.281
Easy. Nice and easy.
- I'm okay.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.117
Multiple contusions,
possible concussion,

32:33.118 --> 32:36.663
slight whiplash,
and some injury to my ribs.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.915
It's either fractured
or sprained--I'm not sure.

32:38.916 --> 32:40.917
- How's Bailey?
- Bailey is pissed.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.919
Ah, I'm gonna go
to the hospital with her.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.796
- Of course.
- Uh, this is Jason's phone.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.798
He called the woman
he ran off with

32:46.799 --> 32:48.883
right before we crashed.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.802
Hey, I-I need
a name and trace

32:50.803 --> 32:52.303
on this phone number right now.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.139
I'll have all the units
in the area lock down the grid.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.183
We're not gonna let
Jason get away again.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.727
All right, it's registered
to Drew Davis--

32:59.728 --> 33:03.731
uh, 28, female,
lives in La Cañada.

33:05.776 --> 33:06.859
I know her.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.152
No, she--she pretended
she was drunk.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.404
She broke into the yard.

33:09.405 --> 33:11.280
She said she was looking
for a friend's house.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.990
She must have been trying
to test out

33:12.991 --> 33:14.909
your security system for Jason.
- That's his move.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.828
Make some poor young woman
think he's in love with her

33:16.829 --> 33:18.287
and then ruin her life.
- Trace came in.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.164
It's a few blocks from here,
headed west on Sixth.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.126
Control, suspect's
heading west on Sixth Street

33:23.127 --> 33:26.045
toward Anderson--code 3.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.046
Go.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.840
- You sure?
- Go. Catch him.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.049
Okay.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.855
Oh, my God.

33:46.859 --> 33:49.235
What are we going to do?
- We--we got to get a car.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.945
- Well, can't we just hide?
- No, no, no.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.030
They're gonna have
this whole place locked down.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.825
Oh, no.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.994
Your phone.
- What?

33:57.995 --> 34:00.204
- They're tracking us.
- They know who I am?

34:00.205 --> 34:02.081
Why would they know who I am?
You said that I was fine!

34:02.082 --> 34:04.083
It doesn't matter!
Come here.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.334
All right.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.211
Okay, look, hey, you got to go
stop that car.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.213
I'm gonna come out with a gun,
and we're gonna jack it.

34:09.214 --> 34:12.884
Go. Go!

34:12.885 --> 34:13.885
Hi.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.988
Her phone's
at the end of the block.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.073
Oh, Nolan.
- I see her.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.288
7-Adam-15, we have eyes
on one suspect.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.207
Gunshot, possibly deceased.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.792
No sign of Jason yet.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.127
- Did Jason shoot her?
- I don't know.

34:48.128 --> 34:50.004
Let's move.

35:09.358 --> 35:11.943
I got eyes on Jason.
South side of the street.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.826
Jason!
Show me your hands!

35:23.288 --> 35:25.039
I give up!

35:25.040 --> 35:26.415
Step out!

35:26.416 --> 35:30.169
I can't.
Malvado--he's all over me.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.171
He killed Drew.
You got to protect me.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.465
Step out
and show me your hands.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.302
Damn it, he's got a rifle!

35:45.227 --> 35:48.187
7-Adam-15, shots fired.
Suspect is down.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.898
We have a sniper,
600 block of Anderson--

35:50.899 --> 35:52.358
precise location unknown.

36:13.255 --> 36:16.257
Nyla Harper, detective.

36:16.258 --> 36:19.010
Now, I told you,
I'm a happily married man.

36:19.011 --> 36:21.929
Yes, you did,
but that was a lie,

36:21.930 --> 36:25.057
just like everything else
you have told me was a lie.

36:25.058 --> 36:26.225
See, I know you're used

36:26.226 --> 36:28.019
to being the smartest guy
in the room.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.021
And, honestly,
you have mostly been right.

36:30.022 --> 36:33.024
You have played this thing
perfectly so far.

36:33.025 --> 36:36.068
Oh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.361
Oh, you don't have
to pretend.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.779
I'm not wearing a wire.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.449
I'm not here
to trick you into confessing

36:41.450 --> 36:42.950
or threaten you

36:42.951 --> 36:45.202
that Ryan Dearbourne
has flipped on you.

36:45.203 --> 36:49.040
Like I said,
you're smarter than that.

36:49.041 --> 36:53.210
But I also know that you
can't help what you are.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.339
You'll be disciplined
for a while,

36:56.340 --> 37:00.009
but then you won't be able
to stop yourself.

37:00.010 --> 37:03.095
And you will take
another victim.

37:03.096 --> 37:06.015
And we will be there.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.975
"We"?

37:07.976 --> 37:10.394
My friends on patrol,

37:10.395 --> 37:13.147
who will make driving
by your home and work

37:13.148 --> 37:14.357
part of every shift.

37:14.358 --> 37:16.525
And my other friends...

37:16.526 --> 37:20.529
My undercover friends,
who will always be out there,

37:20.530 --> 37:24.200
only you won't know who,
and you won't know when.

37:24.201 --> 37:26.160
You see, you've gotten away
with everything

37:26.161 --> 37:27.536
because you moved
in the shadows.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.997
But now you are
in the spotlight.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.540
And you will stay there

37:31.541 --> 37:35.294
until I find a way to hang
these murders around your neck

37:35.295 --> 37:38.339
and lock you away forever.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.069
I'm back.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.446
I believe
I only asked for a drink.

38:02.447 --> 38:06.117
Yes, I have that right here.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.326
Don't open it right away.
I dropped it.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.578
Mm-hmm.
And--and the rest of all this?

38:09.579 --> 38:11.038
Oh, this isn't from me.

38:11.039 --> 38:14.458
No, I definitely did not
impulse-buy half the gift shop.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.460
Ah, it must have been
my secret lover.

38:16.461 --> 38:19.088
Yeah, and if you ask me,
that guy is really needy.

38:19.089 --> 38:20.589
Well, maybe he's just worried

38:20.590 --> 38:25.094
because I'm completely
in love with you.

38:25.095 --> 38:28.180
To be honest, I've never been
more scared in my life.

38:28.181 --> 38:30.434
Me too.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.480
Jason has been a part
of my life for so long.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.316
Even when he was in prison,

38:39.317 --> 38:42.611
there was always this part
of me that was worried--

38:42.612 --> 38:46.532
what he was planning,
when would he strike?

38:46.533 --> 38:48.200
A-and now--

38:48.201 --> 38:50.579
And now you don't have
to worry anymore.

38:54.166 --> 38:57.418
Now, is there
anything else you want?

38:57.419 --> 38:59.462
I just want to go home.

38:59.463 --> 39:03.466
I will go see if I can help
Luna with that paperwork.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.384
Hang tight.
- Yeah.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.304
<i>♪ Mama said
I will always be ♪</i>

39:11.516 --> 39:14.268
<i>♪ Faith is stronger,
my love is weak ♪</i>

39:14.269 --> 39:16.854
Hey, I guess you missed
your 8:00 Zoom date.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.523
Yeah. It's all right.
Camilla gets it.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.401
- Mm. When is she moving out?
- I don't know.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.403
It's kind of hard
to picture her here, you know?

39:24.404 --> 39:27.406
The life we were planning
together was very Texas.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.408
Mm, 5,000-square-foot house

39:29.409 --> 39:31.202
for half of what I pay
for rent?

39:31.203 --> 39:34.205
Exactly--marriage,
three kids, the whole thing.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.540
- And now?
- I don't know.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.376
I've changed a lot since
I've been here, you know?

39:41.338 --> 39:42.421
And speak of the devil.

39:42.422 --> 39:44.340
Hey, I'm--I'm gonna take
this here

39:44.341 --> 39:46.217
so I don't lose her
in the elevator.

39:46.218 --> 39:48.302
Oh, yeah. No worries.
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.553
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.555
Hey, beautiful.
You're up late.

39:51.556 --> 39:52.973
<i>Yeah, I know,</i>

39:52.974 --> 39:55.351
<i>but it's the only flight
that I could get.</i>

39:55.352 --> 39:56.560
"Flight"?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.729
Wait, what?
Where are you?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.272
Surprise!

40:00.273 --> 40:02.566
Hey, what are you doing here?

40:02.567 --> 40:04.735
Oh, baby, I couldn't wait!
I quit my job!

40:04.736 --> 40:06.403
I'm moving to Los Angeles!

40:06.404 --> 40:09.532
- Oh, all right.
- Come here!

40:09.533 --> 40:12.284
So I've been thinking
about the Seth situation.

40:12.285 --> 40:14.245
It's been a long day.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.247
I know this is my problem.
I'm the TO.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.457
So I made a decision.
He can't stay.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.251
The stakes are way too high,

40:20.252 --> 40:23.129
and the only way to fix this
is to cut him from the program.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.214
Okay.
Let's talk to Grey.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.927
Wait, you're not gonna
talk me out of it?

40:29.928 --> 40:33.472
No, it's your call.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.933
Just know this whole station
is going to be behind you

40:35.934 --> 40:37.560
every step of the way.
- Thank you, sir.

40:37.561 --> 40:39.186
What's--what's going on?

40:39.187 --> 40:42.649
It's your news to share.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.361
I finally got my lab results,
and my cancer is back,

40:47.362 --> 40:49.238
but we caught it early,
and the doctor says

40:49.239 --> 40:50.781
that I should still be able
to work.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.491
And, uh, I just--I just--

40:52.492 --> 40:54.618
I wanted to let you know
that I am ready,

40:54.619 --> 40:58.414
I am willing, and able
to complete my training,

40:58.415 --> 41:00.207
if you will still have me.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.379
Yeah, of course.

41:07.215 --> 41:10.467
- I am gonna sleep for a week.
- Yes, you always say that.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.469
And then you always pick up
three new hobbies

41:12.470 --> 41:13.470
with your time off.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.389
- This is different.
- Mm-hmm.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.725
Oh, uh, I left my jacket.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.603
I'll grab it.
Hang on.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.736
There we go.

41:33.783 --> 41:36.493
- Did you find it?
- Yeah.

41:46.046 --> 41:48.797
Oh, Bailey.

41:48.798 --> 41:50.592
What did you do?

42:26.962 --> 42:27.671
<i>Damn it.</i>
