35:49.708 --> 35:51.083
[Titus] All right.

35:51.083 --> 35:54.125
Today, we begin the preparation
for our defense.

35:54.125 --> 35:57.291
<i>We start by moving the grain
into the village,</i>

35:57.291 --> 36:01.791
<i>so that they can't shoot us from orbit
without risking its destruction.</i>

36:05.791 --> 36:08.333
<i>Now the weapons
left behind by the Imperium</i>

36:08.333 --> 36:10.375
<i>will help us hold our ground.</i>

36:10.375 --> 36:12.541
[Aris] Armor-piercing
high-explosive detonators.

36:13.541 --> 36:15.625
- We've got some comms.
- [Kora] Good.

36:17.458 --> 36:20.291
The blood won't come out easy,
but we can try.

36:20.916 --> 36:23.833
No, it's perfect. Leave it.
Do we have more?

36:24.541 --> 36:25.458
[Gunnar] Sure.

36:27.291 --> 36:30.083
[Titus] <i>Gather and account
for every hunting rifle.</i>

36:31.000 --> 36:32.208
<i>Every knife.</i>

36:32.875 --> 36:35.375
<i>Every round of ammunition in the village.</i>

36:38.625 --> 36:40.625
[uplifting music plays]

36:50.916 --> 36:54.916
<i>We'll need to dig defensive positions

36:54.916 --> 36:56.750
All right.

37:01.791 --> 37:03.583
Astrid. Let's see what you got.

37:03.583 --> 37:04.708
[Astrid] Mmm-hmm.

37:06.083 --> 37:07.000
Wait.

37:10.416 --> 37:11.333
Tuck your elbow.

37:12.208 --> 37:13.041
Keep both eyes open.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.208
[gun powers up]

37:17.541 --> 37:22.416
[Tarak] Okay. Today we're going to learn
the basics of attack and defense.

37:22.416 --> 37:25.000
We have turned your harvesting tools
into weapons.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.333
- So, what we're going to try and do is...
- [bolo blade slashes]

37:28.416 --> 37:29.250
that.

37:29.958 --> 37:30.875
Yeah.

- Really good.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.791

38:33.791 --> 38:35.291
[Hagen] That's Kora's dropship.

38:36.416 --> 38:38.625
She was in bad shape
when I dragged her out.

38:39.750 --> 38:40.875
How long has it been here?

38:40.875 --> 38:43.291
- Two seasons.
- [Den] Let's go.

- [Tarak] How many?
- [Kora] Look, you have 15 rifles--

40:29.958 --> 40:32.125
[Gunnar] But it doesn't matter
how many we have.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.125
[Kora] How many people know how to work--

40:34.125 --> 40:37.000
- [Milius] Ivar should not have a weapon.
- [Gunnar] I completely agree.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.458
We'll sharpen all the blades.

40:38.458 --> 40:39.875
We just need to figure out what--

Listen. Listen.

[conversation stops]

[Gunnar] Mmm.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.375
Now we know what each of us must do.

40:59.583 --> 41:03.875
You're all here because I want you to know
who the hell you're fighting with.

41:05.250 --> 41:08.625
Everyone must share the truth.

41:10.458 --> 41:11.625

<i>to hover above the parliament of Sarawu,</i>

<i>so the choice of whether or not to vote
for independence from the Realm</i>

41:33.333 --> 41:34.500

41:35.916 --> 41:39.541
<i>But the brave people of that world
defiantly voted for freedom,</i>

41:39.541 --> 41:43.291

to open fire on the capitol.</i>

I've, uh, never fought in a battle
like the one that's coming.

43:09.333 --> 43:12.250
But I was raised in a place
that was much like this.

43:13.541 --> 43:16.208
When the ships appeared in the sky
above my world,

43:16.208 --> 43:19.291
I looked to my tribal elders
for how we would respond.

43:20.416 --> 43:21.791
They cowered,

43:21.791 --> 43:25.625
submitting and giving them everything
because they were too scared to fight.

43:26.250 --> 43:30.125
They said, "What can we do
against the might of the Motherworld?"

Those who were too weak
or too old to work were killed.

What is your story?

49:39.416 --> 49:40.958
I am a war orphan.

49:43.916 --> 49:46.333
The discipline
of a military life suited me.

I served on a ship
very much like the King's Gaze.

49:56.500 --> 49:59.416

I believed I had found one.

50:03.458 --> 50:05.708
That is until I arrived here on Veldt.

Thank you.

I don't know what will come of all of us
by end of day tomorrow.

I can only pray
that your pasts will burden you less.

Well said. We'll drink to that.

[Titus] Good.

With all our strength in the field,

Negotiate a trade?

You think they would listen?

51:53.708 --> 51:54.541
I do.

51:55.458 --> 51:57.708
But should all go wrong, as it well may,

51:58.958 --> 52:01.458
you see to it that the dropship
is still in working order

52:01.458 --> 52:04.000
and first thing in the morning
hidden from view.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.125
I will.

[Tarak] Water.

52:13.541 --> 52:15.083
Really, Titus?

52:15.083 --> 52:17.625
And that's General Titus.

52:17.625 --> 52:19.541
- Of course.

54:20.291 --> 54:21.416
Hello, James.

54:26.125 --> 54:29.041
[Jimmy] You know, the last person
who called me that

54:29.041 --> 54:32.541
was the old commander
of the Mechanicas Militarium

54:32.541 --> 54:34.708
as he died in my arms.

54:35.708 --> 54:37.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:37.666 --> 54:40.833
It's all right. I like the way it sounds.

54:40.833 --> 54:44.500
It makes me feel
something other than hopelessness.

54:46.583 --> 54:47.500
You see...

54:48.166 --> 54:52.000
I was given memories of a world
I will never see,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.875
loyalty to a king I cannot serve

54:54.875 --> 54:59.000
and love for a child I could not save.

55:00.750 --> 55:03.375
But the sound of that name as you say it

55:03.375 --> 55:06.083
lets me feel, even in the smallest way...

55:08.375 --> 55:10.583
why I exist at all.

55:12.166 --> 55:14.375
Is that why you saved Sam?

55:15.208 --> 55:16.333
I'm not certain.

55:17.750 --> 55:21.833
I know only that the thought of her
being hurt or destroyed

55:21.833 --> 55:26.083
opened a part of me that had been closed.

55:26.958 --> 55:29.250
[ethereal music plays]

55:29.250 --> 55:31.250
You're choosing a side, James.

55:32.333 --> 55:35.625
You and I are alike,
designed to kill for them.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.833
Understand, their nightmare
is you and I fighting together.

55:41.916 --> 55:44.375
Not because we are ordered or commanded,

55:45.208 --> 55:47.375
but to defend something we love.

55:53.583 --> 55:56.250
You must know you cannot win.

57:07.875 --> 57:09.500
[Cassius] These are the new formations.

57:11.500 --> 57:12.625
It's the grain.

57:14.833 --> 57:17.666
Look, they piled it against a building
so we can't destroy them.

57:17.666 --> 57:22.541
And there and there, they've stacked it
as cover to shoot from.

57:22.541 --> 57:23.750
[Cassius] Clever.

57:23.750 --> 57:25.208
[Noble] Hmm.

57:25.208 --> 57:27.208
Certainly not the plans of a farmer.

It seems General Titus hasn't

No doubt they're women and children.

57:42.291 --> 57:46.541
Hmm. Good. We'll do our best to forestall
a pitched battle in the village.

57:47.750 --> 57:49.958
While I negotiate,
we'll dispatch the Krypteia

57:49.958 --> 57:51.666
to capture the women and children.

57:52.541 --> 57:54.500
We'll land a small contingent of armor.

57:55.208 --> 57:58.583
We won't need it when they see blades
at the throat of their most vulnerable.

57:59.916 --> 58:02.250
Then we'll see
how motivated they are to fight.

Where's my warm embrace? [scoffs]

01:01:35.833 --> 01:01:38.000
I was never given that cup of ale,
you know.

01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:40.333
Arthelais.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.666
Tell me what we're trying to achieve here.

01:01:44.666 --> 01:01:46.791
The same thing as the last time we met.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:48.791
I kill you.

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:51.166
Yes.

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.625
What an honor it was.

01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:02.708
A scar. From the Scargiver herself.

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:05.041
[Kora] No blood
need be spilled here today.

01:02:05.041 --> 01:02:07.666
I will offer you one chance
to avoid slaughter.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.833
You do understand
what the Regent Balisarius will give me

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:12.875
when I bring you to your knees before him?

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:15.791
A seat in the Senate is what you seek,
I would imagine.

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:17.583
It's what I deserve.

01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:19.708
If so, take the grain you need
to feed your men

01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:21.625
on your voyage back to the Motherworld.

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:23.750
No more and no less.

01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:26.125
You leave the villagers unharmed.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:29.458
Report to Balisarius that the warriors
you sought evaded capture.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.291
And I should take nothing, yes?

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.083
Nothing at all?

01:02:34.666 --> 01:02:35.958
You take your lives.

01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:38.125
This is your choice.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.500
Disgrace and relegation,
or your head cleaved from your shoulders.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.250
Your ship serving as your tomb.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.583
Your families
and all of the Motherworld to know

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:50.750
that you were slaughtered
by the peasants of Veldt.

01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:54.541
I've been tasked
with bringing honor to the Motherworld.

01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:58.250
I intend to see
that task through to its end.

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:01.375
What amuses me most about all of this?

01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:05.458
You think you have any power
with which to negotiate? You do not.

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:09.875
You think I don't know
you're hiding your women and children?

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:12.916
As you stand there talking to me,
your plan is already failing.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:18.458
<i>Well, unless of course a different
arrangement could be made, perhaps.</i>

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:21.416
<i>I could take the grain you offered.</i>

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:25.958
I could do as you asked
and leave the villagers their lives.

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.791
There would be one cost
to this concession, however.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.666
And that cost is you.

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:39.541
Of course every member of your band would
be greatly treasured by the Imperium,

01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:41.833
but there is no denying
the one most sought after

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:44.416
by the Honorable Regent is you.

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:46.833
Arthelais herself.

01:03:47.416 --> 01:03:49.208
[exclaims, inhales deeply]

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:54.666
So herein lies your choice.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.833
<i>Arthelais, surrender to me.</i>

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:02.625
<i>And I'll permit the villagers to live.</i>

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.541
<i>However, if you refuse,</i>

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:09.083
<i>those this village holds most dear,</i>

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:11.666
<i>the elderly, the children,</i>

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:14.583
<i>currently sheltered up in that Longhouse,</i>

01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:17.000
<i>will be slaughtered by my men
on their way now.</i>

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:21.500
Has enough blood not been spilt
in that beautiful building already?

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:26.625
Are you truly prepared to allow
this to continue in your name?

01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:29.875
It's time, Arthelais.

01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:35.625
What?

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.625
Kora.

01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:46.625
Kora, what are you doing?

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:49.708
[Noble] I thought so.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:51.875
Why don't you say goodbye to your friend?

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.875
Your father awaits you.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:55.750
[Gunnar] Kora, look at me.

01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:59.000
Huh?

01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:01.416
- [Kora sniffles]
- What's happening, huh?

01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:05.916
[Kora, softly] I'm sorry.

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:08.958
I won't allow this place to die for me.

01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:10.958
I know what I'm doing.

01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:12.125
He's lying to you.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:14.625
