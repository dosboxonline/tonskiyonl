RUDY BAYLOR: My father
hated lawyers all his life.

00:41.066 --> 00:42.800
He wasn't a great guy,
my old man.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.236
He drank
and beat up my mother.

00:45.304 --> 00:47.104
He beat me up, too.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.157
So you might think
I became a lawyer

00:49.224 --> 00:50.891
just to piss him off,

00:50.959 --> 00:52.926
but you'd be wrong.

00:52.994 --> 00:55.029
I've wanted to be a lawyer

00:55.096 --> 00:56.730
ever since I read about
the civil rights lawyers

00:56.798 --> 00:58.432
in the fifties and sixties

00:58.500 --> 01:00.834
and the amazing uses
they found for the law.

01:00.902 --> 01:03.070
They did what a lot
of people thought

01:03.138 --> 01:04.772
was the impossible.

01:04.839 --> 01:07.341
They gave lawyers
a good name.

01:07.409 --> 01:10.044
And so I went
to law school,

01:10.111 --> 01:11.912
and it did
piss my father off,

01:11.980 --> 01:13.847
but he was pissed off
anyway.

01:13.915 --> 01:15.916
In my first year,
he got drunk one day

01:15.984 --> 01:16.984
and fell of a ladder

01:17.052 --> 01:19.320
manufactured by the company
he worked for,

01:19.388 --> 01:21.855
and he didn't know
who to sue first.

01:21.923 --> 01:24.358
Now, he died a couple
months after that.

01:24.426 --> 01:26.860
I'm empty.

01:26.928 --> 01:28.462
RUDY: Now, some
of my classmates,

01:28.530 --> 01:30.631
they knew they were going
straight from school

01:30.699 --> 01:32.300
into the top law firms,

01:32.367 --> 01:34.953
thanks mostly to their
family connections.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.220
Now, the only
connections I had

01:36.288 --> 01:38.823
were made in the places
where I tended bar for 3 years

01:38.890 --> 01:40.058
so I could pay my tuition.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.960
And while I still had plans

01:42.027 --> 01:43.594
to shine the blazing
light of justice

01:43.662 --> 01:44.662
into every dark corner,

01:44.729 --> 01:47.581
what I really needed
right now was a job,

01:47.649 --> 01:48.716
and badly,

01:48.783 --> 01:51.452
because there are too many
lawyers in Memphis.

01:52.587 --> 01:54.054
[Siren]

01:55.190 --> 01:57.692
This city's
infested with them.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.614
SECOND MAN:
I don't think so.

02:03.682 --> 02:06.617
RUDY: I can't think of
anything more embarrassing

02:06.685 --> 02:07.885
than telling people

02:07.953 --> 02:11.289
I work for a guy
like Bruiser Stone.

02:12.958 --> 02:16.994
MAN: I mean, he's a lawyer,
and they call him Bruiser.

02:17.062 --> 02:19.663
That's how desperate I am.

02:19.731 --> 02:20.698
Sure.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.666
Shut the door.

02:22.734 --> 02:25.636
BRUISER: No, not that.
Not that either.

02:25.704 --> 02:28.405
Sure.

02:28.473 --> 02:29.406
Sure.

02:29.474 --> 02:32.276
Let's make it my house.

02:32.344 --> 02:34.778
OK.

02:36.048 --> 02:38.549
I really pity
the poor FBI technician

02:38.616 --> 02:40.351
that's gonna
have to extract the data

02:40.418 --> 02:41.819
from that conversation.

02:41.887 --> 02:44.121
Live sharks in
a lawyer's office.

02:44.189 --> 02:46.123
It's a joke.
Get it?

02:46.191 --> 02:47.825
BRUISER: So, Prince,

02:47.893 --> 02:49.727
is this the law student
you were telling me about?

02:49.794 --> 02:50.962
Yes, sir.
I just finished

02:51.029 --> 02:52.796
my third year
at Memphis state.

02:52.865 --> 02:54.332
Couldn't you use him
around here?

02:54.399 --> 02:56.334
Look, I'll vouch for him.

02:56.401 --> 02:57.835
The boy needs a job.

02:57.903 --> 03:01.538
He's tended bar
at our clubs.

03:01.606 --> 03:04.708
This'll be a great place
for you to work, Rudy.

03:04.776 --> 03:06.443
This'll be...

03:06.511 --> 03:08.346
A great place
for you to work.

03:08.413 --> 03:10.915
You can see what
real lawyers do.

03:10.983 --> 03:14.185
Now, it ain't exactly
a salaried position.

03:14.253 --> 03:15.319
It isn't?

03:15.387 --> 03:19.123
I expect my associates
to pay for themselves...

03:19.191 --> 03:22.293
generate their own fees.

03:22.361 --> 03:23.727
Talk to me.

03:23.795 --> 03:26.063
How exactly
does that work?

03:26.131 --> 03:29.166
Well, Rudy,
you draw $1,000 a month,

03:29.234 --> 03:32.203
and you get to keep 1/3 of all
the fees that you generate.

03:32.271 --> 03:35.373
Now, if you can't
cover your draw

03:35.440 --> 03:37.541
at the end of each month,
you owe me the balance.

03:37.609 --> 03:39.560
Do you understand?

03:39.628 --> 03:41.328
Sounds fair to me,
Rudy.

03:41.396 --> 03:43.113
That's a hell
of a deal, really.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.249
You can make a lot
of money this way.

03:45.316 --> 03:46.316
Um...

03:46.384 --> 03:47.952
BRUISER: I'll tell you
something, Rudy.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.754
That's the only way
I operate.

03:49.821 --> 03:51.455
And I'll get you
a lot of good cases.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.291
I have cases.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.726
Uh...

03:55.794 --> 03:58.395
I have 2 cases
right now.

03:58.463 --> 04:00.097
One is a will

04:00.165 --> 04:01.498
that I'm drafting
for an old woman.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.167
She's loaded, too.
She's worth millions.

04:03.234 --> 04:05.302
And then I have
this other case.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.537
It's an insurance case.

04:06.605 --> 04:09.707
Great Benefit.
You heard of 'em.

04:09.775 --> 04:11.909
You got these clients signed?

04:11.977 --> 04:14.111
I'm on my way
to see 'em right now,

04:14.179 --> 04:15.846
and they'll listen
to me, too.

04:15.914 --> 04:17.514
I helped 'em
over at a law workshop.

04:17.583 --> 04:19.216
All right,
I'm gonna have you talk

04:19.284 --> 04:21.118
to an associate of mine,
Deck Schifflet.

04:21.185 --> 04:24.755
He used to work with these
big insurance companies.

04:24.823 --> 04:27.558
He handles all the high-powered
stuff around here.

04:27.626 --> 04:30.027
Hey, deck!

04:30.095 --> 04:31.228
Deck!

04:31.296 --> 04:32.262
Damn it.

04:32.330 --> 04:33.798
You got the paperwork
on this stuff?

04:33.865 --> 04:34.765
In my car.

04:34.833 --> 04:35.866
Good.

04:35.934 --> 04:37.068
[Door Opens]

04:39.304 --> 04:41.772
BRUISER: Hey, good lookin'

04:41.840 --> 04:44.475
this is Deck Schifflet.

04:44.542 --> 04:47.044
This man will get you
plugged in.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.646
What I want you to do,

04:48.714 --> 04:51.398
I want you to draw up a lawsuit
against this Great Benefit,

04:51.466 --> 04:54.202
and you put my name on it.

04:54.269 --> 04:55.970
We're gonna file it today.

04:56.038 --> 04:57.371
Thank you.

04:57.439 --> 04:59.506
Rudy, you're gonna
learn a lot.

04:59.574 --> 05:02.110
Rudy, I'm glad
you came here.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.112
You're making good
choices already, son.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.346
All right,
well, thank you.

05:05.413 --> 05:06.914
OK, thank you.

05:06.982 --> 05:08.616
Close the door on your
way out now, OK?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.117
WOMAN: Law offices.
May I help you?

05:10.185 --> 05:11.551
This is an office,
there's people in it.

05:11.619 --> 05:12.920
If there's somebody
in the office,

05:12.988 --> 05:14.321
you can't have it,
it's off limits.

05:14.389 --> 05:15.789
This is the bathroom.

05:15.857 --> 05:16.790
WOMAN:
Just a minute.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.425
Sorry.

05:18.493 --> 05:20.160
So, are you
an associate here?

05:20.228 --> 05:21.762
Sort of. Not really.

05:21.829 --> 05:23.230
I'm actually
not a lawyer yet.

05:23.298 --> 05:25.565
Bruiser usually asks me

05:25.633 --> 05:27.401
to review the insurance cases
when they come in.

05:27.468 --> 05:29.836
I used to work for specific
mutual insurance company.

05:29.905 --> 05:31.538
I got sick of that.
I went to law school.

05:31.606 --> 05:33.941
Well, when did you
finish law school?

05:34.009 --> 05:35.209
5 years ago.

05:35.277 --> 05:36.476
See, I'm having
a little trouble

05:36.544 --> 05:37.711
with the bar exam.

05:37.779 --> 05:39.813
I sat for it 6 times.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.814
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:40.882 --> 05:41.848
Yeah. When do you
take yours?

05:41.917 --> 05:42.849
I take it
in, like, 3 weeks.

05:42.918 --> 05:43.850
Oh, yeah.

05:43.919 --> 05:44.885
It's that hard?

05:44.953 --> 05:46.287
Pretty rough,
I'll say.

05:46.354 --> 05:47.554
I took it a year ago.

05:47.622 --> 05:49.123
I don't think I'm gonna
take it again.

05:49.190 --> 05:51.058
Anyway, this is
Bruiser's law library.

05:51.126 --> 05:52.293
If you want
to get anything

05:52.360 --> 05:54.295
out of the fridge
or use the fridge,

05:54.362 --> 05:56.230
you can put
your name on stuff.

05:56.298 --> 05:58.933
They'll eat it anyway.
Put that in for me.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.667
Aw, it's only rice.
What the hell. Daisy.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.668
DAISY: Yeah.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.470
We made a mess here.
Get that up, huh?

06:03.538 --> 06:04.471
Sure, deck.

06:04.539 --> 06:05.705
Anyway...

06:05.773 --> 06:07.908
So wait, what happens
when you have to go to court?

06:07.976 --> 06:10.144
I've actually gone
a few times myself.

06:10.211 --> 06:11.178
I haven't
gotten caught.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.346
There's so many
lawyers here,

06:12.414 --> 06:14.815
it's impossible
to keep up with us.

06:16.451 --> 06:18.319
Bruiser owns all this.

06:18.386 --> 06:20.054
Oh. Nice.

06:20.121 --> 06:22.389
You can't call it
a firm exactly.

06:22.457 --> 06:24.458
It's every man
for himself.

06:24.525 --> 06:25.926
You'll learn.

06:28.363 --> 06:30.264
What, are you moving?

06:30.332 --> 06:31.932
Evicted.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.535
Here's the policy.

06:37.538 --> 06:38.505
Yeah.

06:38.573 --> 06:39.573
What do you think?

06:39.640 --> 06:42.009
Well, this is
the scratch-and-sniff armpit

06:42.077 --> 06:43.143
of the industry.

06:43.211 --> 06:44.979
What are their grounds
for denial?

06:45.046 --> 06:46.046
Oh, well, everything.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.983
They first denied it
just on principle,

06:49.050 --> 06:52.052
and then they said
that leukemia

06:52.120 --> 06:53.187
was a pre-existing
condition,

06:53.254 --> 06:54.188
and then they said

06:54.255 --> 06:56.023
leukemia wasn't covered
in the policy.

06:56.091 --> 06:57.391
I got 7 letters here.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.460
Have all the premiums
been paid?

06:59.527 --> 07:00.527
According to Miss Black,

07:00.595 --> 07:01.996
she paid every
single one of them.

07:02.063 --> 07:03.597
The bastards.

07:03.664 --> 07:07.434
This is a typical
debit insurance scam.

07:07.502 --> 07:09.903
The Blacks call it
street-surance.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.739
So what do I do?

07:12.807 --> 07:16.110
You sign 'em up.
Sign 'em all up.

07:16.177 --> 07:18.379
To J. Lyman Stone.

07:18.446 --> 07:20.014
All right.

07:20.081 --> 07:22.099
Yeah. I'll help you
on this one.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.333
All right.
Well, thank you.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.434
I appreciate it.

07:24.502 --> 07:26.103
There's nothing
more thrilling

07:26.171 --> 07:29.306
than nailing
an insurance company.

07:30.108 --> 07:32.276
[Dog Barking]

07:46.591 --> 07:49.327
Hi, Ms. Black.
It's Rudy Baylor.

07:49.394 --> 07:51.929
Remember?
I'm handling your case

07:51.997 --> 07:53.097
against Great Benefit.

07:53.165 --> 07:54.131
I met you

07:54.199 --> 07:56.801
over at the Memphis
state law workshop.

07:56.868 --> 07:58.101
Well, come in.

07:58.169 --> 08:01.605
Come in. I'm sorry
about them crazy dogs.

08:01.673 --> 08:02.973
Oh, that's OK.

08:03.041 --> 08:05.075
I thought you was
a Jehovah's witness.

08:05.143 --> 08:06.076
RUDY: Where's Buddy?

08:06.144 --> 08:07.812
He's out in the car.

08:07.879 --> 08:10.180
Where's he going?

08:10.248 --> 08:12.282
Buddy isn't going
nowhere.

08:12.351 --> 08:14.084
He ain't right
in the head. War injury.

08:14.152 --> 08:17.054
Korea. You know
them metal detectors

08:17.121 --> 08:18.288
at the airport?

08:18.357 --> 08:20.290
He can walk through one
buck naked,

08:20.359 --> 08:21.592
and the thing
would go off.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.894
He's got a plate
in his head.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.696
Oh.

08:25.764 --> 08:28.165
That's awful.

08:30.017 --> 08:32.018
How's Donny Ray?

08:32.086 --> 08:34.020
Well, good days and bad.

08:34.087 --> 08:34.988
"Plate in head."

08:35.056 --> 08:36.789
You want to meet him?

08:36.857 --> 08:38.275
Maybe later.

08:38.342 --> 08:39.943
Um, now...

08:42.381 --> 08:47.551
Great Benefit first denied
your claim last August

08:47.619 --> 08:50.021
when Donny Ray was diagnosed.

08:50.088 --> 08:52.990
Why'd y'all wait till now
to consult a lawyer?

08:53.058 --> 08:55.159
Stupid, I guess.

08:55.227 --> 08:56.660
I just kept
writing 'em,

08:56.728 --> 08:58.629
and they kept
writing me back,

08:58.696 --> 09:01.198
and this here
is the latest one.

09:03.535 --> 09:04.968
"Dear Mrs. Black,

09:05.037 --> 09:06.270
"on 7 prior occasions

09:06.338 --> 09:08.305
"this company had denied
your claim in writing.

09:08.373 --> 09:11.208
"We now deny it for the eighth
and final time.

09:11.276 --> 09:14.978
You must be stupid,
stupid, stupid."

09:16.248 --> 09:23.054
"Sincerely, Everett Lufkin,
Vice President of Claims."

09:24.589 --> 09:26.657
RUDY: I don't
believe this.

09:26.724 --> 09:28.892
DONNY RAY: You're the lawyer.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.764
Mom says
nice things about you.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.801
She says you're suing
those bastards

09:37.869 --> 09:39.970
over at Great Benefit.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.039
Gonna make 'em pay, huh?

09:42.107 --> 09:43.140
That's right.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.076
That's right.

09:45.143 --> 09:46.777
Hi, mama.

09:46.844 --> 09:48.011
Hi, honey.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.065
Well, before we can
file a claim,

09:51.132 --> 09:53.333
I need all 3 of you
to sign this.

09:53.401 --> 09:55.569
Is daddy coming in?

09:55.636 --> 09:58.038
Well, he said
he wasn't.

09:58.106 --> 09:59.606
Some days
he comes in,

09:59.674 --> 10:00.774
and some days
he don't.

10:00.842 --> 10:02.009
Well, this is a contract.

10:02.077 --> 10:03.844
What's in it?

10:03.912 --> 10:05.579
Oh, the usual.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.247
It's standard language.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.415
It basically says

10:08.482 --> 10:11.051
that y'all hire us
to be your attorneys,

10:11.119 --> 10:12.920
and we take care
of the case for you.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.555
We handle any expenses
that we might have,

10:15.623 --> 10:17.891
and then we get
1/3 of any recovery.

10:17.959 --> 10:19.460
Mm-hmm.

10:19.527 --> 10:23.397
Well, why does it take
2 pages to say all that?

10:23.465 --> 10:25.031
Don't light that.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.736
No wonder I'm dying.

10:30.104 --> 10:32.873
And all 3 of us
have to sign it?

10:32.941 --> 10:35.008
Yes, ma'am, all 3.
Just where your name is.

10:35.076 --> 10:37.077
He said he wasn't
coming in.

10:37.145 --> 10:38.712
Take the pen
and go out there

10:38.780 --> 10:40.380
and make him sign
the damn thing.

10:40.448 --> 10:42.282
I guess I could.

10:49.390 --> 10:50.423
Now, Buddy,

10:50.759 --> 10:52.376
you gotta sign
this paper

10:52.443 --> 10:55.078
so Donny Ray can get
that operation he needs,

10:55.146 --> 10:57.481
and I don't want
no trouble out of you.

10:57.549 --> 10:59.416
I'll take
that damn bottle

10:59.484 --> 11:01.418
and throw it
across union street.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.522
Now sign the damn thing.
Come on, hurry up.

11:04.589 --> 11:06.289
[Cats Meow]

11:06.357 --> 11:09.326
I know you must think
they're crazy.

11:10.829 --> 11:12.897
They're nice folks.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.403
Hey, man.

11:21.606 --> 11:23.891
Hey, your nose
is bleeding.

11:26.044 --> 11:27.811
Mrs. Black!

11:27.879 --> 11:29.146
Hold your head up.

11:29.213 --> 11:31.298
Mrs. Black!

11:31.365 --> 11:33.033
It's OK.
I got it.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.334
He's bleeding.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.303
Put your head back.
Put your head back.

11:36.370 --> 11:37.971
Come on,
put it back.

11:38.039 --> 11:40.474
Oh, sweetie, OK,
it'll be all right.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.276
I got it.

11:43.344 --> 11:44.611
I got it.

11:46.013 --> 11:47.481
OK, OK.

11:47.549 --> 11:49.082
OK, I got it.

11:49.150 --> 11:51.485
You're gonna
be all right.

11:51.553 --> 11:52.820
Where's the paper?

11:52.887 --> 11:54.521
Donny Ray, why don't you
just rest a little bit?

11:54.589 --> 11:55.589
You can wait.

11:55.657 --> 11:56.557
You don't have
to do this now.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.224
No, no. I want
to do this now.

11:58.292 --> 11:59.493
OK.

12:00.495 --> 12:03.263
All right, all right,
you can do it.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.598
Go ahead.

12:04.666 --> 12:06.667
You're doing it.

12:17.012 --> 12:20.447
Uh, Miss Birdie,
it's Rudy Baylor.

12:21.649 --> 12:23.083
What?

12:23.151 --> 12:24.584
Who is it?

12:26.020 --> 12:27.888
It's Rudy Baylor.

12:27.956 --> 12:28.956
Oh.

12:29.023 --> 12:30.423
We met
at the law workshop

12:30.492 --> 12:31.458
at Memphis state.

12:31.526 --> 12:34.394
Oh, yes.
Oh, come in, come in.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.463
Thank you, thank you.

12:36.531 --> 12:37.664
How are you doing today?

12:37.732 --> 12:38.832
Fine, fine.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.968
Miss Birdie, I wanted
to talk to you

12:41.035 --> 12:42.119
about your will.

12:42.186 --> 12:44.321
Cut my children out of
my will. Cut, cut, cut.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.723
Cut, cut, cut.
I know.

12:45.790 --> 12:46.990
I had trouble sleeping
last night

12:47.058 --> 12:49.025
'cause I was worried
about your estate.

12:49.093 --> 12:51.928
Now, if you're not careful,
Miss Birdie,

12:51.996 --> 12:54.598
the government is just gonna
get a big chunk of this.

12:54.666 --> 12:57.200
Now, a lot of these taxes
can be avoided

12:57.269 --> 12:59.970
with a little bit
of careful estate planning.

13:00.037 --> 13:02.205
Oh, that legal
gobbledygook.

13:02.274 --> 13:04.174
I suppose
you want your name

13:04.242 --> 13:05.743
in the will
somewhere.

13:05.810 --> 13:07.010
Of course not.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.912
Lawyers are always
wanting their names

13:08.980 --> 13:10.080
in my wills.

13:10.148 --> 13:12.983
No, ma'am. Well, there are
all kinds of lawyers.

13:13.050 --> 13:15.686
What I do need from you is,
for purposes of estate planning,

13:15.754 --> 13:17.821
I do need to know
where the money is.

13:17.889 --> 13:21.558
Is it in bonds
or stocks or cash?

13:21.626 --> 13:25.095
Now, Rudy, not so fast,
not so fast.

13:25.163 --> 13:31.134
OK, ma'am. So we have
this money somewhere.

13:31.202 --> 13:33.304
Who are we gonna
leave it to?

13:33.371 --> 13:34.338
Well,

13:34.406 --> 13:36.239
I want it all to go

13:36.308 --> 13:37.741
to the reverend
Kenneth Chandler.

13:37.809 --> 13:38.742
Do you know him?

13:38.810 --> 13:40.977
He's on television
all the time now

13:41.045 --> 13:42.245
out of Dallas.

13:42.314 --> 13:44.581
Got this curly
gray hair premature,

13:44.649 --> 13:45.716
and he wouldn't
dream

13:45.784 --> 13:47.083
of touching it up,
you know?

13:47.151 --> 13:50.020
I want him
to have the money.

13:50.087 --> 13:53.357
Forgive me,
Miss Birdie. Um...

13:53.425 --> 13:55.125
What?

13:55.193 --> 13:57.494
I just have a real problem

13:57.562 --> 14:00.764
drafting a will
or any instrument

14:00.832 --> 14:04.034
that's gonna cut out family

14:04.101 --> 14:06.002
and that's gonna replace it

14:06.070 --> 14:08.706
and convey
the bulk of this estate

14:08.773 --> 14:11.942
to a TV personality.

14:13.611 --> 14:16.046
Well, he's a man of God.

14:16.113 --> 14:17.648
I realize that.

14:17.716 --> 14:18.882
I know.

14:18.950 --> 14:22.753
Is there any way we could
attack this in more of a...

14:22.821 --> 14:24.521
do you have to give him
everything?

14:24.589 --> 14:28.124
Could it be more,
say, 25%

14:28.192 --> 14:30.461
he's got
a lot of overhead,

14:30.528 --> 14:32.496
and his jet
is getting old.

14:32.564 --> 14:33.997
His jet is getting old?

14:34.065 --> 14:35.666
Now, Rudy, I want you
to just please

14:35.734 --> 14:37.067
draw it up
the way I ask

14:37.134 --> 14:38.168
and bring it back to me

14:38.236 --> 14:40.871
so I can review it,
all right?

14:40.938 --> 14:42.172
Here's the hustlers

14:42.240 --> 14:44.508
when they were still
young and sweet.

14:44.576 --> 14:46.209
Cut, cut, cut.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.515
You come back now, huh?

14:52.583 --> 14:55.018
Oh, I will, I will.

14:55.086 --> 14:56.653
Thank you.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.188
No. Thank you.

14:59.224 --> 15:02.425
Is that a little
apartment back there?

15:02.493 --> 15:03.794
Used to be.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.195
What do you think
about my garden?

15:05.263 --> 15:07.497
Oh, that's
a fine-looking garden.

15:07.565 --> 15:09.166
Do you do all the work
on this yourself?

15:09.234 --> 15:10.600
Most of it.

15:10.668 --> 15:13.036
I pay a young boy to cut
the grass for me once a week.

15:13.104 --> 15:15.105
$30. Can you believe it?

15:15.173 --> 15:17.474
Used to be 5.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.109
Well, I don't suppose
you'd be interested

15:19.177 --> 15:20.778
in renting this place
out now, would you?

15:20.845 --> 15:22.612
I couldn't afford much,
though.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.548
I could let you have it
quite reasonably

15:25.616 --> 15:27.651
if you'd assist me with a few
chores around the place.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.153
Sure, sure.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.022
Perhaps a little weed pulling
now and then.

15:32.090 --> 15:35.242
Sure. Weed pulling's
my specialty.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.346
Go to hospitals
all the time.

15:39.414 --> 15:42.015
Bruiser has contacts
down at the main precinct,

15:42.083 --> 15:43.183
guys he grew up with.

15:43.251 --> 15:45.419
They feed him accident
reports every morning.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.886
Can I ask you
something?

15:46.954 --> 15:47.954
Sure.

15:48.022 --> 15:51.391
What does Bruiser
expect me to do?

15:51.459 --> 15:53.193
Get the case.
You find the victims.

15:53.261 --> 15:56.096
You sign 'em up to the law firm
of J. Lyman Stone.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.464
Put the case together.

15:57.532 --> 15:59.499
So I should solicit?

15:59.567 --> 16:01.535
What did they teach you
in law school?

16:01.602 --> 16:02.735
Well, they didn't
teach me

16:02.803 --> 16:04.003
how to chase
ambulances.

16:04.072 --> 16:06.106
Well, you better learn quick,
or you're gonna starve.

16:11.112 --> 16:13.280
All you have to do
is ask for a doctor

16:13.347 --> 16:15.715
and we can admit you
right here. Sure.

16:15.783 --> 16:16.916
Nice flowers.

16:16.984 --> 16:18.318
Thanks.

16:18.386 --> 16:19.453
William.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.454
How you doing, deck?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.622
All right. 346.

16:24.858 --> 16:25.825
Dr. Wells.

16:25.893 --> 16:26.859
Morning.

16:26.927 --> 16:29.096
How are you?
Good to see you.

16:29.163 --> 16:31.798
Don't act
like a lawyer.

16:36.971 --> 16:39.472
Hmm. "Do not enter."

16:44.345 --> 16:46.546
How you doing,
Mr. McKenzie?

16:46.614 --> 16:49.783
How are my tests?

16:50.785 --> 16:54.704
Gall bladder.
Wrong fish.

16:54.772 --> 16:57.140
Mr. Van Landel.

16:57.208 --> 17:00.010
Good afternoon,
Mr. Van Landel.

17:01.712 --> 17:04.748
Can you hear me,
Mr. Van Landel?

17:04.815 --> 17:05.915
Hi.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.351
Who are you?

17:07.417 --> 17:09.219
I'm Deck Schifflet,
para-lawyer.

17:09.287 --> 17:10.354
You haven't talked

17:10.421 --> 17:11.755
to any insurance
companies, have you?

17:11.821 --> 17:12.756
No.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.191
Good. don't talk to 'em

17:14.259 --> 17:15.308
because they're just
out to screw you.

17:15.376 --> 17:16.342
Do you have a lawyer?

17:16.810 --> 17:17.594
No.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.063
My firm
handles more car wrecks

17:20.131 --> 17:21.431
than anybody in Memphis.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.001
Insurance companies
are terrified of us,

17:24.068 --> 17:26.236
and we don't
charge a dime.

17:26.304 --> 17:28.105
Can you wait
till my wife gets back?

17:28.172 --> 17:29.239
Your wife, Mr. van...

17:29.307 --> 17:30.307
Ow!

17:30.375 --> 17:32.642
Aah!

17:32.710 --> 17:34.278
Sorry.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.413
I'm very sorry,
Mr. Van Landel.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.848
Very sorry.

17:38.049 --> 17:40.384
Where is your wife,
Mr. Van Landel?

17:40.451 --> 17:42.619
She'll be back
in a little while.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.653
Well, I'm gonna
have to talk to her

17:43.721 --> 17:44.888
down in my office

17:44.956 --> 17:47.224
because there's a ton of
information that I need.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.491
Just sign right there.

17:48.559 --> 17:50.260
Remember,
don't talk to anybody

17:50.328 --> 17:51.428
except your doctor.

17:51.495 --> 17:52.963
There are gonna be
people coming at you

17:53.031 --> 17:53.964
from every direction

17:54.032 --> 17:55.566
offering you
settlements.

17:55.633 --> 17:58.068
I do not want you
under any circumstances

17:58.135 --> 18:00.236
to sign anything without
me reviewing it first.

18:00.304 --> 18:02.105
Understand? My number
is on this card.

18:02.173 --> 18:04.007
You can call me
24 hours a day.

18:04.075 --> 18:06.376
Mr. Rudy Baylor's number
is on the back.

18:06.444 --> 18:09.446
You can call that number
for him any time, OK?

18:09.513 --> 18:10.480
Do you have
any questions?

18:10.548 --> 18:11.582
No.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.517
Good. We're gonna get
you a bunch of money.

18:14.586 --> 18:16.152
Let's go.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.921
I'm real sorry
about your leg.

18:18.122 --> 18:22.559
I'd like to be alone please.

18:25.129 --> 18:26.830
And that
is how it's done.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.665
Piece of cake.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.234
What if the guy
had a lawyer?

18:31.302 --> 18:33.337
We came with nothing.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.804
If he'd have thrown us
out of his room

18:34.872 --> 18:37.107
for whatever reason,
what have we lost?

18:37.175 --> 18:38.608
A little dignity.

Maybe a little self-respect.

18:41.112 --> 18:43.746
You see...

18:43.814 --> 18:45.082
In law school, Rudy,

18:45.149 --> 18:46.649
they don't teach you
what you need to know.

18:46.717 --> 18:48.885
It's all theories
and lofty notions

18:48.953 --> 18:51.154
and big fat
ethics books.

18:51.222 --> 18:52.555
What's wrong with ethics?

18:52.623 --> 18:55.092
Nothing, I guess.

18:55.159 --> 18:57.861
I mean,
I believe a lawyer

18:57.928 --> 18:59.096
should fight
for his client,

18:59.163 --> 19:00.230
refrain from
stealing money.

19:00.298 --> 19:01.398
And try not to lie.

You know,
the basics.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.934
That was blatant
ambulance chasing.

19:05.003 --> 19:06.303
Right, but who cares?

19:06.371 --> 19:07.871
There's a lot of lawyers
out there.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.240
It's a marketplace.
It's a competition.

19:10.308 --> 19:13.710

in law school can get you hurt.

19:19.850 --> 19:24.654
What's the difference between
a hooker and a lawyer?

19:24.722 --> 19:28.458
A hooker will stop screwing you
after you're dead.

19:28.526 --> 19:31.861
Everybody loves
lawyer jokes,

19:31.929 --> 19:33.063

They're even
sort of proud of 'em.

19:35.766 --> 19:38.902
Why do you suppose that is?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.004
A third party
is no different.

I... I am prepared
to argue this motion.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.349
Are you a lawyer?

42:40.417 --> 42:42.684
Well, I just
passed the bar,

42:42.752 --> 42:44.819
and, uh, these
are my clients.

42:44.887 --> 42:46.888
Mr. Stone filed this
on my behalf

42:46.956 --> 42:48.390
until I passed the bar.

42:48.458 --> 42:50.659
Well, you got a hell
of a lot of nerve

42:50.727 --> 42:52.628
walking into my courtroom
without a license.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.463
Now get the hell out of here,
get your license,

42:54.531 --> 42:55.864
and then you come back.

42:55.932 --> 42:57.399
Get a license!

42:57.467 --> 42:59.468
Come back when you
got a damn license!

42:59.536 --> 43:01.670
May it
please the court...

43:02.739 --> 43:05.974
For the record, my name
is Leo F. Drummond

43:06.042 --> 43:07.810
of Tinley-Brit,

43:07.877 --> 43:09.277
counsel
for Great Benefit,

43:09.345 --> 43:10.779
and I say

43:10.847 --> 43:14.349
if this young man
has passed the bar exam,

43:14.417 --> 43:17.118
your honor, let him
argue the case.

43:17.186 --> 43:21.222
We welcome him to, uh,
big-time litigation.

43:21.290 --> 43:23.892
You have no objection,
Mr. Drummond?

43:23.960 --> 43:25.928
DRUMMOND:
If it please the court,

43:25.995 --> 43:28.630
I would be honored
to introduce Mr. Baylor

43:28.698 --> 43:30.031
to the practice of law

43:30.099 --> 43:31.800
in the great state
of Tennessee.

43:31.868 --> 43:34.636
Judge, you can give him
the oath right now,

43:34.704 --> 43:37.573
and I'll be pleased
to stand for him.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.676
Are you certain you're prepared
to proceed, Mr. Baylor?

43:40.977 --> 43:43.528
Abso... [Feedback]

43:43.596 --> 43:46.331
Yeah. Your honor, yes.

43:46.398 --> 43:49.667
JUDGE HALE: Very well, then.
Raise your right hand.

43:49.736 --> 43:51.603
Do you solemnly swear,
Rudy Baylor,

43:51.670 --> 43:54.106
that you will support
the constitution and the laws

43:54.173 --> 43:55.874
of the United States
and the state of Tennessee

43:55.942 --> 43:57.209
faithfully and honorably,

43:57.276 --> 43:59.277
conduct yourself in the practice
of your profession

43:59.345 --> 44:02.814
to the best of your skills
and abilities, so help you God?

44:04.150 --> 44:05.617
I do.

44:05.684 --> 44:09.121
OK, fine, fine. That's it.
Let's move on. [Coughs]

44:09.188 --> 44:10.488
Congratulations.
Thank you.

44:10.556 --> 44:11.823
Welcome to the war.

44:11.891 --> 44:15.560
RUDY: Sworn in by a fool
and vouched for by a scoundrel.

44:15.628 --> 44:16.561
Harvey.

44:16.629 --> 44:18.296
I'm a lawyer at last.

44:18.364 --> 44:19.865
JUDGE HALE: Come on in.

44:24.037 --> 44:25.670
May I, Harv?

44:25.738 --> 44:27.205
Sure.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.142
Uh, sit down.

44:32.045 --> 44:33.678
Um...

44:34.914 --> 44:39.451
This lawsuit bothers me,
Mr. Baylor.

44:39.518 --> 44:41.719
I wouldn't use the word
"Frivolous,"

44:41.787 --> 44:44.489
but I'm not impressed
with the merits of it,

44:44.557 --> 44:45.790
to be Frank.

44:45.858 --> 44:48.860
DRUMMOND: Ahem. I'm gonna try
to sneak some gym time in.

44:48.928 --> 44:51.246
In fact, I'm really tired
of these type of lawsuits.

44:51.314 --> 44:52.914
Don't make no excuses.

44:54.217 --> 44:57.185
I'm inclined to grant
the motion to dismiss.

44:57.253 --> 45:02.523
Now, you can, uh, refile it
in federal court, you know,

45:02.591 --> 45:05.227
take it somewhere else.
[Coughs]

45:05.294 --> 45:08.230
I don't want it
clogging up my docket.

45:08.297 --> 45:10.598
Now, excuse me
while I go to the can.

45:10.666 --> 45:12.033
You, too.

45:15.872 --> 45:18.240
Rudy...

45:19.242 --> 45:21.709
I'm a very expensive lawyer

45:21.777 --> 45:24.079
from a very expensive firm,
and, uh...

45:24.146 --> 45:26.047
I've had a lot of cases.

45:26.115 --> 45:28.649
I can hit pretty close to
the center of the dart board,

45:28.717 --> 45:31.686
and I told my clients,
Great Benefit,

45:31.754 --> 45:35.156
that cost alone here
gonna be a big deal.

45:35.224 --> 45:38.010
And for you, too.
Your side, too.

45:38.077 --> 45:41.380
Now, they've
authorized me...

45:41.447 --> 45:45.717
To offer you
and your clients...

45:47.553 --> 45:50.755
$50,000 to settle
this thing out.

45:50.823 --> 45:54.776
And I... I may even be able
to raise that figure up

45:54.843 --> 45:59.047
as high as, uh,
maybe 75,000.

45:59.982 --> 46:03.050
No admission of liability,
you understand.

46:03.118 --> 46:05.570
Course, uh...

46:05.638 --> 46:07.005
If you say no,

46:07.073 --> 46:10.175
then it's going
to be world war III.

46:10.242 --> 46:11.777
[Chuckles]

46:12.961 --> 46:14.862
My turn now.
May I, Harv?

46:14.930 --> 46:16.698
Sure.

46:18.734 --> 46:20.101
Uh...

46:21.437 --> 46:22.504
[Door Closes]

46:22.571 --> 46:24.839
There's not much
of a lawsuit here,

46:24.907 --> 46:26.374
I'm afraid, son.

46:26.442 --> 46:29.711
But maybe I could
lean on Leo

46:29.779 --> 46:32.013
to make you an offer
of a settlement.

46:32.315 --> 46:33.965
They'll probably want
to throw some money at you

46:34.033 --> 46:36.468
to keep from paying Leo
a thousand bucks a minute.

46:36.536 --> 46:37.969
[Coughing]

46:38.037 --> 46:42.340
But he already offered me
the cost of the defense.

46:42.408 --> 46:45.310
Oh, really?
How much?

46:45.378 --> 46:48.080
Uh, 75,000.

46:48.147 --> 46:50.848
Jeez.

46:50.916 --> 46:53.017
Well, looky here, son,

46:53.086 --> 46:56.054
you'd be crazy
not to take that.

46:57.490 --> 46:58.856
You think so?

46:58.924 --> 47:01.526
75,000? Jeez.

47:01.594 --> 47:03.795
That's a...
That's a bunch of money.

47:03.862 --> 47:05.263
Doesn't sound like Leo.

47:05.331 --> 47:07.966
Well, he's a...
he's a great guy.

47:09.034 --> 47:10.768
Hmm.

47:12.288 --> 47:14.956
Whoo.

47:16.292 --> 47:17.258
So?

47:17.326 --> 47:18.726
That was not a meeting
in chambers.

47:18.794 --> 47:20.261
That was an ambush.

47:20.329 --> 47:21.229
What happened?

47:21.297 --> 47:22.663
They tag-teamed me.

47:22.731 --> 47:23.764
Yeah.

47:23.832 --> 47:25.733
Think they would have
done that to Bruiser?

47:25.801 --> 47:27.268
Nah. Bruiser's
too savvy for that.

47:27.336 --> 47:28.236
So what?

47:28.304 --> 47:29.937
They offered me
75,000.

47:30.006 --> 47:31.439
Good. Take it.

47:31.507 --> 47:33.808
Our third is 25,000.

47:33.876 --> 47:35.276
We need the money.

47:35.344 --> 47:37.278
Judge Hale is serious
about dismissing this case.

47:37.346 --> 47:38.746
He's an just
an old angry man

47:38.814 --> 47:40.248
who's been sitting
on that bench too long.

47:40.316 --> 47:42.700
The best thing we can do
is grab what we can

47:42.769 --> 47:44.469
to make things easy
on his parents.

47:45.604 --> 47:48.073
The insurance company
made an offer to settle.

47:48.141 --> 47:50.275
What kind of offer?

47:50.342 --> 47:52.811
$75,000.

47:53.946 --> 47:55.981
RUDY: They figure
that's what it's gonna cost

47:56.048 --> 47:58.016
to pay their lawyers
to defend the case.

47:58.084 --> 47:59.284
DOT: Oh.

47:59.351 --> 48:02.553
Son of a bitches think
they can just buy us off.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.723
That's exactly
what they think.

48:09.461 --> 48:11.396
You better talk to him.

48:15.734 --> 48:17.735
Do you wanna settle,
Rudy?

48:21.056 --> 48:23.408
I mean, some of the money
is yours.

48:27.913 --> 48:29.648
No way.

48:31.651 --> 48:34.419
I wanna expose
these people.

48:36.088 --> 48:39.040
Mama, could you get me
a glass of water, please?

48:39.107 --> 48:40.608
Sure, baby.

48:48.451 --> 48:50.351
Whatever you get out
of this case,

48:50.419 --> 48:52.954
take care of my family
with it.

48:55.424 --> 48:57.559
I really love them.

48:57.626 --> 48:59.561
RUDY:
I can't help thinking

48:59.628 --> 49:02.063
that while we're all out there
scrambling around for an edge

49:02.130 --> 49:04.098
like we're never gonna die,

49:04.166 --> 49:06.067
this boy's
looking right at it,

49:06.134 --> 49:08.603
and he's doing it
almost alone.

49:08.671 --> 49:10.404
I can't even begin

49:10.473 --> 49:12.757
to imagine the courage
it must take.

49:12.825 --> 49:14.809
[Telephone Rings]

49:18.681 --> 49:19.614
[Ring]

49:19.682 --> 49:20.749
Hello?

49:20.816 --> 49:23.117
DECK: Guess who died
last night.

49:23.185 --> 49:24.118
Who?

49:24.186 --> 49:25.620
Do you ever sleep?

49:25.688 --> 49:27.088
Harvey Hale.

49:27.156 --> 49:28.089
62.

49:28.157 --> 49:30.091
Quite a pedigree.

49:30.159 --> 49:31.626
Judge Hale?

49:31.694 --> 49:33.595
Yep. Croaked
with a heart attack.

49:33.663 --> 49:35.630
Dropped dead
in his swimming pool.

49:35.698 --> 49:37.131
You gotta be kidding me.

49:37.199 --> 49:38.132
Uh-uh.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.601
You gotta be kidding me.

49:39.669 --> 49:40.602
Mm-mmm.

49:40.670 --> 49:42.637
Guess what newly made judge

49:42.705 --> 49:44.639
was assigned Great Benefit
case in his place.

49:44.707 --> 49:46.641
How in the hell am I
supposed to know that?

49:46.709 --> 49:47.842
Tyrone Kipler.

49:47.910 --> 49:50.144
Black Harvard
civil-rights lawyer.

49:50.212 --> 49:52.146
He can't stand
Tinley-Brit,

49:52.214 --> 49:54.115
and he's tough
on insurance companies...

49:54.183 --> 49:55.650
sues them all the time.

49:55.718 --> 49:57.118
Great luck for us.

49:57.186 --> 49:58.620
All right, all right.

49:58.688 --> 50:00.121
You know what
a rainmaker is kid?

50:00.189 --> 50:01.656
The bucks are gonna be
falling from the sky!

50:01.724 --> 50:03.124
It's 5:00 right now.
What time you coming down?

50:03.192 --> 50:04.626
I'll be down in a minute.

50:04.694 --> 50:06.661
Get down here. We gotta
talk about fast-tracking.

50:06.729 --> 50:07.629
Coffee's on the way.

50:07.697 --> 50:08.863
OK.

50:10.549 --> 50:12.349
Mr. Drummond...

50:13.185 --> 50:14.285
You've objected

50:14.352 --> 50:16.120
to the fast-tracking
of this case.

50:16.188 --> 50:18.122
What's the problem?

50:18.190 --> 50:20.124
Well, your honor, uh...

50:20.192 --> 50:22.159
This issue's already
been ruled upon

50:22.227 --> 50:24.161
by Judge Hale.

50:24.229 --> 50:27.131
Uh, the preparations
required

50:27.199 --> 50:28.633
for fast-tracking
the case

50:28.701 --> 50:30.568
place an undue burden
on both parties,

50:30.636 --> 50:31.535
I believe.

50:31.604 --> 50:33.871
Nonsense.

50:33.939 --> 50:36.741
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Drummond.

50:36.809 --> 50:38.242
As a defense lawyer,

50:38.310 --> 50:40.144
have you <i> ever</i> agreed

50:40.212 --> 50:42.546
to the fast-tracking
of a lawsuit?

50:42.615 --> 50:44.682
Why, your honor,
I believe I have.

50:44.750 --> 50:45.650
[Chuckles]

50:45.718 --> 50:47.118
Fine.

50:47.185 --> 50:49.887
Give me the name of the case
and the court it was in.

50:51.890 --> 50:53.157
Well...

50:53.225 --> 50:54.158
Well, your honor,

50:54.226 --> 50:56.460
I have to get back
to you on that.

50:56.528 --> 50:59.396
Well, call me
this afternoon by 3:00.

51:00.499 --> 51:03.567
I don't believe I'm gonna
be in before 3:00.

51:03.636 --> 51:06.170
JUDGE KIPLER: Oh. Well,
call me when you get in.

51:06.238 --> 51:08.640
I'm very anxious to hear
about this case

51:08.707 --> 51:10.174
you agreed to fast-track.

51:10.242 --> 51:11.676
Yes, sir.

51:11.744 --> 51:14.679
This boy is about to die,
gentlemen.

51:14.747 --> 51:17.716
You do agree that we need
to record his testimony.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.183
Yes, indeed.

51:19.251 --> 51:20.685
Of course,
your honor.

51:20.753 --> 51:22.721
It's just
my trial calendar

51:22.788 --> 51:24.188
is pushing me around
pretty good.

51:24.256 --> 51:27.424
How about next
Thursday afternoon?

51:27.492 --> 51:29.627
Great for me,
your honor.

51:31.163 --> 51:32.596
I'm sorry,
your honor.

51:32.665 --> 51:34.198
That's a week
from today.

51:34.266 --> 51:36.200
I believe
I'm out of town.

51:36.268 --> 51:39.103
Yes, I am out
of town Thursday.

51:40.305 --> 51:43.875
Deposition is set for...

51:43.942 --> 51:46.410
Next Thursday afternoon
at 2 P.M.

51:46.478 --> 51:49.881
Sorry if it inconveniences
the defense,

51:49.948 --> 51:54.085
but God knows there's enough
of you guys to handle it.

51:54.987 --> 51:56.154
JUDGE KIPLER:
Now, what's next?

51:56.221 --> 51:57.655
Oh, uh, your honor,

51:57.723 --> 52:01.525
the motion to dismiss
is still pending.

52:02.695 --> 52:04.128
Ah, yes.

52:04.196 --> 52:07.098
That motion is denied.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.616
Well...

52:08.684 --> 52:10.501
I guess that's it.

52:10.569 --> 52:13.404
Gentlemen, let's go.

52:13.471 --> 52:14.906
Congratulations
on your appointment,

52:14.973 --> 52:15.907
your honor.

52:15.974 --> 52:17.341
Thank you, sir.

52:19.712 --> 52:21.378
And, Mr. Drummond...

52:23.716 --> 52:25.183
don't forget to call me

52:25.250 --> 52:28.870
with the name of that case
you agreed to fast-track.

52:29.338 --> 52:30.872
I'll look around.

52:39.748 --> 52:42.083
You in over your head,
son?

52:45.220 --> 52:46.888
Absolutely.

52:50.258 --> 52:53.661
RUDY: Now Deck wants to do an ad
on the local rap station.

52:53.729 --> 52:55.663
And as much as I'd love
to hear it,

52:55.731 --> 52:56.864
we can't afford it.

52:56.932 --> 52:59.667
Furnishings, bar dues,
750 for a fax machine,

52:59.735 --> 53:01.186
400 for a lease
on a computer,

53:01.253 --> 53:03.688
a down payment
on a new secondhand car,

53:03.755 --> 53:05.756
and we're broke again.

53:06.092 --> 53:09.009
Deck says he's thrilled
with the way things are going.

53:35.687 --> 53:37.255
Whoa.

53:39.942 --> 53:41.209
Rudy. Hi.

53:41.276 --> 53:42.443
Hey, Dot.

53:43.478 --> 53:44.879
Come in.
How are you?

53:44.947 --> 53:46.380
I'm doing good.
How you doing?

53:46.448 --> 53:47.615
Good.

53:47.682 --> 53:50.218
Listen, I'm going up to
Cleveland Wednesday night.

53:50.285 --> 53:51.753
It's the headquarters
of Great Benefit.

53:51.820 --> 53:54.222
I'm gonna take depositions
from all the executives.

53:54.289 --> 53:55.223
Oh.

53:55.290 --> 53:56.557
So...

53:56.625 --> 53:58.726
And don't worry
about expenses, either.

53:58.794 --> 54:00.261
We're gonna
take care of it.

54:00.328 --> 54:01.262
Thank you, Rudy.

54:01.329 --> 54:02.529
It's no problem.

54:02.597 --> 54:03.965
BUDDY: Shh!

54:05.968 --> 54:08.035
It's awkward.

54:08.103 --> 54:09.804
[Donny Ray Coughing]

54:10.672 --> 54:11.939
My associate,
Deck Schifflet.

54:12.007 --> 54:13.174
How do you do?

54:13.242 --> 54:14.242
Hi.

54:14.309 --> 54:16.443
[Dogs Barking]

54:26.021 --> 54:27.922
Hey, Rudy...

54:27.989 --> 54:29.757
Tyrone's here.

54:29.825 --> 54:31.292
OK.

54:31.359 --> 54:32.426
The judge is here.

54:32.494 --> 54:33.594
Oh.

54:33.662 --> 54:35.263
Here, wait, Dot.
Give me that.

54:35.330 --> 54:36.297
Oh.

54:36.364 --> 54:37.832
Thank you.

54:39.701 --> 54:40.634
Hello.

54:40.702 --> 54:41.969
Hello.

54:42.037 --> 54:43.971
Come right in.

54:44.039 --> 54:44.939
Thank you.

54:45.007 --> 54:46.440
This is
Mrs. Black.

54:46.508 --> 54:48.042
His honor
Tyrone Kipler.

54:48.110 --> 54:49.610
It's a privilege
to meet you.

54:49.678 --> 54:50.744
The privilege
is mine.

54:50.813 --> 54:53.781
DOT: Oh, uh, come on in.

54:53.849 --> 54:56.150
There's not a lot
of room here.

54:56.218 --> 54:57.218
Tight.

54:57.286 --> 54:59.453
Let's take a look
outside.

54:59.521 --> 55:01.522
Is that all right
with you, son?

55:02.524 --> 55:04.458
Sure, OK.

55:04.526 --> 55:05.459
RUDY: All right.

55:05.527 --> 55:06.460
All right.

55:06.528 --> 55:08.329
I'll show you the way.

55:20.626 --> 55:22.560
RUDY: I'm looking
at a team of lawyers

55:22.628 --> 55:24.596
who are pulling down
a $1,000 an hour,

55:24.663 --> 55:25.964
and I hate them.

55:26.031 --> 55:28.066
From their lofty perch,

55:28.133 --> 55:30.568
pissing down
on the whole justice system

55:30.636 --> 55:32.336
with disdain.

55:32.404 --> 55:35.573
I used to hate them because
I wasn't good enough for them.

55:35.641 --> 55:38.342
Now I hate them
for who they represent

55:38.410 --> 55:40.427
and what they represent.

55:40.496 --> 55:42.363
DRUMMOND:
Your honor, how are you?

55:42.430 --> 55:43.430
Fine, sir.

55:43.499 --> 55:45.432
Hope the dogs
didn't startle you.

55:45.501 --> 55:47.101
We're doing
this thing outside.

55:47.168 --> 55:48.603
It's a little
cramped inside.

55:48.670 --> 55:50.137
Just have a seat
here.

55:50.205 --> 55:51.939
How you doing?

55:52.007 --> 55:54.108
Good.

56:10.208 --> 56:12.010
Thank you.

Hey, Donny Ray?

56:21.320 --> 56:22.636
Hey.

56:22.704 --> 56:26.173
RUDY: You've already met
Judge Kipler.

56:26.241 --> 56:27.641
Howdy.

56:27.709 --> 56:30.711
This is Leo F. Drummond

56:30.779 --> 56:32.530
and associates.

56:34.366 --> 56:36.801
This here is Tammy.
She's the court reporter.

56:36.868 --> 56:38.803
DONNY RAY: Hi.

56:38.870 --> 56:40.305
JUDGE KIPLER: Swear him in.

56:40.372 --> 56:41.639
TAMMY: Do you swear

56:41.707 --> 56:43.174
the testimony you
are about to give

56:43.241 --> 56:44.676
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

56:44.743 --> 56:46.444
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

56:46.512 --> 56:47.845
Yes, I do.

56:47.913 --> 56:50.448

56:53.668 --> 56:55.086
I told him...

56:55.154 --> 56:56.654
I know. Come here,
come here, come here.

56:56.722 --> 56:58.656
Don't worry about it.
It's just a deposition.

56:58.724 --> 57:00.908
Donny Ray,
I'm Leo Drummond.

57:00.976 --> 57:02.410
I represent
Great Benefit,

57:02.477 --> 57:04.545
and I'm very sorry...

57:04.612 --> 57:06.180
I'm very sorry
to be here

57:06.248 --> 57:07.748
under these
circumstances.

57:07.816 --> 57:09.250
Well, we wouldn't be here

57:09.318 --> 57:11.168
if your clients had done
what they should've done.

57:11.236 --> 57:13.037
DRUMMOND: I beg your pardon?
I didn't hear that.

57:13.372 --> 57:14.055
Hey, kid,

57:14.122 --> 57:15.690
you want a stick
of gum?

57:15.757 --> 57:16.691
Sure.

57:16.758 --> 57:18.225
Here. Did you break
your arm?

57:18.293 --> 57:19.560
Yep.

57:19.628 --> 57:21.062
You had an accident?

57:21.129 --> 57:22.029
Why?

57:22.097 --> 57:24.198
Well, I'm a lawyer,
and, uh...

57:24.265 --> 57:26.701
Give this to your mom...
you his mom?

57:26.768 --> 57:29.704
Maybe I can get you some
money for the accident.

57:43.319 --> 57:45.553
MANAGER: Why don't you
help with the display?

57:45.620 --> 57:48.222
OK. I'll go help
this man first.

57:48.290 --> 57:50.458
Oh, no. I got it.
It's fine.

57:55.464 --> 57:57.231
Can I help you,
sir?

57:57.299 --> 58:00.101
Oh, I'm just looking.

58:20.839 --> 58:23.241
There's a cinema
down the street.

58:23.308 --> 58:25.243
Buy a ticket.
Center section, back row.

58:25.310 --> 58:26.977
Be there in 30 minutes.

58:28.313 --> 58:29.647
OK.

59:07.519 --> 59:09.854
Cliff wants me
to have a baby.

59:13.691 --> 59:16.026
Well, you have
a decision to make.

59:17.529 --> 59:19.497
He's become obsessed
with sex.

59:19.564 --> 59:21.832
He thinks it's going
to keep us together.

59:21.899 --> 59:25.336
Listen, I really don't
want to talk about that.

59:25.403 --> 59:28.556
I just wanted to see you.

01:00:14.034 --> 01:00:15.968
RUDY: I think
I can smell her perfume

01:00:16.036 --> 01:00:18.003
all the way to Cleveland.

01:00:18.071 --> 01:00:21.374
It's hard keeping my mind on
Leo Drummond and his people.

01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:23.609
They'll be flying in,
first class,

01:00:23.677 --> 01:00:25.311
and after
a leisurely dinner,

01:00:25.379 --> 01:00:27.280
they'll meet
in some board room

01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:29.148
and discuss
my total destruction.

01:00:29.216 --> 01:00:31.184
Around the time
I'm checking into motel 6,

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.286
they'll be sleeping soundly
in their suites.

01:00:33.353 --> 01:00:36.322
And they'll wake up
fresh and rested

01:00:36.389 --> 01:00:38.291
and ready for war.

01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:40.326
It's my deposition,

01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:42.528
but it's their turf.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.164
Ah, young Rudy Baylor.

01:00:45.232 --> 01:00:46.632
Just on time, too.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.633
Mr. Drummond.

01:00:47.701 --> 01:00:49.702
Get this boy
some coffee, Tyler.

01:00:49.769 --> 01:00:50.736
Jack Underhall.

01:00:50.804 --> 01:00:51.770
Rudy Baylor.

01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:53.005
Young lawyer is always
a hungry lawyer.

01:00:53.073 --> 01:00:55.507
All these boys claims,
underwriting...

01:00:55.575 --> 01:00:57.376
RUDY: There must be
a 100 years of legal experience

01:00:57.444 --> 01:00:59.011
gathered around the table.

01:00:59.079 --> 01:01:02.548
My staff has flunked
the bar exam 6 times.

01:01:02.616 --> 01:01:04.016
Now, Rudy,
don't be intimidated

01:01:04.084 --> 01:01:06.051
by all these boys on
this side of the table.

01:01:06.119 --> 01:01:08.020
I guarantee, you get
them on the golf course,

01:01:08.088 --> 01:01:10.256
they fold
like a cheap suit.

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:12.525
Let's see.

01:01:12.593 --> 01:01:14.594
Let's see
what we got here.

01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:17.546
I think maybe it's, uh,
appropriate

01:01:17.614 --> 01:01:20.583
to start with
the corporate designee,

01:01:20.651 --> 01:01:22.051
Jack Underhall here.

01:01:22.119 --> 01:01:24.453
RUDY:
I... I don't think so.

01:01:25.322 --> 01:01:26.589
I beg your pardon?

01:01:26.657 --> 01:01:27.690
Well, you heard me.

01:01:27.758 --> 01:01:29.225
I want to start with,
uh, Jackie Lemancyzk,

01:01:29.292 --> 01:01:30.627
the claims handler.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.418
I think it's best we start
with Mr. Underhall.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.088
With all due respect,
Mr. Drummond,

01:01:42.155 --> 01:01:43.589
this is my deposition.

01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:46.259
I'm gonna call these witnesses
in the order in which I see fit,

01:01:46.326 --> 01:01:49.646
so I'd like to start
with Jackie Lemancyzk.

01:01:51.348 --> 01:01:54.416
Maybe we should just
go call the judge.

01:01:56.153 --> 01:01:59.088
Oh, I don't believe
we have to get pugilistic

01:01:59.156 --> 01:02:00.890
this time of the morning.

01:02:00.957 --> 01:02:03.326
I'm not admitting
to being pugilistic.

01:02:04.294 --> 01:02:06.295
We're simply having
a little problem

01:02:06.363 --> 01:02:08.331
with, uh,
Jackie Lemancyzk.

01:02:08.399 --> 01:02:10.233
Uh, this Polish woman.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.235
What sort of problem?

01:02:14.505 --> 01:02:16.605
She doesn't work here
anymore.

01:02:17.474 --> 01:02:18.707
Was she fired?

01:02:18.775 --> 01:02:20.876
She resigned.

01:02:21.878 --> 01:02:23.112
She resigned.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.781
Um, well,
where is she now?

01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:27.133
Well...

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.602
She is no longer working
for our client, and, uh,

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:33.339
we can't produce her
as a witness,

01:02:33.407 --> 01:02:37.076
so let's move along.

01:02:39.063 --> 01:02:40.997
All right.
Russell Crockett.

01:02:41.065 --> 01:02:43.399
Anybody in the room
named Russell Crockett?

01:02:45.903 --> 01:02:47.904
He's gone, too.

01:02:47.971 --> 01:02:49.872
He was downsized.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.140
Downsized?

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.375
Well, what a coincidence.

01:02:53.443 --> 01:02:55.845
Our client's going through
a periodic downsizing.

01:02:55.913 --> 01:02:57.880
Yeah, that will happen,
won't it?

01:03:05.922 --> 01:03:08.357
How about
Everett, uh, Lufkin...

01:03:08.425 --> 01:03:09.892
Vice President of Claims.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.727
Has he been downsized,
too?

01:03:12.796 --> 01:03:14.263
No, he's here.

01:03:18.435 --> 01:03:19.869
RUDY:
You're Everett Lufkin?

01:03:19.937 --> 01:03:21.938
Mm-hmm.

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.357
My congratulations...

01:03:24.424 --> 01:03:25.891
Mr. Lufkin...

01:03:25.959 --> 01:03:28.394
On your miraculous
survival

01:03:28.462 --> 01:03:30.529
of the carnage of late
here at Great Benefit.

01:03:30.597 --> 01:03:32.764
[Coughs Loudly]

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.701
DRUMMOND: Whoo.

01:03:38.355 --> 01:03:42.125
I may not be 100% today,
but I'm here in spirit.

01:03:42.192 --> 01:03:43.709
[Men Chuckling]

01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:50.215
I'm curious.

01:03:50.283 --> 01:03:52.050
DRUMMOND: About what?

01:03:53.019 --> 01:03:55.471
I'm just wondering.

01:03:56.606 --> 01:03:59.008
Do you even remember
when you first sold out?

01:04:05.348 --> 01:04:08.818
You're an arrogant
little piss ant, aren't you?

01:04:11.855 --> 01:04:14.090
I advise you
to mind your manners.

01:04:14.158 --> 01:04:15.658
You're in
the big water now.

01:04:15.725 --> 01:04:17.393
Mind my manners?

01:04:19.596 --> 01:04:22.165
I come up here
from Memphis

01:04:22.232 --> 01:04:24.167
to depose 4 people,

01:04:24.234 --> 01:04:26.669
2 of whom are not here,

01:04:26.736 --> 01:04:29.605
and you tell me
to mind my manners?

01:04:29.673 --> 01:04:31.707
Well, it's your dime.

01:04:31.775 --> 01:04:33.742
What's your call, son?

01:04:35.946 --> 01:04:37.346
I'm gonna depose him...

01:04:37.414 --> 01:04:39.665
Mr. Lufkin over there...

01:04:39.732 --> 01:04:40.899
then I'm gonna pack up,

01:04:40.967 --> 01:04:43.152
I'm gonna go back
to Memphis.

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:49.692
RUDY: So this is how
the uninsured die.

01:04:49.759 --> 01:04:52.195
In a society filled
with brilliant doctors

01:04:52.262 --> 01:04:54.197
and state-of-the-art
technology,

01:04:54.264 --> 01:04:57.900
it's obscene to let this boy
just wither away and die.

01:04:57.967 --> 01:04:59.868
He was covered
by an insurance policy

01:04:59.936 --> 01:05:02.238
that his mother
paid good money for.

01:05:02.306 --> 01:05:05.241
It wasn't big money,
but it was good money.

01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:07.210
I'm alone in this trial.

01:05:07.277 --> 01:05:10.680
I'm seriously outgunned,
and I'm scared,

01:05:10.747 --> 01:05:12.381
but I'm right.

01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:15.751
I sit here with
this poor suffering kid,

01:05:15.819 --> 01:05:18.053
and I swear revenge.

01:05:19.189 --> 01:05:21.306

Hello?

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.234
KELLY: Rudy, it's me.

01:05:32.302 --> 01:05:33.769
What's... what's wrong?

01:05:33.836 --> 01:05:34.736
[Sobs]

01:05:34.804 --> 01:05:36.272
I need your help.

01:05:36.339 --> 01:05:38.240
Where are you?

01:05:38.308 --> 01:05:39.741
I'm at the store.

01:05:39.809 --> 01:05:41.743
OK, um, don't move, OK?

01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:43.279
I'm gonna
be right there.

She's in here.

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:14.509
Thanks for coming.

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:27.039
What happened?

01:06:27.374 --> 01:06:28.857
Come on,
let's show him.

01:06:42.672 --> 01:06:44.573

It's all right.

01:06:46.909 --> 01:06:47.876
Ohh.

01:06:47.944 --> 01:06:50.312
Oh, Rudy,
I'm so glad you called.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.813
Come. Come.

01:06:51.881 --> 01:06:53.815
Oh, you poor child.

01:06:53.883 --> 01:06:56.852
I'm gonna
take care of you now.

01:06:56.919 --> 01:06:57.986
Don't you worry.

01:06:58.054 --> 01:07:00.022
Don't you worry.
We'll manage just fine.

01:07:00.089 --> 01:07:01.157
All right.

01:07:01.224 --> 01:07:02.858
You know where I'll be
if you need me.

01:07:02.925 --> 01:07:04.326
MISS BIRDIE: I do. I do.

01:07:04.394 --> 01:07:05.861
RUDY: I tell myself

01:07:05.928 --> 01:07:07.846
I'll do whatever
I have to do

01:07:07.915 --> 01:07:09.315
to get her out of this

01:07:09.383 --> 01:07:12.018
because this guy's never gonna
stop until he's killed her.

01:07:12.085 --> 01:07:13.386
Never.

01:07:34.407 --> 01:07:36.074
Well...

01:07:37.076 --> 01:07:39.845
Now it's
a wrongful death suit.

Hey!

01:09:31.524 --> 01:09:32.457
For bugs?

01:09:32.526 --> 01:09:33.692

This bugging device

01:10:03.556 --> 01:10:05.891
Medium-grade circuitry.

01:10:07.593 --> 01:10:09.728
It's a weak transmitter.

01:10:10.897 --> 01:10:14.066
Probably manufactured
in Czechoslovakia.

01:10:15.201 --> 01:10:17.002
No, I don't think

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.738
the cops or the feds
would place this.

01:10:20.907 --> 01:10:23.008
Somebody else
is listening.

01:10:23.076 --> 01:10:25.544
Who else would be
listening to us?

01:10:25.611 --> 01:10:26.511
Hmm.

01:10:26.579 --> 01:10:28.747
I got a pretty good idea.

01:10:33.519 --> 01:10:34.686

You need anything
from downtown?

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:39.058
No.

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:41.060
Hey, guess what.
Guess who wants to settle.

01:10:41.127 --> 01:10:42.227

01:10:42.295 --> 01:10:43.728
Dot Black.

01:10:43.796 --> 01:10:45.431
Dot Black?

01:10:45.498 --> 01:10:47.066
I went by there today,

01:10:47.133 --> 01:10:49.034
and, uh,
check up on her.

01:10:49.102 --> 01:10:50.535
I brought her
a fruitcake.

01:10:50.603 --> 01:10:53.538
Yeah, and she said she just
doesn't have the willpower

01:10:53.606 --> 01:10:56.075
to stand a long trial

01:10:56.142 --> 01:10:57.042
and, uh...

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.043

01:10:58.111 --> 01:10:59.979
She said
she'd take 175.

01:11:00.046 --> 01:11:01.747

we should take it.

We'll sleep on it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:05.918

and I feel this woman
wants to settle.

01:11:20.533 --> 01:11:22.635
I'll talk to her.

and call her.

one while.

01:11:51.364 --> 01:11:52.764
Let's say, Rudy,

01:11:52.832 --> 01:11:55.267
just for the sake of putting
the numbers on the board,

01:11:55.335 --> 01:11:56.801
that if the claim
was covered

01:11:56.869 --> 01:11:59.771
that my client should have
paid out somewhere

01:11:59.839 --> 01:12:02.508
around 150-175,000.

Well, if you say so.

nightmare?

We investigated
their backgrounds,

01:12:40.447 --> 01:12:42.648
and we rated them
with plus or minus numbers.

to do?

RUDY: Any direct contact

01:12:48.455 --> 01:12:49.855
would of course
be a serious offense.

insurance company

for an operation.

what I'm about to ask

is the most important
question of the day.

Bingo.

Mr. Deck Schifflet.

Objection, your honor!

01:14:55.698 --> 01:14:56.932
This is an outrage!

What are you doing,
Mr. Drummond?

DRUMMOND: Your honor,

01:15:00.069 --> 01:15:01.703
we have reason to believe

01:15:02.138 --> 01:15:03.605

has been tampered with.

And he's
accusing me.

01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:08.443
I don't understand what
you're doing, Mr. Drummond.

01:15:08.511 --> 01:15:09.444
Well, neither do I,
your honor.

01:15:09.512 --> 01:15:10.445
Neither do I.

Approach the bench, please.

Your honor, this panel's
been tampered with.

01:15:18.505 --> 01:15:19.604
I want proof, Leo.

01:15:19.672 --> 01:15:22.474
I can't say
without divulging

01:15:22.542 --> 01:15:24.209
confidential information,
your honor.

01:15:24.277 --> 01:15:25.310

out of your mind.

rather bizarrely.

of something like that.

01:15:32.018 --> 01:15:33.318
Tamper. I...

01:15:33.386 --> 01:15:34.920
it's ridiculous.

01:15:34.987 --> 01:15:36.955
Just allow me to finish
questioning the panel.

01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:38.623
I think the truth
will come forth.

01:15:38.691 --> 01:15:41.226
KIPLER: Any objection,
Mr. Baylor?

01:15:41.294 --> 01:15:42.428
No, no objection.

01:15:42.495 --> 01:15:45.264
Very well. Proceed.

01:15:45.331 --> 01:15:46.498
Right.

01:15:48.834 --> 01:15:52.371
What in the Sam hill
is going on up there?

01:15:52.572 --> 01:15:54.205
Oh, it's just
lawyer stuff.

01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:56.241
DRUMMOND: Mr. Porter.

01:15:56.309 --> 01:16:00.929
I want to ask you
a direct question.

01:16:00.997 --> 01:16:02.463
And I'd appreciate

01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:05.834
an honest response.

01:16:05.902 --> 01:16:08.170
You ask an honest
question,

01:16:08.237 --> 01:16:09.838
I'll give you
an honest answer.

01:16:09.906 --> 01:16:12.074
Fair enough.

01:16:12.141 --> 01:16:14.209
Did you, Mr. Porter,
or did you not

01:16:14.276 --> 01:16:16.444
have a phone conversation
a few days ago

01:16:16.512 --> 01:16:17.879
with Mr. Rudy Baylor?

01:16:17.947 --> 01:16:19.081
Hell, no.

01:16:19.148 --> 01:16:21.482
DRUMMOND: I thought
you were gonna give me

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:22.617
an honest answer.

01:16:22.685 --> 01:16:24.920
I gave you an honest answer.

01:16:24.987 --> 01:16:27.089
Are you sure,
Mr. Porter?

01:16:27.256 --> 01:16:28.807
I'm damn sure.

01:16:28.874 --> 01:16:30.075
Mr. Porter,

01:16:30.143 --> 01:16:31.510
in a courthouse.

01:16:31.578 --> 01:16:33.278
In a courthouse
in the United States,

01:16:33.346 --> 01:16:35.614
in a courthouse of justice,
state of Tennessee,

01:16:35.681 --> 01:16:38.117
I say you did not provide
an honest answer!

01:16:38.184 --> 01:16:39.234
Don't call me a liar.

01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:40.152
Mr. Drummond.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.887
You son of a bitch.

01:16:44.557 --> 01:16:46.091
Hey, get off him!

01:16:46.159 --> 01:16:47.426
JUDGE KIPLER:
Order in the court!

01:16:49.428 --> 01:16:50.896
Bailiff,

01:16:50.964 --> 01:16:52.831
remove Mr. Porter
from this courtroom.

01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:56.267
Mr. Billy Porter,
you are excused from the jury.

01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:00.955
DRUMMOND: Your honor,

01:17:01.023 --> 01:17:04.926
I move to dismiss the entire
panel, your honor.

01:17:04.994 --> 01:17:07.045
Denied.

01:17:07.113 --> 01:17:08.514
It's been tainted.

01:17:15.188 --> 01:17:17.489
You, uh...

01:17:18.558 --> 01:17:21.426
Your shoe,
you left it...

01:17:24.297 --> 01:17:25.864
JUDGE KIPLER: Are we ready
to proceed now

01:17:25.931 --> 01:17:28.900
with the jury selection,
Mr. Drummond?

01:17:28.968 --> 01:17:32.237
DRUMMOND: I'm ready
to proceed, your honor.

01:17:32.305 --> 01:17:34.673
KIPLER: Thank you.

01:17:57.647 --> 01:17:59.614
We'll file it today.

01:17:59.682 --> 01:18:00.782
He'll go crazy.

01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:01.850
He already is crazy.

01:18:01.917 --> 01:18:04.853
He'll come after you.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.154
I hope he does.

01:18:06.221 --> 01:18:08.940
This is that good
processed Turkey.

01:18:09.008 --> 01:18:10.575
Oh.
Oh.

01:18:10.643 --> 01:18:13.044
Well, I gotta get
back to court.

01:18:13.112 --> 01:18:15.146
I'm late. I gotta
get back to court.

01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:16.782
What about
your sandwich?

01:18:16.849 --> 01:18:19.484
Oh, I was gonna
take that with me.

01:18:19.552 --> 01:18:21.953
Good, good.

01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:23.354
I'll see you
later.

01:18:23.423 --> 01:18:25.189
OK?

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.467
How'd it go?

01:18:35.535 --> 01:18:37.436
I served the papers
on Cliff

01:18:37.503 --> 01:18:39.037
when he was
on his way to lunch.

01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:40.672
He didn't take it
too well,

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.541
but I said I was
ready to rumble.

01:18:42.608 --> 01:18:43.642
He backed down.

01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:46.878
Hey, man, you better
watch your back.

01:18:48.848 --> 01:18:50.214
All right.

01:18:50.282 --> 01:18:53.685
Thanks a lot, Butch.
I appreciate it.

01:18:53.753 --> 01:18:54.853
CLERK:
Do you solemnly swear

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.322
that the testimony you're
about to give in this cause

01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:58.423
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

01:18:58.491 --> 01:19:00.392
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.426
Yes, I do.

01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:04.345
You may take
the stand.

01:19:10.652 --> 01:19:13.621
Please state your name
for the record.

01:19:13.689 --> 01:19:17.392
Mrs. Margarine Black.

01:19:17.459 --> 01:19:19.060
Now, Mrs. Black,

01:19:19.128 --> 01:19:21.363
you are the mother
of Donny Ray Black,

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:23.698
who recently died of acute
myelocytic leukemia

01:19:23.766 --> 01:19:24.933
because the defendant,
Great Benefit...

01:19:25.001 --> 01:19:26.334
DRUMMOND:
Objection.

01:19:26.402 --> 01:19:28.336
Leading.

01:19:28.404 --> 01:19:31.907
Sustained.

01:19:34.127 --> 01:19:35.226
Your son,

01:19:35.294 --> 01:19:37.362
Donny Ray,
needed an operation.

01:19:37.429 --> 01:19:38.363
Objection.

01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:39.531
Leading.

01:19:39.598 --> 01:19:41.299
KIPLER: Sustained.

01:19:43.736 --> 01:19:46.471
Mrs. Black, did you purchase
this medical policy

01:19:46.673 --> 01:19:48.723
because you were concerned about
medical care for your son?

01:19:48.791 --> 01:19:49.724
Objection.

01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:51.159
I'm sorry, your honor.

01:19:51.226 --> 01:19:52.694
Leading.

01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:54.796
KIPLER: Mr. Baylor,

01:19:54.864 --> 01:19:56.598
why don't you
show the policy

01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:58.332
and ask her
why she bought it?

01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.734
RUDY: OK.

01:20:01.637 --> 01:20:04.172
Mr. Baylor.

01:20:04.239 --> 01:20:07.075
You must ask
to approach the witness.

01:20:07.142 --> 01:20:11.245
RUDY: Sorry,
your honor.

01:20:11.313 --> 01:20:12.614
Permission to approach
the witness.

01:20:12.682 --> 01:20:13.949
You may.

01:20:17.319 --> 01:20:19.504
[Whispering]
Take it easy.

01:20:19.572 --> 01:20:22.207
Take it easy.

01:20:22.274 --> 01:20:25.477
MRS. BLACK: "Great Benefit.
July 7, 1996.

01:20:25.545 --> 01:20:34.085

Read it again.

Objection.

01:21:04.967 --> 01:21:05.934
Repetitious,

01:21:06.002 --> 01:21:07.135
KIPLER: Sustained.

01:21:09.705 --> 01:21:11.405
I tender
the witness.

01:21:11.473 --> 01:21:13.041
Mr. Drummond.

01:21:13.109 --> 01:21:15.010
Your honor.

01:21:15.077 --> 01:21:18.179
Please remove that exhibit.

01:21:18.247 --> 01:21:20.682
Now, Mrs. Black.

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:21.916
Ahem.

01:21:23.318 --> 01:21:25.253
Turn it off.

01:21:28.975 --> 01:21:33.578
Mrs. Black, why did you sue
Great Benefit for $10 million?

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.797
Is that all?

01:21:37.232 --> 01:21:38.800
I beg your pardon.

01:21:38.868 --> 01:21:41.553
I thought it was
more than that.

01:21:41.621 --> 01:21:43.371
Is that so?

01:21:43.673 --> 01:21:45.690
Yes. Your client has
about a billion dollars,

01:21:45.758 --> 01:21:47.626
and your client
killed my son.

01:21:47.693 --> 01:21:51.630
I wanted to sue
for a whole lot more.

01:21:52.447 --> 01:21:55.083
What would you do
with the money?

01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:57.052
If this jury awards you
$10 million,

01:21:57.119 --> 01:21:58.553
what you gonna do
with the money?

01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.554
I'm gonna give it

01:21:59.621 --> 01:22:02.490
to the American
leukemia society.

01:22:02.558 --> 01:22:04.258
Every cent.

01:22:05.427 --> 01:22:08.947
I don't want a dime
of your stinking money.

01:22:09.014 --> 01:22:13.051
DRUMMOND: Realize you are
under oath, Mrs. Black.

01:22:13.118 --> 01:22:15.286
Approach the witness,
your honor?

01:22:15.354 --> 01:22:16.671
KIPLER: You may.

01:22:16.739 --> 01:22:17.672
DRUMMOND: Mrs. Black,

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.674
I want you to read
from the policy.

01:22:19.742 --> 01:22:24.012
Page 16, section "K,"
paragraph 14, item "E,"

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.380
in which
the insurance company

01:22:25.447 --> 01:22:27.015
has in plain
English wording said

01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:30.385
that it will not pay for
experimental procedures.

01:22:30.452 --> 01:22:33.188
Now, your lawsuit says

01:22:33.256 --> 01:22:35.523
that your son would have
been saved if he had had

01:22:35.591 --> 01:22:36.925
a bone marrow
transplant.

01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:38.994
Isn't it a fact,
Mrs. Black,

01:22:39.061 --> 01:22:40.461
that there are
only 7,000

01:22:40.529 --> 01:22:42.614
bone marrow transplants
performed a year

01:22:42.681 --> 01:22:44.015
in the United States?

01:22:44.082 --> 01:22:45.683
Less than 200 in
the state of Tennessee?

01:22:45.751 --> 01:22:46.917
Objection,
your honor.

01:22:46.985 --> 01:22:48.186
He's leading
the witness.

01:22:48.254 --> 01:22:50.688
This is cross-examination.
Leading is allowed.

01:22:50.756 --> 01:22:52.557
Overruled,

01:22:52.625 --> 01:22:54.526
as to leading.

01:22:54.593 --> 01:22:59.030
DRUMMOND: So it was not
covered by the policy.

01:22:59.097 --> 01:23:00.097
Now, Mrs. Black,

01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:02.900
who was it, uh...

01:23:02.968 --> 01:23:06.204
Who was it first diagnosed
your son's condition?

01:23:07.523 --> 01:23:09.457
Well, at the very
beginning,

01:23:09.525 --> 01:23:12.994
our doctor,
Dr. page.

01:23:13.062 --> 01:23:15.430
DRUMMOND: That would be
your family physician?

01:23:15.497 --> 01:23:17.132
Yes, sir, it would.

01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:18.599
Is he a good doctor?

01:23:18.667 --> 01:23:20.368
He's a very good doctor.

01:23:20.436 --> 01:23:22.938
And is it not true,
Mrs. Black,

01:23:23.005 --> 01:23:24.439
that this capable,
truthful man

01:23:24.506 --> 01:23:28.392
told you repeatedly
that a bone marrow transplant

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:29.493
would do your son no good

01:23:29.562 --> 01:23:32.664
because of the type
of leukemia he had?

01:23:33.933 --> 01:23:35.700
Well, no.

01:23:35.768 --> 01:23:37.084
No, he did not.

01:23:37.152 --> 01:23:38.119
He didn't say that.

01:23:38.187 --> 01:23:40.822
Not like that,
to me.

01:23:42.257 --> 01:23:43.425
DRUMMOND: Approach
the witness, your honor?

01:23:43.492 --> 01:23:44.892
KIPLER: You may.

01:23:45.328 --> 01:23:50.665
Mrs. Black, is this not
Dr. page's letterhead?

01:23:50.732 --> 01:23:53.734
And at the bottom there,
is that not his signature?

01:23:53.802 --> 01:23:55.570
[Whispering]
He can't do that.

01:23:55.637 --> 01:23:57.038
Why?

01:23:57.106 --> 01:23:58.106
Because he can't
introduce evidence

01:23:58.174 --> 01:24:00.408
that way.
Plus it's hearsay.

01:24:00.476 --> 01:24:02.310
Objection, your honor.

01:24:02.378 --> 01:24:06.281
A... a letter from... from
the Blacks' family physician

01:24:06.349 --> 01:24:08.416
to Mr. Drummond
is inadmissible.

01:24:08.484 --> 01:24:10.385
DRUMMOND: That is quite
correct, your honor.

01:24:10.453 --> 01:24:12.287
And I'm not asking
for this letter

01:24:12.355 --> 01:24:13.754
to be admitted
into evidence.

01:24:13.822 --> 01:24:16.458
I'm simply asking
that this witness

01:24:16.525 --> 01:24:17.592
be allowed
to read the letter

01:24:17.659 --> 01:24:19.394
under rule 612
of the Tennessee

01:24:19.462 --> 01:24:20.728
rules of evidence.

01:24:20.796 --> 01:24:22.597
So her recollection
can be refreshed.

01:24:22.664 --> 01:24:25.100
KIPLER: Mr. Baylor,
what do you say?

01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:26.734
I don't know, your honor.

01:24:26.802 --> 01:24:27.935
I just object to this.

01:24:28.004 --> 01:24:31.772
And also we were not
furnished this letter

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.241
in pre-trial discovery.

01:24:33.309 --> 01:24:35.776
What do you say
to that, Mr. Drummond?

01:24:35.844 --> 01:24:37.578
I had no idea this
letter would be needed.

01:24:37.646 --> 01:24:39.331
I expected this lady
to tell the truth

01:24:39.398 --> 01:24:41.032
about what her doctor
told her.

01:24:43.052 --> 01:24:45.220
Anything else, Mr. Baylor?

01:24:47.289 --> 01:24:48.823
No.

01:24:50.893 --> 01:24:52.060
KIPLER: Mr. Drummond,

01:24:52.127 --> 01:24:54.795
I'm gonna give you
a little latitude,

01:24:54.864 --> 01:24:56.865
but don't stray too far.

01:24:56.932 --> 01:24:59.117
Very well, your honor.
Now, Mrs. Black,

01:24:59.185 --> 01:25:01.752
does that letter refresh
your recollection

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:04.055
as to whether or not
Donny Ray's leukemia

01:25:04.123 --> 01:25:05.423
was the kind
that could be helped

01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:06.657
with a bone marrow
transplant?

01:25:06.725 --> 01:25:09.027
Well, see, now,
he is not a specialist.

01:25:09.095 --> 01:25:10.028
But he is a licensed,

01:25:10.096 --> 01:25:13.498
experienced,
capable physician

01:25:13.565 --> 01:25:16.184
who lovingly told you
time and time again

01:25:16.252 --> 01:25:19.453
what you quite understandably
did not want to accept:

01:25:19.521 --> 01:25:22.357
That your son
was going to die of leukemia

01:25:22.424 --> 01:25:25.226
despite the best efforts
of medical science.

01:25:25.294 --> 01:25:26.660
Is that not true?

01:25:26.728 --> 01:25:29.297
MRS. BLACK: But he wasn't
a specialist.

01:25:29.365 --> 01:25:30.765
I didn't believe him.

01:25:30.832 --> 01:25:33.902
DRUMMOND: Not only did you
not believe him, ma'am,

01:25:33.969 --> 01:25:35.586
but you were less than
truthful with me

01:25:35.655 --> 01:25:37.722
and with this jury
moments ago

01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:39.240
when you told us under oath

01:25:39.308 --> 01:25:42.310
that Dr. page never said
that your son

01:25:42.378 --> 01:25:44.562
had the type of leukemia
that could not be treated

01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:46.031
by a bone marrow transplant.

01:25:46.098 --> 01:25:48.166
I believe
your exact words were,

01:25:48.234 --> 01:25:50.402
"he never said that.

01:25:50.469 --> 01:25:51.602
"Not like that

01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:53.438
to me."

01:25:53.506 --> 01:25:56.408
He wasn't a specialist.

01:25:56.475 --> 01:25:58.776
I just wanted Donny Ray

01:25:58.844 --> 01:26:04.149
to have the best medical
treatment available.

01:26:04.216 --> 01:26:06.634
You'd do the same thing.

01:26:06.701 --> 01:26:08.769
DRUMMOND:
Of course, ma'am.

01:26:08.837 --> 01:26:11.539
Of course.

01:26:11.606 --> 01:26:13.241
That'll be all.

01:26:15.544 --> 01:26:17.812
You may step down,
Mrs. Black.

01:26:25.354 --> 01:26:27.788
I didn't do very good,
did I?

01:26:27.856 --> 01:26:29.457
Oh, no, no,
you did fine.

01:26:29.524 --> 01:26:30.624
You did fine.

01:26:30.692 --> 01:26:32.760
It's all right.
The jury can see

01:26:32.828 --> 01:26:34.395
exactly what
he's up to.

01:26:34.463 --> 01:26:35.863
The jury can see
what he's up to.

01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:36.897
I need a smoke.

01:26:36.966 --> 01:26:37.865
I know you do.

01:26:37.933 --> 01:26:38.766
We're gonna get
to that later.

01:26:38.834 --> 01:26:40.418
[Thunder]

01:26:41.387 --> 01:26:42.387
[Kelly Sighs]

01:26:42.454 --> 01:26:45.390
I hope he hasn't
changed the locks.

01:26:45.457 --> 01:26:47.025
Are you scared?

01:26:47.092 --> 01:26:49.127
Yeah.

01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:52.997
Let's do it.

01:26:56.167 --> 01:26:57.535
[Thunder]

01:27:19.758 --> 01:27:21.558
What a pig.

01:27:22.427 --> 01:27:23.627
I'm sorry.

01:27:23.695 --> 01:27:26.430
Hurry, Kelly.
Come on.

01:27:29.101 --> 01:27:31.568
There's more of my stuff
in the closet.

01:27:40.012 --> 01:27:42.513
You can't take
everything, Kelly.

01:27:46.484 --> 01:27:48.052
[Lock Turns]

01:27:57.896 --> 01:28:00.030
KELLY: Oh, no.

01:28:00.899 --> 01:28:03.400
CLIFF: Hey, hello!

01:28:03.469 --> 01:28:05.069
I'm home!

01:28:05.904 --> 01:28:07.805
Well, what do you know?

01:28:07.873 --> 01:28:10.441
What do we have here?

01:28:10.508 --> 01:28:12.343
What you two been doing
in here, huh?

01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:14.229
Hey, take it easy,
all right?

01:28:14.296 --> 01:28:14.979
Come on, tell me.

01:28:15.046 --> 01:28:16.046
I'm your husband.
Remember that, huh?

01:28:16.114 --> 01:28:17.047
Take it easy, Buddy.

01:28:17.115 --> 01:28:18.015
You shut up!

01:28:18.484 --> 01:28:19.801
Hey, listen, Buddy,
all right.

01:28:19.868 --> 01:28:20.802
I ain't listening
to nothing!

01:28:20.869 --> 01:28:22.670
Take it easy.

01:28:22.738 --> 01:28:23.671
Aah!

01:28:23.739 --> 01:28:24.639
You hurt me, baby.

01:28:24.707 --> 01:28:25.873
You hurt me so bad.

01:28:25.941 --> 01:28:26.941
[Window Breaks]

01:28:27.009 --> 01:28:29.376
Why are you
doing this to me?!

01:28:29.444 --> 01:28:30.578
No, Cliff!

01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:36.700
KELLY: Run!

01:29:09.434 --> 01:29:11.102
Rudy, Rudy!

01:29:11.169 --> 01:29:12.169

01:29:12.237 --> 01:29:13.304
You idiot,
what are you doing?!

01:29:13.372 --> 01:29:14.471
You see what you did?

01:29:14.539 --> 01:29:15.956
Kelly!

01:29:16.024 --> 01:29:17.958
Is this what you wanted?

01:29:18.026 --> 01:29:19.160
It's not my fault!

01:29:19.227 --> 01:29:21.262
I love you!
I love you!

01:29:33.942 --> 01:29:35.576

[Rudy Hits Cliff]

01:29:41.183 --> 01:29:42.750
KELLY: Stop it, Rudy.

01:29:42.818 --> 01:29:44.318
Stop.

01:29:44.386 --> 01:29:46.253
CLIFF: Ohh.

01:29:46.321 --> 01:29:48.539
Give me the bat
and leave.

01:29:48.606 --> 01:29:50.307
What?

01:29:51.827 --> 01:29:54.161
Give me the bat and leave.

01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:56.831
You were not here tonight.

01:29:56.898 --> 01:29:58.833
Give me the bat.

01:30:13.182 --> 01:30:14.148
Go, Rudy.

01:30:14.216 --> 01:30:16.384
You were not here tonight.

01:30:20.823 --> 01:30:22.940
[Bat Hits Cliff]

01:30:39.341 --> 01:30:40.842
[Starts Engine]

01:30:53.288 --> 01:30:55.189
He's finally killed her.

01:30:55.257 --> 01:30:57.191
No, it's him.
He's dead.

01:30:57.259 --> 01:30:58.292
You sure?

01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.326
Just saw her.

01:30:59.395 --> 01:31:00.561
How'd it happen?

01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:01.629
I don't know.

01:31:01.697 --> 01:31:03.398
RUDY: They say
when you commit a murder,

01:31:03.465 --> 01:31:04.766
you make
at least 25 mistakes,

01:31:04.833 --> 01:31:07.968
and later you're lucky
if you remember 5 of 'em.

01:31:08.036 --> 01:31:09.103
It was self-defense,

01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:11.205
but I can't get past
the fact that he's dead.

01:31:11.273 --> 01:31:13.708
And the mistakes are piling
up in my mind so fast

01:31:13.776 --> 01:31:15.510
I can't think.

01:31:17.245 --> 01:31:18.446
RUDY: But Kelly knew.

01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:20.080
She knew what to do.

01:31:20.148 --> 01:31:21.682
She knew it was time.

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:24.552
With everything
that was happening

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.387
and all that was at stake,

01:31:26.455 --> 01:31:30.174
her first thought
was for my safety.

01:31:30.242 --> 01:31:33.160
And I left her in there
all alone.

01:31:34.596 --> 01:31:36.380
Damn it!

01:31:36.447 --> 01:31:37.648
God damn you, Kelly!

01:31:37.716 --> 01:31:39.383
What the hell's
going on here?

01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:41.452
What the hell
did you do?

my son!

01:32:26.631 --> 01:32:29.116
Excuse me.
I'm her lawyer.

01:32:29.184 --> 01:32:32.153
I insist on being here
while she's being questioned.

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.621
This is
your attorney?

01:32:33.688 --> 01:32:35.322
KELLY: Yes, sir.

01:32:37.159 --> 01:32:40.093
I want her released
to my custody.

01:32:40.162 --> 01:32:41.328
I can't do that

01:32:41.396 --> 01:32:43.297
I don't know what kind
of lawyer you are,

01:32:43.365 --> 01:32:44.865
but we got
a dead body here,

01:32:44.932 --> 01:32:47.801
and bond needs to be set
by a judge.

01:32:47.869 --> 01:32:49.403
I'm going to jail?

01:32:49.471 --> 01:32:52.005
Well, can we arrange
for a private cell?

01:32:52.073 --> 01:32:54.308
Look, asshole,
I don't run the jail.

01:32:54.376 --> 01:32:56.343
You got a better way
of doing things,

01:32:56.411 --> 01:32:58.546
then you need to talk
to the jailer.

01:32:58.613 --> 01:33:00.847
They love lawyers
down there, right?

01:33:00.915 --> 01:33:03.384
Look...

01:33:03.452 --> 01:33:05.336
If your lawyer here
is worth his salt,

01:33:05.404 --> 01:33:06.837
you'll be out of here

01:33:06.905 --> 01:33:09.156
sometime tomorrow if
you can post bond, OK?

01:33:11.326 --> 01:33:12.960
OK.

01:33:26.224 --> 01:33:27.975
They're watching us
through that window there,

01:33:28.043 --> 01:33:30.744
and this room
is probably bugged,

01:33:30.812 --> 01:33:33.847
so just be careful
what you say.

01:33:33.916 --> 01:33:35.749
What does
"manslaughter" mean?

01:33:35.817 --> 01:33:38.685
It's just murder without
the element of intent.

01:33:38.753 --> 01:33:40.621
How much time
could I get?

01:33:40.688 --> 01:33:42.223
No, no, no, you have
to be convicted first.

01:33:42.291 --> 01:33:44.825
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

01:33:44.893 --> 01:33:47.728
That's not gonna happen.

01:33:51.566 --> 01:33:55.202
Cross your wrists
behind you please, ma'am.

01:33:59.641 --> 01:34:01.675
This way, ma'am.

you are the Vice
President of Claims

LUFKIN: Yes, I am.

01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:15.422
Approach the witness,

01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:17.091
You may.

01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:21.428
You recognize this?

01:34:21.496 --> 01:34:22.630
Go on.

01:34:24.733 --> 01:34:26.901
RUDY: Read that
to the jury.

01:34:29.605 --> 01:34:30.705
"Dear Mrs. Black,

That's you?

01:34:43.635 --> 01:34:44.901
Yes.

01:34:47.272 --> 01:34:49.240
How do you explain that?

01:34:54.363 --> 01:34:56.998
It was a difficult time
for me personally.

01:34:57.065 --> 01:34:59.600
I was under
a lot of stress.

01:34:59.667 --> 01:35:03.153
We had denied this claim
7 times before.

01:35:03.221 --> 01:35:05.822
I was trying to be emphatic.

01:35:05.890 --> 01:35:07.491
I snapped.

01:35:07.559 --> 01:35:09.092
I regret
having written the letter,

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.595
and I apologize.

01:35:11.663 --> 01:35:12.896
Don't you think
it's a little late

01:35:12.964 --> 01:35:14.365
for an apology?

01:35:15.984 --> 01:35:17.718
Maybe.

01:35:17.786 --> 01:35:18.753
Maybe?

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.855
The boy is dead,
isn't he?

01:35:24.226 --> 01:35:26.827
Yes.

01:35:26.895 --> 01:35:28.812
Now, Mr. Lufkin,

who is Jackie Lemancyzk?

01:35:31.249 --> 01:35:37.154
Jackie Lemancyzk
is a former claims handler.

01:35:37.222 --> 01:35:39.056
And did she work
in your department?

01:35:39.258 --> 01:35:40.057
Yes.

01:35:40.125 --> 01:35:42.226
And when did she
stop working

01:35:42.293 --> 01:35:43.260

01:35:43.328 --> 01:35:46.097
I don't remember the day.

01:35:46.164 --> 01:35:48.098
How about October 30?

01:35:48.166 --> 01:35:49.634
Sounds close.

01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:51.952
Wasn't that just 2 days
before she was scheduled

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:53.887
to give a deposition
in this case?

01:35:53.955 --> 01:35:55.522
I really don't remember.

01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:58.291
I'd like to refresh the
witness' recollection

01:35:58.359 --> 01:36:01.095
under rule 612.

01:36:03.698 --> 01:36:05.065
October 30th.

01:36:05.133 --> 01:36:06.266
Apparently.

01:36:06.334 --> 01:36:07.500
And that was just 2 days
before she was scheduled

01:36:07.568 --> 01:36:08.602
to give a deposition
in this matter?

01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:10.287
I guess so.

01:36:10.355 --> 01:36:11.755
And she was
the person responsible

01:36:11.823 --> 01:36:13.324
for handling
Donny Ray Black's claim,

01:36:13.391 --> 01:36:14.291
was she not?

01:36:14.359 --> 01:36:16.160
That's correct.

01:36:16.228 --> 01:36:17.595
And you fired her?

01:36:19.564 --> 01:36:21.698
Of course not.

01:36:21.766 --> 01:36:24.101
Well, how'd you
get rid of her?

01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:25.269
She resigned.

01:36:25.337 --> 01:36:27.804
It's right here in the letter
you just gave me.

01:36:27.872 --> 01:36:29.740
Oh. Why'd she resign?

01:36:30.992 --> 01:36:33.660
"I hereby resign
for personal reasons"

01:36:33.728 --> 01:36:35.161
so it was her idea

01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:36.864
to leave her job?

01:36:37.298 --> 01:36:38.399
That's what it says.

01:36:38.466 --> 01:36:40.150
Nothing further.

01:36:40.218 --> 01:36:42.285

MAN: Hello.

01:36:50.579 --> 01:36:55.415
Hi. I'm Jackie Lemancyzk's
brother James.

01:36:55.483 --> 01:36:56.917
Is it possible
to see her?

01:36:56.985 --> 01:36:58.118
James Lemancyzk?

01:36:58.186 --> 01:36:59.419
Yes.

01:36:59.487 --> 01:37:01.254
One minute.

01:37:19.825 --> 01:37:21.859
CLERK: All rise.

01:37:23.829 --> 01:37:26.930
Let me explain,
Miss Lemancyzk.

01:37:26.998 --> 01:37:28.932
I'm really
not your brother.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.601
[Knock On Door]

01:37:33.054 --> 01:37:35.656
Rudy. Good.

01:37:35.723 --> 01:37:38.391
I'd like you to meet
Jackie Lemancyzk.

01:37:46.051 --> 01:37:48.886
This is Jackie Lemancyzk.

01:37:48.954 --> 01:37:52.389
Where she goes,
Carl goes.

01:37:53.992 --> 01:37:55.626

This is my partner,

01:37:55.694 --> 01:37:57.461
Rudy S. Baylor.

01:37:57.528 --> 01:37:59.763
Just tell him
what you told me.

01:37:59.831 --> 01:38:01.865
Miss Lemancyzk.

01:38:01.933 --> 01:38:03.701
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

01:38:03.768 --> 01:38:05.836
Is it all right
if I sit down?

01:38:05.904 --> 01:38:07.104
Sure, sure.

01:38:07.171 --> 01:38:09.673
All right,
Miss Lemancyzk,

01:38:09.741 --> 01:38:12.342
let's talk
about the Black file.

01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:14.177
It was assigned to you?

01:38:14.245 --> 01:38:16.196
Yes, that's correct.

01:38:16.263 --> 01:38:18.499
The initial claim
from Mrs. Black

01:38:18.566 --> 01:38:19.600
was assigned to me.

01:38:19.667 --> 01:38:21.234
Pursuant to company
policy at the time,

01:38:21.302 --> 01:38:24.070
I sent her
a letter of denial.

01:38:24.138 --> 01:38:25.138
Why?

01:38:25.206 --> 01:38:27.207
Why?

01:38:28.877 --> 01:38:31.211
Because all claims
were initially denied.

01:38:34.816 --> 01:38:36.316
All claims?

01:38:36.384 --> 01:38:38.952
All claims.

01:38:44.358 --> 01:38:47.394
OK, this is how it works.

01:38:47.461 --> 01:38:49.663
The policy...

01:38:49.731 --> 01:38:51.431
Is sold door to door

01:38:51.499 --> 01:38:52.933
in the poorer
neighborhoods.

01:38:53.001 --> 01:38:54.601
Paid in cash

01:38:55.036 --> 01:38:57.187
each week.

01:38:57.255 --> 01:39:02.159
The claim comes in
and is assigned to a handler.

01:39:02.226 --> 01:39:06.497
That's basically
a low level paper pusher.

01:39:06.564 --> 01:39:11.234
Anyway, the handler
reviews it

01:39:11.303 --> 01:39:14.070
and immediately sends
a letter to the insured

01:39:14.138 --> 01:39:15.238
denying the claim.

01:39:15.307 --> 01:39:17.040
The claims handler

01:39:17.108 --> 01:39:20.043
then sends the file
over to underwriting.

01:39:20.111 --> 01:39:22.546
Underwriting sends a memo
back to claims

01:39:22.614 --> 01:39:25.616
saying, "don't pay this
until you hear from us."

01:39:25.817 --> 01:39:28.218
Now, what you should
keep in mind

01:39:28.286 --> 01:39:29.720
is that even though
all these people work

01:39:29.788 --> 01:39:30.754
for this big company,

01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:32.423
and they all work
in the same building,

01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:33.990
they don't know each other.

01:39:34.058 --> 01:39:36.593
Nor do they know what the other
department is up to.

01:39:36.661 --> 01:39:37.761
Now, this is very intentional.

01:39:37.829 --> 01:39:40.030
The departments are kept
at war with each other.

01:39:40.098 --> 01:39:42.199
Now, meanwhile,

01:39:42.266 --> 01:39:45.202
there's the client.

01:39:46.504 --> 01:39:49.473
And they're getting
all these letters.

01:39:49.541 --> 01:39:53.544
Some from claims,
some from underwriting,

01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:56.613
and most people give up.

01:39:58.216 --> 01:40:01.918
And this, of course,
is...

01:40:01.986 --> 01:40:03.787
Intended.

01:40:16.184 --> 01:40:17.684
Your next witness,
Mr. Baylor.

01:40:18.987 --> 01:40:21.088

Objection, your honor.

01:40:29.847 --> 01:40:30.814
Approach the bench?

01:40:30.882 --> 01:40:32.499
You may.

01:40:32.567 --> 01:40:34.451
This is a complete
surprise, your honor.

01:40:34.519 --> 01:40:36.253
Why? She's listed as
a potential witness.

01:40:36.321 --> 01:40:37.371
We have a right
to be forewarned.

01:40:37.438 --> 01:40:38.572
When did you find her?

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.806
I didn't know
she was lost.

01:40:39.874 --> 01:40:41.441
It's a fair question,
Mr. Baylor.

01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:44.010
Well, it's
my first trial.

01:40:44.078 --> 01:40:45.312
That's not good enough.

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:47.631
It is a matter of fairness,
your honor.

01:40:47.699 --> 01:40:49.934
We have a right to be
notified about your witness.

01:40:50.001 --> 01:40:51.301
I agree.

01:40:51.369 --> 01:40:52.770
Are you telling me
she can't testify?

01:40:52.837 --> 01:40:55.539
She's listed in the pretrial
order, your honor.

01:40:55.607 --> 01:40:57.908
Pursuant to rule 26.06,

01:40:57.976 --> 01:41:01.545
we have the right
to call her as a witness.

01:41:03.147 --> 01:41:04.748
Objection overruled.

01:41:10.555 --> 01:41:12.189
Go memorize.

01:41:24.269 --> 01:41:26.303
JUDGE KIPLER: State your name
for the record.

01:41:26.371 --> 01:41:28.138
Jackie Lemancyzk.

01:41:29.007 --> 01:41:29.974
Miss Lemancyzk,

01:41:30.041 --> 01:41:31.942
how long did you work
for Great Benefit?

01:41:32.010 --> 01:41:33.743
6 years.

01:41:33.811 --> 01:41:35.545
And when did
your employment end?

01:41:35.613 --> 01:41:37.647
October 30th.

01:41:37.715 --> 01:41:38.915
How did it end?

01:41:38.984 --> 01:41:40.484
I was fired.

01:41:40.551 --> 01:41:43.120
You mean
you did not resign?

01:41:43.187 --> 01:41:44.989
No, I was fired.

01:41:45.056 --> 01:41:46.690
[Whispers]

01:41:46.758 --> 01:41:48.092
Approach the witness,
your honor?

01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.093
You may.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:50.527
I am baffled,
Miss Lemancyzk,

01:41:50.595 --> 01:41:51.595
because I have
this letter here,

01:41:51.663 --> 01:41:54.564
and it says you quit
for personal reasons.

01:41:54.633 --> 01:41:55.933
The letter is a lie.

01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:58.201
[People Chatter]

01:41:58.269 --> 01:41:59.870
I was fired so the company
could claim

01:41:59.938 --> 01:42:01.872
that I no longer
worked there.

01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:03.807
Can you please point out
the man in the courtroom

01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:05.809
who made you
write this letter?

01:42:13.968 --> 01:42:15.635
Jack Underhall.

01:42:17.605 --> 01:42:20.607
He told me I was leaving
immediately,

01:42:20.674 --> 01:42:22.675
and I had 2 choices...

01:42:22.743 --> 01:42:25.245
I could call it a firing
and leave with nothing,

01:42:25.313 --> 01:42:27.281
or I could write
that letter,

01:42:27.348 --> 01:42:28.848
call it a resignation,

01:42:28.917 --> 01:42:32.185
and the company would
give me $10,000 in cash

01:42:32.253 --> 01:42:34.054
to keep quiet.

01:42:34.122 --> 01:42:36.523
And I had to make
that decision

01:42:36.591 --> 01:42:39.259
right there
in his presence.

01:42:41.663 --> 01:42:43.630
[Whispering]

01:42:43.698 --> 01:42:44.864
BAYLOR:
Go on.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.335
I took the cash...

01:42:49.637 --> 01:42:52.205
And I also signed a letter
saying I would never discuss

01:42:52.273 --> 01:42:54.274
any of my claims files
with anybody.

01:42:54.342 --> 01:42:56.343
Including
the Black file?

01:42:56.411 --> 01:42:58.429
Specifically the Black file.

01:42:58.496 --> 01:43:02.199
So you knew that claim
should have been paid?

01:43:03.785 --> 01:43:05.352
Everybody knew...

01:43:06.687 --> 01:43:09.589
But the company
was playing the odds.

01:43:09.657 --> 01:43:11.458
What odds?

01:43:12.543 --> 01:43:15.779
The odds that the insured
would not consult a lawyer.

01:43:15.847 --> 01:43:17.981
[People Chatter]

01:43:20.735 --> 01:43:22.869
[Dot Crying]

01:43:24.339 --> 01:43:26.473
Now, during that time...

01:43:28.676 --> 01:43:32.045
You were a senior
claims examiner?

01:43:32.112 --> 01:43:33.313
Yes, that's correct.

01:43:33.381 --> 01:43:35.716
During that time, was
there ever an occasion

01:43:35.783 --> 01:43:36.916
when you were given
instructions

01:43:36.984 --> 01:43:39.436
regarding how you should
handle claims?

01:43:39.504 --> 01:43:41.805
Deny all claims for a year.

01:43:41.872 --> 01:43:43.991
Add up the money saved,

01:43:44.058 --> 01:43:46.093
deduct the amount spent
on quick court settlements,

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:48.145
and there's
a pot of gold left.

01:43:48.213 --> 01:43:49.412
Approach the clerk,
your honor?

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.447
JUDGE KIPLER:
You may.

01:43:50.514 --> 01:43:51.414
Thank you.

01:43:51.482 --> 01:43:53.150
Number 6, please.

01:43:54.352 --> 01:43:55.719
Here's what has
heretofore been marked

01:43:55.786 --> 01:43:58.021
defense exhibit
number 6.

01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:00.624
Do you
recognize this?

01:44:00.691 --> 01:44:03.693
Yes. It's a Great Benefits
company claims manual.

01:44:05.062 --> 01:44:06.130
Would you do me a favor

01:44:06.197 --> 01:44:10.267
and just flip over
to section "U," please?

01:44:13.838 --> 01:44:16.640
There is
no section "U."

01:44:16.707 --> 01:44:18.342
But do you remember
a section "U"

01:44:18.409 --> 01:44:20.344
when you were a senior
claims examiner?

01:44:21.379 --> 01:44:23.180
Yes, I do.

01:44:23.248 --> 01:44:26.082
Section "U" was
an executive memorandum

01:44:26.151 --> 01:44:28.685
in the senior
examiners manual.

01:44:28.753 --> 01:44:30.320
Thank you.

01:44:30.388 --> 01:44:32.256
Your honor,

01:44:32.323 --> 01:44:35.759
this is Jackie Lemancyzk's
actual senior claims manual,

01:44:35.826 --> 01:44:37.561
and within it, there is
an executive memorandum

01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:38.928
entitled section "U."

01:44:38.996 --> 01:44:39.996
I ask that I might
approach...

01:44:40.064 --> 01:44:42.232
objection, your honor.
Approach the bench?

01:44:43.984 --> 01:44:47.103
Your honor, we were not
given a complete manual.

01:44:47.172 --> 01:44:48.405
Your honor,
this document contains

01:44:48.473 --> 01:44:50.607
executive memoranda
that are stolen work papers

01:44:50.675 --> 01:44:52.008
and may not be admitted.

01:44:52.076 --> 01:44:52.759
May not be admitted?

01:44:52.827 --> 01:44:54.027
Can you prove this, Leo?

01:44:54.094 --> 01:44:56.430
Your honor, I ask that you
instruct my colleague here

01:44:56.497 --> 01:44:57.497
not to read from

01:44:57.565 --> 01:44:59.783
nor to make reference
to any suspect...

01:44:59.851 --> 01:45:03.386
I don't understand
why this is not admissible.

01:45:03.454 --> 01:45:05.088
It was not proffered
at the correct time,

01:45:05.156 --> 01:45:06.290
nor do we know
how it was obtained...

01:45:06.357 --> 01:45:08.192
I just found out
about this last night.

01:45:08.259 --> 01:45:10.176
Assuming that I can't
get this in now,

01:45:10.244 --> 01:45:12.045
do you have any more
questions for the witness?

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.846
No, your honor.

01:45:13.914 --> 01:45:16.649
You may cross-examine,
Mr. Drummond.

01:45:16.717 --> 01:45:18.351
Thank you.

01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:34.852
Is it true,
Miss Lemancyzk...

01:45:35.803 --> 01:45:38.438
That you have recently
been committed

01:45:38.506 --> 01:45:40.440
to an institution
for various problems?

01:45:40.508 --> 01:45:42.642
I was not committed.

01:45:42.710 --> 01:45:45.878
I am suffering from
alcoholism and depression,

01:45:45.946 --> 01:45:49.382
and I voluntarily
checked into a facility.

01:45:49.450 --> 01:45:51.284
I was supposed
to be covered

01:45:51.352 --> 01:45:53.553
by my group policy
at Great Benefit,

01:45:53.621 --> 01:45:56.039
and they, of course,
are denying my claim.

01:45:56.107 --> 01:45:57.974
Is that why you're here,
Miss Lemancyzk?

01:45:58.042 --> 01:46:00.410
Because you're angry
with Great Benefit?

01:46:00.478 --> 01:46:01.445
Miss Lemancyzk?

01:46:01.512 --> 01:46:04.114
I hate Great Benefit

01:46:04.181 --> 01:46:06.950
and most of the worms
that work there.

01:46:07.017 --> 01:46:09.253
Did you feel
Mr. Lufkin was a worm

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.954
when you were
sleeping with him?

01:46:11.922 --> 01:46:14.023
Objection.

01:46:14.091 --> 01:46:15.292
Your honor,

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.628
Mr. Drummond might find this
fun to talk about,

01:46:17.695 --> 01:46:19.896
but this is
not relevant at all.

01:46:19.964 --> 01:46:21.831
Oh, there's
no fun for me.

01:46:21.899 --> 01:46:23.300
Overruled.

01:46:23.368 --> 01:46:24.601
Let's see
where this takes us.

01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:29.239
DRUMMOND: You admit to having
an affair with Mr. Lufkin?

01:46:35.262 --> 01:46:38.064
Miss Lemancyzk?

01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:47.424
As long as I had sex
with certain executives

01:46:47.491 --> 01:46:49.960
at Great Benefit,

01:46:50.028 --> 01:46:54.364
my pay was increased,
and I was promoted.

01:46:54.432 --> 01:46:57.350
Lemancyzk: When I stopped,
I was demoted.

01:46:57.418 --> 01:46:58.919
DRUMMOND:
Miss Lemancyzk,

01:46:58.986 --> 01:47:00.820
as an employee
of Great Benefit,

01:47:00.888 --> 01:47:02.722
you promised
not to disclose

01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:05.124
confidential private
claims information.

01:47:05.193 --> 01:47:06.626
Yes?
Yes.

01:47:06.694 --> 01:47:08.061
In fact, you testified

01:47:08.128 --> 01:47:10.880
that you sealed
that promise

01:47:10.948 --> 01:47:13.950
by demand of payment
for $10,000, didn't you?

01:47:14.018 --> 01:47:15.919
That payment
was not my idea.

01:47:15.986 --> 01:47:17.521
But you accepted it,
didn't you?

01:47:17.588 --> 01:47:19.523
You put it right
in your pocketbook.

01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:20.824
Even though
in your mind,

01:47:20.891 --> 01:47:22.992
you never intended
to keep that promise.

01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:25.629
In fact,
you were very angry

01:47:25.697 --> 01:47:28.131
at Great Benefit and
Mr. Lufkin, weren't you?

01:47:28.199 --> 01:47:30.133
You know,
they preyed on me,

01:47:30.201 --> 01:47:32.402
because I was broke,
and I was single,

01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:33.870
and I had 2 kids.

01:47:33.938 --> 01:47:35.639
So you told him you're
gonna go to his wife,

01:47:35.707 --> 01:47:36.640
go to the newspapers.

01:47:36.708 --> 01:47:37.774
And that $10,000,

01:47:37.842 --> 01:47:40.009
that was just a piece
of blackmail, wasn't it?

01:47:40.077 --> 01:47:43.313
A way to extort money
from the company you hated!

01:47:43.381 --> 01:47:44.514
Isn't that right?

01:47:44.582 --> 01:47:45.832
No, that's not true.

01:47:45.899 --> 01:47:48.051
In fact, your testimony
here today is just a lie.

01:47:48.119 --> 01:47:49.719
You stole
company work papers,

01:47:49.787 --> 01:47:53.056
confidential reports
as blackmail for revenge.

01:47:53.124 --> 01:47:57.527
Hell hath no fury
as what, Miss Lemancyzk?

01:47:57.595 --> 01:48:00.730
A woman scorned!

01:48:00.798 --> 01:48:03.766
Your honor, I move
that all documents

01:48:03.834 --> 01:48:07.004
provided the plaintiff
by Miss Jackie Lemancyzk

01:48:07.071 --> 01:48:08.938
be deemed
stolen work papers

01:48:09.007 --> 01:48:10.840
and struck
from these proceedings.

01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:23.420
Based on the evidence
presently before the court,

01:48:23.488 --> 01:48:25.188
these documents
are inadmissible.

01:48:25.256 --> 01:48:26.390
Ohh.

01:48:30.194 --> 01:48:31.728
No further questions.

01:48:31.796 --> 01:48:33.397
KIPLER:
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

01:48:33.464 --> 01:48:35.198
Mr. Baylor.

01:48:37.535 --> 01:48:39.703
You may step down,
Miss Lemancyzk.

01:48:47.227 --> 01:48:48.995
I'm sorry.

01:49:03.844 --> 01:49:05.095
MAN: Hello.

01:49:05.162 --> 01:49:06.862
Hi. This is Deck Schifflet.

01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:08.931
I need to speak to big rhino.
Can you connect me?

01:49:08.999 --> 01:49:11.167
Big rhino?
Just a second.

01:49:11.235 --> 01:49:12.402
OK.

01:49:17.307 --> 01:49:18.374
Hello?

01:49:18.442 --> 01:49:19.909
Hey, boss, it's deck.

01:49:19.977 --> 01:49:21.444
Oh, hey, deck,
how you doing?

01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:22.612
Good. How are you?

01:49:22.679 --> 01:49:23.747
Well, I'm cool.

01:49:23.814 --> 01:49:25.548
Are you here?

01:49:25.616 --> 01:49:27.083
Well,
I'm here and there.

01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:29.252
Ah, yeah,
here and there.

01:49:29.319 --> 01:49:33.489
Listen, I got
a stolen-evidence situation.

01:49:33.557 --> 01:49:36.692
OK. Stolen evidence,
uh...

01:49:36.761 --> 01:49:38.494
Let me see, uh...

01:49:38.562 --> 01:49:40.997
OK. The De Soto case.

01:49:41.065 --> 01:49:42.031
De Soto?

01:49:42.099 --> 01:49:45.534
Carmine De Soto.
You remember him?

01:49:45.602 --> 01:49:46.502
Club Ruby.

01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:47.937
Uh-huh.

01:49:48.005 --> 01:49:49.939
Where... where do I find that?

01:49:50.007 --> 01:49:53.443
Uh, around '92,
you'll find it, uh,

01:49:53.511 --> 01:49:55.911
let's see,
650 something, uh...

01:49:55.979 --> 01:49:57.347
Southwest second.

01:49:57.414 --> 01:49:58.814
Boss, you're a lifesaver.

01:49:58.882 --> 01:49:59.815
'92?

01:49:59.883 --> 01:50:01.518
Yeah. Club Ruby case.

01:50:01.585 --> 01:50:03.419
'92...

01:50:03.487 --> 01:50:04.521
Carmine De Soto.

01:50:04.588 --> 01:50:05.655
Carmine De Soto.

01:50:05.722 --> 01:50:06.656
Club Ruby.

01:50:06.723 --> 01:50:07.624
Club Ruby.

01:50:07.691 --> 01:50:08.958
It's from
the appellate court.

01:50:09.026 --> 01:50:10.993
Yeah.
It kind of rings a bell.

01:50:15.349 --> 01:50:16.315
I got it!

01:50:16.383 --> 01:50:18.451
And from Bruiser,
of all people.

01:50:18.519 --> 01:50:20.453
Bruiser? I thought you didn't
know where Bruiser was.

01:50:20.521 --> 01:50:23.489
Well, I don't, but I got
an emergency-contact number.

01:50:23.558 --> 01:50:25.725
I call them, they get me
in touch with him.

01:50:25.793 --> 01:50:26.993
Look, Rudy,

01:50:27.061 --> 01:50:29.295
nobody knows more than Bruiser
about stolen evidence.

01:50:29.363 --> 01:50:31.297
You might say
it's his stock and trade.

01:50:31.365 --> 01:50:32.465
[Ring]
Hello?

01:50:32.533 --> 01:50:33.833
WOMAN: Mr. Rudy Baylor?

01:50:33.901 --> 01:50:34.801
Yes.

01:50:34.869 --> 01:50:36.570
This is
the Shelby county D.A.

01:50:36.637 --> 01:50:38.071
Can you come
to the courthouse tonight?

01:50:38.138 --> 01:50:40.239
I'd like to discuss
the Kelly Riker case.

01:50:40.307 --> 01:50:41.240
Sure.

01:50:41.308 --> 01:50:42.809
Come to room 6.

01:50:44.545 --> 01:50:47.213
There's an advantage to dealing
with pimps and thieves.

01:50:47.281 --> 01:50:50.249
In the case of <i> Carmine De Soto</i>
<i>vs. The Club Ruby,</i>

01:50:50.317 --> 01:50:52.251
there are reams
of stolen evidence.

01:50:52.319 --> 01:50:54.320
Now, Bruiser worked
on this stuff himself.

01:50:54.388 --> 01:50:56.856
Not now.
I got to go.

01:50:56.924 --> 01:50:58.158
You got to go?

01:50:58.225 --> 01:51:00.660
You got the CEO of Great Benefit
coming in tomorrow.

01:51:00.727 --> 01:51:04.030
We... we got to nail this guy,
come on.

01:51:15.643 --> 01:51:17.143
Good luck, Kelly.

01:51:17.211 --> 01:51:18.745
Thanks.

01:51:23.217 --> 01:51:25.118
I met with the D.A.

01:51:25.185 --> 01:51:27.087
She's not
gonna prosecute.

01:51:27.154 --> 01:51:30.256
Said she'd never
get a conviction.

01:51:30.324 --> 01:51:32.492
It was self-defense,
Kelly.

01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:46.205
DECK: The plaintiff
would like to call

01:51:46.273 --> 01:51:49.125
Wilfred Keeley
to the stand.

01:51:49.193 --> 01:51:50.844
CLERK: Raise your
right hand, please.

01:51:50.911 --> 01:51:52.812
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.047
you're about to give
in this cause

01:51:54.114 --> 01:51:55.481
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

01:51:55.549 --> 01:51:57.450
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:51:57.517 --> 01:51:58.451
I do.

01:51:58.518 --> 01:52:00.353
You may take the stand.

01:52:02.622 --> 01:52:04.924
JUDGE KIPLER: State your name
for the record.

01:52:04.992 --> 01:52:06.192
Wilfred Keeley.

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:08.127
May I approach
the witness, your honor?

01:52:08.195 --> 01:52:09.628
You may.

01:52:09.696 --> 01:52:13.032
Mr. Keeley, uh, in this
Great Benefit brochure,

01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.901
is that you?
Is that your name?

01:52:14.969 --> 01:52:15.902
Yes.

01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:18.271
And what do
those initials stand for?

01:52:18.339 --> 01:52:19.739
CEO?

01:52:19.806 --> 01:52:22.742
Yeah. What do they stand for?
What does "CEO" mean?

01:52:22.809 --> 01:52:24.244
Chief executive officer.

01:52:24.311 --> 01:52:26.545
Chief executive officer.
Thank you, thank you.

01:52:26.613 --> 01:52:29.382
So you're the...
you're the guy.

01:52:29.449 --> 01:52:32.252
You're the main guy,
you're the cheese.

01:52:32.319 --> 01:52:33.987
The buck stops with you.

01:52:34.054 --> 01:52:35.454
You could say that, yes.

01:52:35.522 --> 01:52:36.722
Yeah. OK. Thank you.

01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:39.625
Uh, your honor, I'd like
to turn the questioning

01:52:39.693 --> 01:52:44.497
of Mr. Keeley over
to my partner Rudy Baylor.

01:52:44.564 --> 01:52:46.149
[Whispering]
Are you out of your mind?

01:52:46.216 --> 01:52:47.316
You don't have a license.

01:52:47.384 --> 01:52:49.318
I didn't have a choice.
What are you doing?

01:52:49.386 --> 01:52:50.787
You're late.

01:52:50.855 --> 01:52:52.155
Good morning, your honor.

01:52:52.222 --> 01:52:54.190
Sorry I'm late, sir.

01:52:54.258 --> 01:52:56.559
Approach the witness,
your honor?

01:52:56.627 --> 01:52:58.361
You may.

01:52:58.429 --> 01:53:00.062
This is the claims manual

01:53:00.130 --> 01:53:02.064
that was given to me
by Jackie Lemancyzk.

01:53:02.132 --> 01:53:03.065
DRUMMOND: Objection,
your honor.

01:53:03.133 --> 01:53:04.634
Stolen work papers.
Inadmissible.

01:53:04.702 --> 01:53:05.635
You ruled on this.

01:53:05.703 --> 01:53:06.869
KIPLER: Sustained.

01:53:06.937 --> 01:53:08.338
May we approach?

01:53:12.643 --> 01:53:14.711
DRUMMOND: I thought this matter
was already settled, your honor.

01:53:14.779 --> 01:53:16.713
RUDY: Your honor,
I just this morning

01:53:16.781 --> 01:53:18.315
found a case
that is controlled

01:53:18.382 --> 01:53:19.716
in this
factual situation.

01:53:19.784 --> 01:53:21.150
JUDGE KIPLER:
What do you have?

01:53:21.218 --> 01:53:23.720
If you'll just take
a look at this ruling.

01:53:23.788 --> 01:53:26.356
It's <i> Club Ruby</i>
<i>vs. Carmine De Soto.</i>

01:53:26.424 --> 01:53:28.825
Copy for your honor
and one for Mr. Drummond.

01:53:28.892 --> 01:53:31.861
Number 585,
southwest second, page 431,

01:53:31.929 --> 01:53:34.698
argued by Bruiser...
by J. Lyman Stone.

01:53:34.765 --> 01:53:35.998
And it shows very clearly

01:53:36.066 --> 01:53:38.100
that stolen documents
are, in fact, admissible

01:53:38.168 --> 01:53:40.870
if the lawyers played
no part in the theft.

01:53:40.938 --> 01:53:43.623
Well, according
to these head notes,

01:53:43.691 --> 01:53:46.292
this case will overrule
your objection.

01:53:46.359 --> 01:53:47.660
Sorry, Leo.

01:53:47.727 --> 01:53:50.696
Oh, I'm sure you are,
your honor.

01:53:50.764 --> 01:53:52.498
But note
my strong objection.

01:53:52.566 --> 01:53:53.699
Objection noted.

01:53:53.767 --> 01:53:55.685

01:53:55.753 --> 01:53:57.086
Do so.

01:53:58.922 --> 01:54:01.440
Uh... Your honor...

01:54:01.508 --> 01:54:03.977
Your honor, I'm sorry.

01:54:04.044 --> 01:54:06.329
Excuse the interruption,
Mr. Keeley.

01:54:06.396 --> 01:54:08.264
We were about
to talk about

01:54:08.332 --> 01:54:10.366
the Great Benefit
claims manual.

01:54:10.434 --> 01:54:14.670
Is that a complete Great Benefit
claims manual, sir?

01:54:16.473 --> 01:54:17.607
Yes.

01:54:17.674 --> 01:54:19.843
Does it have
a section "U"?

01:54:24.215 --> 01:54:27.851
KEELEY: It has
a section "U" in it.

01:54:27.918 --> 01:54:29.953
Well, let's talk about
this mysterious section "U."

01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:31.988
Why don't we explain it
to the jury?

01:54:32.056 --> 01:54:33.923
Take a look at it.

01:54:35.025 --> 01:54:36.993
Just read paragraph 3.

01:54:41.081 --> 01:54:44.367
"Claim handlers are directed
to deny all claims

01:54:44.435 --> 01:54:47.003
"within 3 days
of receipt of claim.

01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:48.337
No exceptions."

01:54:48.406 --> 01:54:51.274
Now, how do you explain
this section "U"?

01:54:51.341 --> 01:54:54.444
Well, sometimes
we get some frivolous

01:54:54.512 --> 01:54:58.014
and fraudulent claims
in our business,

01:54:58.081 --> 01:55:00.483
and sometimes we have to use
this kind of language

01:55:00.551 --> 01:55:02.819
to focus in on
the legitimate

01:55:02.887 --> 01:55:05.154
and more needy claims.

01:55:06.557 --> 01:55:09.225
Mr. Keeley, do you honestly
expect this court

01:55:09.293 --> 01:55:11.394
to believe that explanation?

01:55:11.396 --> 01:55:12.812
Well, this chapter
merely denotes

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:15.815
in-house
processing guidelines.

01:55:15.883 --> 01:55:17.349
In-house
<i>processing</i> guidelines.

01:55:17.417 --> 01:55:19.652
No, Mr. Keeley.
No, it does not.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.487
Section "U" does
a lot more than that.

01:55:21.555 --> 01:55:23.322
I don't think
it does that, son.

01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:25.658
Mr. Keeley, doesn't it
explain precisely

01:55:25.726 --> 01:55:28.194
how claims should be routed
and shuffled and rerouted,

01:55:28.261 --> 01:55:30.262
anything to avoid payment?

01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:31.397
I admit nothing.

01:55:31.464 --> 01:55:32.832
Your honor,
approach the witness?

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.250
You may.

Now, Mr. Keeley,

01:55:40.758 --> 01:55:44.727
how many policies did
Great Benefit have in effect

01:55:44.795 --> 01:55:48.598
in the year 1995?

01:55:51.635 --> 01:55:53.903
I don't know.

01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:55.538
Well, let's see.

01:55:57.374 --> 01:56:01.978
Does the figure 98,000 sound
correct, give or take a few?

01:56:02.996 --> 01:56:04.530
Maybe.

01:56:04.598 --> 01:56:06.399
That could be right,
yeah.

01:56:06.467 --> 01:56:07.633
Thank you.

01:56:07.701 --> 01:56:11.370
Now, of these policies,
how many claims were filed?

01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:15.908
Well, I don't...
I don't know that.

01:56:15.976 --> 01:56:19.312
Does the figure of 11,400
sound correct to you,

01:56:19.379 --> 01:56:21.013
give or take a few?

01:56:21.081 --> 01:56:22.882
That's about right,

01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:26.753
but I'd have to
verify it, of course.

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.354
I see. So the information
that I want

01:56:28.421 --> 01:56:29.789
is right there in that book?

01:56:29.857 --> 01:56:30.757
Yes.

01:56:30.824 --> 01:56:32.158
Can you tell the jury

01:56:32.226 --> 01:56:34.577
of the 11 some odd thousand
claims filed,

01:56:34.645 --> 01:56:36.546
how many were denied?

01:56:38.632 --> 01:56:41.567
I don't think I could.
That would take more time.

01:56:41.635 --> 01:56:43.702
You've had 2 months,
Mr. Keeley.

01:56:43.770 --> 01:56:45.671

of air and slowly dying...

02:00:22.472 --> 02:00:25.608

with myself...

And with the entire
legal profession

02:00:27.711 --> 02:00:29.311
that could not save him.

02:00:29.379 --> 02:00:33.582
I don't even feel good enough
about myself as a lawyer

02:00:33.650 --> 02:00:35.651
to make my own summation.

02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:43.158

I'd let Donny Ray do that.

I was in the hospital
being treated

02:01:09.269 --> 02:01:10.903
that the only thing
that could save my life

02:01:10.971 --> 02:01:13.673
would be
a bone-marrow transplant.

02:01:15.175 --> 02:01:20.179
So, I got released
from the hospital,

02:01:20.247 --> 02:01:23.148
'cause my family
couldn't afford to pay

02:01:23.217 --> 02:01:25.201

they had recommended.

02:01:25.268 --> 02:01:26.401

denied our claim.

a 90% chance of living.

astonished...

As I am,

02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:55.130

a legitimate claim.

so much money on their lawyers

02:05:03.336 --> 02:05:07.172
We get 1/3, but the money's
not in the bank yet.

02:05:08.074 --> 02:05:09.508
I'll see you later.

02:05:09.576 --> 02:05:11.510
You gonna leave
this girl all alone?

02:05:11.578 --> 02:05:13.145
Not for long.

02:05:14.614 --> 02:05:17.349
Rudy. Rudy.

02:05:17.417 --> 02:05:20.719
I've decided I'm gonna
put your name in my will.

02:05:20.787 --> 02:05:22.020
Oh. You know what?

02:05:22.088 --> 02:05:25.324
You are just too kind
to me, Miss Birdie.

02:05:29.178 --> 02:05:30.946
Hot off the newswire.

02:05:31.013 --> 02:05:35.584
"Mr. Wilfred Keeley,
CEO of Great Benefit,

02:05:35.652 --> 02:05:38.120
"was detained
yesterday afternoon at JFK

02:05:38.187 --> 02:05:41.189
"just after boarding a flight
bound for Heathrow.

02:05:41.258 --> 02:05:42.658
"Traveling with his wife,

02:05:42.726 --> 02:05:45.561
"they claimed to be sneaking
away for a quick holiday.

02:05:45.629 --> 02:05:47.763
"However, they could not
produce the name of a hotel

02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:48.930
anywhere in Europe..."

02:05:48.998 --> 02:05:50.266
At which they were expected.

02:05:50.333 --> 02:05:53.034
At 5 P.M. today,
insurance company Great Benefit

02:05:53.103 --> 02:05:55.036
filed for protection
under the bankruptcy code

02:05:55.105 --> 02:05:56.605
in federal court
in Cleveland.

02:05:56.673 --> 02:05:59.408
Many states are now
investigating Great Benefit,

02:05:59.476 --> 02:06:01.894
and a number of class-action
lawsuits have been filed.

02:06:01.962 --> 02:06:04.396
[Telephone Rings]

02:06:04.464 --> 02:06:05.898
Hello?

02:06:05.966 --> 02:06:08.917
Rudy, Leo Drummond here.

02:06:08.985 --> 02:06:13.522
It appears the company's
been looted.

02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:15.557
I'm... I'm sorry, Rudy.

02:06:15.625 --> 02:06:18.893
I wanted you to get
every penny of that money.

02:06:18.961 --> 02:06:21.881
Everybody loses
on this one.

02:06:21.948 --> 02:06:24.082
Wanted you to know.

02:06:25.251 --> 02:06:27.085
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

02:06:28.321 --> 02:06:30.538
Great Benefit's like
a bad slot machine...

02:06:30.606 --> 02:06:33.142
never pays off.

02:06:33.209 --> 02:06:35.177
We should have
taken 175,000.

02:06:35.245 --> 02:06:38.346
What the hell
were we thinking?

02:06:42.385 --> 02:06:44.386
It just got all
twisted, didn't it?

02:06:44.453 --> 02:06:47.322
This legal profession.

02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:48.440
RUDY:
Every lawyer in America

02:06:48.507 --> 02:06:50.842
is talking about me
right now,

02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:52.177
but that doesn't exactly
make me feel

02:06:52.244 --> 02:06:55.380
like a member
of the legal community.

02:06:55.448 --> 02:06:57.348
I might be able
to go on practicing law

02:06:57.416 --> 02:06:59.851
if I was working
with my whole heart,

02:06:59.919 --> 02:07:01.853
but I can't do that
and cover Kelly.

02:07:01.921 --> 02:07:06.625
And she's gonna need
a lot of cover for a while.

02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:10.779
I still love the law.
I'll always love it,

02:07:10.847 --> 02:07:13.148
but maybe I should be
teaching it

02:07:13.216 --> 02:07:16.452
instead of practicing it
out here in the world.

02:07:16.519 --> 02:07:18.653
I need time to work it out.

02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:21.323
Great Benefit
has gone belly up.

02:07:22.825 --> 02:07:25.461
Barring a miracle
way off in the distance,

02:07:25.528 --> 02:07:27.129
we won't get a dime.

02:07:27.197 --> 02:07:29.314
God.

02:07:29.382 --> 02:07:31.683
You've put them
out of business, Dot.

02:07:31.751 --> 02:07:34.720
One little woman
from Memphis, Tennessee,

02:07:34.787 --> 02:07:37.956
bankrupted them
sons of bitches?

02:07:38.023 --> 02:07:39.023
Oh.

02:07:39.091 --> 02:07:40.659
[Chuckles]

02:07:40.727 --> 02:07:43.362
I'm gonna go to Donny Ray's
grave tomorrow

02:07:43.429 --> 02:07:45.597
and tell him all about it.

02:07:51.504 --> 02:07:54.156
RUDY:
So, I guess Kelly and I

02:07:54.224 --> 02:07:58.327
will be taking off
first thing in the morning.

02:07:58.395 --> 02:08:00.496
We made history, Rudy.

02:08:01.898 --> 02:08:03.332
You know that?

02:08:05.935 --> 02:08:07.969
We can always brag.

02:08:09.972 --> 02:08:11.473
Bye.

02:08:12.542 --> 02:08:14.276
RUDY: There's no doubt
about it... I'm hot.

02:08:14.344 --> 02:08:16.412
In fact, I'm so hot
after this case,

02:08:16.479 --> 02:08:19.281
there's no place for me
to go but down.

02:08:19.348 --> 02:08:20.382
See ya.

02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:22.785
Every client I ever have
will expect this...

02:08:22.852 --> 02:08:25.987
the same magic,
nothing less.

02:08:26.055 --> 02:08:28.490
And I could probably
give it to them,

02:08:28.558 --> 02:08:31.176
if it didn't matter
how I did it.

02:08:31.243 --> 02:08:32.510
And then one morning,

02:08:32.578 --> 02:08:36.381
I'd wake up and find
that I'd become Leo Drummond.

02:08:36.448 --> 02:08:40.919
Now, you give me a call
when you pass the bar exam.

02:08:40.987 --> 02:08:43.288
Yeah, piece of cake!

02:08:45.591 --> 02:08:48.459
Every lawyer,
at least once in every case,

02:08:48.527 --> 02:08:51.730
feels himself crossing a line
he doesn't really mean to cross.

02:08:51.798 --> 02:08:52.864
It just happens.

02:08:52.932 --> 02:08:54.933
And if you cross it
enough times,

02:08:55.001 --> 02:08:57.035
it disappears forever.

02:08:58.204 --> 02:09:00.906
And then you're nothing
but another lawyer joke,

02:09:00.973 --> 02:09:04.076
just another shark
in the dirty water.
