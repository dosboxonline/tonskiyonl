[man 1] Everything for his future
depended on this special.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.421
Elvis was at the low point of his career,

00:46.504 --> 00:49.215
doing movies he didn't wanna do.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.638
He hadn't been onstage in seven years.

[man 2] You all know what we're here for,
right? The Elvis Presley Special.

01:01.186 --> 01:05.774
[man 1] The '68 Comeback Special
would let him know

01:05.857 --> 01:09.611
if there was still an audience
for him as a performer.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.696
[tense music continues]

01:13.990 --> 01:18.870
[Schilling] If Elvis did not give
the greatest performance of his career,

01:19.496 --> 01:20.789
it was the end.

first came on the scene,

it was as cool as it possibly gets.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.188
But it evolved to a thing in the '60s.

01:45.271 --> 01:49.359
He was doing music that wasn't as great
as the music he did in the very beginning.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.570
He was doing movies
that nobody believed in.

you ever had.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.865

01:55.949 --> 01:58.493
[Robertson] He was walking a fine line

01:58.576 --> 02:00.912
between, "I'm the real thing,"

02:01.621 --> 02:03.665
or, "I've lost it."

02:06.751 --> 02:11.214
We are now gonna see
whether he's really back or not.

[man 4] Just before they come onstage,

02:21.558 --> 02:24.727
Elvis calls the director
into the dressing room

02:24.811 --> 02:27.438
and said, "I can't go out there.
I can't do it."

02:28.648 --> 02:30.275
And the audience were coming in.

02:32.026 --> 02:32.986
Glenn?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.155
Go?

02:35.238 --> 02:38.158
Okay. Now, y'all know
what we're here for, right?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.702
And the director says, "Look, Elvis."

02:41.536 --> 02:44.289
"You've got to go out there."
Elvis is in the leather jacket.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.374
[somber music playing]

02:47.917 --> 02:50.420
[Luhrmann] And the director says,
"I'll tell you what."

02:50.503 --> 02:52.046
"You go out there,

02:52.130 --> 02:55.049
and if you don't like it,
I'll pretend the tapes were destroyed."

02:55.133 --> 02:57.135
And he makes him this crazy promise.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.555
And so, Elvis goes out.

and that would be it.

It could ruin his career.

It's getting embarrassing standing
out here, Steve. I gotta do something.

-[Elvis] No, but we'll try anyway.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.270

My mother and dad both loved to sing.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.154
They'd tell me
that when I was 3 or 4 years old,

06:45.238 --> 06:47.782
I got away from them in church
and walked up in front of the choir

06:47.865 --> 06:49.283
and started beating time.

06:49.784 --> 06:53.121
You have to remember, back in those days,
music is very segregated.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.665
Most music that we heard was all Black.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.125
And it was rhythm and blues,

B.B. King, Little Richard.

…and we really wasn't interested
in that kind of music.

07:07.635 --> 07:13.683

of Black culture infecting

07:14.434 --> 07:15.393
white children.

07:17.103 --> 07:22.108
And here comes Elvis,
who took the music and the moves

07:22.191 --> 07:27.238
that he saw in the juke joints of
the Mississippi and Memphis of his youth,

07:28.030 --> 07:31.075
the music he grew up loving,
and put that onstage.

07:33.369 --> 07:38.124
[Schilling] This gave us our own music
that was not our parents' music.

I asked him, "How did you come about
really loving Black people's music?"

08:06.652 --> 08:09.655
He said he would go around
to Black churches

08:09.739 --> 08:13.034
and just stand at the windows
and listen to their music.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.204
[congregation singing indistinctly]

08:16.287 --> 08:18.623
[Robertson] He was a prime example

08:18.706 --> 08:21.292
of showing what happens

08:21.375 --> 08:25.755
when you put together
music coming down from the mountains

08:25.838 --> 08:28.841

08:28.925 --> 08:30.551

08:53.115 --> 08:56.410
That was the controversy
that everybody was having at that time.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.956
'Cause his fans
didn't want him to be Black,

09:00.540 --> 09:04.210
and I don't even think they realized
that's the kind of singing he was doing.

09:04.293 --> 09:07.713
But we, as Black artists
and Black singers,

09:07.797 --> 09:10.800
we could tell the difference between Elvis

[Thompson] Elvis was an ambitious artist.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.363
He was also a child
who grew up in poverty,

09:32.446 --> 09:35.908
whose greatest fear was being poor again.

that America would worship.

he saw B.B. King.

of the same person could never coexist,

And basically, they got on
the same package tour together,

he was deeply sensitive

24:45.150 --> 24:48.487
Like that little boy who was ashamed
of what happened to his dad,

24:48.570 --> 24:50.197

24:50.280 --> 24:53.074

and always wanted to please people.

24:56.953 --> 24:59.080
I mean, he was a profound pleaser,

24:59.164 --> 25:01.750
and that made him so charismatic onstage,

25:01.833 --> 25:04.044

the more you need.

on the planet.

01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:04.051
He comes out
and he's wearing that leather suit,

01:11:04.134 --> 01:11:08.097
and he's got those cheekbones
that are off a Greek statue.

he hasn't been in front of people

All the insecurities that he would have,

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:31.245
he's holding himself up
for possible ridicule.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:36.166
This is supposed to be an informal section
of the show where we faint

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.669
or do whatever we want to do.
Especially me.

01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:42.589
[O'Brien] Yes, the guy in
the crazy outfits, and the hip shaking,

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:45.676
and the big hair, is very shy,

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:47.886

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:50.973
We don't have our full band here tonight,
but we'd like to…

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:56.145
we'd like to give you an idea of how we…
How I started out about 14 years ago.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.646
Uh…

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:00.774
And the sound that we had back then.

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:04.987
And the guy over here on my left
is the guy that played guitar for me

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:08.407
when I first started out in 1912.
Nineteen…

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.369
[Thompson] The show
isn't just Elvis's return.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:15.873
I mean, the show is Elvis literally
getting the band back together.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:19.543
This is Scotty Moore, my guitar player.

01:12:20.544 --> 01:12:23.005
[Thompson] That's his band
when he was still a country singer.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:25.591
That's the band
when he was on the Louisiana Hayride.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.926
That's the band
when he was playing in the Opry.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.721
This is my drummer.
He's from Shreveport, Louisiana.

01:12:30.804 --> 01:12:34.016

You were watching musicians
who love each other,

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:43.108

who have come back to each other

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:45.069

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:48.739
The first thing that we recorded,
we had a guitar, a bass,
