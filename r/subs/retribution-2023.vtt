everything she's ever
dreamed of.

We're the same.

- I can't.

They think I'm the bomber.

Then tell them you're not.
Tell them about the guy
on the phone.

I'll try.

My daughter's hurt.
She's lost a lot of blood.

You've got
everybody's attention, Matt.

01:03:51.399 --> 01:03:54.404
A lot of people here
are worried about you.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.906
Especially Heather.

01:03:57.139 --> 01:03:58.973
She just wants
to see her family again,

01:03:59.109 --> 01:04:00.570
and I want
to make sure she does.

01:04:01.745 --> 01:04:03.947
I'm here to help you.

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:08.180
I just need to know
you're not gonna,

01:04:08.315 --> 01:04:10.718
you know,
do something crazy.

01:04:10.853 --> 01:04:13.517
I mean, you go, I go.

01:04:19.427 --> 01:04:22.031
- And I have a family too.
- [Zach] Hey...

01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:25.031
My Dad didn't do
any of this, okay?

01:04:25.166 --> 01:04:26.462
There's this psycho
on the phone

01:04:26.598 --> 01:04:29.005
- talking into his ear.
- [Angela] Zach...

01:04:30.773 --> 01:04:32.338
You see all that?

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:35.312
I have a lot going on here.

01:04:35.447 --> 01:04:38.012
I'm just gonna
talk to your dad here
for a minute, okay?

01:04:38.148 --> 01:04:40.917
I promise
I'll talk to you too.

01:04:41.053 --> 01:04:44.948
Zach, it's okay.
I... I didn't do this.

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:46.417
I wouldn't.

01:04:46.553 --> 01:04:49.284
Matt. Can I call you Matt,
Mr. Turner?

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.924
Call me whatever you want.

01:04:51.059 --> 01:04:53.259
Just get us out of this car.

01:04:53.394 --> 01:04:55.290
Your children
can get out right now

01:04:55.426 --> 01:04:57.699
if that's all right, Matt.

01:04:57.834 --> 01:04:59.629
The car will explode.

01:05:00.732 --> 01:05:03.006
I see. If they get out,
the car explodes.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:15.748
Under our seats,
there are pressure triggers.

01:05:15.883 --> 01:05:18.481
Well, our friends here
are looking into that,
aren't they?

01:05:18.617 --> 01:05:21.486
You turned off the phones,
yeah?

01:05:31.634 --> 01:05:34.229
We've jammed cell signal
for five blocks.
You should be honored.

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:35.797
They haven't interrupted

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:39.372
the telephone service
in Berlin since 1945.

01:05:41.076 --> 01:05:42.639
Nice to unplug for a minute.

01:05:50.654 --> 01:05:52.154
[beeping]

01:05:54.752 --> 01:05:57.588
You say that he
called you on that?

01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:00.490
Do you know who he is?

01:06:00.626 --> 01:06:02.895
If I knew that,
I would tell you.

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:04.899
Just get them out.

01:06:05.034 --> 01:06:06.696
Look at my daughter, please.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.141
Okay. [speaks German]

01:06:14.045 --> 01:06:15.743
They think
the doors are clear.

01:06:15.879 --> 01:06:17.245
We'd like to open them.

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:24.054

01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:43.403
[officer grunts]

01:06:46.011 --> 01:06:48.174
So, three colleagues
from your company

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.074
die in one day,
but not you.

01:06:50.977 --> 01:06:53.715
I didn't do this.
I didn't set off
those bombs.

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.415
Okay. Understood.

01:06:56.347 --> 01:06:57.813
[both chuckle]

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:00.256
It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:02.118
[Angela] But why would
someone do this to you?

01:07:02.253 --> 01:07:03.757
- I'll have a look
under your seat now.
- Why you, Matt?

01:07:03.893 --> 01:07:05.627
To punish you?

01:07:05.762 --> 01:07:07.626
- [Matt] Money.
- You can get money
robbing a bank...

01:07:07.761 --> 01:07:12.767
- [whirring]
- ...or working
a fancy job like yours.

01:07:12.903 --> 01:07:14.203
Not this kind of money.

01:07:16.136 --> 01:07:17.668
What kind of money?

01:07:23.575 --> 01:07:26.479
Trust, Matt.
I need trust.

01:07:27.979 --> 01:07:30.547
You've had a lot of losses
for your clients,

01:07:30.682 --> 01:07:32.115
but you still have
a nice car.

01:07:32.251 --> 01:07:34.256
[scoffs] Do I?

01:07:36.358 --> 01:07:38.323
Well, I guess
you've had a tough day.

01:07:38.459 --> 01:07:40.691
A tough week?
A tough year?

01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:44.767
How much did your clients
lose this year?

01:07:44.902 --> 01:07:47.229
We all lost this year.

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.439
Well, I know that you
and your recent colleagues

01:07:51.574 --> 01:07:53.875
lost a lot of money
for your trusting clients

01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:55.845
who invested in your fund,

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:58.740
yet you kept
making promises.

01:07:58.876 --> 01:08:02.383
Promises
that profits would appear.

01:08:03.614 --> 01:08:05.381
Maybe he's an angry client.

01:08:05.516 --> 01:08:07.520
"An angry client." Mm.

01:08:07.655 --> 01:08:10.826
What kind of money
did you say he wanted?

01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:12.662
Just hurry up, please.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:13.856
What kind of money?

01:08:15.228 --> 01:08:17.794
208 million euros.

01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:22.831
All Nanite Capital accounts
have been frozen.

01:08:22.967 --> 01:08:26.537
So, how does he plan
to access this money?

01:08:26.672 --> 01:08:29.375
The account's based
in Dubai.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.246
It's outside
your jurisdiction.

01:08:32.381 --> 01:08:34.250
Who knows
about this account?

01:08:35.183 --> 01:08:36.918
Partners in the firm.

01:08:37.054 --> 01:08:38.584
How many are still alive?

01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:44.159
Just me.

01:08:44.295 --> 01:08:46.093
[officer] It's clear
back here. No device.

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:47.897
No pressure plates
in the back.

01:08:48.033 --> 01:08:49.826
He said it was
under our seats.

01:08:52.564 --> 01:08:53.935
What are you waiting for?

01:08:54.071 --> 01:08:56.305
[indistinct conversation]

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:03.371
We're getting your children
out now, but...

01:09:03.507 --> 01:09:04.914
Please, hurry.

01:09:05.049 --> 01:09:06.675
But the bomb under your seat

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:09.581
is hardwired
to the seat sensors.

01:09:09.716 --> 01:09:11.183
Even if we take out
the car battery,

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:12.981
shut down the car's CPI,

01:09:13.117 --> 01:09:16.354
you get up, it will
still trigger the bomb.

01:09:16.489 --> 01:09:17.787
[officer]
Grab my shoulder.

01:09:17.922 --> 01:09:20.758
There you go, Em.
Em, go. It's okay.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.394
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay, baby.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:26.830
It's okay. I love you.

01:09:31.335 --> 01:09:32.774
Dad.

01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:35.212
[sighs deeply]

01:09:36.014 --> 01:09:38.545
Dad, I'm not gonna
leave you.

01:09:40.484 --> 01:09:43.317
- Uh, I'll be fine.
- If you stay, I stay.

01:09:43.452 --> 01:09:45.619
- Go with your sister.
- Dad...

01:09:45.755 --> 01:09:48.718
You just tell that girlfriend
of yours, um, Mila,

01:09:48.854 --> 01:09:51.927
I hope I can still meet her.
Yeah?

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.392
- I hope so too.
- Yeah.

01:09:53.527 --> 01:09:55.859
I made a promise
I'd get you out.

01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:59.262
I love you, Zach.
Go on.

01:09:59.398 --> 01:10:00.902
Love you too.

01:10:01.038 --> 01:10:02.767
I'm gonna fix this.

01:10:05.007 --> 01:10:06.309
Good boy.

01:10:15.713 --> 01:10:17.584
- [gasps]
- Mom.

01:10:19.388 --> 01:10:21.016
- I'm okay.
- Oh, sweetie.

01:10:29.627 --> 01:10:31.494
Can it be deactivated?

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:33.001
We're still working on it.

01:10:33.136 --> 01:10:34.764
Can I talk to my wife?

01:10:34.899 --> 01:10:38.033
You will.
When we get you out.

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:42.141
I need to talk
to her. Please.

01:10:42.277 --> 01:10:44.910
[soft music playing]

01:10:45.046 --> 01:10:46.283
[sighs]

01:10:49.182 --> 01:10:50.485
Okay.

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:59.428
- Ma'am?
- Oh. Oh.

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:02.365
Thank you.

01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.533
Matt?

01:11:06.401 --> 01:11:08.034
- Honey...
- [sighs]

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:09.169
Are you okay?

01:11:09.305 --> 01:11:12.269
Uh, I've had better days.

01:11:12.404 --> 01:11:13.739
[chuckles]

01:11:16.007 --> 01:11:18.974
I didn't do this.
I want you to know that.

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:22.619
Matt, just do whatever
the police say.

01:11:22.754 --> 01:11:25.351
<i>Just listen to them</i>
<i>and they'll get you out,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

01:11:25.486 --> 01:11:27.852
You have to do as they say.

01:11:29.092 --> 01:11:30.426
[Heather sobbing]

01:11:32.094 --> 01:11:33.428
<i>Matt?</i>

01:11:33.564 --> 01:11:35.959
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about everything.

01:11:37.194 --> 01:11:38.995
<i>I-I should've</i>
<i>been there for you.</i>

01:11:39.130 --> 01:11:41.496
- [breathing shakily]
- For all of you.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.168
[Heather crying]

01:11:43.303 --> 01:11:45.001
Don't say that.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.811
I love you, baby.

01:11:48.947 --> 01:11:50.105
I always have.

01:11:52.312 --> 01:11:53.812
Just come home.

01:11:55.781 --> 01:11:58.614
-<i> We'll be okay.</i>
- I will.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.654
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:12:04.558 --> 01:12:06.088
[ambulance engine starts]

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.173
[sniffles]

01:12:17.308 --> 01:12:19.541
You're all here
focused on me.

01:12:20.706 --> 01:12:22.575
And he is still out there.

01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:24.477
He's the one
that did this to me.

01:12:24.612 --> 01:12:26.783
You don't have
to worry about that.

01:12:26.918 --> 01:12:28.143
We'll find him.

01:12:30.748 --> 01:12:32.587
You don't believe me.

01:12:33.556 --> 01:12:36.991
What I believe right now
is irrelevant.

01:12:37.126 --> 01:12:38.561
I can find him.

01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:43.058
Matt, you go into custody.
We'll work through this.

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:46.464
We'll walk through
every possibility.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.097
You have my word on that.

01:12:50.336 --> 01:12:51.699
No.

01:12:51.835 --> 01:12:53.375
[foreboding music plays]

01:12:53.511 --> 01:12:55.742
He set me up
and you all bought it.

01:12:57.474 --> 01:13:00.049
Right now, we're trying
to get you out of this car.

01:13:00.185 --> 01:13:02.184
That is my only objective.

01:13:02.319 --> 01:13:04.617
[foreboding music continues]

01:13:04.753 --> 01:13:07.050
You have your objective,
and I have mine.

01:13:08.018 --> 01:13:11.320
If you can't find him,
I will.

01:13:11.456 --> 01:13:12.390
Matt...

01:13:12.526 --> 01:13:14.629
Tell them to stand down.

[foreboding music continues]

01:13:19.269 --> 01:13:20.668
Tell them to stand down.

01:13:20.803 --> 01:13:23.339
Matt, if you leave,
I cannot protect you.

01:13:23.474 --> 01:13:24.670
I want to be clear
about that.

So, what's it gonna be?

01:14:43.053 --> 01:14:44.048
End it!

01:14:45.617 --> 01:14:47.821
End it! End it!

I told you, Matt.

01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:47.266
You're not as smart
as you think.

[in normal voice] Well,
not quite water into wine,

01:17:55.879 --> 01:17:59.380
but I did just manage
to turn a few bodies

01:17:59.516 --> 01:18:01.511
into 208 million euros.

01:18:01.647 --> 01:18:03.214

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:07.218
I...

01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:12.290
I watched you die
in that explosion.

01:18:12.425 --> 01:18:16.796
Misdirection is at the heart
of all great magic tricks.

01:18:16.932 --> 01:18:19.195
I just needed
a little distraction.

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:22.200
Thankfully,
German trains run on time.

01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:27.440
You know, that last blast
had a little more kick

01:18:27.575 --> 01:18:29.345
than I expected.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.978
But with all that money...

01:18:33.816 --> 01:18:36.115
I'll just get myself
a new face.

01:18:37.687 --> 01:18:40.056
You did this all for money?

01:18:40.191 --> 01:18:41.657
Survival.

01:18:41.793 --> 01:18:44.158

- you son of a bitch!
- [chuckles]

01:18:53.864 --> 01:18:57.371
This was all inevitable, Matt.
Don't take it personally.

01:18:57.506 --> 01:18:58.973
Inevitable?

01:19:00.504 --> 01:19:03.676
If Cinderella's slipper
fit so perfectly,

01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:05.947
then why did it fall off?

01:19:08.616 --> 01:19:09.984
[quietly] Huh?

01:19:11.216 --> 01:19:14.624
Anders, what happened to you?

01:19:14.759 --> 01:19:16.691
You know the business
we're in, Matt.

01:19:16.827 --> 01:19:20.489
It's kill or be killed.
Your words.

01:19:21.492 --> 01:19:24.226
Don't go thinking
you're different than me.

01:19:24.362 --> 01:19:26.869
You're the murderer,
not me.

01:19:30.705 --> 01:19:32.105
You really think so?

01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:36.143
Are you sure about that?

All sounds
pretty convincing to me.

01:20:14.919 --> 01:20:18.980
The bombs, the money.
It all points to you.

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:20.282
[Matt sighs]

01:20:20.418 --> 01:20:22.688
You know what was
the easiest thing?

01:20:22.823 --> 01:20:24.427
Setting up the bombs.

there's a bomb-making service
on the dark web?

01:20:29.094 --> 01:20:30.798
If you pay them a premium,

01:20:30.934 --> 01:20:33.463
they'll even install it
in the car.

01:20:35.972 --> 01:20:38.307
I'm five steps ahead
of everyone, Matt.

01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:39.603
Make no mistake.

01:20:40.573 --> 01:20:46.042
Now, if you'd be so kind
and complete the transaction.

01:20:46.177 --> 01:20:47.884
Transfer the money, Matt.

01:20:49.285 --> 01:20:54.457
The minute you try to withdraw
one cent of that money,

01:20:54.592 --> 01:20:56.090
they'll know you're alive.

01:20:56.924 --> 01:20:58.659
It's in a crypto account.

01:20:58.794 --> 01:21:00.663
Untraceable. Impregnable.

01:21:00.798 --> 01:21:02.028
You really think
I haven't thought

01:21:02.163 --> 01:21:04.626
of every single
possible permutation?

01:21:06.531 --> 01:21:09.537
When your kids
got in the car this morning,

01:21:09.673 --> 01:21:10.965
do you think I panicked?

01:21:11.735 --> 01:21:14.402
The one day that you decide
to be a good daddy

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:17.678
and drive your kids
to school? No.

01:21:17.813 --> 01:21:21.013
I adapted. I overcame.

01:21:21.148 --> 01:21:22.578
Just like I did
when Pils Kroger

01:21:22.714 --> 01:21:25.114
was going to pull the rug
out from under us.

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:28.085
He was going to destroy us.

01:21:28.221 --> 01:21:30.118
I wasn't gonna
let that happen.

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:34.424
He found out
you were siphoning money
from the offshore account.

01:21:34.559 --> 01:21:37.530
The FCA doesn't look kindly
on embezzlement.

01:21:37.665 --> 01:21:39.601
He...

01:21:39.736 --> 01:21:42.037
he did nothing to you.

01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:47.141
And what did you do
when you found out? Hmm?

01:21:48.479 --> 01:21:50.545
You did nothing.

01:21:50.681 --> 01:21:54.075
- You looked the other way.
- I didn't know
what you were doing.

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.952
Don't be naive!

01:21:57.253 --> 01:21:59.021
It's always been about
the bottom line for us.

01:21:59.156 --> 01:22:02.288
Bullshit! Everything I did
was above board.

01:22:02.423 --> 01:22:04.758
You really do think
you're different, don't you?

01:22:04.894 --> 01:22:07.796
At least I accept who I am.

01:22:07.931 --> 01:22:10.260
You just lie to yourself
every day.

01:22:10.395 --> 01:22:12.495
You just let it
eat away at you

01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:15.334
until your own family
doesn't recognize you.

01:22:16.437 --> 01:22:18.941
I'm not surprised
Heather wants to leave you.

01:22:19.077 --> 01:22:22.272
I'm just surprised
it took this long to do it.

01:22:22.408 --> 01:22:26.180
Now stop wasting time.
Call the bank!

01:22:28.185 --> 01:22:31.785
I said call the bank.
This is your last chance.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.983
[tense music playing]

01:22:34.119 --> 01:22:36.157
I said call them.

01:22:41.192 --> 01:22:42.427
[loudly] Call them!

01:22:45.797 --> 01:22:48.235
There's one thing
you didn't think of, Anders.

01:22:50.406 --> 01:22:55.807
What a man will do
when he's got nothing to lose.

01:22:55.942 --> 01:22:56.908

[grunting]

01:23:12.255 --> 01:23:13.361
Pull over, Matt.

01:23:13.497 --> 01:23:15.163
Stop!

01:23:15.998 --> 01:23:17.766
- Stop!
- No, no.

01:23:17.901 --> 01:23:19.197
- I said stop!
- No.

01:23:19.332 --> 01:23:21.068
Pull over
or I'll kill us both!

01:23:21.203 --> 01:23:23.805
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Heather.

01:23:23.941 --> 01:23:25.167
- Pull over!
- [grunts]

01:23:25.302 --> 01:23:26.702
