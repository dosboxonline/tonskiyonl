00:37.269 --> 00:41.432
-Whoa, Tappy!
-(Cheering)

00:41.481 --> 00:44.766

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:52.033 --> 00:54.950
-We got a winner.
-(Audience) We got a winner.

00:54.994 --> 00:57.567
-I said, we got a winner.
-We got a winner!

00:57.621 --> 00:59.661
We got a winner!

00:59.706 --> 01:02.743
She's a flight attendant
from Washington, DC.

01:02.793 --> 01:05.248
Please welcome Mary Kellington.

01:05.295 --> 01:09.245
(Audience) Juice by Mary!
Juice by Mary! Whoa...

01:09.716 --> 01:12.633
Harold, please, not again the TV.

01:12.677 --> 01:16.757
Ma! Come on, Ma! Why do you have
to make a big deal outta this?

01:16.806 --> 01:20.389
You know you'll get the set back
in a couple of hours.

01:22.270 --> 01:24.974
Why you gotta make me
feel so guilty, Ma?!

01:32.237 --> 01:34.313
Jesus! What are you doing?

01:34.364 --> 01:38.314
Trying to get me to break
my own mother's set? Or radiator?

01:38.368 --> 01:40.657
And maybe blow up the house?

01:40.704 --> 01:45.365
Your own flesh and blood! Is that
what you're trying to do? Your son?

01:47.877 --> 01:51.163
Why you play games with my head,
for Christ's sake?

01:51.214 --> 01:53.502
Harold, I wouldn't do that.

01:54.508 --> 01:58.376
The chain isn't for you.
It's for the robbers.

01:58.429 --> 02:00.468
Then why won't you come out?

02:00.514 --> 02:03.266
(Rattles door)

02:05.477 --> 02:08.727
See what I mean?
See how you always upset me, Ma?

02:08.772 --> 02:10.480
Christ's sake.

02:20.825 --> 02:22.284
(Sighs)

02:23.494 --> 02:24.953
Ma?

02:26.831 --> 02:28.289
Ma!

02:30.835 --> 02:33.622
Come on out. Please, Ma?

02:37.090 --> 02:39.379
Ah, screw it!

02:40.469 --> 02:42.129
This isn't happening.

02:42.179 --> 02:46.093
And if it should be happening,
it would be all right.

02:46.141 --> 02:50.637
So don't worry, Seymour.
It'll all work out.

02:50.687 --> 02:54.554
You'll see already.
In the end, it's all nice.

03:00.154 --> 03:04.650
Shit, man. That motherfucker's
starting to look a little seedy.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.739
You particular all of a sudden?

03:07.828 --> 03:11.244
I don't care,
just as long as we get our bread.

03:11.290 --> 03:14.125
Just give me a hand, Tyrone.

03:16.628 --> 03:18.371
(Woman) look at that.

03:21.966 --> 03:24.291
-Hello.
-(All) Hi.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.003
Fuck, the table too!

05:31.047 --> 05:34.665
What do you want?
You want me to schlep it on my back?

05:34.717 --> 05:38.667
-You got a friend.
-I ain't my leper's schlepper.

05:38.721 --> 05:42.968
Such a son. Your mother needs you
like a moose needs a hat rack.

05:50.023 --> 05:52.099
( # Dance music)

05:55.862 --> 05:58.400
(laughing)

06:01.034 --> 06:02.861
(Music pauses)

06:09.959 --> 06:12.035
Shit, man.

06:12.086 --> 06:14.873
This is some boss scag, baby.

06:14.922 --> 06:19.169
-I mean, dynamite.
-Oh, man, it's something else.

06:24.931 --> 06:26.805
You know what we need to do?

06:28.560 --> 06:33.222
We need to get us a piece of this
Brody shit, cut it up and off it!

06:33.273 --> 06:35.811
We could double our money... easy.

06:35.858 --> 06:39.274
Buy some pieces
and we got some whole other shit.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.194
That'd be righteous.

06:41.239 --> 06:46.944
I'll bet in no time we'd get a pound
of pure straight from Sal the Geep.

06:46.994 --> 06:48.274
oooh!

06:48.329 --> 06:51.744
That's what I'm talking about,
baby -no hassles.

06:53.959 --> 06:56.414
-How's it goin'?
-What's up, buddy?

06:56.461 --> 06:58.703
-The usual?.
-Yeah, sounds good.

07:34.414 --> 07:37.201
Anything else? Huh?

07:39.335 --> 07:42.834
-(Waiter) Anything else?
-Ah, no.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.087
Nothing. I'm all right.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.052
-Good afternoon, Mrs Goldfarb.
-Good afternoon, Mr Rabinowitz.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.222
Although I'm not so sure
how good it is. And you?

08:00.272 --> 08:04.139
-What can I say? You want your TV?
-Yes, if you don't mind.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.238
Mrs Goldfarb,
can I ask you a question?

08:08.279 --> 08:10.153
You won't take it personal?.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.697
How many years we know each other?
Who's to count?

08:14.744 --> 08:18.492
Why not tell the police?
Maybe they could talk to Harry.

08:18.539 --> 08:23.117
-He wouldn't be stealing the TV.
-I couldn't do that.

08:23.169 --> 08:27.296
Harry's my only child.
He's all I have.

08:27.339 --> 08:30.091
Thank you, Mr Rabinowitz.

10:12.105 --> 10:15.225
-(Man) 'Mrs Sara Goldfarb?'
-Me. Speaking.

10:15.275 --> 10:18.062
This is lyle Russell
from Maylin and Block.

10:18.111 --> 10:21.859
-I'm not interested.
-'Wait. I'm not selling anything.

10:21.906 --> 10:26.402
'I just want to offer you
a chance to be on television.'

10:26.452 --> 10:27.911

Mrs Goldfarb. Congratulations!'

10:31.498 --> 10:34.832

-'I don't want money.

-'Yes, Mrs Goldfarb.'

10:49.724 --> 10:53.140

on television. I'm just...

(Sighs)

12:07.673 --> 12:12.548
(Harry) But I don't get it.
Why are you so hard on your folks?

12:12.594 --> 12:14.919
I mean, they give you everything.

12:14.972 --> 12:18.839
They hook you up with an apartment,
a croaker shrink.

12:18.892 --> 12:22.724
(Woman) Which is fine, you know.
It's great. It's just...

12:22.771 --> 12:26.554
money is never what I really
wanted from them, you know?

12:26.608 --> 12:29.811
That's pretty much
all they have to give.

12:30.903 --> 12:33.608
(Harry) Why don't you
get away from 'em?

12:33.656 --> 12:37.570
-How am I gonna do that?
-I don't know.

12:37.618 --> 12:39.694
What about your clothes?

12:39.745 --> 12:43.410
Your sketches are great.
Open up a store.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.917
-I can't.
-Why not?

12:46.960 --> 12:49.534
When will I have time
to hang with you?

13:02.558 --> 13:07.434
-Well! So where's the party?
-When I tell you, you're gonna die.

13:12.484 --> 13:14.477
This is a tough one.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.904
I got a great diet book.

13:23.495 --> 13:25.487
Hey.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.996
(Alarm blaring)

13:35.548 --> 13:37.208

15:12.557 --> 15:15.226
I thought I'd catch
a little sun today.

15:15.267 --> 15:18.102
Really?
Well, in a box you'll catch it.

15:18.145 --> 15:23.436
Just relax and think how gorgeous
you'll look with your new red hair.

15:23.484 --> 15:26.603
Today the hair, tomorrow the sun.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.730
Anybody wanna waste some time?

15:34.869 --> 15:37.028
(Harry) 'Angel says do it now.'

15:37.080 --> 15:40.413
(Tyrone) 'I'll call Brody.'
(Marion) 'Brody?'

15:40.458 --> 15:44.787
(Harry) 'He gets unbelievable shit.'
(Tyrone) 'Righteous.'

15:44.837 --> 15:48.704
(Harry) 'look, we got this idea.'
(Marion) 'What is it?'

15:48.758 --> 15:52.802
(Harry) 'Get a piece of stuff,
cut it up and double our money.'

15:52.845 --> 15:56.011
(Tyrone) 'Then get a pound
of pure and retire.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.132
'You know what that means.'

15:58.183 --> 16:01.766
(Harry) 'We get off hard knocks
and on easy street.'

16:02.854 --> 16:04.728
What's the catch?

16:05.273 --> 16:07.978
That's a red. I mean, that's a red.

16:08.026 --> 16:12.070
It's not a red red,
but that's a red. It's a red.

16:12.113 --> 16:14.236
-Red?
-Yeah. It's a red.

16:14.282 --> 16:17.401
-You're telling me that's red?
-Yeah.

16:17.451 --> 16:19.325
Then what's orange?

16:19.370 --> 16:22.573
If this is a red,
I want to know -what's orange?

16:25.834 --> 16:29.037
Well, it could be...

16:30.839 --> 16:33.840
that it's a little orange too.

16:35.802 --> 16:38.210
You know something?

16:45.061 --> 16:49.308
I always thought you were the most
beautiful girl I ever seen.

16:50.024 --> 16:51.483
Really?

16:56.196 --> 16:58.569
Ever since I first saw you.

16:59.658 --> 17:01.816
That's nice, Harry.

17:07.541 --> 17:11.040
That makes me feel really good.

17:13.421 --> 17:16.090
Other people
have told me that before,

17:16.132 --> 17:18.670
and it was meaningless.

17:26.142 --> 17:31.432
Why? Because you thought
they were pulling your leg?

17:31.480 --> 17:34.931
No, no, not like that. I mean...

17:34.983 --> 17:38.601
I don't know. I don't know
or even care if they were.

17:38.653 --> 17:40.860
Just from them it was...

17:43.033 --> 17:46.567
just meaningless, you know?

17:47.662 --> 17:51.197
When you say it, I hear it.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.249
I really hear it.

18:01.175 --> 18:06.002
Somebody like you could really
make things all right for me.

18:06.054 --> 18:07.928
You think?

18:10.767 --> 18:12.641
(Marion) What is it?

18:12.686 --> 18:15.852
(Harry) Remember when I told you
about the store?

18:15.897 --> 18:17.356
Yeah.

18:17.398 --> 18:19.889
I've been thinking about it and...

18:19.943 --> 18:23.311
I put together some numbers and...

18:23.362 --> 18:25.438
and it's not impossible!

18:26.532 --> 18:29.153
I mean, you know, you could do it.

18:29.201 --> 18:31.110
You should do it!

18:31.162 --> 18:34.115
I mean, we could do it together.

18:41.088 --> 18:42.914
What do you think?

19:46.400 --> 19:48.973
-(Stomach rumbling)
-Stop already.

19:49.027 --> 19:53.772
You'll feel better in the red dress
than in the cheese Danish.

20:30.441 --> 20:33.062
'Three things changed my life.
Three.'

20:33.110 --> 20:35.815
(Audience) 'Number one!
No red meat!'

20:35.863 --> 20:38.983
'Think about it.
What do they stick in red meat?

20:39.033 --> 20:43.529
'I ate red meat to the point where
I would eat it...right off, raw.

20:43.579 --> 20:45.951
'I loved my meat!
I turned it around.

20:45.998 --> 20:49.663
'You need to be committed.
You need to be passionate.

20:49.710 --> 20:53.209
'No red meat for 30 days.
No red meat!

20:53.255 --> 20:57.334
'Three things is all I did
to change my life. Three things.'

21:06.559 --> 21:07.590
(Sizzling)

21:07.643 --> 21:10.893
Ada told us. It's gorgeous.

21:10.938 --> 21:13.096
We're gonna make it darker.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.390
-Why?
-To go with my red dress.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.443
-But it's looking like Madonna.
-It's not.

21:18.487 --> 21:21.772
And neither is this.
But soon -I'm going on a diet.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.492
-What diet?
-Eggs and grapefruit.

21:24.534 --> 21:27.488
-I was on that. lots of luck.
-It's not so bad.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.945
-How long you been on it?
-All day.

21:29.998 --> 21:34.209
-All day! It's one o'clock!
-(All laugh)

21:34.252 --> 21:36.790
-Thinking thin.
-She's thinking thin.

21:36.838 --> 21:40.206
My louise, she lost 50lbs
just like that.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.131
-like what?
-Poof!

21:42.176 --> 21:45.426
-Did you put her in a sweatbox?
-(All laugh)

21:45.471 --> 21:49.634
She went to a doctor. He gave
her pills. You don't want to eat.

21:49.683 --> 21:55.388
So? You mean, I'm sitting here
not thinking about pastrami on rye?

21:55.438 --> 21:58.642
Don't talk like that
when someone's on a diet.

21:58.692 --> 22:02.107
Big deal. I'll sneak
another wedge of grapefruit.

22:04.155 --> 22:07.738
-I'm thinking thin!
-Ooh, Sara, the mailman.

22:07.784 --> 22:13.026
Sara Goldfarb? You have something
for me? I'm expecting something.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.449
Goldfarb, Goldfarb. Sara Goldfarb.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.908
-Is that it?
-That's it!

22:18.961 --> 22:21.368
-Come on.
-I gotta get my stuff.

22:21.421 --> 22:23.331
-All right.
-I can tell you.

22:23.382 --> 22:26.585
Your name. Put your name.

22:26.635 --> 22:29.885
S-A-R-A G-O-l-D...

22:29.930 --> 22:32.171
(All) F-A-R-B!

22:32.223 --> 22:33.717
Dynamite?

22:34.601 --> 22:36.095
It's dynamite.

22:37.395 --> 22:40.100
A-ha! Dynamite!

22:40.148 --> 22:42.603
All right, we on our way.

22:42.650 --> 22:46.149
-Brody's man says it's fine shit.
-All right, man.

22:47.154 --> 22:49.906
-Here we go.
-Hey, Ty?

22:51.450 --> 22:55.198
-let's do this right, man.
-Come on, baby. Naturally.

22:58.582 --> 23:03.789
-Hurry, hurry. let's hurry.
-I wonder when you'll hear.

23:03.837 --> 23:06.921
-Hi!
-I wanna come with you!

23:06.965 --> 23:11.757
Maybe they'll send you to the
Tavern On The Green with the stars.

23:11.803 --> 23:15.171
Yeah, eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern On The Green.

23:15.222 --> 23:19.302
-I hope they have that.
-Hurry before the mailman comes.

23:19.351 --> 23:21.225
-Here we are.
-Mail it!

23:21.270 --> 23:23.677
(Woman) Oh, Sara!

24:10.483 --> 24:12.808
(Silence)

24:30.335 --> 24:32.079
(lock turning)

24:35.757 --> 24:38.841
-There it is, Jim.
-Huh?

24:40.095 --> 24:44.092
-There it is, baby.
-Oh, shit!

24:44.140 --> 24:48.434
-Shall we try it?
-Wait, Ty.

24:48.478 --> 24:53.435
look, this is our chance
to make it big.

24:53.482 --> 24:58.523
We play it right,
we can get a pound of pure.

24:58.570 --> 25:01.357
But if we get wasted...

25:01.406 --> 25:04.941
-we'll fuck it up.
-Right on.

25:04.993 --> 25:08.611
Hey, look, I ain't trying
to jive you, Jim.

25:08.663 --> 25:12.079
I don't wanna be runnin'
the streets my whole life,

25:12.125 --> 25:14.248
my nose runnin' down to my chin.

25:14.294 --> 25:18.540
All I'm sayin' is take a little
taste so we know how much to cut.

25:18.589 --> 25:20.048
It's business.

25:22.551 --> 25:24.211
Yeah, fair enough.

25:30.517 --> 25:34.017
-Shit...
-(Both laughing)

25:50.036 --> 25:52.609
'Thank you!
Three things is all I did.

25:52.663 --> 25:54.620
'30 days is all it takes.

25:54.665 --> 25:57.785
'Number two! No refined sugar!

25:57.835 --> 26:00.242
'Now, sugar's everywhere.

26:00.296 --> 26:03.499
'You know they even put sugar
in bottled water?

26:03.549 --> 26:06.585
'I was sick with sugar!
That was my medicine.

26:06.635 --> 26:10.549
'It nurtured my spiralling brain
that felt I was a loser.'

26:10.597 --> 26:12.257
'Juice by you!'

26:12.307 --> 26:16.933
-'Rule two is no refined sugar.
-(Sizzling)

26:16.978 --> 26:20.347
'Sodas? Don't even
think about sodas any more.

26:20.398 --> 26:24.312
'No sucking candies. None of that.
Just stay away from it.

26:24.360 --> 26:28.654
-'No refined sugar. For 30 days.'
-(Sizzling)

26:28.698 --> 26:30.524
'I'm gonna eat right.

26:30.574 --> 26:34.323
'I am gonna pick up my spirits
and I am gonna try!

26:34.370 --> 26:39.197
'I found hope.
And in that hope, I found a way...'

26:39.249 --> 26:41.325
(Cheering on TV)

26:47.924 --> 26:49.584
Shut up!

27:11.697 --> 27:12.728
(Splat)

27:23.291 --> 27:24.951
(Woman) 'Hello?'

27:25.001 --> 27:26.578
-Rosie?
-'Yeah.'

27:26.627 --> 27:28.205
-Sara.
-'Yeah?'

27:28.254 --> 27:30.496
I need the number
of that doctor.

27:32.299 --> 27:35.715
(Harry) I don't understand
why you gotta see him.

27:35.761 --> 27:38.881
Cut the son of a bitch loose,
for Christ's sake.

27:38.931 --> 27:43.308
Because he'll tell my parents
that I've stopped therapy.

27:43.352 --> 27:46.471
They're already thinking
of cutting me off.

27:47.606 --> 27:49.931
Harry, I'm not gonna sleep with him.

27:49.983 --> 27:53.149
I'm gonna come home
after the concert.

27:53.194 --> 27:55.483
You're jealous!

27:56.531 --> 27:58.938
Harry -jealous?

28:00.409 --> 28:03.659
-Put your arms around me.
-No.

28:03.704 --> 28:06.871
You are so stubborn!
Put your arms around me.

28:09.251 --> 28:10.959
Stop that!

28:12.004 --> 28:14.755
-I'll suck your eyeballs out.
-Mm-hm.

28:15.841 --> 28:17.251
Well...

28:17.300 --> 28:20.669
I'm disappointed
that you're indisposed.

28:22.973 --> 28:25.298
Is Anita out of town or something?

28:26.518 --> 28:28.261
Why do you ask?

28:28.311 --> 28:31.762
I was just wondering
if she was "indisposed".

28:36.485 --> 28:37.944
No.

28:37.987 --> 28:42.280
She's fine, thank you.
Actually, she's in Florida.

28:42.324 --> 28:46.369
-Can I ask you something, Arnold?
-Of course.

28:50.082 --> 28:51.908
Anything. What?

28:51.958 --> 28:54.663
-You just have something here.
-Gone?

28:54.711 --> 28:57.546
A little bit, a little bit lower.

28:57.589 --> 29:00.210
It's OK. Don't worry.
It's much better.

29:00.258 --> 29:01.717
Arnold!

29:04.470 --> 29:06.712
How are you, Mrs Goldfarb?

29:06.764 --> 29:10.631
How am I? Enormous.
That's why I'm here.

29:10.684 --> 29:13.602
-I've seen much worse.
-Oh...thank you.

29:14.688 --> 29:18.187
-How's your hearing and vision?
-I have both.

29:19.276 --> 29:21.814
The doctor will be with you shortly.

29:29.661 --> 29:32.496
-You're a little overweight.
-A little?

29:32.538 --> 29:35.208
I have 50lbs
I'm willing to donate.

29:35.249 --> 29:38.120
We can take care of that.
No problem.

30:28.717 --> 30:30.590
We're on our way, baby.

30:30.635 --> 30:33.043
We are on our way!

30:33.096 --> 30:37.093
God, It was great out there.
I mean, everybody is thirsty.

30:37.141 --> 30:40.059
Come to me. (laughing)

30:40.102 --> 30:43.637
Harry! I am so glad.

30:49.278 --> 30:51.235
(Man) Naturally.

30:54.783 --> 30:56.740
(Man) Naturally.

31:01.957 --> 31:03.914
(Man) Naturally.

31:27.689 --> 31:29.812
Purple in the morning.

31:29.858 --> 31:31.767
Blue in the afternoon.

31:31.818 --> 31:33.692
orange in the evening.

31:35.155 --> 31:38.191
There's my three meals,
Mr Smarty-pants.

31:39.993 --> 31:42.910
And green at night. Just like that.

31:42.954 --> 31:44.697
one, two, three, four.

32:05.016 --> 32:07.305
( # latin American music)

32:22.324 --> 32:25.491
( # Music speeds up)

32:55.064 --> 32:57.222
Come back to bed, baby.

32:57.274 --> 33:00.524
Come on now, Alice.
Got plenty of time for that.

33:00.569 --> 33:04.068
Right now I'm grooving
with these new mirrors I got.

33:04.114 --> 33:06.190
oooh!

33:24.884 --> 33:28.217
(Whispers) I told ya, Mom,
one day I'd make it.

33:28.262 --> 33:31.132
You don't have to make anything,
my sweet.

33:31.181 --> 33:33.719
You just have
to love your mama, huh?

33:33.767 --> 33:35.973
(Alice) What ya doin', baby?

33:36.019 --> 33:37.478
Huh?

33:37.521 --> 33:40.557
-What ya doin', baby?
-Nothin'.

33:44.444 --> 33:46.353
Just thinkin' about you.

33:47.989 --> 33:50.990
About the nasty things
I'm about to do to ya.

33:51.033 --> 33:53.524
(laughs) Bitch, get over here!

33:53.578 --> 33:55.451
(laughing)

33:55.496 --> 33:58.248
Ty, you scare me to death.

33:58.290 --> 34:03.082
No, I wouldn't scare you.
I don't wanna scare nobody.

34:05.130 --> 34:09.875
All I want out of life is a bit
of peace and happiness. That's all.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.635
Right now...

34:13.930 --> 34:18.010
you're the finest fox
I ever laid my eyes on.

34:19.936 --> 34:22.937
(Harry) That's what I'll do.
(Marion) Hmm?

34:22.980 --> 34:27.607
For my mother. I've been thinking
about getting something for her.

34:27.652 --> 34:29.893
like...a present or something.

34:29.945 --> 34:33.231
But I didn't know
what I was gonna get, until now.

34:33.282 --> 34:36.033
-And?
-I finally asked myself, right,

34:36.076 --> 34:38.567
what's her fix?

34:38.620 --> 34:40.577
Television, right?

34:40.622 --> 34:43.706
If ever there's a TV junkie,
it's the old lady.

34:43.750 --> 34:47.166
I owe her a new set,
with all the wear and tear it got

34:47.212 --> 34:50.415
being schlepped
back and forth to old Abe's.

34:50.465 --> 34:52.671
You really love her, don't you?

34:55.094 --> 34:57.585
I-I guess so. You know?

35:00.433 --> 35:03.932
Most of the time
I just want her to be happy.

35:03.978 --> 35:07.263
-let's go get it now.
-(Sighs)

35:07.314 --> 35:09.686
let's push off first.

35:11.068 --> 35:12.728
(Marion laughs)

35:12.778 --> 35:16.561
It's early, Harry. We shouldn't
get going till tonight.

36:03.909 --> 36:06.447
'Be excited. Be, be excited.

36:06.745 --> 36:09.616
'Be excited. Be, be excited.

36:09.665 --> 36:11.242
'Be excited.

36:11.291 --> 36:13.782
'Be committed and be passionate.'

36:13.836 --> 36:19.459
(Man) 'I am a living testament.
65lbs thinner. I feel great!

36:27.640 --> 36:31.341
'Number three. Ohhh, number three!

36:31.394 --> 36:35.972
(Speaking very slowly)
'This drives most people crazy.

36:36.023 --> 36:40.899
'This is easy so far.'

36:40.945 --> 36:44.479
(Voice continues, slowing down)

36:51.455 --> 36:53.827
(Children playing outside)

37:35.830 --> 37:39.697
-That is thin!
-She's not the same person.

37:39.750 --> 37:44.329
I can almost zip the red dress.
I've almost got the zipper up.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.253
-The mailman!
-Oh!

37:46.298 --> 37:48.670
When I see it
I'll wave it all over.

37:48.717 --> 37:51.386
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

37:51.428 --> 37:55.128
-What did he say?
-Don't worry, Sara, it'll come.

37:56.224 --> 37:58.715
Yeah, don't worry. It'll come.

38:00.603 --> 38:02.014
It's Harry!

38:02.063 --> 38:03.522
Harry, oh!

38:03.565 --> 38:08.226
Hey, Ma, easy.
You'll crush me, for Christ sakes.

38:08.277 --> 38:10.400
-Come inside.
-Hello.

38:10.446 --> 38:14.491
(All) Hi, Harry! Hello!
(Sara) We'll have a little visit.

38:14.533 --> 38:17.404
So, how are you, Harry?
You look so good.

38:17.453 --> 38:20.122
-You want something to eat?
-No, Ma.

38:20.164 --> 38:24.457
A little nosh, a piece of cake?
I could go and get something.

38:24.501 --> 38:27.917
I don't have anything in the house,
but Ada would.

38:27.963 --> 38:30.454
A cupcake?
You want something to eat?

38:30.507 --> 38:33.507
No, no, Ma, nothing. Please, sit.

38:33.551 --> 38:36.505
You're making me dizzy,
for Christ's sake.

38:36.554 --> 38:40.137
You notice anything, huh?
You notice I'm slimmer?

38:40.183 --> 38:42.175
Yeah, I guess you are.

38:42.226 --> 38:45.761
25lbs, I lost. 25lbs!
Can you believe it?

38:45.813 --> 38:49.431
-And that's only the beginning.
-That's great, Ma.

38:49.483 --> 38:53.018
I'm really happy for you.
But will you sit? Please.

38:55.822 --> 39:01.362
I'm sorry I haven't been around
in a while, Ma, but I've been busy.

39:01.411 --> 39:04.365
Yeah? You got a good job?
You're doing well?.

39:04.414 --> 39:07.664
-Yeah, good, real good.
-What kind of business?

39:07.709 --> 39:12.335
Well, I'm sort of a distributor
like, for a big importer.

39:12.380 --> 39:17.207
-Ohh! I'm so happy for you!
-Ma... Easy. You're killin' me.

39:17.259 --> 39:20.046
Jesus, what,
you been lifting weights?

39:20.095 --> 39:22.882
-I knew you could do that.
-You were right.

39:22.931 --> 39:26.217
Now maybe you'll meet
a nice girl and have a baby?

39:27.769 --> 39:30.058
Well, I already met one.

39:30.105 --> 39:32.678
-(Squealing)
-Ma, don't go ape shit.

39:32.732 --> 39:35.899
-Who is she? Who's her parents?
-You know her.

39:35.944 --> 39:40.107
-Marion? Marion Silver. Remember?
-Oh, Silver!

39:40.156 --> 39:43.192
of course. Manhattan Beach.

39:43.242 --> 39:46.445
House on the esplanade.
Garment business.

39:46.495 --> 39:48.654
He's big in women's undies.

39:48.706 --> 39:53.581
Before you go bouncing all over
again and make me forget, just...

39:54.712 --> 39:58.376
What I wanna tell you
is that I got you a present.

39:58.423 --> 40:01.626
I don't need a present.
Just have a baby.

40:01.676 --> 40:05.341
Will you let me tell you
what I got ya? Will ya, Ma?

40:06.431 --> 40:10.808
Christ, you are really something
else today, you know that?

40:10.852 --> 40:13.425
look, I know...

40:14.897 --> 40:16.356
Well...

40:17.942 --> 40:22.734
I'm sorry for being such a bastard.
I wanna make it up.

40:22.780 --> 40:26.612
I mean, I know I can't change
anything that's happened,

40:26.659 --> 40:29.066
but I want you to know that...

40:29.119 --> 40:33.033
That I love ya, and that I'm sorry.

40:33.081 --> 40:38.241
And I want you to be happy.
So I got you a brand-new TV set.

40:38.295 --> 40:42.541
It's gonna be delivered in a
couple of days. It's from Macy's!

40:42.590 --> 40:44.334
oh, Harry!

40:47.136 --> 40:49.010
Your father'd be so happy

40:49.055 --> 40:52.506
if he could see
what you're doing for your mother.

40:56.061 --> 40:57.970
See that, Seymour?

40:58.022 --> 41:01.188
(Grinding teeth)
You see how good your son is?

41:01.233 --> 41:05.396
He knows what it's like
for his mother living all alone.

41:05.445 --> 41:07.604
No one to visit her.

41:07.656 --> 41:09.732
(Grinding teeth)

41:18.958 --> 41:20.832
Hey, Ma.

41:20.877 --> 41:23.498
-You on uppers?
-What?

41:23.546 --> 41:27.460
You're on uppers.
You're on diet pills, ain't you?

41:27.508 --> 41:30.046
I told you.
I'm going to a specialist.

41:30.094 --> 41:33.509
That's what I thought!
You're on speed, ain't ya?

41:33.555 --> 41:35.880
Harry, I'm goin' to a doctor.

41:35.933 --> 41:39.384
-Does he give you pills?
-Of course. He's a doctor.

41:39.436 --> 41:42.805
-What kind of pills?
-A purple, a blue, an orange...

41:42.856 --> 41:44.813
I mean, like what's in 'em?

41:44.858 --> 41:49.769
Oh, Harry, I'm Sara Goldfarb, not
Albert Einstein. How should I know?

41:49.821 --> 41:52.775
Does it make you feel good
and give you pep?

41:52.824 --> 41:55.528
Well... yeah, a little.

41:55.576 --> 41:58.245
Ma, I can hear ya
grinding your teeth.

41:58.287 --> 42:00.742
-That goes away at night.
-At night?

42:00.789 --> 42:05.083
Yeah, when I take the green one.
30 minutes I'm asleep. Poof.

42:05.127 --> 42:08.246
Ma, Ma, ya gotta
cut that stuff loose.

42:08.297 --> 42:10.372
I'm tellin' ya, it's no good.

42:10.424 --> 42:13.424
What do you mean it's no good?
25lbs I've lost.

42:13.468 --> 42:16.089
So what? You wanna be a dope fiend?

42:16.137 --> 42:20.716
Dope fiend? Am I foaming
at the mouth? He's a nice doctor.

42:20.767 --> 42:23.055
I am telling you, he's no good.

42:23.102 --> 42:27.266
How come you know so much? How
come you know more than a doctor?

42:28.983 --> 42:32.980
Believe me, Ma, I know. All right?

42:34.029 --> 42:36.188
You'll get strung out.

42:36.240 --> 42:39.276
Ah, come on!
I almost fit in my red dress.

42:39.326 --> 42:42.410
The one I wore
to your high school graduation.

42:42.454 --> 42:44.743
The one your father liked so much.

42:44.789 --> 42:49.001
oh, I remember how he looked at me
in that red dress.

42:50.461 --> 42:53.913
Ma, what's the big deal
about the red dress?

42:55.925 --> 42:58.332
I'm going to wear it at...

42:59.428 --> 43:01.504
You don't know!

43:01.555 --> 43:06.383
I'm gonna be on television.
I got a call and an application...

43:06.435 --> 43:09.352
Come on, Ma, who's pulling your leg?

43:09.396 --> 43:11.305
No, no, no. I'm tellin' ya.

43:11.356 --> 43:14.559
I'm gonna be a contestant
on television.

43:14.609 --> 43:17.231
They haven't told me when yet,

43:17.279 --> 43:22.439
but you'll be proud when you see
your mother in her red dress on TV.

43:22.492 --> 43:27.734
What is the big deal?. Those pills
will kill you before you get on.

43:27.789 --> 43:29.781
"Big deal?. "

43:29.832 --> 43:31.706
You drove up in a cab.

43:31.751 --> 43:34.704
Did you see who had the best seat?

43:34.753 --> 43:37.423
I'm somebody now, Harry.

43:37.464 --> 43:40.038
Everybody likes me.

43:40.092 --> 43:41.800
Soon...

43:41.844 --> 43:45.888
millions of people will see me
and they'll all like me.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.763
I'll tell them about you...

43:48.808 --> 43:50.468
and your father.

43:51.144 --> 43:53.053
How good he was to us.

43:53.104 --> 43:54.764
Remember?

43:58.026 --> 44:00.647
It's a reason
to get up in the morning.

44:01.696 --> 44:06.523
It's a reason to lose weight,
to fit in the red dress.

44:08.118 --> 44:10.277
It's a reason to smile.

44:12.122 --> 44:15.289
It makes tomorrow all right.

44:17.461 --> 44:20.082
(Sighs) What have I got, Harry?

44:20.839 --> 44:22.297
Hmm?

44:22.340 --> 44:26.801
Why should I even make the bed
or wash the dishes?

44:26.845 --> 44:30.296
I do them, but why should I?

44:31.557 --> 44:33.217
I'm alone.

44:34.310 --> 44:37.726
Your father's gone, you're gone.

44:40.107 --> 44:42.680
I got no one to...

44:42.735 --> 44:44.608
care for.

44:45.445 --> 44:47.604
What have I got, Harry?

44:52.661 --> 44:54.369
I'm lonely.

44:56.623 --> 44:58.414
I'm old.

44:58.458 --> 45:00.830
You got friends, Ma.

45:00.877 --> 45:03.165
It's not the same.

45:04.714 --> 45:06.587
They don't need me.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.843
I like the way I feel.

45:15.849 --> 45:18.601
I like thinking
about the red dress...

45:18.644 --> 45:22.688
and the television
and you and your father.

45:24.357 --> 45:27.940
Now when I get the sun, I smile.

45:34.117 --> 45:35.943
I'll come and visit, Ma.

45:37.078 --> 45:41.704
Now that I'm straight, m-my business
is going good, I'll come.

45:41.749 --> 45:44.322
Me and Marion,
we'll come for dinner.

45:44.376 --> 45:46.250
Good. You bring her.

45:46.295 --> 45:49.046
I'll make you
mushroom soup and a roast.

45:50.007 --> 45:53.292
That sounds great, Ma.
That sounds great.

45:53.343 --> 45:57.175
-I'll call ahead, all right?
-OK.

45:58.974 --> 46:00.633
I'm glad.

46:00.683 --> 46:05.678
I'm glad you have a nice girl
and your own business. I'm glad.

46:12.153 --> 46:13.730
I gotta go, Ma.

46:13.779 --> 46:17.113
I got an appointment in Manhattan
in a little bit,

46:17.157 --> 46:19.067
but I'll be back.

46:19.118 --> 46:22.783
-OK, y-you still got your key?
-Yeah, I got it, Ma.

46:25.248 --> 46:26.908
Bye, Son.

46:26.958 --> 46:28.832
(Door closes)

46:34.632 --> 46:36.459
(Sighs)

47:04.869 --> 47:07.194
Brody says you comin' up quick.

47:07.247 --> 47:10.497
oh. Thanks, man.

47:13.252 --> 47:17.332
He says you're smart, you're loyal
and you're not a junkie.

47:20.968 --> 47:22.877
Brody wants to promote you.

47:22.928 --> 47:25.845
Give you more responsibility.
Interested?

47:25.889 --> 47:27.882
Yeah, yeah!

47:27.933 --> 47:29.972
Shit, yeah, man.

47:31.978 --> 47:34.185
(Indistinct)

47:34.230 --> 47:36.721
Brody says,
you fuck him, I kill you.

47:36.775 --> 47:39.063
-I got that.
-Remember that.

47:42.822 --> 47:44.945
Shit! You got a white driver!

47:51.830 --> 47:53.704
-(Gunshots)
-Fuck!

47:55.918 --> 47:58.243
-What the fuck?
-(Dog barking)

47:58.295 --> 48:00.786
(Police siren wailing)

48:07.554 --> 48:09.214
Don't move!

48:43.004 --> 48:45.293
I love you, Harry.

48:48.551 --> 48:50.793
You make me feel like a person.

48:53.431 --> 48:56.266
like I'm me...

48:57.977 --> 48:59.850
and I'm beautiful.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.603
You are beautiful.

49:07.903 --> 49:11.318
You're the most
beautiful girl in the world.

49:12.866 --> 49:15.024
You're my dream.

49:21.290 --> 49:24.706
(Nurse) 'No, I'm certain.
I've checked again.'

49:24.752 --> 49:28.037
But maybe you gave me
a weaker one last time.

49:28.088 --> 49:31.872
'That isn't possible.
They're all the same potency.'

49:31.925 --> 49:34.001
But something isn't the same.

49:34.428 --> 49:39.220
'You're becoming adjusted to them.
It's nothing to worry about, OK?'

49:39.266 --> 49:40.724
(Click)

49:57.450 --> 49:59.905
-'We got a winner!'
-'We got a winner!'

49:59.952 --> 50:03.321
'She's beautiful,
with a winning sense of humour

50:03.372 --> 50:04.949
'and magical smile.

50:04.998 --> 50:08.663
'From Brighton Beach, Brooklyn,
let's welcome

50:08.710 --> 50:10.370
'Mrs Sara Goldfarb!'

50:10.420 --> 50:15.046
(Audience) 'Juice by Sara!
Juice by Sara! Ohh, Sara!

50:15.091 --> 50:20.086
'Sara's got juice!
Sara's got juice! Ohh, Sara!'

50:20.138 --> 50:22.759
(Crash)

50:28.437 --> 50:31.355
-(Door opens)
-(Guard) love, Tyrone C.

50:31.398 --> 50:34.068
Get your shit together.
You made bail.

50:34.109 --> 50:35.769
How much?

50:35.819 --> 50:39.235
Most of our cash.
You're up for consortin'.

50:39.281 --> 50:41.155
oh, shit, man!

50:41.199 --> 50:45.113
Angel says there's a war
between the Italians and Blacks.

50:45.161 --> 50:49.455
Sal the Geep is keeping the shit
in Florida until Brody's gone.

50:49.499 --> 50:50.530
Shit.

50:50.583 --> 50:53.501
-No one's got a thing.
-Except Big Tim.

50:53.544 --> 50:55.501
Shit. let's go see him.

50:55.546 --> 50:58.464
He only givin' up for pussy.

50:58.507 --> 51:00.050
What?

51:00.092 --> 51:02.879
Pussy. He's hooked on it, man.

51:02.928 --> 51:06.511
I'd give him all he wants.
He said I ain't cute enough.

51:18.401 --> 51:21.438
(Tappy on TV)
'Come on, number three!

51:21.488 --> 51:25.437
(Speaking very slowly)
'This drives most people crazy.

51:25.491 --> 51:27.448
'They're not gonna like it.

51:27.493 --> 51:31.158
'This is easy so far!
Give it up for 30 days, it will...'

51:41.340 --> 51:43.000
(Gasps)

51:44.551 --> 51:46.425
(Harry) You all right?

51:49.139 --> 51:51.712
Yeah. It was just a bad dream.

51:53.059 --> 51:54.767
Want some water?

52:16.498 --> 52:18.372
Maybe we should dip in now.

52:18.417 --> 52:21.287
Come on! I already told you,
all right?

52:23.254 --> 52:25.081
It's all we have.

52:25.131 --> 52:28.251
Tyrone is gonna score
in the morning, Harry.

52:33.890 --> 52:35.763
I don't know, it's...

52:35.808 --> 52:37.682
it's a bitch out there.

52:39.603 --> 52:41.643
It'll be OK.

52:43.607 --> 52:45.564
It'll be OK, Harry.

52:49.696 --> 52:51.902
(Sighs) Yeah...

52:51.948 --> 52:53.775
I guess so.

53:00.623 --> 53:02.829
I love you, Harry.

53:41.328 --> 53:45.373
(Talking very fast) What's
the problem? The weight's fine.

53:45.416 --> 53:47.788
The weight's fine, I'm not.

53:48.919 --> 53:50.995
The refrigerator...

53:51.046 --> 53:52.505
(Crash)

53:52.547 --> 53:54.421
Something wrong?

53:56.676 --> 53:58.420
Everything's...

54:02.807 --> 54:04.847
all mixed up.

54:04.892 --> 54:07.562
-Confused...
-Nothing to worry about.

54:07.603 --> 54:10.806
Get this filled.
Make an appointment for a week.

54:20.157 --> 54:21.568
Well?.

54:22.701 --> 54:24.907
Ty ain't found nothin' yet.

54:26.872 --> 54:28.745
What are we gonna do?

54:28.790 --> 54:30.747
I don't know.

54:30.792 --> 54:33.461
Well, you have
to do something, Harry.

54:33.503 --> 54:35.828
It's your fault
we don't have anything.

54:35.880 --> 54:40.043
-What?
-You were all hot last night.

54:40.092 --> 54:43.960
-That is such bullshit!
-We could've had something...

54:44.013 --> 54:47.927
Was I supposed to watch you
push off and not go myself?

54:47.975 --> 54:50.098
Don't put it all on me, OK?

54:53.814 --> 54:55.059
(Door slams)

55:01.279 --> 55:04.565
Don't worry, man.
We'll fill it up again.

55:05.617 --> 55:07.490
Things'll get better,

55:07.535 --> 55:11.070
then we'll be fillin'
the box back up, you know?

55:17.962 --> 55:20.916
(Tyrone) So,
you wanna hear the news?

55:20.965 --> 55:22.838
(Harry) What news?

55:22.883 --> 55:26.583
(Tyrone) You got your good news,
you got your bad news.

55:26.637 --> 55:28.297
Shoot.

55:28.347 --> 55:30.220
Good news is,

55:30.265 --> 55:33.219
there's gonna be
some prime on the street.

55:34.269 --> 55:36.890
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

55:36.938 --> 55:39.014
Who told you that?

55:40.149 --> 55:42.308
-Angel.
-Yeah?

55:42.360 --> 55:46.820
Sal the Geep sent word to let
a couple of keys go for Christmas,

55:46.864 --> 55:49.022
him being a good Christian and all,

55:49.075 --> 55:52.159
not wantin' bad feelin'
during the season.

55:52.203 --> 55:54.740
-You believe it?
-Well, I did...

55:54.788 --> 55:56.781
till I heard the bad news.

55:56.832 --> 55:58.789
(Footsteps)

56:02.629 --> 56:04.420
(Harry) Yeah?

56:04.464 --> 56:07.381
Price is double.
You have to cop for weight.

56:07.425 --> 56:10.759
-At least a half a piece.
-How much?

56:12.013 --> 56:14.005
-Two.
-Two?

56:14.057 --> 56:17.141
-That's fuckin' insane!
-What you gonna do?

56:17.185 --> 56:19.758
Man ain't gonna
lay no nickel bag on ya.

56:19.812 --> 56:21.639
Where we gonna get two?

56:21.689 --> 56:23.847
You mean Arnold?

56:23.899 --> 56:27.813
Well, your parents
won't even return your call.

56:29.196 --> 56:31.188
I haven't seen him in months.

56:31.240 --> 56:35.284
-So? He's still callin', ain't he?
-I don't know.

56:36.745 --> 56:39.532
look, I don't know what else to do.

56:39.581 --> 56:42.451
It's our last chance
to get back on track!

56:42.500 --> 56:46.118
We won't have to make
the freezing scene every day!

56:48.464 --> 56:50.338
We need the bread.

56:50.383 --> 56:53.965
Getting the money
is not the problem, Harry.

56:54.011 --> 56:56.169
What is the problem?

56:56.222 --> 56:59.175
I don't know
what I'll have to do to get it.

57:06.189 --> 57:07.849
look...

57:07.899 --> 57:09.607
Baby...

57:11.236 --> 57:13.774
we'll be back in business
in no time.

57:14.822 --> 57:17.064
We'll start movin' again,

57:17.116 --> 57:19.358
and we'll start savin'.

57:21.120 --> 57:25.533
It'll be perfect, just like it was.
I promise, Marion.

57:29.295 --> 57:30.954
You'll see.

57:39.638 --> 57:45.094
No, I've just, uh...I've had this
flu forever, it seems like.

57:46.561 --> 57:49.977
-Are you depressed?
-No, it's nothing like that.

57:50.023 --> 57:52.774
I've been, uh...
I've been really busy.

57:52.817 --> 57:56.601
Actually,
I've been designing...non-stop.

57:56.654 --> 58:00.272
Wonderful.
Glad to hear you've been productive.

58:05.078 --> 58:06.952
To be perfectly frank,

58:06.997 --> 58:09.867
I was a little surprised
to hear from you.

58:13.169 --> 58:17.381
-Is there something wrong?
-No. Why?

58:17.424 --> 58:22.844
Well, it's usually the case...
from someone you haven't heard from.

58:23.596 --> 58:25.589
Everything's fine.

58:29.351 --> 58:31.143
Actually,

58:35.065 --> 58:37.224
I have a favour to ask.

58:41.405 --> 58:43.064
(Screaming)

58:43.115 --> 58:46.318
You smug fuck!

58:46.368 --> 58:48.159
What is it?

58:53.333 --> 58:55.124
I need some money.

58:55.168 --> 58:57.456
May I ask what for?

58:59.213 --> 59:03.376
-Could you turn the light off?
-Why do you want the light off?

59:03.425 --> 59:05.383
I just do.

59:06.470 --> 59:09.305
-You never did before.
-Please, Arnold.

59:33.829 --> 59:36.700
(Indistinct commentary)

1:00:29.924 --> 1:00:31.584
(Door slams)

1:00:46.273 --> 1:00:48.147
(lift bell rings)

1:01:18.095 --> 1:01:20.171
(Thunder crashes)

1:02:38.713 --> 1:02:41.286
-Where is everybody?
-I don't know, man.

1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:44.507
All Angel said
was meet at Waldbaum's.

1:02:47.721 --> 1:02:51.386
-Is this the right Waldbaum's?
-Yeah, I'm positive.

1:02:52.643 --> 1:02:56.177
You just watch my back,
and I'll watch yours.

1:02:59.733 --> 1:03:02.437
-What are we supposed to do now?
-Hey.

1:03:15.206 --> 1:03:17.245
Everyone and their mother.

1:03:19.001 --> 1:03:21.456
The truck's gonna be here.
Back up.

1:03:24.339 --> 1:03:25.668
Back up.

1:03:31.930 --> 1:03:34.053
(All cheering)

1:03:39.938 --> 1:03:42.559
(Cheering)

1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:27.101
(Arguing)

1:04:45.124 --> 1:04:47.331
(Horn honking)

1:04:49.295 --> 1:04:51.169
Come back!

1:04:53.758 --> 1:04:58.087
Stupid fuckin' junkie!
We're fucked! We are fucked.

1:04:58.137 --> 1:05:00.295
Sitting in that hot-ass sun

1:05:00.347 --> 1:05:03.716
while we sit here ass deep
in motherfuckin' snow.

1:05:07.521 --> 1:05:09.394
What if we went down there?

1:05:09.439 --> 1:05:12.144
-Are you serious?
-Why not?

1:05:12.192 --> 1:05:14.184
What the fuck are you sayin'?

1:05:14.235 --> 1:05:18.612
We ask some room clerk at some hotel
for a connection?

1:05:18.656 --> 1:05:22.606
You saying you can't nose out
some dope when it's around?

1:05:22.660 --> 1:05:25.577
Man, we got nothin' to lose.
It's wide open.

1:05:25.621 --> 1:05:29.666
And if we get there right away
we can name our own price,

1:05:29.708 --> 1:05:32.911
and have those fools
cover the street for us.

1:05:35.172 --> 1:05:39.833
Yeah, man. last summer was
a motherfuckin' ball, huh, Jim?

1:05:44.097 --> 1:05:48.260
Just seems like a thousand years ago
since last summer, man.

1:05:48.309 --> 1:05:50.432
It'll be like that again, man.

1:05:54.523 --> 1:05:57.014
I could get Angel
to get us a short...

1:05:57.068 --> 1:05:59.819
if we promise him
some dynamite scag.

1:05:59.862 --> 1:06:01.356
(Chuckles)

1:06:03.449 --> 1:06:05.488
(Distant beeping)

1:06:24.385 --> 1:06:26.045
(Beeping)

1:06:28.264 --> 1:06:29.722
(Beeping fades)

1:06:39.274 --> 1:06:41.563
(Beeping)

1:07:06.550 --> 1:07:08.839
(Crash)

1:07:17.352 --> 1:07:19.843
Thank God. Where have you been?

1:07:19.896 --> 1:07:22.434
Where the hell you think I've been?

1:07:23.274 --> 1:07:26.477
-Where's the score?
-We had a bit of a problem.

1:07:26.527 --> 1:07:30.395
I mean, everything was goin' good,
and then...

1:07:30.448 --> 1:07:33.021
-some dumb-ass junkie...
-Did what?

1:07:33.075 --> 1:07:36.491
Some dumb-ass junkie did what?!
You fucked up?!

1:07:36.537 --> 1:07:40.914
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-You promised it was gonna be OK.

1:07:40.958 --> 1:07:44.872
I fucked that sleaze-bag.
I put myself through hell for you!

1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:49.665
-There's nothing out there!
-I don't give a shit! Fucking loser!

1:07:52.343 --> 1:07:54.799
You wanna be sure
we have some extra?

1:07:54.846 --> 1:07:57.763
Ty told me about a guy
holding some weight.

1:07:57.807 --> 1:08:00.013
But he ain't sellin' it!

1:08:00.059 --> 1:08:02.052
(Ty) 'Yeah?'

1:08:02.103 --> 1:08:04.854
-Gimme that guy's number.
-'What guy?'

1:08:04.897 --> 1:08:07.388
-The guy who likes broads!
-'Why?'

1:08:07.441 --> 1:08:09.350
Just gimme the number!

1:08:09.401 --> 1:08:13.269
'All right. 934-8777.'

1:08:14.948 --> 1:08:18.566
You worried so much,
go fix yourself up with him!

1:08:18.618 --> 1:08:23.364
You won't have to fuckin' wait
and I won't freeze my ass off!

1:08:23.415 --> 1:08:25.241
-Fuck you.
-(Door slams)

1:08:50.232 --> 1:08:52.271
(Crash)

1:08:59.490 --> 1:09:01.816
'All right, we got a winner.'

1:09:01.868 --> 1:09:04.785
-'We got a winner.'
-'We got a winner.'

1:09:04.829 --> 1:09:07.450
-'We got a winner.'
-'We got a winner.'

'She's beautiful, with a winning
sense of humour and smile.

-Could you do any better?

1:10:40.670 --> 1:10:42.579
look at this.

1:10:42.630 --> 1:10:46.627
It's an old building.
It hasn't been painted in years.

1:10:46.675 --> 1:10:49.380
I'm old! Alone!

1:10:49.428 --> 1:10:51.634
You don't understand.

What are you doing?
Get away from me!

-( # latin American music)
-What am I supposed to do ?

1:12:27.521 --> 1:12:28.980

Whoo-hoo!

1:13:42.425 --> 1:13:47.383
Sure hope this motherfucker works.
My ass could use some heat.

1:13:47.430 --> 1:13:51.510
-How long this trip's gonna take?
-We'll make it in a day.

1:13:51.559 --> 1:13:53.682
A day? Shit!

1:13:53.728 --> 1:13:56.135
California, here we come.

1:13:56.188 --> 1:13:58.347
It's Florida, Ty. Florida.

1:13:58.399 --> 1:14:00.142
California, Florida...

1:14:00.192 --> 1:14:03.027
Either way,
your pale ass getting a tan.

1:14:03.070 --> 1:14:05.477
(Gasps) Ah!

1:14:06.573 --> 1:14:09.693
Does this train
go to Madison Avenue?!

1:14:09.743 --> 1:14:11.700
Do you know Maylin and Block?

1:14:11.745 --> 1:14:15.114
I have their address.
It's on Madison Avenue.

1:14:15.165 --> 1:14:18.830
-I'm gonna be on television.
-You're whacked!

1:14:20.545 --> 1:14:23.415
Hey! Hey! Hello?

1:14:23.464 --> 1:14:27.414
Do you know if this train
goes to Madison Avenue?

1:14:27.468 --> 1:14:30.338
I'm gonna be on television!

1:14:31.764 --> 1:14:34.255
I just have to find out when.

1:14:35.851 --> 1:14:37.559
Florida?

1:14:40.772 --> 1:14:42.895
When is he gonna be back?

1:14:44.484 --> 1:14:48.813
A few days?
Angel, what am I supposed to do?

1:14:49.948 --> 1:14:52.024
Please, you gotta help me.

1:14:52.075 --> 1:14:55.029
oh, come on, I can get you money.

1:14:56.120 --> 1:14:59.869
Angel, there's gotta be something.
Anything. Help me.

1:14:59.915 --> 1:15:02.620
Why aren't you calling me?

1:15:02.668 --> 1:15:06.251
I have to know when
I'm gonna be on television.

1:15:07.381 --> 1:15:10.168
I'm Sara Goldfarb.

1:15:10.217 --> 1:15:14.380
And you should tell me
when I'm gonna be on television.

1:15:14.429 --> 1:15:17.050
Just sit for a moment.
I'll ring them.

1:15:17.098 --> 1:15:19.506
I just wanna know when.

1:15:19.559 --> 1:15:24.933
Maybe you lost my card! Please,
have a look, and you'll tell me.

1:15:24.981 --> 1:15:29.939
It's not the prizes.
I'll give them away. (Chuckles)

1:15:29.986 --> 1:15:32.144
I just wanna be on the show.

1:15:32.196 --> 1:15:34.604
I've waited so long...

1:15:34.657 --> 1:15:39.365
to be on with my Harry
and my grandson.

1:15:39.411 --> 1:15:41.902
Here, Mrs Goldfarb, sip this.

1:15:41.955 --> 1:15:46.451
Sometimes it takes a while to get
called for a show, Mrs Goldfarb.

1:15:46.501 --> 1:15:49.952
-Oh. Oooh.
-(Door opens)

1:15:52.132 --> 1:15:54.041
-Is this her?
-Yes.

1:15:54.092 --> 1:15:58.421
-Can you walk?
-I'm walkin' across the stage!

1:15:58.471 --> 1:16:02.054
And you should see
my Harry on television.

1:16:02.099 --> 1:16:04.306
We're giving the prizes away.

1:16:04.352 --> 1:16:08.301
(Sobbing) I just wanted
to be on the show!

1:16:09.732 --> 1:16:13.978
-(Paramedic) What's her name?
-We think it's Sara Goldfarb.

1:16:14.027 --> 1:16:17.728
Tell Seymour to meet me
at the beauty parlour.

1:16:17.781 --> 1:16:21.825
I've got the red dress that
I wore to Harry's graduation.

1:16:21.868 --> 1:16:24.276
oK, Mrs Goldfarb. Here we go.

1:16:24.329 --> 1:16:26.998
-(laughs)
-One, two, three...

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:29.447
let's take it nice and easy.

1:16:40.594 --> 1:16:42.670
(Dial tone)

1:16:42.721 --> 1:16:45.010
(Dialling)

1:16:50.687 --> 1:16:52.763

-(Whispers) Hi...
-(Chuckling)

1:17:28.014 --> 1:17:31.430
Tell Rose I'm going
to be on television.

1:17:36.022 --> 1:17:38.098
(Siren wailing)

1:17:46.323 --> 1:17:48.363
(Sighs)

1:17:48.409 --> 1:17:50.282
Whoo.

1:17:59.461 --> 1:18:01.169
oh, shit!

1:18:01.212 --> 1:18:03.750
God damn! How long you had that?

1:18:03.798 --> 1:18:08.460
-Just a few days.
-That shit don't look too good.

1:18:08.511 --> 1:18:10.918
It don't feel too good either, man.

1:18:12.181 --> 1:18:15.764
But a little stuff
will take care of that.

1:18:15.809 --> 1:18:17.849
Hey! Don't shoot in there!

1:18:17.895 --> 1:18:20.220
I'll blow it if I don't.

1:18:21.064 --> 1:18:22.724
Fuck it.

1:18:31.825 --> 1:18:33.402
oh...

1:18:35.119 --> 1:18:36.614
Shit.

1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:49.299
(Buzzer)

1:18:52.052 --> 1:18:55.219
-Hi, how are you? Can you hear me?
-Yes, Seymour.

1:18:55.264 --> 1:18:58.798
-Take anything?
-I took my red dress and...

1:18:58.850 --> 1:19:01.555
-No emergency. Take her to psych.
-Television.

1:19:12.655 --> 1:19:14.315
Come on in.

1:19:17.243 --> 1:19:18.701
Thanks.

1:19:24.083 --> 1:19:25.909
What's your name?

1:19:27.961 --> 1:19:29.621
Marion.

1:19:29.671 --> 1:19:31.628
Well, what do you know?

1:19:31.673 --> 1:19:33.582
Maid Marion.

1:19:34.843 --> 1:19:36.123
(Chuckles)

1:19:40.056 --> 1:19:42.262
I'm little John.

1:19:45.144 --> 1:19:46.638
Beautiful view.

1:19:46.687 --> 1:19:49.392
You know what I like
about paddy chicks?

1:19:50.608 --> 1:19:53.312
They give good head. (Chuckles)

1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:56.065
Black broads
know nothin' about head.

1:19:56.113 --> 1:19:57.987
I don't know why.

1:19:58.031 --> 1:20:01.649
Maybe it's to do
with some ancient tribal custom.

1:20:01.702 --> 1:20:03.575
(Chuckling)

1:20:06.706 --> 1:20:08.782
Come here.

1:20:21.429 --> 1:20:24.797
Mmm. Better save
some of that energy.

1:20:41.906 --> 1:20:44.444
oh, I know it's pretty, baby,

1:20:44.492 --> 1:20:46.485
but I didn't take it out for air.

1:20:57.087 --> 1:20:59.329
Yeah. (Chuckles)

1:21:03.677 --> 1:21:07.295
I told your ass,
stay away from that arm. See?

1:21:08.932 --> 1:21:11.090
I gotta call Marion, man.

1:21:11.142 --> 1:21:14.392
That's about to be
a long-distance call now.

1:21:14.437 --> 1:21:19.265
That's 600 miles!
We are 600 miles closer to Miami.

1:21:19.317 --> 1:21:22.982
It's also 600 miles
further away from New York.

1:21:28.284 --> 1:21:30.774
I know where to get
a real nice taste,

1:21:30.828 --> 1:21:33.745
though it's more like play.
Sunday night?

1:21:33.789 --> 1:21:37.454
We're throwing a little gathering.
All good people.

1:21:37.501 --> 1:21:39.624
I can't, I'm busy.

1:21:39.669 --> 1:21:41.958
Anyway, I'm not really hooked.

1:21:42.005 --> 1:21:45.255
Oh, I know,
but it's a real nice taste.

1:21:51.639 --> 1:21:53.964
I'll see you Sunday, Maid Marion.

1:21:55.559 --> 1:21:58.264
OK, just try
and answer my questions.

1:21:58.312 --> 1:22:03.188
-When did you start taking pills?
-Oh, the summer.

1:22:03.233 --> 1:22:07.231
-You started last summer?
-I got the best place in the sun.

1:22:07.279 --> 1:22:11.276
-Ada fixed my hair.
-Everything is gonna be all right.

1:22:11.324 --> 1:22:13.815
We'll get you fixed up in no time.

1:22:32.386 --> 1:22:35.138
(Screaming)

1:22:35.180 --> 1:22:38.098
-Hold tight, man.
-I can't fucking cut it.

1:22:38.141 --> 1:22:40.467
I gotta do something about my arm.

1:22:40.519 --> 1:22:42.392
let me see what it looks like.

1:22:49.569 --> 1:22:51.894
oh, damn, Jim!

1:22:53.072 --> 1:22:54.531
oh, man.

1:22:54.574 --> 1:22:57.278
That's one ugly motherfucker.

1:22:57.326 --> 1:22:59.948
-I gotta call Marion.
-Fuck that.

1:22:59.996 --> 1:23:02.665
We gotta get you to a hospital, man.

1:23:07.711 --> 1:23:09.454
What is that?

1:23:09.505 --> 1:23:13.123
I don't want that.
I don't want that!

1:23:13.175 --> 1:23:15.463
Ah! Oh...

1:23:21.891 --> 1:23:24.263
(Heavy footsteps)

1:23:28.606 --> 1:23:31.523
-(Phone)
-(Groaning)

1:23:51.586 --> 1:23:53.662
What's the problem?

1:23:53.713 --> 1:23:57.841
-It's my arm. My arm is killin' me.
-let's have a look at it.

1:23:58.926 --> 1:24:00.551
(Gasping)

1:24:01.971 --> 1:24:03.465
All right.

1:24:07.768 --> 1:24:09.677
I'll be back in a minute.

1:24:36.462 --> 1:24:38.620
I wanna play blackjack
all night long.

1:24:38.672 --> 1:24:43.583
So I make up this routine. I say,
"you go ahead. I don't feel good."

1:24:43.635 --> 1:24:45.675
Sure enough, they leave...

1:24:45.721 --> 1:24:48.093
Ready? One, two and three.

1:24:49.808 --> 1:24:51.966
As soon as they leave,

1:24:52.018 --> 1:24:55.518
I go running back to the casino,
sit at my blackjack table.

1:24:55.563 --> 1:24:57.639
I am there for the whole night.

1:24:57.690 --> 1:25:03.645
Finally, I get up so big, I got
five $100 black chips in my pocket.

1:25:03.696 --> 1:25:06.317
I swear to God.
The hours are going by.

1:25:06.365 --> 1:25:10.315
I'm laying back, hittin' on
hard 17 s. It was beautiful.

1:25:10.369 --> 1:25:12.611
-(Groaning)
-Next thing I know,

1:25:12.663 --> 1:25:17.490
this security guard is sitting there
telling me I have to leave.

1:25:17.543 --> 1:25:20.911
I'm like, "Why you telling me
I have to leave?"

1:25:20.962 --> 1:25:23.418
He says,
"You have to leave because..."

1:25:23.465 --> 1:25:25.541
(Continues indistinct)

1:25:29.137 --> 1:25:30.797
Swallow.

1:25:34.434 --> 1:25:37.185
(Slowly) Swallow.

1:25:45.069 --> 1:25:47.441
(Indistinct announcement on PA)

1:25:54.077 --> 1:25:56.485
(Footsteps approaching)

1:26:06.631 --> 1:26:10.498
You have to eat. If we're gonna
get you healthy you have to eat.

1:26:10.551 --> 1:26:15.094
Work with the attendants.
I'm gonna try some new medications.

1:26:18.559 --> 1:26:21.050
(Groaning)

1:26:36.451 --> 1:26:39.155
(Groaning)

1:26:49.964 --> 1:26:52.715
(Muffled screaming)

1:27:06.855 --> 1:27:08.930
(Phone ringing)

1:27:17.615 --> 1:27:19.773
-Hello.
-(Harry) 'Marion.'

1:27:21.327 --> 1:27:23.034
Harry?

1:27:23.746 --> 1:27:28.241
'Marion, I've been
thinking about you so much.

1:27:28.292 --> 1:27:30.118
'Are you OK?'

1:27:33.088 --> 1:27:37.037
-When you comin' home?
-Soon.

1:27:37.092 --> 1:27:38.586
When?

1:27:40.094 --> 1:27:41.553
Soon.

1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:46.179
-'You holdin' out all right?'
-Harry?

1:27:48.102 --> 1:27:50.474
Can you come today?

1:27:54.233 --> 1:27:56.724
(Sighs) Yeah.

1:27:58.278 --> 1:28:00.485
(Sobbing)

1:28:03.074 --> 1:28:05.032
I'll come.

1:28:05.076 --> 1:28:08.445
(Sobbing) 'I'll come today.'

1:28:13.042 --> 1:28:16.209
You just wait for me, all right?

1:28:19.340 --> 1:28:22.875
-OK, Harry.
-'I'm coming back, Marion.'

1:28:22.927 --> 1:28:24.800
-Yeah.
-'Marion?'

1:28:24.845 --> 1:28:26.256
Yeah?

1:28:27.389 --> 1:28:30.094
I'm really sorry, Marion.

1:28:30.142 --> 1:28:32.015
I know.

1:28:34.062 --> 1:28:35.936
(Phone beeps off)

1:28:41.152 --> 1:28:43.109
(Doctor) Mrs Goldfarb?

1:28:45.156 --> 1:28:46.947
You all right?

1:28:48.493 --> 1:28:54.162
Um, so, Mrs Goldfarb,
we've tried several medications,

1:28:54.206 --> 1:28:56.697
and you don't seem to be responding.

1:28:56.750 --> 1:29:00.795
I believe we might want to try
some alternative methods.

1:29:00.838 --> 1:29:04.752
We've had excellent results
with ECT in the past.

1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:07.125
Um... So if I can just...

1:29:07.177 --> 1:29:09.846
get your John Hancock...

1:29:11.139 --> 1:29:12.930
we'll get underway.

1:29:12.974 --> 1:29:14.468
Great. Thanks.

1:29:15.727 --> 1:29:18.811
(Groaning) Oh, Jesus Christ!

1:29:18.855 --> 1:29:21.227
I need a doctor, man.

1:29:21.274 --> 1:29:24.477
My friend is sick.
Give him some help, please.

1:29:24.527 --> 1:29:28.192
I can't take it, man!
My arm! My fuckin' arm!

1:29:29.615 --> 1:29:31.607

1:29:31.658 --> 1:29:36.071
Help us!
Somebody fuckin' help us, please!

1:29:50.885 --> 1:29:53.590

1:30:59.200 --> 1:31:00.610
(Screams)

1:31:00.659 --> 1:31:03.494

-Marion?
-Who's that?

1:33:54.616 --> 1:33:56.858
