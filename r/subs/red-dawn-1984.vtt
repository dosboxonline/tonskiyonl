WEBVTT

00:05.500 --> 00:07.667
[Lion roaring]

02:45.458 --> 02:49.000
[Vehicle approaching]

02:51.917 --> 02:54.208
- Ah... thanks for the ride.
- 0kay.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.559
- Thanks, bud.
- So, what's the deal?

02:55.583 --> 02:57.303
Get going. We don't
have time for breakfast.

02:57.375 --> 02:58.875
Are you, uh, working, or what?

02:59.042 --> 03:00.518
Yeah, I'll be at the station all day,

03:00.542 --> 03:02.222
so you're gonna have to hitch a ride home.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.559
- All right.
- You got practice today?

03:03.583 --> 03:05.667
After that, man, we're on double time.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.873
- Triple.
- [Jed] You should be ashamed of yourself.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.143
You'd think they'd take it down.

03:09.167 --> 03:12.542
Come on, bud. You lost
a football game once yourself.

03:12.708 --> 03:16.125
- What? I don't remember.
- I do.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.792
I think you're lying.

03:17.958 --> 03:19.143
- [Aardvark] Catch you later.
- [Matt] Yeah. See you!

03:19.167 --> 03:20.309
I never know when to believe your mouth!

03:20.333 --> 03:21.750
[Matt] Yeah, likewise.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.333
- Later, bud.
- See you, jed.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.625
- So, did you do your history?
- Yeah. Some of it.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.792
[Teacher] The great hunt
would always begin

03:34.958 --> 03:36.917
with the armies spread out

03:37.083 --> 03:41.083
in a semi-circle, I would say
about the size of Rhode Island.

03:41.250 --> 03:45.750
Then they would ride forward,
driving everything before them.

03:46.750 --> 03:47.958
Beast

03:48.125 --> 03:49.458
men,

03:49.875 --> 03:50.875
even bugs.

03:52.917 --> 03:56.875
Now, the ends would kinda close in
to form a shrinking circle,

03:57.583 --> 04:00.500
and everything within that circle
panicked to get out.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.208
So when the mongols could see each other,

04:03.833 --> 04:07.333
they had worked themselves up
into a pretty good frenzy.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.000
Now, when this killing started,

04:12.250 --> 04:15.750
it'd last for days, weeks,

04:16.458 --> 04:18.083
even months.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.583
And it went on

04:21.333 --> 04:24.417
until the young son of the Khan

04:25.375 --> 04:28.375
asked his father
that the last creature alive...

04:29.042 --> 04:31.333
[Rumbling in distance]

04:34.042 --> 04:36.167
Be allowed to...

04:36.917 --> 04:38.667
Go free.

04:40.292 --> 04:42.042
Well, now, my friend.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.542
Well, now.

04:44.708 --> 04:45.833
[Girl] They're all over.

04:46.167 --> 04:47.375
[Boy] Oh, check it out.

04:47.583 --> 04:51.167
- [Indistinct chatter]
- [Men shouting in distance]

04:51.333 --> 04:53.013
[Boy 2] They look pretty cool,
though, man.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.583
[Teacher] I would say
they were way off-course.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.083
This is very unusual.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.333
[Soldiers speaking Russian]

05:02.583 --> 05:04.625
[Boy] You do something, Mr. Teasdale.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.167
[Soldiers speaking Russian]

05:21.292 --> 05:22.768
[Boy] He wants to see their hall pass.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.167
[Soldiers speaking Russian]

05:24.333 --> 05:25.792
What's going on here, my friend?

05:25.958 --> 05:27.038
[Soldiers speaking Russian]

05:27.125 --> 05:28.125
[Gunshots]

05:28.292 --> 05:29.917

Come on, let's go!

06:05.333 --> 06:07.167
[Gunshots]

06:16.000 --> 06:19.083
[Indistinct shouting]

Get in!

06:27.417 --> 06:28.625
Get down! Get down!

06:31.208 --> 06:32.875
- [Jed] Get in!
- [Aardvark] Wait! Hey!

06:33.042 --> 06:34.208
[Jed] Get down!

[Robert] Dad! Dad!

07:59.292 --> 08:00.893
- Dad, they're attacking.
- What's happening? What's happening?

08:00.917 --> 08:02.768
They were shooting at me.
They're shooting at everybody!

08:02.792 --> 08:04.392
- Shooting at you?
- [Jet engine roaring]

08:08.167 --> 08:09.976
We're going to the mountains.
We're getting out of here.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.434
[Mr. Morris] Who are they,
near as you can tell?

08:11.458 --> 08:13.434
[Boy] I heard some of 'em
speaking Spanish, Mr. Morris.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.351
- [Mr. Morris] Did you see any of 'em?
- [Boy 2] With Spain?

08:15.375 --> 08:16.601
[Robert] I want to stay with you.

08:16.625 --> 08:17.917
[Explosion]

08:18.083 --> 08:21.875
- [Mr. Morris] Who are they?
- 0h, my god! Oh, my god!

08:22.292 --> 08:23.893
- [Mr. Morris] Just take it easy.
- [Robert] No...

08:23.917 --> 08:27.458
Boys, get in there,
and get sleeping bags and food.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.417
Right now. Come on.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.102
- Hurry up, boys. Come on, son.
- [Boy] Let's go. Let's move it.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.101
[Mr. Morris] Take the dry stuff!

08:34.125 --> 08:35.476
Don't mess around with
a lot of candies or cookies.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.659
- [Jed] Get the dehydrated stuff!
- [Boy] Got it, yeah.

08:38.125 --> 08:41.375
[Boy 2] Plenty of kleenex!
Somebody, get some lanterns!

08:41.542 --> 08:42.942
[Boy 3] And grab some toilet paper!

08:43.082 --> 08:44.375
I ain't gonna use no leaves!

08:44.542 --> 08:46.542
[Indistinct chattering]

08:50.875 --> 08:53.636
[Mr. Morris] Take a lot of batteries!
All the batteries you can carry!

08:54.750 --> 08:58.083
- Take the shotgun there.
- [Boy] Get those down jackets.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.375
[Aardvark] Matt, look!

09:02.042 --> 09:04.202

get down, get down, get down!

09:04.583 --> 09:07.667
- [Helicopter approaching]
- Lay down!

09:13.292 --> 09:14.333
[Matt] Is it ours?

09:18.583 --> 09:20.309
- [Mr. Morris] I love you, boy.
- [Robert] I love you, dad.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.333
Tell mom I love her.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.250
- Yeah.
- [Jed] I'll take care of him.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.333
All right, come on, boys.
Just get outta here. Come on.

09:26.958 --> 09:28.708
And don't come back here.

09:29.417 --> 09:31.625
No matter what you see or hear,
don't come back.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.500
I'll come and get you soon enough.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.667
Open the glove compartment.

09:45.958 --> 09:47.583
- Is it there?
- Yeah.

09:48.042 --> 09:49.292
Load it.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.875
- It's already loaded.
- Give it here.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.792
- You want these also, jed?
- Yeah, put 'em in my pocket.

10:08.708 --> 10:09.708

- [Matt] Oh, my god!
- 0h, Jesus! Oh, Jesus!

10:12.667 --> 10:14.125
We're gonna turn off quick.

10:47.833 --> 10:50.625
- It's ours!
- [All cheering]

10:51.625 --> 10:52.833
Get in! Get in!

10:55.417 --> 10:56.417
It's ours!

11:05.375 --> 11:06.875
- Did you get it?
- [Jed] Yeah.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.708
That's got it. Only thing is,
we got one problem.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.542
We don't have any water.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.583
How about pissing in it?

11:17.750 --> 11:19.333
[Laughs]

11:19.500 --> 11:21.208
That's a good idea. Get up here.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.059
- How do you know it'll work?
- C'mon. Get up here.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.708
- How old are you, kid?
- 15.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.833
And the name's Danny, not "kid."

11:28.250 --> 11:32.083
Well, when you, uh, grow up,
you'll know these things, Danny.

11:32.250 --> 11:35.375
Now, get up here and piss in the radiator.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.708
[Soldiers speaking Russian]

[In Spanish]

13:14.958 --> 13:16.500
[In Russian]

13:38.417 --> 13:42.167
[Danny] But our families, huh?
What about them? Huh?

13:43.583 --> 13:45.458
[Robert]
We gotta stay up here and hide awhile.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.167
I just wanna go home.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.875
I don't wanna hide.
If I hide, they'll never find me.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.500
Check it out.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.333
It stopped a bullet that would've...
Hit somebody.

14:05.917 --> 14:07.375
I got these.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.560
[Daryl] Those will do us a lot of good.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.458
We've got no radio.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.434
I mean, how long do you think
we can survive up here

14:13.458 --> 14:14.958
on olives and rice krispies?

14:16.250 --> 14:18.167
What else are we gonna do?

14:21.833 --> 14:24.125
As calumet student body president, I...

14:25.375 --> 14:27.958
I forward the motion
that we give ourselves up.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.792
I s... I second the motion.
We can't stay here.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.333
We need stuff and...

14:32.625 --> 14:33.625
Sit down, Danny!

14:37.458 --> 14:39.898
You're not going anywhere.
It's too dangerous to go into town.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.375
- I say we vote on it.
- No.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.750
This isn't the big game, Mr. Quarterback!

14:44.917 --> 14:47.167
- He can go wherever he wants.
- No.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.292
You're such a goddamn jock.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.125
Hey, come on, guys! Knock it off!

14:57.875 --> 15:00.125
You wanna go so bad?
Here, haul ass, take your shit!

15:00.292 --> 15:03.042
[Panting] That goes for the rest of you.

15:05.583 --> 15:06.903
This is your chance. Get walking.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.542
It is world war III down there.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.458
People are being killed.

15:16.417 --> 15:17.750
Those could be Russians.

15:18.917 --> 15:22.208
Jed, what about your family?

15:23.333 --> 15:24.625
Huh?

15:29.667 --> 15:31.417
I don't know.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.083
But I'm alive... and I'm staying here.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.667
My family would want me to stay alive.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.542
Your family would want you to stay alive.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.708
I mean, you think you're so smart, man,

15:46.125 --> 15:48.208
but you're just a bunch of scared kids.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.042
What do you think you are?

15:56.708 --> 15:57.958
Alone, I guess.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.542
No, you're not.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.000
Hey, bud.

16:09.292 --> 16:10.667
What do you say?

16:23.083 --> 16:24.500
[Chuckles]

16:25.083 --> 16:27.542
- I'm with you.
- [Jed] All right.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.292
Now, the rest of you, get going.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.750
All right.

16:41.917 --> 16:45.042
But if you stay, you're gonna do
exactly what I say, okay?

16:51.625 --> 16:53.500
So come on over here and get warm.

16:54.542 --> 16:55.875
Daryl.

17:09.458 --> 17:10.583
Sorry.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.625
Me, too, man.

17:13.750 --> 17:14.958
Okay.

17:18.291 --> 17:21.500
Now, Matt and I have been coming up

17:21.708 --> 17:23.791
in these mountains
with our dad all of our lives.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.208
We can hunt, we can fish,

17:26.375 --> 17:28.291
we can stay up here along, long time.

17:28.833 --> 17:29.833
Okay?

17:30.708 --> 17:34.167
- [Robert] How long, jed?
- [Jet flying overhead]

17:36.875 --> 17:38.958
Until we don't hear that no more.

17:52.042 --> 17:54.500
{gunshofl -i got him!

17:56.417 --> 17:57.750
You got him.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.518
- [Jed] Right, we're gonna eat good.
- He's still breathing!

18:06.542 --> 18:08.708
No, no, no! Never shoot twice!

18:08.875 --> 18:11.042
- Why?
- If you shoot twice, they can find you.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.750
- He's dead, anyway.
- How do you know?

18:19.667 --> 18:23.667
I used to read a lot about
Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger.

18:24.708 --> 18:27.250
The blackfeet, if you shot twice,

18:27.417 --> 18:28.875
would know right where you were.

18:29.750 --> 18:32.000
My dad named me after jed Smith.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.750
This is your first time, isn't it?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.500
Yeah. Why?

18:40.667 --> 18:43.458
You gotta drink,
if it's your first. We did.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.500
What's it taste like?

18:47.250 --> 18:48.458
It's not too bad. I mean,

18:48.625 --> 18:50.042
it's kinda salty, like a steak,

18:50.208 --> 18:52.042
or when you got a nosebleed, you know.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.083
You gotta do it, Robert.
It's the spirit of the deer.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.667
When you drink it,
you'll be a real hunter.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.917
[Matt] Bottoms up.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.542
Go. Go ahead.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.583
[Jed] Go, go for it, buddy!

19:21.917 --> 19:23.625
All right! All right!

19:26.083 --> 19:27.083
[Matt] You did it, man.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.333
[Laughs]

19:28.500 --> 19:31.625
His blood is yours. You know,
my dad said that once you do that,

19:31.792 --> 19:35.500
there's gonna be something
different about you. Always.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.375
It wasn't so bad.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.917
It wasn't that bad.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.042
It wasn't so bad.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.625
That's the last of it,
except for the olives.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.570
We still got plenty of meat left.

20:05.750 --> 20:06.792
Just stuff you shot.

20:07.208 --> 20:09.833
So, tell me, dork, where do you
suppose hamburgers come from?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.333
Nobody shoots them.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.250
We need food.

20:15.542 --> 20:16.542
We need to know.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.250
All right.

20:26.917 --> 20:28.750
We'll go into town.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.625
[Jed] Jesus!

20:59.375 --> 21:01.208
Yeah, there's no one here, either.

21:04.042 --> 21:06.250
Looks like it's been here
for a thousand years.

21:06.917 --> 21:10.000
[Bird calling]

21:13.208 --> 21:14.208
[Jed] Come on.

21:25.583 --> 21:26.833
[Robert] Hey.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.958
Those stores are open.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.583
There's people everywhere.
Maybe it's over.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.417
- Get down!
- Hey! Don't go anywhere.

21:34.583 --> 21:36.042
Those aren't our troops.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.667
You can't tell from here, jed.

21:38.542 --> 21:40.167
Jesus Christ!

21:40.333 --> 21:42.693
[Jed] What is that? I've never
seen a tank like that before.

21:42.833 --> 21:43.958
[Matt] I don't know.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.325
[Robert] Yeah, but they're packed.
That means something.

21:47.042 --> 21:48.500
[Jed] Let's stash our stuff.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.383
- Leave it all here, okay?
- [Matt] Good idea.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.500
That's the mayor's car!

21:58.375 --> 22:00.000
They got Daryl's dad's car!

22:00.167 --> 22:02.042
[Jed] Look at the size of that tank.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.792
[Matt] Jesus!

22:08.292 --> 22:11.917
Lewis. Lewis. How you doing?

22:15.708 --> 22:17.083
[Robert] Was he scared of us?

22:25.583 --> 22:27.417
[Engine rumbling]

22:35.875 --> 22:38.042
Hey, let's ask Alicia. She'll know.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.625
Six toothbrushes, please.

22:54.042 --> 22:56.583
- Oh! Oh, jed!
- Hi. How's your sister?

22:56.750 --> 22:58.125
Wha... where did you come from?

22:58.292 --> 22:59.518
The mountains. We've been hiding...

22:59.542 --> 23:01.708
Are you crazy? You gotta get outta here.

23:01.875 --> 23:04.542
We will, but first, we gotta
find out what's going...

23:10.042 --> 23:11.042
You don't understand.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.375
They know who all of you are.
They're looking for you.

23:13.542 --> 23:15.542
- Who?
- The kgb!

23:15.708 --> 23:17.875
- The Russians?
- And the Cubans!

23:18.042 --> 23:19.042
Cubans.

23:21.125 --> 23:24.417
Look, have you seen my father?
I called, there was no answer.

23:24.583 --> 23:26.083
I went by the station, it was empty.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.292
Okay, listen.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.601
I'm gonna tell you something
I'm not supposed to talk about.

23:32.625 --> 23:33.958
Nobody is, but...

23:34.125 --> 23:35.167
But what?

23:36.208 --> 23:37.792
But they took a lot of people away.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.184
People that they thought were
gonna make trouble for them.

23:40.208 --> 23:41.958
People that had guns
or things they wanted.

23:42.125 --> 23:43.125
They just took them away.

23:43.292 --> 23:44.292
Where?

23:44.958 --> 23:47.083
Re-education camps,
that's what they call it.

23:48.042 --> 23:50.122
The drive-in.
I heard they took a lot of people to...

23:52.958 --> 23:54.542
I pray for you.

23:56.292 --> 23:58.250
[Man over pa] America is a whorehouse,

23:58.458 --> 24:01.375
where the revolutionary ideals
of your forefathers

24:01.542 --> 24:06.000
are corrupted and sold in alleys
by vendors of capitalism.

24:06.167 --> 24:09.875
You grow fat on the flesh
of freedom fighters...

24:10.042 --> 24:12.625

I know right where he is.

24:46.500 --> 24:50.500
Hey! Do you know Morris' market,
out on the highway?

24:50.667 --> 24:52.583
Can you see
if Mr. Morris is in there, too?

24:52.750 --> 24:54.708
I'll look around for him, too, son.

[Matt] Daddy?

25:32.792 --> 25:36.625
Don't talk, don't say anything.
Let me look at you.

25:37.958 --> 25:39.917
Yeah. I knew I was right.

25:41.292 --> 25:42.417
I knew it.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.167
You're alive.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.625
I was tough on both of you.

25:48.917 --> 25:50.833
I did things that made you...

25:52.833 --> 25:54.542
That made you hate me sometimes.

25:56.167 --> 25:57.875
But you understand now, don't you?

25:59.958 --> 26:01.375
What happened, dad?

26:01.917 --> 26:03.317
Why are you here? What did they do?

26:04.542 --> 26:05.708
Doesn't matter.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.875
One way or another...

26:11.625 --> 26:13.875
For one reason or another, we're all gone.

Remember...

26:22.917 --> 26:25.167
Remember when you used
to go in the park and play?

26:27.583 --> 26:29.333
And I used to put you on the swings?

26:30.500 --> 26:31.625
And both of you were...

26:33.792 --> 26:35.667
So damn little, god...

26:40.875 --> 26:43.625
I remember. I remember all of it.

26:44.833 --> 26:47.309
Well, I ain't gonna be around to
pick you up when you fall now.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.333
Both of you gotta
take care of each other now.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.125
We'll never see you again, dad.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.500
Yes, you will.
I don't wanna hear that, Matty.

26:57.667 --> 27:00.500
What happened to mom, dad? Where is she?

27:11.125 --> 27:12.833
We can't afford to be crying anymore now.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.792
I don't want either one of you
to ever cry for me again.

27:19.625 --> 27:20.750
Don't ever do it.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.125
Not as long as you live.

of world war III.

29:38.708 --> 29:41.292
What are you boys doing
fooling around town, anyway?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.875
We've been looking for news, Mr. Mason.

29:44.042 --> 29:47.542
We haven't even seen or talked
to anybody since it all started.

I know my son, colonel.

41:45.583 --> 41:47.000
He's not the guerrilla type.

41:47.833 --> 41:49.750

41:49.917 --> 41:53.750
your son is a prominent student leader.

41:53.917 --> 41:55.708
Ah. Yes, well, he is a leader,

41:58.333 --> 41:59.750
No, you see, Daryl...

42:13.125 --> 42:14.583
Now, look, colonel, if he's alive,

42:14.750 --> 42:15.875
he's scared, he's hungry,

42:16.042 --> 42:18.333

with selective nuke strikes,

anymore, and we won't, either.

All that hate's gonna burn you up, kid.

01:00:50.875 --> 01:00:52.000
It keeps me warm.

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:02.625
Colonel?

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:06.333
Are we doing right?

01:01:56.292 --> 01:01:57.667
You made a new friend.

01:01:58.208 --> 01:01:59.417
[Chuckles]

01:02:03.042 --> 01:02:04.583
She doesn't say much, does she?

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.708
Something happened to her.

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.917
All right. Plane, plane, plane, plane.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.625
Cuban bunker, Russian bunker,
munitions dump, troop tents.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.708

here, here, and here.

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:44.042
Back here by the drive-in screen
are your political prisoners.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.542
All right. We'll cause
a diversion over here,

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:48.167
cut holes in the wire here,

01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:50.708
fire on all these machine-gun positions.

01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:54.583
The b group comes across
this area in a flanking maneuver

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.083
and when you reach this bunker,

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:58.792
you lay down grazing fire
on this defilade.

01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:01.250
I think that's pretty simple.

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:04.042
Anybody got any questions so far?

01:03:05.125 --> 01:03:06.125
What's a flank?

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:10.542

[Robert] Come on, here's your chance!
Move! We're running out of time!

01:04:10.917 --> 01:04:13.042

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.083
Great play, by Matt eckert!

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.875

[Robert]
All right, you cover Matt this play.

01:05:57.708 --> 01:05:58.958
Are you okay?

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.042
A little harder down
on the ground, isn't it?

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:07.833
- Yeah!
- Come on, old man. Come on.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.042

- [Erica] What's she like?
- [Andy] Old, like me.

01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:27.917
[Erica] I mean, what's she really like?

01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:32.417
Feisty. Like you.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.417
[Erica laughs]

01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:38.167
Where'd you meet her?

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:40.148
Do you really wanna know this stuff?

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:44.958
I met her in a closet at a party.

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:49.875
I couldn't stand her at first, but...
Once it took...

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.250
I loved her so bad, it hurt.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.958

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.780
I told you to do a post pattern.

01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:13.917
They brought their kids.

01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:16.685
Said they didn't have food enough
to feed 'em through the winter.

01:07:17.917 --> 01:07:19.500
They want to give 'em to you, jed.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:23.125
This is enough, Mr. Mason.
I don't want any more.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.125
You're a leader now.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.208
They've heard of you on the other side.

01:07:29.042 --> 01:07:30.958
Maybe all the way to California.

01:07:32.542 --> 01:07:34.083
And there's some that say

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:37.500
they're gonna drop in some special forces
in the spring to help you out.

01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:41.417
Green berets.

01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:49.125
Spring's a long time away.

01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:52.917
It's a lot of talk until then.

01:47:19.167 --> 01:47:20.292
[Coughs]

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:30.833
[Soldiers speaking Spanish in distance]

01:47:57.542 --> 01:47:59.292
[In Spanish] God bless.

01:48:14.667 --> 01:48:16.083
You can rest now.

01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:21.750
Just hang on, Matty.

01:48:23.917 --> 01:48:26.542
[Panting]

01:48:26.958 --> 01:48:28.875
Oh, Matty. It's okay, Matty.

01:48:29.042 --> 01:48:31.542
It's okay. Just hang on, Matty.

01:48:31.708 --> 01:48:33.417
Daddy'll be here soon, Matty.

01:48:34.542 --> 01:48:36.042
Hang on, Matty.

01:48:38.792 --> 01:48:41.708
Come on, Matty. Daddy'll be here soon.

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.167
[Grunting]

01:48:51.375 --> 01:48:53.458
It's okay. Come on, Matty.

01:49:02.042 --> 01:49:04.250
I'll hold you as long as I can, Matty.

01:49:04.417 --> 01:49:06.208
I'll hold you as long as I can.

01:49:06.375 --> 01:49:07.958
You can lean on me.

01:49:12.125 --> 01:49:13.917
I'm so tired.

01:49:17.708 --> 01:49:19.083
So tired.

01:50:00.167 --> 01:50:01.458
[Danny] We're free now.

01:50:03.208 --> 01:50:04.542
Free.

01:50:18.625 --> 01:50:20.458
[Erica] I never saw the brothers again.

01:50:21.125 --> 01:50:24.375
In time, this war,
like every other war, ended.

01:50:25.333 --> 01:50:26.958
But I never forgot.

01:50:27.125 --> 01:50:31.458
And I come to this place often,
though no one else does.

01:50:33.208 --> 01:50:36.000
"In the early days of world war III,

01:50:36.167 --> 01:50:38.500
guerrillas, mostly children,

01:50:39.333 --> 01:50:41.958
placed the names of their lost
upon this rock.

01:50:42.708 --> 01:50:44.375
They fought here alone

01:50:44.542 --> 01:50:46.250
and gave up their lives...

01:50:46.958 --> 01:50:50.625
'So that this nation shall not
perish from the earth."'
