10:39.014 --> 10:41.098
I ran them down. They're civilians.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.892
Clean. No ties to Gorowski.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.560
Let's get to it.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.980
W-What if they hired a sniper?

10:47.981 --> 10:51.401
One of us would find out
when the other one's head explodes.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.913
Empty. What the hell?

11:03.914 --> 11:05.374
It was a misdirect.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.879
Gorowski's car was blocking
that trash can when he pulled out.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.051
[Reacher] Wait.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.970
Wait. Wait, wait.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.185
Real drop happened in the newspaper.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.728
So we're staring at a garbage can

11:27.729 --> 11:29.815
while the documents are
being picked up 30 yards away.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.776
I never should've assumed
it was the envelope.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.028
In an investigation, assumptions kill.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.072
- Good rule.
- It's Garber's.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.783
I fubar'd this whole operation.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.326
Don't worry about what went wrong.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.954
Focus on putting it right.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.831
Another Garber rule?

11:46.832 --> 11:48.999
That one's mine.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.626
Okay.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.795
I think we need to haul in Gorowski.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.880
But we have nothing.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.842
He doesn't know that.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.596
[over speaker] <i>What's your plan here,
exactly, Roland?</i>

12:04.766 --> 12:06.142
<i>Think you'll plead the fifth,</i>

12:06.143 --> 12:08.228
<i>retain counsel
and then things will work out?</i>

12:10.730 --> 12:11.897
Let me be clear.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.901
There isn't a chance in hell
you are gonna lawyer your way out of this.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.489
We picked up your friend.

12:20.490 --> 12:24.201
<i>Got him with the blueprints red-handed.
Want to know the first thing he did?</i>

12:24.202 --> 12:26.203
Smart.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.706
He ratted you out.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.833
We know all about your arrangement.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.918
We know that you are
selling out your country.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.879
We know that you approached him
with an opportunity.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.755
No! No.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.799
He came after me.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.469
<i>- He came to me.</i>
- [Kohl] <i>Bullshit.</i>

12:41.470 --> 12:43.929
Why would he think
for a second that a patriotic,

12:43.930 --> 12:46.056
decorated soldier
would betray his country?

12:46.057 --> 12:48.058
No one would ever approach you
with an offer like that.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.227
Because it wasn't an offer.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.396
- It was a demand.
- A demand?

12:52.397 --> 12:53.814
You could've said no.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.774
No, I couldn't! You don't get it.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.486
He's a psychopath.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.032
He's scared.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.951
Give him time.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.171
That's it.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.341
Let him sit in his fear for a while.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.140
Little longer.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.894
What are you afraid of?

13:31.895 --> 13:33.020
Attagirl.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.230
[Gorowski] <i>I can't tell you.</i>

13:34.231 --> 13:35.523
What can't you tell me?

13:35.524 --> 13:36.649
Anything.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.652
- He's dangerous.
- How?

13:40.987 --> 13:43.323
How is he dangerous?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.536
This is the moment, Roland.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.746
Everyone eventually has it.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.082
The moment in your life
where you either do what's right,

13:53.083 --> 13:56.085
or you fuck up so bad
it's not only you who pays the price.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.379
<i>You go away for treason.</i>

13:58.380 --> 14:00.714
You get hanged for treason.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.633
Your wife, your child,

14:02.634 --> 14:04.426
will be dealing with that
long after you're gone.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.221
He took my daughter!

14:07.681 --> 14:10.015
[breathes deeply]

14:10.016 --> 14:11.392
[breathing shakily]

14:11.393 --> 14:14.395
She's four years old.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.689
And he took her.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.025
What do you mean, "took her"?

14:22.362 --> 14:25.030
He lured her
off the preschool playground.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.825
I wasn't even late picking her up.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.286
She just wasn't there.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.913
The teacher's aide said
that her uncle picked her up.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.456
She doesn't have an uncle.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.583
What happened next?

14:35.584 --> 14:36.959
My phone rang.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.878
They were watching me from somewhere.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.881
They told me to smile and to tell
the teacher everything was okay.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.301
I did.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.388
They held her

14:49.389 --> 14:51.015
overnight

14:51.016 --> 14:53.101
just to prove that they could.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.940
She was terrified.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.580
Well played, Kohl.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.043
[sniffles]

15:19.586 --> 15:21.795
I had to do what they said,

15:21.796 --> 15:24.006
or the things they said
they would do to her,

15:24.007 --> 15:25.841
I... [exhales]

15:25.842 --> 15:28.677
I've never been paid a penny.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.430
Never been given a thing.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.016
Just a weak assurance that my family

15:34.017 --> 15:36.977
would be left alone
as long as I did what they say.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.063
Did what who said?

15:39.064 --> 15:41.523
- I need a name.
- No.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.652
You don't know who you're dealing with.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.738
I am not saying any more.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.157
I can't.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.118
[Kohl] <i>Let me tell you
how people like this work.</i>

15:53.119 --> 15:54.953
<i>You give them what they want,</i>

15:54.954 --> 15:57.581
and they own you,
because now they know your weakness.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.000
So why would they ever
let you off the hook?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.960
They'll keep demanding
state secrets from you,

16:01.961 --> 16:03.671
and you will keep serving them up.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.005
A vicious cycle.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.591
And they're the types
who don't like any loose ends.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.927
So once they don't need you anymore,

16:09.928 --> 16:12.012
they will get rid of the only connection

16:12.013 --> 16:13.889
between the security leak and them.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.101
And that's you.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.270
So either you die,

16:20.271 --> 16:22.231
or your family dies

16:22.232 --> 16:24.108
or you all die.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.276
But there's no way you're not paying

16:26.277 --> 16:27.778
full admission on this thing.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.530
Your only way out is us.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.282
I need a name.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.791
Quinn.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.501
Full name.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.670
[sighs]

16:44.671 --> 16:46.840
Full name.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.342
Xavier Quinn.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.553
He's military intelligence.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.680
<i>That's why I couldn't go to the cops.</i>

16:54.681 --> 16:56.682
He's plugged in.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.767
Anything I say to them
would get back to the military

16:58.768 --> 17:00.519
and eventually him.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.522
Quinn has the system wired.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.691
You so much as put in that report
that you picked me up,

17:05.692 --> 17:07.402
he'll know within the day.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.946
Now you have to help me.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.115
Xavier Quinn

17:13.116 --> 17:15.535
is an evil man.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.293
Seems Quinn's modus operandi
hasn't changed.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.336
Still has a thing
for kidnapping and coercion.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.505
He sticks with what works for him.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.466
So how'd you play it?

17:30.467 --> 17:32.926
We tread carefully and dove deep.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.471
Found out all we could on Xavier Quinn.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.765
[Kohl] Military Intelligence Corp.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.185
Middle East Specialist.
Afghanistan Campaign Medal.

17:41.186 --> 17:44.980
Father was a railroad worker,
mother a homemaker.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.983
He somehow stashed away half a mil
in an account I found in Aruba.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.777
Rents a big house in McLean.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.028
Boat. Jaguar.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.655
I spoke with someone in Imagery Analysis.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.824
She's crossed paths with Quinn
a few times.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.076
Says he keeps to himself, pretty vanilla.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.412
Spends weekends
up at a farmhouse in Linton.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.373
What kind of career military man
can afford those kind of assets?

18:03.374 --> 18:05.793
The kind who has
a side gig selling state secrets.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.378
[knocking at door]

18:08.671 --> 18:09.755
At ease, Private.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.006
Come in.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.674
The phone records you requested.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.092
Those Quinn's?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.385
Affirmative.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.554
I already reviewed his LUDs.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.808
I saw multiple calls to the same person
over several months.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.851
The calls were to...

18:22.852 --> 18:25.938
It's, uh, it's toward the end, page 12.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.482
I highlighted them for you.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.859
Safwan Qasim.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.653
I did a preliminary run on the name.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.738
He's a Syrian national with military ties,

18:34.739 --> 18:37.533
whose cover job is a senior
research fellow at a think tank.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.077
This has got to be the guy
that Quinn is selling secrets to.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.578
Great job, Tony.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.163
Sure. [chuckles]

18:43.164 --> 18:44.457
My pleasure.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.125
Now that we know this,

18:47.126 --> 18:48.836
what's the next step?

18:48.837 --> 18:51.255
- You tell me.
- We pay a visit to Safwan.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.341
[loud dance music playing]

19:02.559 --> 19:03.934
[Kohl] It's not our guy.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.435
Damn it.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.146
I know you're itching to take him down,
but you can't forget

19:08.147 --> 19:10.315
Safwan's a government agent,
so his security detail

19:10.316 --> 19:12.401
will be former paramilitary.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.611
We neutralize, but don't kill.

19:14.612 --> 19:18.073
Dead foreigners lead to investigations,
and Quinn could find out and abort.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.701
Also Safwan can't sustain
any visible injuries

19:20.702 --> 19:23.538
or Quinn'll get suspicious.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.542
- Copy that.
- Copy.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.085
[Frasconi] Can't be much longer.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.670
Club's gonna close soon.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.338
I wouldn't last five minutes in there.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.048
[chuckles] Don't like crowds?

19:35.049 --> 19:36.758
Music's terrible.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.343
If you can call it music.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.636
[Frasconi] Eh, I don't mind it.

19:39.637 --> 19:40.888
I like dancing.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.056
Anytime, anywhere.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.018
Anyone ever want to go dancing, I'm in.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.316
You dance, Kohl?

19:53.443 --> 19:54.526
[Kohl] There he is.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.571
Let's go.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.367
[Reacher] Mr. Qasim!

20:02.619 --> 20:04.661
Possibly. Who's asking?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.163
Major Jack Reacher.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.873
U.S. Military Police.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.167
We've been made aware
of your connection to unlawful trade

20:10.168 --> 20:11.793
of American military secrets.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.337
We'd like to ask you some questions.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.213
I don't think that's going to happen,

20:15.214 --> 20:16.590
Major Reacher.

20:16.591 --> 20:17.966
We're trying to do this nicely.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.928
Once again,
I don't think that's going to happen.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.054
Hey!

20:22.055 --> 20:24.348
Hey, why don't you take a step back, pal?

20:24.349 --> 20:26.016
[grunting]

20:26.017 --> 20:27.643
Don't do it!

20:27.644 --> 20:30.270
Let me guess:
hired help, paid by the hour.

20:30.271 --> 20:33.066
Couple hundred bucks a day
worth dying over?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.361
That's what I thought.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.489
Pick these morons up and get lost.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.117
Now...

20:44.118 --> 20:46.078
about those questions.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.704
[grunts]

20:47.705 --> 20:50.290
I am a foreign national
with many powerful friends.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.875
You're a foreign national who attacked

20:51.876 --> 20:54.044
American military personnel
on American soil.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.797
That makes you an enemy combatant,
which means I can disappear

20:56.798 --> 20:59.758
your ass in less than two hours,
locked up in God knows where,

20:59.759 --> 21:01.885
gone forever, like you never existed.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.554
Or we'll hold you,

21:04.555 --> 21:06.223
you'll help us bring in Xavier Quinn.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.558
And when it's over,
we'll put you on a watch list

21:08.559 --> 21:10.519
and a nice coach seat back home.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.355
Your choice.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.195
Kohl.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.613
[grunts]

21:21.614 --> 21:23.074
Let's go.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.452
Private... Look.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.329
I know you like Kohl.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.665
Like her? Like as a friend--

21:31.666 --> 21:33.709
Shut up. It's obvious.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.254
But you can't let personal feelings
affect your judgment in the field.

21:37.255 --> 21:40.132
