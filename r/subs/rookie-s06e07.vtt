I'll be there in 20.

00:04.556 --> 00:05.695
- What's going on?
- I got to go.

00:05.729 --> 00:06.834
- Just wait.
- I can't.

00:06.868 --> 00:08.353
I'll call you when I can.

00:08.387 --> 00:10.562
- What the hell are you into
that's making you so crazy?

00:10.596 --> 00:12.081
- I can't tell you.
- Why?

00:12.115 --> 00:13.254
- Because even knowing
about it will put you

00:13.289 --> 00:14.428
at risk with the department.

00:14.462 --> 00:16.326
- I have a group
of friends at school,

00:16.361 --> 00:17.845
and they're getting
a place together.

00:17.879 --> 00:20.020
And I was thinking
of joining them.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.607

- Kinda.

00:21.642 --> 00:23.057

roped in two other officers?

I'm required to notify
your Metro commander.

00:28.476 --> 00:30.168
What she does with it
is up to her.

00:30.202 --> 00:33.619
- Lucy, I've been lying
to myself for a long time.

00:33.654 --> 00:36.381
I can't just go back
to the way things were.

00:36.415 --> 00:37.727
- Are you breaking up with me?

00:37.761 --> 00:38.935
- I'm sorry.

00:38.969 --> 00:40.109
- What's happening?

00:40.143 --> 00:41.765
- I think we
should have a baby.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.595
- I haven't even had
a cup of coffee yet.

00:43.629 --> 00:46.115
Maybe we table this
till later?

00:46.149 --> 00:49.083
Having a kid has been
the greatest joy in my life,

00:49.118 --> 00:51.465
so why would I want
to deny her that?

00:51.499 --> 00:53.846
[tense music]

00:55.296 --> 00:57.126
- It's all about temperature.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.818
That is the best indicator
about whether or not

00:59.852 --> 01:03.304
I'm ovulating--
that and cervical mucus.

01:03.339 --> 01:05.962
- I did not know that.

01:05.996 --> 01:10.449
Thank you for that tidbit
and for the ride.

01:10.484 --> 01:12.795
- Hey, time is not on our side.

01:12.831 --> 01:15.282
We need to get serious
about maximizing our chances.

01:15.316 --> 01:16.317
- Oh, agreed. Yeah.

01:16.352 --> 01:18.078
You let me know when the--

01:18.112 --> 01:19.664
- Cervical mucus.

01:27.156 --> 01:29.640
I was hoping we could stop at
Revolution after roll call.

01:29.675 --> 01:30.849
- Oh, we still can.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.126
I'm gonna need four
more shots, minimum.

01:32.161 --> 01:33.300
- Ooh, bad night of sleep?

01:33.334 --> 01:35.164
- No, just still
trying to get pregnant.

01:35.198 --> 01:36.613
- Oh, poor you.

01:36.648 --> 01:38.132
Constant sex with
your gorgeous wife?

01:38.167 --> 01:39.823
You should take a day
off to take a break.

01:39.858 --> 01:41.308
- OK.
Fair enough.

01:41.342 --> 01:42.688
But turns out, it's
not quite as much fun

01:42.723 --> 01:45.312
when she has you on
a tight schedule.

01:45.346 --> 01:46.622

Speaking of, I got to go.

01:59.533 --> 02:00.982

02:01.017 --> 02:03.123

6:00 and midnight?

Hello, Mom.
Are you free today?

02:24.765 --> 02:27.319
Because I just fired my nanny.

02:27.353 --> 02:29.494
- How did I end up
with so much stuff?

02:29.528 --> 02:31.461
I used to live
out of a backpack.

02:31.496 --> 02:32.807
- Hey, listen.

02:32.841 --> 02:34.533
If you are overwhelmed,
you could always delay

02:34.567 --> 02:37.916
by a few days or a few weeks.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.192

been going through a lot

02:41.091 --> 02:42.472

you should stay for me.

to babysit.

03:53.785 --> 03:55.787
She's there to observe.

Listen, Sarge,

I know you're--you're
worried about me, but--

been bounced back to patrol

04:04.209 --> 04:05.486
for reckless behavior,

04:05.521 --> 04:06.832
and you broke up
with your girlfriend.

04:06.867 --> 04:10.146
Both things make me
question your judgment.

04:10.180 --> 04:11.389
- Sir, breaking up with Lucy

04:11.423 --> 04:13.011
has nothing to do
with the Ray situation.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.633
Trust me.

want to regain my trust,

04:16.841 --> 04:17.911
this is where it starts.

Now, I can make this

mandated counseling,

finding a replacement.

05:42.790 --> 05:45.483
I scheduled three nanny
interviews last week.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.761
Two of them were hired
by other families

05:47.795 --> 05:49.245
before I could even
meet with them,

05:49.279 --> 05:50.522
and then the third one flaked.

05:50.557 --> 05:52.213
- I thought you had
someone you liked.

05:52.248 --> 05:53.905
- Yeah.
She can't do full-time.

childcare in two weeks,

- I have an interview

You want in?

06:05.813 --> 06:07.608
Weeding through
applicants together

06:07.643 --> 06:10.231

Aaron along as a buffer.

06:35.774 --> 06:37.638
Classic avoidant
attachment style.

06:37.673 --> 06:38.984
- Avoidant what?

06:39.019 --> 06:40.814
- It means you prefer
surface-level relationships

06:40.848 --> 06:41.953
to deep intimacy.

06:41.987 --> 06:43.644
It's a defense mechanism
that can develop

by an overly strict

06:44.852 --> 06:46.302

to make you feel uncomfortable.
