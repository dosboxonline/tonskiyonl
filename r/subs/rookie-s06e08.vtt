WEBVTT

00:02.071 --> 00:03.037
<i>Previously on
"The Rookie"...</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:04.073
I think
we should have a baby.

00:04.073 --> 00:05.315
How do you feel
about having sex

00:05.315 --> 00:07.007
in the back of an ambulance?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.250
I'm guessing she's in some
kind of contest with herself

00:09.250 --> 00:10.907
to see how fast
she can conceive.

00:10.907 --> 00:14.048
You violated procedure and
roped in two other officers?

00:14.048 --> 00:16.982
I can't just go back
to the way things were.

00:16.982 --> 00:18.294
Are you breaking up with me?

00:18.294 --> 00:19.467
I'm sorry.

00:19.467 --> 00:20.572
I got stood up.

00:20.572 --> 00:22.160
Who the hell
would stand you up?

00:22.160 --> 00:24.334
I mean, you are a catch.

00:24.334 --> 00:26.164
Did Tim really get
kicked out of Metro?

00:26.164 --> 00:28.235
- Yeah.
- First day back on patrol.

00:28.235 --> 00:31.307
I need you to take
Dr. London on a ride-along.

00:31.307 --> 00:34.068
You asked the department
shrink to--to babysit me?

00:34.068 --> 00:35.587
I--I think you're right.

00:35.587 --> 00:37.899
<i>I am mad at myself.</i>

00:42.456 --> 00:44.492
<i>â™ª Learn to use your voice</i>

00:44.492 --> 00:46.046
Monica, you're not listening.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.702
There's no way I can
get that deal approved.

00:47.702 --> 00:49.083
Client has to do some time.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.981
She's got a rap sheet
longer than "War and Peace."

00:50.981 --> 00:52.983
Nobody reads anymore, Wesley.

00:52.983 --> 00:55.158
And her rap sheet
is irrelevant.

00:55.158 --> 00:57.505
We'll never get this deal
negotiated with that attitude.

00:57.505 --> 00:58.989
<i>Then we can go to court.
Is that you want?</i>

00:58.989 --> 01:00.957
<i>I said--</i>

01:00.957 --> 01:02.786
- Shut up.
- Excuse me?

01:04.236 --> 01:05.824
I think there's
someone in my house.

01:05.824 --> 01:07.308
The Ghost
of Christmas Future?

01:07.308 --> 01:09.448
I'm gonna check it out.
I'll call you back.

01:09.448 --> 01:10.794
<i>No, no.
Don't--don't check it out.</i>

01:10.794 --> 01:12.486
Lock yourself in your bedroom.
Call 911.

01:12.486 --> 01:15.420
I'm pretty sure you forget
who you're talking to.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.320
If you're scared, you call 911.

01:42.309 --> 01:43.896
You better run!

01:45.588 --> 01:47.590
Police are on their way!

01:47.590 --> 01:49.523
Even worse,
half the guys in lockup

01:49.523 --> 01:52.077
would scoop your eyeballs out
if I told them to.

01:52.077 --> 01:53.216
Oh!

02:04.193 --> 02:05.263
Yah!

02:23.177 --> 02:24.454
You break in
to rob the place,

02:24.454 --> 02:25.628
or did someone send you
to kill me?

02:27.630 --> 02:29.321
That's a yes
on coming to kill me.

02:33.946 --> 02:37.018
Who was it?

02:38.744 --> 02:40.608
To be continued.

02:54.346 --> 02:55.865
Help me.

03:07.048 --> 03:08.153
Hey.

03:21.684 --> 03:23.237
Bradford.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.343
Mad Dog, Dr. London.

03:26.827 --> 03:28.242
Hey, listen.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.830
We didn't get a chance
to talk about me leaving Metro.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.728
Water under the bridge, bro.

03:31.728 --> 03:33.074
See ya, Doc.

03:34.697 --> 03:35.870
Are you...

03:35.870 --> 03:37.424
No, I'm actually
heading up to five

03:37.424 --> 03:40.427
to drop off some paperwork,
just got on the wrong elevator.

03:42.601 --> 03:44.776
Everything okay with Mad Dog?

03:44.776 --> 03:47.123
Can't discuss a patient.

03:47.123 --> 03:49.988
Technically shouldn't have
told you he's a patient.

03:49.988 --> 03:52.128
How are you doing?

03:52.128 --> 03:54.855
Did seeing a former squad mate
upset you?

03:54.855 --> 03:56.788
Well, last I checked,
we're in an elevator

03:56.788 --> 03:58.445
and not your office, so...

03:58.445 --> 04:00.240
Of course. Sorry.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.345
Still internalizing
the rules of engagement.

04:05.106 --> 04:06.418
I'll see you Thursday.

04:06.418 --> 04:08.627
Yeah.
Looking forward to it.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.838
<i>How's it working out
with your new roommate?</i>

04:12.838 --> 04:14.737
Technically,
she's about to move in.

04:14.737 --> 04:15.979
But wait, why are you asking?

04:15.979 --> 04:17.567
We're thin today.

04:17.567 --> 04:20.190
Got a bunch of sick calls,
and Nolan took a personal day.

04:20.190 --> 04:21.675
So I need you
to ride with Celina.

04:21.675 --> 04:25.230
Oh, uh, but I'm--
I'm not a training officer.

04:25.230 --> 04:28.785
In the name of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

04:28.785 --> 04:31.132
I hereby--come here--

04:31.132 --> 04:35.205
appoint you as acting
training officer for the day.

04:35.205 --> 04:37.415
Is that something
you can do, sir?

04:37.415 --> 04:38.554
I'm all-powerful.

04:38.554 --> 04:40.072
Oh, okay.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.523
But is it gonna be a problem
overseeing your roommate?

04:42.523 --> 04:43.835
No, sir.

04:43.835 --> 04:45.526
Officer Juarez and I
are both professionals.

04:45.526 --> 04:47.045
Good answer.

04:51.498 --> 04:52.706
Sorry, I--I can come back.

04:52.706 --> 04:53.879
No, no, no, no.

04:53.879 --> 04:56.296
Officer Chen needs to go
round up her boot.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.194
Boot? Really?

04:58.194 --> 05:00.058
Give her the all-powerful gag?

05:00.058 --> 05:01.922
Yeah. Have a good shift.

05:01.922 --> 05:03.233
Yeah, you too.

05:05.374 --> 05:06.444
Wow.

05:06.444 --> 05:08.791
That wasn't awkward at all.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.931
Believe it or not, it's--
it's better than it's been.

05:10.931 --> 05:12.415
Well, you need to fix it.

05:12.415 --> 05:15.453
Dysfunction kills
team efficiency.

05:15.453 --> 05:16.971
And I'm not going out
like that.

05:16.971 --> 05:18.248
So you need to work it out.

05:18.248 --> 05:21.424
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to choose who stays

05:21.424 --> 05:24.047
and who transfers
to North Hollywood.

05:24.047 --> 05:27.741
And trust me, it won't be
Officer Chen who goes.

05:27.741 --> 05:28.845
Understood.

05:28.845 --> 05:30.364
In the meantime,
I've got another

05:30.364 --> 05:32.159
fun assignment for you--

05:32.159 --> 05:34.437
helping your old Metro team.

05:34.437 --> 05:36.819
They're looking for someone
who knows pre-raid surveillance

05:36.819 --> 05:38.579
and dynamic entry SOPs.

05:38.579 --> 05:39.856
Great.
I'd be happy to lead the team.

05:39.856 --> 05:40.892
You know the target?

05:40.892 --> 05:42.618
Barrio Rosa.

05:42.618 --> 05:45.379
But, um, you're not
leading anything.

05:45.379 --> 05:49.279
They want you on point to keep
watch on their clubhouse,

05:49.279 --> 05:50.384
i.e. the target.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.386
Sure.
Yeah, babysitting the scene

05:52.386 --> 05:54.319
before the op kicks off--

05:54.319 --> 05:56.563
quarterback to water boy.

05:56.563 --> 05:58.116
Sure, yeah, whatever you need.

05:58.116 --> 06:00.360
Great.
Um...

06:00.360 --> 06:01.982
take Thorsen.

06:01.982 --> 06:05.192
He can use improvement
on special ops knowledge.

06:05.192 --> 06:06.469
Yes, sir.

06:08.229 --> 06:09.196
<i>Hi.</i>

06:09.196 --> 06:10.922
We're here to see Dr. Bhatia.

06:12.268 --> 06:14.304
You know, when I say
"fertility doctor,"

06:14.304 --> 06:17.411
it sounds so weirdly
18th century, right?

06:17.411 --> 06:20.656
Like he's gonna prescribe
a cocaine and morphine tincture

06:20.656 --> 06:22.416
for my consumption.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.384
Pretty sure you wouldn't
see a fertility doctor

06:24.384 --> 06:26.765
for consumption,
even in the 1800s.

06:26.765 --> 06:29.837
Oh, well, yes,
if we're gonna split hairs.

06:31.045 --> 06:33.634
Oh, hey,
what are you doing here?

06:33.634 --> 06:35.498
Monica got attacked
in her home.

06:35.498 --> 06:36.741
She shot the intruder.

06:36.741 --> 06:38.398
Disgruntled client?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.502
No idea.

06:39.502 --> 06:41.124
Paramedics are
bringing them both in.

06:42.298 --> 06:43.437
Ow!

06:43.437 --> 06:45.232
Could you make the ride
any rougher?

06:45.232 --> 06:46.682
I have a head injury.

06:47.821 --> 06:48.960
Wait, are you guys okay?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.133
Yeah, no,
just a doctor appointment.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.411
Go--go do your thing.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.310
I'll let's start with patrol.

06:57.658 --> 06:58.797
You okay?

06:58.797 --> 07:01.213
No.
I'm supposed to be in court.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.801
- He say anything?
- No, ma'am.

07:02.801 --> 07:04.113
And no ID on him.

07:04.113 --> 07:05.494
- Keys?
- No.

07:05.494 --> 07:07.150
Well, he didn't just walk
into that neighborhood.

07:07.150 --> 07:08.773
He must have stashed
the keys somewhere.

07:08.773 --> 07:10.568
Call in for a canvass.
Run every license plate

07:10.568 --> 07:12.604
in a half-mile radius
if you have to.

07:12.604 --> 07:13.881
What's her story?

07:13.881 --> 07:16.505
She's almost as tight-lipped
as our guy here.

07:16.505 --> 07:18.852
Said he broke in,
assaulted her.

07:18.852 --> 07:20.025
She got a couple of shots off.

07:20.025 --> 07:22.027
And then we went
down the stairs.

07:22.027 --> 07:24.892
And you managed to shoot him
in both feet before the tumble?

07:24.892 --> 07:26.687
That's what I said.

07:26.687 --> 07:28.206
Do I need to talk slower?

07:28.206 --> 07:30.795
No.
It's just that TID told me

07:30.795 --> 07:32.762
that they found
one shell casing upstairs

07:32.762 --> 07:34.937
and the other one
down in the foyer.

07:34.937 --> 07:36.248
You ask her about
the shell casings?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.250
- Doing it now.
- Look, it's not my job

07:38.250 --> 07:40.425
to teach you the physics
of shell casing ejections

07:40.425 --> 07:42.289
during a violent struggle.

07:42.289 --> 07:45.188
And if your intention is to try
and take this opportunity

07:45.188 --> 07:48.571
to paint me as the bad guy
in my own assault,

07:48.571 --> 07:50.400
then I'll see you both
in court.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.541
Slow your roll, Red.
We're just doing our job.

07:52.541 --> 07:55.198
Well, go do it somewhere else
so the doctor can examine me

07:55.198 --> 07:56.959
and stitch up my head.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.444
No problem.
We will talk later.

08:01.101 --> 08:04.276
- You think she's lying?
- With every breath she takes.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.180
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.354
Is today gonna be
uncomfortable for you at all?

08:13.354 --> 08:14.355
Oh, no, not at all.

08:14.355 --> 08:15.633
Because on the face of it,

08:15.633 --> 08:18.808
I realize that me being
your boss for the day

08:18.808 --> 08:22.847
on the eve of you moving in
could prove to be challenging.

08:22.847 --> 08:25.470
My point of view is that
you have a wealth of knowledge

08:25.470 --> 08:28.266
that I'm excited
to spend the day absorbing.

08:28.266 --> 08:29.923
Great. Okay.

08:29.923 --> 08:32.028
Well, listen, I'm not gonna be
trying to trip you up

08:32.028 --> 08:33.409
or make you jump
through any hoops.

08:33.409 --> 08:35.791
I don't see why today
can't be about, you know,

08:35.791 --> 08:37.171
investing in your success.

08:37.171 --> 08:38.828
- Sounds good to me.
- Great.

08:38.828 --> 08:41.382
Yeah, okay, let's get it.

08:41.382 --> 08:42.522
Nice.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.040
Something always goes wrong.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.801
All the tactical preparation
in the world

08:45.801 --> 08:47.768
becomes moot the second
boots hit the ground.

08:47.768 --> 08:48.942
Yeah, everybody's got a plan

08:48.942 --> 08:50.184
till they get punched
in the face.

08:50.184 --> 08:51.358
Exactly.

08:51.358 --> 08:52.635
The best team leaders
understand that

08:52.635 --> 08:53.981
and can pivot in a heartbeat.

08:53.981 --> 08:55.224
Got it.

08:55.224 --> 08:58.468
Tell me why I have to be
in full uniform again?

08:58.468 --> 09:00.540
In case we take
enforcement action,

09:00.540 --> 09:02.403
uniform verifies
we're the police.

09:02.403 --> 09:04.509
Got it.

09:04.509 --> 09:07.995
And I have to be the one
to wear it because...

09:09.479 --> 09:11.171
Tell me more
about our target.

09:13.622 --> 09:16.417
Barrio Rosa is
a Mexican mafia offshoot,

09:16.417 --> 09:18.419
heavy into Special K and meth.

09:18.419 --> 09:21.906
CI told Metro, that warehouse
is a base of operations.

09:21.906 --> 09:24.702
Okay.
Surveillance note-taking 101.

09:24.702 --> 09:27.152
Because Metro is about to hit
that warehouse in a few hours,

09:27.152 --> 09:29.258
we have to write down
everything that happens.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.674
Start writing this.

09:31.674 --> 09:33.642
"Sergeant Bradford,
Officer Thorsen

09:33.642 --> 09:35.609
land at 0914 hours."

09:35.609 --> 09:37.749
"0914 hours."

09:37.749 --> 09:38.785
Can I ask you a question?

09:38.785 --> 09:40.096
No.

09:40.096 --> 09:42.616
Mail carrier...

09:42.616 --> 09:45.239
number 11-46,

09:45.239 --> 09:50.175
uh, arrives on target
at 0916 hours,

09:50.175 --> 09:52.799
makes delivery,
and moves on.

09:54.248 --> 09:57.044
And the answer
to your question is no.

09:57.044 --> 09:58.528
I mean, you don't even know
what the question is.

09:58.528 --> 09:59.840
Of course I do.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.290
You want to know
if it bothers me

10:01.290 --> 10:03.188
that I'm here doing grunt work
while my former squad's

10:03.188 --> 10:05.708
about to take down
a major drug trafficker.

10:05.708 --> 10:06.813
I mean, it has to, right?

10:06.813 --> 10:08.262
Wrong.

10:08.262 --> 10:09.643
My job is to do
what's asked of me

10:09.643 --> 10:11.680
to the best of my abilities
without complaint.

10:13.129 --> 10:16.443
Although I would recommend you
switch to a stronger deodorant.

10:20.827 --> 10:25.176
Male transient pushing
a shopping cart past target

10:25.176 --> 10:30.457
at 0917 hours and moves on.

10:32.597 --> 10:33.943
Why aren't you writing?

10:36.083 --> 10:37.947
I was checking my deodorant.

10:44.782 --> 10:47.439
I'm just saying, it feels
like they're showing off.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.719
So to your thinking,

10:50.719 --> 10:53.514
these ladies don't actually
have appointments.

10:53.514 --> 10:54.861
They're just hanging out
in a waiting room

10:54.861 --> 10:56.586
to make you feel inadequate?

10:56.586 --> 10:59.382
Well, when you put it
that way, I sound crazy.

10:59.382 --> 11:00.763
But yes.

11:00.763 --> 11:02.627
We don't even know
that there's a problem.

11:02.627 --> 11:04.456
I just--
I feel it in my bones.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.734
- Bailey.
- Hi.

11:05.734 --> 11:07.494
- Hey.
- I heard you were here.

11:07.494 --> 11:08.771
Thought I'd come check on you.

11:08.771 --> 11:10.117
That's so sweet.
Thank you.

11:10.117 --> 11:12.257
Nonsense.
Doctor Bhatia is awesome.

11:12.257 --> 11:15.433
She has helped hundreds of
patients with fertility issues,

11:15.433 --> 11:17.400
not that we know
that you have any.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.126
Right.

11:20.714 --> 11:21.819
What's going on?

11:21.819 --> 11:23.786
- I don't know.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.098
<i>All available
medical personnel</i>

11:25.098 --> 11:26.789
<i>to the ER for Code Yellow.</i>

11:26.789 --> 11:28.273
I'm sorry, I have to go.

11:28.273 --> 11:30.241
Right.
Do you think we should help?

11:30.241 --> 11:31.621
I do.
They might need us.

11:31.621 --> 11:32.933
Let's go.

11:37.524 --> 11:38.905
Bailey Nune?

11:42.529 --> 11:44.324
Bailey Nune?

11:49.639 --> 11:51.331
Hey, hey, break it up.

11:58.062 --> 12:00.650
We need to clear everyone out
for incoming patients.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.238
My suspect's waiting
for surgery.

12:02.238 --> 12:03.584
Okay, we'll move him
into the hallway.

12:03.584 --> 12:05.759
He can stand outside the OR.
You can go with him.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.281
I cleared your paperwork,
so you can go home.

12:12.179 --> 12:13.871
Um, you know,

12:13.871 --> 12:17.012
I started feeling really dizzy
a few minutes ago.

12:17.012 --> 12:18.323
Okay, we'll get you admitted.

12:18.323 --> 12:20.153
I don't want you going home
with a concussion.

12:20.153 --> 12:21.879
But in the meantime,
we're gonna need to put you

12:21.879 --> 12:23.639
in the hallway
while we wait for a room.

12:23.639 --> 12:25.020
I'm sorry
for the inconvenience.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.815
Not at all.
I understand.

12:30.715 --> 12:32.096
What happened?

12:32.096 --> 12:34.512
Eastern Front and Russian mob
threw down in a big way.

12:34.512 --> 12:36.548
The Eastern Front boss
got shot in the chest.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.722
I'm not sure how it kicked off,

12:37.722 --> 12:40.138
but we got north
of 30 casualties inbound.

12:40.138 --> 12:41.622
From both sides?

12:41.622 --> 12:43.314
You couldn't separate the gangs
to different hospitals?

12:43.314 --> 12:45.799
I left my sorting hat
at the station.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.594
I have additional units coming

12:47.594 --> 12:49.699
from Rampart and Hollywood
to assist.

12:49.699 --> 12:51.667
But if boss man dies,

12:51.667 --> 12:53.048
all hell is gonna break loose.

13:01.228 --> 13:03.092
Hey, uh, where should
we put this guy?

13:03.092 --> 13:04.231
He's Russian?

13:06.095 --> 13:08.304
Eastern Front.

13:08.304 --> 13:09.650
To the left.

13:11.998 --> 13:13.827
Let's set him down
right here by this one.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.728
All right, the doctor's
are gonna check you out.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.696
Then we'll get you down
to Mid-Wilshire for processing.

13:20.696 --> 13:24.527
So just, uh, sit tight
and don't cause any trouble.

13:25.977 --> 13:28.221
Uh, one thing, when you--

13:28.221 --> 13:30.775
when you're letting the cuffed
wrist switch up, use the hold.

13:30.775 --> 13:31.845
Oh, I didn't even think
about that.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.467
- Yeah, yeah.
- Got a guy here.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.193
Not sure if he's gang
or citizen...

13:35.193 --> 13:36.919
Because I don't speak Russian.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.025
No, Smitty, please, no!

13:44.202 --> 13:46.377
Hands. Great.

13:46.377 --> 13:48.551
Thanks for the assist.
I thought you had the day off.

13:48.551 --> 13:50.243
I do.
Had a doctor's appointment.

13:50.243 --> 13:51.416
Thank you.

13:51.416 --> 13:54.316
Oh, jeez.
Okay, come on.

13:54.316 --> 13:56.214
Are you okay?
- I'm great.

13:56.214 --> 13:59.286
Just completed my
"wounded in the line of duty"

13:59.286 --> 14:00.736
punch card.

14:02.427 --> 14:04.636
Pension will be firing
on all cylinders now.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.983
Okay, well,
I'm happy for you.

14:05.983 --> 14:06.984
- Whew!
- All right.

14:06.984 --> 14:08.986
I'll be right back.

14:08.986 --> 14:10.780
Well, you finish up
your appointment?

14:10.780 --> 14:12.023
Uh, no.

14:12.023 --> 14:13.369
I was going to,
but we got pulled into that.

14:13.369 --> 14:15.440
Maybe we can squeeze it in
later on today.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.786
What do you need from us?

14:16.786 --> 14:19.065
I got a stack of field
interview cards in my trunk.

14:19.065 --> 14:20.480
Grab those and start
passing them out.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.999
We need to start collecting
witness statements

14:21.999 --> 14:23.690
so we can try to make sense
of this mess.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.071
But aren't they all
gonna lie?

14:25.071 --> 14:26.693
Some of them will,
but hopefully we'll get enough

14:26.693 --> 14:28.419
of the truth to figure out
what the hell happened.

14:28.419 --> 14:29.696
Was anybody
seriously injured?

14:29.696 --> 14:31.456
A couple of Russians
got cut up pretty bad.

14:31.456 --> 14:32.837
One is critical.

14:32.837 --> 14:35.288
The leader of the
Eastern Front, Armen Azarian,

14:35.288 --> 14:37.704
just went into surgery--
shot twice in the chest.

14:37.704 --> 14:40.155
Right now we've got
a ton of mutual combat

14:40.155 --> 14:42.329
with a half dozen assault
with a deadly weapon.

14:42.329 --> 14:44.745
But if Azarian dies,
that all changes.

14:44.745 --> 14:47.024
We are looking
at a murder charge

14:47.024 --> 14:49.026
and a full-out gang war.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.031
- You get the--
- Cyclist?

14:54.031 --> 14:55.687
Yep, already noted.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.139
Damn.

14:59.139 --> 15:01.279
Thought I'd turned
this alert off.

15:01.279 --> 15:04.455
Yeah, you must have set that
a few different times.

15:04.455 --> 15:06.284
I can take a look at it
if you want.

15:06.284 --> 15:08.183
No. It's fine.

15:12.049 --> 15:14.465
Are you gonna
get her anything?

15:14.465 --> 15:16.398
Pretty sure it's bad form
to buy a present

15:16.398 --> 15:18.020
for the girl you broke up with.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.367
Or a girl you kissed
at a wedding.

15:20.367 --> 15:21.368
Never mind.

15:26.028 --> 15:28.306
Metro needs us back
at the station for a pre-brief.

15:28.306 --> 15:30.032
Relief detail arriving in five.

15:30.032 --> 15:31.137
Great.

15:31.137 --> 15:32.897
Now I can change
into a dry uniform

15:32.897 --> 15:34.795
and up my deodorant game.

15:38.385 --> 15:40.594
Did you buy her a present?

15:40.594 --> 15:41.699
Lucy?

15:41.699 --> 15:44.495
Yeah, spa day
at the Four Seasons.

15:44.495 --> 15:45.599
Celina's idea.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.774
- Nice.
- Yeah.

15:51.571 --> 15:52.710
Can I ask why y'all split up?

15:52.710 --> 15:54.160
No.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.956
You haven't heard anything?

15:56.956 --> 16:00.787
Well, have you shaken
all the trusted trees?

16:00.787 --> 16:02.513
No. No, no, stop asking.

16:02.513 --> 16:05.274
I don't want the wrong people
to hear that I'm on the hunt.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.793
I'll--I'll get back to you.

16:06.793 --> 16:08.277
Hey.

16:08.277 --> 16:09.347
How you feeling?

16:09.347 --> 16:10.762
Sore.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.421
Did you come all the way
down here just to check on me?

16:16.147 --> 16:17.355
I did.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.015
I'm touched.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.534
I thought that was you.

16:23.534 --> 16:24.535
Hey.

16:24.535 --> 16:26.295
Detective Lopez.

16:26.295 --> 16:28.263
How does it feel
to have your husband rush down

16:28.263 --> 16:29.885
to check on the former
love of his life?

16:29.885 --> 16:31.404
As the true love of his life,

16:31.404 --> 16:33.371
I feel great that
he's such a good person

16:33.371 --> 16:36.305
he can show compassion
for someone as unworthy as you.

16:37.548 --> 16:40.206
Are you ready
to finish our interview?

16:40.206 --> 16:42.139
No.

16:42.139 --> 16:44.279
Okay, but the fact
that you're not all over me

16:44.279 --> 16:45.901
to press charges
against this guy

16:45.901 --> 16:47.730
is setting off alarms
in my brain.

16:47.730 --> 16:50.699
I'll try and control
my concern.

16:50.699 --> 16:53.184
We still have a plea deal
to negotiate,

16:53.184 --> 16:54.703
and I've got some free time.

16:54.703 --> 16:56.946
Yeah, I'm not falling for that.

16:56.946 --> 16:58.741
You'll turn around and tell
the judge I took advantage

16:58.741 --> 17:00.433
while you were suffering
from a head injury.

17:00.433 --> 17:01.813
I would never.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.091
Yeah, right.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.301
I'm glad you're okay.

17:08.406 --> 17:10.063
Sorry you came down.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.685
Not at all.
I got to see you.

17:11.685 --> 17:12.928
Aw.

17:12.928 --> 17:14.412
Quickie in
the janitor's closet?

17:14.412 --> 17:15.862
Wait. Do you have time?

17:15.862 --> 17:17.243
Not at all.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.072
But a girl can fantasize.
- Aw.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.349
Hey, did you hear?

17:20.349 --> 17:21.626
Armen died on the table.

17:21.626 --> 17:22.972
Damn it.

17:22.972 --> 17:25.009
Azarian's dead,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

17:25.009 --> 17:26.528
Yeah, we should
reach out to Grey,

17:26.528 --> 17:28.599
see if he can send us
some more support,

17:28.599 --> 17:30.359
and maybe set up
some metal detectors.

17:31.498 --> 17:33.776
Hey.
Did you manage to reschedule?

17:33.776 --> 17:35.054
Yeah, they're gonna
squeeze us in

17:35.054 --> 17:36.331
in the next 30 minutes.
- Great.

17:36.331 --> 17:37.884
Did it settle down out there?

17:37.884 --> 17:39.299
Uh, yes and no.

17:39.299 --> 17:41.301
I mean, most of the combatants
have been squared away,

17:41.301 --> 17:43.338
but now their family members
are starting to arrive,

17:43.338 --> 17:46.065
most of whom are probably
also gang members.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.825
Well, if you wanna go
back out there and help,

17:47.825 --> 17:49.792
there's no reason both of us
need to sit here and wait.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.518
No, I'm not gonna
leave you now.

17:51.518 --> 17:53.175
My anxiety level is low.

17:53.175 --> 17:55.246
The magazine selection
is solid.

17:55.246 --> 17:57.076
So go make yourself useful,
and I'll text you

17:57.076 --> 17:58.560
when you need to come back.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.561
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:59.561 --> 18:00.562
You are the best.

18:00.562 --> 18:02.150
- I know.

18:15.024 --> 18:16.267
Where's my brother?

18:16.267 --> 18:17.475
What's your brother's name?

18:17.475 --> 18:18.787
Armen.

18:18.787 --> 18:19.788
He was shot.

18:19.788 --> 18:21.100
I--I heard he was in surgery.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.239
Why don't you come
over here with me,

18:22.239 --> 18:24.172
and I can help you
find out his status.

18:34.596 --> 18:35.700
Gun!

18:40.705 --> 18:41.844
Got her.
I got her.

18:43.363 --> 18:45.124
Are you okay?

18:54.547 --> 18:56.376
You have
some acoustic trauma.

18:56.376 --> 18:57.688
What?

18:57.688 --> 18:59.138
I'm kidding, but you can't
set me up like that.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.794
No, but seriously,
it's deafening.

19:00.794 --> 19:02.658
The tinnitus, the ringing, is--

19:02.658 --> 19:04.833
Hey, I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

19:04.833 --> 19:07.146
Yeah, you just might want
to talk into this ear for now.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.320
Will his hearing come back?

19:09.320 --> 19:10.528
Time will tell.

19:10.528 --> 19:12.047
The trauma caused inflammation,

19:12.047 --> 19:15.119
and we can't assess the full
damage until that subsides.

19:15.119 --> 19:16.534
You were very lucky.

19:16.534 --> 19:17.811
A few more inches to the right,

19:17.811 --> 19:19.951
and you wouldn't
be here anymore.

19:22.575 --> 19:25.060
She is exaggerating.
It was not that close.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.993
Anything near you
is too close.

19:26.993 --> 19:28.270
Fair enough.

19:28.270 --> 19:29.685
Did you get to see
the fertility doctor?

19:29.685 --> 19:30.997
No, I heard
you were in trouble,

19:30.997 --> 19:32.205
and I ran out of there.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.415
Bailey Nune?

19:39.005 --> 19:40.524
Bailey Nune?

19:44.700 --> 19:47.013
Thanks for helping
with the pre-raid on this one.

19:47.013 --> 19:48.290
That's burn after reading.

19:48.290 --> 19:49.395
Fun.

19:49.395 --> 19:50.741
Well, technically
we shred it.

19:50.741 --> 19:52.018
Make sure this information
never leaves the room.

19:52.018 --> 19:53.778
So memorize it, destroy it.

19:53.778 --> 19:55.953
Shredder's in the back.
- Yes, sir.

19:55.953 --> 19:58.162
Sorry you got put on point.
Grey was short-staffed.

19:58.162 --> 19:59.819
I just needed somebody
who knew which way was up.

19:59.819 --> 20:01.269
No problem.
Happy to help wherever needed.

20:01.269 --> 20:02.546
Cool.

20:02.546 --> 20:05.204
Hey, I--I do have
some questions, though.

20:07.723 --> 20:09.138
What's up
with the stacking order?

20:09.138 --> 20:11.071
Where's the secondary
entry point and the chase car?

20:11.071 --> 20:12.521
Hey, whoa.
I appreciate your help,

20:12.521 --> 20:14.937
but it's my operation.
It's my team.

20:14.937 --> 20:16.525
Try not to go
picking it apart, right?

20:16.525 --> 20:18.493
No, I'm not.
Just, it's Barrio Rosa.

20:18.493 --> 20:19.632
They come strapped
at all times.

20:19.632 --> 20:20.633
And I don't see
certain things--

20:20.633 --> 20:21.841
Are you serious?

20:21.841 --> 20:23.601
These guys feel like
you let them down.

20:23.601 --> 20:25.258
You quit on us
when we welcomed you,

20:25.258 --> 20:26.294
and now you got the nerve
to come back

20:26.294 --> 20:27.985
and give me notes
on my ops plan?

20:27.985 --> 20:29.435
Okay, this isn't
about me giving notes.

20:29.435 --> 20:30.988
I'm just trying to be helpful.
- Yeah, well, don't.

20:30.988 --> 20:33.128
Nobody wants to hear from the
guy who got bounced for cause.

20:33.128 --> 20:35.406
All right, this is my ops plan,

20:35.406 --> 20:37.477
and you're gonna fall in line
or I'm gonna kick your ass

20:37.477 --> 20:39.548
all over the parking lot
when this is done.

20:44.173 --> 20:45.278
All right, folks.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.729
Briefing time.
Listen up.

20:47.729 --> 20:50.249
Well, you've been
very unhelpful.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.319
Do you have
any more of those cards?

20:51.319 --> 20:53.079
Yeah.

20:53.079 --> 20:56.151
Just be careful
with your gun on that side.

20:56.151 --> 20:57.256
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.740
Yeah,
there's suspects everywhere.

20:58.740 --> 21:00.500
Yeah, it becomes
second nature at some point,

21:00.500 --> 21:02.191
like breathing.

21:02.191 --> 21:03.745
Hi.

21:03.745 --> 21:04.746
Okay, what's your name?

21:04.746 --> 21:05.850
Bite me.

21:05.850 --> 21:07.852
That's--that's catchy.

21:07.852 --> 21:09.716
Have your parents been notified
that you're here?

21:09.716 --> 21:10.855
I don't need them.

21:10.855 --> 21:12.409
Well, yeah,
technically you still do.

21:12.409 --> 21:14.238
What are you, 15?

21:14.238 --> 21:15.550
Please.

21:15.550 --> 21:16.930
I'm 18.

21:16.930 --> 21:19.139
Please.
It has been a very long day,

21:19.139 --> 21:20.934
and you are clearly closer
to being a child

21:20.934 --> 21:22.350
than you are a man,
so just--

21:25.249 --> 21:27.424
Bitch, I'm more of a man
than you've ever had.

21:30.910 --> 21:32.152
What did you say to me?
Say it again.

21:32.152 --> 21:34.223
Get up.

21:34.223 --> 21:35.397
Wait, what are you doing?

21:35.397 --> 21:37.986
Taking him somewhere else
to talk.

21:37.986 --> 21:40.160
Let's try this again,
without your friends around.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.990
Okay? Name.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.543
I told you.

21:43.543 --> 21:45.027
Bite me.

21:45.027 --> 21:46.270
Can you head back out
to the waiting room

21:46.270 --> 21:47.720
and see if anybody knows
the name of the kid

21:47.720 --> 21:50.032
who's spilling
Eastern Front secrets?

21:50.032 --> 21:51.517
- You wouldn't do that.
- Hm?

21:51.517 --> 21:52.587
She's not gonna do that.

21:52.587 --> 21:53.864
I'll do whatever
she tells me to.

21:53.864 --> 21:55.555
I'm a rookie, and she's my TO.

21:55.555 --> 21:57.626
But we're gonna find out
your name no matter what.

21:57.626 --> 21:59.732
So why are you sweating us?

22:02.286 --> 22:04.115
Fine. I'm Slak.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.325
Thank you.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.636
Babayan.

22:09.051 --> 22:12.158
All right, and you are
an Eastern Front wannabe.

22:12.158 --> 22:13.987
Nothing wannabe about me.

22:13.987 --> 22:15.403
I'm all in, and they know it.

22:15.403 --> 22:17.094
No doubt.

22:17.094 --> 22:18.475
I think you should want
to help us figure out

22:18.475 --> 22:19.855
who killed your boss.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.963
- Armen's dead?
- Yeah.

22:23.963 --> 22:26.862
He died about an hour ago
on the operating table.

22:26.862 --> 22:29.244
Did you happen to see
who pulled the trigger?

22:29.244 --> 22:31.142
- No.
- No?

22:31.142 --> 22:32.972
The blood splatter on your face

22:32.972 --> 22:34.732
and your clothes
says otherwise.

22:34.732 --> 22:36.734
I'd say you were standing right
next to him when it went down.

22:36.734 --> 22:38.460
Wrong.

22:38.460 --> 22:42.326
Listen, Slak,

22:42.326 --> 22:44.397
if you have a name,
just give it to us, okay?

22:44.397 --> 22:46.744
There's no reason anyone needs
to know that it came from you.

22:46.744 --> 22:48.159
But it just points us
in the right direction

22:48.159 --> 22:49.264
so we can go and make a case.

22:49.264 --> 22:50.472
Forget it.

22:50.472 --> 22:52.301
I mean, even if I did know
who killed him,

22:52.301 --> 22:53.406
that's for us to handle.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.166
Us?

22:55.166 --> 22:56.651
Do you really have that in you

22:56.651 --> 22:58.446
after what you just
went through,

22:58.446 --> 23:01.449
watching your friends
get shot and stabbed

23:01.449 --> 23:03.382
right in front of you?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.453
You have barely got a foot
in the life right now.

23:05.453 --> 23:08.490
You can still walk away.
But you go all in on a murder,

23:08.490 --> 23:10.147
and your fate is sealed.

23:10.147 --> 23:11.735
You understand?

23:11.735 --> 23:13.219
You don't have to do that.

23:22.815 --> 23:24.989
It was...

23:24.989 --> 23:26.922
it was the big Russian
Nave shot...

23:29.787 --> 23:31.237
<i>Kostya.</i>

23:42.731 --> 23:45.458
Ms. Stevens,
how are you feeling?

23:45.458 --> 23:48.012
Not terrible,
all things considered.

23:48.012 --> 23:49.945
Have you gotten an ID
on my attacker yet?

23:49.945 --> 23:52.638
No, his prints aren't
in the system,

23:52.638 --> 23:54.053
and he's still not talking.

23:54.053 --> 23:55.537
Hasn't even asked for a lawyer.

23:55.537 --> 23:57.643
Well, as a lawyer,
I think he's being an idiot.

23:57.643 --> 23:59.023
But as his victim,

23:59.023 --> 24:01.301
I hope he waives his rights
and confesses.

24:01.301 --> 24:02.406
I hear you.

24:02.406 --> 24:03.925
But you can rest easy for now.

24:03.925 --> 24:05.754
I'll be outside his room
until shift change,

24:05.754 --> 24:07.446
and then another officer
will replace me.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.792
You'll be safe here.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.349
Thank you, Officer.
I so appreciate that.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.324
So that's Armen's killer?

24:24.324 --> 24:25.705
You trust the ID?

24:25.705 --> 24:27.604
I mean, kid was shaken up,
but he seemed genuine.

24:27.604 --> 24:30.054
Yeah, it also makes sense in
why the shooter targeted him.

24:30.054 --> 24:31.297
All right, well,
if they tried once,

24:31.297 --> 24:32.643
they might make
another run at him.

24:32.643 --> 24:34.438
Post up here, and we'll
try to get more evidence.

24:34.438 --> 24:35.715
Yeah, you got it.

24:38.062 --> 24:39.201
Hey.

24:39.201 --> 24:41.410
Lucy Chen, Celina Juarez,
Mid-Wilshire.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.205
Liz Diamond, Hollywood.

24:43.205 --> 24:44.897
You pulled in
on the gang war?

24:44.897 --> 24:46.657
No, home invasion.

24:46.657 --> 24:48.245
Guy in there attacked
some lawyer.

24:48.245 --> 24:49.522
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

24:49.522 --> 24:50.834
Monica.
- You know her?

24:50.834 --> 24:53.181
Yeah, I mean,
she's a real piece of work.

24:53.181 --> 24:54.562
Any idea who the guy is?

24:54.562 --> 24:56.529
None. He hasn't said a word.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.669
So he's either
disciplined or scared.

25:01.396 --> 25:03.191
Are we still taking
surveillance notes?

25:03.191 --> 25:04.986
Negative.

25:04.986 --> 25:07.195
Okay, so what should
we be doing then?

25:07.195 --> 25:08.507
Making sure no one sneaks up

25:08.507 --> 25:09.853
on our people
once they're inside.

25:09.853 --> 25:11.061
We cover their twelve.

25:11.061 --> 25:12.545
Rear point covers their six.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.271
Copy that.

25:14.271 --> 25:17.101
<i>- Front point clear?</i>
- Clear.

25:17.101 --> 25:19.034
<i>- Rear point clear?
- Clear.</i>

25:19.034 --> 25:21.002
<i>Then we're green and go.</i>

25:29.458 --> 25:30.736
Breaching.

25:31.978 --> 25:33.255
Move, move, move, move.

25:43.852 --> 25:45.647
Patrol, 7-Adam-100.

25:45.647 --> 25:47.511
Officers down.
Repeat, officers down!

25:47.511 --> 25:48.961
Help!

25:58.557 --> 25:59.765
Finally.

25:59.765 --> 26:01.318
Yeah, sorry about all
the missed appointments.

26:01.318 --> 26:03.700
Not at all.
It's been a crazy day.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.977
How are you both?

26:04.977 --> 26:06.323
Great.

26:06.323 --> 26:08.497
Not great.
In the middle.

26:08.497 --> 26:10.741
Well, I'm glad we're
getting a chance to talk.

26:10.741 --> 26:11.880
Because there's a problem?

26:11.880 --> 26:13.261
I wouldn't call it a problem.

26:13.261 --> 26:15.090
I'd call it an obstacle.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.541
But obstacles can be overcome.
- I knew it.

26:17.541 --> 26:20.199
Okay, please tell me
that I am the obstacle.

26:20.199 --> 26:22.028
I mean,
I've already had a child,

26:22.028 --> 26:24.652
but it was a long,
long time ago.

26:24.652 --> 26:25.722
Maybe something's changed.

26:25.722 --> 26:27.620
No, your sperm density
is adequate.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.001
But my ovaries aren't.

26:29.001 --> 26:31.348
It's not your ovaries,
which is good.

26:31.348 --> 26:33.074
But there's some damage
to your fallopian tubes,

26:33.074 --> 26:34.834
which is making it difficult
for your eggs

26:34.834 --> 26:37.354
to move from the ovaries
to the uterus.

26:37.354 --> 26:40.529
The good news is, we can
get around that with IVF.

26:40.529 --> 26:42.014
- In vitro?
- Yes.

26:42.014 --> 26:43.705
Now, obviously, at your age,
you're considered

26:43.705 --> 26:45.845
a geriatric pregnancy--

26:45.845 --> 26:48.089
a technical term no one loves.

26:48.089 --> 26:51.195
But after 35, there are
increased risk factors.

26:51.195 --> 26:53.542
That said,
I see no reason that,

26:53.542 --> 26:55.130
in time,
you can't get pregnant.

26:55.130 --> 26:58.237
Okay. That's great, right?

26:58.237 --> 26:59.652
How much time?

26:59.652 --> 27:01.861
The IVF process takes
six to eight weeks,

27:01.861 --> 27:03.656
but the odds of it working
on the first try

27:03.656 --> 27:04.692
are on the lower side.

27:04.692 --> 27:05.762
And it's expensive.

27:05.762 --> 27:08.281
But we don't care
about the money.

27:08.281 --> 27:12.631
A single IVF cycle normally
costs 15,000 to 20,000.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.322
Whatever it takes.

27:14.322 --> 27:17.187
I think you two should take
a little time to digest this.

27:17.187 --> 27:19.845
Let's have a follow-up meeting
next week to discuss further.

27:19.845 --> 27:21.778
- Right.
- Thanks.

27:35.861 --> 27:37.517
I love you.

27:37.517 --> 27:39.416
I love you too.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.073
Wanna go find
a quiet place to cry?

27:41.073 --> 27:42.384
Yep.

27:46.734 --> 27:48.252
Hey. Hey.

27:48.252 --> 27:50.427
What happened?
- It was a booby trap.

27:50.427 --> 27:51.911
They clearly knew
the raid was coming.

27:51.911 --> 27:52.912
Left an IED behind.

27:52.912 --> 27:54.707
Are you two okay?

27:54.707 --> 27:56.260
Yeah, nothing--
nothing critical,

27:56.260 --> 27:57.434
a little banged up.

27:57.434 --> 27:59.263
We were, um...

27:59.263 --> 28:00.644
we were pulling out
Mad Dog and Nash

28:00.644 --> 28:02.611
when half the ceiling
came down on us.

28:02.611 --> 28:04.821
How bad are they wounded?

28:04.821 --> 28:06.270
Nash is bad.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.790
Shrapnel wounds
to the head and torso.

28:08.790 --> 28:11.172
Garcia was behind him,
leg got all torn up.

28:11.172 --> 28:12.794
Mad Dog got lucky.

28:12.794 --> 28:14.969
The first two took
the brunt of the blast.

28:14.969 --> 28:16.695
He's a pincushion,
but according to the medic,

28:16.695 --> 28:17.972
it's mostly superficial.

28:17.972 --> 28:20.491
Look, it's clear that
they knew we were coming.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.424
It seems like they knew
what door we would be using.

28:22.424 --> 28:24.254
You think there's a leak?

28:24.254 --> 28:25.911
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

28:25.911 --> 28:27.498
The mission was last-minute.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.845
It was close to the vest.

28:28.845 --> 28:32.055
I mean, other than Metro
and the two observation units,

28:32.055 --> 28:34.160
only the judge who signed
the warrant was in the loop.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.575
All right.

28:35.575 --> 28:37.060
You two get patched up.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.131
Uh, sir.

28:39.131 --> 28:40.719
I wanna help figure out
what happened.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.961
Yeah, me too.

28:41.961 --> 28:43.825
As long as you get cleared
by the doctor.

28:43.825 --> 28:46.241
I'll coordinate
with their lieutenant.

28:46.241 --> 28:47.795
But let's keep this quiet.

28:47.795 --> 28:50.729
Last thing we need is word
of a mole hunt getting around.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.937
Yes, sir.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.561
Maybe it's just
not meant to be.

28:55.561 --> 28:56.631
Nonsense.

28:56.631 --> 28:58.184
Millions of people
go through this.

28:58.184 --> 28:59.703
That's what science is for.

28:59.703 --> 29:01.463
I know, but--

29:01.463 --> 29:03.258
But what?

29:03.258 --> 29:04.777
Nothing.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.193
It's just--it's a lot
to process, you know?

29:07.193 --> 29:10.438
Yes, and we will
process it together.

29:10.438 --> 29:12.060
Yeah.

29:16.547 --> 29:17.548
What?

29:17.548 --> 29:18.964
That's Armen's brother,

29:18.964 --> 29:20.966
the dead leader
of the Eastern Front gang.

29:20.966 --> 29:22.070
You think something's up?

29:22.070 --> 29:23.485
I think his dead brother's

29:23.485 --> 29:24.728
already downstairs
in the morgue,

29:24.728 --> 29:26.592
so what's he doing
on a patient floor?

29:26.592 --> 29:28.732
- You wanna follow him?
- You up for that?

29:28.732 --> 29:30.734
Yes, I'm dying
for something else to focus on.

29:30.734 --> 29:32.011
Let's go.

29:42.228 --> 29:43.678
Don't look at me like that.

29:43.678 --> 29:47.026
Nah, the only way I'm looking
at you is with empathy.

29:47.026 --> 29:50.098
I've been in that bed,
worrying about my guys,

29:50.098 --> 29:53.412
wondering if there's anything
I could have done differently.

29:53.412 --> 29:55.345
Sometimes things just go wrong.

29:55.345 --> 29:57.209
I'm not buying it.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.797
I think you're standing there

29:58.797 --> 30:00.281
thinking I should have
listened to you.

30:00.281 --> 30:02.248
No, no, no.
This--this wasn't about

30:02.248 --> 30:03.732
quality of mission plan.

30:03.732 --> 30:05.217
This was a trap.

30:05.217 --> 30:08.289
Nah, the question is, how did
they know you were coming?

30:08.289 --> 30:09.808
I don't know.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.948
I mean, we played it as close
to the vest as we could.

30:15.296 --> 30:16.538
Dr. London.

30:16.538 --> 30:18.678
I heard what happened.

30:18.678 --> 30:20.577
Ran over to make sure
everyone was okay.

30:20.577 --> 30:22.406
Thanks, Doc.

30:22.406 --> 30:24.581
Yeah, I think we're all
pretty far from okay.

30:24.581 --> 30:27.239
Of course.
That was stupid of me.

30:28.481 --> 30:31.726
Do you need anything?
Is there someone I should call?

30:31.726 --> 30:34.349
Nah. We're all squared away.

30:35.592 --> 30:39.044
Hey, I'm curious, how did
you hear about the ambush?

30:39.044 --> 30:40.045
Are you kidding?

30:40.045 --> 30:41.563
It's all
everybody can talk about.

30:41.563 --> 30:43.393
That and the gang war.

30:43.393 --> 30:44.808
Half my patients today canceled

30:44.808 --> 30:47.052
because they got called
into work.

30:47.052 --> 30:49.813
I'm so sorry that this happened
to you and your guys.

30:53.368 --> 30:55.060
I'll say a prayer.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.929
She seemed like the last
person you wanted to see.

31:01.929 --> 31:03.585
No, I just...

31:05.553 --> 31:07.382
I'm in no mood to talk
about my feelings.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.144
Look, man, I'm a wreck,

31:10.144 --> 31:11.835
and they shot me
full of painkillers,

31:11.835 --> 31:14.527
so I'm shutting down
for a while.

31:14.527 --> 31:16.805
Yeah, I get it.

31:16.805 --> 31:19.670
I'll check back with you
after Nash's surgery.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.465
Thanks.

31:40.553 --> 31:43.211
Nothing suspicious
about him having to pee.

31:43.211 --> 31:45.041
No.

31:45.041 --> 31:47.284
Do me a favor.
Go find Celina and Lucy.

31:47.284 --> 31:49.286
Tell them I think
trouble's brewing.

31:49.286 --> 31:50.667
Where are you going?

31:50.667 --> 31:51.979
To tinkle.

31:59.158 --> 32:00.401
No worries.
I can wait.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.680
Hey.
John wanted me to tell you--

32:09.686 --> 32:11.136
- Shots fired.

32:11.136 --> 32:13.552
South building,
second floor, east hallway.

32:13.552 --> 32:15.140
Move, come on.
We gotta go.

32:18.522 --> 32:20.248
Take her.
Okay, go, go.

32:21.284 --> 32:23.148
Liz, I need you.
Lock yourself in my guy's room.

32:23.148 --> 32:24.390
Protect him at all costs.

32:24.390 --> 32:26.013
These shooters are probably
here to kill him.

32:55.594 --> 32:56.629
Agh!

33:02.842 --> 33:04.879
- Got me?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:37.946 --> 33:39.534
Told you we weren't done.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.560
Let's talk.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.055
Police! Drop your weapon!

34:20.472 --> 34:21.887
You got nowhere to go, Aram!

34:21.887 --> 34:25.442
And a hospital full of cops
who are heading this way.

34:25.442 --> 34:28.169
So give up now or get buried
next to your brother.

34:55.783 --> 34:57.164
Turn around.

34:57.164 --> 34:59.407
Hands on your head.
Interlace your fingers.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.964
I'm only gonna ask you once.

35:06.242 --> 35:07.898
Failure to answer or lie to me,

35:07.898 --> 35:10.522
and I will detonate your heart
with an air bubble.

35:10.522 --> 35:12.351
Who sent you?

35:12.351 --> 35:13.939
Go to hell.

35:18.357 --> 35:19.738
I'll meet you there.

35:42.450 --> 35:44.797
What are you doing here?

35:44.797 --> 35:47.179
Barrio Rosa blew up my cops.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.147
You said no one
was gonna get hurt.

35:50.596 --> 35:51.908
Did you just kill that guy?

35:51.908 --> 35:53.358
You don't want me
to answer that.

35:53.358 --> 35:54.876
Now get the hell out of here.
I will call you

35:54.876 --> 35:56.084
when I am released.

35:56.084 --> 35:57.362
Go!

36:00.675 --> 36:03.126
Liz, we're Code 4.
You can unlock the door.

36:04.886 --> 36:05.956
How bad?

36:05.956 --> 36:07.406
Two Eastern Front shooters
are down.

36:07.406 --> 36:09.028
A couple of citizens with GSWs.

36:09.028 --> 36:10.340
I mean, it's a mess.

36:10.340 --> 36:12.342
Thanks for having our back.
- Of course.

36:17.658 --> 36:20.592
No. No, no.

36:20.592 --> 36:22.973
I need a Code Blue unit now!

36:24.354 --> 36:25.907
- What happened?
- I-I don't know.

36:25.907 --> 36:27.288
I went to protect
the Russian shooter.

36:27.288 --> 36:29.221
I didn't think--
- So he was alone?

36:29.221 --> 36:31.119
Yeah. I'm sorry.

36:39.162 --> 36:40.991
What the hell is going on
out there?

36:40.991 --> 36:43.166
You've been here
the whole time?

36:43.166 --> 36:44.823
Are you kidding?

36:44.823 --> 36:47.826
The second I heard gunfire,
I hid in the corner.

36:47.826 --> 36:49.172
What kind of
half-assed policing

36:49.172 --> 36:50.173
are you guys practicing?

36:50.173 --> 36:51.278
Shut up.

36:51.278 --> 36:52.796
The guy who attacked you
just coded.

36:52.796 --> 36:56.283
I'm having a hard time thinking
it was just an accident.

36:56.283 --> 36:57.594
Oh.

37:00.563 --> 37:05.015
You need to tread
very carefully, Angela.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.327
I warned you what would happen

37:06.327 --> 37:08.226
if you tried to make me
the bad guy

37:08.226 --> 37:10.469
when it was my home
that was invaded

37:10.469 --> 37:12.713
and me who was
viciously assaulted.

37:12.713 --> 37:15.233
If we find the slightest bit
of evidence

37:15.233 --> 37:18.650
that you lied to us
at any point,

37:18.650 --> 37:21.273
things are gonna get
real serious between us.

37:25.484 --> 37:27.348
Leave.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.767
Now.

37:37.531 --> 37:40.085
Have I mentioned
how much I hate her recently?

37:40.085 --> 37:42.294
That goes without saying,
but she is not wrong.

37:42.294 --> 37:45.884
Unless we find rock-solid
evidence that she was involved,

37:45.884 --> 37:47.368
we keep our suspicions
to ourselves,

37:47.368 --> 37:49.439
because she will destroy us.

37:56.929 --> 37:58.552
Okay, are you sure it's okay
I stay here tonight?

37:58.552 --> 38:00.657
Technically, I'm not
paying rent until tomorrow.

38:00.657 --> 38:02.832
Girl, stop.
Of course.

38:02.832 --> 38:04.489
Look, your stuff is in boxes.

38:04.489 --> 38:06.145
You can sleep on the couch

38:06.145 --> 38:07.630
and meet the movers
in the morning.

38:07.630 --> 38:08.872
Thanks.

38:11.979 --> 38:13.774
I think we handled today
really well.

38:13.774 --> 38:14.913
I agree.

38:14.913 --> 38:16.984
I--I really tried
to be respectful

38:16.984 --> 38:18.468
with the--the corrections.

38:18.468 --> 38:19.883
And I tried to be receptive,

38:19.883 --> 38:22.472
although I gotta say,
you're my fourth TO so far,

38:22.472 --> 38:24.371
and you all do things
a little differently.

38:24.371 --> 38:26.338
You will too,
once you graduate.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.133
You just have to take the best
of what's offered

38:28.133 --> 38:30.204
and make the job your own.

38:30.204 --> 38:34.070
So, um, I've actually saved
two very special bath bombs,

38:34.070 --> 38:36.693
and one has your name on it--
if you want, of course.

38:36.693 --> 38:38.316
- Oh, my God.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.559
Best roommate ever.

38:40.559 --> 38:42.285
Enjoy.

38:42.285 --> 38:44.563
<i>â™ª When the sun won't shine

38:44.563 --> 38:47.463

38:47.463 --> 38:48.947

38:51.950 --> 38:53.952
Aww.

38:53.952 --> 38:55.574
How are you?

38:56.886 --> 38:58.474
I miss you.

Okay.

40:04.919 --> 40:06.196
Red or white?

40:06.196 --> 40:07.439
Yes.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.579
Shall I just mix them
together in a glass?

40:09.579 --> 40:11.650
Just pour the white.

40:11.650 --> 40:15.965
<i>â™ª Oh, this trouble's only

40:15.965 --> 40:18.416
- What a day.
- Yeah.

40:19.865 --> 40:24.007
So you don't have to make
any decisions tonight.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.078
I know.

40:28.736 --> 40:31.152
But you already have.

40:31.152 --> 40:33.051
Yeah.
I don't think I can

40:33.051 --> 40:36.295
go down the rabbit hole of IVF,

40:36.295 --> 40:38.988
week after week,
month after month

40:38.988 --> 40:44.476
of trying, hoping, and failing.

40:45.891 --> 40:47.306
Not to mention the cost of it.

40:47.306 --> 40:48.687
I--
- I get it.

40:48.687 --> 40:50.413
No, I get it.
I understand.

40:52.035 --> 40:54.969
But if you change your mind,

40:54.969 --> 40:56.281
I'm in.

40:56.281 --> 40:58.490
<i>â™ª Yeah, we're gonna be
all right â™ª</i>

40:58.490 --> 41:03.391
<i>â™ª Oh, child,
lift up your head â™ª</i>

41:03.391 --> 41:06.464
<i>â™ª And the light's
gonna find you â™ª</i>

41:06.464 --> 41:07.948
The hell are you doing
up here?

41:07.948 --> 41:09.432
Nash is paralyzed.

41:09.432 --> 41:11.572
I heard.

41:11.572 --> 41:13.298
They think
it might be temporary.

41:14.575 --> 41:16.750
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

41:16.750 --> 41:18.268
What do you mean?

41:21.893 --> 41:23.722
Did you compromise the op?

41:27.692 --> 41:31.419
They were just supposed to
clear out before we got there.

41:31.419 --> 41:33.560
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.975
Who did you tell?

41:36.459 --> 41:37.425
I can't.

41:37.425 --> 41:38.530
Why not?

41:38.530 --> 41:41.360
Because she knows
all my secrets.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.466
Who does?

41:43.466 --> 41:44.502
I'm sorry.

42:39.315 --> 42:40.350
<i>Damn it.</i>
