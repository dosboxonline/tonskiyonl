00:01.436 --> 00:03.481
<i>Previously on
"Resident Alien"...</i>

00:03.481 --> 00:05.135
Hello, Harry.
My name is Joseph.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.310
You are a Grey.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.790
I will call you Dickhead.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.357
<i>You should be
helping each other,</i>

00:09.357 --> 00:11.446
not trying to kill one another.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.187
There's a secret
base in Wyoming.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.971
It's where I suspect they
keep all their information

00:14.971 --> 00:16.755
on the Greys.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.845
Please save my son.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.326
There is only one person
who may have the resources

00:22.326 --> 00:23.675
to stop the Greys--

00:23.675 --> 00:26.504
an Air Force general
named Eleanor McCallister.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.158
Tell me what's
going on right now.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.334
That's my secret.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.467
You're a dinosaur.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.034
What?

01:17.120 --> 01:20.341
And lay on bed.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.519
Damn it.

01:24.519 --> 01:27.174
Well, you got the "leave him
inside the house" part right.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.663
Mm.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.322
Morning.
- Morning.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.283
How'd you sleep?

01:49.283 --> 01:50.762
Mm, great.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.851
But I did roll
off the bed again.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.725
Well, I guess
it's better than sleepwalking

01:56.725 --> 01:58.074
and waking up outside.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.250
Mm, that's true.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.165
It's freezing this morning.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.996
How do you know that?

02:09.346 --> 02:11.174
I don't know.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.697
Hmm.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.005
Hmm.

<i>My earliest memory was

03:40.437 --> 03:43.266
<i>When I hatched,
I was greeted by the mewling</i>

03:43.266 --> 03:45.225
<i>of hundreds of siblings.</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:47.052
<i>We all preferred solitude.</i>

03:47.052 --> 03:51.492
<i>So naturally, we set
upon killing each other.</i>

03:51.492 --> 03:53.320
<i>It is different here on Earth.</i>

03:53.320 --> 03:56.061
<i>They get strength from each

03:56.061 --> 03:59.282
<i>Human babies cannot even live

03:59.282 --> 04:02.067
<i>It is probably a good thing
because if human babies</i>

04:02.067 --> 04:04.896
<i>could kill,
they would certainly do it.</i>

04:04.896 --> 04:06.724
What have you done here?

04:06.724 --> 04:08.248
Ooh!

04:08.248 --> 04:11.294
This is garbage.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.469
Get out of here.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.297
Go back to your desk.

04:14.297 --> 04:17.039
Maybe take a break
for the rest of the week.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.780
I'll do it.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.217
<i>If these are the top
human thinkers on Earth,</i>

04:21.217 --> 04:24.873
<i>then we are all as dead as my
siblings' mangled carcasses.</i>

04:27.397 --> 04:29.181
You've been here a week,

04:29.181 --> 04:31.488
and output has slowed
to a stop.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.185
I am the only one working.

04:33.185 --> 04:36.754
Because you're taking
everyone's assignments.

04:36.754 --> 04:39.104
I am the smartest being here.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.758
It is just easier if I do it.

04:40.758 --> 04:44.545
Lieutenant, why are
the Grey aliens on Earth?

04:44.545 --> 04:46.198
We don't know yet because

04:46.198 --> 04:48.331
Harry isn't being
a team player.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.333
Look, we need
to work together if we're

04:50.333 --> 04:51.508
going to stop the Greys.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.075
I should be employee
of the month.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.817
I saved everyone's butt
here last week.

04:55.817 --> 04:59.647
These are spacecraft we've
acquired in the last 80 years.

04:59.647 --> 05:04.391
This one might still have
its weapon system intact.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.308
Oh.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.139
This is live.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.012
Oh.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.361
Is that a countdown?

05:18.361 --> 05:22.147
Get behind the blast doors!

05:24.802 --> 05:26.630
That was lucky.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.415
You need to fall in line.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.068
You're part of a team now.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.742
Cave in! The roof!

05:51.742 --> 05:54.963
Whoa.

05:54.963 --> 05:58.749
Hey, you got up early
to make me coffee?

05:58.749 --> 06:01.448
Mm-hmm.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.666
Thank you.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.364
I'm building up goodwill.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.061
I'm on the late shift
next week,

06:06.061 --> 06:08.933
so I've got a full week of 4:00
a.m. drunk slumber parties.

06:08.933 --> 06:12.023
Oh, that's great.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.112
Great.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.074
Anything good?

06:20.467 --> 06:22.033
Nah.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.861
Just some boring stuff.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.254
I hate living in a small town.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.125
It's like, why do they
even have a paper, right?

06:27.125 --> 06:28.300
Wait.
What is it?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.433
Nothing.
Please don't look at it.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.608
Hmm.

06:31.608 --> 06:35.177
I mean, so what?

06:35.177 --> 06:36.483
You're not upset?

06:36.483 --> 06:38.049
No, I don't care what
some stupid

06:38.049 --> 06:39.529
paper says about me.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.965
Yeah, right.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.445
I mean, look.

06:42.445 --> 06:45.230
Last year, you were
lying to me about Harry,

06:45.230 --> 06:48.408
and I thought I was losing you,
and it threw me.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.671
But now it's different.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.022
All right.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.111
I'm proud of you.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.678
Thank you.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.550
Oh, um, I'm going
to lock my door

07:00.550 --> 07:02.073
when you come home at 4:00 a.m.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.640
No, my bed's a block
of ice, and I pick locks,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.773
so get your warm feet ready.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.915
So that climbing gym
that my son and I

07:17.915 --> 07:19.656
go to is actually pretty good.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.136
You should check
it out sometime.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.572
Oh, I'd love to.

07:22.572 --> 07:23.878
You know, I've been
working out at home.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.488
I curl Cletus
three times a day.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.144
Here you go.
Whenever you're ready.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.406
Thank you very much.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.494
It's OK, I got it.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.496
20-- there we go.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.541
OK.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.500
Well, I am off to work.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.110
Have a good day.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.895
All right.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.246
- Hi, Liv.
- Hey.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.206
Did you see that?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.599
Lena paid for breakfast.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.514
And she paid for dinner
once last week.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.516
Wow, yeah.
That's like, wow.

07:53.516 --> 07:56.301
You should be so
angry and stuff.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.694
Why, again?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.522
Because that's not
the natural order of things.

07:59.522 --> 08:00.915
All right, men pay, women eat.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.743
This goes back
to caveman times.

08:02.743 --> 08:03.961
The men, they--
they go out on a hunt, right?

08:03.961 --> 08:05.485
And then they take
down a dinosaur.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.487
And they drag it back
to the hut, and then the women,

08:07.487 --> 08:08.966
they prepare the cutlery
and the lemonade,

08:08.966 --> 08:11.012
then they all sit down,
say grace, and eat.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.189
To think just one statement
could contain 200 million

08:14.189 --> 08:15.451
years of misinformation.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.279
Mm.

08:17.279 --> 08:21.501
Sir, I printed out this still
from the CCTV footage the day

08:21.501 --> 08:22.937
Peter Bach was killed.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.069
I think finding this guy
in the passenger seat

08:25.069 --> 08:27.507
is the key to our
whole investigation.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.030
Hey, what are you doing?
Not here.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.771
You never know who got eyes
and ears on us, all right?

08:30.771 --> 08:32.555
We'll look
at this picture later.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.166
I don't think
I want to anymore.

08:35.166 --> 08:38.169
I just really think we
should go to the reservation.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.041
Hi, Sheriff.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.827
Get the V-A-N.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.787
You need to leave
that V-A-N alone.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.745
It's been there for a week.

08:48.745 --> 08:51.574
I want to check for

08:51.574 --> 08:54.577
F-I-N-G-E-R-P-R-I-N-T-S.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.972
H-E-L-L-L-L no.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.930
You had two fake cops
show up at your place.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.193
Whoever we're dealing with,
they're professional

09:02.193 --> 09:03.934
and they're well-funded.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.675
Look, there goes
a damn government

09:05.675 --> 09:07.808
drone watching us right now.

09:07.808 --> 09:10.027
I think that's just some
mustard on the window.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.551
That's what they
want you to think.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.074
You gotta trust no one, Deputy.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.249
Head on a swivel.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.555
You ain't never
really safe until you

09:15.555 --> 09:16.904
learn to look behind yourself.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.209
Go ahead, watch your back.
Go ahead.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.297
Do it.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.516
You want me to turn my--

09:20.516 --> 09:22.605
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.868
Harder.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.043
There you go.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.131
Ow!

09:27.131 --> 09:28.176
Now, you do that
nine times a day,

09:28.176 --> 09:30.352
in 16 weeks,
you'll have owl neck.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.701
But I don't want owl neck.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.442
Everybody want an owl neck!

09:33.442 --> 09:35.879

09:49.371 --> 09:51.721
Good morning, Deputy.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.897
Someone found this
by the bus stop.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.030
Oh, thank you, Val.

09:56.030 --> 09:59.424
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.451
What do we got here, Deputy?

10:26.451 --> 10:29.411
Oh, someone found
it near the bus stop.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.413
I'll go through it
and see who it belongs to.

10:31.413 --> 10:32.632
Oh, whoa, no, no.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.198
You're not here to do--

10:34.198 --> 10:36.679
do clerical work.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.985
You're a deputy
for the Patience

10:37.985 --> 10:39.290
County Sheriff's Department.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.422
Here.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.206
Deputy Liv will process that.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.643
There you go.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.687
It's my lucky day.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.036
See?

10:46.036 --> 10:49.431
Look, uh, I got a gut
feeling that something

10:49.431 --> 10:50.867
might be going down.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.826
So I just want you to keep
your eyes peeled

10:52.826 --> 10:54.392
for anyone suspicious.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.090
Oh, don't worry.

10:56.090 --> 11:00.094
If anybody's up to something,
I'll know it.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.705
Damn, you smell
like a winner.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.499
What do you think?

11:14.499 --> 11:16.153
Purr-fect.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.547
I told you already,
we are not getting a cat.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.984
Eh, you'll change your mind.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.725
Harry, where have you been?

11:22.725 --> 11:24.509
Your shift started,
like, an hour ago.

11:24.509 --> 11:28.862
It is the General's fault
for making me work late.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.342
Do not bite my balls.

11:31.342 --> 11:34.519
There is 0% chance
of that happening.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.391
Hello.

11:36.391 --> 11:39.176
I'm looking for
Dr. Harry Vanderspeigle.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.395
I'm Ellen.

11:40.395 --> 11:43.180
I'm the one you're
looking for, officer.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.357
I've broken six laws
since this morning.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.316
Hi. I--

11:50.797 --> 11:52.973
What are you doing here?

11:52.973 --> 11:56.541
And why are you dressed
like it is Halloween?

11:56.541 --> 11:58.761
Oh, I live here now.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.632
Got a job, an apartment.

12:00.632 --> 12:03.418
Figured I'd settle in
till I figure out what it is

12:03.418 --> 12:05.072
you're up to.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.639
You were supposed to leave the
planet on a ship we provided,

12:07.639 --> 12:10.773
but you're still here.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.340
Why?

12:12.340 --> 12:15.343
I do not like
public transportation.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.867
So why don't you
go away, or I will

12:17.867 --> 12:20.261
tell everyone you are a Grey.

12:20.261 --> 12:24.047
Nope, that's against the
Galactic Federation's charter.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.223
Addendum two, command
order five-- no alien

12:26.223 --> 12:28.878
can reveal themselves
or another alien

12:28.878 --> 12:30.532
being to a non-alien.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.622
I have a copy of that charter
right here in my pocket.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.102
It's on page one!

12:37.495 --> 12:40.542
Just know I am watching you,
and I will figure

12:40.542 --> 12:42.065
out what you're doing here.

12:42.065 --> 12:45.199
And I will figure out
what you are doing here.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.896
I'm here to figure out
what you're doing here.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.550
Then I just figured it out.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.769
I win.

12:55.818 --> 12:59.474
She's your friend, isn't she?

12:59.474 --> 13:00.997
She's very pretty.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.217
You stay away from her.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.395
I'm Asta.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.439
Hi, Asta.

13:08.439 --> 13:09.614
I'm Joseph.

13:09.614 --> 13:12.095
Hi.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.358
Well, I'll let you
get back to work.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.273
I just wanted to say hi.

13:16.273 --> 13:20.277
I may have to drop by
more often.

13:20.277 --> 13:24.542
Cool.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.719
I've got to go
do '50s cop stuff.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.896
But want to hang out later?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.201
Shut up.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.595
Come on.

13:33.595 --> 13:37.251

13:37.251 --> 13:38.948

13:40.341 --> 13:41.516

14:15.637 --> 14:18.074

14:18.074 --> 14:20.337
The owl was here
last week, too.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.820
I'm getting new blinds today.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.082
What?

14:26.082 --> 14:27.562
Honey, no way.

14:27.562 --> 14:31.522
It is good luck to have
an owl staring at you.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.089
Why would it be good luck?

14:33.089 --> 14:34.482
I don't know.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.919
I just made it up
to save money on blinds.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.096
Blinds it is.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.756

14:47.756 --> 14:50.237

the day searching my email</i>

14:50.237 --> 14:53.066

14:59.159 --> 15:02.466
<i>So I handled it exactly

15:02.466 --> 15:06.731
<i>I texted Jeff and asked him to

15:08.081 --> 15:10.561
<i>Jeff is a horrible liar.</i>

15:14.000 --> 15:15.523
You need to come to work.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.090
We picked up alien chatter.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.526
I need you to go through it.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.702
Plus you have
to take the HR seminar.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.704
I have something
better than chatter.

15:22.704 --> 15:27.491
I have found someone
who is doing the chattering.

15:27.491 --> 15:30.103
Why do you have
a picture of a boy's chest?

15:30.103 --> 15:32.975
Oh, that's my chest.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.196
I have been manscaping.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.762
Wait.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.634
That's our mole.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.593
That's the man who shot
Peter Bach and my guards.

15:42.593 --> 15:45.205
He is also
a Grey hybrid alien.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.510
He is here.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.470
I have been watching him.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.428
Here he is drinking coffee.

15:51.428 --> 15:54.040
Here he is crossing the street.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.738
This is me after leg day.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.741
Here he is making
a suspicious phone call.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.744
That is my penis.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.267
Yeah.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.748
You're definitely going to
have to take the HR seminar.

16:06.748 --> 16:10.012
Look, we need to find out
what the Greys are up to.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.493
I'll get a team
to go grab this Joseph.

16:12.493 --> 16:16.410
No, no, then they will know
that we are onto them.

16:16.410 --> 16:20.370
I will deal, uh,
with this Joseph myself.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.806
Do not worry.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.156
I have a plan.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.293
<i>I do not have a plan.</i>

16:35.298 --> 16:37.344
I was just
at the comic book store.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.259
The conspiracy kids there
said the Alien Tracker's

16:39.259 --> 16:40.434
death was no accident.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.044
He was murdered.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.915
Those kids don't know
what they're talking about.

16:43.915 --> 16:47.136
They think Bigfoot and
Sasquatch are the same thing.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.442
They are the same thing.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.487
They got to you too.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.533
You're being paranoid.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.622
Those kids are
actually kind of nice.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.537
Maybe you should spend
more time with them,

16:56.537 --> 16:57.755
make some new friends?

16:57.755 --> 17:00.106
I don't need new friends.

17:00.106 --> 17:03.457
Wait, do you not want
to be my friend anymore?

17:03.457 --> 17:07.417
Yes, I'm your friend,
and I protected you.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.593
I didn't tell them
the Alien Tracker's

17:09.593 --> 17:11.334
death was your fault.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.815
What?
How is it my fault?

17:13.815 --> 17:16.513
You sold him out to Harry,
and Harry killed him.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.080
Think about it.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.430
The last time we knew
the Alien Tracker was alive,

17:20.430 --> 17:23.303
he was headed to Harry's cabin.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.479
We have to go there
and sniff around.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.357
Hey, Deputy,
what's the emergency?

17:34.357 --> 17:35.967
I have to tell you something.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.274
Um, but I want
to be very careful,

17:38.274 --> 17:40.450
just in case
we're being watched.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.843
Come here.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.671
<i>♪ Late night radio</i>

17:43.671 --> 17:45.412
<i>♪ Still hear you
singing to me ♪</i>

17:45.412 --> 17:48.328
This way,
if someone is onto us,

17:48.328 --> 17:50.373
nobody can hear
what we're saying.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.462
- You're going haying?
- No.

17:52.462 --> 17:57.598
Listen, that duffel bag belongs
to the Alien Tracker's son.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.296
I found the information
in a diary.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.559
Who-- who has diarrhea?

18:02.559 --> 18:04.518
No, diary!

18:04.518 --> 18:06.868
- Diarrhea?
- Diary!

18:06.868 --> 18:09.958
And I found the name
of the son's therapist.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.525
He lives in Utah.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.310
And get this--
he was murdered last night.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.182
Damn.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.705
Things have taken a turn.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.446
It's no wonder
you got diarrhea.

18:19.446 --> 18:20.577
What?

18:20.577 --> 18:22.275
Your diarrhea.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.146
Listen, we got to get that van.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.235
John's parents aren't safe.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.455
Why do you have diarrhea?

18:28.455 --> 18:30.109
I don't have diarrhea!

18:35.462 --> 18:36.724
I cleared it up.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.640
I ate a bunch
of bananas and toast.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.252
I can't ask Joseph out.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.558
Why not?

18:44.558 --> 18:46.168
He looked at you
like a Christmas ham.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.562
I'm just not ready to date.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.911
Come on.
Look at you.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.174
You're perfect.
You're more than ready.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.481
You're smart, you're funny.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.222
Oh, I would love
to go to a restaurant

18:56.222 --> 18:59.094
where they don't give me a pack
of crayons to color my menu.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.313
Oh.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.445
I guess you're joining us.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.925
No.

19:03.925 --> 19:07.407
I just wanted fries.
These need salt.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.191
It's just too soon.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.106
I barely left Jimmy.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.021
Is this girl talk?

19:13.021 --> 19:14.414
I want to play.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.590
You go, girl.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.331
D'arcy and Kayla
think that I should

19:18.331 --> 19:20.507
ask Deputy Joseph on a date.

19:20.507 --> 19:22.204
You cannot go, girl.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.689
Men ask women out.
Women do not ask men.

19:28.689 --> 19:31.126
It is not their place.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.261
Do you want
to try that again?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.653
He's not even a nurse.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.916
You will have nothing
to talk about.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.918
Have you ever been on a date?

19:40.918 --> 19:43.356
He has.
Not much of a talker.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.748
Kisses like a goat.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.402
- Ew.
- Thank you.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.838
Look.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.623
Sometimes it's nice to
meet new people, you know?

19:49.623 --> 19:51.538
Get to know them.

19:51.538 --> 19:54.367
<i>If Asta goes out
with the Grey,</i>

19:54.367 --> 19:57.457
she can get information for me.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.720
I changed my mind.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.243
You can go on the date.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.550
You think
she needs your permission?

20:03.550 --> 20:05.029
You said it, sister.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.118
Yasss, queen.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.557
He was kind of cute.

20:10.557 --> 20:11.819
There's my girl.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.473
That's also my girl.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.604

20:29.010 --> 20:30.359
Hey, there.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.621
You must be John's parents.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.536
I'm Sheriff Mike Thompson
from Patience.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.972
I work with
your daughter-in-law.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.366
I'm meeting her and John
here to see the van.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.803
We don't have
a daughter-in-law or a van.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.762
Don't know a John.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.111
Huh.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.069
I could swear that
this was the right house.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.289
It's even got a brown barn
with white doors.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.769
Don't have a brown barn.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.075
Or white doors.

20:51.075 --> 20:54.383
The barn right there,
it's brown.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.211
I'm looking at it
with my own eyes.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.605
We don't have eyes.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.824
There's a lot of confusing
shit coming from over here.

21:00.824 --> 21:01.956
I'm going to be
honest with you.

21:03.174 --> 21:06.439
- Hey, it's Livy and John.
- Hey-hey.

21:06.439 --> 21:07.701
Hi.

21:07.701 --> 21:08.789
- How are you?
- Hello.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.138
Hey, John.

21:10.138 --> 21:12.314
- Hey, honey.
- You're just in time.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.490
- Hi, my boy.
- Hi, Fingers.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.187
Hey.

21:16.187 --> 21:19.234
We made a big batch
of jerky this time.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.454
You should take some home.
- Ooh.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.020
You said you didn't know them.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.153
Don't take it personally.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.676
They just don't
trust outsiders.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.983
It's a, you know,
fool-me-once kind of thing.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.246
Liv was really worried the
van might get you in trouble

21:31.246 --> 21:32.465
with the government.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.337
The U.S. government?

21:35.337 --> 21:37.383
I'm so scared.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.819
Yeah, tell them it's here.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.342
This is Ute land.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.823
They come here, I'll be slicing
off more than jerky, eh?

21:46.522 --> 21:47.958
Come on, my boy.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.743
Come help me.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.354
They're jokers.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.835
Hey, you started without me.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.359
- What do you think?
- It looks great, babe.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.841
Is that a fetus?

22:00.841 --> 22:02.277
Yes, it is.

22:02.277 --> 22:03.757
It's, uh, Max.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.629
You know, I kept having
this image in my head,

22:06.629 --> 22:09.719
and then I realized it
must be Max's ultrasound.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.330
It's cool, huh?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.116
Oh, god.
Uh, I don't--

22:15.116 --> 22:17.336
- Babe?
- I don't feel so good.

22:18.424 --> 22:19.729
Whew.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.166
Oh, what-- what, uh--

22:22.166 --> 22:24.386
what is that bracelet?

22:25.518 --> 22:26.736
Well, uh--

22:26.736 --> 22:30.479
I-- I just got it
at an antique market.

22:30.479 --> 22:33.003
Can you please not point
that mug at me?

22:33.003 --> 22:34.614
Oh, I feel sick.

22:40.228 --> 22:41.882
<i>Heroes work alone.</i>

22:41.882 --> 22:44.450
<i>The General may have provided
me with the equipment,</i>

22:44.450 --> 22:48.845
<i>but I am doing all the work,
so I am the real hero.</i>

22:48.845 --> 22:53.110
<i>Just like the most famous
alien hero, Superman.</i>

22:57.811 --> 22:59.378
What do you want?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.118
I need to talk to you.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.250
Keep him busy.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.947
I need to use your bathroom.

23:03.947 --> 23:05.732
Fine, but do not stink it up.

23:05.732 --> 23:08.125
I have not brushed
my teeth yet.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.302
You need to tell me what
happened to the Alien Tracker.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.087
Alien Tracker?

23:13.087 --> 23:17.570
Well, is an old guy,
kind of bald?

23:17.570 --> 23:20.616
I think his son
put him in a home.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.664
What are you doing over there?

23:24.664 --> 23:27.362
I thought you said you
needed to go to the bathroom.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.451
Just looking for a magazine.

23:29.451 --> 23:30.713
It might be a while.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.194
Harry, you need
to tell me the truth.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.414
Did you kill him
the night I sent him here?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.285
Of course I did not kill him.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.982
He did not even come here.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.506
I was very upset.

23:40.506 --> 23:45.119
I had to soothe myself
with some breezy music.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.251
Have you heard of yacht rock?

23:47.251 --> 23:49.123
OK, Max. Let's go.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.255
I did not hear a flush.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.866
It was a false alarm.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.912
But I did clean the toilet
with your toothbrush.

23:57.784 --> 24:00.961
Well, the joke is on you
because I will not

24:00.961 --> 24:02.963
pay you for your maid service!

24:08.708 --> 24:10.492
See? I told you.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.103
Harry said the Alien Tracker
never even came here.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.323
If the Alien Tracker
never came here,

24:15.323 --> 24:18.369
then how did I find this?

24:18.369 --> 24:19.762
Harry lied to me?

24:19.762 --> 24:22.417
Yes, because Harry
is a bad alien.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.245
I think it's time
we got some backup.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.855
I'll put out some
feelers to those kids

24:25.855 --> 24:28.031
at the comic book store.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.732
Pass me some more tape.

24:35.386 --> 24:38.128
What you doing
with all these sponges?

24:38.128 --> 24:39.652
I didn't want
to raise red flags

24:39.652 --> 24:41.610
using department resources,
so I bought

24:41.610 --> 24:43.264
the fingerprint kit online.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.092
And the scrubber is
for my cast-iron skillet.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.398
Wait, wait, you wash
your cast-iron skillet?

24:47.398 --> 24:48.791
You can't do that.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.054
Where do you think
the food's flavor come from?

24:51.054 --> 24:52.142
The food?

24:52.142 --> 24:53.666
The skillet.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.755
What you think got more flavor,
the food you're cooking,

24:55.755 --> 24:59.062
or 10 years of food
cooked on iron?

24:59.062 --> 25:01.935
I don't know, but now
my stomach feels weird.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.502
Shit.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.547
Scrubbing a cast-iron
skillet, that's like--

25:05.547 --> 25:07.854
that's like washing your hands
before you eat a sandwich.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.464
Half of what you taste
on the sandwiches,

25:09.464 --> 25:11.292
that's-- that's finger flavor.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.033
Wait.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.904
Is this--

25:14.904 --> 25:16.515
Yeah.

25:16.515 --> 25:20.301
That right there
is a fingerprint.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.259
Good job, Deputy.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.306
Hi.

25:25.306 --> 25:29.571
I'm excited for your date,
so I bought you a present.

25:29.571 --> 25:32.443
It's a makeup container.

25:32.443 --> 25:35.359
You can put powder on your
nose and on your cheeks.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.406
<i>It's also a listening device,
so I can spy on your date.</i>

25:38.406 --> 25:40.626
Thank you.
That's sweet.

25:40.626 --> 25:44.238
Um, I'm just not really
the nose-powdering type.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.283
You should be.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.590
Your face is sweaty.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.244
That's less sweet.

25:50.244 --> 25:53.290
Take it with you on your date
with Joseph, and ask him lots

25:53.290 --> 25:55.379
of questions about himself.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.642
Human men like that.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.818
I know how to go on a date.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.471
Do you?

26:00.471 --> 26:02.691
I-- I am an alien.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.432
I have been on more
dates than you.

26:04.432 --> 26:07.087
Good luck.

26:24.147 --> 26:27.498
I'll be honest,
I'm surprised you asked me out.

26:27.498 --> 26:30.371
Well, I'll be honest,
I was surprised, too.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.460
I haven't been
on a date in a while.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.418
I mean, I could have, probably.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.985
But I've been busy at work,

26:35.985 --> 26:37.813
also reconnecting
with my daughter,

26:37.813 --> 26:39.510
which is a whole story.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.860
I like to read at night.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.078
I am nervous.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.602
Maybe if I just
drink this beer,

26:43.602 --> 26:44.646
my mouth will stop talking.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.083
I'm also divorced.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.824
I like that you're nervous.

26:48.824 --> 26:51.044
It means I'm not the only one.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.828
I don't date much either.

26:52.828 --> 26:55.004
Oh, yeah?

26:55.004 --> 26:56.702
Why not?

26:56.702 --> 26:59.313
I move around a lot.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.315
I always have,
since I was young.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.404
Never stayed in one place for
more than a couple of months.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.014
Mm, that's hard.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.365
I grew up here,
but I left for a while.

27:08.365 --> 27:11.107
And when I came back,
it sort of felt like I left

27:11.107 --> 27:13.022
half of myself somewhere else.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.633
Well, I'm glad
I met this half.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.286
Uh, or no.

27:16.286 --> 27:21.030
Actually, like, I'm still that
person, but two people in one.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.467
I don't know.
- No.

27:23.467 --> 27:28.255
Two people in one,
but sometimes only half.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.605
That's kind of
a perfect way to put it.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.610
High school was
in New Hampshire.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.003
I grew up on a lake.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.439
My mother was
a hairdresser named Marlene,

27:38.439 --> 27:41.224
and my father was
a small-town doctor.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.662
Kind of like your
Harry Vanderspeigle.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.794
Oh, Harry.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.056
One of a kind.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.710
Tell me about him.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.233
Oh.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.496
Come on, I haven't even
finished my first drink yet.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.411
You don't really expect me
to talk about work.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.935
Oh.

27:55.935 --> 27:57.545
Don't worry,
I won't ask you about Harry

27:57.545 --> 27:59.678
again until drink number two.

28:04.465 --> 28:07.076
<i>My alliance with
the General is working well.</i>

28:07.076 --> 28:09.165
<i>Having her deliver
military surveillance</i>

28:09.165 --> 28:12.168
<i>equipment to my house is
easier than buying it online.</i>

28:12.168 --> 28:14.431
<i>I did not even have
to pay for shipping.</i>

28:14.431 --> 28:17.173
<i>D'arcy doesn't
know we're here, OK?</i>

28:17.173 --> 28:19.088
<i>So you have to promise
not to say anything.</i>

28:19.088 --> 28:21.047
What the hell is this?

28:21.047 --> 28:23.092
I know you'll keep
your widdle mouth shut,

28:23.092 --> 28:24.833
because you're
not a tattletale.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.400
No, you're not.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.924
You have a tail, but that's
just a skin tail, OK?

28:28.924 --> 28:32.275
So time to get
your nubs in the tubs.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.625
<i>Asta left
her makeup at home.</i>

28:45.245 --> 28:48.291
♪ Oh, Kevin boy ♪

28:48.291 --> 28:54.036
♪ Your skin is
pink and stretchy ♪

28:54.036 --> 28:59.738
♪ From ear to ear
and down to your backside ♪

29:01.174 --> 29:03.393
♪ You have no hair

29:03.393 --> 29:08.572
♪ And look like a raw chicken

29:08.572 --> 29:11.401
♪ It's true, it's true

29:11.401 --> 29:17.016
♪ Your skin is soft rawhide

29:17.886 --> 29:19.496
Oh.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.195
Well, hello, sailor.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.457
Hi.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.720
You want to get out?

29:27.113 --> 29:30.899
He gets so
self-conscious about his body.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.163
What are you doing here?

29:34.163 --> 29:38.037
Oh, I'm just, you know,
making a little Judy soup.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.952
You want to taste it?

29:39.952 --> 29:41.649
Make sure it's ready?

29:41.649 --> 29:43.477
Oh, oh, no.

29:43.477 --> 29:47.002
Oh, my body's
rising to the top.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.352
Please stop.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.528
Oh, fine.

29:51.528 --> 29:54.488
Maybe we can just
keep this between us

29:54.488 --> 29:56.969
because Asta and D'arcy
don't totally

29:56.969 --> 29:59.014
know that I use their bathtub.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.494
Mine's full of dirty dishes.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.496
I will keep it a secret,
if you keep it a secret

30:02.496 --> 30:03.584
that I was here.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.934
Oh, my lips are sealed.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.538
God, JuJu, you scared me.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.018
What are you doing here?

30:46.018 --> 30:47.715
Uh, Kevin really wanted
to see your new place, so--

30:47.715 --> 30:49.064
Oh, OK.
Yeah, sure.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.892
OK, OK.
That's OK, baby.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.895
You can go see the bedroom.

30:53.895 --> 30:58.900
And while we were here,
we just decided to take a bath.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.815
- Gotta.
- It's working really well.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.513
If someone mentioned
to you that I was here,

31:03.513 --> 31:06.690
then that just means
that I am way better

31:06.690 --> 31:08.779
at keeping secrets than he is.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.956
Wait, someone else was here?

31:10.956 --> 31:12.609
<i>The human bladder is</i>

31:12.609 --> 31:15.438
<i>not considered full until
it holds two cups of liquid.</i>

31:15.438 --> 31:19.573
<i>Or in this case, that local
beer Joseph is drinking.</i>

31:22.402 --> 31:24.534
<i>That was faster than expected.</i>

31:24.534 --> 31:27.711
<i>Maybe because that local beer
is already like urine.</i>

31:31.280 --> 31:33.282
Hello, Asta, my friend.
- Mm.

31:33.282 --> 31:34.631
What are you doing here?

31:34.631 --> 31:37.808
I forgot to give
you your good luck

31:37.808 --> 31:39.985
hug before your date.

31:39.985 --> 31:43.336
Oh, good luck to you.

31:43.336 --> 31:44.424
OK.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.034
That's sweet,
but you can go now.

31:46.034 --> 31:46.992
Some French fries.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.210
Harry.

31:57.654 --> 31:58.829
- Oh.
- Hi, Mrs. Hawthorne.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.440
- Hi.
- Is Max around?

32:00.440 --> 32:02.572
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

32:02.572 --> 32:06.533
Max, Sahar is here.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.100
OK.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.711
I am going to go
pick up dinner.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.627
Oh, Sahar,
you want to eat with us?

32:13.627 --> 32:14.976
No, thanks.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.673
I don't eat takeout,
because the packaging is

32:16.673 --> 32:18.327
slowly destroying the Earth.

32:18.327 --> 32:20.242
It's OK to just say no.

32:24.072 --> 32:25.508
Where were you?

32:25.508 --> 32:27.336
You were supposed to meet me
at the comic book store

32:27.336 --> 32:29.034
so we could find some recruits.

32:29.034 --> 32:32.037
I told you, I don't want
to be friends with those kids.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.169
Our group is fine
with just the two of us.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.824
Two isn't a group.
It's a couple.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.782
I thought two was a few.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.481
- Why would you think that?
- It rhymes.

32:41.481 --> 32:46.312
Look, more people is better
because, like, you never know

32:46.312 --> 32:47.966
when you might lose someone.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.793
Who are we going to lose?

32:52.013 --> 32:54.015
Me.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.843
What?

32:55.843 --> 32:57.540
I'm going away, Max.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.672
To jail?

32:58.672 --> 32:59.934
What?

32:59.934 --> 33:01.327
No.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.546
I tested into
a prestigious academic program

33:03.546 --> 33:06.375
for gifted children
in California.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.813
But you can't move away.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.250
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.165
I just thought if you
had some new friends

33:13.165 --> 33:16.777
to hang around with,
you wouldn't care if I left.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.866
Of course I care.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.650
You're the only real friend
I ever had that didn't

33:20.650 --> 33:22.391
make me feel like I'm a freak.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.089
You're not a freak.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.481
You're special.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.266
Now that
the Alien Tracker is gone,

33:27.266 --> 33:29.833
you're the only one
who can identify aliens.

33:29.833 --> 33:32.097
You know what
a unique gift that is?

33:32.097 --> 33:33.707
Wait.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.752
Are you saying
I'm the new Alien Tracker?

33:35.752 --> 33:37.406
That I'm all-powerful?

33:37.406 --> 33:38.581
What?

33:38.581 --> 33:39.930
No, not exactly--

33:39.930 --> 33:42.063
Is it possible only the true

33:42.063 --> 33:45.240
Alien Tracker
can lift the taser?

33:45.240 --> 33:47.590
Well, I actually carried
it out of Harry's house--

33:47.590 --> 33:48.939
I am the one.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.985
I am the Alien Tracker.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.901
I am he, and him is I.

33:55.598 --> 33:59.080
Yeah, Earth is in good hands.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.560
Hey, Dan.
Is my order ready?

34:00.560 --> 34:03.084
Give me one minute.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.912
Oh, hi, Kayla.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.827
Hi, Rachel.
- Mm.

34:06.827 --> 34:07.915
How's it going?

34:07.915 --> 34:09.264
Oh, I'm good.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.049
I was just
grabbing some takeout.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.182
- Come sit.
- Oh, thanks.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.576
Oh, you know, I am--

34:16.576 --> 34:19.231
I'm not getting a lot
of sleep, thanks to the owl

34:19.231 --> 34:22.277
outside my window that's
keeping me awake at night.

34:22.277 --> 34:24.671
You have an owl
outside your house?

34:24.671 --> 34:26.586
Yeah.

34:26.586 --> 34:28.588
Why?

34:28.588 --> 34:30.981
Well, it's just,
for our people

34:30.981 --> 34:33.071
owls are a little taboo.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.289
They're messengers of death.

34:34.289 --> 34:35.508
What?

34:35.508 --> 34:36.900
OK, it's more
like a metaphor.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.380
You're going to be fine.
And come on.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.773
We're in Colorado.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.992
There's going to be owls
flying all over the place.

34:41.992 --> 34:43.559
Well, the owl isn't flying.

34:43.559 --> 34:47.694
It just sits outside
my window and stares at me.

34:48.912 --> 34:50.436
Here you go, Kate.

34:50.436 --> 34:54.004
Three burgers,
one extra well-done for Ben.

34:54.004 --> 34:57.269
Hope he
enjoys his shoe leather.

35:01.011 --> 35:02.491
What's going on?

35:02.491 --> 35:04.145
Something wrong with the food?

35:04.145 --> 35:07.583
Kate has an owl sitting
outside of her window.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.716
It just stares at her.

35:12.153 --> 35:15.069
Take this cedar,
Kate, and burn it

35:15.069 --> 35:16.853
in every room in your house.

35:16.853 --> 35:19.247
But don't use a lighter,
use a match.

35:19.247 --> 35:20.379
Oh, my god.

35:20.379 --> 35:23.338
Usually we use sage
or sweetgrass.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.731
But this is stronger.

35:24.731 --> 35:28.126
It'll offer you more
protection, which you need.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.866
Just burn the cedar, OK?

35:29.866 --> 35:31.303
You're going to be fine.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.479
Wait, would you come over
to the house and help me?

35:33.479 --> 35:35.872
No, no, no, no, no, no.

35:35.872 --> 35:38.092
Dan, would you--

35:40.094 --> 35:41.443
<i>Are you sure
you don't want any dessert,</i>

35:41.443 --> 35:42.749
<i>or another drink, maybe?</i>

35:42.749 --> 35:45.012
<i>No, thank you.
But you know--</i>

35:45.012 --> 35:47.145
Do I need to put up
no trespassing signs?

35:47.145 --> 35:48.711
You have three
seconds to tell me

35:48.711 --> 35:50.017
why you're listening
to Asta's date,

35:50.017 --> 35:51.888
or I'm going
to smash this shit.

35:51.888 --> 35:53.151
I do not care.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.370
If you break it, you buy it.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.639
That is way more pieces
than I would have guessed.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.989
You are so stupid!

36:05.989 --> 36:09.471
Now the world will end,
and it will be your fault.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.081
What the hell are
you talking about?

36:11.081 --> 36:13.562
Joseph is a Grey alien.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.129
What?

36:15.129 --> 36:16.957
And you let Asta
go out with him?

36:16.957 --> 36:19.438
I needed to figure
out what the Grey

36:19.438 --> 36:21.744
aliens were doing here.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.529
Oh, by risking Asta's life?

36:23.529 --> 36:27.881
I was keeping Asta safe
by listening to the date,

36:27.881 --> 36:31.145
but you broke the radio.

36:31.145 --> 36:32.799
How could you do that to Asta?

36:32.799 --> 36:34.235
You're a bad friend.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.628
Pick up.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.412
Pick up, goddamn it.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.109
Do not worry.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.937
He will not hurt her
when they are in public.

36:40.937 --> 36:44.811
Well, they left Laurent's.

36:44.811 --> 36:45.986
All right.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.770
They're headed
to our apartment.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.207
You are tracking Asta?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.034
You are doing what I was doing.

36:51.034 --> 36:53.298
It's only creepy
if you do it.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.431
Can I get a ride with you?

36:56.431 --> 36:58.216
Uh, no.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.262
Yeah, it was kind
of our special thing.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.699
When me and Dad went
fishing, I don't know,

37:03.699 --> 37:07.268
it was like the rest
of the world didn't exist.

37:10.532 --> 37:13.622
What about your mother?

37:13.622 --> 37:18.975
Um, she wasn't around.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.676
- Oh.
- Hey.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.678
Oh, are you OK?

37:25.678 --> 37:26.722
Uh, no.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.289
No, I--

37:29.595 --> 37:32.467
I had a gnarly fish sandwich,
so I'm sick.

37:32.467 --> 37:36.515
I should be alone with Asta.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.733
Oh.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.953
OK, I'm here.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.520
Everything's going to be OK.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.478
Oh, yeah.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.653
Well, yeah.

37:44.653 --> 37:46.873
Well, I should probably go.
Thank you.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.309
I'm sorry.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.006
Thank you
for a lovely evening, and--

37:51.486 --> 37:52.705
Maybe we could
do it again sometime.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.185
All right. OK.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.187
All right.
I need to tell you something.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.885
Wait, that was an act?

37:58.885 --> 38:01.191
- I had to get rid of him.
- Why?

38:01.191 --> 38:02.889
You're the one that wanted me
to go on this date.

38:02.889 --> 38:05.021
You made me buy new underwear.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.197
You should sit down.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.374
And, uh, maybe start
drinking that wine.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.897
- Uh--
- From the bottle.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.333
Now you're scaring me.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.248
What's going on?

38:14.248 --> 38:15.597
Harry.

38:19.035 --> 38:20.341
What is Harry doing here?

38:20.341 --> 38:23.518
Yes, Harry,
what are you doing here?

38:24.867 --> 38:30.438
Joseph is a Grey alien
here to destroy the planet.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.570
What?

38:33.485 --> 38:36.923
And you let me go
on a date with him?

38:36.923 --> 38:42.015
Also, Judy Pooper used your
bathtub without permission.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.104
Can you believe her?

38:51.938 --> 38:56.072
I think I would feel better
if someone said something.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.684
Such a bad alien.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.382
You're bad!
- No, don't hit him with that.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.036
Fine.

39:03.036 --> 39:04.385
Now that you
know who Harry is,

39:04.385 --> 39:05.691
you should also
know that he's not

39:05.691 --> 39:07.257
emotionally evolved
enough to distinguish

39:07.257 --> 39:08.476
between right and wrong.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.391
He's basically a child.
- Just a child.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.133
- He doesn't get it.
- I don't get it.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.656
But I still want to hit him.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.877
I only did it because I
was trying to save the Earth.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.879
OK, but we talked
about this before.

39:19.879 --> 39:23.230
You don't do that to someone
that you care about.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.102
I also care about the Earth.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.540
I had no choice.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.933
Please, Harry, just go.

39:45.252 --> 39:49.125
You know, I'm more mad
at myself than Harry.

39:49.125 --> 39:52.302
What is wrong with me?

39:52.302 --> 39:54.566
I finally feel like going
on a date for the first time

39:54.566 --> 39:56.263
since Jimmy, and what do I do?

39:56.263 --> 39:58.570
I choose the asshole again.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.267
You can't blame yourself.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.661
Come on.

40:02.661 --> 40:04.793
No, it's just bad luck.

40:04.793 --> 40:06.969
You can't-- you can't give up.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.366
"Had fun.

40:12.366 --> 40:15.761
You looked very pretty tonight.
Can I see you again?"

40:15.761 --> 40:17.589
Aw.
- Aw, that's kind of sweet--no.

40:17.589 --> 40:20.896
- What the hell?
- You should give up.

40:25.771 --> 40:28.469
<i>I used to prefer
working alone.</i>

40:30.645 --> 40:34.170
<i>But as a human,
you're never really alone.</i>

40:34.170 --> 40:36.738
OK.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.654
- Night.
- Night.

40:39.654 --> 40:43.092
<i>Every decision
you make affects other people.</i>

40:43.092 --> 40:45.617
<i>♪ When it could be nicer</i>

40:45.617 --> 40:50.926

40:58.543 --> 41:00.806
<i>♪ It's not, it's not</i>

41:00.806 --> 41:02.198
<i>Maybe that's why humans</i>

41:02.198 --> 41:04.549
<i>struggle with difficult
decisions all the time.</i>

41:06.376 --> 41:09.728
<i>♪ You seem to blend

41:09.728 --> 41:12.165
<i>♪ Ordinary, everyday</i>

41:12.165 --> 41:15.342
<i>Some are small

41:16.648 --> 41:18.824
I think we should
sell the house.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.653
<i>♪ Standing out like
sparkles in the water ♪</i>

41:21.653 --> 41:25.134
<i>Other decisions are so big
they affect the entire planet.</i>

41:25.134 --> 41:28.224
<i>I knew what I was doing when
I told Asta to date Joseph.</i>

41:28.224 --> 41:30.705
<i>I was making the decision
that the Earth is more</i>

41:30.705 --> 41:32.881
<i>important than any one person.</i>

41:32.881 --> 41:35.057
<i>But what if that
one person feels</i>

41:35.057 --> 41:37.190
<i>more important than anything?</i>

41:37.190 --> 41:39.409
<i>What if you love them
so much, you will choose</i>

41:39.409 --> 41:41.673
<i>what is best for them
over what is best</i>

41:41.673 --> 41:43.936
<i>for an entire planet?</i>

41:43.936 --> 41:48.375
<i>If I am a superhero,
Asta is my kryptonite.</i>

41:51.944 --> 41:53.728
Harry?

41:54.729 --> 41:57.253
Harry, you scared me.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.998
What are you doing here?

42:04.347 --> 42:05.871
Are you crying?

42:05.871 --> 42:09.178
I came in here to kill you.

42:09.178 --> 42:10.353
What's that now?

42:10.353 --> 42:12.791
Oh, do not worry.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.967
I could not do it.

42:14.967 --> 42:20.625
And even if I did, your murder
would be gentle, painless.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.888
OK.

42:22.888 --> 42:25.412
Well, that's good to know.

42:25.412 --> 42:27.240
Asta, what should I do?

42:27.240 --> 42:29.634
I could have gotten
information from Joseph,

42:29.634 --> 42:33.899
information that would
help me save the planet.

42:35.030 --> 42:38.164
But I had to stop
because of you.

42:38.164 --> 42:42.429
I will always have
to stop because of you.

42:42.429 --> 42:43.952
I don't understand.

42:43.952 --> 42:46.128
I care about you too much.

42:47.913 --> 42:52.091
If I could just kill you,
I could save the world.

42:52.091 --> 42:55.050
But if I save you,
then the world dies

42:55.050 --> 42:58.401
and you die with it,
so why can I not just kill you?

42:58.401 --> 43:02.101
Oh, Harry.

43:02.101 --> 43:03.319
Oh, Har--

43:03.319 --> 43:04.712
You're afraid of me now.

43:04.712 --> 43:06.845
No, I know you
would never kill me.

43:09.630 --> 43:11.197
And I'm going to help you.

43:11.197 --> 43:13.852
I will not let you
fail your mission.

43:13.852 --> 43:15.767
You'll kill yourself?

43:15.767 --> 43:17.943
You are such a good friend!

43:17.943 --> 43:20.641
- Oh.
- You're a good friend.

43:20.641 --> 43:22.251
No.

43:22.251 --> 43:23.775
Do you know what one
of the best things

43:23.775 --> 43:25.211
is about being human?

43:25.211 --> 43:26.691
The colon.

43:26.691 --> 43:27.953
Choice.

43:27.953 --> 43:30.738
We choose what we do, OK?

43:30.738 --> 43:33.349
I'm going to go on
another date with Joseph.

43:33.349 --> 43:35.003
No, you cannot do that.

43:35.003 --> 43:37.789
The Grey aliens
are very dangerous.

43:37.789 --> 43:40.356
I know.
But I choose to go.

43:40.356 --> 43:43.925
And-- and this time, you won't
have to hide a mic in my bag.

43:43.925 --> 43:45.535
I'll find out what
you need to know.

43:45.535 --> 43:48.277
You and I are going
to save Earth together.

43:48.277 --> 43:50.323
<i>The problem
with working as a team</i>

43:50.323 --> 43:52.847
<i>is sometimes other
people can hold you back.</i>

43:52.847 --> 43:55.807
<i>But all the best
superheroes have sidekicks.</i>

43:55.807 --> 43:58.679
<i>Even Superman has Lois Lane.</i>

44:00.028 --> 44:02.640
