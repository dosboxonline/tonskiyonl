00:02.437 --> 00:04.265
<i>Previously on "Resident Alien"...</i>

00:04.265 --> 00:06.136
Get in!

00:06.136 --> 00:07.442
Maybe he's not dead.
- What?

00:07.442 --> 00:09.270
We have to go back and see.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.967
<i>Joseph is an alien.</i>

00:10.967 --> 00:12.099
They're real.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.274
<i>They abduct people,</i>

00:13.274 --> 00:14.840
<i>and they don't remember.</i>

00:14.840 --> 00:15.972
No!

00:15.972 --> 00:18.061
At least let me remember
this time.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.845
- Ah!
<i>- Richard is back,</i>

00:19.845 --> 00:21.151
<i>and he is murder-y.</i>

00:22.239 --> 00:23.806
<i>I love him.</i>

00:24.589 --> 00:27.157
<i>I gave the ball to Robert,
but the Greys kidnapped him.</i>

00:27.157 --> 00:31.074
<i>And their stupid, beautiful
hybrids have it and my DNA.</i>

00:31.074 --> 00:32.597
<i>They can speed up
their plans</i>

00:32.597 --> 00:34.164
<i>for the cavern at Yellowstone.</i>

00:34.164 --> 00:35.426
<i>I am building a bomb</i>

00:35.426 --> 00:37.515
<i>that can destroy
the Greys' spaceship.</i>

00:37.515 --> 00:40.344
<i>Some son of a bitch
stole my bomb.</i>

02:20.183 --> 02:22.794
- Who would steal the bomb?
- Joseph.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.754
He must have slipped in
while I was sleeping.

02:25.754 --> 02:29.323
Handsome people, they think
they can just do anything.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.977
So the Greys have your DNA
and the ball.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.153
Mm.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.328
They could blow up
Yellowstone

02:34.328 --> 02:36.199
and destroy the Earth
any minute.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.635
- Yeah.
- And if I send my forces in,

02:37.635 --> 02:39.594
the Greys will just
freeze them?

02:39.594 --> 02:41.030
Yeah.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.205
That's it.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.859
It's over. I--

02:43.859 --> 02:46.078
I can't stop them.

02:46.078 --> 02:48.994
Has anyone seen my tablet?

02:48.994 --> 02:50.561
Oh, there it is.

02:50.561 --> 02:53.956
Bridget, you have had
enough screen time, okay?

02:55.610 --> 02:57.177
It's... me.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.830
No, no, no,
this is my son.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.530
He is young, and he is still
experimenting with his look.

03:05.054 --> 03:08.013
- Okay, terrible twos.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.101
Don't slam it, you--

03:10.581 --> 03:13.280
If your alien ship
didn't fly over that night,

03:13.280 --> 03:15.760
my father would still be alive.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.937
I spent my entire life
looking for aliens

03:18.937 --> 03:22.811
so that I can kill them all
and rid this Earth

03:22.811 --> 03:24.900
of all you monsters.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.859
This is my safe space.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.122
I'm feeling not safe.

03:30.122 --> 03:33.125
You know what I mean.
You're one of the good ones.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.172
One of the good ones?

03:36.172 --> 03:38.261
I caught you in a racism.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.393
It's too late.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.046
It's really over.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.613
No, it is not.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.398
I just need to get my bomb back

03:44.398 --> 03:46.051
and blow up
the Greys' spaceship.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.531
I have to find Joseph.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.446
It may take a little time.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.274
He travels by portal.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.842
What?

03:53.842 --> 03:54.930
What portal?

03:54.930 --> 03:57.367
The portal--portals.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.326
The Greys, it's how they get

03:59.326 --> 04:01.676
from place to place
and jump timelines.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.286
It's the same technology I used

04:03.286 --> 04:06.376
to go back in time
to become Goliath.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.856
I explained all of this to you.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.032
Sometimes I think
you do not listen to me.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.556
You know, my words matter.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.302
Don't worry.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.000
I'll find Joseph.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.743
<i>Humans spend most of their
lives searching for something.</i>

04:25.743 --> 04:29.530
<i>Some days, it's a Grey hybrid
alien who stole your bomb.</i>

04:29.530 --> 04:32.620
<i>The next day, it's car keys.</i>

04:32.620 --> 04:34.143
<i>And some days,
what they're searching for</i>

04:34.143 --> 04:35.927
<i>is the strength
to tell someone they love</i>

04:35.927 --> 04:38.060
<i>that their world
is falling apart.</i>

04:38.060 --> 04:40.149
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.464
- I need to tell you--
- I need to tell you something.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.118
Sorry.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.859
No, you go.

05:00.474 --> 05:04.521
You ever have
something so crazy happen

05:04.521 --> 05:06.828
that you have no idea
what to do?

05:08.395 --> 05:09.657
Yeah.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.313
Yeah, I have.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.966
Hey.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.055
I may only have time
to do a few more of these.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.404
I'm finally here.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.884
I can see the Grey hybrids.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.192
Oh, they really are so hot,
it's scary.

06:07.192 --> 06:11.545
Maybe I'm... just scared.

06:11.545 --> 06:15.505
Look, I always thought
I was put here to ski,

06:15.505 --> 06:18.508
but maybe it's this.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.597
It's kind of like
avalanche control--

06:20.597 --> 06:23.513
make an explosion
to prevent a disaster.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.386
Same, except on the mountain,

06:26.386 --> 06:30.302
there's not much chance that
I'm gonna blow myself up too.

06:30.302 --> 06:33.697
But hey,
if I die saving everyone,

06:33.697 --> 06:36.831
at least I'll know
I was here for a reason.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.355
And I know you'll
all be proud of me.

06:39.355 --> 06:42.663
Not pushing this, but...

06:42.663 --> 06:44.186
big bronze statue
of me on a horse

06:44.186 --> 06:46.449
might be a nice tribute.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.711
It was D'arcy.

06:47.711 --> 06:48.886
She would not steal a bomb.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.366
There is not even
any vodka in it.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.847
Elliot said
that she came to his house

06:52.847 --> 06:54.718
and said she was gonna do
something big

06:54.718 --> 06:56.590
so that people
would be proud of her.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.895
This must be it.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.462
We have to find her.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.552
It was not her.
It was Joseph.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.033
He stole the bomb!

07:05.033 --> 07:06.382
What bomb?

07:06.382 --> 07:07.775
Never mind.
It was her.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.473
What the hell
are you doing here?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.562
Why, do you want
to drug me again?

07:12.562 --> 07:13.607
You want to be
a dickhead again?

07:13.607 --> 07:16.044
Yeah, I do.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.525
Well, I don't, actually.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.265
Tell me what this formula does.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.921
And if you say anything
about ice cream,

07:23.921 --> 07:25.619
I'll know you might be lying.

07:25.619 --> 07:30.058
This formula allows the Greys
to make the Earth uninhabitable

07:30.058 --> 07:33.453
for everything
except their species.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.280
So not humans?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.282
No.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.588
And not half-humans?

07:38.588 --> 07:40.155
Yeah, no.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.723
Wait, you didn't even know
what your own plan was?

07:42.723 --> 07:45.116
I knew something was up.

07:45.116 --> 07:48.293
They were acting weird
and wouldn't make eye contact.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.165
Every time they would,
they would smile too big.

07:50.165 --> 07:53.298
Like when everyone is invited
to a party except you.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.562
Oh, God, I thought you didn't
want to go to Kayla's birthday.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.651
Of course I want to go
to Kalayla's birthday.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.348
It's Kayla. I've told you
that so many times.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.045
- Kaylala.
- Will you drop it?

08:01.045 --> 08:02.786
I can't believe
they were gonna let me die.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.962
After everything
I've done for them.

08:04.962 --> 08:07.312
I haven't had a day off
in seven years.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.706
That is horrible.

08:09.706 --> 08:12.492
Even Septids get
two weeks off a year.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.623
It isn't just the vacations.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.320
The per diem is shit.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.149
We have the worst health plan.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.890
You know, when I got in a fight
with a Lepticon last year,

08:19.890 --> 08:21.936
cut my hand, I was
out of pocket for the stitches.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.633
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.069
Had you met your deductible?

08:25.069 --> 08:28.464
Can we please stop talking
about health care, okay?

08:28.464 --> 08:29.639
D'arcy is in danger.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.249
The world could end
any day now.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.990
Today, actually.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.992
- Today?
- They gave your ball to Frank

08:34.992 --> 08:36.777
and told him to fill
the chamber at Yellowstone

08:36.777 --> 08:38.169
with water.
- Oh, my God.

08:38.169 --> 08:43.523
We can help you defeat
this son of a bitch Frank.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.177
- How?
- I built a bomb.

08:46.177 --> 08:49.441
And her clown-haired friend,
she stole it.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.356
With the--
the stupid-looking--

08:51.356 --> 08:52.749
Oh, stop it. God.

08:52.749 --> 08:53.968
She's headed to Yellowstone

08:53.968 --> 08:56.405
because she's gonna do
something stupid.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.276
But if you could help us
find her,

08:58.276 --> 09:00.235
then we could use the bomb
and stop them.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.497
It may be too late.

09:01.497 --> 09:04.413
We have to try.
Joseph, please.

09:04.413 --> 09:08.112
Look, I--I know that there is
a human part of you that cares.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.810
I saw it the night
that we went out--

09:09.810 --> 09:11.855
you know, before you threatened
to kill me.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.292
- Oh.
- This planet, it's your home.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.599
It's life.
It matters.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.340
Harry gets it.
Tell him, Harry.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.430
If you help us,

09:21.430 --> 09:23.127
Asta will date you again.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.129
Or we could just focus
on the planet part.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.478
- She's playing hard to get.
- Oh--

09:26.478 --> 09:28.350
You'll get there.
Come on.

09:28.350 --> 09:31.396
I'm not gonna die
for these bastards.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.963
Let's date.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.225
Do it.
Let's do it.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.662
- Yes.
- And you should definitely

09:35.662 --> 09:37.707
send in that receipt
for the stitches.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.230
It's too late.
You only have a year.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.581
Backdate it.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.104
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.540
I'll let you guys
work this out.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.324
- They would never--
- Never know.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.345
Fine.
Aliens are abducting us?

10:07.345 --> 10:08.477
So what?

10:08.477 --> 10:09.870
You know, maybe this is good.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.786
Good? They've been
kidnapping you for 30 years.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.048
It's better to know,
you know?

10:14.048 --> 10:15.310
We can make a plan,
get our daughter back.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.398
We don't need to go crazy.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.660
You know, we can
be smart about it.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.662
First things first.
- What are you doing?

10:19.662 --> 10:21.621
Covering the house
in tinfoil.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.623
We need help.
We need to,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.668
I don't know,
call the Pentagon or something.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.496
Oh, no.
We can call your Uncle Jim.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.671
He works at the State House.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.194
- He's a custodian.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.674
What are you guys doing?

10:33.197 --> 10:37.288
Oh, God.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.116
What?

10:39.116 --> 10:41.162
Nothing.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.380
I was--I was praying.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.730
- Yep.
- Oh, God.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.731
Okay?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.297
Ben, can you come
and help me pray

10:46.297 --> 10:48.648
in--in the closet?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.522
What if they're abducting Max?

10:53.522 --> 10:55.045
Oh, God,
do you think they are?

10:55.045 --> 10:57.047
If they're taking both of us,
maybe he has a chip too.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.006
- Oh, no.
- We've got to find a way to--

10:59.006 --> 11:00.660
to check him
without him finding out.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.792
Yeah, okay,
I think there's a--

11:02.792 --> 11:04.489
there's a metal detector
in here somewhere.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.275
- Oh.
- God, what is that smell?

11:07.275 --> 11:08.537
You--you've been getting

11:08.537 --> 11:10.582
some candle returns
from your Etsy shop.

11:10.582 --> 11:13.847
I di--I didn't know
where else to put them.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.065
Hurtful.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.376
What is that?

11:21.376 --> 11:23.378
What's going on?

11:23.378 --> 11:27.077
<i>♪ Can't seem to get
my mind off of you ♪</i>

11:29.906 --> 11:35.216
<i>♪ Back here at home,
there's nothing to do ♪</i>

11:35.216 --> 11:38.741
<i>♪ Vacation,

11:38.741 --> 11:41.613
<i>♪ Vacation, had to get away</i>

11:41.613 --> 11:45.400

11:53.887 --> 11:57.586

12:02.156 --> 12:05.028
Okay, I made it this far.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.856
Only thing left to do is wait
for the portal to open

12:06.856 --> 12:08.771
and then, I guess,
step onto a spaceship.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.207
Very normal thing to say.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.515
Also, I might be insane.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.169
So this will be my last video.

12:15.169 --> 12:19.695
The most important thing
is that I, D'arcy Blue,

12:19.695 --> 12:22.437
can single-handedly
save the world.

12:22.437 --> 12:25.179
And I can't stress this enough.

12:25.179 --> 12:29.661
It is a small A after the D,
not a capital one.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.534
Okay, so it's capital D,
apostrophe--

12:35.929 --> 12:38.192
<i>♪ Vacation,
have to get away ♪</i>

12:38.192 --> 12:42.936
<i>♪ Vacation,
meant to be spent alone ♪</i>

12:44.285 --> 12:46.200
Holy shit.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.814
So how you doing, sweetie?
Huh?

12:51.814 --> 12:54.208
You--you having a good day?

12:54.208 --> 12:55.949
Yeah?
Oh, I missed you.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.037
Give Mommy a hug.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.995
Okay.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.781
Hey, buddy.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.217
What do you say we do
some detector-ing?

13:03.217 --> 13:05.175
Maybe hit the old-person beach
at the lake again?

13:05.175 --> 13:06.263
Yeah.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.743
Why are you guys
being so weird?

13:07.743 --> 13:11.312
Well, the truth is...

13:13.488 --> 13:14.924
The school called, and--

13:14.924 --> 13:16.447
and someone
in your class has lice.

13:16.447 --> 13:18.319
So we--we got
to check you out.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.537
I can't have lice.

13:19.537 --> 13:20.974
That's how people
get nicknames.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.150
We still call Will Hawley
"Billy Bugs."

13:23.150 --> 13:24.673
I would have gone
with "Crawly Hawley," but--

13:24.673 --> 13:26.327
Yeah, come on.
Let's go to the bathroom.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.155
I'll--I'll check you out.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.985
Sir--

13:31.985 --> 13:33.334
Look, I don't want to hear
searching this woods

13:33.334 --> 13:35.858
is a waste of time
because Joseph is some alien

13:35.858 --> 13:37.686
who was beamed up
onto his spaceship, okay?

13:37.686 --> 13:39.166
So if that's what
you're gonna say,

13:39.166 --> 13:41.081
I'd rather you just
tell me that, you know,

13:41.081 --> 13:43.692
you think my--my soap makes me
smell like a fresh houseplant

13:43.692 --> 13:45.520
or--or you're impressed
with the musculature

13:45.520 --> 13:47.870
of Cletus' haunches.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.350
Is there a third choice?

13:49.350 --> 13:52.309
Deputy, these woods are
Joseph's only way out of here.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.659
You saw how hard Ben hit him.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.400
No human man
walks away from that.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.619
Who said he walked?

13:57.619 --> 13:58.881
Some people think
the most efficient form

13:58.881 --> 14:00.709
of human transportation
is rolling.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.190
Are you the some
in "some people"?

14:03.190 --> 14:05.018
Well, let's just say
when I was in fifth grade,

14:05.018 --> 14:07.498
I did 40 miles per hour
rolling down Pike's Hill.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.413
My elbows, they still
sound like a bag of chains

14:09.413 --> 14:10.719
when I do push-ups.

14:10.719 --> 14:11.851
And I ain't talking 50¢ pieces.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.375
I'm talking dimes.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.376
Come on, boy.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.386
Max doesn't have a chip.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.388
Oh, thank God.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.303
Okay, okay.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.739
We need to get ours taken out.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.088
- What?
- Harry won't do it.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.308
He said mine is too close
to a nerve or something,

14:34.308 --> 14:35.396
but I--I don't care.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.311
We need to get these
taken out now.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.660
Well, what about our baby?

14:40.836 --> 14:42.403
We're gonna get her back, okay?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.839
We're gonna find a way.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.146
But I need to make sure
that you and Max are safe.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.410
Okay.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.719
It's gonna be okay.

14:54.719 --> 14:55.938
We'll take care of it.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.114
Yeah, we're gonna
take care of it.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.421
Yeah, I'm gonna call
Dr. Smallwood.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.944
You know, she can do it.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.077
- Good.

15:06.993 --> 15:10.387
Oh, and ask her
if she does lice.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.563
Max's head is filled with it.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.137
Oh, wait.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.443
We don't even know
where D'arcy is.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.487
I do.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.707
Here is the plan.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.622
One, you're going
to portal us to the tunnels

15:27.622 --> 15:29.145
underneath Yellowstone.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.973
Two, I will stop them
from using

15:30.973 --> 15:32.975
my alien ball on the caldera.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.109
Three, we're gonna climb
up this little ladder

15:36.109 --> 15:38.938
to this sort of trailer,
sort of mobile home thing

15:38.938 --> 15:39.982
they got up there.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.592
It's like their headquarters.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.942
Okay.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.639
That's where the portal is
to the spaceship.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.858
Four, we're gonna portal
aboard the ship.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.512
And five,
we're gonna blow it up.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.907
And find D'arcy.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.474
We'll see
how we're doing on time.

15:56.129 --> 15:57.826
All right, you are not going.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.306
- Thank you, Bridget.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.655
It is too dangerous.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.222
Screw that.
I want to find D'arcy.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.571
No.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.312
Six, I will find her.

16:05.312 --> 16:09.403
Seven, you stay here
and order some pizza.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.535
Eight, don't put your hands
on your hips

16:11.535 --> 16:12.841
and look at me like that.

16:12.841 --> 16:17.019
And number nine,
do not follow us.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.500
Okay, you're right.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.284
You can follow me.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.460
Son of a bitch.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.767
- Oh!
- Whee!

16:28.813 --> 16:31.512
I'm going to stop them from
filling the cavern with water.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.905
No, we're climbing the ladder
to get to the ship portal

16:33.905 --> 16:35.124
to get D'arcy.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.734
No, no,
your strawberry-haired friend

16:36.734 --> 16:37.866
has to wait.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.911
Saving the Earth
is more important.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.871
Make sure that nothing
happens to her.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.308
Ugh!

16:48.050 --> 16:50.357
The water is filling quickly.
There isn't much time.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.274
Hey.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.017
Get ready.

17:01.324 --> 17:04.197
You are making
his jacket all dirty.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.373
Hurry up.
I found son of a bitch Frank.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.986
Oh.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.205
Oh, the portal.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.691
Asta!

17:23.607 --> 17:24.869
- Come on.
- Ow!

17:34.923 --> 17:36.403
Excuse me.

17:36.403 --> 17:40.624
I hate to bother you,
but I need to use your portal.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.933
Oh, shit.
Shit.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.152
Do you have an extra
one of those

17:46.152 --> 17:47.979
little remote control things?

17:47.979 --> 17:50.243
He has one.

17:50.243 --> 17:53.289
Oh.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.421
Mine now.

17:54.421 --> 17:57.511
Okay, I'm coming for you,
D'arce.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.295
Here we go.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.950
Found it.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.392
You got this down here?
- I got it.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.133
You will stop the Yellowstone
explosion thing?

18:11.133 --> 18:13.004
Yeah.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.050
Good, good, good.
Good. Good.

18:15.050 --> 18:18.271
All right, you just keep...
doing what you're doing.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.839
And maybe we circle back
at the cabin later.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.451
We'll just circle back.

18:24.451 --> 18:25.495
Circle back.

18:25.495 --> 18:26.801
Okay.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.019
Come on, Bridget.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.766
Oh, no.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.377
No!

19:21.377 --> 19:24.685
Asta?

19:24.685 --> 19:26.034
Oh, God.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.557
Oh, my God, are you okay?

19:27.557 --> 19:28.776
Yeah.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.343
No.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.040
Okay, well,
I'm here now, okay?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.346
Yeah. Yeah.

19:33.346 --> 19:34.869
Oh, God,
I'm so glad you're here.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.914
- I was so worried about you.
- Me too.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.655
We're gonna be okay,
I promise.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.539
- Oh.

19:52.539 --> 19:53.975
Hello.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.586
Have either of you seen
a woman come through here?

19:56.586 --> 19:57.848
She has dark hair.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.460
She's wearing
a cowskin jacket.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.591
You know what?

20:01.591 --> 20:02.636
Never mind.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.203
I'll find her.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.902
This way.

20:14.952 --> 20:15.953
Redwoods.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.433
Now, see, that's a tree.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.219
Do you know there's no limit
to how tall they can get?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.133
Hell, if I live long enough,

20:22.133 --> 20:24.266
I could climb one of them
right into outer space.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.442
Plus, trees,
they put out oxygen.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.879
So I got that whole "what
to breathe in space" problem

20:28.879 --> 20:30.359
solved right there.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.013
Space sounds good
right now

20:32.013 --> 20:33.623
because no one
can hear you scream.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.327
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.854
Lena, you could have
been killed.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.290
You're the one
who could have been killed.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.074
I could have
gotten killed too.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.337
What are you doing here?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.121
Well, I could say
that I got a call

20:53.121 --> 20:55.428
about two people with guns
wandering around the woods

20:55.428 --> 20:57.038
and came to investigate.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.474
But then I'd say
you're 50 miles away

20:58.474 --> 20:59.780
from your jurisdiction

20:59.780 --> 21:01.042
and you never would have
been called for this.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.565
Then because of your
interrogation skills,

21:02.565 --> 21:04.219
I'd be forced to admit
that I've been tracking you

21:04.219 --> 21:07.831
because I'm...
worried about you.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.312
Well, thanks for caring.

21:10.312 --> 21:13.228
Truth is,
we're tracking someone too.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.534
Probably about all
I should say.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.839
We're tracking an alien,

21:15.839 --> 21:17.319
possibly a human-alien hybrid.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.843
- You're joking.
- I never joke about aliens.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.236
There's no such thing
as aliens.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.238
It's just disinformation
spread by the government

21:23.238 --> 21:25.327
to cover up
their gene-splicing program.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.198
Finally, somebody gets it.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.548
See, if I didn't think
you were perfect before,

21:28.548 --> 21:30.419
I sure as hell do now.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.768
Oh, yeah?

21:31.768 --> 21:34.205
So you think I'm perfect?

21:34.205 --> 21:37.339
I'll take Cletus
for a walk.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.558
Come on.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.342
Well, you know,
none of us are perfect,

21:40.342 --> 21:43.345
though I come pretty close.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.173
But I've spent
a lot of time thinking

21:45.173 --> 21:49.003
that maybe you come
really close too.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.483
Keep talking.

21:50.483 --> 21:51.832
You're doing good.

21:51.832 --> 21:54.878
Truth is, I really do
care about you, and...

21:54.878 --> 21:58.360
it shouldn't be as hard
for me to say that as it is.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.884
But I really would like
to see what happens

22:00.884 --> 22:03.887
if I said it more often.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.629
Try it.

22:06.629 --> 22:08.414
- I really do care about you.
- Sorry, sir.

22:08.414 --> 22:11.242
Cletus just pooped,
and I don't have a bag.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.896
Deputy, I'm in the middle
of a thing here.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.115
We're in the woods.
Just leave it.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.551
It's kind of a walking path.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.336
- Kick it off to the side.
- Right, sorry.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.381
- Yeah.
- Come on.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.078
Come on.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.994
I know I can come on strong.

22:23.994 --> 22:27.084
I don't expect you
to be the same way.

22:27.084 --> 22:31.262
I just--I need you
to meet me in the middle.

22:31.262 --> 22:35.397
I think the middle would be
a great place to start.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.746
Cletus.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.226
Oh, Deputy.
Hold on.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.836
Wait, I forgot.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.142
I do have a baggie.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.752
Oh, I don't need it anymore.

22:42.752 --> 22:45.929
I'm at the "throw away
my shoes" phase of this.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.282
Could have told me
about your dad.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.980
I would have been there
for you.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.025
You shouldn't have to.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.463
Remember the day
we met in kindergarten

22:57.463 --> 22:59.856
when I asked you if you would
give me a piggyback ride?

22:59.856 --> 23:01.771
You didn't ask.

23:01.771 --> 23:05.079
You just jumped on my back
and said, green light, go.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.472
And you did.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.214
You ran all the way to the gym.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.129
Of course I did.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.131
I'd never heard anyone
laugh like that.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.307
And I didn't want it to stop.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.571
I don't want you
to look at me

23:18.571 --> 23:21.051
like I'm a weight
you're holding.

23:21.051 --> 23:24.403
No wonder you grew up thinking
you had to take care of people.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.188
I'm your villain origin story.

23:27.188 --> 23:31.366
Okay, I know
that I'm a caretaker

23:31.366 --> 23:34.674
because sometimes I don't want
to look at my own shit.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.981
But sometimes
when I take care of people,

23:37.981 --> 23:40.201
that is taking care of me.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.203
That day was the first time
I heard you laugh,

23:42.203 --> 23:45.162
and every time I've heard
you laugh since, it just--

23:45.162 --> 23:47.600
it gives me everything I need.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.647
I love you.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.868
This is all my fault.

23:54.868 --> 23:59.568
We're gonna be okay, okay?

24:09.012 --> 24:11.362
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.016
How'd it go up there?

24:13.016 --> 24:14.453
It's out.

24:14.453 --> 24:18.892
You know, for the first time
in my life, I feel free.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.197
I'm so happy.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.156
Yeah, me too.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.854
Okay, Dr. Smallwood's
ready for you.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.686
I'm not doing it.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.296
What?

24:32.296 --> 24:33.515
I wanted to take it out.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.953
I--I was--
I was desperate to, but...

24:36.953 --> 24:42.132
after I got hypnotized
and I saw our baby, I just--

24:42.132 --> 24:43.569
I just can't.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.529
But you just let me
take mine out?

24:47.529 --> 24:51.881
They have been taking you
your whole life.

24:51.881 --> 24:54.928
I want you to have peace.

24:54.928 --> 24:58.888
But this chip is my only
connection to our daughter.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.414
And I can't leave her up there.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.852
I can't let them
keep taking you.

25:05.852 --> 25:10.160
Ben, I want them to, okay?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.554
They are going
to take me again.

25:12.554 --> 25:15.078
And when they do,

25:15.078 --> 25:17.516
I'm going to fight.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.910
And I'm not gonna stop
until we get our baby back.

25:25.915 --> 25:28.570
<i>♪ Ooh</i>

25:28.570 --> 25:30.572
<i>♪ It's time again</i>

25:30.572 --> 25:34.315
<i>♪ I must be on my way</i>

25:40.582 --> 25:43.716
<i>♪ Another day
has come and gone ♪</i>

25:43.716 --> 25:46.501
<i>♪ I'm afraid
that I can't stay ♪</i>

25:50.461 --> 25:51.767
Are you scared?

25:51.767 --> 25:53.595
You don't seem scared.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.597
I'm trying to figure out
how to get out of here.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.120
We've been here for hours.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.208
Did you bring
your toothbrush?

25:58.208 --> 25:59.906
Yes, that's a great idea.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.735
We'll make it into a knife,
and then I'll call the guard in

26:02.735 --> 26:04.345
and you shiv him.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.607
No.

26:05.607 --> 26:06.608
I don't know how long
we're gonna be here,

26:06.608 --> 26:07.783
and I really need to brush.

26:07.783 --> 26:08.958
You were gonna use mine?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.004
You weren't gonna let me?

26:11.004 --> 26:12.701
There is no escape.

26:12.701 --> 26:13.833
Well, that's terrifying.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.662
Love the cloak.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.533
You smell so good.

26:18.533 --> 26:19.795
Come on over to my side.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.405
Why would we do that?

26:21.405 --> 26:22.711
So I can eat you.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.279
I'll start with D'arcy.

26:25.279 --> 26:28.238
Oh, you look spicy.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.243
- Asta!
- Harry!

26:33.243 --> 26:35.506
- Thank God.
- Harry!

26:40.990 --> 26:43.123
Good luck finding lunch.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.994
I hate your cloak.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.475
- Where is the bomb?
- They took it.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.869
Also, my backpack
which was my favorite, so...

26:49.869 --> 26:51.522
They took it
after you took it.

26:51.522 --> 26:52.828
I wouldn't have had
to take it

26:52.828 --> 26:53.829
if you were doing your job

26:53.829 --> 26:55.352
instead of crying
into a pizza box

26:55.352 --> 26:56.658
about your bird girlfriend.
- Oh!

26:56.658 --> 26:58.007
Hey, stop it.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.487
We have to find our way
out of here, please.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.794
Bridget and I need
to find that bomb.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.018
That could complicate things.

27:10.541 --> 27:13.414
Robert, my son, I thought
I might see you here.

27:13.414 --> 27:16.373
I'm not your son, and what--
what are you doing here?

27:16.373 --> 27:18.201
Well, we came
to blow up the ship.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.639
You remember your brother,
Bridget?

27:22.205 --> 27:23.554
He is your brother.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.513
Families come
in all shapes and sizes.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.255
Wait, so you knew
I was here

27:28.255 --> 27:30.953
and you were gonna
blow up the ship anyway?

27:32.868 --> 27:34.609
I feel like
you're twisting my words.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.567
No, that's what you said.

27:36.567 --> 27:37.917
The Greys took the bomb,
but we need you

27:37.917 --> 27:40.180
to help us go to the portal.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.965
The alarm disengages
the portals up here.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.880
There's a better way out.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.927
I know where their ships are.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.059
Follow me.
- Okay.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.365
That's messed up, man.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.584
You did not call or write!

28:13.430 --> 28:15.737
- Go, go, go!
- Find your target!

28:26.966 --> 28:28.010
Got him.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.055
Be careful.

28:29.055 --> 28:30.447
We need him alive.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.275
Two days ago,
you said you wanted him dead

28:32.275 --> 28:33.973
and you were gonna eat lunch
out of his skull.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.191
Alive.

28:36.932 --> 28:39.413
You're back.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.894
Am I supposed to be scared?

28:51.773 --> 28:54.645
I should have killed you better
the first time.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.780
Ow.

29:09.573 --> 29:12.141
You might want
to take a look at this.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.579
There's a spike
in his brain activity.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.061
No!

29:24.675 --> 29:25.981
Where is my son?

29:25.981 --> 29:27.766
What did he just say?

29:33.946 --> 29:35.338
Give me my son!

29:35.338 --> 29:36.775
His consciousness is back.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.299
How is that even possible?

29:39.299 --> 29:41.301
- It's not.
- Where is he?

29:41.301 --> 29:42.693
Maybe cellular memories.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.739
Mitochondrial storage
of the self.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.436
The implications
in dementia research--

29:46.436 --> 29:48.612
- Kill him.
- Light him up!

29:55.706 --> 29:57.273
This way.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.754
What kind of alien
was in that jail cell, anyway?

29:59.754 --> 30:00.886
Yeah.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.670
And why did he know my name?

30:02.670 --> 30:03.976
That's a Mantid.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.455
They're shape-shifters.
Don't talk to them.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.892
Don't--don't even
get close to them.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.197
They get inside your head.

30:08.197 --> 30:09.938
- Huh?
- He wouldn't last a day.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.418
Son, I remember now.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.115
I did text you.
I did.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.030
I texted you and said,
hey, buddy,

30:15.030 --> 30:16.858
are you still on the ship?

30:16.858 --> 30:19.165
I might blow it up.
You may want to bounce.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.210
And then I put emoji.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.472
I was gonna do a thumb,

30:22.472 --> 30:24.866
but they don't have
purple thumbs,

30:24.866 --> 30:27.826
so I used the eggplant.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.222
And the aliens
are also wizards.

30:33.222 --> 30:34.484
Don't let them touch you
with those things.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.746
I wasn't planning on it.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.270
You should all hide.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.795
Bridget and I
will take care of this.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.797
Hello, Greys!

30:42.797 --> 30:44.538
This is my baby.

30:44.538 --> 30:47.062
He just got five
new teeth today.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.847
He wants to show them to you.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.022
Go get 'em, Bridget.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.156
Ya-ha!

30:54.156 --> 30:55.723
Get it!

30:55.723 --> 30:57.551
Let's play tug-of-war.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.770
I'm going to stick my hand
up your ass

30:59.770 --> 31:03.339
and puppet you like you belong
on public television.

31:03.339 --> 31:05.994
Tell me the alphabet.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.256
Where do you think
you're going?

31:07.256 --> 31:08.692
Hey, get back here.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.694
Oh, this one is pregnant,
I think.

31:10.694 --> 31:11.957
Are these eggs?

31:14.002 --> 31:16.222
What about you? Hey, Bridget,
get the other one.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.614
Holy shit.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.486
He's trying to get away.
Here, rip his leg off.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.140
Ow!
Now beat it.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.490
Beat it to death, yes.

31:24.447 --> 31:28.103
Oh, you can come out now.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.365
Hey.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.803
Jesus!

31:32.803 --> 31:33.892
He is so cute.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.284
I bet he tries
to bury that thing.

31:35.284 --> 31:37.069
D'arce?
Where's D'arcy?

31:37.069 --> 31:38.635
We have to get
to the launch bay.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.289
No, I'm not leaving
without her. D'arcy!

31:40.289 --> 31:42.204
Bridget and I
have to find that bomb.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.424
I will find D'arcy too.
I promise.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.295
You have to get to safety.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.688
No, Harry.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.255
Harry!

31:49.255 --> 31:51.779
Go!

31:53.085 --> 31:54.347
God.

32:10.406 --> 32:11.233
Kate?

32:13.409 --> 32:14.410
D'arcy?

32:14.410 --> 32:16.760
Oh!

32:16.760 --> 32:19.024
Oh, my God.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.416
What are you doing here?

32:20.416 --> 32:21.461
Hey.

32:21.461 --> 32:22.636
Have they been
abducting you too?

32:22.636 --> 32:24.986
No, no.
I--I kind of abducted myself.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.727
What?
Long story.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.772
I know a way out.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.050
You've got to help me.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.834
They took my baby.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.009
They took Max?

32:48.009 --> 32:50.272
No, my baby.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.491
When I was pregnant,

32:51.491 --> 32:53.754
they stole her from me.

32:53.754 --> 32:56.061
And now they've just been
bringing me up here.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.280
But I know where
they keep the babies.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.587
Please, please,
you got to help me.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.241
- You--
- No, please.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.944
Yeah. Yeah.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.511
I'm with you.

33:11.511 --> 33:12.816
Let's go.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.514
Hey.

33:14.514 --> 33:15.689
If we make it out of here,

33:15.689 --> 33:17.082
I'm not gonna remember
any of this.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.171
So...

33:19.171 --> 33:21.042
thank you.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.284
<i>Peekaboo.</i>

33:45.284 --> 33:47.895
<i>I love you so much.</i>

33:47.895 --> 33:49.723
<i>Mommy's right here.</i>

33:49.723 --> 33:51.290
This is messed up.

33:53.422 --> 33:56.164
I don't see her.

33:56.164 --> 33:57.861
This is a nightmare.

33:57.861 --> 34:00.342
Thought this is just
a shitty sci-fi cliché.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.875
<i>Mommy loves you.</i>

34:18.143 --> 34:22.234
<i>- Baby.
- You're so wonderful.</i>

34:22.234 --> 34:24.105
<i>We will always be together.</i>

34:30.024 --> 34:32.505
<i>You're getting so big.</i>

34:32.505 --> 34:35.334
<i>I will always protect you.</i>

34:35.334 --> 34:40.339
Oh, God.
<i>- Mommy loves you.</i>

34:40.339 --> 34:43.298
<i>I love you so much.</i>

34:43.298 --> 34:45.213
<i>My precious little boy.</i>

34:45.213 --> 34:47.085
<i>Aren't you a pretty baby?</i>

34:51.698 --> 34:54.266
What the hell
is taking them so long?

34:54.266 --> 34:55.832
They'll be here.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.357
Screw this.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.054
I'm gonna find her myself.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.323
<i>Aren't you a pretty baby?</i>

35:08.323 --> 35:09.455
<i>Mommy's right here.</i>

35:09.455 --> 35:10.717
Where is she?

35:10.717 --> 35:11.892
<i>It's gonna be okay, sweetie.</i>

35:11.892 --> 35:13.023
