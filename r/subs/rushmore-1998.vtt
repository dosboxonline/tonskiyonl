<i>If, and only if,
both sides of the numerator...</i>

00:44.587 --> 00:47.130
<i>is divisible by the inverse
of the square root...</i>

00:47.255 --> 00:49.674
<i>of the two unassigned variables.</i>

00:49.757 --> 00:53.012
Good. Except when the value
of the "X" coordinate...

00:53.053 --> 00:56.139
is equal to or less than
the value of one.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.475
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

00:59.601 --> 01:02.020
Oh, that?
Don't worry about that.

01:02.061 --> 01:04.521
- "M" is...
- Wait. Why?

01:04.605 --> 01:06.879
I just put that up as a joke.
That's probably...

01:06.880 --> 01:09.154
...the hardest geometry equation
in the world.

01:09.279 --> 01:11.823
How much extra credit is it worth?

01:11.948 --> 01:14.825
Well, considering I've never
seen anyone get it right,

01:14.867 --> 01:17.951
including my mentor,
Dr. Leaky at M.I.T.,

01:18.035 --> 01:20.621
I guess if anyone here
can solve that problem,

01:20.704 --> 01:23.791
I'd see to it that none of you ever
have to open another math book again...

01:23.875 --> 01:26.628
for the rest of your lives.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.719
Max? Care to try it?

01:38.222 --> 01:40.306
I'm sorry,
did someone say my name?

02:19.219 --> 02:20.469
You got it.

02:25.102 --> 02:28.562
Fischer! Fischer!
Fischer! Fischer! Fischer!

02:42.366 --> 02:43.661
Thank you.

02:45.412 --> 02:47.454
You guys have it real easy.

02:48.748 --> 02:51.625
I never had it like this
where I grew up.

02:51.750 --> 02:55.170
But I send my kids here
because, the fact is,

02:55.254 --> 02:57.967
you go to one of the best
schools in the country:

02:58.466 --> 02:59.969
- Rushmore.
- Shh.

03:00.011 --> 03:02.137
Now, for some of you,

03:02.262 --> 03:04.388
it doesn't matter.

03:04.930 --> 03:08.142
You were born rich,
and you're going to stay rich.

03:08.851 --> 03:11.187
But here's my advice
to the rest of you:

03:12.771 --> 03:17.027
Take dead aim
on the rich boys.

03:17.193 --> 03:19.654
Get them
in the crosshairs...

03:19.696 --> 03:22.157
and take them down.

03:22.324 --> 03:26.450
Just remember:
They can buy anything,

03:26.533 --> 03:29.621
but they can't buy backbone.

03:29.746 --> 03:32.122
Don't let them forget that.

03:32.707 --> 03:34.418
Thank you.

03:41.634 --> 03:44.136
Free for graduation, Herman?
Perhaps you could give us an encore.

03:44.220 --> 03:46.678
- Nicholas! Copernicus!
- I don't give a shit.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.429
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.

03:48.512 --> 03:51.310
The least these little pricks
can do is hear me out.

03:51.393 --> 03:53.853
- Hi, Dr. Guggenheim.
- Hello, Max.

03:53.895 --> 03:55.980
Hello, I'm Max Fischer.

03:56.189 --> 04:00.400
I just wanted to say that I strongly agree
with your views concerning Rushmore.

04:00.567 --> 04:03.278
Um... your speech
was excellent.

04:03.362 --> 04:05.365
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:05.573 --> 04:06.989
- Thank you.
- Hello.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.662
Oh, Mr. Blume, this is my
chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.

04:10.745 --> 04:12.829
Nice to meet you, Dirk.

04:12.913 --> 04:14.873
Well, thanks.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.546
You know...

04:21.712 --> 04:25.007
I really think you're
right about Rushmore.

04:25.174 --> 04:27.217
Come on, Dirk.

04:29.554 --> 04:32.474
- What's his name again?
- Max Fischer.

04:33.724 --> 04:35.644
Sharp little guy.

04:38.229 --> 04:41.481
He's one of the worst
students we've got.

04:53.743 --> 04:56.705
<i># Makin' time #</i>

04:57.330 --> 04:59.709
<i># Shootin' lines #</i>

05:00.584 --> 05:03.211
<i># For people to believe in #</i>

05:04.130 --> 05:05.757
<i># Things you say #</i>

05:07.550 --> 05:10.761
<i># Gone in a day #</i>

05:10.970 --> 05:13.638
<i># Everybody leavin' #</i>

05:14.388 --> 05:17.640
<i># Everybody leavin' #</i>

05:17.849 --> 05:21.228
<i># Why do we have to carry on #</i>

05:21.395 --> 05:24.566
<i># Always singin'
the same old song #</i>

05:24.649 --> 05:26.108
<i># Same old song #</i>

05:26.275 --> 05:29.905
<i>- # The same old song #
- You! You're out!</i>

05:36.658 --> 05:38.620
<i># Tellin' lies #</i>

05:39.828 --> 05:42.167
<i># Closing your eyes #</i>

05:46.670 --> 05:48.672
<i># Pullin' the wool #</i>

05:49.839 --> 05:52.092
<i># Actin' the fool ##</i>

05:58.306 --> 06:01.727
We're putting you on what we call
"sudden death academic probation".

06:02.436 --> 06:04.437
And what does that entail?

06:04.605 --> 06:06.897
It entails that if you
fail another class,

06:07.064 --> 06:09.315
you'll be asked
to leave Rushmore.

06:09.482 --> 06:11.151
In other words,
I'll be expelled.

06:11.275 --> 06:12.568
That's correct.

06:12.694 --> 06:15.322
Could I see some documentation
on that, please?

06:16.907 --> 06:19.117
Too many extracurricular
activities, Max.

06:19.243 --> 06:21.371
Not enough studying.

06:25.332 --> 06:28.876
Dr. Guggenheim, I don't want
to tell you how to do your job,

06:28.960 --> 06:30.919
but, the fact is,
no matter how hard I try,

06:31.002 --> 06:33.004
I still might
flunk another class.

06:33.129 --> 06:36.927
If that means I have to stay on for a
postgraduate year, then so be it, but...

06:37.010 --> 06:39.096
We don't offer
a postgraduate year.

06:39.221 --> 06:42.223
Well... we don't offer it yet.

06:42.306 --> 06:44.308
Just bring up the grades.

06:45.142 --> 06:48.146
Do you remember how
I got into this school?

06:48.313 --> 06:52.315
- Yes. You wrote a play.
- That's right.

06:52.399 --> 06:56.530
Second grade.
A little one act about Watergate.

06:56.613 --> 06:59.032
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

06:59.116 --> 07:02.201
And you read it, and
you gave me a scholarship, didn't you?

07:02.827 --> 07:04.370
Mm-hmm.

07:04.453 --> 07:07.414
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it.

07:07.581 --> 07:10.125
But I still might
have to expel you.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.086
Couldn't...

07:12.169 --> 07:14.838
Couldn't we just
let me float by?

07:15.465 --> 07:17.090
For old time's sake?

07:17.257 --> 07:19.301
Can't do it, Max.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.763
- They want to kick me out.
- Oh, no, not again.

07:23.889 --> 07:26.433
- What are you gonna do?
- The only thing I can do:

07:26.557 --> 07:29.021
try and pull some strings
with the administration, I guess.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.443
Did you hear they're teaching
Japanese next year?

07:36.567 --> 07:38.527
That's the rumor.

07:38.944 --> 07:40.655
And they're canceling Latin.

07:40.822 --> 07:42.366
What?

07:42.533 --> 07:45.452
I tried to get Latin
canceled for five years.

07:45.577 --> 07:47.621
"It's a dead language,"
I'd always say.

07:47.747 --> 07:50.750
Well, I guess
they finally heard you.

08:05.971 --> 08:07.222
Excuse me.

08:08.263 --> 08:09.975
Could I please see a list
of all the people...

08:10.059 --> 08:12.185
who've checked out this book
in the past year?

08:12.269 --> 08:13.978
Why?

08:15.231 --> 08:17.147
Look at that.

08:57.769 --> 09:01.650
"I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both;

09:01.775 --> 09:04.445
"and I believe they both
get paid in the end.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.030
"But the fools first.

09:07.114 --> 09:11.200
Chapter 15.
The Lad with the Silver Button. "

09:14.286 --> 09:16.579
- Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.
- Where are you going?

09:16.662 --> 09:18.710
I'll tell you
in the squad car.

09:18.876 --> 09:20.753
Oh, and, Willie,

09:20.879 --> 09:23.130
you were wrong
about Enrique Sanchez.

09:23.255 --> 09:25.591
He died in his sleep.

09:26.216 --> 09:28.174
Excellent. That was excellent.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.176
That was great.
That was great.

09:30.218 --> 09:33.764
Um, Irving... could you get some
root beers for anybody who wants one?

09:33.890 --> 09:35.559
- I don't want one, okay?
- Okay.

09:35.726 --> 09:37.603
All right, next scene.

09:38.477 --> 09:41.856
Frank, you enter stage right
with a bag of cocaine.

09:42.024 --> 09:44.650
I was just telling Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are...

09:44.734 --> 09:46.255
- to have someone like
you looking out for Dirk.

09:46.256 --> 09:47.777
Oh, don't be silly.

09:47.944 --> 09:50.363
Dirk's a great kid,
and I'm just trying to impart...

09:50.488 --> 09:54.619
some of the experiences
I've accrued to help him.

09:54.744 --> 09:56.911
This has my number on it
if you need to call me...

09:57.036 --> 10:00.040
or need help with Dirk
or anything like that.

10:00.165 --> 10:02.667
Well, thank you very much.
Hello, Dirk.

10:02.751 --> 10:04.837
- Hi, Mom.
- How are you, honey?

10:04.962 --> 10:06.629
- Fine.
- Bye.

10:06.754 --> 10:08.213
It was so nice
to see you again.

10:09.215 --> 10:12.803
- Hey, Dirk. How'd your math test go?
- What math test?

10:12.970 --> 10:15.473
- I thought you had a math test today.
- No.

10:15.556 --> 10:18.224
Did you turn in your paper
on the Berlin Airlift?

10:18.349 --> 10:19.935
Yeah, I got an extension.

10:20.351 --> 10:23.062
- Hey, George.
- So how'd it go with Mrs. Calloway?

10:23.187 --> 10:26.149
- We shook hands.
- Big deal.

10:26.316 --> 10:28.316
And I gave her
my phone number.

10:28.483 --> 10:30.778
Buchan said he'd have
already banged her by now.

10:30.904 --> 10:32.155
What?

10:32.279 --> 10:35.491
Just tell that deformed Scottish gorilla
to shut his fat face.

10:36.576 --> 10:38.785
That's my best friend's mother
he's talking about.

10:38.868 --> 10:42.539
I always thought that's why
you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.

10:43.038 --> 10:44.791
What are you, a lawyer?

10:44.916 --> 10:48.836
Hey, Mr. Blume.
Hey, it's Max Fischer.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.630
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Max, my mom just showed up.</i>

10:51.713 --> 10:53.551
<i>Is it okay if I leave early? Over.</i>

10:53.676 --> 10:55.427
Sure, Charlie.

11:01.223 --> 11:03.266
What's the secret, Max?

11:03.391 --> 11:05.017
- "The secret"?
- Yeah.

11:05.101 --> 11:08.523
Well, you seem to have it
pretty figured out.

11:08.606 --> 11:10.900
The secret.
I don't know. Uh...

11:10.942 --> 11:13.402
I think you just gotta find
something you love to do,

11:13.485 --> 11:17.072
and then do it
for the rest of your life.

11:17.239 --> 11:19.574
For me, it's going to Rushmore.

11:21.785 --> 11:22.494
Shotgun.

11:22.578 --> 11:26.125
- Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. How you guys...
- Get in the back. I said, "Shotgun".

11:26.208 --> 11:28.209
Get in the back, Donny.

11:30.377 --> 11:32.170
Let's go.

11:35.548 --> 11:37.049
Did you invite that kid
to your party?

11:37.133 --> 11:39.552
- Max Fischer? - Come on, Dad.
There's gonna be girls there.

11:39.635 --> 11:42.390
- I'd rather die.
- Pull your head out of your ass.

11:45.225 --> 11:46.977
- Good night, Mr. Littlejeans.
- Good night, Max.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.936
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.904
May I see the back, please?

11:59.987 --> 12:01.909
Certainly.

12:04.828 --> 12:06.038
How's that?

12:06.121 --> 12:08.371
Thank you.

12:10.248 --> 12:13.251
I need a signature on this
geometry test, by the way.

12:13.335 --> 12:15.005
Let's see.

12:17.087 --> 12:19.257
- Hmm.
- I know, I know.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.259
A 37.

12:23.596 --> 12:26.140
Oh, I don't know
what to do anymore.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.266
It could have been worse.

12:30.434 --> 12:32.602
You almost got the "A".

12:32.685 --> 12:35.521
"Almost got the 'A"'?
Dad, what are you writing?

12:42.447 --> 12:45.116
Maybe I'm spending too much
of my time starting up clubs...

12:45.200 --> 12:47.368
and putting on plays.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.452
That's possible.

12:50.078 --> 12:53.456
I should probably be trying
harder to score chicks.

12:53.622 --> 12:56.503
That's the only thing
anybody really cares about.

12:57.002 --> 12:59.463
It's not my forte, unfortunately.

12:59.547 --> 13:01.673
It'll happen, Max. It's just...

13:01.756 --> 13:04.343
You're like one
of those clipper ship captains.

13:04.801 --> 13:06.679
You're married to the sea.

13:06.844 --> 13:08.722
Yes, that's true.

13:08.764 --> 13:12.225
But I've been out to sea
for a long time.

13:18.648 --> 13:21.484
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:30.659 --> 13:31.786
I like your hat.

13:32.704 --> 13:34.663
Oh, thank you.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.833
You're a teacher here,
aren't you?

13:39.918 --> 13:42.005
And this is your first year
at Rushmore, I take it.

13:42.171 --> 13:44.172
Uh-huh.

13:45.007 --> 13:47.966
And how long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

13:48.133 --> 13:51.764
Well, let's see now.
How old are you?

13:51.931 --> 13:53.183
Fifteen.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.476
- Since I was your age.
- You're kidding.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.145
You should quit.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.772
You're right.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.693
And I should mind my own business.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.492
Where did you go
to school, by the way?

14:12.618 --> 14:14.787
- Harvard.
- Really?

14:14.913 --> 14:16.288
That's a coincidence.

14:16.413 --> 14:20.041
My top schools where I want
to apply to are Oxford and the Sorbonne.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.460
My safety's Harvard.

14:22.668 --> 14:24.920
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you.

14:25.045 --> 14:27.047
What do you want to study?

14:27.923 --> 14:30.801
Well... I haven't
decided for sure,

14:30.885 --> 14:35.640
but probably a double major
in mathematics and premed.

14:35.723 --> 14:37.640
What was your major?

14:37.723 --> 14:42.560
I didn't have a major, but my thesis
was on Latin American economic policy.

14:42.644 --> 14:46.984
Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear they're
not going to teach Latin here anymore?

14:47.151 --> 14:49.819
This was more like Central America.

14:49.903 --> 14:52.822
Oh, Central America
and whatnot. Hmm.

14:52.906 --> 14:55.659
But moving on:
They're gonna cancel Latin.

14:55.784 --> 14:58.827
They've got
to make room for Japanese.

14:58.911 --> 15:03.000
That's a shame because all the Romance
languages were based on Latin.

15:03.167 --> 15:05.085
Yeah, they are,
aren't they?

15:05.503 --> 15:08.088
Nihilo sanctum estne?

15:08.255 --> 15:11.840
What's that?
Oh, it's Latin, isn't it?

15:12.007 --> 15:13.842
What does that mean?

15:14.802 --> 15:16.970
"Is nothing sacred?"

15:23.685 --> 15:27.398
Sic transit gloria.
Glory fades.

15:27.523 --> 15:30.025
I'm Max Fischer.

15:30.192 --> 15:32.735
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:37.572 --> 15:40.327
- Come on, come on. File out.
- Sign here, please.

15:40.369 --> 15:42.162
- Sic transit gloria.
- All right, all right.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.339
In summation,
I have only one question:

15:53.172 --> 15:55.049
Is Latin dead?

16:00.347 --> 16:04.017
Why don't you just piss off,
Fischer, you dotty skid mark?

16:04.142 --> 16:05.476
Was that Latin?

16:12.899 --> 16:15.195
Never in my wildest
imagination...

16:15.278 --> 16:18.613
did I ever dream
I would have sons like these.

16:20.407 --> 16:22.993
What's your dad do, Max?

16:23.827 --> 16:28.538
He's a neurosurgeon...
at, uh, St. Joseph's Hospital.

16:28.705 --> 16:31.582
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain,

16:31.665 --> 16:34.504
but he seems to enjoy it.

16:35.757 --> 16:37.632
Oh, no, no, no. I got this one.

16:40.091 --> 16:42.969
- So you were in Vietnam,
if I'm not mistaken? - Yeah.

16:45.055 --> 16:47.141
Were you in the shit?

16:47.225 --> 16:49.601
Yeah, I was in the shit.

16:51.103 --> 16:52.397
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.

16:52.481 --> 16:55.317
- All right.
- What's on Sunday?

16:55.525 --> 16:57.985
Oh, that's right.
The twins' birthday party.

16:59.528 --> 17:01.362
Do you want to come?

17:01.487 --> 17:05.325
I'd love to, except I've already got
a previous obligation to attend to.

17:05.407 --> 17:08.704
Yeah. Thanks for
the invitation, though.

17:10.579 --> 17:13.084
Come work for me.

17:13.251 --> 17:18.253
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I could use someone like you.

17:19.673 --> 17:22.090
Look, I may not be rich, Mr. Blume.

17:22.174 --> 17:25.051
My father may only be
a doctor, but we manage.

17:25.176 --> 17:28.765
- One-twelves!
- Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking to you.

17:31.059 --> 17:32.769
You're on the team?

17:33.644 --> 17:34.770
I'm an alternate.

17:35.981 --> 17:38.816
How you doin'?
Good to see you again.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.744
Whoa. Neat.

17:58.709 --> 18:04.425
<i># Met a girl, fell in love
Glad as I can be #</i>

18:07.051 --> 18:12.557
<i># Met a girl, fell in love
Glad as I can be #</i>

18:15.018 --> 18:20.104
<i># But I think all the time
Is she true to me #</i>

18:22.526 --> 18:24.946
<i># 'Cause there's nothing
in this world #</i>

18:25.030 --> 18:29.282
<i># To stop me worrying
about that girl #</i>

18:31.825 --> 18:36.496
<i># I found out I was wrong
She was just two-timing #</i>

18:40.042 --> 18:45.673
<i># I found out I was wrong
She just kept on lying #</i>

18:48.549 --> 18:51.135
<i># Now she tries
to tell the truth #</i>

18:51.219 --> 18:55.472
<i># And I just can't believe #</i>

18:56.682 --> 18:58.809
<i># 'Cause there's nothing
in this world #</i>

18:58.893 --> 19:04.525
<i># To stop me worrying
about that girl ##</i>

19:10.153 --> 19:12.071
<i>Miss Cross?</i>

19:12.196 --> 19:15.324
I thought I'd just let you know
as per our conversation, the other day...

19:15.411 --> 19:18.079
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance languages.

19:18.121 --> 19:20.915
- Well, I gave a little speech.
- I heard about this.

19:20.998 --> 19:22.415
Oh, you did?

19:22.541 --> 19:26.254
I understand you made
a very convincing argument.

19:27.088 --> 19:31.883
I just thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're gonna continue the Latin program.

19:32.050 --> 19:33.928
I'm very impressed.

19:34.095 --> 19:36.681
Well, thank you very much.

19:37.265 --> 19:39.349
Hey, you need an assistant?

19:39.599 --> 19:41.351
- Do we get to have an
assistant around here?

19:41.352 --> 19:43.103
No, I doubt it.

19:43.144 --> 19:45.605
I'm on scholarship, though...
academic scholarship...

19:45.689 --> 19:48.274
so I get to do odd jobs and...

19:48.357 --> 19:50.943
Say, how did you decide
to teach at Rushmore?

19:51.026 --> 19:52.946
My husband went here.

19:55.364 --> 19:59.870
I, uh... I didn't know
you were married.

20:00.036 --> 20:01.955
Well, he's dead now.

20:02.038 --> 20:03.956
So I'm not, actually.

20:04.039 --> 20:06.291
When did he die?

20:06.457 --> 20:08.126
Last year.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.631
My mother's dead.

20:12.717 --> 20:14.759
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:14.926 --> 20:17.552
She died when I was seven.

20:17.719 --> 20:20.806
I guess we both have
dead people in our families.

20:25.394 --> 20:27.811
What's going on in here?

20:29.900 --> 20:32.194
These were just born.

20:34.404 --> 20:37.447
I don't want alloys. I want steel.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.825
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.954
Steel, Harry.

20:46.664 --> 20:49.832
- So you've changed your mind,
and you want the job? - No.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.169
But I've got an idea,
and I need some money.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.838
What Rushmore
needs is an aquarium...

20:54.922 --> 20:57.507
a first-class aquarium...
where the scientists can lecture...

20:57.590 --> 21:00.842
and the students can observe
the marine life in its natural habitat.

21:00.967 --> 21:03.470
- I don't know. What do you think, Ernie?
- An aquarium?

21:03.553 --> 21:05.536
What kind of fish?

21:05.537 --> 21:07.519
- Barracudas, stingrays,
electric eel, trout,

21:07.602 --> 21:10.521
hammerheads, piranhas,
giant squid, octopi...

21:10.604 --> 21:12.606
Piranhas? Really?

21:12.607 --> 21:14.607
- Yes, I'm talking to
a guy in South America.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.403
- What'd Guggenheim say?
- Nothing. I felt I should go to you first.

21:18.529 --> 21:20.404
Why?

21:20.571 --> 21:24.160
Because at this moment, I feel the
best strategy is to keep it low profile.

21:24.202 --> 21:27.163
The more preparation work I can do,
the stronger our case will be...

21:27.204 --> 21:30.206
- when we take it to the administration.
- How much money do you want?

21:30.706 --> 21:34.502
Thirty-five thousand dollars,
for the initial plans.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.389
I'll give you 2,500.

21:46.556 --> 21:47.932
Okay.

21:57.106 --> 21:59.820
<i># Trees #</i>

21:59.902 --> 22:03.865

22:36.146 --> 22:38.104
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:16.017 --> 23:18.311
- Max.
- Mm-hmm?

23:18.478 --> 23:21.854
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

23:22.898 --> 23:26.693
Has it ever crossed your mind
that you're far too young for me?

23:31.782 --> 23:35.410
It crossed my mind that you might
consider that a possibility. Yeah.

23:35.494 --> 23:37.870
Quite apart from the fact
that you're a student...

23:37.995 --> 23:40.915
I'm not trying to pressure you
into anything, Miss Cross.

23:40.998 --> 23:42.937
- I'm surprised you
brought it up so bluntly.

23:42.938 --> 23:44.877
I just want to make sure...

23:47.674 --> 23:50.468
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes.

23:50.593 --> 23:52.261
Good.

23:52.761 --> 23:55.054
And, um...

23:55.179 --> 23:58.683
the... the truth is, neither
one of us has the slightest idea...

23:58.766 --> 24:00.600
where this relationship is going.

24:00.725 --> 24:04.313
- We can't predict the future.
- We don't have a relationship, Max.

24:04.397 --> 24:07.235
- But we're friends.
- Yes, and that's all we're going to be.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.903
That's all I meant by "relationship".

24:10.028 --> 24:11.780
You want me to grab a dictionary?

24:11.905 --> 24:15.616
No, I just want to make sure
that we understand each other.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.701
I understand.

24:17.868 --> 24:20.871
You're not attracted to me.

24:21.037 --> 24:22.956
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

24:23.709 --> 24:26.169
Max, you're 15 years old.

24:26.835 --> 24:29.462
Attraction doesn't enter into it.

24:29.588 --> 24:31.507
If you say so.

24:31.632 --> 24:33.843
Look, all I'm getting at is that...

24:36.803 --> 24:39.346
that I've never met anyone like you.

24:41.139 --> 24:43.728
So you can take that
for whatever it's worth.

24:46.147 --> 24:50.567
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you either.

24:54.445 --> 24:56.281
You haven't, have you?

24:59.115 --> 25:01.286
Want to shake hands?

25:02.411 --> 25:05.247
I'm glad we had this conversation.

25:05.414 --> 25:06.750
So am I.

25:08.458 --> 25:10.584
I can't wear a wire.
They're feeling me up every day.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.545
Oh, come on, Frank.
You'll have complete protection.

25:13.670 --> 25:15.507
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

25:15.589 --> 25:17.674
- I gotta put a dime in the meter.
- Sit down, Frank.

25:17.758 --> 25:21.094
Joe, go put a dime in the meter
for Officer Serpico.

25:21.261 --> 25:24.557
- Look, Serpico, if you agree
to testify in open court... - No!

25:24.682 --> 25:27.894
- No, what?
- No, I'm not gonna testify.

25:28.019 --> 25:29.436
Go, go, go.

25:29.937 --> 25:33.357
I'll expect your gun
and your badge on my desk...

25:34.274 --> 25:36.404
- Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
- Name it.

25:36.446 --> 25:39.156
That you're gonna follow this thing
all the way to the end...

25:39.281 --> 25:41.533
of the line... where I got to be.

25:41.658 --> 25:43.325
So help me God.

25:43.492 --> 25:45.452
<i>- Someone coming out of the building.
- I've got something!</i>

25:45.536 --> 25:48.579
<i>- Wait. This could be it.
- There's action across the street.</i>

25:48.704 --> 25:50.999
<i>- Yeah, it's him.
- It's Snowman.</i>

25:53.252 --> 25:55.548
- He's getting on the "L" train!
- Take him!

25:57.882 --> 26:00.050
- What happened to the cannoli line?
- Max...

26:00.133 --> 26:03.345
You're supposed to say, "Forget about it,
Sanchez. The old man likes his cannolis".

26:03.428 --> 26:06.056
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
It didn't make any difference anyway.

26:06.181 --> 26:08.724
Hey, I'm letting it go,
but don't say it doesn't matter.

26:08.808 --> 26:11.394
- Every line matters.
- Get off my back!

26:11.477 --> 26:13.438
Don't fuck with my play!

26:14.106 --> 26:16.065
- You fucking cocksucker...
- Hey, break it up. Break it up.

26:16.232 --> 26:17.943
I'm gonna kill you.

26:24.949 --> 26:27.492
Max. Max.

26:52.436 --> 26:53.791
- I thought the acting
tonight was excellent.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.147
Thanks.

26:55.272 --> 26:57.856
Well, it was better in rehearsals.

26:58.023 --> 27:00.650
I'll catch up with you later, Dad.
I got a dinner to go to.

27:00.775 --> 27:04.069
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Cast and crew only.

27:04.153 --> 27:07.199
- Oh. You need some money?
- No, Dad.

27:10.325 --> 27:13.120
- Well, how was the slap?
- It was good.

27:13.245 --> 27:16.457
- There he is. Max, that was great.
- I'm so glad you could come.

27:16.583 --> 27:19.542
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Peter Flynn, Max Fischer.

27:19.584 --> 27:22.003
- Hi.
- Who's this guy?

27:23.754 --> 27:26.195
Peter.

27:26.196 --> 27:28.637
- I really liked your
play. It was really cool.

27:28.802 --> 27:32.180
- Yeah.
- What happened to your nose?

27:33.098 --> 27:35.684
- I got punched in the face.
- Oh, boy.

27:35.768 --> 27:39.104
- What's your excuse?
- Hey, author.

27:39.230 --> 27:40.730
- How you doing?
- Nice job.

27:40.855 --> 27:43.359
- Thank you.
- Gonna get to meet your dad tonight?

27:43.442 --> 27:45.402
Oh, no. The old man's on call.

27:45.444 --> 27:47.405
Mr. Blume, I'd like you
to meet Miss Cross...

27:47.447 --> 27:50.407
and I didn't catch
this young gentleman's name.

27:51.741 --> 27:54.619
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.

27:54.744 --> 27:57.204
These are O.R. scrubs.

27:57.413 --> 27:59.497
"O.R." they?

28:01.417 --> 28:04.169
Well, they're totally
inappropriate for the occasion.

28:04.294 --> 28:06.549
Well, I didn't know
we were going to dinner.

28:06.715 --> 28:08.967
That's because you weren't invited.

28:09.133 --> 28:11.344
Take it easy, Max.

28:11.345 --> 28:13.554
- You were the one that
ordered him a whiskey and soda.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.429
So what's wrong with that?

28:15.555 --> 28:19.812
I can write a hit play. Why can't I have
a little drink to unwind myself?

28:21.688 --> 28:24.315
So, tell me, curly,
how do you know Miss Cross?

28:24.440 --> 28:26.483
- We went to Harvard together.
- Oh, that's great.

28:26.608 --> 28:28.526
I wrote a hit play
and directed it.

28:28.609 --> 28:30.946
So I'm not sweating it either.

28:31.113 --> 28:32.530
Can we get a check, please?

28:32.615 --> 28:34.825
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting the check.

28:34.950 --> 28:36.868
No, you're not. Excuse me.

28:37.034 --> 28:38.997
I just want to thank you
for accommodating us.

28:39.122 --> 28:41.166
You see, we only thought
we were going to be three,

28:41.291 --> 28:44.669
but, uh, someone invited
himself along, so I apologize.

28:44.794 --> 28:48.170
- Quite all right, sir. Very well.
- Okay.

28:48.336 --> 28:50.006
You're being rude, Max.

28:50.173 --> 28:51.548
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

28:51.674 --> 28:55.052
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out
why you brought this gentleman to my play...

28:55.178 --> 28:58.097
and my dinner,
which was invitation only.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.141
- Would you like me to
pass you the creamer, Doc?

29:00.142 --> 29:01.601
Yes, please.

29:02.686 --> 29:05.689
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

29:05.814 --> 29:09.647
You hurt my feelings!
This night was important to me!

29:09.814 --> 29:11.775
How did I hurt your feelings?

29:11.859 --> 29:16.241
Oh, my God!
I wrote a hit play!

29:20.409 --> 29:22.829
And I'm in love with you.

29:31.505 --> 29:33.508
Put that a little bit there.

29:52.899 --> 29:56.612
- Hi.
- Were you hiding over there?

29:56.779 --> 29:59.865
Uh, I didn't want
to disrupt class.

30:01.407 --> 30:03.368
What's that you're painting?

30:03.409 --> 30:06.662
That's a... a jellyfish.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.625
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?

30:09.792 --> 30:11.836
Max wants to talk to you.

30:11.919 --> 30:15.672
- What for?
- To apologize, I think.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.173
Should we talk over here?

30:20.467 --> 30:21.720
He sent you?

30:21.762 --> 30:23.388
Yeah.

30:23.930 --> 30:26.308
Are you his messenger?

30:27.060 --> 30:29.645
No, I'm his friend.

30:29.895 --> 30:34.357
You were right.
I should not have allowed him to drink.

30:36.109 --> 30:39.694
I don't think
I should see Max anymore.

30:39.861 --> 30:42.405
Well, he's not gonna like
the sound of that.

30:42.572 --> 30:45.201
No. No, I know, but...

30:45.368 --> 30:48.202
I think I let him
get too attached.

30:49.122 --> 30:50.539
What do you think?

30:51.916 --> 30:53.876
Well, I think
you did your best.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.047
Tell him I'm sorry.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.432
Okay.

31:09.849 --> 31:12.185
What is your first name?

31:13.353 --> 31:16.982
Rosemary. What's yours?

31:17.148 --> 31:18.523
Herman.

31:22.945 --> 31:24.823
He wrote you a letter.

31:24.990 --> 31:26.700
<i>Dear Miss Cross,</i>

31:26.783 --> 31:29.201
<i>I would like to take this opportunity
to formally apologize...</i>

31:29.284 --> 31:31.827
<i>for the events
of the night of the 23rd.</i>

31:31.952 --> 31:34.538
<i>I'm not accustomed
to drinking alcohol.</i>

31:34.622 --> 31:38.835
<i>Please do me the service of coming to the
unveiling of a new venture I've undertaken.</i>

31:38.919 --> 31:41.795
<i>I hope you will attend,
if possible.</i>

31:41.962 --> 31:45.258
<i>I remain your friend, Max Fischer.</i>

31:52.555 --> 31:54.725
Cut the music and no more pictures.

31:54.808 --> 31:57.022
- What time is it, Alan?
- 1:15.

31:57.147 --> 32:00.149
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hey, lay off the chips, Buchan.

32:00.899 --> 32:01.733
Did you see her?

32:01.817 --> 32:03.868
- She's not here.
- Well, go check her classroom.

32:03.951 --> 32:05.861
- Shall I go ahead and
take care of this tree?

32:05.962 --> 32:07.170
Let's wait a few minutes.

32:07.354 --> 32:09.531
- What's going on here, Maxie?
- Oh, hey, Coach Beck. Good to see you.

32:09.656 --> 32:11.243
This is where we're
putting in the new aquarium.

32:11.326 --> 32:13.244
I'm in charge of the committee,
if you can believe it.

32:13.327 --> 32:15.998
This is my baseball diamond.

32:16.207 --> 32:20.084
Yeah, I know, and I believe
it's being relocated a few feet over.

32:20.167 --> 32:22.878
Is it true the aquarium
will have piranhas?

32:23.045 --> 32:24.900
Where did you hear that?

32:24.901 --> 32:26.757
- My source indicated
that it was a possibility.

32:26.966 --> 32:29.342
Yes, it's true, but piranhas
are a very tricky species.

32:29.425 --> 32:32.178
- Max?
- Excuse me, George.

32:32.262 --> 32:34.181
- Bad news.
- What's the story?

32:34.265 --> 32:36.516
- She had a substitute teacher today.
- Why?

32:36.599 --> 32:38.309
I guess she got sick.

32:38.310 --> 32:40.020
- You know she's not
sick. Give me the phone.

32:44.107 --> 32:46.359
Janet, Max Fischer.
Is Mr. Blume there?

32:48.152 --> 32:49.777
Well, where is he?

32:50.403 --> 32:52.324
Goddamn it.
He's supposed to be here.

32:53.159 --> 32:54.994
I don't give a shit
about the barracudas,

32:55.035 --> 32:57.538
but, fuck it, I'm building it anyway.

32:59.414 --> 33:00.539
Max!

33:00.706 --> 33:02.542
Where are those damn
chain saws coming from?

33:02.625 --> 33:04.545
- He's right over there!
- Max!

33:04.628 --> 33:06.713
- Max!
- Oh, hello, Dr. Guggenheim.

33:06.796 --> 33:09.382
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- We're having a fund-raiser for the...

33:09.465 --> 33:11.467
Turn that damn thing off!

33:12.218 --> 33:14.012
Tell me this isn't happening.

33:14.053 --> 33:17.140
Dr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have
this conversation in front of my crew.

33:41.702 --> 33:43.371
...chapter seven.

33:44.288 --> 33:47.921
One more thing.
We have a new student with us today.

33:48.087 --> 33:51.422
His name's Max Fischer,
and he's actually asked...

33:51.547 --> 33:53.799
to say a few words to the class.

33:54.050 --> 33:56.719
Max, you want to take it away?

33:57.094 --> 33:59.514
Sure. Thanks very much.

34:01.139 --> 34:03.224
I just wanted to introduce myself.

34:09.063 --> 34:10.733
I'm Max Fischer.

34:10.775 --> 34:13.568
I'm a former student
of Rushmore Academy,

34:13.610 --> 34:16.321
which I recently
got expelled from.

34:18.531 --> 34:21.033
This is my first time
in a public school.

34:21.199 --> 34:24.496
I know you probably think I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth,

34:24.578 --> 34:26.706
but I'm no elitist.

34:26.873 --> 34:29.167
I think you've got
some great facilities,

34:29.251 --> 34:32.753
and I'm really looking forward to making
the best of it here at Grover Cleveland.

34:33.254 --> 34:35.172
One footnote.

34:35.255 --> 34:37.716
I notice you don't have
a fencing team.

34:37.882 --> 34:41.054
Well, I'm gonna try my hardest
to start one up for you guys.

34:45.976 --> 34:48.186
- Max?
- Yes?

34:48.268 --> 34:51.272
Hi, I'm Margaret Yang.
I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.

34:51.438 --> 34:54.567
- I just wanted to tell you that
I liked your speech. - Thank you.

34:54.692 --> 34:58.697
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.865
No? How unfortunate.

35:00.948 --> 35:04.202
The silver spoon remark
might rub some people the wrong way,

35:04.327 --> 35:06.120
- but I think I know...
- What do you mean?

35:06.245 --> 35:07.705
- Well...
- You know what?

35:07.788 --> 35:11.206
I gotta go into class in here.
I'll see you later, Mrs. Chang.

35:14.543 --> 35:16.630
En garde!

35:26.348 --> 35:28.431
Janet, Max Fischer. Is he in?

35:33.185 --> 35:34.315
Yeah?

35:35.024 --> 35:36.483
Okay.

35:37.568 --> 35:38.692
Hey, Max, how's it going?

35:38.817 --> 35:41.444
Terrible. Tell me something. When you
talked to Miss Cross the other day...

35:41.527 --> 35:43.905
Do you have a telephone pass?

35:44.071 --> 35:47.074
- Excuse me. Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.181
I gotta tell ya, I don't know
what you see in her.

35:49.182 --> 35:51.162
I don'tthink she's right for you.

35:51.245 --> 35:52.831
What's that supposed to mean?

35:55.375 --> 35:57.669
I mean, she's not
that beautiful.

35:57.753 --> 36:01.088
She's not that intriguing.

36:01.172 --> 36:05.009
I mean, she has something that
you can't put your finger on, but...

36:05.133 --> 36:07.720
Look, Mr. Blume, your comments are
valuable, but let's get to the point.

36:07.844 --> 36:10.681
- Son?
- Will she see me again, yes or no?

36:11.098 --> 36:13.475
- No.
- Hang on.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.479
I'm talking on the telephone.

36:17.230 --> 36:19.064
Oh, come on.

36:19.356 --> 36:20.817
That's rude.

36:36.749 --> 36:38.250
Hey, Fischer.

36:39.543 --> 36:41.585
You better beat it, sonny.

36:41.794 --> 36:44.673
You know, Fischer,
I've been watching you.

36:45.590 --> 36:48.011
Showboat. Always talkin'.

36:48.137 --> 36:52.430
Picking a kid like Dirk because his mother's
a great piece, and then getting nowhere.

36:52.556 --> 36:54.516
Like everything you do.

36:54.599 --> 36:57.643
Big show. No results.

36:57.852 --> 37:02.313
What do you call getting a hand job from
Mrs. Calloway in the back of her Jaguar?

37:03.064 --> 37:04.694
A fucking lie.

37:04.861 --> 37:09.531
You think I got kicked out
for just the aquarium? Nah.

37:09.656 --> 37:13.284
It was the hand job.
You want to know something else?

37:13.450 --> 37:15.120
It was worth it.

37:17.538 --> 37:20.331
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.

37:20.456 --> 37:23.754
And please apologize
to what's-his-name for me.

37:24.212 --> 37:28.049
I will. You okay?

37:28.216 --> 37:31.969
Yeah, I'm fine,
but I miss Rushmore.

37:32.135 --> 37:34.095
I miss the seasons.

37:34.637 --> 37:37.099
Watching the leaves change.

37:37.266 --> 37:40.308
By the way, what time
does the library close?

37:40.475 --> 37:43.104
I've got an overdue book
to turn in.

37:50.110 --> 37:52.153
That is your handwriting,
isn't it?

37:53.697 --> 37:54.947
My husband gave me this book...

37:55.031 --> 37:58.493
when he came to visit England
when I was 13 and he went to Rushmore.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.163
So when he died,
I gave it to the library here.

38:03.958 --> 38:06.461
You remind me of him, you know?

38:07.378 --> 38:08.962
I do?

38:09.463 --> 38:11.130
How?

38:11.214 --> 38:13.215
Well...

38:14.342 --> 38:18.182
you were a member of
the Rushmore Beekeepers, weren't you?

38:18.306 --> 38:20.934
Yeah. I was president of them.

38:21.141 --> 38:22.935
He founded that club.

38:30.609 --> 38:33.236
Do you think we can be
friends again, Miss Cross?

38:34.111 --> 38:38.033
- In-In a strictly platonic way?
- Of course I do.

38:38.158 --> 38:42.120
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

38:42.954 --> 38:45.997
Yeah, but I need a tutor.

38:46.540 --> 38:52.086
<i># In the midnight moonlight
I'll #</i>

38:52.629 --> 38:56.800
<i># Be walking
a long and lonely mile #</i>

38:58.095 --> 39:02.139
<i># And every time I do #</i>

39:03.599 --> 39:08.394
<i># I keep seeing
this picture of you #</i>

39:08.560 --> 39:11.020

39:14.111 --> 39:17.238

as no surprise to me #</i>

39:17.321 --> 39:21.824
<i># With another guy
here comes my baby #</i>

39:22.116 --> 39:24.743
<i># Here she comes now #</i>

39:24.912 --> 39:28.123

With a love that's all so fine #</i>

39:28.290 --> 39:32.794
<i># Never could be mine

39:38.841 --> 39:41.926
<i># You never walk alone #</i>

39:42.010 --> 39:44.137
Fighting Owls, let's go!

39:44.220 --> 39:48.100
<i># And you're forever
talking on the phone #</i>

39:50.185 --> 39:53.855
<i>- # I try to call you names #

39:53.938 --> 39:59.276
<i>- Let's go!

<i>- # Here she comes now ##

40:04.906 --> 40:07.578
- Alan's got the birds for your approval.
- I'll take the green one.

40:07.703 --> 40:10.038
- And here's the knife.
- That's too fake.

40:10.163 --> 40:12.290
- Hi, Max.
- Hello.

40:15.292 --> 40:16.460
What's your name again?

40:16.544 --> 40:18.462
- Margaret Yang.
- Margaret Yang.

40:18.545 --> 40:20.465
What are you doing seventh period,
Margaret Yang?

40:20.548 --> 40:23.633
- I have guitar lessons.
- Classical guitar or... In what school?

40:23.716 --> 40:26.971
- Rock. - Ro... That's good.
We can get you out of that.

40:27.431 --> 40:29.473
Could I see you without
your glasses on, please?

40:31.476 --> 40:33.727
Let's put Margaret down for 3:30
in the auditorium, Woody.

40:33.894 --> 40:35.813
Thank you.

40:36.188 --> 40:37.980
And-And bring
a head shot, please.

40:50.035 --> 40:51.912
Hello, Herman.

40:52.037 --> 40:54.497
- How are you, Rosemary?
- I'm fine, thanks.

40:54.580 --> 40:58.916
I just got home,
and I'm having a little snack.

41:00.046 --> 41:03.299
- Having some carrots?
- Yeah.

41:05.050 --> 41:06.843
Nice house.

41:07.009 --> 41:12.014
Yeah. Um, it isn't mine.
I'm just sort of house-sitting.

41:14.518 --> 41:17.061
Um... you were
in the neighborhood?

41:18.188 --> 41:21.023
Uh... did Max have something
planned for us today?

41:21.190 --> 41:23.985
A trip to the museum
or something?

41:24.110 --> 41:27.822
No, I don't think so.
I think he's rehearsing tonight.

41:27.989 --> 41:30.574
Oh, that's right.
He's doing his new play.

41:30.740 --> 41:33.368
Yeah, he's really making a go of it
over there at Grover Cleveland.

41:33.493 --> 41:36.079
Yeah, he's doing very well,
isn't he?

41:39.040 --> 41:41.461
Do you want a carrot?

41:42.335 --> 41:44.046
Yeah, I'll have one of those.

41:45.672 --> 41:47.840
Thank you.

41:58.477 --> 42:01.352
Well, I'll probably
be seeing you soon.

42:04.814 --> 42:07.817
Or we could go for a walk now,
if you like.

42:18.287 --> 42:20.080
Sure.

42:20.288 --> 42:23.415
The weather's nice, isn't it?

42:23.540 --> 42:26.126
A little brisk.

42:26.210 --> 42:29.462
I'll just get a sweater.
I'll be back in a minute.

43:01.035 --> 43:02.580
Dirk?

43:03.081 --> 43:05.749
I know about you
and the teacher.

43:15.717 --> 43:20.262
- Does Max know?
- No, and I don't want him to know, ever.

43:20.345 --> 43:23.390
I just want it
to stop right now.

43:23.557 --> 43:25.727
You're a married man, Blume,

43:25.853 --> 43:28.147
and you're supposed
to be his friend.

43:28.271 --> 43:31.023
Look, Dirk, I am his friend.

43:31.107 --> 43:33.943
Oh, yeah. And with friends
like you, who needs friends?

43:47.916 --> 43:49.459
Unlock it!

43:53.669 --> 43:55.963
Little Calloway.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.638
You're standing up
for the wrong guy.

44:03.763 --> 44:05.641
Fischer ain't your mate.

44:05.766 --> 44:07.602
What are you talking about, Buchan?

44:07.727 --> 44:09.727
He thinks your mom's good for a bonk.

44:09.852 --> 44:12.729
That's the only reason he picked you
as his chapel partner.

44:12.854 --> 44:16.192
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself.

44:16.317 --> 44:20.404
He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.

44:22.739 --> 44:25.910
- Max would never say that.
- Yeah.

44:25.993 --> 44:27.913
I suppose you're right.

44:27.995 --> 44:32.540
After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't
need to impress anybody now, does he?

44:34.166 --> 44:37.507
The killing's gotta stop, esse.
It's getting too loco.

44:37.673 --> 44:39.965
- No more gats.
- Nigger, you're the crazy one.

44:40.090 --> 44:42.009
People be trying to kill you.
Are you talkin'...

44:42.010 --> 44:43.928
...about you're gonna get rid of your gun?

44:45.971 --> 44:47.680
It's time, homey.

44:47.847 --> 44:49.432
Kiss me, Little Juan.

44:49.516 --> 44:51.894
All right, then he kisses her
and we're out. Okay.

44:52.019 --> 44:53.603
Is that for me?

44:53.770 --> 44:57.275
<i>Dear Max, I am sorry to say
that I have secretly found out...</i>

44:57.359 --> 45:00.277
<i>that Mr. Blume is having
an affair with Miss Cross.</i>

45:00.361 --> 45:03.239
<i>My first suspicions came when I saw them
Frenching in front of her house,</i>

45:03.321 --> 45:06.573
<i>and then I knew for sure when they went
skinny-dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool,</i>

45:06.657 --> 45:10.953
<i>giving each other hand jobs while you
were taking a nap on the front porch.</i>

45:11.120 --> 45:13.330
<i>Why am I telling you this now?</i>

45:13.497 --> 45:16.042
<i>Because you're such a good friend.</i>

45:16.209 --> 45:17.709
<i>Take care, pal.</i>

45:17.793 --> 45:20.964
<i>Fondly, Dirk Calloway.</i>

45:23.257 --> 45:24.759
God.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.719
How was she, Herman?

45:29.470 --> 45:31.054
Jesus Christ.

45:31.721 --> 45:33.726
Was she good?
I bet she was.

45:33.810 --> 45:36.729
Although, I wouldn't know
because I never screwed her.

45:38.647 --> 45:41.316
Going skinny-dipping
while I took a nap.

45:41.440 --> 45:44.527
"Are you comfortable, Max?
I'll just, uh, be out back, nude,

45:44.610 --> 45:47.030
getting hand jobs
from the woman you love. "

45:47.156 --> 45:49.739
We never went skinny-dipping.

45:49.823 --> 45:52.327
Sure, you didn't.
And next you're gonna tell me...

45:52.411 --> 45:55.414
you didn't just walk out of her house
at 2:00 in the morning.

45:58.667 --> 46:00.916
I'm in love with her.

46:03.544 --> 46:05.921
Well, I was in love
with her first.

46:07.924 --> 46:12.261
And all that crap about,
"I don't think she's that great.

46:12.386 --> 46:14.055
I don't think she's right
for you, Max. "

46:14.139 --> 46:16.559
That was all bullshit,
wasn't it?

46:18.478 --> 46:20.728
Do you think
she's in love with you?

46:22.937 --> 46:24.939
I don't know.

46:25.607 --> 46:29.238
Well, I guarantee you she's not,
and she never will be.

46:31.573 --> 46:33.073
Max.

46:36.327 --> 46:38.079
I saved Latin.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.417
What did you ever do?

46:46.339 --> 46:48.424
On the planet I come from...

46:48.508 --> 46:51.009
the sun only comes out once a year.

46:51.134 --> 46:53.093
<i># From a tiny piece of colored glass #</i>

46:53.177 --> 46:55.094
- That is why my skin...
- Excuse me.

46:55.178 --> 46:56.847
<i>- # My love was born #
- Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

46:56.931 --> 46:59.641
I just came by to thank you
for wrecking my life.

47:00.265 --> 47:03.938
<i># And reds and golds and yellows #</i>

47:04.021 --> 47:07.109
<i>- # Were the colors in the dawn #
- Max, what are you doing?</i>

47:10.069 --> 47:13.030
<i># Night brought on
its purple cloak #</i>

47:13.072 --> 47:16.032
<i># Of velvet to the sky #</i>

47:16.740 --> 47:20.622
<i># And the gulls
were wheeling, spinning #</i>

47:20.914 --> 47:23.458
<i>- # On Jersey Thursday ##
- Hello, Mrs. Blume.</i>

47:23.542 --> 47:27.502
<i>This is Max Fischer. I have some
information regarding your husband.</i>

47:27.585 --> 47:31.840
<i>Please return my call on my voice mail:
Grover Cleveland High School, extension 23.</i>

47:31.923 --> 47:33.715
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

47:37.387 --> 47:39.682
Thank you for meeting me.

47:40.683 --> 47:41.975
You're welcome.

47:43.726 --> 47:46.230
Would you like a sandwich?

47:47.897 --> 47:49.814
All right.

47:51.733 --> 47:56.488
I have a tuna
and peanut butter and jelly.

47:56.572 --> 47:58.491
Sorry it's not
something more exotic.

47:58.575 --> 48:01.327
- I'll take the tuna fish.
- Okay.

48:02.786 --> 48:04.747
Milk or apple juice?

48:04.873 --> 48:06.915
Get to the point.

48:08.749 --> 48:10.709
Okay.

48:11.292 --> 48:14.879
Your husband's...

48:22.512 --> 48:24.265
- How long will you be
staying with us, Mr. Blume?

48:24.266 --> 48:26.017
Indefinitely.

48:26.100 --> 48:28.687
- I'm being sued for divorce.
- Very good, sir.

48:28.812 --> 48:30.812
Yo, shorty.

48:31.313 --> 48:33.024
Say, can you tell me
where the pool is located?

48:33.107 --> 48:35.735
I might want to take a dip
after I have dinner and hit the bar.

48:35.777 --> 48:37.571
It's on the roof, sir.

49:37.670 --> 49:40.712
<i># Can't believe it #</i>

49:40.796 --> 49:44.091
<i># Do my eyes deceive me #</i>

49:44.591 --> 49:48.097
<i># Am I back in your arms #</i>

49:48.347 --> 49:50.474
<i># Away from all harm #</i>

49:51.975 --> 49:55.896

49:56.063 --> 49:58.314
<i># Again #</i>

49:59.232 --> 50:03.234

50:03.317 --> 50:05.239
<i># Again #</i>

50:15.289 --> 50:16.956

50:17.039 --> 50:20.626

50:20.793 --> 50:22.588
<i># You are forgiven #</i>

50:22.755 --> 50:30.136

50:30.303 --> 50:32.637

50:32.804 --> 50:39.020
<i># Forgiven, forgiven Forgiven,

50:40.938 --> 50:43.064
<i># Know you're forgiven #</i>

50:44.443 --> 50:47.905
<i># Come on, baby #</i>

50:48.113 --> 50:50.823
<i># Know that you are #</i>

50:51.364 --> 50:53.784
<i># Know you're forgiven #</i>

50:55.075 --> 50:58.458

<i># Baby #</i>

51:11.133 --> 51:14.971
<i># You are forgiven #</i>

51:15.055 --> 51:19.434
He's about five foot three,
112 pounds,

51:19.476 --> 51:23.523
black hair, glasses, oval face.

51:25.607 --> 51:28.276
<i># You know you're forgiven #</i>

51:28.443 --> 51:31.362

<i># Know you're forgiven ##</i>

51:39.621 --> 51:42.207
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad.
Can you drop me off at Rushmore?

51:42.249 --> 51:45.626
- I gotta go get a teacher fired.
- I don't think that's wise, Max.

51:57.639 --> 51:59.556
Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

51:59.639 --> 52:01.266
- This is private property!
You're trespassing!

52:01.267 --> 52:02.892
What, are you crazy?

52:06.022 --> 52:06.940
Wait a minute!

52:08.232 --> 52:09.275
Stop!

52:09.358 --> 52:14.156
- Let's have a truce for a second.
- Wait! Truce! Truce!

52:23.579 --> 52:25.497
What's this all about?

52:27.248 --> 52:29.543
Did you say my mom
gave you a hand job?

52:29.668 --> 52:31.919
- What?
- Did you say it?

52:32.044 --> 52:34.840
Who told you
that goddamn lie?

52:35.007 --> 52:37.010
Never mind.
I know who said it.

52:37.177 --> 52:38.553
I think I'm gonna stick
a knife in his heart,

52:38.636 --> 52:40.803
then I'm gonna send him back to Ireland
in a body bag.

52:40.928 --> 52:42.513
He's from Scotland.

52:42.637 --> 52:46.854
Well, tell that stupid Mick he just
made my list of things to do today.

52:47.855 --> 52:50.523
I'm gonna pop a cap in his ass.

52:52.608 --> 52:55.861
So you received the package?

52:56.028 --> 52:57.613
Good.

52:57.780 --> 53:01.033
I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on.

53:04.118 --> 53:06.706
I never took you
for an informer, Max.

53:07.456 --> 53:09.375
What's that supposed to mean?

53:09.625 --> 53:11.710
"What's that supposed to mean?"

53:15.837 --> 53:19.216
She resigned this morning before
I even got your little snapshots.

53:19.342 --> 53:21.425
So your latest attempt
at sabotage backfired.

53:21.550 --> 53:24.347
But she's one of the best teachers
you've got. How could you let her go?

53:24.388 --> 53:27.015
- Why are you trying to get her fired?
- You stupid old fool!

53:27.099 --> 53:29.310
I'm trying to win her back!

53:46.244 --> 53:48.036
Miss Cross?

53:48.620 --> 53:50.038
Hi, Max.

53:55.253 --> 53:57.712
- Need any help?
- No, I have it.

53:59.798 --> 54:02.009
Oh, here, let me see.

54:02.010 --> 54:04.219
- No. Please. Look, I don't
think you should come in here.

54:05.262 --> 54:08.849
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

54:09.433 --> 54:12.892
I'm sorry I love your friend
instead of you, but...

54:12.934 --> 54:15.019
Please, Max...

54:15.020 --> 54:17.106
- You honestly believe you
love Blume instead of me?

54:17.231 --> 54:19.067
Yes.

54:19.276 --> 54:21.317
Well, you'll have to forgive me
if I don't take your word for that.

54:21.401 --> 54:23.029
- Oh, stop.
- Miss Cross...

54:23.113 --> 54:26.206
- Listen, if you don't stop, I'm
gonna lose it. I mean it! Don't...

54:26.307 --> 54:29.700
It's too late.

54:33.912 --> 54:35.917
Wait. Please.

54:41.588 --> 54:43.297
I got kicked out
because of you.

54:43.422 --> 54:46.801
- No, you got kicked out...
- Rushmore was my life.

54:46.926 --> 54:50.180
- Now you are.
- No, I'm not.

54:52.097 --> 54:55.478
What do you really think
is gonna happen between us?

54:56.019 --> 54:58.605
Do you think
we're gonna have sex?

55:01.315 --> 55:04.275
That's a kind
of cheap way to put it.

55:04.442 --> 55:06.819
Not if you've ever
fucked before, it isn't.

55:09.447 --> 55:11.743
Oh, my God.

55:11.826 --> 55:15.286
How would you describe it
to your friends?

55:15.369 --> 55:17.581
Would you say
that you'd fingered me?

55:17.664 --> 55:21.209
Or maybe I could give you a hand job.
Would that put an end to all of this?

55:23.419 --> 55:26.171
Please get out of my classroom.

55:35.057 --> 55:37.935
Fresh are you, sporty, me fuckup.

55:38.060 --> 55:39.477
Hey, Magnus.

55:39.602 --> 55:42.479
Got any good hand jobs lately?

55:47.945 --> 55:49.614
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here.

55:49.696 --> 55:53.491
It's your stepfather, waiting
for your mom so that he can get a piece.

55:55.743 --> 55:58.829
Your mind's as warped
as your ear, Buchan.

56:03.625 --> 56:06.213
Don't get nasty, brother.

56:23.852 --> 56:29.193
We got him, Dirk.
We got him.

56:45.207 --> 56:46.501
Max?

56:47.835 --> 56:49.879
Oh, hey, Mr. Blume.

56:53.547 --> 56:55.507
You said you wanted to meet?

56:57.177 --> 56:59.094
W- When?

57:00.220 --> 57:01.055
Right now.

57:01.181 --> 57:04.266
You said you wanted
to put an end to all this.

57:04.767 --> 57:10.272
Oh, yeah. I, uh, was gonna try and
have that tree over there fall on you.

57:10.440 --> 57:13.609
- That big one?
- Yup.

57:13.650 --> 57:15.944
It would have flattened me
like a pancake.

57:16.695 --> 57:17.945
What stopped you?

57:18.992 --> 57:21.660
I don't know.
What's the point?

57:21.827 --> 57:23.828
She loves you.

57:38.803 --> 57:40.762
She's my Rushmore, Max.

57:41.845 --> 57:45.057
Yeah, I know.
She was mine too.

It's been nice having
your company here at the shop, Max.

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:24.045
You put any more thought...

01:00:24.129 --> 01:00:27.298
- into giving school another shot?
- No.

01:00:29.007 --> 01:00:33.552
Max, I like being a barber.
I'm good at it.

01:00:33.635 --> 01:00:36.805
But I always thought
you'd try another line of work.

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:40.893
You talked about being
a senator or a diplomat.

01:00:41.017 --> 01:00:43.313
Pipe dreams, Dad.

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:45.606
I'm a barber's son.

01:00:50.651 --> 01:00:52.610
See you at dinner.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.384
Hello, Dirk.

01:01:14.551 --> 01:01:17.722
- Hi, Max.
- What can I do for you?

01:01:17.889 --> 01:01:21.349
- I thought I might get a haircut.
- We're closed.

01:01:22.308 --> 01:01:26.228
Well, I just want to say
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you that day.

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:28.689
But I guess I'll go now.

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:39.408
Merry Christmas.

01:01:39.534 --> 01:01:41.451
What in the hell's that?

01:01:58.969 --> 01:02:01.679
So, did you hear the news?

01:02:01.846 --> 01:02:05.725
I doubt it. I don't really
follow the news anymore.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.102
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.

01:02:09.356 --> 01:02:12.525
I'll send him a box of candy.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.528
Maybe you ought to go visit him.

01:02:23.409 --> 01:02:27.872
- Mrs. Guggenheim?
- Hello, Max. Come in.

01:02:33.043 --> 01:02:35.462
It's so good to see you.

01:02:38.132 --> 01:02:41.383
Oh, these are glorious.
I'll put them in some water.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.593
Have a seat.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.975
Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim
or can he not hear me?

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.935
No, he can hear you.

01:02:56.149 --> 01:03:00.736
Hey, old-timer.
It's, uh, Max Fischer.

01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:05.366
You probably can't hear me because...

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:07.034
- I don't know if your
brain is damaged or...

01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:08.619
What do you want?

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.958
Nelson?

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:23.049
That's the first thing
he's said in ten days.

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:26.970
Do you think he recognized me?

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:31.349
- Oh, I don't think so.
- It's Fischer.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.534
See ya later. Bye.
Hope you feel better.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:54.705
Hey, amigo.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:00.128
So, who gave you the shiner?

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:03.507
Either Ronny or Donny.

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:05.382
Can't tell the difference anymore.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.345
Well, whichever one it was
really clocked you.

01:04:09.386 --> 01:04:10.844
Hmm.

01:04:11.428 --> 01:04:14.306
Kids don't like it when
their parents get divorced.

01:04:14.432 --> 01:04:18.062
- I don't blame 'em.
- Neither do I.

01:04:32.573 --> 01:04:34.745
How is she?

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:36.873
I really wouldn't know.

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:40.416
- Why not?
- I haven't seen her in six weeks.

01:04:40.582 --> 01:04:42.460
What happened?

01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:45.629
She left?

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:48.967
She's in love
with a dead guy anyway.

01:04:50.592 --> 01:04:52.721
Edward Appleby.

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.599
You know, uh...

01:04:58.143 --> 01:05:00.560
she's sweet, but she's fucked-up.

01:05:04.564 --> 01:05:08.066
- Adios, muchacho.
- Hey, are you okay?

01:05:09.779 --> 01:05:12.697
Mmm, I'm a little bit
lonely these days.

01:05:45.478 --> 01:05:47.524
Max?

01:05:48.232 --> 01:05:49.943
What are you doing here?

01:05:51.526 --> 01:05:54.071
I don't know. Jesus.
They came at me out of nowhere.

01:05:54.154 --> 01:05:56.697
- It was... It was so sudden.
- What?

01:05:57.073 --> 01:05:59.033
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?

01:05:59.075 --> 01:06:03.079
- I just got hit by a car.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:06:03.245 --> 01:06:04.915
Hmm? What did you say?

01:06:04.956 --> 01:06:07.084
- Come inside.
- Thank you.

01:06:09.796 --> 01:06:12.963
- I'm gonna get something for your head.
- Okay.

01:06:19.344 --> 01:06:21.345
So, this is where it all happens.

01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:24.518
- All what happens?
- I wouldn't know.

01:06:24.643 --> 01:06:27.229
So, why did you dump Blume?

01:06:27.938 --> 01:06:32.565
- That's none of your business.
- I know it's not.

01:06:32.732 --> 01:06:35.568
But I just got hit by a car,
and I'm a little confused right now.

01:06:35.652 --> 01:06:37.213
I mean, I thought
you dumped me for Blume.

01:06:37.248 --> 01:06:38.136
Then I hear...

01:06:38.137 --> 01:06:40.616
- I never dumped you because
we were never going out.

01:06:40.783 --> 01:06:43.702
It would just help me
if you talked to me for a minute.

01:06:43.828 --> 01:06:45.663
Tell me what happened.

01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:50.376
Okay.

01:06:53.336 --> 01:06:57.047
Um, A: He's married.

01:06:57.799 --> 01:07:00.927
He hates himself.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:05.055
And C: Well,
he smashed up your bicycle,

01:07:05.139 --> 01:07:09.102
- didn't he?
- My previous bicycle, yes.

01:07:09.185 --> 01:07:11.868
- Well, what sort of person
does something like that?

01:07:11.869 --> 01:07:13.353
I don't know.

01:07:16.694 --> 01:07:19.530
War does funny things to men.

01:07:19.697 --> 01:07:23.781
He thinks you dumped him
because of Edward Appleby.

01:07:26.033 --> 01:07:27.995
What does that mean?

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:34.877
Well, I mean, you live in his room,
with all his stuff. It's kind of...

01:07:37.379 --> 01:07:39.299
I was married to him.

01:07:40.299 --> 01:07:43.009
- I know you were.
- Although, I will say...

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:48.013
that Edward has more
spark and character...

01:07:48.138 --> 01:07:50.058
and imagination
in one fingernail...

01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:53.062
than Herman Blume
has in his entire body.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.441
One dead fingernail.

01:08:01.902 --> 01:08:03.780
Right.

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.822
One dead fingernail.

01:08:10.326 --> 01:08:12.622
How did he die, by the way?

01:08:13.749 --> 01:08:15.333
He drowned.

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:19.295
How did your mother die?

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.670
She got cancer.

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:29.764
Hold still for a moment, okay?

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.979
You're very pretty.

01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:41.357
Thank you.

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:05.216
Is this fake blood?

01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:10.386
Yes, it is.

01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:14.180
You know, you and Herman
deserve each other.

01:09:15.264 --> 01:09:17.433
You're both little children.

01:09:19.687 --> 01:09:21.729
Let me show you the door.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.899
I'll just go back out the window.

01:09:39.828 --> 01:09:42.791
- Good-bye, Miss Cross.
- Good-bye, Max.

01:10:00.934 --> 01:10:02.353
Hey.

01:10:02.896 --> 01:10:06.814
I'm, uh... I'm sorry
about what I said...

01:10:06.856 --> 01:10:09.233
about your mom
giving me a hand job.

01:10:10.193 --> 01:10:12.360
I know, Max.

01:10:12.444 --> 01:10:16.074
I'm sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass.

01:10:17.282 --> 01:10:19.162
Hey, uh, that's okay.

01:10:25.167 --> 01:10:27.168
What's that?

01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:31.754
I don't know.

01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:47.896
Nice landing.

01:10:51.857 --> 01:10:55.488
What's, uh... What's that you got there,
a little flight plan or something?

01:10:55.571 --> 01:10:57.533
Hmm, pretty good.

01:10:57.658 --> 01:11:00.076
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so.

01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:03.078
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.

01:11:11.168 --> 01:11:15.298
I, uh, heard about your science project
on Action 13.

01:11:15.382 --> 01:11:17.304
- They said the Navy wants
to buy it from you. That's...

01:11:17.305 --> 01:11:18.427
No, not anymore.

01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:21.886
- Why not?
- Because it was a fake.

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:25.180
- What do you mean?
- I faked all the results.

01:11:25.264 --> 01:11:27.933
- Why?
- Because it didn't work.

01:11:28.016 --> 01:11:30.147
I thought it would,
but it didn't.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.988
You're a real jerk to me,
you know that?

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.741
I'm sorry, Margaret.

01:11:45.283 --> 01:11:48.244
Well, anyway, nice to see you.

01:12:09.309 --> 01:12:11.852
Do you want to take over for a while?

01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:38.835
Take dictation, please.

01:12:41.129 --> 01:12:45.010

I got those at Rushmore.

01:13:52.449 --> 01:13:54.325
I thought you could choose
which one you like more...

01:13:54.409 --> 01:13:57.663
and you could wear that one,
and I could wear the other.

Okay.

01:14:06.503 --> 01:14:08.089
Come here.

01:14:17.097 --> 01:14:20.811
- Thank you.
- Come on inside.

01:14:24.813 --> 01:14:27.940
Well, well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

01:14:29.401 --> 01:14:31.026
Sorry I'm late.

01:14:31.193 --> 01:14:32.864
That's okay.

01:14:33.031 --> 01:14:34.825
I want you to meet someone.

01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:38.327
Mr. Blume,
this is my father, Bert Fischer.

01:14:41.704 --> 01:14:43.790
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Fischer.

01:14:43.915 --> 01:14:47.336
Now Mr. Fischer was my father's name.
Call me Bert, please.

01:14:47.461 --> 01:14:51.091
- Okay, Bert.
- So, Max tells me you need a haircut.

01:14:51.216 --> 01:14:54.468
I can see that. Why don't you sit down,
and we'll have a look.

01:14:58.889 --> 01:15:00.598
Mm-hmm.

01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:05.811
I don't know, Bert.

01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:10.025
Don't worry, Mr. Blume.
It's a relatively painless procedure.

01:15:10.192 --> 01:15:12.694
Maybe we'll throw in
a shave as well.

01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:16.739
Okay, are you fond
of that mustache?

01:15:16.989 --> 01:15:20.951
Do you think you want to keep it
for a while? Mm-hmm.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.870
- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know.

01:15:24.995 --> 01:15:27.167
- Over ten million?
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:15:27.334 --> 01:15:29.044
- Good, good.
- Why?

01:15:29.128 --> 01:15:31.211
'Cause we're gonna
need all of it.

01:16:40.654 --> 01:16:42.823
She's not coming, is she?

01:16:43.573 --> 01:16:46.576
Hmm, doesn't look good.

01:16:46.701 --> 01:16:48.786
But don't worry. Come on, Herman.

01:16:48.911 --> 01:16:51.871
- Shit, what am I doing here?
- Hey!

01:16:51.996 --> 01:16:54.582
- Scatter. Scatter.
- Damn it!

01:16:54.707 --> 01:16:58.880
How in the hell did you ever
get so rich? You're a quitter, man!

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:01.716
I paid $8 million for this.

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:06.429
And that's all
you're prepared to spend?

01:17:15.689 --> 01:17:19.651
I'm, uh, sorry you couldn't make it to
our little groundbreaking the other day.

01:17:20.276 --> 01:17:23.487
It's kind of a shame,
since he's building it for you.

01:17:23.654 --> 01:17:28.034
Well, you know, I never asked anyone
to build me an aquarium.

01:17:28.576 --> 01:17:31.494
I'm not quite sure
how that rumor got started.

01:17:31.577 --> 01:17:33.748
Me neither.

01:17:34.332 --> 01:17:37.959
You think Edward Appleby
would have built one for you?

01:17:38.334 --> 01:17:41.211
Yeah, I think he would have,
if he'd had the money.

01:17:41.336 --> 01:17:43.212
That's what I thought.

01:17:43.337 --> 01:17:47.050
Blume's got a bit more spark and
vitality than you expected, doesn't he?

01:17:47.175 --> 01:17:50.429
I thought the aquarium
was your idea.

01:17:51.304 --> 01:17:53.390
Well, I gave it to my friend.

01:17:54.348 --> 01:17:56.102
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please.

01:17:56.227 --> 01:17:59.938
And... could you make
the order out to...

01:18:00.021 --> 01:18:02.314
Ready Demolition,
Tucson, Arizona?

01:18:04.024 --> 01:18:06.110
Thank you very much.

01:18:10.616 --> 01:18:12.535
Make sure these don't get wet.

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:17.330
I'll see you at 3:15.

01:18:17.372 --> 01:18:19.331
- Where are you going?
- Rushmore.

01:18:19.373 --> 01:18:22.333
I've got one last piece
of unfinished business to attend to.

01:18:38.641 --> 01:18:42.103
- Fischer, you fuck!
- Hello, Magnus.

01:18:42.187 --> 01:18:43.437
I'd have shot you
in the other ear,

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.484
but it got blown off
a long time ago.

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:51.446
- Besides, now we're even.
- Not for long, Kemo Sabe.

01:18:51.613 --> 01:18:54.908
We'll see. I got
a proposition for you.

01:18:55.034 --> 01:18:58.787
Well, you can stick it up
your mother's ass, you little prick.

01:18:58.953 --> 01:19:00.872
I gotta hand it to you, Magnus.

01:19:00.997 --> 01:19:03.210
You've got a way with words.

01:19:03.377 --> 01:19:05.169
You want to be in a play?

01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:09.715
What's all that shite?

01:19:11.841 --> 01:19:13.717
Nothing.

01:19:14.386 --> 01:19:16.470
I just think
you're right for the part.

01:19:33.487 --> 01:19:36.865
I always wanted to be
in one of your fucking plays.

01:19:38.157 --> 01:19:40.537
I know you did, mate.

01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:55.298
This is gonna be exciting.
My son Max wrote it.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:58.179
Oh, boy, I gotta call the hospital.

01:19:58.887 --> 01:20:01.390
Excuse me. Are you
Mrs. Whitney, the English teacher?

01:20:01.432 --> 01:20:04.307
- Yes. - Hi, I'm William Yang,
Margaret Yang's father.

01:20:04.391 --> 01:20:06.310
- This is my wife, Lucille.
- Nice to meet you.

01:20:06.394 --> 01:20:08.438
- Hello.
- That's kid's gonna burn this place down.

01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:10.377
You better believe it.

01:20:10.378 --> 01:20:12.233
- Well, the plans were never
formally submitted to the city.

01:20:12.358 --> 01:20:14.609
- Were they supposed to be?
- I assume so.

01:20:14.735 --> 01:20:16.780
<i>- Too late now.
- Officers Brooks and Donovan...</i>

01:20:16.864 --> 01:20:19.283
<i>requesting additional units
at Grover Cleveland High School.</i>

01:20:19.366 --> 01:20:21.117
<i>- Units responding identify.
- A program.</i>

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.037
Let me look at that.
Turn it, turn it.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.038
That's enough.

01:20:29.290 --> 01:20:32.042
- Excuse me. Right here.
- Thanks.

01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:37.923
Hi, Herman.

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:44.222
Looks like Max
pulled a fast one on us.

01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:54.191
Thank you very much.

01:20:54.817 --> 01:20:58.861
I don't usually do this,
but this play means a lot to me,

01:20:58.944 --> 01:21:01.198
and I wanted
to make a dedication.

01:21:01.281 --> 01:21:04.949
So, I'll just say that this play
is dedicated to the memory of my mother,

01:21:04.991 --> 01:21:07.370
Eloise Fischer,

01:21:08.079 --> 01:21:11.250
and to Edward Appleby,
a friend of a friend.

01:21:12.333 --> 01:21:14.961
Also, you'll find a pair
of safety glasses and some earplugs...

01:21:15.002 --> 01:21:16.963
underneath your seats.

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:20.632
Please feel free to use them.
Thank you very much.

01:21:27.305 --> 01:21:29.392
<i>Bravo Company, this is Tango 7.
Do you copy?</i>

01:21:29.475 --> 01:21:33.145
We order the military forces
of the United States to take action...

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.773
This is a different kind of war.

01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:39.193
We are making progress,
progress, progress, progress.

01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:52.913
How long you been
in country, soldier?

01:21:53.037 --> 01:21:55.249
I ain't even here, Sergeant.

01:21:55.374 --> 01:21:57.334
I'm in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

01:21:58.626 --> 01:22:00.004
Right on, brother.

01:22:02.171 --> 01:22:04.297
Hoo. Hoo-hoo.

01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:09.930
Let's rock, Esposito!
I repeat, let's rock!

01:22:11.849 --> 01:22:13.683
Let's rock and roll!

01:22:47.674 --> 01:22:49.427
Fischer!

01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:54.223
I'm okay. Go, go, go, go.

01:22:54.891 --> 01:22:56.725
- Damn it!
- Take it easy, Dirk.

01:22:56.767 --> 01:22:58.895
- How much time do we got, Wood?
- Two minutes.

01:22:58.936 --> 01:23:00.209
- All right, bring me some more
ketchup very quickly, please.

01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:01.480
Effects!

01:23:01.563 --> 01:23:04.941
- This is gonna look stupid.
- No, it's not. It's gonna look real.

01:23:22.167 --> 01:23:25.379
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:23:25.836 --> 01:23:27.881
Hold this one too, okay?

01:23:31.299 --> 01:23:35.556
So, what do you think
of Max's latest opus?

01:23:36.932 --> 01:23:38.851
It's good.

01:23:41.436 --> 01:23:44.438
But let's hope
it's got a happy ending.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:06.666
- Adios, Esposito.
- Adios, Sarge.

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:10.671
Say a prayer for Surf Boy,
wherever he is.

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:14.716
Semper fi, soldier.
Semper fi.

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:17.261
Sic transit gloria.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:20.222
Maybe we'll meet again someday...

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.349
when the fighting stops.

01:24:25.184 --> 01:24:28.186
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries!
We're movin' out!

01:24:30.276 --> 01:24:32.027
I don't know but I've been told

01:24:32.193 --> 01:24:34.486
I don't know but I've been told

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:45.621
Hello, Esposito.

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:52.379
Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.715
You bet I will.

01:25:09.561 --> 01:25:13.316
That's my son.
That's my Maxie.

01:25:21.906 --> 01:25:24.787
I just didn't expect to see you here.

01:25:25.036 --> 01:25:26.830
Did Max send you an invitation?

01:25:26.914 --> 01:25:30.291
Yeah, and he told me to wear a tie.

01:25:32.084 --> 01:25:36.337
- Congratulations, Max.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Yang.

01:25:36.462 --> 01:25:39.716
I, uh, actually wrote a different
version of the play two years ago,

01:25:39.841 --> 01:25:41.633
but I couldn't
get it done over at Rushmore.

01:25:41.758 --> 01:25:43.930
- Oh, really? Why?
- Too political?

01:25:43.971 --> 01:25:46.932
No, a kid got his finger blown off
during rehearsals.

01:25:47.015 --> 01:25:49.935
A very good evening
to you, Fischers. Hi.

01:25:50.018 --> 01:25:52.477
Miss Cross, I'd like for you
to meet my father, Bert Fischer.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.647
He's a barber.
This is my friend, Rosemary Cross.

01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:58.900
- Hello, Rosemary.
- Nice to meet you at last, Bert.

01:25:59.026 --> 01:26:00.487
Of course you know Mr. Blume.

01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:04.865
I'd also like everyone to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Yang. This is Margaret.

01:26:04.949 --> 01:26:07.702
- Hello, Margaret.
- It's nice to meet you, Miss Cross.

01:26:07.785 --> 01:26:09.995
I'm surprised they let him build
a real campfire on the stage.

01:26:10.079 --> 01:26:11.995
It's clearly a safety hazard.

01:26:12.079 --> 01:26:13.788
- Well, last year, he
tried to raise piranhas.

01:26:13.789 --> 01:26:15.499
Yeah, I know he did.

01:26:15.582 --> 01:26:18.755
- What did you think, Mr. Littlejeans?
- Best play ever, man.

01:26:21.299 --> 01:26:23.258
I thought it was
a very realistic performance.

01:26:23.299 --> 01:26:26.302
Yeah? Fischer stepped
over half my bloody lines.

01:26:26.386 --> 01:26:28.345
That's funny.
I didn't notice.

01:26:28.429 --> 01:26:30.973
Mr. Blume, how are Ronny and Donny
enjoying military school?

01:26:31.056 --> 01:26:33.642
- They love it.
- Lucky bastards.

01:26:34.351 --> 01:26:38.399
- I understand you're a neurosurgeon.
- No, I'm a barber.

01:26:38.481 --> 01:26:41.276
But a lot of people make that mistake.

01:26:46.321 --> 01:26:48.615
You were incredible tonight, Margaret.

01:26:48.657 --> 01:26:51.868
- You were that poor girl.
- Thank you.

01:26:51.951 --> 01:26:55.622
I loved it when you grabbed onto the
bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.

01:26:55.706 --> 01:26:57.665
- That was totally improvised.
- I know.

01:26:57.707 --> 01:26:59.669
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

01:26:59.711 --> 01:27:02.212
Can you do
an Australian accent?

01:27:02.296 --> 01:27:04.798
I'm working on something
that's set in the outback.

01:27:04.882 --> 01:27:07.842
I really feel like celebrating,
you know?

01:27:08.051 --> 01:27:11.761
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, yes, I would love to.

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:13.433
- Great.
- Come on.

01:27:13.974 --> 01:27:15.560
You're looking good, Bert.

01:27:15.643 --> 01:27:17.603
Hello, Mr. Blume.

01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.647
Hello, Margaret.
May I cut in?

01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:23.691
I haven't had a chance to cut a rug
with your new girlfriend yet.

01:27:23.733 --> 01:27:27.279
- Ah, new girlfriend.
- Yes, I am.

01:27:27.362 --> 01:27:31.283
Find your own dance partner, Mr. Blume.
I'm spoken for.

01:27:31.409 --> 01:27:35.204
No, it's okay.
He's my friend.

01:27:40.875 --> 01:27:44.085
Well... you pulled it off.

01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:47.505
Yeah, it went okay.
At least nobody got hurt.

01:27:49.759 --> 01:27:51.219
Except you.

01:27:53.179 --> 01:27:56.182
No, I didn't get hurt that bad.

01:27:56.391 --> 01:27:59.435
Come on, you two. Shake a leg.

01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:04.480
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, but...

01:28:04.563 --> 01:28:08.318
Here, let's see if the deejay can play
something with a little more... Reuben!

01:28:53.486 --> 01:28:56.447
