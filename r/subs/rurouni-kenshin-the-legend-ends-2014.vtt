00:25.900 --> 00:31.000
RUROUNI KENSHIN : THE LEGEND ENDS

01:01.000 --> 01:05.498
Why are you still here?

01:12.140 --> 01:18.499
I told you to get village help.

01:23.110 --> 01:33.990
All these can't be...

01:37.900 --> 01:41.610
ones I killed.

01:41.610 --> 01:46.999
Where are the bandits?

01:54.710 --> 02:00.380
The bandits got buried here?

02:00.380 --> 02:07.990
Everyone dead is just a body.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.770
Boy.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.240
Say your name.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.900
Shinta.

02:26.920 --> 02:35.900
It's too soft for a swordsman.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.580
You're now

02:43.580 --> 02:48.499
Kenshin.

02:51.870 --> 03:00.990
I'll teach you my sword style.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.950
This place...

03:36.410 --> 03:37.820
Kenshin!

03:37.820 --> 03:40.499
Battosai!

03:48.050 --> 03:53.990
Is that the legendary
Battosai's true strength?

04:00.580 --> 04:03.910
Kaoru-dono.

04:11.950 --> 04:16.990
You finally woke.

04:23.450 --> 04:26.990
Master.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.470
It's been a while,

04:31.470 --> 04:35.950
idiot disciple.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.950
You brought me here?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.170
After the storm,

04:44.170 --> 04:46.850
I went to find driftwood.

04:46.850 --> 04:50.600
Who knew I'd find you?

04:50.600 --> 04:54.920
Was anyone with me?

04:55.220 --> 04:58.120
Only that weird sword.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.620
You're sentimental?

05:01.620 --> 05:03.990
Which beach do I go?!

05:03.990 --> 05:07.990
It's useless!

05:09.940 --> 05:13.170
You slept 3 days.

05:13.170 --> 05:21.970
Nobody survives
3 days in the sea.

05:23.100 --> 05:27.990
Three days...

05:36.200 --> 05:39.200
What's that look?

05:39.200 --> 05:42.370
You haven't grown up.

05:42.370 --> 05:50.990
You carry the world's
burdens alone?

06:06.770 --> 06:11.800
I had a dream...

06:11.800 --> 06:17.999
about when we first met.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.830
Graves...

06:21.830 --> 06:27.990
I kept digging graves...

06:28.250 --> 06:33.490
a sea of bodies before me...

06:33.510 --> 06:39.500
I kept digging graves...

06:50.520 --> 06:53.380
Master.

06:53.380 --> 06:57.500
I need your help.

07:06.520 --> 07:16.400
Teach me Hiten Mitsurugi Ogi
(Flying Heaven Secret Technique).

07:17.020 --> 07:20.640
What?

07:20.640 --> 07:26.000
I have a foe I must defeat.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.350
Shishio Makoto, ex-hitokiri,
threatens this nation.

07:32.350 --> 07:40.950
If he gains control,
many will suffer.

07:42.870 --> 07:47.910
Ending Shishio is my mission!

07:47.910 --> 07:51.400
There's no time.

07:53.110 --> 07:57.900
I beg you.

08:02.780 --> 08:06.970
Alright.

08:07.270 --> 08:15.099
I may as well kill time.

08:16.180 --> 08:18.380
Idiot disciple,

08:18.400 --> 08:26.090
what did you do
the past 10 years?

08:29.170 --> 08:34.990
Wielding that weird sword...

08:39.000 --> 08:44.010
Show me!

08:54.230 --> 08:57.280
- Not bad. - These are bigger.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.120
These are nice.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.500
What's that?

09:00.500 --> 09:02.250
What's what?

09:02.250 --> 09:08.660
Can't you hear it?
It's like an earthquake.

09:17.550 --> 09:20.550
What's that?!

09:30.360 --> 09:33.500
We've got trouble...!

09:33.500 --> 09:35.000
We've got trouble...!

09:35.000 --> 09:36.130
What is it?

09:36.150 --> 09:38.310
A black ship...a black ship!

09:38.310 --> 09:42.100
What are you saying?
Were you daydreaming?

09:42.100 --> 09:44.080
Is it a foreign ship?

09:44.080 --> 09:49.180
Look for yourself!
The ship is like a monster!

09:57.580 --> 10:00.660
Run...run!

10:13.500 --> 10:15.940
TOKYO POLICE DEPARTMENT

10:16.020 --> 10:20.160
Can we get a foreign nation's
support?

10:20.160 --> 10:24.620
Identify the source, captain,
and ship's crew.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.890
Yes, sir.

10:26.940 --> 10:30.990
Could it be Shishio?

10:32.720 --> 10:38.070
25 years ago, Admiral Perry
who visited Japan, said,

10:38.070 --> 10:43.810
"Fear works better than friendly methods
in seeking a treaty."

10:43.810 --> 10:45.860
Sure.

10:45.940 --> 10:48.440
Hoji!

10:48.440 --> 10:50.650
Prepare to land.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.850
Understood!

10:53.350 --> 10:55.450
Time to take over the nation!

10:55.450 --> 10:59.970
Time to take over the nation!

11:07.700 --> 11:12.700
KYOTO

11:25.740 --> 11:27.770
Get a grip!

11:27.770 --> 11:30.780
Should you drink so early?

11:30.780 --> 11:33.880
Kenshin... Kaoru...

11:33.900 --> 11:38.990
what happened to them?

11:45.500 --> 11:48.180
Oi...were they killed...

11:48.180 --> 11:52.990
That won't happen!

12:33.300 --> 12:35.990
It's unforgivable.

12:46.940 --> 12:51.999
Shinomori Aoshi!

12:52.240 --> 13:00.000
He is now our enemy!

13:04.900 --> 13:07.230
What's that?

13:07.230 --> 13:10.420
Is that it?

13:10.420 --> 13:14.200
Hiten Mitsurugi is
an independent style

13:14.200 --> 13:18.020
only used to save
the suffering,

13:18.020 --> 13:22.080
not for power.

13:22.080 --> 13:31.100
But you defied my teaching
by working for the Government.

13:31.220 --> 13:37.100
For ego? Or ambition?

13:37.100 --> 13:40.080
Not ego nor ambition.

13:40.080 --> 13:48.900
I chose that way
to save the suffering.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.940
Who's this?

15:12.940 --> 15:19.990
This fisherman saw a scar-cheeked man
wash ashore.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.999
Is that true?

15:25.020 --> 15:27.900
Ye... yes...

15:27.980 --> 15:29.970
He's stubbornly alive.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.900
Where'd that man go?

15:38.650 --> 15:41.720
Tell me! Tell me now!

15:41.920 --> 15:45.200
It's fine, Hoji.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.520
I just had an idea...

15:47.520 --> 15:54.700
even more interesting
than ruling the nation.

15:54.700 --> 15:59.400
Shishio-sama...
What is it? What?!

16:17.700 --> 16:21.080
They won't be rash.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.620
Let's go!

16:22.620 --> 16:24.730
Yes, sir!

16:37.510 --> 16:39.390
Well, well...

16:39.390 --> 16:41.450
We've been waiting.

16:41.450 --> 16:44.760
Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi,

16:44.760 --> 16:48.140
it's a great honour.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.990
Please...

17:31.320 --> 17:35.020
Good food.

17:35.020 --> 17:41.900
I learned of this in my travels.

17:42.410 --> 17:46.500
It's not poisoned.

17:46.550 --> 17:52.990
You fought to end
the Shogunate, right?

17:54.670 --> 17:58.990
How many?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.300
How many did you kill
for your position?

18:02.300 --> 18:05.900
Bastard! How dare...?

18:08.620 --> 18:11.900
What are you doing?

18:13.440 --> 18:18.550
He mistook the use
of dining knives.

18:19.620 --> 18:23.095
Sit down!

18:28.210 --> 18:33.095
Back to your seats.

18:36.380 --> 18:44.620
Abe Naimushojo died of illness
on the way here.

18:44.620 --> 18:47.520
Report that news.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.990
Yes.

18:50.350 --> 18:54.810
That's your best trick.

18:54.810 --> 19:00.800
Burying stains on
the government.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.500
That's politics.

19:03.500 --> 19:08.900
So burning me was politics?

19:30.700 --> 19:34.999
There's nothing to discuss.

19:41.100 --> 19:45.050
I see...

19:45.050 --> 19:53.390
Due to politics, my sweat glands
were destroyed.

19:53.390 --> 19:56.590
My body can't cool itself.

19:56.590 --> 20:02.880
Doctors say my body heat
could burn me up.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.070
It's like...

20:05.090 --> 20:10.980
the Fires of Hell.

20:18.950 --> 20:24.200
A nation where only
the strongest survive

20:24.200 --> 20:28.200
is Hell on Earth.

20:28.230 --> 20:31.100
<i>Go to hell, government dogs!</i>

20:31.920 --> 20:34.370
You know,

20:34.370 --> 20:38.780
you clearly used us.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.220
"Us?"

20:40.220 --> 20:42.430
Me and...

20:42.430 --> 20:46.680
Hitokiri Battosai.

20:46.680 --> 20:51.110
If you value your life,

20:51.110 --> 20:53.480
execute him publicly.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.420
What?

20:54.420 --> 20:57.390
You hid your evil deeds!

20:57.390 --> 21:01.620
You lied Japan is
a beautiful country.

21:01.620 --> 21:06.900
Don't justify your actions!

21:09.880 --> 21:12.840
With him,

21:12.840 --> 21:19.960
confess your evil deeds
to the public.

21:28.770 --> 21:30.270
Listen!

21:30.270 --> 21:33.890
Manslayer Battosai
is a dangerous criminal.

21:33.890 --> 21:36.650
He's Himura Kenshin!

21:36.650 --> 21:39.910
If you see him,
alert the police!

21:39.910 --> 21:45.620
Average physique, red hair,
cross-shaped cheek scar.

21:45.620 --> 21:48.990
He's implicated in
an insurrection.

21:49.020 --> 21:52.900
He's desperate and dangerous.

21:52.910 --> 21:56.700
If you see him,
alert the police.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.240
You're back.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.300
What's this?

22:13.300 --> 22:16.770
It's Shishio's demand.
No choice.

22:16.770 --> 22:20.370
- Shishio's demand? - Yes.

22:20.370 --> 22:23.540
Battosai aided the government.

22:23.540 --> 22:27.640
He's to kill Shishio;
yet you obey Shishio?

22:27.640 --> 22:31.220
Shishio can blackmail us.

22:31.220 --> 22:37.499
We can't confront him.

22:38.600 --> 22:43.780
Himura isn't easy to catch.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.620
We'll research the ship,

22:46.620 --> 22:52.290
build a cannon, and
plan to topple Shishio!

22:52.300 --> 22:55.450
Battosai is a pawn?

22:55.450 --> 23:00.099
Watch your words.

23:04.400 --> 23:12.499
Politicians forgot
a warrior's honour.

23:16.820 --> 23:20.999
What is this?

23:24.770 --> 23:29.200
Oi, but "Wanted by the Government"

23:29.200 --> 23:32.990
means he's not dead?

23:32.990 --> 23:37.600
Himura is alive?

23:37.600 --> 23:42.880
Right, he'd be alive!
With Kaoru!

23:42.880 --> 23:48.800
But why's he "Wanted"?

23:48.800 --> 23:53.340
- Can't stay. Oi, Yahiko, let's go!
- Go where?

23:53.340 --> 23:55.660
Tokyo! Kamiya dojo.

23:54.340 --> 23:56.880
{\an1}<i>Excuse me!</i>

23:55.660 --> 23:59.000
He'd go there! Pack!

23:58.000 --> 23:59.700
{\an1}<i>Excuse me!</i>

23:59.000 --> 24:02.780
- Yes. - What is it?

24:02.780 --> 24:08.000
This belongs to this inn, right?

24:08.000 --> 24:12.900
( Aoiya Inn )

24:16.140 --> 24:20.920
<i>Hold still.</i>

24:21.740 --> 24:25.099
This is...

24:34.520 --> 24:36.510
Oi!

24:39.410 --> 24:40.810
Kaoru.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.420
- Kaoru! - <i>Ssh!</i>

24:42.420 --> 24:44.400
Patients are here!

24:44.400 --> 24:46.800
Sorry.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.370
Kaoru!

24:48.370 --> 24:51.000
- Kaoru.
- Are you family?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.510
Kind of.

24:53.510 --> 24:58.080
Fishermen found her,
and brought her in.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.990
Kaoru.

25:01.650 --> 25:06.600
Kaoru, what happened?

25:06.600 --> 25:09.680
Things went wrong.

25:09.680 --> 25:15.990
If we don't go,
who'll protect him?

25:38.400 --> 25:42.990
I told you many times...

25:44.420 --> 25:49.970
Kenjutsu is a killing sword art.

25:49.970 --> 25:54.680
However you gloss over it,

25:54.680 --> 25:59.170
it's the truth.

25:59.170 --> 26:04.020
Your shallow, naive idealism,

26:04.020 --> 26:08.280
considering the danger you face,

26:08.280 --> 26:14.510
and your wish to protect both sides,

26:14.510 --> 26:20.099
is arrogant stubbornness.

26:30.810 --> 26:34.900
Kaoru-dono.

26:36.170 --> 26:42.999
You're still a kid
digging graves?

27:06.150 --> 27:14.900
At your level,
can you learn the Ogi?

27:17.000 --> 27:25.990
Train more...only then
I'll reveal it.

27:39.680 --> 27:46.990
As a kid, you kept coming at me...

28:12.950 --> 28:20.900
even if you got hit or beaten down.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.080
Misao.

29:09.370 --> 29:11.170
Grandpa.

29:11.170 --> 29:13.170
I'm glad!

29:13.170 --> 29:19.999
Aoshi... where is he?

29:21.610 --> 29:26.940
Is Kyoto alright?

29:26.940 --> 29:33.999
It's fine. But...Himura...

29:39.200 --> 29:42.540
I see.

29:42.540 --> 29:46.400
If Himura is alive...

29:46.400 --> 29:53.099
there's one place he'd go.

30:35.850 --> 30:42.900
Have a cup of sake.

30:43.400 --> 30:47.990
I made this.

30:51.910 --> 30:54.980
Thanks.

30:58.820 --> 31:04.999
- Why'd you turn to pottery?
- Mm?

31:05.010 --> 31:09.750
Who knows?

31:09.910 --> 31:13.680
If I had to answer...

31:13.680 --> 31:24.900
'I made the bowl
to drink sake.'

31:25.620 --> 31:29.910
That's it.

31:29.910 --> 31:33.099
I see.

31:36.070 --> 31:43.900
I recall you often said...

31:45.450 --> 31:50.870
<i>'Spring cherry blossoms,
Summer stars'</i>

31:50.870 --> 31:55.990
<i>'Autumn full moon,
Winter snow'</i>

31:56.020 --> 32:01.600
<i>'make sake taste good'</i>

32:01.600 --> 32:06.140
<i>'If it doesn't taste good'</i>

32:06.140 --> 32:13.990
<i>'something is wrong'</i>

32:19.340 --> 32:25.099
Let me say something.

32:27.210 --> 32:32.700
Your cheek scar...

32:36.350 --> 32:43.800
In the Bakamatsu,
Hitoriki Battosai shocked Kyoto

32:43.800 --> 32:49.050
with his cruelty.

32:49.050 --> 32:56.550
I'd never expect it
to be you.

33:11.620 --> 33:17.600
I started liking sake...

33:17.600 --> 33:22.970
when I got this scar.

33:23.440 --> 33:31.800
But drink tasted like blood.

33:39.310 --> 33:44.990
I'll kill no longer.

33:49.300 --> 33:54.140
This oath of yours...

33:54.140 --> 33:58.980
involves that weird katana.

34:19.480 --> 34:28.300
To defeat your foe
without killing?

34:28.300 --> 34:37.010
In this state, I can't
beat Shishio or his men.

34:41.040 --> 34:45.670
<i>The strong survive,
the weak die.</i>

34:45.670 --> 34:50.159
<i>That's plain truth.</i>

34:54.199 --> 34:58.290
Even if it costs my life,

34:58.290 --> 35:03.880
I must learn the Ogi here.

35:10.800 --> 35:15.099
Fool...

35:25.500 --> 35:29.900
Do you plan to die...

35:29.900 --> 35:34.000
right now?

35:40.320 --> 35:46.900
I'll give you time...

35:47.280 --> 35:54.900
to figure out what's
lacking in you.

35:56.900 --> 36:04.950
Use your stupid brain
and show me.

36:10.940 --> 36:17.340
If you don't realize
what it is...

36:25.200 --> 36:31.470
your life will end here.

36:59.050 --> 37:06.970
<i>What...am I lacking?</i>

38:40.820 --> 38:46.900
You had a sleepless night.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.490
Well?

38:50.490 --> 38:55.740
Did you realize
what you lack?

38:55.740 --> 38:59.099
No.

39:02.980 --> 39:08.550
Is this your limit?

39:13.620 --> 39:18.320
If you can't see your lack,

39:18.320 --> 39:23.900
you can't win.

39:28.150 --> 39:33.480
If you win by luck,

39:33.480 --> 39:39.200
you won't defeat
your hitokiri self.

39:39.200 --> 39:44.900
It mustn't win.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.560
You'll always feel

39:48.560 --> 39:50.630
suffering

39:50.630 --> 39:54.040
and grief

39:54.040 --> 39:58.900
and you'll kill again.

40:00.340 --> 40:04.880
For this reason...

40:05.140 --> 40:11.900
my last duty as your master...

40:13.360 --> 40:23.540
is sending this hitokiri
to Hell.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.610
<i>I'm shaking.</i>

40:48.610 --> 40:53.660
<i>Am I afraid of my master,
Hiko Seijuro?</i>

41:04.800 --> 41:06.740
<i>No...</i>

41:06.740 --> 41:12.999
<i>I fear sure death
by his sword.</i>

41:23.800 --> 41:28.950
<i>Do not be afraid...</i>

41:29.280 --> 41:38.200
<i>I was ready for death
long before the Bakumatsu ended.</i>

41:38.200 --> 41:43.100
Even if it costs my life...

41:43.100 --> 41:47.099
I must learn the Ogi now!

41:56.570 --> 41:57.950
<i>I can't die yet!</i>

41:57.950 --> 42:02.400
<i>I need to live!</i>

42:13.620 --> 42:18.990
You finally understand?

42:19.650 --> 42:25.990
As a manslayer,
you took countless lives.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.700
The resulting guilt
is too heavy

42:30.700 --> 42:36.990
and you don't value
your own life.

42:38.020 --> 42:41.660
What you just learned,

42:41.660 --> 42:43.780
when you were

42:43.780 --> 42:48.700
on death's brink...

42:48.700 --> 42:54.090
is the will to live.

42:54.100 --> 42:59.990
The will to live...

43:00.420 --> 43:09.300
If you sacrifice yourself
to save others,

43:09.300 --> 43:13.880
their hearts will be sad.

43:13.880 --> 43:19.540
They won't feel happy.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.180
Your own life

43:24.180 --> 43:28.680
is as precious.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.740
Only when you value your life

43:33.740 --> 43:40.000
can you be open to the Ogi.

43:41.220 --> 43:46.990
My life...

43:50.570 --> 43:53.790
Your life

43:53.820 --> 43:59.770
isn't lived for you alone.

44:06.700 --> 44:11.120
If you understand...

44:11.120 --> 44:15.400
come at me once more.

45:31.800 --> 45:36.900
I want a beef pot now.

45:37.500 --> 45:38.670
Oi!

45:38.670 --> 45:41.080
What's that face?
Here, drink.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.999
Shut up! Let me be.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.660
Oi!

45:48.310 --> 45:53.900
What? Hurry and go!

46:23.050 --> 46:26.660
Oi! Oi, oi!

46:30.540 --> 46:33.140
Kaoru!

46:34.020 --> 46:37.900
Yahiko! Yahiko...

47:12.940 --> 47:16.640
<i>You must...stay alive!</i>

47:16.640 --> 47:18.220
<i>Kaoru-dono!</i>

47:45.140 --> 47:49.900
<i>Kaoru! Kaoru!</i>

47:51.570 --> 47:55.400
Kaoru! Oi, I found her!

47:55.470 --> 48:00.000
- Oi! Oi! Oi...!  - Kaoru!

48:00.150 --> 48:02.780
Kaoru, I was worried!

48:02.780 --> 48:05.780
Right, idiot! Kaoru!

48:05.780 --> 48:08.190
Don't worry us...

48:08.210 --> 48:11.199
Don't strain. Are you okay?

48:13.110 --> 48:14.900
Kenshin's coming.

48:14.900 --> 48:20.200
Oh, really? Kenshin...
What, Kenshin? Where...?

48:20.200 --> 48:22.820
Kenshin... Kenshin!

48:22.820 --> 48:25.280
Stupid! She didn't mean that.

48:25.280 --> 48:30.340
- Eh?! - She dreams of it!

48:30.340 --> 48:33.550
Let's go!

48:35.420 --> 48:37.900
Where'll we go?

48:37.900 --> 48:40.820
Where do you think?

48:40.820 --> 48:43.900
Tokyo.

48:43.900 --> 48:45.990
Eh?

48:48.600 --> 48:50.410
Kaoru!

48:50.500 --> 49:04.300
<i>Pull! Pull!</i>

49:06.770 --> 49:08.970
Hurry up!

49:48.940 --> 49:51.850
Going already?

49:51.850 --> 49:53.910
I'm out of time.

49:53.910 --> 49:56.900
By now, Shishio must be...

49:56.900 --> 50:03.410
Despite learning the Ogi,
don't be cocky.

50:03.410 --> 50:09.870
You want to protect
everything yourself.

50:09.870 --> 50:14.940
Meiji Era isn't so easy.

50:14.940 --> 50:17.850
Yes.

50:17.850 --> 50:20.240
<i>Himura!</i>

50:21.600 --> 50:23.000
Himura!

50:23.000 --> 50:24.370
Misao-dono.

50:24.370 --> 50:26.060
I was worried.

50:26.060 --> 50:29.950
How'd you find here?

50:30.020 --> 50:32.070
That doesn't matter.

50:32.070 --> 50:34.990
Kaoru is alive!

50:38.310 --> 50:41.260
Something bad happened.

50:41.260 --> 50:44.770
Shishio's ship threatens
the government.

50:44.770 --> 50:53.099
They want to arrest you.
Grandpa says it's Shishio's doing.

50:54.540 --> 50:58.900
Hurry and go.

51:01.820 --> 51:05.880
Your will to live

51:05.880 --> 51:10.999
must strengthen.

51:12.310 --> 51:17.990
Promise me, Kenshin.

51:19.800 --> 51:28.600
Do not throw away your life.

51:28.600 --> 51:31.950
Yes.

51:33.770 --> 51:37.110
Master.

51:38.540 --> 51:44.900
Thanks for your care.

52:04.400 --> 52:08.660
Don't die.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.900
[ Aoiya Inn ]

52:20.010 --> 52:25.740
The Government's after you.

52:25.740 --> 52:31.900
If found, you'll be executed.

52:31.900 --> 52:34.000
Himura-dono.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.170
This was Oniwabanshu's
secret way to Edo.

52:38.170 --> 52:41.620
Please keep this.

52:41.620 --> 52:45.200
Thank you.

52:45.200 --> 52:49.970
Misao-dono. I'll speak
with Okina-dono.

52:49.970 --> 52:52.900
Alright.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.990
Grandpa.

52:59.020 --> 53:02.990
Himura returned!

53:08.900 --> 53:13.900
His injuries aren't healed...

53:28.940 --> 53:33.999
You kept something from me?

53:47.340 --> 53:57.370
When the Oniwaban
used to go east,

53:57.370 --> 54:03.900
we'd go this way.

54:04.070 --> 54:09.940
'Himura-kun will take this path,'

54:09.970 --> 54:15.900
is what you're thinking.

54:18.400 --> 54:23.490
But...Himura-kun...

54:23.510 --> 54:32.500
has a mission...
to defeat Shishio.

54:32.500 --> 54:40.140
You can't obstruct him.

54:40.140 --> 54:42.999
What can you do?

54:43.000 --> 54:49.800
You are...stuck in the past.

54:49.800 --> 54:57.900
I will...correct this mistake.

55:09.350 --> 55:11.300
<i>Grandpa!</i>

55:11.450 --> 55:14.099
Grandpa!

55:15.270 --> 55:17.999
Okina!

55:21.190 --> 55:22.950
<i>Grandpa.</i>

55:24.740 --> 55:27.750
That scar...

55:27.750 --> 55:31.800
You're Himura Battosai.

55:32.060 --> 55:33.660
Okina!

55:37.170 --> 55:40.940
My 10-year wait is over.

55:40.940 --> 55:44.880
Edo Oniwabanshu,
Shinomori Aoshi.

55:44.880 --> 55:50.770
For 'Strongest' title,
I'll take your head!

56:03.800 --> 56:06.990
Go to Hell, Battosai!

56:11.880 --> 56:17.880
Right, now we can go all out.

56:18.010 --> 56:20.900
Himura!

56:21.220 --> 56:26.600
Kill Aoshi...

56:26.600 --> 56:31.300
for Misao's sake...and...

56:31.300 --> 56:36.700
for Aoshi himself.

56:36.700 --> 56:37.650
Grandpa.

56:37.650 --> 56:41.500
Sure, kill me.

56:41.500 --> 56:45.650
I'll see you try!

56:46.650 --> 56:50.780
Be sure to kill him...

56:50.780 --> 56:54.990
Make sure he dies!

57:01.670 --> 57:04.880
Shinomori Aoshi,

57:05.100 --> 57:11.850
aren't you the leader
Misao respected?

57:11.850 --> 57:15.170
You want to bleed?

57:15.170 --> 57:19.200
To take away
your 'Strongest' title,

57:19.200 --> 57:24.000
shedding blood doesn't matter.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.250
You...

59:01.250 --> 59:04.990
you're no longer our leader!

59:05.300 --> 59:07.160
Don't interfere!

59:07.160 --> 59:10.099
Misao-dono!

59:16.370 --> 59:19.600
Stand, Hitokiri Battosai.

59:19.600 --> 59:23.950
To get 'Strongest' title
of the Bakamatsu,

59:23.950 --> 59:29.980
I sacrificed everything
to defeat you.

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.800
Aoshi...

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.700
whatever your past inflicted,

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:04.400
how heaven your burden,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.100
I may never know.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.590
But...

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:14.720
if you ignore what is
in plain sight,

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.780
if you ignore what matters,

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:24.900
you won't defeat this one.

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:56.920
Aoshi-sama!

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:09.900
I want to end this
so I can move on.

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:23.050
When you find
what's precious to you,

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:29.090
if you still want
'Strongest' title,

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:35.990
this one will fight you,
that I will.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.950
Miss! Okina!

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Grandpa...

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.720
Grandpa! Grandpa!

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.950
Okina-dono...

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:10.200
Go, time's short!
Don't stop for us.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.570
If he dies, let it
not be in vain!

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:22.250
Japan's future depends
on your sword!

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:28.099
Himura, go!

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.180
Hurry!

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:39.420
Go!

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.990
If you want to avenge Okina,
don't hesitate!

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:25.900
I don't need your sympathy.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:40.200
Oblige me

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:46.990
by staying alive...

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:55.990
for Grandpa...

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:02.990
and the Oniwaban.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.970
Megumi-dono.

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.779
Kenshin-san.

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:47.910
I was worried.

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:49.800
I'm fine.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.250
- Any news of Kaoru and Sanosuke?
- Yes.

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:55.399
Good.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.850
Sit. I'll get tea.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:02.399
I'm in a rush.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:08.990
I must stop Shishio myself.

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:14.800
Alright.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.700
But, you know...

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.740
you must return alive.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:29.680
I can do nothing
if you're dead

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:36.330
but if you survive,
I'll heal you.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:43.899
Before saving others,
save yourself.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:51.319
- My master's same words.
- Eh?

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:55.900
Wait a moment.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.900
Wear these.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:07.999
<i>The sword isn't for killing.</i>

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:16.150
<i>Kamiya Kasshin style
is to protect people.</i>

01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:19.910
<i>A sword shouldn't kill.</i>

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:24.500
<i>A sword protects...</i>

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:36.950
Indeed, those clothes suit you.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:44.350
Take care of Kaoru and Yahiko.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.950
Arrest him!

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.150
Himura Battosai, surrender!

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:02.350
Police surround this Dojo!

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:03.680
You can't escape.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.880
- Surrender now! - Surrender now!

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.380
All of you!

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.850
How dare you?!

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:14.990
Megumi-dono.

01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:21.170
You wanted him to kill Shishio...
now you obey Shishio?

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:25.910
If you want Kenshin,
kill me first!

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:27.390
Arrest him!

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:29.990
Megumi-dono, stay back.

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:32.910
Get him!

01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:42.900
I'm grateful.

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:57.990
Kenshin! Kenshin!

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:19.990
Enough.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:31.940
I've no reason to fight you.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.960
Seize him!

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.900
Get him!

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.900
<i>Ken-san!</i>

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.900
It's done!

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.900
<i>Kenshin-san!</i>

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.480
Tie him up!

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.900
<i>Kenshin-san!</i>

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.400
<i>Kenshin-san!</i>

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.720
News! News!

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.390
Hitokiri Battosai was caught!

01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:07.990
Hitokiri Battosai was caught!

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:12.980
Legendary Manslayer Battosai
has been caught!

01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:30.040
It's about to begin.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.640
Your body's warmer than usual.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.720
Yes.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.940
You must heed advice.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:41.640
What is it?

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.810
Normal body sweat
regulates temperature.

01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:50.500
But, after your burns...

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.990
How long?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.580
How much time for me?

01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:01.670
The doctor said
15 minutes limit.

01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:07.990
So personally avoid battle.

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:11.600
15 minutes?

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.990
That's enough.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.600
Kneel!

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.950
At attention!

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:12.900
Follow me.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.990
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.600
Ito-san.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:40.700
I hoped you'd buy us more time.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.940
I'm sorry, Himura.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:50.990
I must sacrifice you.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.280
You always meant to.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.580
Shishio's aim isn't blackmail.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:04.090
He'll take over the nation.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:11.270
He's counting on your murders
in the Meiji era

01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:15.850
to lead to your punishment.

01:17:15.850 --> 01:17:19.500
That's his aim.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:25.050
He has a giant ship
on the Tokyo coast.

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:28.100
If we fight him now,

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:35.990
Tokyo will incur heavy damage.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.900
Ito-san.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:52.000
Will you kill me this way?

01:17:55.970 --> 01:18:03.000
If I can get to Shishio,
I can beat him.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.860
Is that so.

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.720
Interesting.

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.990
Go ahead.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:35.090
I'll give you a legendary ending.

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.110
<i>'Hitokiri Battosai arrested'</i>

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:31.940
<i>'public beheading'</i>

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:36.770
Are you kidding me?!

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:39.680
What's this public execution?!

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.770
What are they doing?!

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.790
I must go to him. Come, hurry!

01:19:44.800 --> 01:20:00.400
Pull right!

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.990
Make way!

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.630
<i>Murderer! Monster!</i>

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.100
<i>Murderer!</i>

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.520
<i>Pay with your life!</i>

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:35.710
Kenshin!

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:41.990
Kenshin!

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.140
Kenshin!

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.140
Kenshin!

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:19.000
<i>You monster! Die!</i>

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.100
Where is Shishio?

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:49.990
I'll witness your end
on his behalf.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.150
Stupid man...

01:21:58.150 --> 01:22:03.850
to be killed by the Government
you helped form.

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:07.700
Your efforts went unrewarded.

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.400
Tell Shishio

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.440
I'll wait for him in Hell.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.900
Think you can fight there.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.730
<i>Wait!</i>

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.900
- Oi, Kenshin!
- Oi, Kenshin!

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.540
Move!

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:43.000
Oi! Kenshin!

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.990
Wait. Kenshin! Wait!

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:08.900
This man, during the 3 years
of the Bunkyu era...

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:20.300
and the chaotic Shogunate ending,
in the final days of Edo,

01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:27.970
took more lives than could
be counted...

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.820
What is it?

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.500
<i>Hurry up!</i>

01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:44.950
What is it?

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:52.280
Himura Battosai!

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.220
His cruel actions

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:02.390
will be punished in this new era!

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:03.840
Shut up!

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.270
Those killed by Battosai...

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:09.980
No...

01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:19.000
I will read the names of
those innocent ones!

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:31.180
These are their names:

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.290
Kujo Kesudai.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.970
Tsutsui Naoi.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:38.300
First son of Madero Koji family,

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.330
Oguri Atsumori.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.530
Kujo Kao, samurai.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.999
Squad leader,
Shimamura Tatsumasa.

01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:47.240
Izan Koyowadan.

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:49.590
Matsumura Korosuke.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.900
Kajuno Katsumasa.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.900
Nagano Kitsusuke.

01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:58.120
Hikone squad leader,

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.000
Imoto Tamaroshi.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.940
Akizuki Tokuba.

01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:04.290
Kanbei Tado.

01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:08.040
Squad leader, Toda Goemon.

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:14.040
And another squad leader,
Makino Hitoshi.

01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:18.530
First son of a family,
Takigawa Masahiko.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.900
Inoue Kagehiro.

01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:28.030
And a young Kyoto samurai
about to marry...

01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:31.900
Kiyosato Akira!

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.999
<i>You're getting married
in these times?</i>

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.990
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:45.450
Some victims were young,
with bright futures.

01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:50.310
He acted too cruelly!

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:57.500
Because of his criminal record,
we now execute him in public!

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.400
<i>I...I can't die!</i>

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.780
<i>I have a loved one.</i>

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.950
<i>I can't die here!</i>

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:23.099
<i>I can't die... can't die...</i>

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.690
If you can't work out
what you lack,

01:26:28.690 --> 01:26:34.200
your inner self that's hitokiri

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.320
will never be defeated.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.760
You'll always feel

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.910
suffering,

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:48.820
and grief...

01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:54.080
and you'll kill again.

01:26:54.170 --> 01:27:02.990
<i>I will no longer...kill.</i>

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:12.499
The Legend...ends!

01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:16.920
Kenshin!

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:22.450
<i>Never again...</i>

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:28.999
Your life is also precious.

01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:34.999
Before saving others,
save yourself.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.950
<i>Never...</i>

01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:42.920
Wait!

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.020
Stop!

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:06.990
The show's over.

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.310
Himura-san!

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.980
What can a child's toy do?

01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:20.700
It's not a child's toy.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:30.170
My oath to "not kill"
is my sakabato.

01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:32.760
Let's go.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.360
Yeah.

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:41.999
Retreat! To the ship!

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.370
Damn you! Damn you!

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:21.990
Kenshin!

01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:23.730
Sano.

01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:25.530
Stop worrying us!

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:26.660
Kaoru-dono and Yahiko?

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:30.990
Ah, they're fine.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.960
<i>We're gonna kill you!</i>

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:49.810
Prepare the boat!

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:53.980
Kenshin!

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.210
You'll get on that?

01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:58.940
Yes.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:31.510
Why waste your life, huh?

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:36.400
Someone... must...

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:42.770
for...the new era!

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:46.900
What new era?!

01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:59.910
Well done.

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.680
<i>Prepare to fire!</i>

01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:16.980
Fire!

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:27.540
Kenshin!

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:30.870
Kenshin!

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.990
Kenshin.

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.950
Kenshin!

01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.470
Kenshin.

01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:39.900
Kenshin.

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.100
Who're you...?

01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:49.990
Bandage Man, come out!

01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:18.999
Go ahead, Kenshin!

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:47.000
Damn.

01:33:48.210 --> 01:33:53.700
Oi, you okay? Hang on!

01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:59.990
What'd you do?

01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.540
I've fought Christians

01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:19.999
but you're my first monk.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:34.920
Ow, it really hurts.

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:38.940
You're Shishio's comrade?

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.430
Comrade?

01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:41.720
Idiot!

01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:45.920
All we have in common is
our Meiji Government enemy.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:53.500
A man who fears the West and
distrusts the Government... Sadojima Hoji.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:35:03.420
A sad woman exiled by Meiji Government
...Komagata Yumi.

01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:08.290
An abused concubine's son
who, emotionally numbed,

01:35:08.290 --> 01:35:13.200
smilingly killed his family
...Seta Sojiro.

01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:18.550
We gathered around Shishio
for our own dreams...

01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:21.000
I dislike the Government

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.650
but peace was hard to get.

01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:28.990
How can you destroy it?!

01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:49.060
It's been a while.

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:50.670
Glad you're unharmed.

01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:54.480
- No time to chat.
- Stubborn!

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.300
Where is Shishio?

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.900
You can't defeat him.

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:03.999
He's a beast.

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:43.240
You got faster.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:48.450
Since you trained to face me,

01:36:48.450 --> 01:36:53.680
I should honour your efforts.

01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:22.750
I'm not dead, damn monk!

01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:01.900
Huh?

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:21.510
Huh...huh? Strange...

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:27.940
Don't rely on strength to win.

01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:37.500
So frustrating!

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.020
The strong prey on the weak.

01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:43.990
The strong live, the weak die!

01:38:48.010 --> 01:38:51.199
The strong live...

01:38:54.730 --> 01:38:56.999
The strong...

01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:00.900
The weak die.

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.340
The strong live...

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:07.250
the weak die!

01:39:12.210 --> 01:39:15.350
That's all!

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:26.900
The fight is over.

01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:29.990
I...

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.840
I was wrong?

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.440
No.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:42.600
It's just Shishio's theory
that strength wins.

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:48.120
If one or two fights
determined strength,

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:52.990
the world would be simpler.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:59.240
The answer is up to you.

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:04.990
Find your own answers.

01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:01.700
Take this!

01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.900
See you later!

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.550
It was fun.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.990
Train more...!

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.190
What?!

01:41:28.190 --> 01:41:30.010
Keep firing!

01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:32.500
Fire!

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:50.170
Wait! It's not time!

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:53.970
Who told you to fire?!

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.880
Himura and the rest
are on the ship.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:02.499
Keep firing!

01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:05.300
Don't tell me

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.100
it's Ito-sama's order?!

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:33.500
Hoji.

01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.050
Butt out.

01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:37.099
Yes.

01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:46.470
We meet again...

01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:48.780
senpai (Senior).

01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:51.670
I made you wait.

01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:54.970
You're wounded?

01:42:54.970 --> 01:42:57.500
How can you fight me?

01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:03.420
See for yourself.

01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:09.660
How long will this fight last.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:21.850
To the Government,
you and I are the same.

01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:27.880
They aim to drown us both
in the sea.

01:43:39.710 --> 01:43:43.940
Let's end this.

01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:04.800
Shishio-sama is powerful!

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:09.499
That's all you've got, senpai?

01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:27.990
Magnificent!

01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:33.850
Hoi, hoi!

01:45:33.850 --> 01:45:38.900
You're not done already?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.300
Aaah...

01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:58.900
Saito-san? Been a while.

01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:01.770
You came to defeat me?

01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:05.620
I'm here for the end.
Don't brag.

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:12.199
So what you got for me?

01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:33.170
It's useless against Shishio-sama!

01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:35.680
This ends you.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.900
The end, huh?

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:48.000
Too bad, Saito-san!

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.990
Hoi!

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:58.770
That's him?! Shishio!

01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:01.280
Wait, Hoji, do something!

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.820
You can't...!

01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.000
Move!

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.900
Huh?!

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.090
Don't butt in! What are you?

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:27.000
That's useless!

01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:31.880
What are you?

01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:37.770
Get up!

01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:47.099
You're no match for me.

01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:03.570
That can't be all.

01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:07.870
Everyone's that weak?

01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:15.070
Don't strain, senpai.

01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:18.990
It's time to end it.

01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:30.210
Who are you? Another lost dog?

01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:32.970
Battosai is mine.

01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:34.700
<i>Aoshi...</i>

01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:39.990
No-one else can kill him!

01:48:58.690 --> 01:49:00.090
Kenshin!

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:05.990
What? I said to butt out!

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.990
Don't interfere!

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.980
Die!

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Butt out!

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.140
You're in the way!

01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:47.900
Get away!

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:55.099
Bastards! Go to hell!

01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:14.000
Bastards! Sinking us too?!

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.900
Bunch of garbage!

01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.900
Kenshin, out of the way!

01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:55.530
Son-of-a...

01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:12.900
If that's how it is...

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:34.990
Die!

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:48.490
My high body heat...

01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:51.900
got higher!

01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:56.990
I'm having so much fun!

01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:10.950
No, his time limit's up!

01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:14.510
<i>Shishio-sama!</i>

01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:18.900
Shishio-sama!

01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:22.900
Stop now!

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:26.020
He can no longer fight.

01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:29.110
Don't let him suffer.

01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:32.900
Please...

01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:41.400
You're careless.

01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.900
The fight hasn't ended.

01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:57.400
You...how can you...

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.820
betray your love?

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:03.570
Betray?

01:53:03.570 --> 01:53:08.090
Don't judge me by your standards.

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.990
So happy...

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.020
For the first time...

01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:28.620
I was of use...in battle.

01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:33.990
Wait for me in Hell.

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:51.610
Ke...Kenshin...

01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:55.100
Enough!

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:03.980
I'll end the likes of you.

01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:08.090
Then come!

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.850
Get up...

01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:07.420
Hoi...

01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:10.990
Get up!

01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:57.990
Shishio...

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.110
For you and me,

01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:06.220
the hitoriki age has ended.

01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:10.140
It hasn't ended

01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:15.990
as long as I wield
this Unlimited Blade.

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:31.990
It has ended...

01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:38.450
the moment I wield this sakabato!

01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:40.700
Go ahead.

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:44.920
This is the end!

01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:27.010
Hiten Mitsurugi Ogi...

01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:33.900
Heaven Soaring Dragon Flash.

01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:55.140
Don't forget, Himura.

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:59.990
This era chose you,
that's all.

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:05.990
I have not lost.

01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:26.040
It's a while since I had
such an enjoyable fight.

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:32.940
I last had this much fun
in the Bakamatsu.

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:38.950
I need to take over the nation!

01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:48.510
I have no more time to play.

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.100
See you in Hell,

01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:06.090
Battosai!

01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:57.980
Shishio Makoto...

02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:06.550
Goodbye.

02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:33.010
Let me go!

02:01:33.110 --> 02:01:35.660
Stop it!

02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:49.980
Let go!

02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:12.720
Kenshin!

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:21.600
Kenshin!

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.770
- I'll help. - Yahiko.

02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:28.990
You're alive.

02:02:30.250 --> 02:02:34.540
It's great you're okay.

02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:38.920
Aoshi-sama!

02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.799
It was tough on you.
Glad you're okay.

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:52.900
What'd you say?! We didn't fight for you!

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.900
{\an4}Sano!

02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:58.320
Shishio is dead.

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:02.990
Be satisfied.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.820
So...

02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:10.600
Shishio is dead.

02:04:10.610 --> 02:04:16.600
The nation is safe now, Kawaji.

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:18.999
Yes.

02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:31.990
Battosai is dead!

02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:40.810
Dead with the Bakumatsu!

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:50.450
Himura

02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:53.699
Kenshin...

02:04:53.770 --> 02:04:57.660
right?

02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:11.990
Salute the samurai!

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.900
Kenshin.

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:57.190
Let's go home.

02:08:04.650 --> 02:08:09.660
The season is changing.

02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:18.410
Your past as Battosai...

02:08:18.410 --> 02:08:23.990
is fading.

02:08:53.110 --> 02:08:58.490
That's a beautiful leaf.

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:09.099
I'll keep living like this.

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:21.000
Keep living...

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.010
in this new era.

02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:30.900
Kaoru-dono...

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:37.800
Watch over this era with me?

02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:39.999
Eh?

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:49.000
<i>So they say that time</i>

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
<i>takes away the pain</i>

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:57.000
<i>but I'm still the same</i>

02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:03.000
<i>And they say that I</i>

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:12.900
<i>will find another you-
that can't be true, oh</i>

02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:16.000
<i>Why didn't I realize?</i>

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
<i>Why did I tell lies?</i>

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:26.900
<i>Yeah, I wish that I could do it again</i>

02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:39.000
<i>Turning back the time</i>

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:39.900
<i>back when you were mine
(all mine)</i>

02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:43.000
<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:53.000
<i>hiroi atsumeta koukai wa namida e to kawari oh baby

<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000
<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000
<i>ano hi no kimi no egao wa omoide ni kawaru

02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:00.000
<i>Yeah, I wish that I could do it again</i>

02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:04.000
<i>Turning back the time</i>

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.900

(I want to forget you quickly)

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.000
<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:31.000
<i>hiroi atsumeta koukai wa namida e to kawari oh baby
(regrets I gathered turn into tears, oh baby)</i>

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
<i>So this is heartache?</i>

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.000
<i>ano hi no kimi no egao wa omoide ni kawaru
(your smile from that day becomes a memory)</i>

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000
<i>I miss you</i>

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.000
<i>I miss you</i>

02:13:50.000 --> 02:14:02.000
<i>I miss you</i>

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:09.000
<i>I miss you</i>
