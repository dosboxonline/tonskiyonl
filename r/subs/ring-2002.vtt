1:46:13.948 --> 1:46:15.279
Push.

1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:22.623
[ high-pitched
electronic whining ]

1:46:22.723 --> 1:46:26.627
It's going to keep killing,
isn't it?

1:46:26.727 --> 1:46:28.896
She'll never stop.

1:46:28.996 --> 1:46:30.364
Don't worry, sweetie.

1:46:30.464 --> 1:46:33.695
You're going to be okay.

1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:42.543
What about the person
we show it to?

1:46:42.643 --> 1:46:44.838
What happens to them?

1:46:51.419 --> 1:46:54.322
[ static hissing ]

1:46:54.422 --> 1:46:56.413
[ static blaring ]

1:54:24.171 --> 1:54:26.073
[ music box playing ]

1:54:26.173 --> 1:54:30.578
CHILD:
Here we go

1:54:30.678 --> 1:54:35.749
The world is spinning

1:54:35.849 --> 1:54:40.087
When it stops

1:54:40.187 --> 1:54:46.126
It's just beginning

1:54:48.095 --> 1:54:52.623
Sun comes up

1:54:52.733 --> 1:54:57.972
We laugh and we cry

1:54:58.072 --> 1:55:02.376
Sun goes down

1:55:02.476 --> 1:55:05.536
And then we all die.
