18:51.130 --> 18:52.298

18:52.298 --> 18:55.051
Oh, no, you absolutely do.

18:55.051 --> 18:59.555
I just was hoping you can
clear up a few things.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.349
Let's start easy.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.018
Do you sell these at
the Silverlake Farmers Market?

19:04.018 --> 19:05.644
I don't know.

No, I don't.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.315
Seth.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.192
I think you know
you're in trouble here.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.652
We tested the flowerpots.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.071
It's made of compressed heroin.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.072
I don't know what that is.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.199
You don't know
what heroin is?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.450
All right,
let's just cut to the chase.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.285
You're a low-level drug mule,

19:21.285 --> 19:23.079
most likely working
for the crew

19:23.079 --> 19:25.081
that converts the flowerpots
into street product.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.708
You figured nobody would miss
the real flowerpots

19:27.708 --> 19:29.251
that are packed
in the front of the truck

19:29.251 --> 19:31.128
to hide the fake ones,
so you started selling them.

19:31.128 --> 19:35.591
But you sold
the wrong planters.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.301
How am I doing?

You do know that El Jefe

I'm not a thief.

what you're talking about.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.729

Listen, you have more power

and you can name your terms,

19:55.611 --> 19:57.405
Otherwise, I'm afraid
the next time I see you,

19:57.405 --> 20:00.533

- You putting money on that?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.829
Hell no. I didn't say

20:20.928 --> 20:22.430
Yeah, I know.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.472
I didn't have anything
to hold him on.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.516
To be fair, you got him
to the finish line.

20:25.516 --> 20:26.684
Yeah, but I didn't
get him across.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.060

The florist tried
calling you, like, ten times.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.490
He thought we'd ghosted him.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.451
He had another order

Why wouldn't he call you?
