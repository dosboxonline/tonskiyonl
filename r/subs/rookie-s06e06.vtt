WEBVTT

00:01.104 --> 00:03.072
- You ever have roommates?
- Sure.

00:03.072 --> 00:05.626
I mean,
it's been a few decades.

00:05.626 --> 00:07.248
All right,
what was the proper etiquette

00:07.248 --> 00:10.079
when they would--
like, would have sleepovers?

00:10.079 --> 00:11.666
You mean,
when they're hooking up?

00:11.666 --> 00:13.082
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

00:13.082 --> 00:14.807
No nudity in shared spaces.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.982
You seeing a little more of
the boyfriend than you care to?

00:16.982 --> 00:18.397
So much more.

00:18.397 --> 00:19.640
You need to set
some boundaries.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.400
I have, regularly.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.817
And yet, I still got an eyeful
of Willy Wonka this morning.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.750
-

00:26.750 --> 00:28.752
Where the hell
are they going? Control,

00:28.752 --> 00:30.306
7-Adam-15.

00:30.306 --> 00:33.136
Advise status on any Code 3
events near our location?

00:33.136 --> 00:35.207
<i>Negative, 7-Adam-15.</i>

00:35.207 --> 00:36.243
What was their hurry?

00:36.243 --> 00:38.245
Let's find out.

00:46.494 --> 00:48.772
Smitty, go to Channel 9.

00:48.772 --> 00:49.808
Go for Smitty.

00:49.808 --> 00:51.120
Where's your shop?

00:51.120 --> 00:52.259
Where's my shop?

00:52.259 --> 00:54.088
It's parked right out--

00:54.088 --> 00:56.228
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

00:56.228 --> 00:57.850
Wait a minute.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.921
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you</i>

00:59.921 --> 01:03.063
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

01:15.937 --> 01:17.353
What's happening?

01:17.353 --> 01:19.113
I've been waiting
for you to wake up.

01:19.113 --> 01:22.392
I think we should have a baby.

01:22.392 --> 01:23.635
Oh.

01:23.635 --> 01:25.706
Is that something
you're open to?

01:25.706 --> 01:26.741
I'm-- I-- I--

01:26.741 --> 01:28.157
I don't know.

01:28.157 --> 01:30.711
I love being a dad,
but I think I thought

01:30.711 --> 01:34.887
maybe my days of dirty
diapers and sleepless nights

01:34.887 --> 01:36.130
were over.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.614
But you were about
to foster Anna.

01:37.614 --> 01:38.615
No, yes.

01:38.615 --> 01:39.996
That's true, I was.

01:39.996 --> 01:42.343
But she had no one.

01:42.343 --> 01:44.897
I think it kind of--
it felt like fate.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.140
Hmm.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.866
So is that a no?

01:47.866 --> 01:50.593
No, it's-- it's an,
"A I haven't even had

01:50.593 --> 01:51.697
"a cup of coffee yet.

01:51.697 --> 01:54.769
Maybe we table this
till later."

01:54.769 --> 01:56.046
Absolutely.

01:56.046 --> 01:57.841
This is a really
big conversation,

01:57.841 --> 01:59.291
so let's just think about it,

01:59.291 --> 02:00.810
and we can talk again
after work.

02:00.810 --> 02:01.880
Right.

02:01.880 --> 02:02.984
OK.

02:08.749 --> 02:10.371
Yeah?

02:10.371 --> 02:12.373
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how stressed are you?

02:12.373 --> 02:13.961
- 19.
- Yikes.

02:13.961 --> 02:14.962
Tim still ghosting you?

02:14.962 --> 02:16.446
He's not ghosting me.

02:16.446 --> 02:18.138
We just haven't talked
in a couple of days.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.243
Not speaking to the
person you're dating--

02:20.243 --> 02:22.452
Is the definition
of ghosting.

02:22.452 --> 02:23.488
I realize that.

02:23.488 --> 02:24.903
Thank you.

02:24.903 --> 02:27.285
So this probably
isn't a good time to add

02:27.285 --> 02:30.080
more stress to your plate.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.047
What's wrong?

02:31.047 --> 02:33.567
Nothing.

02:33.567 --> 02:36.121
It's just I have a group
of friends at school,

02:36.121 --> 02:37.502
and they're getting
a place together,

02:37.502 --> 02:39.745
and I was thinking
of joining them.

02:39.745 --> 02:40.919
You're moving?

02:40.919 --> 02:42.507
Kind of.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.682
That's great.
- Really?

02:45.682 --> 02:47.132
Yeah.

02:47.132 --> 02:49.169
I mean, you should live
with people your own age.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.240
I mean, I'll miss
seeing you every day,

02:51.240 --> 02:54.484
but if it makes you happy,
then that's great.

02:54.484 --> 02:55.554
Good.

02:55.554 --> 02:57.280
I was worried you'd be upset.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.799
The house they picked
is really cool.

02:58.799 --> 03:00.387
I'll show you
pictures after school.

03:00.387 --> 03:01.560
I can't wait.

03:11.052 --> 03:12.122
Hey.

03:12.122 --> 03:13.296
Have you talked
to Tim recently?

03:13.296 --> 03:14.608
No.

03:14.608 --> 03:16.092
I heard he was
taking vacation days.

03:16.092 --> 03:17.335
Do you think he's in trouble?
- Yes.

03:17.335 --> 03:18.405
I--

03:19.785 --> 03:21.787
He said that if he tells
me what he's doing,

03:21.787 --> 03:24.342
I could put my
career in jeopardy.

03:24.342 --> 03:25.446
That's alarming.

03:25.446 --> 03:26.516
I know.

03:26.516 --> 03:28.553
Should I-- should I tell Grey?

03:28.553 --> 03:29.899
No.

03:29.899 --> 03:31.521
Hard as it is,
you need to trust him.

03:31.521 --> 03:33.282
Whatever he's doing,
I'm sure Tim's got it handled.

03:33.282 --> 03:34.869
OK.

03:34.869 --> 03:37.424
So I'm just supposed to do
nothing, patrol like normal,

03:37.424 --> 03:39.426
pretend like I'm not
worried out of my mind?

03:39.426 --> 03:40.565
For now, yes.

03:43.153 --> 03:44.224
Thanks.

03:46.881 --> 03:48.745
<i>And if you're just
joining us</i>

03:48.745 --> 03:50.644
<i>it's been
a pitcher's clinic here,</i>

03:50.644 --> 03:54.268
<i>tied ball game in the bottom
of the seventh, 2-all.</i>

03:54.268 --> 03:55.442
Hi.

03:55.442 --> 03:57.237
Oh my god.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.066
What are you doing?

03:59.066 --> 04:00.654
Being a friend.

04:00.654 --> 04:02.552
What are you doing?

04:02.552 --> 04:03.553
Talk.

04:03.553 --> 04:04.623
I can't.

04:04.623 --> 04:05.935
For your own good.

04:05.935 --> 04:07.557
Are you engaged
in a criminal act?

04:07.557 --> 04:08.938
Not at the moment.

04:08.938 --> 04:10.595
Then tell me.

04:10.595 --> 04:14.323
Angela, this goes sideways
and you're anywhere near it,

04:14.323 --> 04:15.634
you could be fired.

04:15.634 --> 04:17.464
If Lucy gets fired,
it's a problem.

04:17.464 --> 04:20.052
If I get fired, I start living
off my husband's trust fund

04:20.052 --> 04:22.192
and call it wine o'clock.

04:22.192 --> 04:24.436
So spill.

04:24.436 --> 04:28.129
I'm tailing this guy from
my old unit, Ray Watkins.

04:28.129 --> 04:31.305
Spent his deployment
ripping off Iraqi locals,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.790
got a couple of my men killed.

04:33.790 --> 04:36.897
Till a few days ago,
I thought he was KIA.

04:36.897 --> 04:38.485
Somehow he survived
and now he's

04:38.485 --> 04:40.556
living under a different
name as a hired gun.

04:40.556 --> 04:41.695
So why tail him?

04:41.695 --> 04:42.937
At a minimum, he's AWOL.

04:42.937 --> 04:45.008
Why not just detain
him and turn him

04:45.008 --> 04:46.320
over to the military police?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.839
Because he's got
something on me.

04:47.839 --> 04:52.326
He knows I lied on the
report about his death.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.294
So you're trying to
catch him in a fresh crime,

04:54.294 --> 04:56.088
arrest him for what
he's doing now.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.849
Exactly.

04:57.849 --> 04:59.126
Cool.

04:59.126 --> 05:00.921
I'm in.

05:00.921 --> 05:03.095
Are you sure?

05:03.095 --> 05:04.096
Yeah.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.235
I got your back, boo.

05:07.686 --> 05:08.998
You're having a baby?

05:08.998 --> 05:09.999
That's so great.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.311
That's not what I said.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.141
I said Bailey wants
to have a baby.

05:14.141 --> 05:18.352
And you don't,
because you're ol... der

05:18.352 --> 05:21.735
and feel like your child
raising years are behind you?

05:21.735 --> 05:24.082
Look, I loved raising Henry.

05:24.082 --> 05:25.670
It was incredible.

05:25.670 --> 05:28.328
But there is a lot I want
to accomplish on the job,

05:28.328 --> 05:32.021
and I don't have a lot of
time left, because I am older.

05:32.021 --> 05:35.852
OK, I get that,
but have you seen babies?

05:35.852 --> 05:37.785
They're so cute,
and I feel like you

05:37.785 --> 05:39.097
should have like three.

05:39.097 --> 05:40.443
OK.

05:40.443 --> 05:42.756
I am deleting Bailey's
number from your phone.

05:42.756 --> 05:44.792
Oh, we're being
assigned to assist

05:44.792 --> 05:47.416
CitySafe LA in cleaning
up an encampment

05:47.416 --> 05:49.176
of unhoused residents.

05:49.176 --> 05:53.042
LA County Sheriff is bringing
a group of inmates to assist.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.252
Ma'am?

05:56.252 --> 05:57.391
Excuse me, ma'am?
I cannot let you--

05:57.391 --> 05:58.599
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

05:58.599 --> 05:59.980
No.

05:59.980 --> 06:01.257
He won't let me bring
drinks to my daughter

06:01.257 --> 06:02.396
and her friends.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.880
Come on.
They're dying in this heat.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.365
Ma'am, it is 70 degrees.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.814
Is your daughter homeless?

06:06.814 --> 06:08.678
No, she's one of the inmates.

06:08.678 --> 06:10.335
- Mom.
- Honey.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.233
Hey.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.235
Trustee, get back here.

06:14.235 --> 06:15.236
Oh.

06:15.236 --> 06:16.237
I missed you.

06:16.237 --> 06:17.238
Me too.

06:17.238 --> 06:18.619
You smell good.

06:18.619 --> 06:19.689
Ooh, you don't,
but I still love you.

06:19.689 --> 06:20.828
No contact.

06:20.828 --> 06:22.416
OK, hey, hey,
what's the harm?

06:22.416 --> 06:23.900
We're literally
surrounded by police.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.143
You're not the one
who has to search her

06:25.143 --> 06:26.662
for contraband after this.

06:26.662 --> 06:28.077
You, leave.

06:28.077 --> 06:30.182
You, back to work.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.425
See you in two weeks.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.530
Yeah.

06:34.497 --> 06:37.638
I hope you have a horrible day.

06:37.638 --> 06:39.433
Give me the bag.
Let it go.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.228
Let it go.
Let it go.

06:41.228 --> 06:42.229
- Hey.
- Give it--

06:42.229 --> 06:43.644
- Hey.
- Let it go.

06:43.644 --> 06:44.714
Hey, what's going on?

06:44.714 --> 06:45.784
She's trying to steal my bag.

06:45.784 --> 06:47.234
Sir, no she's not, OK?

06:47.234 --> 06:48.822
We're going to pack
up your belongings

06:48.822 --> 06:50.444
and send them to the shelter.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.239
That's the same thing
you said last time.

06:52.239 --> 06:53.896
When I got my tent back,
it was ripped in three places.

06:53.896 --> 06:55.380
OK, how about we let
him hold on to the bag

06:55.380 --> 06:57.417
for a little bit?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.488
Whoa, hang on. Hang on.

06:59.488 --> 07:00.523
Thank you.

07:00.523 --> 07:01.593
Give it to me--

07:01.593 --> 07:03.768
Sir, back up.

07:03.768 --> 07:04.803
Hey, Officer Nolan?

07:08.945 --> 07:11.154
Do you remember
the Karina Lewis case?

07:11.154 --> 07:12.777
Yeah.

07:12.777 --> 07:15.193
College gymnast, boyfriend
murdered her a few years back,

07:15.193 --> 07:16.574
but the body was never found.

07:16.574 --> 07:17.575
Yeah.

07:17.575 --> 07:18.610
This is her bag.

07:18.610 --> 07:20.888
It went missing along with her.

07:20.888 --> 07:22.925
Sir, where did
you get this bag?

07:22.925 --> 07:24.582
Hey, I found that.

07:24.582 --> 07:26.273
I swear.

07:26.273 --> 07:28.033
This place just
became a crime scene.

07:28.033 --> 07:29.069
Lock it down.

07:29.069 --> 07:30.553
Officer Nolan?

07:30.553 --> 07:32.210
Oh, what now?

07:32.210 --> 07:34.384
I just found these
in the garbage can.

07:34.384 --> 07:36.145
And one of the prisoners
just escaped.

07:44.325 --> 07:45.948
- So, where'd you get this?
- Well, I didn't steal it.

07:45.948 --> 07:47.432
Y'all assume just
because we're homeless--

07:47.432 --> 07:49.123
I don't assume
anything, but stealing it

07:49.123 --> 07:50.849
is better than taking
it off a murder victim

07:50.849 --> 07:53.058
making yourself a suspect.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.474
Yeah, well, it was neither
of those things, all right?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.960
I found the bag in
Griffith Park last week.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.375
I can show you where.
- OK.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.756
Good.
Let's go.

08:00.756 --> 08:01.895
You're riding with me.

08:01.895 --> 08:03.068
Yes, ma'am.

08:05.968 --> 08:07.452
Payoff.

08:07.452 --> 08:08.867
Maybe he's smuggling
something into the country.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.351
Or out.

08:10.351 --> 08:12.043
Or maybe Ray lost a
bet and is innocent.

08:12.043 --> 08:13.803
I mean, you've been following
this guy for two days

08:13.803 --> 08:15.598
and haven't seen anything
remotely criminal.

08:15.598 --> 08:17.289
How long are you
going to keep this up?

08:17.289 --> 08:18.774
- As long as it takes.
- Really?

08:18.774 --> 08:20.569
You just walk away
from your job,

08:20.569 --> 08:22.605
your relationship with Lucy
to arrest a guy you haven't

08:22.605 --> 08:24.158
thought about in a decade?

08:24.158 --> 08:25.228
Yeah.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.163
What?

08:29.163 --> 08:32.235
If you lied on a report, you
must have had a good reason.

08:32.235 --> 08:34.617
I was trying to protect
Ray's family so they'd

08:34.617 --> 08:36.136
get his death benefits.
- Noble.

08:36.136 --> 08:37.862
Lucy would understand that.

08:37.862 --> 08:39.311
Yeah, but she'd still get in
trouble if she didn't notify

08:39.311 --> 08:40.934
IA about my transgression.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.038
True.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.835
This is very irritating.

08:45.835 --> 08:47.872
I don't think you're
just protecting her.

08:47.872 --> 08:49.667
I think you're
protecting yourself.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.048
There's something else you did
that you don't want to admit.

08:52.048 --> 08:53.602
And you're basing this on?

08:53.602 --> 08:54.603
I'm your BFF.

08:54.603 --> 08:56.018
I know you.

08:56.018 --> 08:57.191
I'm a grown man.

08:57.191 --> 08:58.641
I don't have BFFs.

08:58.641 --> 08:59.918
Technically,
you can only have one BFF.

09:05.406 --> 09:07.581
I'm going to take
a closer look.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.651
Wait.

09:08.651 --> 09:11.067
Come on.

09:38.301 --> 09:39.717
Mystery man had
diplomatic plates.

09:39.717 --> 09:40.890
We follow him or stay with Ray?

09:40.890 --> 09:42.582
Ray.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.032
I can ask my friend at State
for help IDing the new player.

09:45.032 --> 09:46.378
<i>Missing inmate
is Teresa Vaughn,</i>

09:46.378 --> 09:47.759
the girl you allowed
to make contact

09:47.759 --> 09:49.554
with a potential accomplice.
- OK.

09:49.554 --> 09:50.866
You're blaming me because
you failed to do your job?

09:50.866 --> 09:51.936
What the hell did you say?

09:51.936 --> 09:53.178
OK.

09:53.178 --> 09:54.628
We can play
the blame game later.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.457
Right now,
we have a fugitive to find.

09:56.457 --> 09:58.287
I agree it's most likely the
mother that helped her escape.

09:58.287 --> 09:59.564
That's our first lead.

09:59.564 --> 10:01.393
We can put a BOLO
out for Theresa.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.119
Why was Theresa incarcerated?

10:03.119 --> 10:07.020
Assault, but she only had
ten days left on her sentence.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.573
That doesn't make any sense.

10:08.573 --> 10:10.748
Trying to escape would
add at least a year.

10:10.748 --> 10:11.887
Why risk it?

10:14.372 --> 10:16.581
I was just reviewing the
details in Karina's case.

10:16.581 --> 10:18.859
She disappeared 19 months ago.

10:18.859 --> 10:20.654
Boyfriend was the
immediate suspect.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.725
He ultimately confessed
to strangling her

10:22.725 --> 10:24.416
in his apartment
down in Culver City,

10:24.416 --> 10:26.833
then he claims he blacked
out afterwards and forgot

10:26.833 --> 10:28.489
where he left the body.

10:28.489 --> 10:31.147
Any of this looking
familiar to you?

10:31.147 --> 10:32.735
Yeah, a little.

10:32.735 --> 10:34.703
I was trying to find
a place to sleep.

10:34.703 --> 10:37.257
Everything was so wet
because of the storm,

10:37.257 --> 10:38.603
but it was around here though.

10:38.603 --> 10:40.398
You know, a big flat rock.

10:40.398 --> 10:41.399
There.

10:41.399 --> 10:42.400
There it is right there.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.781
Behind there.

10:43.781 --> 10:45.645
It was all muddy
when I went through it.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.061
I was hoping to find some cash
or some food on the inside,

10:48.061 --> 10:49.959
but there was only a
couple of schoolbooks.

10:49.959 --> 10:51.720
Yeah, the rain could
have dislodged the bag

10:51.720 --> 10:52.928
causing it to go downhill.

11:10.808 --> 11:13.258
Karina Lewis.

11:13.258 --> 11:16.123
Well, at least now her family
can give her a proper burial.

11:21.957 --> 11:24.235
You said the boyfriend
confessed to strangling her?

11:24.235 --> 11:25.719
Yeah.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.859
Then why is there a
bullet wound in her head?

11:27.859 --> 11:30.931
That's a small caliber,
...22, maybe .38.

11:30.931 --> 11:33.451
Why confess to the murder
but lie about the method?

11:33.451 --> 11:34.728
<i>It makes no sense.</i>

11:34.728 --> 11:37.213
Teresa Vaughn was serving
six months for assault

11:37.213 --> 11:40.354
on a woman she claimed was
hooking up with her boyfriend.

11:40.354 --> 11:42.322
I'm not sure that's the
person I'd be assaulting.

11:42.322 --> 11:44.082
Not that violence
is ever the answer.

11:44.082 --> 11:47.741
<i>7-Adam-15, 7-Adam-6
pulled over your BOLO alert.</i>

11:47.741 --> 11:49.536
<i>Brenda Vaughn, fugitive's
mother, Third and Oak.</i>

11:49.536 --> 11:50.537
Copy that.

11:50.537 --> 11:52.297
Show us responding.

12:00.650 --> 12:01.962
No sign of the fugitive.

12:01.962 --> 12:03.792
- I told you.
- Thank you.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.414
Would you mind
going to her house

12:05.414 --> 12:06.518
in case the daughter
decides to show up there?

12:06.518 --> 12:08.762
You got it.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.385
I get how this looks,
but I had nothing to do

12:11.385 --> 12:12.973
with my daughter's escape.

12:12.973 --> 12:14.457
Any idea where your
daughter might have gone?

12:14.457 --> 12:15.769
No.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.460
But any place is better
than jail, right?

12:17.460 --> 12:19.324
Not when you have two
weeks left on your sentence.

12:19.324 --> 12:21.223
Why would she throw
that away now?

12:21.223 --> 12:24.019
Did you say something to
her, tell her a secret when

12:24.019 --> 12:25.710
you were giving her a hug?
- No.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.505
OK, so then you just
expect me to believe it's

12:27.505 --> 12:30.059
a coincidence she escaped
right after you showed up?

12:30.059 --> 12:33.373
I can't control what you
believe, but it's the truth.

12:33.373 --> 12:34.823
Do you have kids?

12:34.823 --> 12:36.134
Yeah, I have one.

12:36.134 --> 12:37.549
Then you understand
that I would

12:37.549 --> 12:39.828
do anything
to help my daughter,

12:39.828 --> 12:41.830
including practicing
tough love, OK?

12:41.830 --> 12:43.728
If Teresa asked me
to help her escape,

12:43.728 --> 12:46.386
I would have told her it is
the dumbest idea I'd ever heard

12:46.386 --> 12:48.250
and just suck it up
and finish her time.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.562
Any idea who might
help your daughter

12:50.562 --> 12:52.150
despite the consequences?

12:52.150 --> 12:55.188
She has a lot of friends,
but I doubt any of them

12:55.188 --> 12:56.914
would stick
their necks out for her.

12:56.914 --> 12:58.674
- What about the boyfriend?
- Mike?

12:58.674 --> 13:00.193
No.

13:00.193 --> 13:02.885
He broke up with her right
after she attacked Doreen.

13:02.885 --> 13:04.162
Oh, that's where.

13:04.162 --> 13:05.577
That's where what?

13:05.577 --> 13:08.028
Teresa is still
pissed about the affair.

13:08.028 --> 13:13.206
She told me she was planning
on doing some permanent damage

13:13.206 --> 13:15.725
to Doreen when she got out.

13:15.725 --> 13:17.762
Control, I'm going to need
an address on a Doreen--

13:17.762 --> 13:19.212
- Davis.
- Davis.

13:19.212 --> 13:21.214
Home and work.

13:26.253 --> 13:27.254
Doreen?

13:27.254 --> 13:28.255
Yeah.

13:28.255 --> 13:30.568
What's going on?

13:30.568 --> 13:32.777
Teresa Vaughn escaped
from custody this morning.

13:32.777 --> 13:34.261
Escaped?

13:34.261 --> 13:36.022
Yeah, but we're going
to make sure you're safe.

13:36.022 --> 13:37.817
Yeah, you don't need to.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.542
Teresa came by like
half an hour ago,

13:39.542 --> 13:43.546
said that she got
released early.

13:43.546 --> 13:45.203
Apologized for everything.

13:45.203 --> 13:46.791
Said that she should have
listened to me when I said

13:46.791 --> 13:48.482
I didn't hook up with Mike.
- Wait.

13:48.482 --> 13:49.656
So there was no affair?

13:49.656 --> 13:51.485
No.
Mike and I were friends.

13:51.485 --> 13:53.073
That's it.

13:53.073 --> 13:55.489
But he was definitely
cheating on her with someone.

13:55.489 --> 13:57.560
Well, did she say
where she was going next?

13:57.560 --> 13:58.768
No.

13:58.768 --> 14:01.392
Just she finally
knew who to blame.

14:04.188 --> 14:05.706
You're too close.

14:05.706 --> 14:07.467
I can't tail him by nose
with only one vehicle.

14:07.467 --> 14:08.951
Need to keep him in sight.
- We're going to get made.

14:08.951 --> 14:10.401
You should let me drive.
- I got it.

14:26.313 --> 14:29.178
I come in peace.

14:29.178 --> 14:30.593
Who's your friend?

14:30.593 --> 14:31.594
Ooh.

14:31.594 --> 14:33.251
Hey, mama.

14:33.251 --> 14:34.666
I thought you said this guy
was smart because all I see

14:34.666 --> 14:35.702
is slick.

14:35.702 --> 14:37.428
What's the plan here, Sarge?

14:37.428 --> 14:39.085
You just going to follow me
around all week while I

14:39.085 --> 14:40.707
wait for my mom to kick it?

14:40.707 --> 14:44.193
Yeah, we both know you're
not here for your mom.

14:44.193 --> 14:45.470
Mark bailed on you, huh?

14:45.470 --> 14:46.989
Did he lose his nerve?

14:46.989 --> 14:48.888
Maybe you did.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.650
Was there a falling out
over what to do with me?

14:52.650 --> 14:55.825
Let me guess,
he was team extermination

14:55.825 --> 14:58.967
and you were team justice.

14:58.967 --> 15:04.696
You know, this guy's nickname
in the service was the Reaper.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.527
It's sad when one of your
heroes grows a conscience.

15:10.288 --> 15:11.634
I'm going to go now.

15:11.634 --> 15:14.568
I'm open to some company
if you want a lift.

15:14.568 --> 15:17.986
I'll pass, but we'll be
seeing you again real soon.

15:17.986 --> 15:20.160
Can't wait.

15:28.410 --> 15:29.376
Thank you
for meeting with us.

15:29.376 --> 15:30.653
Yeah, no problem.

15:30.653 --> 15:32.207
Actually, you could help
me out with something.

15:32.207 --> 15:35.175
I have to approve a headshot
for my campaign website.

15:35.175 --> 15:38.454
Which one of these looks
more district attorney-ish?

15:39.559 --> 15:41.078
The one on the right.

15:41.078 --> 15:44.012
I agree.

15:44.012 --> 15:48.430
We need to talk about a case
that you prosecuted last year.

15:48.430 --> 15:49.534
Karina Lewis.

15:49.534 --> 15:50.984
Karina Lewis?

15:50.984 --> 15:53.262
Oh, yeah,
the boyfriend strangled her,

15:53.262 --> 15:54.436
full confession.

15:54.436 --> 15:55.747
He pled out,
doing 20 at Soledad.

15:55.747 --> 15:56.921
Right.

15:56.921 --> 15:59.855
Well, we found
her remains today.

15:59.855 --> 16:01.167
Well, hey, that's great news.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.996
The family can finally
put her to rest.

16:02.996 --> 16:06.310
Yes, but the only problem is,
she was not strangled.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.588
She was shot in the
head with a .22.

16:10.486 --> 16:11.832
Boyfriend lied
in his statement.

16:11.832 --> 16:13.627
Right,
which clearly was coerced.

16:13.627 --> 16:16.976
Uh, Officer Thorsen
is getting ahead of himself,

16:16.976 --> 16:20.565
but it is a significant
inconsistency.

16:20.565 --> 16:23.154
Is there any chance
it was a false confession?

16:23.154 --> 16:24.155
No.

16:24.155 --> 16:25.260
Are you serious?

16:25.260 --> 16:26.744
That fast, just no?

16:26.744 --> 16:29.919
Officer Thorsen,
wait for me outside, please?

16:29.919 --> 16:31.542
- Ma'am--
- Go.

16:31.542 --> 16:32.646
Now.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.723
I apologize.

16:40.723 --> 16:42.829
He clearly has brought some
of his own history into this.

16:42.829 --> 16:44.382
Mm-hmm.

16:44.382 --> 16:47.834
Look, you weren't there,
Detective, and neither was he.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.078
The investigation was solid.

16:50.078 --> 16:51.941
The boyfriend had a
history of violence.

16:51.941 --> 16:54.496
Hair matching the victim was
found in the trunk of his car.

16:54.496 --> 16:56.187
Witnesses heard them arguing.

16:56.187 --> 16:57.602
I could have gotten
a conviction

16:57.602 --> 16:59.087
even without his confession.

16:59.087 --> 17:00.674
So kindly invite
Officer Thorsen

17:00.674 --> 17:02.814
to take his
self-righteousness and stick it

17:02.814 --> 17:05.231
where the sun don't shine.

17:05.231 --> 17:06.542
Are we done here?

17:06.542 --> 17:07.647
Yes, sir.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.378
Is he really not
going to do anything?

17:14.378 --> 17:16.345
You cannot talk
to a prosecutor like that.

17:16.345 --> 17:17.346
Detective--

17:17.346 --> 17:18.347
Ever.

17:18.347 --> 17:20.073
Do you understand?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.489
Yes.

17:22.489 --> 17:24.457
Does this mean we're
abandoning the investigation?

17:24.457 --> 17:26.735
There is no we in
this, Officer Thorsen.

17:26.735 --> 17:28.357
This is not our investigation.

17:28.357 --> 17:31.567
It is mine, which means
that the risk of pissing off

17:31.567 --> 17:34.467
someone who will likely be
the next district attorney

17:34.467 --> 17:36.296
falls on me.

17:36.296 --> 17:37.849
OK.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.713
Does this mean you're
abandoning the investigation?

17:39.713 --> 17:41.094
No.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.062
It means that we need to
find undeniable evidence

17:43.062 --> 17:44.994
that Karina Lewis
was killed by someone

17:44.994 --> 17:46.479
other than the guy
who is currently

17:46.479 --> 17:48.274
sitting in prison
before we can even

17:48.274 --> 17:49.792
think about coming back here.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.521
Why are you smiling?

17:54.521 --> 17:55.867
Because you said we.

18:03.806 --> 18:05.153
Were there any
other suspects

18:05.153 --> 18:06.740
aside from the boyfriend?

18:06.740 --> 18:08.259
Yeah.

18:08.259 --> 18:09.743
A guy used to work with Karina
at her off-campus job,

18:09.743 --> 18:11.400
Ryan Jones.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.920
And fun fact, the detective
that interviewed him said Ryan

18:13.920 --> 18:15.301
was quite the gun collector.

18:15.301 --> 18:17.096
So it is likely
he would own a .22.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.718
Exactly.

18:18.718 --> 18:21.134
In my professional opinion,
his alibi was super shaky.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.240
Need I remind you,
five minutes,

18:23.240 --> 18:28.348
that your professional opinion
is still a work in progress?

18:28.348 --> 18:29.556
Noted.

18:29.556 --> 18:31.179
But Ryan claimed
he was hanging out

18:31.179 --> 18:33.250
at his girlfriend's apartment.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.079
That is a little shaky.

18:35.079 --> 18:37.978
But it is nowhere near
enough to move the needle.

18:41.603 --> 18:42.604
<i>Kids here?</i>

18:42.604 --> 18:44.364
They're at my mom's.

18:44.364 --> 18:46.125
Wes is going to pick them up
on his way home, which makes

18:46.125 --> 18:47.367
this the perfect time for
you to tell me why you

18:47.367 --> 18:49.093
think this is all your fault.

18:49.093 --> 18:50.094
I don't.

18:50.094 --> 18:51.337
Come on.

18:51.337 --> 18:52.441
Sit.

18:57.998 --> 19:01.070
There is no way you let a loser
like Ray live under your skin

19:01.070 --> 19:02.900
if you didn't blame
yourself for more than just

19:02.900 --> 19:04.902
lying on a report.

19:04.902 --> 19:11.219
Look, I had been squad
leader most of my second tour,

19:11.219 --> 19:15.050
top performance ratings,
fast track to a promotion,

19:15.050 --> 19:17.673
unless my battalion
commander found out

19:17.673 --> 19:19.986
that a soldier
in my unit was engaged

19:19.986 --> 19:21.884
in rampant criminality.

19:21.884 --> 19:24.473
I thought if I
brought Ray in myself,

19:24.473 --> 19:26.682
I could keep it
within the squad.

19:26.682 --> 19:29.996
No harm, no foul,
and I would be sergeant

19:29.996 --> 19:31.860
first class in no time.

19:31.860 --> 19:37.762
So we went after him,
unsanctioned, under the radar.

19:39.971 --> 19:44.838
We located him in a village
just outside of Mosul.

19:44.838 --> 19:46.668
As soon as he found
out he was trapped,

19:46.668 --> 19:51.914
he called in an airstrike
right on top of us.

19:51.914 --> 19:56.125
It was like the world exploded.

19:56.125 --> 19:59.784
I thought I was
going to die, Angela.

19:59.784 --> 20:01.372
But I got lucky.

20:01.372 --> 20:04.099
The Humvee that Mark and I
were behind, it saved us but--

20:08.483 --> 20:14.282
But Henderson and Coyle,
they were blown apart.

20:17.181 --> 20:18.872
I still don't know
how Ray survived.

20:18.872 --> 20:20.529
I mean, the building
he was in,

20:20.529 --> 20:22.669
it was
almost completely destroyed.

20:22.669 --> 20:26.777
There-- we found his mangled
dog tags in the wreckage.

20:26.777 --> 20:28.296
I mean, there was--

20:28.296 --> 20:31.506
there was so much blood.

20:31.506 --> 20:35.855
Without question,
we thought he was KIA.

20:35.855 --> 20:38.513
I mean, it was--

20:38.513 --> 20:43.828
it was a spectacular failure

20:43.828 --> 20:46.141
of leadership.

20:46.141 --> 20:50.110
I put my career
above my oath and

20:50.110 --> 20:55.357
two soldiers, two decent men,
didn't come home that night.

20:57.808 --> 20:59.188
And I'm going to have
to live with that

20:59.188 --> 21:02.088
for the rest of my life.

21:25.042 --> 21:27.872
What are you
still doing here?

21:27.872 --> 21:29.874
I'm just going over
the Karina Lewis case.

21:29.874 --> 21:31.428
Right.
I heard they found her body.

21:34.189 --> 21:36.916
Detectives questioned
this guy for over ten hours

21:36.916 --> 21:38.193
without his lawyer, right?

21:38.193 --> 21:39.712
He's young.

21:39.712 --> 21:41.369
He's scared.

21:41.369 --> 21:43.405
In retrospect, it's possible
he could have been coerced.

21:43.405 --> 21:44.406
OK.

21:44.406 --> 21:45.856
So take another look.

21:45.856 --> 21:48.376
If he was,
get the conviction overturned.

21:48.376 --> 21:49.894
It's not that simple.

21:49.894 --> 21:51.379
Because you're
running for DA.

21:51.379 --> 21:52.863
Yeah.

21:52.863 --> 21:54.071
And how's it going to look
when it comes out that you

21:54.071 --> 21:55.348
railroaded an innocent man?

21:55.348 --> 21:56.487
Hey, I
didn't railroad anybody.

21:56.487 --> 21:58.040
This was a very solid case.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.733
Based on a possibly
questionable confession.

22:00.733 --> 22:03.391
Yeah.

22:05.669 --> 22:10.294
<i>♪ On my mind</i>

22:10.294 --> 22:11.951
Oh, you really dove in.

22:11.951 --> 22:14.850
Yeah, I wanted to make
an informed decision.

22:14.850 --> 22:15.920
And?

22:15.920 --> 22:19.268
And I'm more sure than ever.

22:19.268 --> 22:20.649
I want to have a baby.

22:23.169 --> 22:24.757
And you don't.

22:24.757 --> 22:26.793
And I don't know.

22:26.793 --> 22:30.003
Some days,
this job is all I can handle.

22:30.003 --> 22:33.628
When I had Henry,
I was the boss.

22:33.628 --> 22:35.802
I never had to miss
a school play or

22:35.802 --> 22:37.908
a parent-teacher conference.

22:37.908 --> 22:39.979
I don't have that now,
which means

22:39.979 --> 22:43.223
I can't be the kind
of dad I want to be

22:43.223 --> 22:45.467
or the cop I want to be.

22:45.467 --> 22:46.779
So that's a no.

22:46.779 --> 22:48.746
It's a big decision.

22:48.746 --> 22:51.473
I just-- I need more than
a day to think about it.

22:51.473 --> 22:53.544
Well, if you are
trying to figure out a way

22:53.544 --> 22:55.926
to let me down easy, don't.

22:55.926 --> 22:58.756
The longer you let me have
hope, the more painful

22:58.756 --> 23:01.828
it'll be.

23:01.828 --> 23:08.835
<i>♪ I won't run,
I won't hide, no, no ♪</i>

23:10.216 --> 23:11.528
Just in time.

23:11.528 --> 23:13.495
I ordered pizza.

23:13.495 --> 23:15.221
Oh, thank you.

23:15.221 --> 23:18.051
I have been dreading
having to cook.

23:18.051 --> 23:19.570
Any news on the Tim front?

23:19.570 --> 23:21.158
Not yet.

23:21.158 --> 23:26.646
So I'm just practicing trust,
patience, and I hate it.

23:28.234 --> 23:29.338
That was quick.

23:29.338 --> 23:30.409
I'm going to get changed.

23:34.033 --> 23:35.068
Hey, there.

23:35.068 --> 23:36.553
I'm Ray.

23:36.553 --> 23:38.451
Tim's friend.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.177
He's not here.

23:40.177 --> 23:42.973
Oh, that's cool.

23:42.973 --> 23:44.871
Lucy?

23:44.871 --> 23:46.010
Yeah?

23:49.497 --> 23:50.808
Can I help you?

23:50.808 --> 23:52.051
I hope so.

23:52.051 --> 23:55.813
You Tim's girlfriend?

23:55.813 --> 23:57.781
Oh, you don't need that.

23:57.781 --> 23:59.058
I'm here to help you,
not hurt you.

23:59.058 --> 24:00.059
Yeah.

24:00.059 --> 24:01.060
I think I'm going to pass.

24:01.060 --> 24:02.958
Um, you need to leave.

24:02.958 --> 24:04.132
Tim never mentioned me?

24:04.132 --> 24:05.754
I have no idea who you are.

24:05.754 --> 24:08.239
So how would I know if he
has mentioned you or not?

24:08.239 --> 24:09.827
Why don't you call Tim?

24:09.827 --> 24:12.312
Ask him about Mosul.

24:12.312 --> 24:13.900
The only phone call
I'm going to make

24:13.900 --> 24:15.868
is for an ambulance
to wheel you out of here

24:15.868 --> 24:19.319
unless you get out right now.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.460
No problem.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.496
You tell Tim to take a knee.

24:23.496 --> 24:24.980
I'm going to be
gone in a few days,

24:24.980 --> 24:29.088
unless he gives me
a reason to stick around.

24:35.957 --> 24:37.199
Who the hell is that guy?

24:41.894 --> 24:42.860
- Uh-oh.

24:42.860 --> 24:45.311
What?

24:45.311 --> 24:46.381
Hey, what's wrong?

24:46.381 --> 24:47.624
Where are you?

24:47.624 --> 24:48.590
Lucy.

24:48.590 --> 24:50.143
Where the hell are you?

24:51.559 --> 24:52.525
What happened?

24:52.525 --> 24:53.733
Your buddy Ray stopped by.

24:53.733 --> 24:54.734
Are you OK?

24:54.734 --> 24:56.391
Do I look OK?

24:56.391 --> 24:58.289
Let's give them a minute.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.015
What if Tamara had
been there by herself

25:00.015 --> 25:01.672
when that creep showed up?
- I'm sorry.

25:01.672 --> 25:03.018
I had no idea.
- No!

25:03.018 --> 25:04.572
No. No more excuses, Tim.

25:04.572 --> 25:06.608
You have to tell me
what's going on with you.

25:06.608 --> 25:07.816
Right now.

25:07.816 --> 25:08.921
Now!

25:12.165 --> 25:13.304
His name is Ray Watkins.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.789
He was under
my command in Iraq.

25:14.789 --> 25:16.515
I thought he was killed
in action, but he's back,

25:16.515 --> 25:17.723
and he's going
to hurt someone if I

25:17.723 --> 25:20.001
don't do something about it.

25:20.001 --> 25:21.416
None of that--

25:21.416 --> 25:23.107
none of it explains
why you cut me off.

25:23.107 --> 25:24.108
No.

25:24.108 --> 25:25.213
It doesn't.

25:25.213 --> 25:26.697
Stop trying
to protect me, Tim!

25:26.697 --> 25:28.112
I'm sorry.
I can't, OK?

25:28.112 --> 25:29.389
I won't.

25:29.389 --> 25:30.805
- You read Lopez in.
- It's different.

25:30.805 --> 25:32.047
How?

25:32.047 --> 25:33.532
She has less
to lose than you.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.569
Please, just steer clear
of this for me, OK?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.570
I can't.

25:37.570 --> 25:38.778
I won't.

25:38.778 --> 25:41.022
You clearly need help,
and I am done

25:41.022 --> 25:42.471
being the good girlfriend, OK?

25:42.471 --> 25:43.611
You don't have
to tell me everything,

25:43.611 --> 25:45.267
but you are going to let me in.

25:50.652 --> 25:51.826
She is about a
year old now, right?

25:51.826 --> 25:52.999
Yeah, that's right.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.104
So she's sleeping
pretty good?

25:54.104 --> 25:55.623
Oh, you really do
not remember what

25:55.623 --> 25:57.348
it is like to have young kids,
do you?

25:57.348 --> 25:58.729
No, I guess I don't.

25:58.729 --> 26:01.007
I'm running on a
cold brew and adrenaline,

26:01.007 --> 26:02.146
but it's worth it.

26:02.146 --> 26:03.734
Right.

26:03.734 --> 26:05.253
Why, are you and Bailey
thinking about having a kid?

26:05.253 --> 26:06.392
She is.

26:06.392 --> 26:08.014
Ah.

26:08.014 --> 26:09.706
I just don't know that I
can juggle a kid and the job.

26:09.706 --> 26:11.362
Well, I manage.
So does Lopez.

26:11.362 --> 26:12.709
So did Grey.
- Right.

26:12.709 --> 26:13.882
But you're younger.

26:13.882 --> 26:15.090
So was he.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.471
Just starting out
in your careers.

26:16.471 --> 26:18.128
I am a little
late to the party.

26:18.128 --> 26:21.441
I've got maybe ten years
to maximize my career

26:21.441 --> 26:22.926
before it's all but over.

26:22.926 --> 26:25.480
Look, it's a cliché,
because it is true.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.551
There's really never a
good time to have a kid.

26:27.551 --> 26:29.518
But you know, you make it work.

26:29.518 --> 26:31.072
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

26:31.072 --> 26:33.005
I know who was sleeping
with Teresa's boyfriend.

26:33.005 --> 26:35.766
So this is her and Mike last
year before she was arrested.

26:35.766 --> 26:37.941
Anything look familiar?

26:37.941 --> 26:40.219
Teresa's mom was wearing
that shirt yesterday.

26:40.219 --> 26:41.841
And Teresa said
she smelled great.

26:41.841 --> 26:43.325
Yeah, because she
smelled like her boyfriend,

26:43.325 --> 26:44.844
and she didn't realize
it until after.

26:44.844 --> 26:46.881
And when she figured it
out, she lost her mind

26:46.881 --> 26:48.537
and took off.

26:48.537 --> 26:50.229
But why go apologize
to Doreen and not go

26:50.229 --> 26:51.851
straight to her mom's place?

26:51.851 --> 26:53.508
Well, we've had a shop
parked outside her mom's place

26:53.508 --> 26:56.235
since she escaped.

26:56.235 --> 26:59.031
But not Mike's place.

26:59.031 --> 27:01.758
Miss Marcos, thanks for
coming in on short notice.

27:01.758 --> 27:03.242
Of course.

27:03.242 --> 27:06.107
You mentioned
this had something

27:06.107 --> 27:09.731
to do with that horrible
Karina Lewis murder?

27:09.731 --> 27:11.112
Yes.

27:11.112 --> 27:12.665
Your boyfriend at
the time, Ryan Jones,

27:12.665 --> 27:14.460
he used to work with Karina.
Is that right?

27:14.460 --> 27:15.668
Uh, yes.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.428
And according
to your statement,

27:17.428 --> 27:21.674
the night of the murder he
was with you having dinner.

27:21.674 --> 27:24.435
Do you recall
what time he arrived?

27:24.435 --> 27:25.747
I don't know.

27:25.747 --> 27:28.647
Um, whatever I said
back then must be right.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.786
Well, you said 6:00 p.m.

27:29.786 --> 27:30.787
OK.

27:30.787 --> 27:33.444
Then it was 6:00.

27:33.444 --> 27:34.825
Why am I here?

27:34.825 --> 27:36.275
They caught the guy.

27:36.275 --> 27:38.760
We actually have new
evidence indicating

27:38.760 --> 27:40.348
that he might be innocent,

27:40.348 --> 27:42.212
new evidence
that implicates Ryan.

27:46.768 --> 27:49.806
He said it--
it wasn't a big deal.

27:49.806 --> 27:52.912
He said that it would make
things easier if I just

27:52.912 --> 27:55.812
said he was there at 6:00.

27:55.812 --> 27:59.091
What time did you actually
see Ryan that night?

27:59.091 --> 28:01.783
Not until 9:00.

28:01.783 --> 28:02.991
Officer Thorsen?

28:02.991 --> 28:03.992
A word.

28:03.992 --> 28:05.131
Yes, ma'am.

28:05.131 --> 28:06.236
Excuse me.

28:10.585 --> 28:11.862
She just blew up Ryan's alibi.

28:11.862 --> 28:13.139
He's our guy.

28:13.139 --> 28:14.554
What are you
doing interviewing

28:14.554 --> 28:17.419
a witness without me?

28:17.419 --> 28:18.489
I'm sorry.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.974
I should have notified you.

28:19.974 --> 28:21.251
Are you really this
dense or are you just

28:21.251 --> 28:22.666
actively trying to jam me up?

28:22.666 --> 28:24.219
No, it's not about you.

28:24.219 --> 28:26.083
This is about an innocent
man sitting in prison.

28:26.083 --> 28:29.224
OK, listen, I know that
this case is personal for you.

28:29.224 --> 28:31.744
But if you keep going rogue,

28:31.744 --> 28:33.712
you are going to ruin
this man's chances

28:33.712 --> 28:36.024
of ever being released, OK?

28:36.024 --> 28:39.614
The paths to a new trial
are incredibly narrow

28:39.614 --> 28:41.858
and almost all procedural.

28:41.858 --> 28:44.412
New evidence,
even overwhelming evidence,

28:44.412 --> 28:45.965
does not guarantee his release.

28:45.965 --> 28:46.966
OK.

28:46.966 --> 28:48.727
Well, that's not right.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.763
No, it is not, but it is the
system that we are working in,

28:50.763 --> 28:52.765
which means that
every step needs

28:52.765 --> 28:56.113
to be carefully considered.

28:56.113 --> 28:57.701
OK.

28:57.701 --> 29:01.222
Well, Ryan's girlfriend just
admitted to lying for him.

29:01.222 --> 29:04.604
She didn't see him
until 9:00 that night.

29:04.604 --> 29:06.020
So what's our next step?

29:09.609 --> 29:10.714
OK.

29:10.714 --> 29:12.405
We-- we need a murder weapon.

29:12.405 --> 29:15.063
If we can match the ballistics
from a .22 in Ryan's

29:15.063 --> 29:18.342
possession with the bullet that
the ME found in Karina,

29:18.342 --> 29:19.792
then we have a case.

29:19.792 --> 29:22.553
But to get the gun,
we need probable cause

29:22.553 --> 29:23.865
to get a warrant.

29:23.865 --> 29:26.005
And right now,
we do not have that.

29:28.836 --> 29:29.975
<i>Brenda's here.</i>

29:29.975 --> 29:31.286
I wasn't even--

29:31.286 --> 29:32.736
Sounds like
Teresa is here too.

29:32.736 --> 29:33.772
You liar.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.807
You're my mom.

29:34.807 --> 29:38.949
My fricking mom!

29:38.949 --> 29:41.400
Control, 7-Adam-15
we have an on view

29:41.400 --> 29:44.506
4-15 family at 1331 Arlington.

29:44.506 --> 29:45.784
You got her pregnant?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.406
I thought you didn't
even want kids.

29:47.406 --> 29:49.339
Honestly, I'm with
Teresa at this point.

29:49.339 --> 29:50.719
Right.
It's just a bat.

29:50.719 --> 29:51.720
Let's split up.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.721
I'm going to go around back.

29:52.721 --> 29:53.722
Oh, wait.

29:53.722 --> 29:54.723
Look at her waistband.

29:54.723 --> 29:56.277
Come on,
say that's enough.

29:56.277 --> 29:57.623
All right,
that changes things.

29:57.623 --> 29:59.038
She's enraged.

29:59.038 --> 30:00.557
It's going to be hard
to get her to calm down.

30:00.557 --> 30:01.903
Get back to the cruiser.

30:01.903 --> 30:03.180
I want you to come
racing in hot after 30

30:03.180 --> 30:04.872
seconds, lights and sirens.

30:04.872 --> 30:07.288
Copy that.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.137
Augh!

30:29.137 --> 30:30.138
Police.

30:30.138 --> 30:31.726
You're under arrest.

30:31.726 --> 30:35.937
And for the record,
you are a terrible mother.

30:35.937 --> 30:37.870
Hey, my guy at State
came through.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.493
Diplomatic plates we sent him
belong to the Turkish embassy,

30:40.493 --> 30:42.254
but the guy in the
car wasn't Turkish.

30:42.254 --> 30:43.807
He was Venezuelan.

30:43.807 --> 30:45.982
Gustav Martinez,
military counterintelligence.

30:45.982 --> 30:47.949
Specialty is cracking
down on anyone considered

30:47.949 --> 30:49.088
an enemy of the state.

30:49.088 --> 30:50.607
Dissidents.

30:50.607 --> 30:52.781
If Ray met with Gustav,
it had to be for a job.

30:52.781 --> 30:54.059
Makes sense.

30:54.059 --> 30:55.819
Gustav can't operate
domestically,

30:55.819 --> 30:57.925
so he hires Ray to kidnap
or kill anyone on the outs

30:57.925 --> 30:59.581
at home.

30:59.581 --> 31:00.893
According to my guy,
the most likely candidate

31:00.893 --> 31:02.619
is Elena Acosta,

31:02.619 --> 31:03.827
<i>political activist.</i>

31:06.278 --> 31:07.693
Hello?

31:07.693 --> 31:09.315
<i>This is Sergeant
Tim Bradford with the LAPD.</i>

31:09.315 --> 31:12.767
We just received a credible
threat on your life.

31:12.767 --> 31:14.079
They're here.

31:14.079 --> 31:15.287
Yell the name
Ray Watkins right now.

31:15.287 --> 31:17.082
Do it.
- Ray Watkins.

31:17.082 --> 31:20.775
Ray Watkins.
Ray Watkins.

31:20.775 --> 31:22.639
No.

31:22.639 --> 31:25.124
Ray Watkins.

31:25.124 --> 31:26.505
Hey, Tim.

31:26.505 --> 31:28.162
<i>We know about
the Venezuelans, Ray,</i>

31:28.162 --> 31:29.715
<i>so let Elena go right now,
and I'll push the DA's</i>

31:29.715 --> 31:31.475
<i>office to go easy on you.</i>

31:31.475 --> 31:34.271
Sorry, buddy, I got a job to
do and a reputation to uphold.

31:34.271 --> 31:35.997
We're gonna have to
let this one play out.

31:35.997 --> 31:38.172
Catch me if you can.

31:44.178 --> 31:45.800
All right, put her inside.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.527
I'll let Neil know the
container is ready to load.

31:59.676 --> 32:00.642
- Get on the ground.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:00.642 --> 32:02.541
Now.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.474
- It's over, Ray.
- Stop.

32:04.474 --> 32:06.062
Show me your hands right now.

32:06.062 --> 32:07.649
Got your entire
crew in custody.

32:07.649 --> 32:09.548
Should have changed it up after
you caught me following you.

32:09.548 --> 32:11.999
Yeah, I get a little
cocky sometimes.

32:11.999 --> 32:14.691
I didn't know you'd
be on me this early.

32:14.691 --> 32:18.591
You know killing me
is your only play here.

32:18.591 --> 32:21.387
I'm not going
to kill you, Ray.

32:21.387 --> 32:25.150
And there's no airstrike
you can call in this time.

32:27.048 --> 32:28.049
Are you kidding?

32:28.049 --> 32:31.225
I am the airstrike.

32:31.225 --> 32:34.297
I'm about to blow
up your whole life.

32:34.297 --> 32:36.955
Sergeant Bradford,
this is a DII,

32:36.955 --> 32:39.612
or Department Initiated
Investigation,

32:39.612 --> 32:41.925
which could result
in discipline.

32:41.925 --> 32:44.721
Your continued
employment with the LAPD

32:44.721 --> 32:48.069
is contingent on your
full and truthful answers

32:48.069 --> 32:49.622
to my questions.

32:49.622 --> 32:50.623
I understand.

32:50.623 --> 32:52.073
I want to be clear.

32:52.073 --> 32:53.592
Other people will
deal with your crimes.

32:53.592 --> 32:55.697
I'm not questioning
you as a suspect.

32:55.697 --> 32:59.253
My job is to investigate
your accusations

32:59.253 --> 33:01.013
against Sergeant Bradford.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.395
On that point,
I am crystal clear.

33:03.395 --> 33:07.847
When did you become aware
that Ray Watkins was alive?

33:07.847 --> 33:08.952
Last week.

33:08.952 --> 33:10.436
I saw him entering a 7-Eleven.

33:10.436 --> 33:14.268
Bradford and Mark Greer
tracked me down,

33:14.268 --> 33:15.994
threatened me
in my mother's home.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.823
Was your mother
there to witness that?

33:17.823 --> 33:20.481
Yeah,
but she's in the hospital.

33:20.481 --> 33:22.966
Doctors say it will be
a miracle if she wakes up.

33:22.966 --> 33:24.002
I'm sorry.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.969
Don't be.

33:25.969 --> 33:27.384
But Mark, he was there.

33:27.384 --> 33:31.699
I haven't seen
Mark Greer in a decade.

33:31.699 --> 33:33.494
I still get the
occasional Christmas card.

33:33.494 --> 33:36.255
According to the FAA,
there's no record of Mark

33:36.255 --> 33:38.085
Greer flying into Los Angeles.

33:38.085 --> 33:40.501
No local credit card charges.

33:40.501 --> 33:43.124
His phone never left
Arlington, and the army

33:43.124 --> 33:46.783
shows him as on base
for the entire two weeks.

33:46.783 --> 33:48.405
Clever man.

33:48.405 --> 33:50.269
He was planning to kill me,
so he covered his tracks.

33:50.269 --> 33:52.961
Did I conspire
to commit murder with a guy

33:52.961 --> 33:54.515
I haven't seen in ten years?

33:54.515 --> 33:55.516
No.

33:55.516 --> 33:57.242
So Ray Watkins is lying.

33:57.242 --> 33:59.727
Little tip when dealing with
Ray, if his lips are moving,

33:59.727 --> 34:01.073
he's lying.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.110
Tim lied on the
after action report.

34:03.110 --> 34:06.147
He said I was killed in action.

34:06.147 --> 34:07.355
I look dead to you?

34:07.355 --> 34:08.839
Why would I lie?

34:08.839 --> 34:10.220
My whole squad had been
hit with friendly fire.

34:10.220 --> 34:11.463
I had lost three of my men.

34:11.463 --> 34:13.051
Technically, two.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.812
Right, but I didn't know
that until a few days ago.

34:15.812 --> 34:16.882
And it shook me.

34:16.882 --> 34:18.642
Ray Watkins was AWOL.

34:18.642 --> 34:22.301
Why not contact military police
when you learned he was alive?

34:22.301 --> 34:24.165
I wanted to be sure
before I sounded the alarm.

34:24.165 --> 34:25.546
Here's the truth.

34:25.546 --> 34:27.548
Bradford wanted to
protect his career,

34:27.548 --> 34:29.826
so he lied about what
actually happened.

34:29.826 --> 34:33.726
He participated in a
cover-up, and he knowingly

34:33.726 --> 34:35.832
falsified official reports.

34:35.832 --> 34:37.661
These are serious
accusations.

34:37.661 --> 34:40.630
Is any part
of what Ray said true?

34:42.149 --> 34:43.219
No.

34:43.219 --> 34:44.254
None of it.

34:56.059 --> 34:58.717
<i>♪ Outcast, nomad</i>

34:58.717 --> 35:02.134
<i>♪ Always a couple of videos
cooking ♪</i>

35:02.134 --> 35:03.135
Hi.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.895
Uh, excuse me?

35:04.895 --> 35:06.449
Hi.

35:06.449 --> 35:11.212
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but um, what are you using?

35:11.212 --> 35:13.111
...44 Magnum.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.699
Is it heavy?

35:15.699 --> 35:18.254
You tell me.

35:18.254 --> 35:23.155
Oh, wow, you must be
really strong to hold that.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.156
I lift.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.537
Oh, OK.

35:25.537 --> 35:27.504
So I am trying
to decide on what to buy,

35:27.504 --> 35:29.403
and I want something
that's light

35:29.403 --> 35:31.405
but still, like, accurate.

35:31.405 --> 35:34.304
Um, .38 is a good option.

35:34.304 --> 35:36.134
OK, I've heard of that.

35:36.134 --> 35:41.484
Um, a friend of mine, she has
a .22 Rutger, and she loves it.

35:41.484 --> 35:45.143
She says it's light enough
to hold in her purse.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.627
Ruger.

35:46.627 --> 35:49.802
A Ruger.
Right.

35:49.802 --> 35:51.321
Yeah.

35:51.321 --> 35:54.773
...22 is a good choice for
a delicate woman like you.

35:54.773 --> 35:56.015
No recoil.

35:56.015 --> 35:58.294
Oh, OK.

35:58.294 --> 36:00.537
Do you have one I could try?

36:00.537 --> 36:04.576
Please?

36:04.576 --> 36:05.577
Yeah, sure.

36:05.577 --> 36:06.612
I have a few with me.

36:06.612 --> 36:08.304
Yeah. OK.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.172
Thank you.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.173
Oh, wow.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.243
That is super light.

36:16.243 --> 36:17.244
Can I?

36:17.244 --> 36:19.625
Yeah? OK.

36:38.265 --> 36:40.888
So I had a chance to look
over the ballistics report.

36:40.888 --> 36:43.304
The bullets that you collected
are a match for the bullet

36:43.304 --> 36:45.133
that killed Karina Lewis.

36:45.133 --> 36:46.894
An arrest warrant
has been approved,

36:46.894 --> 36:49.690
and I will be signing a motion
to vacate the conviction.

36:49.690 --> 36:50.967
Really?

36:50.967 --> 36:52.279
Yeah, I wouldn't have
prosecuted if we'd

36:52.279 --> 36:53.452
had this evidence at the time.

36:53.452 --> 36:54.488
That's awesome.

36:54.488 --> 36:55.972
No.

36:55.972 --> 36:57.560
I probably shouldn't
hug you, right?

36:57.560 --> 36:58.802
Right.

36:58.802 --> 36:59.907
Let us know
if you need anything.

36:59.907 --> 37:00.908
Will do.

37:00.908 --> 37:02.392
And thank you.

37:02.392 --> 37:03.428
No.

37:03.428 --> 37:05.740
Thank you for sticking with it.

37:05.740 --> 37:06.914
Good job.

37:09.779 --> 37:11.332
And your campaign?

37:11.332 --> 37:14.370
Well, doing the right thing,
no matter how difficult,

37:14.370 --> 37:17.856
should be seen as a character
strength, not a flaw.

37:17.856 --> 37:19.167
Nice.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.652
You float that one
by the advisors yet?

37:20.652 --> 37:21.894
Damn right I did,
and they loved it.

37:21.894 --> 37:22.930
Oh, I bet they did.

37:22.930 --> 37:24.518
Big plans this weekend?

37:24.518 --> 37:28.522
Uh, hide in my room,
wear blinders to the kitchen.

37:28.522 --> 37:30.006
I need to move, huh?

37:30.006 --> 37:31.318
Definitely.

37:31.318 --> 37:32.871
What about you?

37:32.871 --> 37:34.321
What's going on with the
whole, uh, baby situation?

37:34.321 --> 37:35.563
Mostly
I've just been avoiding

37:35.563 --> 37:38.256
thinking about it all day.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.879
And now?

37:40.879 --> 37:44.400
And now,

37:44.400 --> 37:48.266
having a kid...

37:50.475 --> 37:53.478
Has been the greatest
joy of my life.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.103
So why would I want
to deny her that?

38:01.727 --> 38:03.936
In light of Ray's
numerous crimes,

38:03.936 --> 38:07.526
his statements against you
appear retaliatory in nature.

38:07.526 --> 38:09.597
Because your after
action reports

38:09.597 --> 38:13.221
have been accepted as factual
by your military superiors,

38:13.221 --> 38:16.121
which there's no evidence
to suggest otherwise,

38:16.121 --> 38:21.506
this DII is closed with a
finding of not sustained.

38:22.265 --> 38:24.819
Thank you, sir.

38:24.819 --> 38:26.614
- Always a pleasure.
- Yeah.

38:26.614 --> 38:28.444
We should get the
wives together soon,

38:28.444 --> 38:29.479
have some dinner.

38:29.479 --> 38:30.653
I would love that.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.073
You know this isn't over.

38:37.073 --> 38:38.419
I know.

38:38.419 --> 38:40.318
You violated procedure
in pursuit of a suspect

38:40.318 --> 38:42.216
and roped in
two other officers?

38:42.216 --> 38:45.184
What if Ms. Acosta
had been killed

38:45.184 --> 38:48.464
because you didn't utilize
proper channels and resources?

38:48.464 --> 38:49.465
It was wrong.

38:49.465 --> 38:50.845
I know.

38:50.845 --> 38:53.848
I'm required to notify
your metro commander.

38:53.848 --> 38:55.436
What she does with
it is up to her.

38:55.436 --> 38:57.611
- Sir--
- You're dismissed.

39:10.589 --> 39:12.557
Come here.

39:17.251 --> 39:19.218
How did it go with IA?

39:22.601 --> 39:25.880
I lied about everything.

39:27.468 --> 39:32.059
But I mean,
it saved my job, right?

39:32.059 --> 39:33.405
Protected you and Lopez.

39:33.405 --> 39:36.684
It was an
impossible situation.

39:36.684 --> 39:40.136
I would have done the same
thing if I was in your place.

39:40.136 --> 39:43.104
You wouldn't have
been in my place.

39:43.104 --> 39:46.073
You never would have put
self-interest over your team.

39:46.073 --> 39:47.695
You thought you
could handle it.

39:47.695 --> 39:51.043
You were wrong, but you
made it right, so it's fine.

39:51.043 --> 39:54.978
Yeah.
I wish it was that easy.

39:54.978 --> 39:59.466
Lucy, I just lied to two men
I deeply respect, OK?

39:59.466 --> 40:01.502
I just betrayed
everything I thought

40:01.502 --> 40:02.883
was right about myself.
- Tim.

40:02.883 --> 40:03.918
No, no.

40:03.918 --> 40:05.195
You got to let me finish, OK?

40:05.195 --> 40:06.196
This is very hard
for me to say.

40:06.196 --> 40:08.095
OK.

40:08.095 --> 40:12.306
Lucy, I've been lying
to myself for a long time.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.067
That's clear to me now,
and I can't--

40:15.067 --> 40:19.831
I can't just go back
to the way things were.

40:19.831 --> 40:22.834
Not right now.

40:22.834 --> 40:25.043
Maybe never.

40:27.286 --> 40:30.497
Wait.

40:30.497 --> 40:32.533
Are you breaking up with me?

40:35.881 --> 40:38.470
I'm sorry.

40:38.470 --> 40:41.024
You don't--
you don't get to do that.

40:41.024 --> 40:46.236
You don't get to lie to me
and then use that as an excuse

40:46.236 --> 40:48.066
to leave me, OK?

40:48.066 --> 40:50.378
That's not OK.
- I know.

40:50.378 --> 40:52.104
I know.
- What you're doing is not OK.

40:52.104 --> 40:54.244
I know.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.731
You-- you are
an incredible person.

40:57.731 --> 40:58.732
No.

40:58.732 --> 41:01.182
No, you're incredible, OK?

41:01.182 --> 41:03.150
You deserve so much better.

41:03.150 --> 41:06.878
Oh my god.

41:06.878 --> 41:07.948
That's why I'm walking away.

41:07.948 --> 41:08.949
Don't do this.

41:08.949 --> 41:13.263
Why are you doing this?

41:13.263 --> 41:14.299
I'm sorry.

41:14.299 --> 41:16.508
<i>♪ I'll get it done</i>

41:16.508 --> 41:18.855
<i>♪ I'll do what I need</i>

41:18.855 --> 41:23.308
<i>♪ So I can breathe freely</i>

41:23.308 --> 41:29.866
<i>♪ So I can breathe
freely ♪</i>

41:33.387 --> 41:35.354
Are you learning
baby sign language?

41:35.354 --> 41:36.424
Maybe.

41:39.289 --> 41:41.568
How about we just forget
about the elephant

41:41.568 --> 41:44.398
in the room for tonight,
make some dinner,

41:44.398 --> 41:46.814
and enjoy some time together?

41:46.814 --> 41:50.093
I think that's a great idea.

41:50.093 --> 41:52.095
But you may want to lay off
the wine if I'm going to get

41:52.095 --> 41:53.338
you pregnant later tonight.

41:55.858 --> 41:57.515
Is that what we're doing?

41:57.515 --> 42:01.104
Oh, yes,
with much enthusiasm.

42:01.104 --> 42:04.073
Are you sure?

42:04.073 --> 42:06.558
Hydrating.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.767
Do we have to wait
till after dinner?

42:10.113 --> 42:11.459
Nope.

42:14.290 --> 42:16.810
Grab my water.

42:16.810 --> 42:18.466
Thank you.

42:18.466 --> 42:19.916
You're in trouble.

42:55.814 --> 42:56.850
<i>Damn it.</i>
