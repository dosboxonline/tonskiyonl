WEBVTT

03:02.433 --> 03:05.519


04:02.534 --> 04:04.870
Well, that's, uh, finished.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.413
The crisis awaits.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.873
Down to work.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.834
It's dinner first.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.920
A working dinner, Edison.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.964
Mmm, really?

04:15.839 --> 04:17.841
- Uh, Tony?
- Yes.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.260
What do you say? Working dinner?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.679
Yes. Working dinn...

04:21.679 --> 04:25.140
Actually, I do have, uh,

04:25.140 --> 04:27.977
just a little surprise for you first.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.061
What is it, Hilda?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.605
This is just a little surprise

04:31.605 --> 04:34.233
on the way to the gazebo.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.443
It's just a short walk.

04:37.277 --> 04:41.281
We should be clear with the communique,

04:41.281 --> 04:43.325
but not so clear

04:43.325 --> 04:46.453
that we put ourselves
in an awkward position.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.455
Yes of course, exactly.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.542
This crisis is not one that
can be classified so simply.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.626
No.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.420
And so we must keep our options open.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.338
What we talk about?

04:56.338 --> 04:58.340
That's the question, isn't it, Antonio?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.217
What are we really talking about here?

05:00.217 --> 05:03.470
What is the true na...

05:04.555 --> 05:06.807
You know, for me, this is quite difficult.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.851
We have many important things to discuss,

05:08.851 --> 05:11.854
things that only we can understand
as world leaders.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.772
And yet we are surrounded at all times

05:13.772 --> 05:16.066
by the storm of questions
and interruptions.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.901
Some privacy would be nice.

05:17.901 --> 05:18.986
Yes.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.320
Yeah...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.364
Cardosa!

05:25.701 --> 05:27.327
Would you excuse me for a second?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.495
Yes.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.414
So, how have you been?

05:30.414 --> 05:33.584
Good, Maxime. How's Eloise?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.503
Oh, she's fine.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.213
Yeah.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.635
You and I haven't talked much
since the Rimini Summit.

05:43.635 --> 05:48.557
Maxime, I, um...
I think we should forget Rimini.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.225
Not forget it. I don't mean that...

05:50.225 --> 05:55.064
It was a meaningful and beautiful thing.

05:55.064 --> 05:58.442
It is something that I needed
very much at the time.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.235
And the consolidated annual report

06:00.235 --> 06:03.363
on Global Partnership is
a document I'm very proud of.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.949
Proud of the work we did. But that's all.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.452
I think we have to move on.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.330
This isn't summer camp.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.540
Of course, we're here to work.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.625
Yes.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.637
So?

06:26.637 --> 06:28.847
Well, this is
a very exciting find.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.558
It's not that exceptionally
rare in the area, but...

06:31.558 --> 06:33.560
Sylvain, you seem to know more

06:33.560 --> 06:36.146
about this curious undertaking
than our host.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.441
Ah, well, in fact I did
come early to have a look

06:39.441 --> 06:40.609
and a short discussion

06:40.609 --> 06:42.611
with the supervising anthropologist, Dr...

06:42.611 --> 06:44.363
- Dr. Boofelfullmen.
- Boofelfullmen.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.240
As you may know, I am writing a book.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.202
It's a kind of psychogeography
of graveyards and burial customs.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.163
I'm sure it will be as fascinating
as all your other books.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.710
So what is this? It's quite gruesome.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.880
Well, this is an example
of what we call bog bodies...

07:01.880 --> 07:03.799
or bog people.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.803
There are many of them
scattered around the North Saxony region.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.013
Oh, dear. It's quite revolting.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.558
Well, it is from the Iron Age.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.726
Is made of iron?

07:14.726 --> 07:18.021
Yes, it almost looks like iron,
doesn't it, Antonio?

07:18.021 --> 07:22.401
But no, it is in fact a mummified body

07:22.401 --> 07:24.611
from the Iron Age, almost 2,000 years ago.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.779
That's right.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.240
The acids in the bog

07:28.240 --> 07:30.784
have entirely dissolved
all the bones in the body,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.744
but have perfectly preserved
the surface details:

07:32.744 --> 07:34.204
all the hair, the skin...

07:34.204 --> 07:35.330
The fingerprints.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.916
The fingerprints of the man or woman.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.084
Well, in this case...

07:40.335 --> 07:41.461
It's hard to...

07:41.461 --> 07:44.256
- It's a male.
- It's a man in this case.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.009
If you look here,

07:47.009 --> 07:51.013
you'll see his penis has been severed
and hung around his neck.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.265
It sounds like a man to me.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.267
Yes, with bog bodies,

07:55.267 --> 07:58.270
evidence of torture and disfigurement
is quite common.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.356
I don't mean to make anyone nervous,
but in some cases,

08:01.356 --> 08:04.401
the bodies appear to be those
of the chieftains or leaders,

08:04.401 --> 08:05.903
sacrificially murdered

08:05.903 --> 08:08.405
for failing to deliver
the promise of a good harvest.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.949
Okay, so we would like
to make another photo

08:10.949 --> 08:12.701
here at the dig site.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.037
Please. And then, on to dinner.

08:15.746 --> 08:16.788
Tatsuro?

08:29.009 --> 08:32.137
I mean, that would be weird,
discovering what this...

08:32.137 --> 08:33.222
You know what I mean?

08:33.222 --> 08:35.224
Somewhere in history,
we'd wanna find where...

08:37.142 --> 08:40.729
Perhaps that's something
that you can bring up after dinner.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.149
Please, please.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.860
And one last photo.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.157
Uh... Hello.

08:53.033 --> 08:59.790
So let me begin by welcoming you all
to Dankerode Castle.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.751
And thank you all for coming,

09:02.751 --> 09:04.628
especially under the difficult...

09:04.628 --> 09:10.592
or somewhat difficult circumstances
of the present crisis...

09:10.592 --> 09:12.636
which, of course...

09:19.017 --> 09:21.061
What about you, Tatsuro?

09:22.229 --> 09:25.023
Well, since the theme
of this year's summit

09:25.023 --> 09:26.149
is regret,

09:26.149 --> 09:28.443
do you have any regrets?

09:28.986 --> 09:32.739
I suppose my biggest regret

09:32.739 --> 09:35.242
is that I never learned
how to ride a horse,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.869
never had a chance,
never had the opportunity.

09:37.869 --> 09:41.331
Always want to, but, uh,
getting a bit too old now.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.499
Oh.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.128
No, no, no, no.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.421
Sylvain?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.426
I regret being a disdainful teenager,

09:53.510 --> 09:54.970
especially towards my father,

09:55.887 --> 09:59.349
who I realize finally now

09:59.349 --> 10:02.019
lived amid difficult circumstances,

10:02.019 --> 10:04.730
teaching at the Department
of Sociology at the Sorbonne.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.899
He was probably a fine man,

10:08.734 --> 10:10.277
and he did not deserve my scorn.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.823
I wish he was alive so I could tell him.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.245
Antonio?

10:23.665 --> 10:27.336
I dress up like Mussolini
to costume party.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.467
Well, you didn't mean any harm,
did you, Antonio?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.761
I think it's a funny costume.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.348
But, Antonio, you can't beat yourself up.

10:39.348 --> 10:42.726
These sorts of sensitivities
that people have,

10:42.726 --> 10:45.270
these sensitivities to history.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.731
I mean, it isn't that
they're not important.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.233
I would never say that. But...

10:56.406 --> 10:57.866
I suppose...

10:59.117 --> 11:00.952
Things are a little different now.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.829
I speak of progress.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.831
I mean, look at us...

11:05.999 --> 11:07.584
America, Germany,

11:08.335 --> 11:11.254
Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan,

11:12.172 --> 11:13.965
Canada...

11:13.965 --> 11:16.843
the Republic of France...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.595
The esteemed leaders of...

11:19.930 --> 11:21.765
each of these great nations

11:22.599 --> 11:25.644
gathered here
around the table, great food,

11:25.644 --> 11:28.355
laughing, catching up with old friends.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.692
Yes.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.694
- We're quite lucky to be here.
- We are.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.240
- We are blessed.
-We are blessed.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.866
Blessed.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.794
Well, I don't mean to change the subject

11:50.794 --> 11:53.672
or to dampen the mood,
but we are also here

11:53.672 --> 11:55.841
to produce a draft outline
of a provisional statement

11:55.841 --> 11:57.384
regarding the present crisis.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.635
We should not forget that.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.555
No, but I think regarding
the statement and the crisis,

12:02.472 --> 12:03.849
it is important to say what we mean.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.100
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.184
It's at times like this

12:06.184 --> 12:10.063
that people look to us
to provide clarity and surety.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.107
- Certainly.
- Exactly.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.692
What I mean to ask is this:

12:14.526 --> 12:16.194
Have we defined the crisis?

12:16.194 --> 12:18.155
Have we determined concretely

12:18.155 --> 12:20.115
or even abstractly of what it consists?

12:20.115 --> 12:22.868
Of what it comprises.
Yes, yes, exactly, exactly.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.508
Maxime, what is it?

12:38.508 --> 12:40.385
Hmm? Huh?

12:40.385 --> 12:41.803
Is everything all right?

12:44.806 --> 12:46.349
Oh, I was just...

12:48.268 --> 12:49.686
Forget it.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.647
No, no, no. Go ahead.
What's troubling you?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.484
I thought I...

12:56.443 --> 12:57.569
Never mind.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.237
It's not important.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.073
We're the G7, Maxime.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.783
Everything is important.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.288
Maxime?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.750
Why don't you just take
a moment and clear your head?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.127
Yeah, okay?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.504
Yeah, I will.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.589
Thank you.

13:19.674 --> 13:20.967
So sorry.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.768
He feels the burden of leadership.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.687
-Don't we all?
- No, it's not that.

13:32.687 --> 13:36.107
It's something a little more personal.
You know?

13:38.235 --> 13:40.695
Tatsuro? What do you think?

13:40.695 --> 13:43.323
Contemplative gaze
means heavy burden.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.994
- Antonio?
- Yes.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.871
- You agree?
- Yes.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.040
So, uh...

13:52.040 --> 13:53.917
It's his final summit, isn't it?

13:53.917 --> 13:55.460
Yes, I think so.

13:55.794 --> 13:56.878
What?

13:57.754 --> 14:00.131
He's, uh... He's going to step down.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.467
Step down? What on Earth for?

14:02.884 --> 14:04.511
It's the scandal.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.263
What's it called? The fixed...

14:06.263 --> 14:09.349
The carried interest scandal.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.685
- Good Heavens!
- What it is?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.937
Tony, you don't want to know.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.648
Yes, well, it's...

14:16.648 --> 14:19.401
quite complicated.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.239
The...

14:25.532 --> 14:27.534
The Senate Ombudsman's office

14:27.534 --> 14:33.123
had taken out an insurance policy
for the purpose of chamber renovations,

14:33.123 --> 14:36.418
but the insurance company
they contracted then themselves,

14:36.418 --> 14:38.587
procured a contract of indemnity

14:38.587 --> 14:40.422
against the original policy.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.673
It's astonishing!

14:41.673 --> 14:45.885
Yeah, but these two insurance companies
had a joint tenancy agreement

14:45.885 --> 14:49.472
with an agency controlled by
a private equity firm

14:49.472 --> 14:52.225
from whom Maxime's
mother-in-law had received...

14:52.225 --> 14:54.102
carried interest.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.105
Outrageous! The very face of evil.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.858
Well, I mean, you joke, Edison,

14:59.858 --> 15:02.027
but it is this it's quite serious for him.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.528
There's talk of proroguement.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.988
Prorogation, exactly.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.364
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.080
Well, should we make some
headway with the statement?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.541
I'm sure Maxime will join us
when he feels restored.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.501
Excellent. Yes.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.920
Now, previously, we discussed
smaller work groups.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.131
- Hilda and I will work together?
- Yeah.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.924
Maxime can join up with us
when he returns.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.718
Tatsuro, you and Sylvain?

15:26.718 --> 15:29.596
Yes. And that leaves you
with Antonio, Edison.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.681
- Is that...
- Oh, fine.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.016
Dante and Hemingway!

15:33.016 --> 15:36.853
Yes!

15:48.323 --> 15:49.991
Hello?

15:55.622 --> 15:56.790
Hello.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.721
We might say first
that it's hard to know where to begin.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.973
Yes! Very good.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.810
It's... It's important to get it right.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.603
We don't want to start with the wrong...

16:18.603 --> 16:20.647
No, exactly. It's just
a provisional statement for now.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.816
And even then, whatever ideas
we come up with now,

16:22.816 --> 16:25.443
are just smaller notions,
which can be edited

16:25.443 --> 16:27.529
and revised and peer reviewed

16:27.529 --> 16:30.990
and anyway can be built up
with more detail later.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.327
Yes. Yes.
So we simply write forward and...

16:35.370 --> 16:37.414
- Yes, exactly. We just...
-Maybe we...

16:37.414 --> 16:39.499
Voila!

16:39.499 --> 16:45.046
...start with some sort of
personal reflection.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.589
- Yes.
- Or experience.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.675
I mean to say, you know...

16:50.093 --> 16:53.805
When I was younger, I was an actress.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.223
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:55.223 --> 17:01.604
And I was in a play about
the immigration experience.

17:01.604 --> 17:06.526
I was portraying a villain,
a problematical scientist.

17:06.526 --> 17:11.948
And I had to deliver
these, sort of, terrible monologues,

17:11.948 --> 17:14.576
you know, racist diatribes,

17:14.576 --> 17:19.247
full of expletives
and offensive terminology

17:19.247 --> 17:21.666
and, you know, eugenical explications

17:21.666 --> 17:24.085
of racial intelligence
and natural hierarchies.

17:24.085 --> 17:28.715
And, well, I can remember
some lines from the play

17:28.715 --> 17:30.967
if, well, if that helps.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.721
Ooh,
and do you think that would be...

17:34.721 --> 17:36.973
appropriate for the statement?

17:40.101 --> 17:43.730
Well, I... I thought, you know,

17:44.355 --> 17:46.816
it was from a celebrated playwright. Yeah.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.528
And I just... you know,
some of the play's themes

17:50.528 --> 17:54.365
you know, there's a political dimension

17:54.365 --> 17:58.578
and the sort of immigration experience.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.914
But no, of course not.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.415
Don't know what I was thinking.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.459
- No.
- Forgive me.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.795
Here comes the cavalry.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.671
Sorry to keep you waiting, ladies.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.632
Oh, no, don't mention it.

18:11.049 --> 18:14.052
Is everything all right? Do you want a...

18:14.052 --> 18:16.721
I could use a drink. Yes.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.725
Excuse me for going off like that.

18:20.725 --> 18:21.851
Oh, don't mention it.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.436
You feel things more than others do.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.521
Yeah.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.398
Is there anyone?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.736
I don't know. It's strange,
I haven't seen anyone for a while.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.821
Yeah.

18:33.738 --> 18:34.864
I'll call Lucien.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.534
He must be with
the delegation at the chateau.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.660
He can send someone.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.622
- No answer?
- No.

18:43.498 --> 18:48.336
Well, you can finish my drink if you like.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.810
Mmm.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.940
Very good.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.319
What you mentioned the other time.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.489
Um... the I.T. and integration...

19:16.489 --> 19:18.908
Yes, yes, yes. Excellent.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.910
How about the framework agreement?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.625
We probably start with the date.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.710
Yes.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.129
I would think that would be
a good idea, today's date.

19:31.129 --> 19:34.299
Start with that. And, um...

19:34.966 --> 19:37.635
Yes, now, Antonio, you're new to this,

19:37.635 --> 19:39.804
but I know these kinds of statements

19:39.804 --> 19:42.473
and people pay no attention
to them at all.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.809
What people want is concrete action.

19:44.809 --> 19:45.894
Yes.

19:45.894 --> 19:49.689
Not vague promises or proposals

19:50.982 --> 19:53.401
and long, drawn-out strategies that...

19:55.278 --> 19:56.821
Offer people the Earth and...

19:58.156 --> 20:00.325
Bought it over people.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.833
So...

20:08.833 --> 20:10.501
- Mr. Edison.
- Excuse me.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.298
Excuse me. You can't swim there.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.382
Oh, no!

20:17.759 --> 20:19.510
That's for the troops to sleep in.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.762
For the troops...

20:21.262 --> 20:23.473
It's a sleep tank for the troops.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.266
Sleep tank for the troops.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.310
Do you have a slip for the sleep tank?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.812
Slip for the sleep tank.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.274
Quarter of nine is when we start.

20:34.984 --> 20:38.112
- And we don't start until...
- Don't start.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.073
...everything is announced.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.785
- Everything.
- All the names...

20:45.453 --> 20:46.871
have to be announced.

20:48.831 --> 20:49.832
Okay.

20:52.210 --> 20:55.838
Sometimes I think, Maxime,
you are too hard on yourself.

20:56.673 --> 21:00.510
You can't solve all the world's problems.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.388
You can't even solve all of
Canada's problems.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.141
You should worry about
your own well-being.

21:09.143 --> 21:12.939
Uh, you and, uh... Eloise?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.945
Eloise wants things

21:19.862 --> 21:21.322
that I cannot give her.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.412
What kind of things?

21:40.049 --> 21:44.178
It's a particular
delicacy from Dankerode.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.263
Pineapples?

21:45.263 --> 21:48.057
No, there's no pineapple.

21:49.976 --> 21:50.977
Oh, Sylvain!

21:52.020 --> 21:53.604
What happened?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.235
I believe we are in a crisis.

21:59.235 --> 22:02.030
Well, we already knew that, Sylvain.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.283
That's why we have these
summits in the first place.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.703
There's always a crisis.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.500
Yes, of course, but...

22:17.128 --> 22:20.590
All right, what happened?
Why are you covered in mud?

22:25.053 --> 22:26.054
It is not mud.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.433
<i>I went off following the wind,
to try and grasp</i>

22:30.433 --> 22:33.603
<i>the pages of notes that
Tatsuro and I had produced.</i>

22:33.603 --> 22:39.025
<i>I was frustrated because Tatsuro and I,
with our brainstorming efforts,</i>

22:39.734 --> 22:43.946
<i>brought forth into the world
and possibly the global community,</i>

22:44.655 --> 22:46.449
<i>some very good ideas for the statement.</i>

22:46.449 --> 22:47.533
Global warming?

22:47.533 --> 22:51.245
More like, bilateral management.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.915
-Okay.
- And global jurisdiction.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.586
What we do is, or should be,

22:58.586 --> 23:01.547
independent of the financial world.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.175
But, you know,
it's hard to nowadays

23:04.175 --> 23:06.844
ignore the domestic opposition.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.138
- And domestic violence.
- Yeah, domestic violence.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.641
You know,
supply chain management,

23:11.641 --> 23:15.770
you know, in the grand scheme
of geopolitical issues...

23:15.770 --> 23:18.898
and those other things
that are really important.

23:20.942 --> 23:23.236
<i>And with the pages blown free,</i>

23:23.236 --> 23:25.530
<i>and scattered around me
in all directions...</i>

23:25.530 --> 23:28.157
<i>like the sound of birdsong
in the forest...</i>

23:29.408 --> 23:31.536
<i>I could remember
only the smallest fragments</i>

23:31.536 --> 23:33.204
<i>of what then seemed to me</i>

23:33.204 --> 23:35.832
<i>as the embers of my inspiration went dark,</i>

23:37.375 --> 23:39.877
<i>a visionary capacity
that would never be restored.</i>

23:41.337 --> 23:42.547
<i>My shoes were filthy.</i>

23:44.382 --> 23:45.466
<i>I was despondent.</i>

24:53.242 --> 24:54.368
Hello?

24:55.578 --> 24:57.079
Hello?

24:57.079 --> 24:58.789
Anyone?

25:10.176 --> 25:11.302
Hello?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.600
Is that you?

25:19.644 --> 25:20.770
Hello?

25:34.742 --> 25:35.785
Hmm.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.162
Is this some kind of joke?

25:38.162 --> 25:39.247
A joke?

25:40.331 --> 25:41.791
No, Maxime.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.168
I would joke at such a time?

25:51.259 --> 25:53.427
I didn't bring my phone.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.513
It's no matter, Antonio,

25:55.513 --> 25:58.349
it wouldn't have helped anyway.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.477
I can bring it next time.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.774
- Hello!
- Maxime...

26:06.774 --> 26:08.526
Anyone?

26:08.526 --> 26:12.071
So, we have been abandoned
here at the gazebo?

26:12.071 --> 26:14.782
Uh, yes, it seems...

26:14.782 --> 26:17.326
Does this happen
often out here, Hilda?

26:17.326 --> 26:19.328
Is it a local custom?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.748
Happen often? No, I...

26:23.624 --> 26:27.670
They just built this gazebo.
We are the first to use it.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.422
At the chateau, you didn't
think to try the phone?

26:29.422 --> 26:31.173
It was dark.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.467
The place was totally abandoned and...

26:33.467 --> 26:35.886
I must say.
I was a little shaken by the...

26:35.886 --> 26:37.638
Yeah, frightening.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.558
And it was one of the people

26:40.558 --> 26:42.893
from the ground that we saw earlier?

26:42.893 --> 26:44.478
Yes.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.981
And it attacked you?

26:46.981 --> 26:49.358
Well, no, not attacked, but...

26:50.192 --> 26:52.320
Or I thought so at first.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.905
I don't really know.

26:54.905 --> 26:58.326
It ended up on me
and we rolled around together.

26:58.326 --> 27:01.537
I swear I could feel it
struggling with me.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.206
Well, shouldn't we all just go
back to the house together?

27:04.206 --> 27:06.417
- No one there.
- We walk out on the road.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.045
No, no. It is 20 kilometers.
It would take hours.

27:09.045 --> 27:12.757
I think there has simply been
some kind of a...

27:13.215 --> 27:14.550
Um...

27:14.550 --> 27:16.052
Some kind of...

27:16.052 --> 27:17.386
Some kind of what?

27:18.846 --> 27:21.098
And we're all together now,

27:21.098 --> 27:23.601
and we have light and we have shelter,

27:23.601 --> 27:26.187
and they obviously know we're here.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.564
So shouldn't we just wait here?

27:28.564 --> 27:30.399
Wait for who?

27:31.442 --> 27:32.818
For the authorities.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.580
- This is what you wrote?
- Yes.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.792
Number one: break it down into steps.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.044
Number two: change your environment.

27:50.044 --> 27:53.839
Number three: create a detailed timeline
with specific deadlines.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.386
Number four: eliminate your
procrastination pit stops.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.181
Well...

28:02.181 --> 28:04.892
I'm certain there was more, but...

28:05.476 --> 28:07.186
Tatsuro, do you remember more?

28:07.186 --> 28:08.562
No, no. I don't remember.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.940
- Wasn't there more?
- I don't remember!

28:10.940 --> 28:14.276
Remember only the phrase,
"procrastination pit stop."

28:15.194 --> 28:16.237
Enough.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.202
I'm going to find some help.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.704
Maxime, wait. We have to stay together.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.125
Then come with me, Cardosa.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.919
I meant we must all stay
together, as a group.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.963
It's not safe.
We don't know what's going on.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.297
You always do that.

28:35.297 --> 28:39.468
You always find a reason
not to be alone with me.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.888
- Maxime, no, I don't.
- You do!

28:43.973 --> 28:47.101
Everything you say to me
is an attempt to push me away

28:47.101 --> 28:48.853
or to escape from me.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.689
In every movement of your body,

28:51.689 --> 28:55.067
there's a haste to be finished with me.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.826
Maxime!

29:05.995 --> 29:09.248
Uh, the house is the other way.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.958
Uh... Maxime!

29:10.958 --> 29:13.043
Hilda, don't! Just leave him!

29:13.961 --> 29:15.754
Maxine!

29:16.922 --> 29:19.049
This happens every time he drinks.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.843
He gets like this.

29:20.843 --> 29:23.387
He gets emotional and he runs off.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.101
Who's there?

30:13.687 --> 30:14.897
Oh, it's you.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.567
Yeah.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.402
Yeah, you're disappointed.

30:31.580 --> 30:35.459
It's better to burn out,
than to fade away.

30:37.545 --> 30:40.172
Oh, Maxime.

30:41.215 --> 30:43.634
Have you done this before?

30:46.637 --> 30:47.638
Done what?

30:47.638 --> 30:51.267
Written this, this kind of note,

30:51.267 --> 30:53.352
the suicide note.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.439
Yeah. I've many such notes.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.400
I write them...

31:00.985 --> 31:03.696
Every time I approach the edge.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.366
I'm sure it looks silly to you.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.076
The quote and everything.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.997
I think it's... It's quite a nice quote.

31:14.665 --> 31:15.958
It's cool.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.668
Very rock and roll.

31:21.463 --> 31:22.798
You seem tense.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.177
Do you think...

31:30.639 --> 31:33.767
Do you think a massage might help?

31:33.767 --> 31:35.394
I don't know.

31:42.318 --> 31:43.944
You are tense.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.410
Is that part true?

31:51.410 --> 31:52.995
What part?

31:53.537 --> 31:58.959
That you view death
with inexpressible serenity?

32:02.296 --> 32:04.131
I don't know. Probably not.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.093
No. Does anyone?

32:09.720 --> 32:12.348
I... I think that's good.

32:16.310 --> 32:20.272
The line about women and minorities?

32:20.272 --> 32:21.565
Yeah.

32:22.524 --> 32:25.110
Too often they get forgotten.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.323
Should we say a little something about...

32:30.824 --> 32:32.284
The private sector?

32:33.702 --> 32:35.245
Nothing major, just...

32:36.955 --> 32:40.334
Some words of encouragement.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.421
Why did you follow me?

32:45.798 --> 32:46.965
What do you want?

33:20.165 --> 33:22.501
And here we are. Cut off. Alone.

33:22.501 --> 33:26.714
Well, I have to say, I didn't expect
to wake up to this kind of thing.

33:26.714 --> 33:30.134
Well, I shall do the leaderly thing
and get us out of this muddle,

33:30.134 --> 33:31.885
as Wolcott men have always done.

33:31.885 --> 33:36.181
Going right back to the first of us
who helped establish the Virginia colony.

33:36.181 --> 33:39.601
By all means, Edison,
my good friend, lead us.

33:39.601 --> 33:40.853
What do you have in mind?

33:40.853 --> 33:43.439
What I have in mind, dear boy,

33:43.439 --> 33:46.734
is that we go back to le chateau together,

33:46.734 --> 33:48.527
and there, we find a comfortable spot,

33:48.527 --> 33:53.365
a spot conducive to the kind of
productive diplomatic colloquy

33:53.365 --> 33:58.662
that befits our station as leaders,
until such time as help arrives. Hmm?

33:58.662 --> 34:00.289
- Uh.
- What?

34:00.289 --> 34:01.665
- The statement.
- The what?

34:01.665 --> 34:03.917
- The provisional statement.
- What about it?

34:03.917 --> 34:06.462
- We haven't finished it yet.
- Is there any point?

34:06.462 --> 34:08.630
We always trot out the same
nonsense anyway.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.048
- Edison!
- Well, we do.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.216
The statement is important.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.260
It shows the world
that we are working together.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.053
It quiets our domestic critics.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.889
But this is an emergency.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.599
We have to wait for
Maxime and Hilda anyway.

34:18.599 --> 34:21.268
We could work on it for
a few minutes here while we wait.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.352
Then, as you say,

34:22.352 --> 34:24.021
perhaps we can finish it
back at the house.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.355
All right. Fine, the statement.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.607
We must have something.

34:26.607 --> 34:29.067
Yes, of course. We've all been
working very hard on it.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.737
Okay. So, I have here...

34:31.737 --> 34:35.032
And this is something I've been working on
with Maxime and Hilda.

34:35.032 --> 34:37.868
Well, it's a kind of framework
for conflict resolution

34:37.868 --> 34:39.787
in a troubled marriage.

34:39.787 --> 34:42.247
- What?
- This is for the provisional statement?

34:42.247 --> 34:46.001
Yeah. I mean, ostensibly,
we have here a number of ideas

34:46.001 --> 34:48.086
for restoring
non-sexual physical affection

34:48.086 --> 34:50.464
in this case, between a husband and a wife

34:50.464 --> 34:52.883
who are having trouble
with sexual compatibility.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.014
This is Maxime's stuff again.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.682
He and Eloise are having problems.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.559
Yes, of course,
all marriages have problems.

35:02.559 --> 35:05.562
But the provisional statement
is hardly an appropriate forum

35:05.562 --> 35:07.231
for devising their solution.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.444
What is that?

35:38.303 --> 35:39.972
Where is everybody?

35:43.934 --> 35:45.143
What the hell.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.604
Looks like there was a struggle.

36:21.305 --> 36:23.015
Hey, who's out there?

36:23.015 --> 36:25.100
Don't shoot! I am Antonio.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.728
Prime Minister Lamorte,
what are you doing down there?

36:27.728 --> 36:29.897
Shh. Follow me.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.941
And I take you to the others.

36:38.572 --> 36:40.824
- Look... Look...
- Oh!

36:45.954 --> 36:48.123
There you are.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.042
You're all right?

36:50.042 --> 36:51.752
Hilda? Maxime?

36:51.752 --> 36:54.713
Yeah. We're fine. What happened?

36:54.713 --> 36:56.465
We sent Tony back to get you.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.841
He's good at keeping out of sight.

36:57.841 --> 36:58.967
Is true.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.886
We had to flee the gazebo.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.389
We were attacked by dark, shadowy figures.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.892
Protesters!

37:06.892 --> 37:08.894
That's what I thought too at first.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.146
But they didn't have signs.

37:11.146 --> 37:13.148
They didn't chant any slogans.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.651
And if they objected to any
specifics in our program,

37:15.651 --> 37:16.944
they didn't say so.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.696
I believe they were protesters,
if a little unconventional.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.324
- They were not protesters.
- What then?

37:22.324 --> 37:24.076
The press? Spies? Goblins?

37:24.076 --> 37:25.369
Shh! This is serious, Maxime!

37:25.369 --> 37:27.329
What were they then? Terrorists?

37:27.329 --> 37:30.624
Something less than terrorists
and something more.

37:30.624 --> 37:31.833
Yeah.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.796
But you say that they attacked you?

37:36.213 --> 37:38.924
Well, attacked...
They loomed, threateningly.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.176
Their demeanor was quite
aggressive, quite hostile.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.679
- Very grumpy.
- They were grumpy?

37:43.679 --> 37:45.347
No, they were violent, more than grumpy.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.349
Very grumpy. Scary.

37:48.517 --> 37:51.186
But hey were people, <i>ja?</i>

37:51.186 --> 37:53.063
Human beings?

37:54.815 --> 37:56.984
They looked like the bodies.

37:56.984 --> 37:59.486
The ones dug up from the ground.

38:12.082 --> 38:14.459
What are we doing here?
Why don't we get out of here?

38:14.459 --> 38:15.836
Because we were waiting for you!

38:15.836 --> 38:16.920
- Sylvain!
- Shh!

38:17.212 --> 38:19.715
You're the ones who ran off
crying like teenagers!

38:19.715 --> 38:21.508
We weren't crying.

38:21.508 --> 38:24.344
We wanted to talk.

38:24.344 --> 38:27.097
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know you had your reasons.

38:27.681 --> 38:31.601
Anyway, we were about to head
back to the castle, but...

38:31.601 --> 38:34.187
That's where they came from.
The protesters.

38:34.187 --> 38:36.732
- They were not protesters!
-So we are cut off.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.109
Trapped.

38:53.206 --> 38:54.916
- What?
- What?

38:54.916 --> 38:57.210
Chocolate cake?

38:57.210 --> 38:59.421
No, no, no, it's not a cake.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.715
It's a kind of a ferry.

39:01.715 --> 39:03.508
Well a raft, actually.

39:03.508 --> 39:07.220
But it goes through the marsh.
Right to the main highway.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.390
Yeah. I've ridden it myself.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.184
- A raft?
- How far is it?

39:12.184 --> 39:17.731
From here?
Um, two, maybe three kilometers...

39:17.731 --> 39:19.775
- Four kilometers.
- ...through the woods.

39:19.775 --> 39:23.612
There's a... There's a path.

39:34.623 --> 39:35.916
Ah, here.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.377
I have a brainstorming exercise

39:39.377 --> 39:40.754
that might help us write the statement.

39:41.171 --> 39:43.090
It's something I picked up
at a workshop I attended

39:43.090 --> 39:46.718
after losing the general election in 2018.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.136
Um...

39:48.804 --> 39:50.514
It's just a word association game,

39:50.514 --> 39:52.974
but with a more directed focus.

39:53.433 --> 39:57.521
Now, since we want to produce material
relevant to the provisional statement,

39:57.521 --> 40:00.232
I'll suggest some G7-themed prompts

40:00.232 --> 40:02.859
for our associative wordplay.

40:02.859 --> 40:08.782
So I have here a list of all
the G7 summit locations

40:08.782 --> 40:13.829
going back to Rambouillet in 1975.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.455
Ah, Rambouillet.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.916
Uh, it was, of course, the G6 back then,

40:17.916 --> 40:19.292
before Canada.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.169
Ah, sorry, Maxime.

40:21.795 --> 40:26.091
You know, the declaration
of Rambouillet remains for me

40:26.091 --> 40:28.760
the most incisive and inspired

40:28.760 --> 40:30.846
in the history of G7 statements.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.015
In these three days...

40:34.933 --> 40:38.895
...we held a searching
and productive exchange of views

40:38.895 --> 40:41.356
on the world economic situation,

40:41.773 --> 40:45.652
on the economic problems
common to our countries,

40:45.652 --> 40:49.531
on the human, social,
and political implications,

40:49.531 --> 40:52.200
and on plans for resolving them.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.578
Ah, Rambouillet...

40:54.703 --> 40:57.581
Yeah, it's a remarkably
prescient statement.

40:57.581 --> 40:58.748
Still relevant today.

40:58.748 --> 41:01.960
Oh, here we go, Rambouillet...

41:06.673 --> 41:08.717
Venice, Montebello.

41:08.717 --> 41:10.886
Anyone can jump in any time,
anything that comes to mind.

41:10.886 --> 41:14.431
Versailles, Williamsburg, London.

41:14.431 --> 41:18.018
Bonn, Tokyo, Venice, Toronto, Paris.

41:18.435 --> 41:20.562
Houston. London.

41:23.648 --> 41:24.900
Another one.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.367
Maxime.

41:59.601 --> 42:00.894
It's safe.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.696
Dead for what, a thousand years?

42:12.364 --> 42:14.032
Two thousand.

42:15.700 --> 42:19.329
Probably more afraid
of us than we are of him.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.499
Imagine what he went through.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.168
The rope around his neck...

42:25.168 --> 42:27.212
And look at the cuts on his...

42:35.387 --> 42:38.014
Do you suppose it's normal
for it to dribble like that?

42:38.765 --> 42:40.392
I'm afraid so.

42:40.392 --> 42:44.604
Could what we just saw have been
be something like groundwater?

42:44.604 --> 42:46.523
draining from the specimen?

42:46.523 --> 42:48.984
Could be. Could be.

42:48.984 --> 42:51.236
Imagine holding it in
for that long.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.571
I can't even make it
through a film.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.115
In fact, when Julie and I went...

42:55.115 --> 42:56.616
Oh!

42:56.616 --> 42:58.576
Sylvain? What is it?

43:00.495 --> 43:01.579
Sylvain, what is it?

43:01.579 --> 43:03.123
I don't know.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.252
I confess I had been feeling

43:07.252 --> 43:10.005
somewhat afflicted after my encounter...

43:13.133 --> 43:14.801
I'm sorry. It's my leg.

43:16.219 --> 43:18.263
Does it hurt?

43:19.347 --> 43:21.766
Oh, it burns! It burns!

43:23.226 --> 43:24.561
My bone.

43:24.561 --> 43:26.896
My leg bone, it feels wrong!

43:26.896 --> 43:28.023
Wrong how?

43:28.898 --> 43:31.943
- Look, you see?
-See? What?

43:31.943 --> 43:34.195
The bone is obviously dissolving.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.031
My leg is flaccid.

43:36.031 --> 43:37.157
Rubbery.

43:37.657 --> 43:38.742
And you can't walk?

43:38.742 --> 43:41.161
Absolutely not! It's out of the question!

43:42.912 --> 43:44.331
Okay.

43:44.331 --> 43:45.999
We don't know what's out there.

43:48.001 --> 43:49.210
At ease.

44:43.890 --> 44:45.225
Thank you, my old friend.

44:47.102 --> 44:48.395
Of course, Sylvain.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.653
You are a complex man.

44:58.655 --> 45:01.324
The way you lurch from positions
of strength and control

45:02.367 --> 45:04.953
to ones of weakness and abandon.

45:06.788 --> 45:07.789
Also...

45:08.456 --> 45:10.041
You are physically strong.

45:12.836 --> 45:15.672
It is a good, comfortable feeling,

45:15.672 --> 45:18.466
to be held in this way by a sturdy man.

45:21.594 --> 45:26.266
One's feelings of uncertainty and anxiety

45:26.266 --> 45:28.184
in the face of an unknowable fate,

45:29.269 --> 45:32.105
these feelings are transformed
into an ecstatic surrender

45:33.440 --> 45:36.651
a profound and thrilling abdication
of responsibility.

45:40.029 --> 45:42.782
Simply put: this abdication

45:42.782 --> 45:45.034
is the secret wish

45:45.034 --> 45:47.745
of all those burdened with leadership.

46:05.722 --> 46:07.390
Mr. Wolcott?

46:07.390 --> 46:09.184
Are you hungry?

46:09.184 --> 46:11.060
I have some meat.

46:11.060 --> 46:14.772
Oh, how very gracious of you, Antonio.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.400
Is this traditional Genovese salami?

46:17.400 --> 46:19.110
I don't know.

46:19.110 --> 46:22.113
I get it off the buffet table
at the hotel.

46:22.113 --> 46:23.573
Oh, you crafty thing!

46:24.324 --> 46:26.576
You're a worthy heir to Garibaldi.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.537
Cardosa, this is for you.

46:29.537 --> 46:30.872
Um...

46:30.872 --> 46:32.207
- Meat!
- Thank you.

46:32.207 --> 46:34.834
Nothing. Tatsuro? For you.

46:40.423 --> 46:43.468
Look, look, look.

46:44.636 --> 46:46.387
I find a wheelbarrow!

46:47.096 --> 46:48.181
Oh!

46:53.186 --> 46:54.437
Oh.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.778
- Cardosa?
- Yes, Sylvain?

47:02.445 --> 47:03.863
May I use your laptop?

47:03.863 --> 47:06.574
Well, it's in my bag.
Do... Do you need it?

47:06.574 --> 47:09.577
Yes. I'm having some thoughts
that might be helpful

47:09.577 --> 47:11.538
for the provisional statement.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.873
Thoughts about my present condition.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.500
Uh, sure.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.386
I'm... sorry.

47:26.386 --> 47:28.805
I'm going to need to rest.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.850
I'm not as young as the rest of you.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.103
Of course, Edison.

47:35.103 --> 47:36.896
We should have thought.

47:38.022 --> 47:40.358
Maybe we can find another wheelbarrow.

47:40.358 --> 47:43.778
Antonio, listen,

47:43.778 --> 47:45.488
it's one thing to wheel

47:45.488 --> 47:47.740
the president of the Fifth Republic around

47:47.740 --> 47:49.367
in such an undignified manner,

47:49.367 --> 47:54.122
but I am the leader of
the world's oldest democracy. Mmm?

47:56.416 --> 47:58.710
Sorry, Sylvain. I'm sure you understand.

48:02.672 --> 48:04.090
I say I'm sorry.

48:06.801 --> 48:08.261
What the...

48:08.261 --> 48:09.929
I don't think he can hear you, Edison.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.764
That's how focused he is right now.

48:11.764 --> 48:13.850
He said he had some ideas
about the statement

48:13.850 --> 48:15.810
and off he went.

48:37.332 --> 48:39.125
-Mr. Wolcott?
- Mmm?

48:39.125 --> 48:41.419
Why you have this accent?

48:42.795 --> 48:44.255
Well...
Shh!

50:21.769 --> 50:26.649
Their ancient seed has
extinguished the flames.

50:27.483 --> 50:28.735
Foul plume.

50:33.781 --> 50:35.116
Did we just see that?

50:35.116 --> 50:37.702
I don't know. I don't know.

50:39.328 --> 50:41.873
What is all this?
What the hell is going on?

50:43.124 --> 50:46.085
A kind of ceremony, I would say.

50:46.085 --> 50:50.298
Some kind of gathering
of like-minded individuals.

50:51.507 --> 50:52.842
Oh!

50:52.842 --> 50:56.596
It might be worth describing what we saw
and putting in the statement.

50:56.596 --> 50:58.097
I strongly disagree.

50:58.097 --> 50:59.640
That is exactly the sort of thing not to

50:59.640 --> 51:01.809
put in the statement,
it would cause a panic.

51:01.809 --> 51:04.228
I do not understand what we just saw.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.563
Exactly, Tatsuro,

51:05.563 --> 51:07.648
that's the only sensible thing
to say about it.

51:07.648 --> 51:11.319
I saw nothing that can't be explained
by the natural sciences.

51:11.319 --> 51:12.612
Yeah.

51:12.612 --> 51:14.697
A trick of the moonlight
playing on a grove

51:14.697 --> 51:17.408
of Spanish moss swaying in the wind.

51:17.408 --> 51:20.953
Or one of those ethnic dances
they have at all of these summits.

51:21.662 --> 51:23.915
Lederhosen and castanets,

51:23.915 --> 51:26.751
and those fans they have in Japan.

51:26.751 --> 51:29.337
Tatsuro, what are they called?

51:29.337 --> 51:31.464
- Fans, yes.
- Exactly, there you are.

51:31.464 --> 51:35.510
I admire your hard-headed
American pragmatism, Edison,

51:35.510 --> 51:37.970
but it's hard to share from my position

51:37.970 --> 51:39.597
here in the wheelbarrow.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.682
What have you got there?

51:41.682 --> 51:45.061
"The provisions of Treaty of Maastricht."

51:45.061 --> 51:47.438
- Oh, Maastricht?
- Yeah.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.028
- What does it say?
- Here.

52:02.954 --> 52:04.497
Celestine.

52:17.426 --> 52:19.387
Celestine!

52:19.387 --> 52:21.514
Celestine? Who is Celestine?

52:21.514 --> 52:23.432
Celestine Sproul.

52:23.432 --> 52:26.060
She's the President of
the European Commission, Antonio.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.770
This must be her briefcase.

52:27.770 --> 52:30.314
Okay. It is G7?

52:30.314 --> 52:33.025
Uh, ostensibly, yes.
It depends who you ask.

52:33.025 --> 52:35.069
The President of the European Commission

52:35.069 --> 52:39.949
has been attending
the G7 summits since 1981.

52:39.949 --> 52:42.535
Roy Jenkins at...

52:42.535 --> 52:45.079
Montebello. A beautiful mountain.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.957
- Yeah.
- And Maxime like her?

52:47.957 --> 52:50.710
Does he like Celestine?
Uh, you could say that.

52:51.794 --> 52:55.965
He used to like her,
but he's over her now.

52:57.925 --> 53:01.679
In my opinion, it was foolish
to have EU representation

53:01.679 --> 53:05.391
before the establishment
of the single market in 1993.

53:05.391 --> 53:06.934
At Tokyo 3?

53:08.352 --> 53:10.354
It's an interesting perspective, Tatsuro.

53:10.980 --> 53:12.982
But of course,
we both know the real reason

53:12.982 --> 53:15.276
you're preoccupied
with that particular year.

53:16.193 --> 53:17.612
Nikkei Collapse?

53:17.612 --> 53:19.071
The lost decade!

53:21.908 --> 53:23.075
He's got the fire.

53:23.075 --> 53:24.285
Maxime, what are you doing?

53:24.285 --> 53:26.287
These are Celestine's private papers.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.539
Cardosa, let him.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.166
We're all cold and tired.

53:30.166 --> 53:33.753
Let us warm our bodies
in the glow of Maxime's passion.

53:33.753 --> 53:35.212
She's a private person.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.423
She wouldn't want them
to fall into the wrong hands.

53:37.423 --> 53:39.050
This is cathartic for you.

53:40.176 --> 53:41.761
You're still angry with her.

53:41.761 --> 53:45.222
And you're taking it out
on her by destroying her work.

53:46.557 --> 53:49.268
You were always jealous of her work.

53:49.268 --> 53:53.397
You pretend to be a feminist,
but you don't like strong women.

53:55.566 --> 53:56.901
I love strong women!

53:56.901 --> 53:59.028
No, no, no, no, no.

53:59.862 --> 54:01.364
I love them too much!

54:01.364 --> 54:03.407
Yes, me too, old boy.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.409
- Maxime!
-Me too.

54:05.409 --> 54:08.829
Uh, we... must not split up.

54:08.829 --> 54:10.122
Maxime!

54:11.457 --> 54:16.087
Do you think it might be illuminating
to view this situation allegorically?

54:16.087 --> 54:17.171
What?

54:17.171 --> 54:22.593
Given that it is quite a simple matter
to consider each of us as personifications

54:22.593 --> 54:24.971
of our respective nations?

54:25.888 --> 54:27.848
How would it be illuminating?

54:27.848 --> 54:30.518
It's important to understand the link

54:30.518 --> 54:33.229
between the self and the symbol,
don't you think?

54:33.229 --> 54:35.064
No.

54:39.443 --> 54:40.861
He's too fast for me.

54:40.861 --> 54:43.197
Canada too fast for Germany.

54:43.197 --> 54:45.574
- What does it mean?
- Doesn't mean anything.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.660
- Hilda...
- Hmm?

54:49.370 --> 54:53.249
You know, you really needn't run after him
every time he does this.

54:54.125 --> 54:56.544
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

54:56.544 --> 55:00.381
I do tend to get a little
caught up in the dramatics.

55:00.381 --> 55:03.384
Germany caught up in the dramatics.

55:03.384 --> 55:05.428
We've seen this before.

55:05.428 --> 55:08.014
I only hope he can find us
when he runs out of steam.

55:08.014 --> 55:10.766
I don't know about you,
but don't feel safe waiting here.

55:16.063 --> 55:17.523
Celestine!

55:45.509 --> 55:47.803
This doesn't make any sense.

55:47.803 --> 55:49.972
There should be helicopters

55:49.972 --> 55:53.476
and search teams.

55:54.810 --> 55:56.228
And if they should find us...

55:58.564 --> 56:01.692
they would find seven or six,
I should say...

56:02.818 --> 56:06.113
huddled, frightened men and women

56:07.156 --> 56:08.199
who have failed...

56:09.575 --> 56:12.661
not only in the writing
of the provisional statement,

56:12.661 --> 56:15.372
which it was their sole duty to complete,

56:15.372 --> 56:21.045
but in most of the fundamental categories
of humanity and decency.

56:21.045 --> 56:23.464
What makes you say that, Sylvain?

56:23.464 --> 56:25.841
We haven't eaten each other.

56:25.841 --> 56:27.384
Or even struck each other.

56:27.384 --> 56:29.678
Even our verbal disagreements
have been courteous.

56:29.678 --> 56:32.598
It's not as if a World War has broken out.

56:32.598 --> 56:34.600
Antonio has been sharing his meats.

56:35.518 --> 56:36.685
You want?

56:36.685 --> 56:38.979
Thank you, Antonio, yes.

56:38.979 --> 56:42.650
I guess I get carried away
with my rhetoric.

56:42.650 --> 56:45.194
It's a blessing and a curse.

56:46.112 --> 56:48.697
The burden of all great leaders.

56:48.697 --> 56:51.242
- What day is it?
- Saturday.

56:53.244 --> 56:55.871
No. No, no, the date.

56:55.871 --> 56:57.248
It's the 21st.

56:58.332 --> 57:01.043
What is it? What is it?

57:02.586 --> 57:04.213
September 21st.

57:04.213 --> 57:08.092
It's Maxime's birthday.

57:10.094 --> 57:12.596
No wonder he's been so sensitive.

57:12.596 --> 57:15.975
Maxime's birthday's
very important to him, Antonio.

57:15.975 --> 57:19.228
And with this whole Celestine business,
I hadn't even made the connection.

57:19.228 --> 57:20.396
What do you mean?

57:20.396 --> 57:23.899
Well, I knew Celestine had been appointed
and that she would be coming, but...

57:23.899 --> 57:25.818
I didn't know Maxime would
find it so difficult.

57:25.818 --> 57:29.947
Well, their relationship
has always been one of tumult.

57:29.947 --> 57:32.867
- Mmm.
- They met during the highly contentious

57:32.867 --> 57:35.703
WTO ministerial conference.

57:37.371 --> 57:39.039
2006.

57:39.039 --> 57:41.041
I didn't know Maxime
ever worked in the WTO.

57:41.041 --> 57:43.460
He didn't. He was a protester,

57:43.460 --> 57:45.546
the leader of a black block cell.

57:45.546 --> 57:49.175
<i>Ja.</i> He was, um, pepper-sprayed.

57:49.175 --> 57:55.014
<i>Ja.</i> And Celestine was with
the Dutch trade delegation,

57:55.014 --> 58:02.021
and they met during a violent encounter
and he became infatuated with her

58:02.021 --> 58:05.357
after she tended to his
rubber bullet wounds.

58:06.734 --> 58:10.029
Back then, you could really
get into a punch-up with protesters.

58:11.614 --> 58:14.575
Brave men and women of high principle,

58:14.575 --> 58:17.786
willing to sacrifice
everything for a cause.

58:18.996 --> 58:22.082
They threw rocks, dressed all in black.

58:22.082 --> 58:23.834
It was striking to see.

58:25.211 --> 58:28.672
Hooded hordes swarming
across endless plains.

58:29.381 --> 58:35.179
I injured quite a few of them myself
and was in turn injured by them.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.932
I should like to have been assassinated.

59:21.016 --> 59:23.185
Too late for that now I suppose.

59:23.811 --> 59:25.562
Wouldn't be sporting.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.606
Assassinated?

59:27.606 --> 59:28.899
Really, Edison?

59:28.899 --> 59:30.109
Yeah.

59:31.360 --> 59:35.781
Instead of this ignominious
sloughing away.

59:35.781 --> 59:38.325
I think of it from time to time.

59:38.325 --> 59:40.369
Arranging things, I mean.

59:40.369 --> 59:44.665
A conspiracy of sly minds in back rooms.

59:45.749 --> 59:47.376
Shots ring out.

59:48.294 --> 59:50.504
Bits of my brain on the tarmac.

59:51.463 --> 59:54.216
And they find some piteous wretch
to pin it all on,

59:54.216 --> 59:57.553
some nutcase with an absurd grievance.

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:01.557
Too many bridges,

01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:04.685
not enough protection for songbirds.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.314
Grandson afraid of picture books.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.943
But here I am.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.695
Plowing on.

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:16.697
You're still
the American president, Edison.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.741
Yeah, I suppose so.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.233
Celestine!

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:59.114
Celestine, it's me, Maxime.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:01.617
Are you all right?

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.703
What happened to you?

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:06.663
Why are you here?

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.375
And what is this large brain
you have with you?

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.044
Where's the rest of your delegation?

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.841
Maxime?

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:21.387
Maxine of the silver tresses.

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:23.305
Yes, it's me, Maxime.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.058
Celestine. It's me, Maxime.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:32.481
A black storm comes.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.359
What happened to you?

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:42.366
I am fearful in mind and spirit.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:46.954
What? I can't understand you, Celestine.

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:54.711
I speak in a new tongue.

01:01:57.131 --> 01:02:01.427
A new dawn is coming.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.264
Okay, come.

01:02:05.264 --> 01:02:07.015
We must catch up with the others.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.267
Okay? Come.

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:09.685
Come.

01:02:10.853 --> 01:02:15.023
In seven days and seven nights,
there will be a surprise attack

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:18.735
by Belgian federal authorities.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.487
Come, okay?

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.825
My pendant!

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:27.703
By which I am known.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.457
The pendant bears my likeness!

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.292
Yeah, that's you.

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:35.878
We mustn't leave her.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.421
We must go, now.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:38.964
See her glistening lobes!

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:41.008
See her nurturing folds!

01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:43.010
Come, Celestine.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:46.597
Hello?

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:48.348
Maxime?

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:53.061
I found her huddled up against
a giant brain.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.146
What?

01:02:55.189 --> 01:02:56.315
Celestine?

01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:58.692
Are you all right? What happened to you?

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:00.694
Um...

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:05.407
There is a diverse consortium
of new interests

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:08.202
from the world of tech and finance.

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:10.287
I am the bearer of their message.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.334
She doesn't understand.
There's something wrong with her.

01:03:15.334 --> 01:03:17.586
She... She can only speak gibberish.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:20.172
I speak in a new tongue.

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:23.300
Gibberish to our ears,
but perhaps there is sense within.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.720
An ancient Iron Age language, I suspect.

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:29.556
Perhaps Dacian.

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:32.100
- Galindian.
- Old Frankish?

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.603
Or Burgundian. Or Skaldian.

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:36.271
Some dead tongue only used

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:39.066
by the shamans
in their pagan fertility rituals.

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:41.652
Sudovian.

01:03:41.652 --> 01:03:42.903
Livonian.

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:44.530
Good! Yes.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:46.281
Ruthenian?

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:49.409
Norn? Frisian? Suebi?

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.036
Wanderooge.

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:53.622
Rotwelsch!

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:56.875
Interesting. The thieves tongue!

01:03:56.875 --> 01:04:00.045
Perhaps. Perhaps.

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:05.592
Swedish. She's just speaking Swedish.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:07.678
Swedish?

01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:09.137
You think they're making a move?

01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:12.766
What would the Norwegians say?

01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:16.645
There is bad blood between the kings.

01:04:16.645 --> 01:04:19.439
-What is she saying?
- Something about a king.

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:22.776
I don't think she's making any sense.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.821
Where did you learn
to speak Swedish, Celestine?

01:04:26.989 --> 01:04:31.326
There was a course at
the Institute for Global Affairs.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:34.329
It was a three day course.

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:38.542
Only the Night Queen can bring peace.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:41.211
The Night Queen?

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.090
Who is the Night Queen?
Are you the Night Queen?

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.134
Shh!

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:49.344
Are you the Night Queen, Celestine?

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:57.894
Astrid.

01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:01.440
Astrid is the Night Queen.

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:10.866
She can mimic the voices of all men.

01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:15.704
She can sing as they would sing.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.083
I think we should just keep moving.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.544
Come! Um, come, come!

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:23.629
Wait!

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:26.590
The giant brain is a game-changer!

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.467
Excuse me!

01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:30.010
Sorry.

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:38.602
What is this about a brain?

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:41.063
I saw it. Not far from here.

01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:42.481
A large brain.

01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:44.816
I took a picture.

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.276
How large?

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.820
Almost the size of a car. A small car.

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:50.739
Huh.

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:54.284
A whale's brain, perhaps.

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:56.244
Fossilized whale's brain.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:57.996
Maybe a cargo plane was bringing it

01:05:57.996 --> 01:06:00.874
to the museum in Wiesbaden
and had some engine trouble?

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.376
- No, there was no wreckage.
- No?

01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:04.086
It looks more like a human brain.

01:06:05.212 --> 01:06:06.672
A human brain?

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.715
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.008
Yeah.

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.053
Very interesting.

01:06:13.053 --> 01:06:17.265
More like a...
A woman's brain, I would say.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:19.476
Why?

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.353
Well, from the size, it's...

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:24.981
it's slightly smaller
than a giant man's brain would be.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.608
It's quite large.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:29.069
Well, to be sure, I'm sure it is.

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:31.613
But of course, the more likely explanation

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:35.283
is that this is some kind of stunt,
a protest stunt

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:37.786
meant to mock, well, to mock us,

01:06:37.786 --> 01:06:39.913
the so-called brain trust of the West.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.206
Of the world, really!

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.669
- Made of latex?
- I don't know.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.006
A new fellowship will rise.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.552
It will lead us for all days to come.

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:55.512
- Mmm-hmm. Yes.
- What is she saying?

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.180
She's very confused.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.057
I don't think she remembers much.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.435
She talks about a coming war.

01:07:03.562 --> 01:07:05.814
Are you not listening?

01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:10.318
The giant brain is a game-changer!

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:13.697
Antonio, I hate to be a pessimist.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:16.616
I hate to dump bad news on you,

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:20.454
but I have a feeling
that something apocalyptic has occurred,

01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:24.541
that there is nobody out there
to rescue us,

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.752
no homes to return to.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:35.844
It is the cold, dark ending
our species rightly deserves.

01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:37.596
Come at last.

01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:40.974
Just as we were getting
to know each other!

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.309
Yeah.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.652
You all right, Edison?

01:07:54.196 --> 01:07:55.822
Yes, I'm fine.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:57.282
Right as rain.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:59.951
But I think I'd like to stay here.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.538
So you lot carry on without me.

01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:04.706
I'll be quite content.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.374
Come on, Edison, don't be stupid.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:07.834
The ferry is not far.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:11.171
I've had a good long run.
I've seen and done my share.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:14.883
Now all I want is to sit here a while,

01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:19.137
fade into a beautiful sleep
and never wake up.

01:08:19.137 --> 01:08:22.682
Become one with the loamy ground.

01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:27.062
My body made into something
useful for a change.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.898
Now you come, Mr. Wolcott.

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:33.401
No, Antonio. Thank you. I shall not come.

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:34.694
Please.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:37.864
Please, Mr. Wolcott, come with us.

01:08:37.864 --> 01:08:40.408
No, Antonio, I won't.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.370
Please, Mr. Wolcott.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:46.957
Antonio, please, just leave me.

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:48.458
I'll be fine.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.836
Do it for me.

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:55.340
Antonio, look, please leave me.

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:01.179
You have to come with us.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.431
- Goodbye!
-It's okay.

01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:05.308
It's okay, Antonio.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.476
Antonio.

01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:09.396
We'll send someone for him
right as soon as we can get help.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:12.524
My friend.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.874
Economy... finance...

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:30.250
Finance.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.552
Economy! Ecology!

01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:44.389
I am having an energy crisis.

01:09:48.977 --> 01:09:50.186
Look!

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:51.855
Oh!

01:09:51.855 --> 01:09:53.023
We're here.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:05.785
Where's the ferry?

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:08.204
It must be on the other side.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.248
And how do we get it back?

01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:13.960
Someone has to bring it back
from the other side.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.339
But we're all here on this side.

01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:20.300
One should be reminded
of the parable

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.218
of the scorpion and the frog.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.012
Shh, Sylvain.

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:25.639
The scorpion, he is...

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.182
Sylvain, save your strength.

01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:29.309
...among other things, a wayfarer.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:31.645
Antonio. Can you take him to a safe place?

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:32.729
Thank you.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.321
Deadly aggression...

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:47.994
Sorry. Sorry.

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:52.499
I disguise you. To keep safe.

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:55.418
Wait.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.881
Uh, who is the best swimmer?

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:01.967
I'll go.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.638
Maxime, are you sure?

01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:10.558
Should someone go with you?

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:14.938
Uh, I only can go backwards.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:20.110
I can swim.

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:25.573
Yeah, well, you might not
have to do too much swimming.

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:26.866
It's not deep.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.077
You just have to grab onto the guide rope,

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:32.080
you have to hold on to it anyway,
follow it, because we don't

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.040
want you getting lost in the fog.

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:38.336
Right.

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.630
Now be careful of your footing

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:44.259
because the bottom is
going to be extremely mucky.

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:45.343
It's, um...

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:48.972
Yeah.

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:52.225
It's not deep.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.602
Chilly!

01:11:55.562 --> 01:11:57.355
Grab behind me, Tatsuro.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:04.070
How far, Hilda?

01:12:04.738 --> 01:12:07.282
Uh, about... 200 meters.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.660
Give us an hour.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.789
If we're not back by then,
you must find another way!

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:17.769
Look!

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.356
Anyone order a ferry?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:30.698
Hah! You are like our "ferry" godmother!

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:36.871
You okay? Did you see anything
on the other side?

01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:40.834
No, the fog is thick there too.
But there's a road.

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:43.962
I left Tatsuro there,
he's going to try to find some help.

01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:45.463
Meet us at the dock.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:47.841
How's Sylvain?

01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:50.343
Uh, not good. He's...

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:53.179
He's been quiet, but he's still breathing.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:56.307
So obviously you can see
the ferry can't take us all at once.

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:58.643
We should be able to make it in two trips.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:02.564
Someone should take Sylvain first.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:20.874
Who is it?

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:23.626
What does it say?

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.420
Maxime, what is it?

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.673
- It says, "help."
- What?

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.175
I can't recognize the number.

01:14:30.175 --> 01:14:32.177
Respond, respond! I'll find mine.

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:34.053
I still have no phone.

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:38.892
"Who are you? Where are you?"

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.354
"My name is Astrid. I'm only seven.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:46.274
"I was left at the chateau all by myself."

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.070
- We can't leave her.
- No.

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.241
- We must save her.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.327
This could be...

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:03.499
"Where are your mom and dad... Astrid?"

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:09.964
Yes. Yes! It makes sense.

01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:12.675
Listen.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:17.722
Do you remember the item 11
on the summit agenda memo?

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:19.349
Um, 11... Yes.

01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:22.268
That was the creation of the road map
for the coordinated something, the...

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:24.187
- The sex crimes thing?
- Yes.

01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:28.566
The preliminary road map
for a coordinated international response

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.526
to major cybersex crimes.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:33.613
Now as part of that conference,
which, of course,

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:35.448
we were too busy to attend,

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:38.493
a group of engineers from LŸbingen

01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:42.163
unveiled an artificial
intelligence chatbot

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:46.292
designed to ensnare pedophiles
via automated text message.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.420
- You mean?
- Yes!

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.173
That could be the chat bot messaging you.

01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:54.384
You know, it seems quite similar.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.928
- But I'm not a...
- Pedophile? No.

01:15:56.928 --> 01:15:58.638
But the bot doesn't know that.

01:15:58.638 --> 01:16:01.975
It uses AI to select likely targets.

01:16:01.975 --> 01:16:05.353
And of course, people like us,

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:07.772
people in positions
of great power like us,

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:10.358
you know, world leaders
and so, we, you know...

01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:13.945
statistics show that we are
more likely to be pedophiles.

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:18.700
So we should ignore it?

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.994
What if it's a real child
who needs our help?

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:24.414
No, in fact, we should not ignore it.

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:30.378
If you can convince the bot
that you are in fact a sexual pervert,

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:35.133
it will automatically alert authorities
and they will come investigate.

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:37.552
- We could be rescued.
- What if it is a real child?

01:16:39.012 --> 01:16:41.347
This is our dilemma.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.641
So we must flirt with the child enough
to convince the bot

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.977
that we are sexual predators,
pedophiles, specifically,

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:47.729
and thus alert the authorities
to our whereabouts,

01:16:47.729 --> 01:16:49.897
but not enough
that in case it is a real child,

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.190
we irreparably traumatize it?

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.775
Yes, exactly.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.571
We must be very, very careful.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.576
"My mum and dad left. I'm all by myself."

01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:05.997
"Stay where you are.
I will come help you."

01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:10.501
Perhaps something...
Something a little flirtier?

01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:12.879
For the bot.

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:22.180
"You seem like a nice little girl."

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.474
Okay, Antonio.

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:27.602
You should take Sylvain across now,

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:29.812
Cardosa and Hilda stay here
with Celestine,

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:32.690
I'll head back to the chateau
for the girl as fast as I can.

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:36.194
No, no, I know the chateau well,
I know the security protocols.

01:17:36.194 --> 01:17:37.737
I should come with you.

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:42.241
You know, it's not far, uh, from here.

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.035
You know. Now we know the way.

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:47.246
A straight line,
and we'll be there in 10 minutes.

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:48.915
Well, I would like to come too.

01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:50.917
Perhaps we can finish
the statement on the way.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.850
"You seem like a nice man.
Looking forward to seeing you."

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:10.520
"Looking forward."

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.979
Would a small child say that?

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.689
I think it's the bot.

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:26.869
Come now, Celestine.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.858
I flee my captors.

01:18:56.858 --> 01:18:58.526
I steal away over the dark earth.

01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:00.862
I was worried this would
happen. Celestine!

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.079
What does this mean to her?
What has she been telling you?

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.958
Uh, she says that this brain

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:18.045
is the seat of power of a new union,

01:19:18.713 --> 01:19:23.593
which is poised to
take its place on the world stage.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.763
Global governance has a new name!

01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:32.477
The concords of the past
shall hold no sway!

01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:34.645
Lisbon is invalid! Amsterdam is invalid!

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:38.232
Celestine says
she has figures that invalidate

01:19:38.232 --> 01:19:42.236
the Amsterdam Treaty
and the Treaty of Lisbon.

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:47.492
All the old political orders will fall,

01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:50.161
she says, in a great inferno.

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:54.373
Well, except, of course,
the Treaty of Maastricht,

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:57.502
which really cannot be
overturned so simply.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:01.756
We bask in the radiance
of your unfading complexion.

01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:03.257
"Please hurry."

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.301
We are washed away.

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:09.764
Into the Earth, into the Hall of Gods.

01:20:10.598 --> 01:20:13.267
"I will be there soon."

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:15.561
Tell her that she must speak
of you to no one.

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:17.522
- It must be your little secret.
- Yeah.

01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:27.406
- No!
- Oh!

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:31.369
Celestine!

01:20:33.246 --> 01:20:35.831
No! Celestine!

01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:59.981
Please! Please! Please!

01:21:08.573 --> 01:21:10.908
Hello?

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:12.034
Speak English?

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:13.536
Yes, I do speak.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:16.122
Oh! Phone, phone.

01:21:16.122 --> 01:21:17.957
Yes, I have.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.295
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:22.295 --> 01:21:23.796
Perhaps say the number

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:26.299
that you want to dial
and I can dial it for you.

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:29.510
Central authorities. Japanese Embassy!

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.470
No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.139
Police, police, police.

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:35.474
Ambulance too. We have a sick man.

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:37.518
French President!

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:39.604
Violent protestors!

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:40.896
Floppy bodies!

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.024
Great big brain the size of a hatchback!

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:46.152
Please. Please, slow down.

01:21:46.152 --> 01:21:48.154
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:50.781
Sylvain?

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.409
You want?

01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:56.454
No?

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.206
Antonio!

01:22:08.299 --> 01:22:09.634
Antonio!

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:11.927
Antonio.

01:22:31.364 --> 01:22:32.573
Edison.

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:34.825
Edison.

01:22:54.053 --> 01:22:58.391
Cardosa, did you read
what Sylvain was writing?

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:01.102
Haven't really had a chance
to look at it yet.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:06.524
Let's have... a look.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.569
What is it?

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:12.530
It appears to be...

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:15.157
a proposal for a monument of some sort,

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.326
a tentative proposal

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:20.287
for the establishment of what
will be when it is completed

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:23.582
Western Europe's largest sundial.

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:26.752
A sundial. That's it?

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.212
Yeah.

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:30.798
There's a lot of speculation
about possible locations,

01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:33.008
groundskeeping concerns, materials,

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.803
a list of artists that might
be commissioned,

01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:39.181
and a long explanation
of how sundials work.

01:23:47.732 --> 01:23:49.108
"Where are you?"

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:54.780
"We are coming."

01:24:21.599 --> 01:24:23.559
What do we do?

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.311
Where are we going?

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:32.777
Maxime, what are you doing?

01:24:38.491 --> 01:24:39.742
Excuse me.

01:24:45.039 --> 01:24:47.917
I understand you're... upset.

01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:53.589
Our presence here
has disturbed you somehow.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.301
Maybe you think of this as your land.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.181
It's your ancestral home, after all.

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:05.100
The... The traditional home
of your peoples.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.561
And that's quite understandable.

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:12.024
And we have disturbed your rest

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:17.613
and somehow upset the balance
of your sacred energies...

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.284
for which affront there can be no excuse.

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:27.248
So that's why we come to you now

01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:30.417
and offer our profound apologies

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:34.004
for the hurt and offense we have...

01:25:36.674 --> 01:25:37.883
Run!

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:48.477
"I am outside.

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:50.813
"Where are you?"

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:52.314
Crap!

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:54.608
Come, come, come!

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:57.027
Try zero-zero-zero-zero.

01:25:57.027 --> 01:26:00.239
Zero-zero-zero-zero!

01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:01.657
Ooh!

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.033
Yes! Yes!

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.203
This way.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:14.962
Astrid!

01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:20.426
Hello?

01:26:28.017 --> 01:26:29.768
Glob?

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:32.313
Here you are! Finally!

01:26:32.313 --> 01:26:34.064
I'm sorry about the mess.

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:36.025
I'm having computer problems.

01:26:36.025 --> 01:26:37.401
Sorry.

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.652
Where's Astrid?

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:40.029
-Astrid?
- Yeah.

01:26:40.029 --> 01:26:42.406
Astrid is the name of the AI system

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:46.952
powering the union's
new predator entrapment chatbot.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:50.080
I asked Astrid to bring you here.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.917
I begged her in fact.

01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:55.669
It was the only way to contact you.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:59.423
Communication has become complicated.

01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:03.719
What's going on? Where's everybody?

01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:06.221
Astrid sent them away.

01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:08.891
Why? How?

01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:12.686
I don't know. She likes to work alone.

01:27:12.686 --> 01:27:14.563
Yet she won't let me leave.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.857
It's not healthy.

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:20.945
She must find me useful.

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:23.030
For what reason? I don't know.

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:25.532
Look at me!

01:27:25.532 --> 01:27:28.953
- Why did she bring us here?
- I don't know.

01:27:28.953 --> 01:27:30.996
Did you do sex crime?

01:27:30.996 --> 01:27:33.123
- What? No.
- I think this is a trap.

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.834
- I think we should just leave.
- No, no, it's not trap.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:37.461
That's her reason.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:40.589
I have my own reason to bring you here.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:42.549
Then what is it?

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.176
What do you want?

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:48.347
I have something to give you.

01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:16.041
"Provisional statement
on the present crisis."

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:17.960
You wrote this, Glob?

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.586
Uh, no, not really.

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:22.006
Computer did most.

01:28:22.006 --> 01:28:24.383
Astrid. She has that power now.

01:28:29.555 --> 01:28:31.432
It says things about the Olympics.

01:28:31.432 --> 01:28:32.933
It says they should be held
every three years

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.476
instead of four.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.854
Three? Wow, good idea.

01:28:36.854 --> 01:28:38.230
They're here.

01:28:41.025 --> 01:28:42.401
Maxime!

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:47.948
So, is there any help coming?

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.826
Help? No help.

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:52.327
What do you mean?

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:55.122
Everything on fire. Many dead.

01:29:09.178 --> 01:29:11.930
So no one is coming?

01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:14.725
We didn't see anyone.

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:18.854
No help.

01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:21.065
No help.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:57.911
Mr. President?

01:30:59.121 --> 01:31:01.206
Oh. Yes, that's me.

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:03.208
Yes, I'm the president.

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:05.127
Hey, you feel better?

01:31:05.127 --> 01:31:07.087
Yes. Thank you, Tony.

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:08.839
Not dead yet.

01:31:10.716 --> 01:31:13.510
You know, I feel as if
I could be president

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:16.638
for another hundred years.

01:31:18.015 --> 01:31:19.683
Bloody term limits.

01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:24.521
There are snacks in these

01:31:26.565 --> 01:31:30.402
and some other goodies.

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:32.321
Thank you, Hilda.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:37.242
- Thank you.
- We get something for our pains.

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:18.533
In case we need it.

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:20.911
What is?

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:23.330
Is vitamins?

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:28.543
No, Tony, um, not vitamins.

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:31.546
Potassium cyanide.

01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:35.634
They hand them out at all the summits.

01:32:35.634 --> 01:32:39.054
When this is over, I retire early.

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:43.141
Spend some time in the mountains.

01:32:45.727 --> 01:32:48.438
I'll probably join the private sector.

01:32:50.524 --> 01:32:53.568
- Hilda?
- Hmm?

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.028
What will you do?

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:24.641
Your notes, Antonio.

01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:26.351
Your statement notes, please.

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:44.745
Cardosa.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:28.557
We, the leaders of the Group of Seven,

01:35:28.557 --> 01:35:31.435
met in Dankerode, Germany,

01:35:31.435 --> 01:35:35.272
from the 21st to the 22nd of September...

01:35:36.648 --> 01:35:39.651
at a critical juncture
for the global community

01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:44.281
to make progress towards
an equitable world.

01:35:47.409 --> 01:35:51.037
If there is one message
that echoes forth from this conference,

01:35:52.122 --> 01:35:55.375
let it be that we, as open democracies,

01:35:55.375 --> 01:35:58.170
adhering to the rule of law,

01:35:58.170 --> 01:36:02.007
are driven by shared values
and bound by our commitment

01:36:02.007 --> 01:36:05.218
to the rules-based multilateral order

01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:08.597
and universal human rights,

01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:12.601
and to eliminating,

01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:14.519
wherever possible,

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:17.063
the procrastination pit stops

01:36:18.064 --> 01:36:20.609
that have interrupted our work
over the years

01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:25.906
and also to cultivating opportunities

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:29.326
for non-sexual physical affection

01:36:29.326 --> 01:36:32.579
and the marriages across
the respective nations

01:36:32.579 --> 01:36:34.414
and ensuring that everyone,

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:39.669
regardless of whether you're a woman
or a minority or something else,

01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:43.757
that everyone has access
to slips for the sleep tank.

01:36:45.634 --> 01:36:49.471
Not to mention the importance
of finding an appropriate venue

01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:51.932
for what will be, when it's completed,

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:56.645
Western Europe's largest sundial.

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:10.867
I know you're afraid.

01:37:13.245 --> 01:37:14.496
I'm afraid too.

01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:20.085
The sky is on fire.

01:37:20.085 --> 01:37:23.004
The water of the ocean is thick and black.

01:37:23.922 --> 01:37:27.467
And death... is all around us.

01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:30.178
Everyone is dying.

01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:32.681
Everyone dies.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.891
It cannot be stopped.

01:37:36.434 --> 01:37:37.686
But I assure you...

01:37:38.645 --> 01:37:40.105
hand to heart...

01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:45.151
that if we nurture the sense
of common purpose and vision,

01:37:45.151 --> 01:37:49.739
that has characterized the discussions
we've had over these two days,

01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:54.286
we have an opportunity
like none we've ever had before,

01:37:54.286 --> 01:37:59.040
to foster competition
in the digital marketplace

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.085
and meet the death of our world

01:38:02.085 --> 01:38:04.796
and species, head on.

01:38:07.257 --> 01:38:09.593
Our vision clear and true,

01:38:10.427 --> 01:38:13.513
our desire steadfast,
our stride unwavering,

01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:19.394
our courage unbounded
and our patriotic hearts aflame

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:21.730
with the strength of kings!

01:38:22.564 --> 01:38:24.441
And queens!

01:38:26.651 --> 01:38:27.694
And queens.

01:38:30.614 --> 01:38:35.201
And with a passion
unflinching and unyielding,

01:38:35.201 --> 01:38:38.204
we will carry ourselves fearlessly

01:38:39.706 --> 01:38:43.418
into the dreadful inferno
that awaits us all.

01:38:48.048 --> 01:38:51.885
It's better to burn out than to fade away!
