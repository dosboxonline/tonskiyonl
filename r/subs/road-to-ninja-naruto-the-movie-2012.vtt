00:35.800 --> 00:37.000
Summoning Jutsu.

00:47.900 --> 00:48.600
What was that?

00:54.850 --> 00:56.800
That is...

01:00.800 --> 01:01.450
Kyuubi...

01:01.700 --> 01:03.500
Destroy the Leaf village, Nine-Tails.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.550
Why?

01:25.050 --> 01:26.600
Minato...

01:29.530 --> 01:30.530
Never mind that now.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.500
Just stay here with Naruto.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.800
Naruto...

01:51.000 --> 01:54.600
Minato... Thank you.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.600
Good luck!

02:01.350 --> 02:03.350
I'll be right back!

02:22.100 --> 02:24.500
I won't let you have your way!

02:32.730 --> 02:34.350
So you've noticed me.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.400
However you won't be getting me here!

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Road to Ninja
 by (S.I.R)

03:23.860 --> 03:28.000
Somebody once asked me what a ninja is.

03:28.800 --> 03:34.900
My Sensei told me that a ninja is one who endures.

03:49.100 --> 03:52.550
I quess the report was right, the Akatsuki are here.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.200
How's this possible?

03:55.200 --> 03:57.730
There are some we already took down.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.700
It's not the time to be figuring that out.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.000
The total number of enemies we have to beat down is eight.

04:04.260 --> 04:07.830
Furthermore, they're all hard to deal with.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.900
For now I've got data on each one of them in my head.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.800
Preparation is complete. We will wait for the order.

04:13.830 --> 04:14.500
Okay.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.500
RASENGAN!

04:15.550 --> 04:16.600
What!?!

04:24.700 --> 04:26.830
I never run away or hide.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.100
All of you sons of bitches, come at me!

04:29.900 --> 04:30.630
And...

04:31.800 --> 04:33.000
My name is...

04:37.930 --> 04:39.930
Uzumaki Naruto!

04:39.930 --> 04:41.400
Ninja!

04:42.000 --> 04:46.300
Seriously! What's he doing? He says he's
  a ninja but he can't even endure.

04:48.630 --> 04:52.700
Well, guess it worked for the best,
 he's a perfect decoy.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.630
Shikamaru?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.630
The chances are against us as a group.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.100
It's best to defeat them one by one separately.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.550
Everyone's got it, right?

05:10.630 --> 05:13.000
Hey, please stop causing trouble.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.600
You really don't think at all!

05:15.700 --> 05:16.490
What did you say?!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.450
Although I'm still hungry, I will begin!

05:20.730 --> 05:22.530
Multi-Size Jutsu!

05:24.130 --> 05:26.500
Human Bullet Tank!

05:26.930 --> 05:29.100
You should quickly head back to your spot, too.

05:31.630 --> 05:32.830
I'm not going to give you time to ready your jutsu,

05:32.830 --> 05:35.750
because you would become a greater problem if I did.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.450
Did you see our awesome combination?

05:44.250 --> 05:45.730
Hinata, keep it up!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.760
 Naruto-kun!

05:50.100 --> 05:52.760
Double Dynamic Entry!

05:58.250 --> 06:02.150
I struggled last time, but I am entirely different
now!

06:02.260 --> 06:04.400
There is no way to defeat somebody who
endeavors!

06:04.510 --> 06:11.540
You said it, Lee. It's time to show them the Power
of Youth!

06:16.110 --> 06:17.500
I'm not letting you escape!

06:17.510 --> 06:19.000
Of course.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.260
That place is...

06:34.260 --> 06:39.500
a cave where my dad and Ero-Senin have trained.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.300
Sorry for wait-- ouch!

06:46.500 --> 06:48.100
Don't act so reckless on your own!

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
Earth Release: Earth-Slyle Wall!

06:55.260 --> 06:57.650
Super Beast Imitating Drawing!

07:04.260 --> 07:06.160
Damn! Then I will--!

07:09.260 --> 07:11.000
What is that?! Go away!

07:11.100 --> 07:14.260
The hand is...!! Hand is!!!

07:16.160 --> 07:18.300
It's the enemy's jutsu.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.000
They've completely disappeared.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.160
We did it!

07:38.160 --> 07:41.000
It seems like we succseded at driving them back.

07:44.490 --> 07:45.700
Kakashi Sensei?

07:47.160 --> 07:50.100
Well... this is kind of strange.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.650
You say that Akatsuki who are for sure dead have
attacked?

07:59.160 --> 08:00.800
How on Earth is that possible?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.160
I have no idea.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.000
They ran away without any counterattack.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.960
I'm not sure whether it was a threat or for
some other purpose.

08:11.060 --> 08:14.060
Let's expand the guard and reinforce the town
patrol.

08:14.160 --> 08:14.700
Okay.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.960
And we still have that bodypart, right?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.750
Take a biopsy and compare it right now!

08:23.750 --> 08:24.400
Yes, Ma'am.

08:31.350 --> 08:32.559
I heard about it, that

08:32.700 --> 08:35.400
Akarsuki turned tails after they were defeated by
you guys.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.159
Yeah well.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.190
It ended too fast, though.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.159
What are you complaining for?

08:41.260 --> 08:42.360
That's my boy for you

08:42.559 --> 08:44.300
you can do It properly when you try!

08:45.600 --> 08:51.160
Isn't Akatsuki a group of all the powerful people?

08:51.300 --> 08:56.160
And you guys made them run away. You did as
well as jounins.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.360
Hahaha, is that so?

08:58.560 --> 08:59.560
Of course!

08:59.760 --> 09:02.160
So we all talked about it.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.300
We have decided to submit letters
 of recommendation

09:04.400 --> 09:06.160
to the Hokage to promote you
 guys to jounin-rank.

09:06.260 --> 09:09.800
Really? Then ar we going to be jounin?

09:10.260 --> 09:11.160
With confidance.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.160
It was decided ith unanimous approval.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.160
Isn't that right?

09:14.460 --> 09:17.000
Ya,Ya, right. I agree.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.860
Ahh, excuse me. Is that...

09:20.960 --> 09:22.000
By the way, I feel kind of bad.

09:22.650 --> 09:25.460
We were the ones who were hesitant at first.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.660
Oh my...Mom...

09:27.860 --> 09:30.260
Sakura always goes around carelessly,

09:30.360 --> 09:31.660
taking off her shoes and trowing thm.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.260
And she never folds the laundry and cleans up.

09:35.360 --> 09:39.200
I worry if she'll do that even when she becomes
jounin.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.150
What are you saying in front of everyone?

09:45.360 --> 09:48.260
Hehe. Sakura can't win against her mom!

09:48.360 --> 09:50.260
You don't have to worry, Honey.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.260
She's got her master to look up to

09:52.360 --> 09:55.860
she'll be alright if even she follows her teachings!?

09:56.000 --> 09:56.700
Nope, just kidding!

09:58.150 --> 10:00.050
Your play of words... hahaha!

10:00.360 --> 10:03.260
Oh my gosh,seriously.You two please stop it!

10:03.360 --> 10:06.260
Your joke is so flat and it's annoying!

10:06.360 --> 10:08.700
Oh my, look how she talks!

10:09.000 --> 10:10.260
Hey Sakura, what are you doing to your parents?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.260
Wait!

10:16.260 --> 10:18.400
This way, stupid!

10:10.360 --> 10:13.260
Shut up! That is none of your business!

10:19.360 --> 10:23.260
It seems like everyone's parents are going to
recomend them to jounin.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.800
What are you going to do about it, Sai?

10:24.900 --> 10:27.100
I'm not sure, because I belonged to Root before.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.000
The way to becoming jounin is different.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.260
Whoa, how are you going to finish all that?

10:48.360 --> 10:49.700
Haha,I can finish them!

10:49.860 --> 10:51.260
Really? Your teeth will rot!

10:51.360 --> 10:52.260
It's alright! Hehe.

11:10.650 --> 11:12.750
Let's go home.

11:12.850 --> 11:13.750
Okay...

12:07.310 --> 12:08.950
I'm home!

12:18.650 --> 12:19.540
Pfu...

12:20.200 --> 12:21.300
 Mom...

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
Did you say that you have something to tell me?

12:31.900 --> 12:33.300
Umm, Iruka Sensei...

12:34.150 --> 12:36.050
well...

12:36.150 --> 12:38.800
Can you write a letter of recomandation for
becoming jounin?

12:38.950 --> 12:40.050
What?

12:40.250 --> 12:44.350
All of my classmates said that their mom and dad
would write it for them.

12:44.450 --> 12:46.350
So I want you to...

12:46.450 --> 12:47.550
No way, I refuse.

12:47.650 --> 12:48.350
Eh...

12:48.600 --> 12:50.150
Why not?

12:50.250 --> 12:53.750
You have to became chunin first, right?!

12:54.250 --> 12:56.350
You've protected the village from Pain, and

12:56.450 --> 12:58.350
you're praised a a hero who saved the village, but

12:58.450 --> 13:00.050
I cannot give you special treatment.

13:00.550 --> 13:02.550
Even your father, the Forth Hokage went from

13:02.850 --> 13:05.350
genin-level to chunin-level,
and jounin-level, and

13:05.450 --> 13:09.350
became Hokage. And he became a hero.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.050
And then he became a rock face.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.900
A rock can't say,"Welcome home!"

13:16.800 --> 13:17.800
You're...

13:18.300 --> 13:21.400
Sometimes I think that...

13:22.670 --> 13:25.450
instead of a parent who is carved on rock and
unable to speak,

13:25.550 --> 13:29.300
it would be better to have a parent who says,
"Welcome home!" when I come back home.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.750
Iruka Sensei, your parents are also...

13:34.800 --> 13:36.250
You moron, stop your rumbling!

13:38.350 --> 13:40.600
Why are you so ill-humored today?

13:41.550 --> 13:42.600
Never mind.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.000
Here is the Ramen!

13:49.250 --> 13:51.200
Naruto ordered the pork-soybean Ramen, right?

13:57.300 --> 14:00.850
Mister! There's no naruto fish cake in it.

14:01.150 --> 14:03.100
I'm sorry about that.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.650
I put on lots of popular menma, instead.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.450
Naruto fish cake is out!

14:14.150 --> 14:18.700
I hate menma! I don't even know menma is made of!

14:18.900 --> 14:20.950
I can't even chew it properly!

14:21.050 --> 14:23.250
So listen here, menma is ...

14:23.450 --> 14:25.850
made out of dried bamboo....

14:26.100 --> 14:28.500
That means it's only a piece of rotten bamboo!

14:29.570 --> 14:31.600
Now, you're the one who's rotten!

14:31.800 --> 14:31.700
Why are you so damn picky?!

14:31.850 --> 14:35.150
Whoa, hey hey. Don't fight in here.

14:35.300 --> 14:39.250
A ramen without a naruto fish cake isn't even a
ramen!

14:41.400 --> 14:43.100
Hey, wait! Naruto!

14:45.000 --> 14:48.350
That fellow. I didn't know he hated menma
that much!

14:51.500 --> 14:53.700
Eh, the money is alittle bit insufficient.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.200
I'll pay the rest.

15:00.750 --> 15:03.300
Why didn't he understood me, 
 Iruka Sensei!?

15:04.550 --> 15:06.650
Have you entered puberty?

15:07.050 --> 15:07.400
Hmm....

15:07.550 --> 15:09.950
Why do you keep beeing defiant?

15:10.150 --> 15:11.900
I'm not a kid.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.070
Where are you going?

15:14.250 --> 15:16.250
Mom hasn't finished talking!

15:19.450 --> 15:21.500
This is my life, so stop meddling.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.330
Sakura!

15:27.050 --> 15:27.950
Sakura-chan...

15:28.150 --> 15:29.750
Stop there a second, Sakura!

15:31.600 --> 15:33.000
Let's go!

15:33.500 --> 15:36.100
I'll go on a date with you, so just folow me!

15:36.850 --> 15:41.350
I'll go, but It doesn't look like we're going to have much fun...

15:41.400 --> 15:42.300
Shut up!

15:42.400 --> 15:43.750
Auch...

15:44.450 --> 15:47.550
This is venting your anger on me. That's not a
date at all!

15:47.700 --> 15:50.700
Hey, let go, Sakura. It hurts, it hurts!

15:57.050 --> 15:57.950
Sakura-chan...

15:58.100 --> 16:00.800
Do you think it's alright leaving like that?

16:01.250 --> 16:02.850
Just leave her alone.

16:03.050 --> 16:04.550
She always acts like that.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.800
She meddles in every single thing I do.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.350
And she isn't satisfied unless things work out the way
she wants.

16:10.950 --> 16:13.350
And my dad, too.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.000
Would it hurt if he was sometimes on my side, too?

16:16.210 --> 16:19.100
He does everything my mom says in the end.

16:19.580 --> 16:22.250
He's a genin who doesen't even have a chance at
becoming a jonin.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.800
I want him to do things for me.

16:25.150 --> 16:25.950
Hey...

16:26.150 --> 16:30.450
I wish I could respect my parents like others do.

16:31.100 --> 16:34.000
It would be allot better without parents at all!

16:34.150 --> 16:36.800
Sakura, aren't you speaking too harshly?

16:37.950 --> 16:39.900
What? Are you on my parent's side?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
What do you mean by side?

16:41.000 --> 16:41.850
 I was just--

16:41.850 --> 16:45.500
Ahhh, of all people, why is it you, Naruto, who's
here?

16:48.100 --> 16:51.650
If it was Sasuke, he would have understood me.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.500
What?

16:57.300 --> 17:00.000
Long time no see, Uzumaki Naruto.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.400
You are! Madara!

17:08.050 --> 17:09.700
Rasengan!

17:13.750 --> 17:15.200
You still seem to be the same.

17:15.349 --> 17:16.849
HELL YEAH!

17:25.750 --> 17:28.099
Don't think about causing any trouble in this
village.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.500
This is a bit off from my expectations, but it
doesn't matter.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.200
What have you done?

17:57.140 --> 18:00.000
What the heck was that?

18:01.050 --> 18:04.400
Madara, that jerk. Where did he go?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.800
Maybe he's hiding somewhere nearby!

18:06.900 --> 18:08.400
Let's hurry and tell everyone!

18:10.750 --> 18:12.900
Hey.What are you doing here?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.450
Great to run into guys...

18:15.550 --> 18:18.500
We're in a serious pinch! Madara appeared!

18:18.650 --> 18:19.250
Huh...

18:20.150 --> 18:22.550
Hey, didn't you hear what we just said?

18:22.750 --> 18:26.800
Of course I did. By the way, 
what is this Madara?

18:26.900 --> 18:28.400
Something to eat?

18:28.500 --> 18:31.500
This isn't the time to make stupid jokes!

18:31.700 --> 18:32.700
As I told--

18:33.700 --> 18:35.200
It hurts!!!

18:37.600 --> 18:38.200
Akamaru?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.850
You moron, Akamaru! Do you wanna die?

18:41.500 --> 18:44.100
Why do you bite me all the time?!

18:46.600 --> 18:47.850
What did you say, you moron?

18:47.950 --> 18:50.450
I'd rather not see your ugly face too!

18:56.950 --> 18:59.500
Did you...have some trouble with Akamaru?

18:59.650 --> 19:02.300
What d you mean trouble? This always happens.

19:02.700 --> 19:06.650
Seriously, I wanted to be born as a cat shaman.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.550
A cat?

19:08.050 --> 19:11.950
Because Kiba is a cat shaman to the bone!

19:12.050 --> 19:13.000
By the way,

19:13.000 --> 19:13.650
And...

19:13.750 --> 19:15.850
What are you two doing here?

19:16.150 --> 19:18.450
Don't tell me that you guys are having a date.

19:19.050 --> 19:21.670
No way! That's out of the question.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.550
If you ever flirt with him, I'm gonna kill you.

19:26.650 --> 19:28.450
Heh...

19:29.450 --> 19:31.000
Be honest and say it!

19:31.150 --> 19:32.250
What the--

19:32.450 --> 19:34.400
Hey guys! Calm down.

19:34.650 --> 19:37.750
Hey! Why are you covering for her?!

19:38.150 --> 19:38.950
Heh!

19:39.850 --> 19:42.100
Sakura-chan! You go first...

19:42.250 --> 19:43.950
That's what I'm thinking.

19:44.430 --> 19:47.450
By the way, a guy and a girl being together at night
means...

19:49.000 --> 19:51.050
They're running away?! Just as I thought, it was a
date!

19:51.200 --> 19:53.000
Stop there right now!

19:54.100 --> 19:55.750
I hate being ignored.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.200
Whoops...

20:13.700 --> 20:15.300
What' wrong with her?

20:15.600 --> 20:19.050
Were they normally like that?

20:19.250 --> 20:20.150
No way!

20:20.350 --> 20:22.100
Hey Choji!

20:22.750 --> 20:25.900
Let's go eat some beef!Beef!

20:26.000 --> 20:30.650
At the barbecue, they'll let us eat as much as we
can if we pay them only 1500 yen.

20:30.850 --> 20:33.500
If the three of us go and do dutch pay, then...

20:33.650 --> 20:35.250
ummm...so...

20:36.050 --> 20:37.450
It's 500 yen.

20:37.650 --> 20:41.050
Anyways, I don't really want to do it that way.

20:41.250 --> 20:44.450
I only eat tiny bird-like amounts. It's a waste.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.350
What are you talking about?

20:46.550 --> 20:51.250
Even if we could only eat 5 servings, it's still a
great deal!

20:51.450 --> 20:54.100
Am I pig? How would I eat 5 servings!?

20:54.250 --> 20:55.500
Hey guys, please....

20:57.050 --> 21:00.750
We're mature now.  We shouldn't fight.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.700
Did you just see that? Why is she being so shy?

21:03.950 --> 21:04.880
Yeap...

21:07.100 --> 21:08.000
Sakura-chan!

21:08.300 --> 21:11.200
Well, well, if you guys are free, you
wanna join us?

21:11.850 --> 21:12.450
I got goose bumps?

21:12.650 --> 21:16.500
Let's go,huh! It will be more tasteful if we all go
together!

21:17.350 --> 21:20.400
Yeah, ever since Madara disappeared,

21:20.600 --> 21:22.300
everyone's acting weird.

21:22.730 --> 21:23.950
Yeah, I think so too.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.000
Come with us, hmm?

21:26.150 --> 21:30.850
Ahh well, guys. A while ago, Madara came up and
disappeared.

21:31.050 --> 21:34.600
Hmm? Hmm? What is Madara?

21:34.950 --> 21:38.000
You know, the cool sea guy!

21:38.100 --> 21:38.950
Ah...

21:39.050 --> 21:40.850
That's a fish!

21:40.950 --> 21:43.500
You guys really don't know?

21:43.500 --> 21:48.100
Did something happen? Both of you guys are
somewhat weird.

21:48.250 --> 21:51.050
We were always like this. The ones who are weird
are--!

21:59.850 --> 22:05.420
Sakura, since you're the daughter of a hero who
saved us, you should do well!

22:07.900 --> 22:09.050
The daughter of a hero?!

22:10.050 --> 22:11.000
Look!

22:11.650 --> 22:12.050
Huh?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.800
What?! That's my dad!

22:28.450 --> 22:30.900
How is this possible?

22:35.050 --> 22:38.600
You guys. Why are you blowing hype here?

22:43.550 --> 22:44.650
Sasuke-kun!?

22:44.950 --> 22:47.950
How can you be here?!

22:50.850 --> 22:53.400
Are there any problems, that I'm in my own village?

22:53.750 --> 22:56.650
W..Well...Not really. Though...

22:56.950 --> 23:00.100
Pshaw. You look as if you've seen a ghost.

23:00.250 --> 23:01.950
Sakura! Menma!

23:02.150 --> 23:05.750
W..What? You called me Menma?

23:07.450 --> 23:08.950
Menma: boiled and dried bamboo shoot food.

23:10.600 --> 23:15.000
Ahhhh. It feels so exciting even if I was the one
who did it!

23:15.250 --> 23:20.800
Tenten, don't throw things like that. You might
hurt yourself.

23:21.050 --> 23:22.950
A bathhouse...

23:23.050 --> 23:27.450
I came with them because everybody said they
were going. And to see how things go.

23:30.050 --> 23:32.450
You still have a perfect flat-chest!

23:32.550 --> 23:35.050
Flat.... ?! What did you say?

23:35.250 --> 23:40.050
I have my eye on Menma, so remenber that you
flat-chested lady.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.950
That again, this Hinata isn't to be messed with!

23:50.350 --> 23:53.650
So did everyone come except Fuzzy Eyebrow?

23:53.950 --> 23:58.050
It's not unusual, because that guy is a hard-
working insect!

23:58.650 --> 24:00.350
I hate that kind of insect!

24:00.550 --> 24:03.550
You really are small both there and in brain.
 How cheap!

24:04.850 --> 24:08.550
Menma look. Tada! These are cat's ears!

24:08.700 --> 24:09.550
Phew. Yeah, yeah.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.300
Huh...Really?

24:12.500 --> 24:14.900
What's the matter with you?

24:16.350 --> 24:18.450
Fine. This time, it's a
lion!

24:18.550 --> 24:19.900
Roar! Roar!

24:20.750 --> 24:26.150
If I'm forced to listen, I would rather hear you
barking like a dog!

24:26.250 --> 24:29.650
Whoa..!!!

24:33.600 --> 24:35.400
Strike!!!

24:45.150 --> 24:47.880
Shikamaru, stop playing around.
You're not a one or

24:48.080 --> 24:51.810
two-year-old baby. The water
overflowed because of you.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.150
Sorry, sorry!

24:54.350 --> 24:55.650
It can't be helped.

24:56.650 --> 24:58.050
Multi-Size Jutsu!

24:59.300 --> 25:03.250
This is so cool! It looks like it's flooding! So cool!

25:03.350 --> 25:07.300
Ah... Kiba's a cat shaman! Shikamaru's an idiot!

25:07.400 --> 25:09.750
My head's so dizzy just from looking at
them!

25:10.000 --> 25:13.250
You're one to talk!? 
You clumsy idiot!

25:13.450 --> 25:16.100
Your temper is still the same.

25:16.550 --> 25:21.400
Does this mean there could be some who didn't
change?

25:21.650 --> 25:25.150
No, No! This way! Face this way!

25:25.750 --> 25:27.850
I said we don't have any special relationship!

25:27.900 --> 25:31.200
You liar! I know you have views on Menma!

25:32.150 --> 25:34.000
Hmm?! This sense is...! No way!

25:34.250 --> 25:35.650
She found out!

25:35.750 --> 25:38.650
Neji, you jerk! I'm going to kill you!

25:47.400 --> 25:48.400
What happened?!

25:48.550 --> 25:50.900
Ouch...It hurts...

25:51.250 --> 25:52.900
Why is Lee here?

25:53.000 --> 25:56.400
You bastard, Rock Lee! You said 
you were going to train...

25:56.500 --> 25:57.850
Instead, you were peeking !!!

25:58.050 --> 25:59.950
N-No way!

26:00.150 --> 26:03.500
I was on my way home after the training, but
 I got accidentally sidetracked!

26:03.650 --> 26:05.300
It's an accident!

26:05.450 --> 26:07.700
Do you train on the top of the bathhouse?

26:07.950 --> 26:10.550
Before I'll kill,Neji! I'm getting
 you first!

26:10.650 --> 26:12.250
Hey! What happened?!

26:13.800 --> 26:15.300
Lee was just sneaking a look at us!

26:15.400 --> 26:17.150
What?! That bastard!

26:18.750 --> 26:20.150
You're not one to talk, yourself!

26:20.350 --> 26:22.250
Wait a sec, Hinata-sama.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.250
Jerk! He just fled!

26:24.450 --> 26:26.350
Guys, let's catch him!

26:29.450 --> 26:31.250
What's happening, seriously?

26:31.350 --> 26:35.000
It seems like our classmate's personalities turned
to the complete opposite!

26:35.100 --> 26:37.550
All of them? Sasuke too?

26:38.000 --> 26:44.450
No, he didn't change at all. He was being full of
himself as usual.

26:44.950 --> 26:51.650
Really? Then what if Lee also didn't change? He's
being falsely accused.

26:51.850 --> 26:53.550
Sakura, Let's go!

26:56.350 --> 27:00.350
Did you think you could escape us without
any jutsu?!

27:00.650 --> 27:02.550
I'm very disappointed, Lee!

27:02.700 --> 27:05.450
You were sneaking a look too, ho could you say
thar?!

27:05.600 --> 27:06.900
It's a misunderstanding, everybody.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.030
I was training by jumping over the roves and
  I got trapped on something.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.900
So that's why I fell accidentally, into the 
girl's dressing room.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.500
I don't want to hear your excuses!

27:15.630 --> 27:17.100
Wait! Wait a second Hinata!

27:17.400 --> 27:19.300
Menma!?

27:19.400 --> 27:20.600
You should calm down guys.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.700
He could be right.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.350
Sakura-san...

27:26.200 --> 27:29.400
I'm pissed off. If It's not true, you're going to die
by my heand.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.600
Stop it. Lee's not kind of person--!

27:32.700 --> 27:33.600
Heh...

27:36.750 --> 27:39.630
What the heck? Why are you wearing my
underwear?!

27:41.350 --> 27:43.150
I'm pretty sure he stole it from the dressing room.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.150
Lee you pervert!

27:54.950 --> 27:59.150
This is driving me nuts! It feels like I'm going to
become completely crazy.

27:59.950 --> 28:02.700
This isn't the sort of thing I know how to handle.

28:02.900 --> 28:06.030
Sasuke's in the village, my name is Menma!

28:06.150 --> 28:09.700
How on Earth did this happened!?

28:11.600 --> 28:14.500
At the moment...we might have been
 dragged into

28:14.700 --> 28:16.300
a different world becauseof Madara's jutsu.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.300
That is the only explanation I can make.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.300
What do you mean a different world? What kind of
world is it?

28:21.450 --> 28:22.850
Of course, I'm not too sure.

28:23.050 --> 28:25.900
So far, we don't have enough information.

28:26.150 --> 28:29.900
Then we better get more information from now on.

28:30.100 --> 28:33.700
Yeah let's do that. And remember 
your name is forbidden

28:33.800 --> 28:36.100
in front of others so don't say it out loud.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.600
What?! What should I do then?

28:38.700 --> 28:41.500
Well, your name is Menma here!

28:42.000 --> 28:46.300
So, you should try to get information that we
want. Got it, Menma!?

28:48.350 --> 28:50.900
Even you, Sakura.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.450
Oh it's you, Sakura!

29:21.550 --> 29:21.900
Yes!

29:23.500 --> 29:24.700
Here you go.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.300
Are you giving this to me for free?

29:26.400 --> 29:32.000
Don't worry about it! Your parents saved our town!

29:32.300 --> 29:35.100
That's worth more than enough!

29:38.800 --> 29:42.200
Oh I see. They're heroes.

29:49.000 --> 29:49.900
Sakura!

29:51.100 --> 29:53.050
You should take off your shoes properly!

30:08.200 --> 30:11.800
Sigh... but I'm Uzumaki Naruto.

30:16.400 --> 30:20.200
Hold on. If Sakuras dad became a hero and saved the town...

30:20.300 --> 30:21.300
That means...

30:54.100 --> 30:55.900
Dad! Mommy!

30:58.400 --> 31:00.100
Kya...

31:00.600 --> 31:02.300
Who the heck are you?!

31:02.600 --> 31:05.800
I-I but the one who lives here!

31:05.900 --> 31:12.300
What? What the heck are you saying, this is my
house! Go away! Take that!

31:18.300 --> 31:24.900
I don't even have my room now? What is wrong
with this world?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.000
This is impossible!

31:27.500 --> 31:28.600
Shut up!

31:46.400 --> 31:51.900
Good job, guys. I was able to trap him with your
assistance.

31:58.230 --> 32:02.400
Unlimited Tsukuyomi's test, Limited Tsukuyomi!

32:02.500 --> 32:07.300
This world is an interesting place, where everyone
 behaves curiously strange.

32:07.700 --> 32:12.500
Using the power of 7 bijuu, I
created in this Dimension,

32:12.700 --> 32:17.200
an other world. in which I shifted their bodies.

32:17.450 --> 32:23.990
By the way, it seems like that world is not exactly
the same as this world.

32:24.200 --> 32:29.800
For example, they are like this small stones.

32:32.300 --> 32:36.950
It's natural for the quiet water to ripple if I throw a
stone at it.

32:37.100 --> 32:38.000
I think I get it.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.900
Then, i should start soon.

32:43.100 --> 32:46.230
But this is strange.
Though that world is made

32:46.330 --> 32:50.600
by you, you cannot
control it as you like.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.800
Didn't I say that? It's only a test.
However, I

32:56.010 --> 32:59.100
will not let them have the
the upper hand!

33:16.600 --> 33:19.200
I'll use my secret jutsu.

33:21.500 --> 33:26.900
Do you dream to control the ninja world by
collecting all of the bijuu?

33:27.100 --> 33:30.100
What an obvious dream that is.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.900
You have a better brain as a ghost... Who are you?

33:35.700 --> 33:40.400
What does it matter? By the way, I will lend you my
power to you.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.800
Hmm? This is...

34:05.200 --> 34:09.800
Forth Hokage

34:14.199 --> 34:15.600
It's Sasuke!

34:19.630 --> 34:21.699
What's up this morning?

34:22.100 --> 34:24.600
I was worried about your blue face yesterday.

34:25.100 --> 34:27.900
You didn't worry about me, did you?

34:28.900 --> 34:33.500
Just tell me your troubles. Because I'm always on
your side.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.500
Sasuke-kun!

34:44.600 --> 34:47.800
Sleeping out in the open inside of the village. It
doesn't even make sense.

34:48.050 --> 34:50.199
Yeah. You went through many troubles.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.150
Why are you talking like it's not your business?

34:53.199 --> 34:55.300
Weren't you lonely by yourself?

34:56.699 --> 34:59.900
I'm not sure about lonely, but it was so
comfortable.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.900
You were comfortable?! What is wrong with
everybody?!

35:06.300 --> 35:11.000
Cheer up. Anyways, let's organize our
information.

35:12.300 --> 35:18.400
This place is made by Madara's jutsu, but it seems
like the villagers aren't our enemies.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.100
We don't know anything about anyone here,

35:21.400 --> 35:24.800
 but they seem to know about us.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.100
Moreover...

35:26.400 --> 35:30.800
Ahh! What beautiful sight it is!

35:31.400 --> 35:34.000
That painting looks like he drew it with his foot.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.100
Is that so? I don't have any art sense.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.000
Is that a landscape painting?

35:38.200 --> 35:41.800
Well, I don't have any art senses.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.900
Everybody is somewhat unusual.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.400
Stop there!

35:55.680 --> 35:56.100
Damn!

35:56.200 --> 35:57.800
Let's go, Naruto!

36:00.500 --> 36:02.700
I hate people escaping like I hate insects.

36:03.700 --> 36:07.700
Hey, Sakura-san! Let's play!

36:11.200 --> 36:15.200
The thing that changed most is the others
 attitude toward Sakura.

36:15.700 --> 36:18.300
A hero's daughter, Sakura! Give me a handshake!

36:18.500 --> 36:20.000
Okay. Cool.

36:20.200 --> 36:25.950
When I grow up, I want to be like Sakura.
How can I be like that?

36:26.150 --> 36:33.700
What? Well, do your best, study, train 
and if you got guts and spirit

36:33.900 --> 36:35.100
you'll do great!

36:35.200 --> 36:36.900
Super!

36:37.200 --> 36:38.900
I will try my best! Bye!

36:39.200 --> 36:40.900
Good luck!

36:42.400 --> 36:45.600
By the way, you look like you're enjoying this
situation right now.

36:46.700 --> 36:52.900
What do you mean? I'm just pretending to be the
daughter of a hero.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.900
Really?

36:55.200 --> 36:57.900
Honestly, I enjoyed it a bit.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.700
It doesn't seem like it's
that dangerous so far

37:02.100 --> 37:04.800
and it's pretty cool to
live like this so...

37:05.200 --> 37:13.200
Come on! This is the fake world we came to 
 by Madara's jutsu!

37:13.330 --> 37:16.630
I know. Just saying.

37:16.830 --> 37:20.350
Anyways, I don't want to stay here any longer!

37:20.550 --> 37:22.300
Pff... Where are you going?!

37:22.500 --> 37:26.400
To get more information! We don't have time to
play here!

37:28.500 --> 37:30.950
Wait for me.

37:49.200 --> 37:57.300
Since he's locked in my jutsu, the Nine-Tails is
almost mine.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.800
That means you can get it whenever you want.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.800
We don't have to hurry!

38:03.900 --> 38:06.000
There are  many ways to get what I want!

38:07.200 --> 38:11.100
making Uzumaki Naruto submit  and 
obtaining the Nine-Tails!

38:13.100 --> 38:17.400
The best way to get information quickly is to ask
Granny.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.000
What do you mean by that??

38:20.200 --> 38:23.000
Has Lighting Nation's Bijuu been stolen?!

38:25.500 --> 38:27.500
What did you mean by that?

38:27.700 --> 38:28.300
Menma!?

38:28.400 --> 38:29.800
The bijuu got kidnapped?

38:29.900 --> 38:31.500
Did something happen to Mister Bee??

38:31.700 --> 38:36.430
Calm down. I heard that what has been stolen is
the female junkiriki!

38:36.530 --> 38:38.130
Tsunade-sama!?

38:38.250 --> 38:43.150
Since the battle will occur soon, there is no reason
to hide it.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.700
To fight?! Who in the world against?

38:45.900 --> 38:50.760
You know of the masked man
who is recently messing up

38:50.900 --> 38:55.000
 the nation by using many
exclusive jutsu, right?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.730
A masked man?

38:57.030 --> 39:00.160
He's an S-ranked criminal.

39:00.800 --> 39:04.100
Who thought he would get his hands on the bijuu!?

39:04.600 --> 39:09.630
Bijuu and mask. Sakura, maybe he's...

39:09.730 --> 39:13.400
You're right! As you said, Madara doesn't
 exist in this world!

39:13.600 --> 39:18.400
but as you're Menma here, his name
 could have changed too!

39:18.730 --> 39:21.100
Where is that jerk right now?

39:21.500 --> 39:25.200
Forget it! He's not a kind of man you can deal
with.

39:25.450 --> 39:29.300
Many people, including we, have tried to remove
him.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.950
However Jiraiya, who is one
of the three Legendary

39:33.150 --> 39:34.350
ninjas, was not able to
survive and come back.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.100
Ero Senin was...

39:38.730 --> 39:41.300
Jiraiya said that when he was alive

39:41.530 --> 39:45.230
there is only one way to knock the masked man
down.

39:45.800 --> 39:50.300
Using the Red Moon Scroll is the way, he said.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.000
Both of you, welcome back!

40:02.200 --> 40:03.800
We completed the mission.

40:05.250 --> 40:05.900
Heh?...

40:07.830 --> 40:10.350
They are my dad and mom...

40:10.630 --> 40:12.200
Alive?!...

40:13.650 --> 40:15.000
Eh--

40:15.400 --> 40:18.830
Is that the right thing to say to your parents who came
back after completing a mission??

40:19.650 --> 40:22.100
I see, in this world...

40:22.800 --> 40:25.000
Can you tell me about that more in detail?

40:25.900 --> 40:30.000
Jiraiya Sensei told me that he heard the prophecy
at the Myoboku Temple.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.300
The Great Toad Sage predicted that
the masked man could

40:33.400 --> 40:35.530
only be defeated by the Red Moon Scroll!

40:36.400 --> 40:38.800
The Great Toads prophecy is absolute!

40:40.300 --> 40:46.850
To follow the prophecy, Sensei got the Red Moon
Scroll by risking his life.

40:47.400 --> 40:53.550
However, he could not come back to the village
and died there because of serious injuries.

40:53.830 --> 40:56.030
Then, where is the scroll?

40:56.600 --> 41:00.140
It would be hidden at the border of the Fire Nation.

41:00.730 --> 41:03.000
That means you solved the password!

41:03.950 --> 41:06.400
We suffered to solve it, though.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.500
Minato and Kushina. You
two go get it right after

41:10.700 --> 41:14.500
Kakashi and Guy come
back from their mission.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.500
That mission! Let me go too, Granny!

41:17.850 --> 41:19.380
Naruto! Why would you want to go there?

41:19.800 --> 41:24.000
I can't just stand here. The jutsu will be over if we
stop the person who used it!

41:24.100 --> 41:27.000
We finally found a way to return to
the real world!

41:27.600 --> 41:28.800
That's true.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.000
Granny...

41:31.000 --> 41:33.700
I can't let you go!

41:34.900 --> 41:37.250
I also ask you for permission.

41:37.530 --> 41:38.300
Minato!

41:38.700 --> 41:43.000
Don't worry. We'll come back with the scroll.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.430
Okay then.

41:45.730 --> 41:47.800
Thank you for your permission.

42:10.600 --> 42:14.630
I was surprised. Umm, i didn't think your
parents would--

42:16.000 --> 42:18.630
Madara, that jerk!He's playing around with
people!

42:18.730 --> 42:22.400
Seeing those fakes...

42:23.700 --> 42:24.600
I know.

42:27.930 --> 42:35.750
I should hurry back to get that scroll and get out of here
before Madara get's it!

42:51.900 --> 42:55.800
There are people who shouldn't be in the village
and dead people are alive.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.600
What kind of place is this?

43:07.930 --> 43:09.900
Naruto's parents are alive.

43:11.100 --> 43:13.600
I wonder he's doing right now.

43:17.700 --> 43:21.300
Stop acting like that and come out, Menma. I said
dinner is ready.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.000
I said I'm not hungry so just leave me alone.

43:25.350 --> 43:27.900
I won't sit down and laugh with those fakes.

43:41.430 --> 43:46.130
How dare you disobey me? You must be out of
your mind to act like that.

43:47.250 --> 43:53.260
You better listen to your mom. You didn't forget
her nickname is Red Blood Sea, did you?

43:53.360 --> 43:57.000
You're going to eat with us, right?

43:57.200 --> 43:57.800
Yes!

44:02.300 --> 44:03.300
I'm done.

44:03.500 --> 44:06.100
Menma, get the dishes if you have some.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.360
Do it yourself!

44:09.450 --> 44:12.800
You don't seem happy. Did you fight with Sakura
or something?

45:01.050 --> 45:03.700
It's unusual that you're looking at those albums.

45:04.100 --> 45:06.300
It's fine. Not really!

45:07.900 --> 45:12.600
Oh, why did you ask Granny to let me go with you?

45:13.400 --> 45:15.600
Of course it was because I though you had
reasons.

45:15.800 --> 45:20.200
My son is not the sort of child who begs without
having reasons, right?

45:20.400 --> 45:21.900
What are talking about?

45:22.400 --> 45:24.950
Well, it's a parent-child relationship.

45:42.700 --> 45:45.500
Great! Let's go with energy!

45:45.760 --> 45:52.700
There is no energy left. It's hard to keep receiving
missions. We aren't even young.

45:53.100 --> 45:55.600
Don't be so down! Let's
 work hard!

45:55.900 --> 45:57.700
Did they switched each other?

46:04.700 --> 46:06.300
What's with that look?

46:06.600 --> 46:10.200
You should go with the courage to look nice for a
hero's daughter.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.350
Stop touching me!

46:12.600 --> 46:15.700
What's wrong with him? Did he enter his
rebellious phase?

46:19.560 --> 46:21.800
Hey, you shouldn't--

46:22.000 --> 46:25.200
Doesn't matter cause, I'm
 not Menma1

46:26.300 --> 46:27.800
Naruto...

46:39.200 --> 46:45.500
Thanks. I was able to find the bijuu because
of your info.

46:45.700 --> 46:49.000
There's nothing I don't know about this world!

46:50.760 --> 46:56.800
So I'll give you some advice. You will be in trouble
soon,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.860
Are you talking about the Red Moon Scroll that
was in the prophecy?

47:01.610 --> 47:04.310
The enemy has already started to move.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.600
Is that so?!

47:11.500 --> 47:14.600
The Red Moon Scroll is over there.

47:14.800 --> 47:18.400
Sensei has naturally set some traps!

47:18.610 --> 47:21.800
Kakashi, you go first and scout with
 your Sharingan the front.

47:22.010 --> 47:23.510
Understood!

47:24.760 --> 47:26.660
That what I'd like say but,

47:26.900 --> 47:31.600
I've been overusing the Sharingan and I'm
 too worn out!

47:32.060 --> 47:35.400
You really become helpless in the important
phases.

47:35.500 --> 47:38.000
Damn it! I overdid too...

47:38.900 --> 47:41.600
I'm also old now.

47:43.200 --> 47:46.400
Alright, let's get some rest then.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.400
Ummm, where's Menma?

47:51.260 --> 47:53.800
Ahh, seriously.

47:58.260 --> 48:00.800
There's no time to dawdle!

48:02.200 --> 48:03.900
Is that it?

48:16.200 --> 48:17.900
Toad Boss!

48:21.200 --> 48:22.030
We fell a step behind!

48:22.330 --> 48:24.160
Menma, you're too careless!

48:24.360 --> 48:25.300
We fell a step behind!

48:25.500 --> 48:27.800
Since he rushed here alone, it 
 can't be helped!

48:28.000 --> 48:33.600
We're ninja from the Leaf village. We came to get the scroll, Jiraiya left for us.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.900
I don't know of such an arrangement.

48:36.200 --> 48:41.900
We just got asked to protect the document!

48:42.200 --> 48:43.900
Boss Toad! Talk with me a little--

48:44.200 --> 48:46.800
Shut up!

48:48.300 --> 48:50.900
Since it came to this,

48:51.200 --> 48:52.600
there no other choice!

48:52.800 --> 48:53.900
There's more than one way to get through them!

49:13.400 --> 49:14.900
The number is enormous!

49:15.200 --> 49:17.900
I can barely move.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.500
Still, I don't want to hurt them.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.500
All of them are toads that Jiraiya asked me to take
care of.

49:31.900 --> 49:32.500
No!

49:32.800 --> 49:33.800
Wait for a second!

49:35.600 --> 49:37.100
Menma!

49:38.800 --> 49:40.500
Let me go through, Boss Toad!

49:40.800 --> 49:43.500
You Kid! Why are you trying to be friendly?!

49:44.800 --> 49:46.800
Even Boss Toad is different in this world.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.800
Then, I'll show him my Sage Mode.

49:52.600 --> 49:56.300
Where are you?! Where did that kid go?!

49:59.900 --> 50:01.300
Whip of love!

50:01.800 --> 50:04.400
I almost had it!

50:05.900 --> 50:07.400
Take that!

50:08.250 --> 50:09.300
Menma!

50:16.500 --> 50:17.600
Kushina!

50:20.900 --> 50:21.800
Minato!

50:27.800 --> 50:33.500
W...why...why did you save me and--

50:33.800 --> 50:35.300
Stay back, Menma!

50:35.600 --> 50:36.300
But...

50:36.600 --> 50:40.800
It's alright to stay with Kushina. I will handle this.

50:44.400 --> 50:46.300
You pest!

50:55.900 --> 50:57.500
We lost him!

51:06.600 --> 51:11.300
It's a sealing jutsu that is combined with space-
time jutsu and chain jutsu.

51:12.300 --> 51:15.900
I guess it would only be Jiraiya Senseu and I who
can unseal this.

51:36.900 --> 51:40.800
Good job. I got the Red Moon Scroll.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.100
Are you alright?

51:56.400 --> 52:02.400
I think Kushina just got a slight burn. But you
know that even if I don't say it, right?

52:02.600 --> 52:07.800
Please leave me alone. It's none of your business!
Stop being like that!

52:08.000 --> 52:13.200
She was injured through her own action! I could
have dodged that attack if I was alone!

52:18.400 --> 52:21.800
I can't just leave you alone.No matter 
what happens,when

52:22.000 --> 52:25.300
we want to protect someone our bodies just move!

52:25.600 --> 52:27.800
That's what a parent is.

52:29.500 --> 52:33.100
Why are saying such things to me?

52:35.000 --> 52:36.800
Is it weird that I'm the one who is saying this?

52:37.500 --> 52:38.800
That's not what I meant:

52:39.900 --> 52:41.000
Why...

52:44.800 --> 52:49.560
Never act dangerously like that.
I've talked with Kushina, that we

52:49.860 --> 52:55.400
will write a letter of recommendation
for you to become a jounin.

52:56.300 --> 52:57.800
Menma!

53:04.800 --> 53:07.800
I've already scolded him.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
This kid is seriously...

53:11.800 --> 53:15.200
Thank god you didn't get injured.

54:00.300 --> 54:03.200
Thats a real close parent-child 
 relationship!

54:09.800 --> 54:12.000
Jiraiya can now fully rest in peace.

54:12.200 --> 54:18.100
Then let's get our army ready! We can finally
defeat the masked man!

54:19.100 --> 54:21.900
No, let's wait for an opportunity.

54:22.300 --> 54:23.900
Oportunity?!

54:25.600 --> 54:30.250
The prophecy isn't over yet. There is the next
 sentence in the prophecy.

54:30.560 --> 54:34.100
"The Scroll will open is when
the red moon comes out."

54:34.400 --> 54:37.950
I will store this until then.

54:51.400 --> 54:56.100
Although we barely got the Red Moon Scroll, it
seems like we have to wait again.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.350
Yeah...

54:58.300 --> 55:01.900
Even more I don't know when 
fthe moon will turn red.

55:02.100 --> 55:04.300
Tomorrow, we can ask Tsunade-sama...

55:04.500 --> 55:08.100
Sakura, I'm sorry but I have to go today...

56:46.400 --> 56:47.800
You came home early today.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.300
Dad, Mom.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.700
Welcome home, Menma.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.500
Good to be home!

57:32.600 --> 57:36.300
I heard that Konoha has the Red Moon Scroll.

57:36.500 --> 57:39.900
Then I should get started.

57:50.500 --> 57:58.400
Limited Tsukuyomi produces things that one
individual mostly wants at that instant.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.900
A world they sincerely wish for.

58:01.200 --> 58:08.200
Thats why when their yearnings are fulfilled, 
they can't leave!

58:08.400 --> 58:14.800
For their desires, humans are enchanted without
any resistance.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.900
My favorite food gets unappetizing if I eat it too
much.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.400
The hero's daughter.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.900
Naruto.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.500
Did you always felt like this?

59:32.100 --> 59:33.000
Sasuke-kun!

59:35.930 --> 59:38.200
What a player you are, Sasuke.

59:38.400 --> 59:43.800
I'm serious. Remember that I'm always on your
side.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.500
I'm sorry, Naruto. I was wrong.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.300
Let's hurry and go back to our world.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.100
I'm sorry, Naruto! Let's g--

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.950
I'll blow these out now!

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.200
What should I do? Were the words that I said
before a problem?

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.300
Naruto's dream is...

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.500
What do you mean you had something important
you wanted to talk about?

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.400
Actually, I'm kinda busy today.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.500
It seems that way.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:07.400
I was just thinking of
spending my extra time...

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.950
Naruto, are you happier living in this world?

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:18.900
What? Hahaha how stupid are you. What a joke.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:39.000
Here, there's everything I always 
wanted! Everything!

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:50.800
There's Dad, and Mom. I always wanted to live like
this!

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.900
It was my dream.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.500
But this place is...

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:12.900
I know it's a fake world. But I--

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.300
You are...!

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.300
Thanks for taking the document out of the device.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.100
There. I should get the Red Moon Scroll back.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.900
Hokage-sama! We cannot give you back th Red
Moon Scroll!

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.900
Strange for small fries!

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.600
Guy!

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400
Hokage-sama!

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.100
Damn it!

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.950
Go ahead and finish them!

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.700
No way! He blew our chakra out with just one
attack!

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.900
I will kill you this time. Be obedient and hand over
the Red Moon Scroll.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:10.800
Then that guy is...

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.800
No way! That's not Madara!

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.800
Madara? Do you guys know him?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.700
You! Do you know Madara??

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.700
He's fairly helpful.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.800
Tell me where he is

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.100
Why do I have to tell you that? It seems like you're
not even his colleague.

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.400
Then I'll make you tell me!

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.500
Sakura-chan!

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.700
Give it a rest. You're no match for me.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.300
Still, in order to get out of this
world, Madara must be defeated!

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.600
There is no option
but I have to do it!

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.260
A real hero, who saved everybody...
 the world and the

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:03.500
village at the risk of their lives!
I cannot forget that!

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.700
Sakura!

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:16.700
Hurry up and run away, Menma! I will never
forgive you if you die before us!

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.700
Mom!

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.600
I can sense an ominous energy from you.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.800
The Yellow Flash?

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.000
I planted my jutsu when I was collecting the scroll.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:51.000
I will get back the Red Moon Scroll and carry it if
need be.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.400
I won't hand over Sense's memento!

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.600
If that's so, then I'll make you to offer it to me.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.500
Sakura-chan!

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.500
By exchanging it for this girl's life.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.600
As if I'd let you!?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.300
I will leave you a present.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.100
What is that?

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.100
It's big trouble. A ball of chakra.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.300
Great Spiraling Ring!

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.100
Menma?! Menma?!

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.300
Menma...

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:16.950
This is tremendous!

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:23.600
Sakura-chan?!

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.760
The Red Moon Scroll is still
in our hand. We better

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.100
prepare ourselves and
wait for the opportunity.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:33.560
What the heck are you talking about?!
This isn't

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.399
the time to wait by relaxing!
We have to go save her!

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.700
It would be too hard right now, Menma!
He's hard to deal with in our

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:45.560
current condition. We can't risk
our lives just to save Sakura.

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:48.800
How could you?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.800
We're human before being a ninja.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:56.800
But:..

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.500
What if you get hurt?!

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.100
As your parent, we're worried
bout you, Menma.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.100
I believe in you!

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.100
I'm counting on you to protect the village,
Naruto!

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.800
A real hero, who saved everybody...
 the world and the

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.700
village at the risk of their lives!
I cannot forget that!

01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:22.300
I'll be right back!

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:30.300
If I don't finish him here right now, he'll become a
bigger threat than the Nine-Tails.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.200
There's no hope for you left!

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.899
Rasengan!

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.800
Kushina, I'm sorry!

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.500
It's alright. I can still fight, Minato.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:22.300
Thank you for everything you have
done for me so far. Don't make

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:31.900
that face, Minato. I'm really happy.
Because I'm adored by you!

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:41.100
If I was able to live, I think we three would live
happily.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.500
I get so excited just imagining that picture.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.800
I will seal the Nine-Tails into Naruto together with
your remaining chakra.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:21.800
In our child? I don't want to give a such heavy
burden to our adorable baby!

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:28.100
For the balance of bijuu,
for the nation, for me!

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.000
I don't Naruto to be sacrificed for that

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:37.500
It's not only Naruto! Why do you have to be sacrificed as well?!

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:47.000
Because we're a family of ninjas.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.200
We won't be able to meet him for a while. Let's say
the words we want to tell him.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:10.800
Naruto, don't be picky with food
and eat lots to grow up!

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:16.400
Also, make friends. You don't
have to make too many.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:22.000
I's alright to have only few
who you can really trust.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.400
And this is related to the
three taboos of ninja...

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.200
You need to be careful
with Jiraiya Sensei.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:39.900
Naruto, you will have a lot of hard and painful
things in the future.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:49.900
Find a deam, and in order to reach
the dream, be confident!

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:01.900
There are so many more things I want 
 to do teach you. I want to be

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:07.060
next to you. I want to stay
with you longer. I love you!

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.950
I have to go.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.500
You don't have to go!

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:33.900
There no need to be a hero!

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:37.100
Actually, I'm not a person from this world!

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:43.450
Sorry for lying, but my name
 isn't Menma!

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.500
Why are you using ridiculous talk all of a sudden?

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:54.800
My real dad was the Forth Hokage. And my mom
was a jinchuriki of the Nine-Tails.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:14:04.310
In order to save the village.
And in order to save me.

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:06.600
risked their lives, and died!

01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:15.250
Menma!, do us a favor! Please don't go!

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.800
I said I have to go.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.650
Menma...

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.350
Because I'm the heroes child
that's why!

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.600
This place is...

01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:08.800
Another reality that is created
with Limited Tsukuyomi. And

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:12.400
this place is what was called,
 The Shouren Caves!

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.600
This is where the Forth Hokage and Jiraiya trained.

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:24.450
Well, it seems somebody else used it as his safe
house in this world.

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:27.200
What on Earth is your purpose?

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:29.800
You'll get to know soon.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Thank me because you will never be able to see
these kind of things happening ever again.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.550
I finally found you! Madara!

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:37.800
Naruto!

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:44.400
I will go back to the original world after
I'll defeat you!

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.400
I won't be your opponent.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.950
You better give me back the Red Moon Scroll now!

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:03.700
I don't want to! I will consider that if you release
Sakura first!

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.100
If so, I have to take it by killing you.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.850
I was going to fight with you anyway!

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.600
I can sense the ominous
feeling from you. I

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.700
I can't let you go, now!

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.000
Because of  that vicious intent!

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.300
What?!

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:26.650
What is this this feeling?

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:31.800
That again...

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.100
Damn it!

01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:40.180
What's wrong with me now?

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:48.750
Your existence and your chakra are really getting
on my nerves!

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.100
What the heck, it feels like the inside of
 my stomach is jolting...

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.900
That's way, I'd better handle you quickly.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.100
Koen Subaku!
(Zodiac Summoning!)

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:09.160
Golden Shake, Black Tortoise, Azure
Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:20.100
Turn every bone to dust!

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:23.200
This way, they're too many to deal with!

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.700
The enemies just keep coming.

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.100
Stop that.

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:45.500
We came here due to an order by the Hokage.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.700
What...?

01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:52.500
She asked us to support you so that you can deal
with the masked man. Hmm.

01:17:53.170 --> 01:17:55.800
Is that Akatsuki, the group of mercenaries?

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.800
It seems fun to eat the Grim Reaper's chakra.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.250
That is so awesome! The Akatsuki are allies!

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.400
Don't get cocky, now!

01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:53.500
I see. Is this also a twist of this world?

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.800
The Hokage hired, the Akatsuki!

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:00.000
Uchiha Itachi?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.700
That appearance! It doesn't look like physical attacks 
will have any effect on you!

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.200
Still, that doesn't mean there are aren't
 other options!

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:14.700
You can fire the flame if you intend to?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.400
As usual, you're still a bothersome guy!

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:22.550
Please take care of Sakura!

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:49.700
It's lovely to see the flickering vermilion flame on
him.

01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:57.800
There's nothing more beautiful 
than an explosion.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.500
Is that his real identity?

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.000
What...

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:38.550
I see. This place is a training ground.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.300
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!

01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:24.850
You're trying to win by adding to your numbers?
How pathetic.

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.150
You think so?

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:30.800
It's gone far enough!

01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:40.000
You bastard!

01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:06.750
Who are you?

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.350
You're don't know when to give up!

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.400
Naruto!

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.600
This guy, I didn't get him even with 
my Rasen Sriken!

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:50.500
Isn't the inside of your stomach jolting?

01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:56.820
How obtuse you are. It seems
like the thing that is

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.750
in your stomach has been
anxious since a while ago.

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:01.200
Inside my stomach?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.500
How do you...!

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:07.200
I guess that could be the Nine-Tails or something.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.100
Seriously, I couldn't even imagine it could be that!

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:42.400
I didn't though there could be another guy 
who is exactly the same!

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.000
That's why I can't take it

01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:51.850
If you keep existing, you're life will be just a bother  !

01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:58.800
I will erase your existence for sure!

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.600
Die!!!

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.150
What the heck is this? What happened?

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.800
He has the same face as Naruto.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.600
Is he theJinchuriki of this world?!

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:24.700
Kyubi is by far from all Bijuu,the one with the biggest
mass of hate!

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.150
If the two mases of hatred ever meat, a live threatening
battle,will naturally start!

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Now! Who will win?!

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.300
His target is me! Everyone get away from here!

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.800
Naruto!

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:48.600
There was no contract to fight against the Nine-
Tails. We didn't get paid for that.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.600
No way!

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.000
You can't go anywhere with that huge body!

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:33.300
Great Rasengan Barrage!

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.000
Damn it!

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.200
Be quiet! I'm going to
counterattack from now on! I'm

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.400
going to attack the enemy
with Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.800
Are you an idiot?!

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:07.700
Putting it short, the opponent is the same
 as I ,the Nine-Tails

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:16.200
How are you going to fight with only a tiny part of
my chakra?

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.700
You don't ever change, Naruto!

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
From here on, I take care of it!

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.400
You think I'll be deceived
by that kind of tactic? Your

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:35.500
motive is obvious. I have no
intention of giving you my body.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.900
Huh... I don't like you, kid.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:48.600
But beggars can't be choosers. I hate Madara
more than you do.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.900
I would possibly be locked within this world if
you're dead.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.300
If that's what he's intending to do, I don't have any
desire to conform!

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.900
I will lend you my power specially this time.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.500
The enemy of my enemy is an ally?

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:19.350
Alright! But it's the only time! We will fight
together just this once!

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.100
What's happening?

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.500
Isn't this artistic?

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.500
The land will be all twisted and changed.

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.100
Naruto...

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.700
We're the ones who will be the winners!

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.800
How dare you, you fake!

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.100
He does everything he wants with the part of the
chakra.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.500
Give up right now!

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.200
Die!!!

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:11.800
As if I'd let that happen!

01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:02.000
I was expecting this. Of course you are the
winner.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:14.900
However, this fight was beyond my expectations.I never 
 thought youhad such a strong connection with Kyubi!

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.850
Now, it will be over if you get defeated.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:25.100
You don't seem to understand the situation you're
 in, yourself!

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:30.100
Through Nine-Tails and Nine-Tails resonance...

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:38.600
and through dealing with fights you wouldn't be
able to encounter inthe real world.

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:42.200
Your seal has weaken

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.800
Yes, just like that one time.

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.000
I'm undone! Run away, Naruto!

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.150
What? What's going on?!

01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:55.000
So there was still a way like this?

01:32:56.250 --> 01:32:57.700
Eyes Techniques! Naruto!

01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:59.800
With the sharingan, I'll get pulled 
out of your

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:02.800
body like Kushina suffered
if we don't do anything.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.800
I'll take the Nine-Tais!

01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:11.000
Hey! Never look at his eyes!

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:29.000
Damn it! If we don't do anything...

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.000
A red moon...

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:44.000
I have no choice but to do it. If now is the moment
the prophecy was talking about...

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.700
Forget everything!

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.200
Nine-Tails is...

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.000
mine!

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.000
You've run out of all hopes now.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.000
Naruto, get a hold of yourself!

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.900
I erased his memory. He probably won't be able to
move.

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.800
Don't lay a finger on Naruto!

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.700
Huh...

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:47.800
What am I doing right now?

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.800
Moreover,

01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:00.800
Who am I...?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:02.800
Why...

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:06.200
 I am...

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.000
This jutsu was created by the Forth Hokage.

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.400
That, teach it to me!

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.000
Here!

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:12.000
Naruto!

01:36:13.230 --> 01:36:14.930
You woke back up.

01:36:15.230 --> 01:36:18.200
I can't forget that even if I'm dead.
What my

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:22.700
sensei gave me was this
rasengan and my name.

01:36:23.230 --> 01:36:25.400
The book my teacher wrote was A Tale
of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi!

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.200
The one those two heroes in that book!
chose was...

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.800
me!

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.150
Give me the Nine-Tails and die in this world!

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.100
I'm not Menma!

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.400
My name is Naruto!!!

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.100
Naruto!

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:07.000
It has been 16 years since I tasted this jutsu!

01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:11.530
Madara. You still...!

01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:13.530
But, this time...

01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:24.200
Minato! Kushina!

01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.000
You two,why...

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.100
It's because of Minato's dagger!

01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:42.630
Even if you say you're not our Menma. Still, you
don't feel like a stranger.

01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:45.630
Is this a relationship too?

01:37:46.930 --> 01:37:47.800
Well, fine.

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.000
 I will let you keep the Nine-Tails
 for now...

01:37:58.930 --> 01:38:00.630
That man is?

01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:04.630
He's the instigator.

01:38:05.530 --> 01:38:09.800
He threw us into this world. That's why these
strange things have happened!

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.000
Menma!

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.600
Then...

01:38:41.530 --> 01:38:43.230
Naruto, this is...

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.500
You're returning to the place you came from.

01:38:49.630 --> 01:38:51.330
This is a farewell.

01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:58.330
I really thank you for coming here to save me!

01:38:58.630 --> 01:39:04.200
And even if it was for only a short period of time. I really
am grateful to you two!

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:10.100
It was the very first time I got to spend time with
my family.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.800
Thank you for being hard on me!

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:25.300
Thank you for sincerely worrying about me,
scolding me, and living healthily, really.

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:26.600
Thank you!

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.000
This place is!?

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:28.150
Naruto. Your cloth is...

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.700
We came back to our world safely.

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.800
That was close!

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:59.300
A bit longer and we would have got the Nine-Tails!

01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:14.730
I didn't know that stupid prophecy would prove to
be right.

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.000
Madara, that jerk. I never thought he would appear
in the middle of the village.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.900
Based on their description, it could have been a
space-time jutsu.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.400
As always he's a mysterious guy!

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.600
Anyways it's a mercy that you guys are safe.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:52.000
However, it's natural for the village to fall into
confusion.

01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:57.300
In any case, it's best to let them be themselves,
typically.

01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:01.800
By the way, I'm talking about the jounin letters of
 recommendation.

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.300
Of course! Respectfully declined!

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:11.100
After all, the way everyone is normally is the best!

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.900
I know. That helps me relax.

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.870
Sakura!!!!!!

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.400
Dad?

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.200
Sakura!

01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.800
We found her, found her!

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.400
We thought you became a missing child as you
didn't come back as last time!

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:31.200
Oh, my god! Just joking!

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:35.500
It's good, now!

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.800
What's with this girl, it wasn't that long since 
we last saw her!?

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.400
But--That's...

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.600
I'm sorry for all the things I said!

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:59.200
Well, your mother scolds you because she's 
worried about you.

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.500
It's alright!

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
U hum...

01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:13.700
By the way, Sakura! Let's have a real date next
time!

01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:21.070
What are you talking about? I just had a really
long date with you!

01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:22.070
Eh--

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:23.500
No way!

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.070
You call that a date?!?!

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:37.400
Somebody once asked me what a ninja is.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:04.300
My sensei told me that a ninja is one who endures.

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.700
Where were you?

01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:23.500
I searched for you everywhere!

01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:26.300
Iruka Sensei!

01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:28.870
Why are you here?

01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:34.870
Ummm...uh, well, I think I was too harsh on you.

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:38.500
Well...I though you'll want to eat this

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.870
What's wrong?

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.000
Nothing.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.270
Welcome home, Naruto.

01:45:09.570 --> 01:45:11.000
I'm home.

01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:23.000
Alright! I'll be back!

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.300
My name is ...

01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:37.800
Uzumaki Naruto!

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.300
 Ninja!
