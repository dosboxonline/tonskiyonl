Villy and I will head over there,
stake the place out.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.047
If you get compromised,
we'll head in, back you up.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.007
I'll be surrounded by trained killers.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.051
So, I just leave you in there
to get killed?

41:51.134 --> 41:53.762
I don't care what his plans are for me.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.513
I have plans for him.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.057
Negative.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.017
He got past me in Portland and Virginia.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.061
I get near him, it's not happening again.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.730
What, so you kill him
and try to shoot your way out?

42:03.813 --> 42:06.399
He could recognize me,
and I might not have a choice.

42:06.483 --> 42:08.818
And he might have no idea
who the fuck you are.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.403
He had amnesia, remember?

42:10.487 --> 42:11.947
Maybe he did.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.406
Maybe he faked it.

42:13.490 --> 42:15.784
Reacher, it's suicide. And homicide.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.953
You kill Quinn,
then you're killing Teresa too,

42:18.036 --> 42:20.956
'cause for all we know, Quinn's
the only person who knows where she is.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.541
-Someone on his crew will know.
-Even if someone in his crew

42:23.625 --> 42:25.752
has her location, they'll likely kill her

42:25.835 --> 42:29.130
after they find out
there's a third infiltrator in the mix.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.299
They'll cut their losses,
clean up their mess and move on.

42:31.383 --> 42:32.550
Duffy.

42:32.634 --> 42:34.636
She's already dead.

42:34.719 --> 42:35.971
Fuck you.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.264
They found out the maid was undercover,

42:37.347 --> 42:38.515
and she was dead within minutes.

42:38.598 --> 42:40.767
There's no way they haven't already
started cleaning up their mess.

42:41.768 --> 42:43.103
She's gone.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.565
You there?

42:48.775 --> 42:50.652
Duffy, I got to go.

42:50.735 --> 42:52.362
I'll leave my phone on.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.288
Shit.

43:12.007 --> 43:14.551
You get called in like this a lot?

43:14.634 --> 43:16.261
No.

43:16.344 --> 43:19.472
McCabe normally comes to my house
and walks in and out like it's his.

43:19.556 --> 43:21.975
You think we're gonna
walk in and out today?

43:23.435 --> 43:25.270
Or just in?

43:28.148 --> 43:29.524
