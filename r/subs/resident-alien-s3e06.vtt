00:01.479 --> 00:03.394
<i>Previously on
"Resident Alien"...</i>

00:03.394 --> 00:04.482
<i>Harry can't date that bird.</i>

00:04.482 --> 00:05.875
He should be saving the Earth.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.311
<i>The portal is fixed, yeah?</i>

00:07.311 --> 00:09.139
We are moving
to her home planet.

00:09.139 --> 00:11.489
Some people find
chips in their skin

00:11.489 --> 00:13.665
<i>that aliens use
as a tracking device.</i>

00:15.493 --> 00:16.625
What do we got here, Deputy?

00:16.625 --> 00:17.930
Someone found it
near the bus stop.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.497
I'll go through it
and see who it belongs to.

00:19.497 --> 00:22.283
You will never know
a love like Heather and I.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.024
<i>We do not keep secrets
from one another</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:25.373
<i>like humans do.</i>

00:25.373 --> 00:28.115
You are gonna help us
get Harry's alien DNA.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.246
You will leave the planet,

00:29.246 --> 00:31.031
and you will never
see him again.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.100
What the hell is that?

01:41.449 --> 01:43.277
<i>After discovering
the Greys' plan</i>

01:43.277 --> 01:44.756
<i>to change
the Earth's atmosphere,</i>

01:44.756 --> 01:47.107
<i>I have devised
a plan of my own.</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:50.588
<i>I am building a bomb that can
destroy the Greys' spaceship.</i>

01:50.588 --> 01:52.721
<i>And then their stupid,
beautiful hybrids</i>

01:52.721 --> 01:54.766
<i>will be stuck here
and have to get jobs</i>

01:54.766 --> 01:57.508
<i>as personal trainers
and sideline reporters.</i>

01:59.031 --> 02:00.772
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

02:00.772 --> 02:03.471
<i>Something is wrong.</i>

02:05.168 --> 02:07.997
<i>My blood sugar is
dangerously low.</i>

02:07.997 --> 02:11.131
<i>Once the general has the bomb,
she can finish the mission,</i>

02:11.131 --> 02:13.176
<i>and I can embark
on my new one--</i>

02:13.176 --> 02:14.743
<i>leaving the planet
and spending</i>

02:14.743 --> 02:16.701
<i>the rest of my life
with Heather.</i>

02:20.314 --> 02:23.839
Good morning, my beautiful
bird of paradise.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.145
Mm.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.582
Can I make you
a nice breakfast, hmm?

02:27.582 --> 02:31.194
I have a bowl
of worms and insects.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.414
Or there is also still one

02:33.414 --> 02:34.850
aquatic invertebrate
in the fridge.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.156
Oh, that's OK.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.592
I'm--I'm not really hungry.

02:37.592 --> 02:38.506
OK.

02:38.506 --> 02:43.728
Well, I could, uh, chew it up.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.776
Regurgitate it
back in your mouth.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.821
That's really sweet,
but no, thanks.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.650
I think that I--
I didn't really sleep well.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.783
Your human bed is not
as comfortable as the nest

02:54.783 --> 02:55.958
you made me at the hotel.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.742
Then I will make you
a new nest today.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.223
I will go into town,
and I will gather twigs

03:00.223 --> 03:02.573
and string and some hair.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.314
No, Harry, you've already
done too much.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.708
I want to do something for you.

03:06.708 --> 03:07.926
A wing job?

03:07.926 --> 03:10.102
Something even better.

03:10.102 --> 03:12.714
First, I need you to change.

03:18.241 --> 03:21.853
Your gills definitely
needed a cleaning.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.507
There's more
where that came from.

03:27.685 --> 03:28.904
You like this?

03:28.904 --> 03:30.819
Yes, I do.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.516
Oh, it is so nice
to find someone

03:32.516 --> 03:35.345
you can be yourself with.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.695
Just leave everything
out in the open.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.133
No secrets.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.048
Mm-hmm.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.572
Yeah.

03:44.572 --> 03:48.140
My love,
your head is bobbing.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.403
Oh.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.926
Is there something
on your mind?

03:50.926 --> 03:52.014
Weird.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.233
Uh, no.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
Nothing at all.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.278
Definitely nothing to hide.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.888
That's for sure.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.238
You can go harder.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.892
I like the pain.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.633
Oh.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.374
We might need a safe word.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.783
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.611
What are you doing out here?

04:23.611 --> 04:25.395
I worked late, so...

04:25.395 --> 04:28.137
I got tired on my way home,
pulled over.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.444
My house isn't
on your way home.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.923
You got me.

04:31.923 --> 04:36.101
I just came by to make sure
you're doing OK.

04:36.101 --> 04:38.582
And you slept out here?

04:38.582 --> 04:41.803
I mean, how did you even
use the bathroom?

04:41.803 --> 04:43.674
Wait.

04:43.674 --> 04:47.287
Is this about the alien stuff
that you said the other night?

04:47.287 --> 04:50.290
Aliens?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.595
That's crazy.

04:51.595 --> 04:54.032
No, I just--
checking up on you.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.339
If that keeps aliens away,
then great.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.428
I was not abducted by aliens,

04:58.428 --> 05:00.909
so you need to go home
before Kate comes out

05:00.909 --> 05:02.780
and starts asking questions.
- Fine.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.609
Hey, would you toss
my water bottle for me?

05:06.393 --> 05:07.350
Did you piss in it?

05:07.350 --> 05:08.830
You know I did.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.832
Pretty full.
Smells like pee-pee.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.399
Would you throw it out,
yes or no?

05:12.399 --> 05:13.443
- No.
- Give it a toss.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.575
It's full of urine.

05:16.751 --> 05:17.491
Really?

05:17.491 --> 05:19.144
It's just pee.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.146
Love ya.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.853
Huh. Lovely.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.376
There you are.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.639
Tell me you did not spend
another night

05:35.639 --> 05:37.162
guarding Ben and Kate's house.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.207
Yeah, but he caught me,

05:38.207 --> 05:39.817
so can't do that again.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.384
Tonight I'll have to bring binoculars

05:41.384 --> 05:43.473
and park up the street,
watch from there.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.345
What's the plan here?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.477
Let's say you witness
an abduction.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.436
How exactly are you
gonna stop it?

05:49.436 --> 05:51.002
Baseball bat.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.830
I've seen pictures of Greys
on the internet.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.310
Their long necks,
their heads are

05:54.310 --> 05:56.573
just right in my strike zone.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.662
Not to complain,
but would it kill Jay

05:58.662 --> 06:00.360
to wash a dish once in a while?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.491
That sounds like complaining.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.623
I know.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.364
She's your daughter,
and that actually

06:04.364 --> 06:05.495
explains why she doesn't clean.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.367
But her stuff is everywhere.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.370
Pullout couch, always open.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.894
Oh, my raspberry yogurt's
gone again.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.069
Big surprise.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.027
- You finished that yesterday.
- Yeah.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.160
Because I knew if I didn't,
Jay would eat it.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.291
Fine.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.032
I'll buy you more yogurt
and clean.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.077
Happy?

06:23.078 --> 06:24.296
No.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.907
Jay should be doing that.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.431
Look, things are really good
between Jay and I right now,

06:28.431 --> 06:30.128
and I don't want
to rock the boat.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.000
Besides, we have
bigger things to worry about,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.046
like how to keep Harry
from leaving with Heather.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.266
Jay seems like
the least of our--

06:42.097 --> 06:43.925
Sup, fam?

06:57.242 --> 06:59.462
You're out of milk, FYI.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.079
Jay's the least of our--
you were saying?

07:08.079 --> 07:10.386
Leave me alone.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.173
Nothing like
a good gill excavation

07:15.173 --> 07:17.567
to make you feel new again.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.613
What can I do to thank you?

07:19.613 --> 07:21.484
You don't need to thank me.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.703
I don't deserve it.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.835
You deserve everything.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.359
That is why
I will finish this bomb,

07:27.359 --> 07:32.408
so that we can leave
and we can never look back.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.106
I cannot wait to see
your planet.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.066
Will your friends accept

07:38.066 --> 07:41.373
that you are dating
an un-winged alien?

07:41.373 --> 07:43.114
Let's not talk
about the future.

07:44.594 --> 07:47.031
Let's just--let's just talk
about the present

07:47.031 --> 07:49.425
because it's so special.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.254
You know, I think that's
why they call it the present,

07:52.254 --> 07:53.734
'cause it's a present.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.127
That reminds me,
I wrote you a--a new poem.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.302
You did?

07:57.302 --> 07:58.521
I love your poems.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.741
But don't read it to me.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.525
Stop right there
and do not read it,

08:02.525 --> 08:04.962
because I'm gonna
take this out,

08:04.962 --> 08:08.662
and if I don't come right back,

08:08.662 --> 08:10.925
that's just because
I ran out to get cigarettes.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.188
But you do not even smoke.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.801
I love that you try new things.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.721
<i>This must be
what true love is like.</i>

08:24.721 --> 08:26.810
<i>When your lover leaves,</i>

08:26.810 --> 08:29.334
<i>you feel like
you will never see them again.</i>

08:30.945 --> 08:34.470
<i>And the sound of her tires
peeling out of my driveway,</i>

08:34.470 --> 08:37.691
<i>I can tell she is in a hurry
to come back to me.</i>

08:45.568 --> 08:47.048
Here you go, Debra.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.092
Morning, Sheriff.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.051
Hey, Deputy.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.575
Hey, do you ever
get the feeling like--

08:52.575 --> 08:54.751
like you're being followed?

08:54.751 --> 08:57.014
Right now comes to mind.

08:57.014 --> 08:59.408
Last night,
I felt someone following me.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.062
So this morning,
I changed up my route,

09:01.062 --> 09:03.891
but I think that son of a bitch
Joseph is still on my tail.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.501
You know what this means,
don't you?

09:05.501 --> 09:07.590
We're on the right track
with our investigation.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.679
Our investigation? No.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.290
I told you, when I get
involved, people get hurt.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.291
I'm done.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.249
What?

09:14.249 --> 09:15.511
I thought you just needed time.

09:15.511 --> 09:16.773
I don't need time.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.470
I need distance.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.821
Taking time helps you see
things more clearly, Deputy.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.388
Hey, you know, Cletus peed
in my bed once, right?

09:23.388 --> 09:25.303
Now, I got mad,
but did I get rid of him?

09:25.303 --> 09:26.217
No.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.610
I took some time to reflect

09:27.610 --> 09:28.959
and find the right move.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.613
So then I went and peed
in his little doggy bed,

09:30.613 --> 09:32.310
and I said to him,
"Now, how do you like it now?"

09:32.310 --> 09:33.747
That's how he learns.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.444
They pee on you,
you pee on them.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.141
I'm not gonna
rub his nose in it.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.447
That'd just be cruel.

09:38.447 --> 09:41.058
Not more cruel than me
listening to this story.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.407
Hey.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.932
Uh, I need to talk to you guys
about something.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.281
I have had some complaints

09:46.281 --> 09:47.587
regarding
the Sheriff's Department.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.153
I told you
it was a terrible idea

09:49.153 --> 09:50.851
to put up that suggestion box.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.723
Yes, I got that from the note
you put in the suggestion box

09:53.723 --> 09:56.465
telling me to take down
the suggestion box.

09:56.465 --> 09:59.076
It seems certain constituents

09:59.076 --> 10:01.209
aren't happy
about their taxpayer dollars

10:01.209 --> 10:05.082
being wasted investigating
alien-related matters.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.301
Taxpayers shouldn't
have a say

10:06.301 --> 10:07.781
in how their tax dollars
are spent.

10:07.781 --> 10:09.217
That's anarchy.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.740
Well, some people
call it democracy.

10:10.740 --> 10:11.785
Exactly.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.438
This is a free country.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.310
People can look for aliens
if they want,

10:15.310 --> 10:18.052
or search the forest
for fairies,

10:18.052 --> 10:19.793
even if they only find
a small frog

10:19.793 --> 10:21.751
living in an old shotgun shell.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.800
You said certain people
are lodging complaints.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.975
I want to know who.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.194
I am not at liberty to say.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.369
Hi, Sheriff.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.067
Nana.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.678
Thank you, Mayor,
for our little talk.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.334
Oh, come on, Liv.

10:39.334 --> 10:42.293
How do you expect people
to take you seriously

10:42.293 --> 10:45.209
with that crease
in your britches?

10:46.776 --> 10:48.691
Ugh.

10:48.691 --> 10:49.866
She's right.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.651
I do have a crease.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.740
How did she see that?

10:53.740 --> 10:56.133
Sheriff, I'd like to see you
in my office.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.526
Mm.

11:03.358 --> 11:06.666
All right, Sheriff,
have a... seat.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.019
I asked to see you
in my office.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.194
No, you said

11:13.194 --> 11:14.935
you'd like to see me
in your office.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.240
And I don't blame you.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.764
Hell, I'm a statue
of masculinity.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.722
If I was in your office,
you'd probably walk in

11:19.722 --> 11:23.160
every morning and say, "Damn,
now, that's what I want to be."

11:23.160 --> 11:24.335
If you were a statue
in my office,

11:24.335 --> 11:25.554
I'd hang my jacket on you.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.208
I'd want you to,
because I'd be made

11:27.208 --> 11:28.731
out of metal, and I'd be cold.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.037
See?

11:30.037 --> 11:31.865
Even as a statue man,
I still get what I want.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.170
OK, here's the thing.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.346
You and Liv have been
seen around town

11:35.346 --> 11:38.741
snooping in plain clothes,
investigating something.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.961
Not to mention, you know,
how you practically begged me

11:40.961 --> 11:42.397
for a new deputy,
but now he's gone,

11:42.397 --> 11:43.746
and you haven't even
replaced him?

11:43.746 --> 11:45.139
What is going on?

11:45.139 --> 11:46.401
Why are you being so secretive?

11:46.401 --> 11:47.837
Why are you being
so inquisitive?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.056
Because I have
a right to know.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.666
This is my town.
- Oh, really?

11:50.666 --> 11:52.450
You obviously don't know
how towns work.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.843
You ever see a Western?

11:53.843 --> 11:56.280
It's the sheriff that says,
"You're in my town now,"

11:56.280 --> 11:57.804
not the mayor.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.806
Do you drive a car
that has "mayor" written on it?

11:59.806 --> 12:01.111
Yes, I do.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.373
- You do?
- Yes.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.332
Sometimes when it's dirty,

12:04.332 --> 12:05.768
Max writes "mayor"
in the window,

12:05.768 --> 12:06.900
and that's mayor,

12:06.900 --> 12:11.556
as in "may your...

12:11.556 --> 12:14.516
"town, if it is in trouble,

12:14.516 --> 12:16.431
I will be the one to fix it."

12:16.431 --> 12:19.564
You may have the word "sheriff"
on your car door,

12:19.564 --> 12:21.479
but the name "Hawthorne"
is printed

12:21.479 --> 12:22.698
on the soul of this town.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.265
Right.
Like that poison creek.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.266
Forget about the creek.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.484
That's being renamed.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.443
I don't know why
you're being like this.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.923
You know, we used to be
like partners.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.228
We were never partners.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.535
We operate under
a split form of government,

12:33.535 --> 12:35.711
like Madagascar or East Timor,

12:35.711 --> 12:38.758
with two leaders
sharing separate powers, OK?

12:38.758 --> 12:42.196
Now, if you don't mind,
I got work to do.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.807
<i>Humans thrive on forming
connections to each other.</i>

12:44.807 --> 12:47.027
<i>But when that connection
is broken,</i>

12:47.027 --> 12:49.290
<i>it makes them feel untethered.</i>

12:49.290 --> 12:52.206
<i>They do not like that.</i>

12:52.206 --> 12:54.599
<i>That is how I am
starting to feel.</i>

12:54.599 --> 12:56.166
<i>Heather has been gone
for two hours,</i>

12:56.166 --> 12:58.908
<i>and all I can think of is,
what if she is hurt?</i>

12:58.908 --> 13:02.390
<i>What if she has been plucked
and stuffed into a pillow</i>

13:02.390 --> 13:04.174
<i>or cozy lightweight jacket?</i>

13:13.183 --> 13:14.402
Hello.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.404
Oh.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.322
Thank you.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.540
<i>"Harry, if you're

13:25.761 --> 13:26.631
No.

13:26.631 --> 13:27.894

13:27.894 --> 13:29.504

13:29.504 --> 13:31.071

14:36.397 --> 14:37.746
Heather.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.966
We can't keep doing
the notes.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.141
It's not fair to Arlo.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.533
He's freakin' exhausted.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.231
My love, you came back.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.929
No, Harry, it's over.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.191
What?

14:48.191 --> 14:49.410
But why?

14:49.410 --> 14:52.892
Because I don't love you.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.849
I never did.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.111
No.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.942
I don't believe you. Ah! Ow.

14:59.942 --> 15:03.032
Why? Ow.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.773
I think my heart is stopping.

15:04.773 --> 15:05.992
It's not.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.341
Hearts are the only thing
in the universe

15:07.341 --> 15:09.865
that work even after
they break.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.041
It's the thing that sucks
about hearts.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.521
How do you know that?

15:13.521 --> 15:16.089
Is it because your heart
is breaking too?

15:16.089 --> 15:17.742
No.

15:17.742 --> 15:18.787
My heart's fine.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.310
Feels great.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.921
Well, you cannot
take our love.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.052
It is not just yours.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.446
It is also mine.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.100
I'm sorry, I have to go.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.362
No, wait, I--

15:28.362 --> 15:31.321
I have a--a poem to read you.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.236
You have to listen.

15:35.456 --> 15:38.938
It is titled
"Forever Together."

15:40.678 --> 15:42.898
"Boy, I just
can't stop smiling."

15:42.898 --> 15:44.900
No, I can't do this.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.554
I cannot do this.

15:47.859 --> 15:48.860
Good--

15:53.822 --> 15:54.997
Good what?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.825
"Good"?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.698
"Goodness, I love you."

16:00.698 --> 16:02.831
"Good thing I was joking."

16:02.831 --> 16:04.137
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

16:05.094 --> 16:06.095
Huh?

16:12.058 --> 16:13.407
"Bye."

16:17.106 --> 16:19.021
"Goodbye."

16:22.242 --> 16:24.157
Why?

16:27.899 --> 16:35.124
Why?

17:01.542 --> 17:02.804
Got you, son of a bitch.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.199
Wait, you're not Joseph.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.374
I--I'm Troy.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.375
Troy?

17:08.375 --> 17:09.506
Whoa.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.942
Are you Lena's son?

17:10.942 --> 17:12.205
I was just curious.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.945
I wanted to see the guy
my mom was dating.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.164
Come on, son.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.078
You can't be
following people around

17:16.078 --> 17:17.210
in the dark, all right?

17:17.210 --> 17:18.820
It's dangerous.
And you can relax.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.083
We're not dating.
We're just colleagues.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.824
She doesn't talk about
her other colleagues

17:22.824 --> 17:23.868
the way she talks about you.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.740
She talks about me?

17:25.740 --> 17:27.307
I overheard her
telling my Aunt Naya

17:27.307 --> 17:28.699
you don't like her
paying for stuff?

17:28.699 --> 17:29.874
I don't get it.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.050
What's wrong with her paying?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.052
Look, I appreciate
that you're here

17:33.052 --> 17:34.140
to protect your mom, all right?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.315
But this is grown man stuff.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.968
You wouldn't understand.
It's complicated.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.187
No, it's not.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.102
From now on,
you stay away from her.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.712
OK, well, she's already
staying away from me.

17:41.712 --> 17:42.974
Why wouldn't she?

17:42.974 --> 17:44.889
You made her cry.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.675
What kind of a man are you?

17:57.163 --> 17:58.120
Harry?

17:59.382 --> 18:02.124
I got a text saying
you want to die,

18:02.124 --> 18:04.126
followed by an emoji
of a skull,

18:04.126 --> 18:06.128
then a noose, then a gun.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.739
Yeah.
And then a knife and a casket.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.785
Then for some reason, a church?

18:10.785 --> 18:12.874
That was a mistake.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.398
It was supposed to be a sword.

18:16.747 --> 18:19.315
What's going on?

18:19.315 --> 18:20.577
Heather left me.

18:20.577 --> 18:21.839
Yes.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.754
Yes, she did.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.017
And that is awful.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.367
She's gone.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.411
It's over.

18:28.411 --> 18:29.804
Now my life is over.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.023
Oh, I'm so sorry, Harry.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.721
Do not lie.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.070
You're happy.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.465
The red-haired one
is trying not to smile.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.901
It seems like you know
my name by now.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.424
OK.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.122
Look, we did try
to break you guys up,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.775
but it didn't work.
- Right.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.429
So maybe it's just you.

18:48.605 --> 18:49.606
Is that helping?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.042
I...

18:51.042 --> 18:52.957
You're wrong.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.959
Heather loved me.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.222
I loved her.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.137
I don't know what happened.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.444
Sometimes there is
no explanation.

19:01.444 --> 19:02.445
Oh.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.186
Hey.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.971
You just need to get your mind
off her, you know.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.104
Stay busy.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.412
Focus on
your little project here.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.805
Huh, what is it?

19:14.805 --> 19:18.200
Some kind of alien bird feeder?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.810
- It's a bomb.
- A bomb, you say.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.116
What's that now?

19:21.116 --> 19:23.205
I built it
for the general to use

19:23.205 --> 19:26.643
on the Greys
after I left with Heather.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.167
OK.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.256
Well, saving the Earth,
that's something to live for.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.041
I don't care about the Earth.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.390
This place sucks.

19:34.390 --> 19:35.652
I hate it here!

19:35.652 --> 19:36.871
Uh!

19:38.002 --> 19:40.135
Hey, Greys!

19:40.135 --> 19:41.963
Come and take this Earth!

19:41.963 --> 19:42.964
I don't want it!

19:42.964 --> 19:44.618
You can have it!

19:44.618 --> 19:47.316
Hey, take this stupid plant!

19:47.316 --> 19:48.317
I don't want it!

19:48.317 --> 19:49.188
You can have it!

19:49.188 --> 19:51.233
Take this stupid chair!

19:51.233 --> 19:52.147
Huh?

19:52.147 --> 19:53.975
I don't care anymore!

19:53.975 --> 19:55.803
- OK.
- Take me!

19:55.803 --> 19:57.500
I want to die!

19:57.500 --> 20:00.808
OK, will you come back
in here, please?

20:00.808 --> 20:02.940
Maybe you'll feel better
if you eat something.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.203
We got you a pizza.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.292
I do not care
about your pizza.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.424
I hate the Earth,
and I hate you.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.904
Whoa!

20:09.904 --> 20:12.341
That is not how I taught you
to behave.

20:13.821 --> 20:16.345
Asta worked hard to pay
for that pizza, young man.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.868
You will get your butt
out here and eat it.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.044
I don't care, and I hate you!

20:20.044 --> 20:21.307
I hate you more!

20:23.265 --> 20:24.832
You know,
for the first time in my life,

20:24.832 --> 20:26.703
I feel like I have
what it takes to be a mother.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.625
I finally met Lena's son.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.887
He's been tailing me.

20:36.887 --> 20:39.890
He wanted to see
who his mom was dating.

20:42.632 --> 20:43.677
Wanna talk about it?

20:43.677 --> 20:45.287
Nah.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.593
There's nothing to talk about.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.074
She said we're colleagues,
but then I find out

20:50.074 --> 20:52.642
she's been crying
over the breakup.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.601
Seems like you want
to talk about it.

20:54.601 --> 20:55.906
No, no.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.430
This is our quiet time.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.737
Quiet time.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.740
You know,
maybe it's my destiny,

21:03.740 --> 21:06.134
you know, to be alone.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.964
OK.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.618
Let's talk about it.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.057
Her kid's right.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.886
What kind of man
has somebody special

21:18.886 --> 21:21.932
then just--
just pushes her away?

21:21.932 --> 21:25.414
The kind of man
that lost his mom

21:25.414 --> 21:29.113
when he was young
and raised by his father.

21:30.506 --> 21:34.945
You got attached to these
notions of masculinity.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.773
So take it easy on yourself.

21:36.773 --> 21:37.905
It's not your fault.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.301
Now can we fish?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.780
You're the one
who wanted to talk.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.963
He was serious about leaving.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.313
This thing has
all the instructions

21:54.313 --> 21:55.749
on what to do with this bomb.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.099
Well, anything productive
is on hold for a bit.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.144
He just asked
if men can be nuns.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.798
Probably for the best.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.800
I don't know if I want him
handling a bomb right now.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.369
I am so tired of playing
parent to this alien child.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.763
It's enough to do it at home.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.331
Yeah.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.377
What?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.552
Nothing.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.467
You're just not really
doing it at home.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.469
I told you, Jay and I
are in a good place.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.341
I don't want to ruin that.
- Right.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.212
You're afraid to piss off
the teenager who lives with us

22:24.212 --> 22:26.997
and eats my yogurt,
so now I have no yogurt.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.564
I am not afraid.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.696
Yes, you are.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.088
You're afraid
you're gonna lose her.

22:31.088 --> 22:34.091
And you're aiding
and abetting her.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.397
Aiding and abetting?

22:35.397 --> 22:38.008
What, is yogurt-eating
a felony now?

22:38.008 --> 22:40.663
No, it's just,
you're trying to be

22:40.663 --> 22:43.666
her friend instead of just
being a responsible adult.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.495
If I'm so irresponsible,
why do you come running to me

22:46.495 --> 22:47.757
every time you're in trouble?

22:47.757 --> 22:49.672
Because you let me,
which might be

22:49.672 --> 22:51.979
how this whole problem got
started, if I'm being honest.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.284
Oh, oh, OK.

22:53.284 --> 22:54.285
So I've ruined you
because I'm there for you

22:54.285 --> 22:55.504
when you need me?

22:55.504 --> 22:57.419
No, you're there for me
when it suits you,

22:57.419 --> 22:58.855
when it makes you feel
better about yourself,

22:58.855 --> 22:59.856
like Harry said.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.292
Thank you.

23:02.685 --> 23:05.296
Tell me one time
that I was not there for you.

23:05.296 --> 23:07.298
Oh, I don't know,
maybe when you drove me insane

23:07.298 --> 23:08.865
by keeping
a life-altering secret from me

23:08.865 --> 23:09.910
for a year and a half?

23:09.910 --> 23:11.215
Oh, really? This again?

23:11.215 --> 23:12.391
What was I supposed to do,

23:12.391 --> 23:13.827
tell you the new doctor
is an alien?

23:13.827 --> 23:15.263
Yes!

23:15.263 --> 23:17.613
I'm supposed to be
your best friend,

23:17.613 --> 23:18.875
but you couldn't
share that with me.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.486
Why?

23:20.486 --> 23:21.878
I'm not getting into this.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.532
Well, we're in it.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.229
Let's just drop it, please.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.057
I don't want to drop it.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.407
I want to know why.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.104
Because you're
a loose cannon,

23:30.104 --> 23:31.235
and I didn't know
if I could trust you.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.846
Is that what you want to hear?

23:32.846 --> 23:34.151
You are so impulsive,

23:34.151 --> 23:36.284
I just knew that
you would tell someone.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.242
That's bullshit.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.679
You didn't want to tell me
because Harry

23:39.679 --> 23:42.464
dropping down to Earth
was a godsend for you.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.248
Just you.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.902
Secret little baby
you found on your doorstep,

23:45.902 --> 23:47.817
another one for your
menagerie of the needy.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.080
You told Ben that
he was getting abducted

23:50.080 --> 23:51.342
when I told you not to.

23:51.342 --> 23:52.735
You did it anyway
because you don't listen

23:52.735 --> 23:54.084
because you make everything
about yourself.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.346
I do not.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.391
How do I make everything
about myself?

23:56.391 --> 23:57.653
Tell me. I want to know.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.133
A lot of "I's" and "me's"
in that denial.

23:59.133 --> 24:01.570
I told Ben
because real friends

24:01.570 --> 24:03.703
don't keep huge secrets
from each other.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.270
You told Ben
because you feel guilty,

24:06.270 --> 24:08.055
and so you made everything
about you.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.883
OK, fine. Fine.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.188
I make everything about me.

24:11.188 --> 24:12.886
But you make everything
about you

24:12.886 --> 24:16.237
by saying it's not about you
because you're a martyr.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.239
I'd rather be a martyr
than a loose cannon.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.936
Well, that is exactly
what a martyr would say.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.503
- Loose cannon.
- Martyr.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.640
Pretend I'm not here.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.060
Why are you here?

24:57.060 --> 24:59.280
I came to see
how you're doing.

25:00.411 --> 25:01.978
Were you getting dressed?

25:01.978 --> 25:03.284
Undressed?

25:03.284 --> 25:05.852
Or is this just how it is now?

25:05.852 --> 25:08.550
Would you ask a woman that?

25:09.899 --> 25:12.249
Your friend Asta
contacted me.

25:12.249 --> 25:15.731
Said you're a mess
and can't work.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.124
Now, I don't know
the first thing

25:17.124 --> 25:19.909
about how to console
a lovesick alien,

25:19.909 --> 25:23.217
but I heard about
your chicken girlfriend

25:23.217 --> 25:25.219
or whatever she was.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.655
So...

25:36.622 --> 25:39.581
What the hell is that?

25:39.581 --> 25:41.670
The guy said
her name is Patricia.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.672
I thought maybe
she could help you

25:43.672 --> 25:45.587
get over your girlfriend.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.588
No judgment.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.329
Everyone has their thing.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.679
I am offended that you think

25:50.679 --> 25:53.595
you can replace
the love of my life

25:53.595 --> 25:55.641
with just some random bird.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.772
No offense.

25:56.772 --> 25:58.469
This has nothing
to do with you.

25:58.469 --> 25:59.862
You're very attractive.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.211
Do whatever you need.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.691
Just finish that bomb.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.346
And don't fall in love.

26:05.346 --> 26:06.956
She's a rental.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.792
Don't worry, we don't
have to do anything.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.318
We can just talk.

26:23.407 --> 26:26.802
And even though I've never
had a UFO encounter myself,

26:26.802 --> 26:29.370
I'm here
to support my daughter,

26:29.370 --> 26:31.633
because I love her.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.635
I love you too, Mom.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.854
Oh, baby.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.250
OK.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.122
Thank you for sharing, Dorothy.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.864
So this is where
all the crazies meet.

26:44.864 --> 26:48.084
I expected there'd be
more padding on the walls.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.831
- Hi.
- You came.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.877
Yeah.
I was in the neighborhood,

26:57.877 --> 26:59.139
so I figured I might as well.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.532
You're new.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.317
You want to tell us
a little about yourself

27:03.317 --> 27:04.318
and why you're here?

27:04.318 --> 27:05.667
Oh, me? No.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.800
Um, I'm--I'm not here
to participate.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.846
I'm--I'm just here to watch.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.283
We don't get
a lot of watchers here.

27:13.283 --> 27:17.287
Well, I--I haven't
experienced anything.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.159
I mean, I--

27:19.159 --> 27:22.684
I've been seeing this owl
outside my window.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.990
But it's not a big deal.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.688
I mean,
this is Colorado, right?

27:26.688 --> 27:28.690
There are owls.

27:28.690 --> 27:29.778
14 varieties, actually.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.693
I--I looked it up online.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.303
So, you know, no, I--

27:33.303 --> 27:34.696
I think I'm good.

27:40.049 --> 27:42.356
Except, um, I'm not--
I'm not good.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.140
I'm...

27:48.014 --> 27:51.887
I used to like where I live.

27:51.887 --> 27:56.762
But now--I mean,
I love our--our home, but...

27:59.460 --> 28:02.811
But I don't feel safe there.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.031
I mean, I--I even--

28:05.031 --> 28:07.816
I even tried to convince
my husband to sell our house.

28:07.816 --> 28:11.080
But I--I think
it's bigger than that.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.952
Like, I think
I'm not safe anywhere.

28:12.952 --> 28:16.042
And I just feel like
I'm going crazy.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.392
Oh, am I allowed to use
that word in here?

28:18.392 --> 28:20.742
You're not crazy.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.701
I've had a similar experience.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.615
At first, the owls
didn't seem odd,

28:24.615 --> 28:26.922
but then it just
kept happening.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.924
I even put our house up
on the market.

28:28.924 --> 28:31.057
And then one day,
I'm in the shower,

28:31.057 --> 28:33.886
and I find this tiny bump
behind my knee

28:33.886 --> 28:35.409
that I'd never noticed.

28:35.409 --> 28:38.412
So I did some research,
and I realized

28:38.412 --> 28:41.241
it's maybe a chip
they implanted in me,

28:41.241 --> 28:42.982
and that people
all over the world

28:42.982 --> 28:45.288
have been having
similar experiences.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.597
Are you OK?

28:52.382 --> 28:54.471
I don't know.

28:57.518 --> 29:00.129
Does he have any idea
you were taking his DNA?

29:00.129 --> 29:01.348
No.

29:01.348 --> 29:02.610
I feel terrible, though.

29:02.610 --> 29:03.785
I love him.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.569
Oh, that's sweet.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.615
You love your niece?

29:07.615 --> 29:08.790
My knees?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.618
You're gonna break my knees?

29:10.618 --> 29:11.924
Niece.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.969
Your niece, your sister's kid.
- OK.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.492
Well, you could have
just said my sister.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.493
I love her too.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.936
Oh, snap.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.894
Niece and knees,
very different.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.243
How so?

29:27.243 --> 29:32.683
Niece is a little girl
or a city in France.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.381
I don't break knees.

29:34.381 --> 29:36.296
I'm here on the scene,

29:36.296 --> 29:40.126
watching Asta's boyfriend
and Harry's girlfriend

29:40.126 --> 29:42.998
having a rendezvous.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.827
Both of them sound like
my sister's girl child.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.655
You have a niece
called knees?

29:47.655 --> 29:50.049
Yeah. She's my niece.

29:50.049 --> 29:51.877
How are we losing
to you people?

30:00.537 --> 30:03.236
Shift reports
for you to sign.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.846
Everything OK, Deputy?

30:04.846 --> 30:06.979
You got your sad face on.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.197
Really?

30:08.197 --> 30:09.372
I have a sad face?

30:09.372 --> 30:10.547
I'll give you a tip.

30:10.547 --> 30:13.115
Here, put this pencil
in your mouth.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.725
Sideways.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.031
There you go.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.859
You feel your smile muscles
stretching out?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.600
See, when you're sad,
you fool your body

30:19.600 --> 30:22.385
into thinking you're happy,
then you feel happy.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.213
How long does it take?

30:24.213 --> 30:25.519
Uh, seven minutes.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.086
Of course, I'm a pro,
so I did it in three

30:27.086 --> 30:29.262
using that very same pencil.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.918
So tell me, Deputy,
what's got you down?

30:34.658 --> 30:36.486
I went to one
of my meetings today.

30:36.486 --> 30:39.185
And this woman, Linda,
brought her mom.

30:39.185 --> 30:42.841
She just came
to support her daughter.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.974
I never had
that kind of support,

30:45.974 --> 30:47.628
and I probably never will.

30:47.628 --> 30:48.716
Mm.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.065
You know what?
Take a seat, Deputy.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.850
I--I want to tell you
a story about this guy.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.590
Is this guy you?

30:53.590 --> 30:54.765
Uh, doesn't matter.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.593
Anyway, there's
this really handsome guy

30:56.593 --> 30:58.421
that smells really good, right?

30:58.421 --> 31:00.423
And he lost his mother
in his teens.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.077
Now, his father--
- Lewis?

31:02.077 --> 31:03.862
Can I finish telling you
the story about this guy?

31:03.862 --> 31:05.733
- Yeah.
- OK, so his--his father,

31:05.733 --> 31:08.344
he may have pushed
his notions of masculinity

31:08.344 --> 31:10.172
on this guy
a little too hard, right?

31:10.172 --> 31:13.436
And maybe if this guy would
have confronted his issues

31:13.436 --> 31:15.047
earlier in life,
he wouldn't have

31:15.047 --> 31:16.526
let his ego get the best of him

31:16.526 --> 31:18.311
and pushed away
a perfectly good woman.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.269
Is the woman Lena Torres?

31:20.269 --> 31:22.097
Let's call her Meena Flores.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.969
OK, look, my point is,

31:23.969 --> 31:26.362
we're shaped by the people
who raise us.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.974
And the people around you
weren't very supportive.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.759
In fact, they actively
held you down.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.501
Now, you are
the strongest person I know,

31:34.501 --> 31:36.459
except when you're around
your Grandma Patty.

31:36.459 --> 31:37.939
You need to stand up to her.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.810
I can't.

31:39.810 --> 31:43.292
She's mean and gives
deceptively powerful noogies.

31:43.292 --> 31:47.079
Well, what if I told you
I knew a guy who'd go with you

31:47.079 --> 31:50.038
and give you all the support
you've never had?

31:50.038 --> 31:51.083
Is this guy you?

31:51.083 --> 31:52.127
Ha!

31:52.127 --> 31:53.302
You finally figured it out.

31:54.303 --> 31:55.652
<i>♪ Took a vacay from</i>

31:55.652 --> 31:57.089

31:57.089 --> 31:59.874

32:07.751 --> 32:09.579
I'll give you
a lesson sometime.

32:09.579 --> 32:10.667
Been trying
to get ahold of you,

32:10.667 --> 32:12.060
but I see you were busy.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.235
Dude, the snow was awesome.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.715
You should have come with us.

32:14.715 --> 32:17.065
Yeah, it must be nice
to take off work on a whim.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.980
So impulsive, you know?

32:18.980 --> 32:20.373
OK.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.942
So what, you have a problem
with me snowboarding now?

32:23.942 --> 32:25.030
Nope.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.031
Where is Harry?

32:26.031 --> 32:27.162
I don't know.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.337
Last time I saw him,
I was with you.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.338
Well, I went to the cabin,

32:29.338 --> 32:30.339
and he isn't there.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.645
All I found was a giant bird

32:31.645 --> 32:32.994
who isn't Heather.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.474
He definitely has a type.

32:34.474 --> 32:36.780
OK.
Why are you looking for him?

32:36.780 --> 32:39.000
Judy saw Joseph
talking to Heather.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.697
What? Where?

32:40.697 --> 32:42.003
<i>I'm here on the scene,
watching--</i>

32:42.003 --> 32:44.092
Ignore the--
she had a filter on.

32:45.528 --> 32:46.877
I can't hear
what they're saying.

32:46.877 --> 32:48.270
What the hell?

32:48.270 --> 32:50.011
Is the bird a spy
for the Greys?

32:50.011 --> 32:52.013
We have to find Harry
and tell him.

32:52.013 --> 32:54.537
I know where he goes
when he gets depressed.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.411
Thanks for taking us
up the mountain, Steve.

32:58.411 --> 32:59.760
Yeah, no problem.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.718
I've gotta do a flyby
of the south peak anyway.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.851
I think you and I have
to come clear it on Saturday.

33:03.851 --> 33:04.983
Cool.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.811
Avalanche control
is important, right?

33:07.811 --> 33:09.988
Hey, are you concerned at all

33:09.988 --> 33:12.294
that I'm some kind
of loose cannon

33:12.294 --> 33:13.556
and that I'll go
up there with you

33:13.556 --> 33:15.602
and just push you
off the mountain?

33:17.212 --> 33:19.475
Um, no.

33:19.475 --> 33:20.737
Ah.

33:20.737 --> 33:21.738
So you don't think
I'm a loose cannon.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.784
So you trust me. Interesting.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.178
Steve, don't you think
it's weird for someone

33:26.178 --> 33:28.397
to give you shit for spending
time with your daughter?

33:28.397 --> 33:29.529
I don't have a daughter.

33:29.529 --> 33:30.617
Yeah, but don't you think,

33:30.617 --> 33:31.966
after everything
you've been through,

33:31.966 --> 33:33.054
you've earned the right
to hang out with her?

33:33.054 --> 33:35.056
You know,
be a little more carefree.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.841
Hey, Steve, do you think
painting the bathroom

33:37.841 --> 33:39.756
a combination
of mauve and vomit

33:39.756 --> 33:41.236
makes bath time enjoyable?

33:41.236 --> 33:45.066
Steve, would you buy
a tiny coffee table

33:45.066 --> 33:47.155
that's so small, it won't even
hold coffee table books?

33:47.155 --> 33:48.939
We don't have
coffee table books.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.593
Because the coffee table
is too small.

33:50.593 --> 33:51.812
Oh, my God. I--

34:15.009 --> 34:16.271
I can't knock.

34:16.271 --> 34:17.446
I'm too nervous.

34:17.446 --> 34:19.057
This always happens
when I come here.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.580
It's OK.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.364
You just got yourself
a little case of "shy-knuckle."

34:22.364 --> 34:23.713
I'll be with you the whole way.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.975
Go ahead, make a fist.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.718
Ow.

34:28.718 --> 34:30.546
I think they're
bleeding a little.

34:31.634 --> 34:34.115
Liv. Sheriff.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.290
What's going on?

34:35.290 --> 34:38.728
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.122
And you couldn't just
send me an email?

34:41.122 --> 34:43.907
Why did I bother
learning the internet

34:43.907 --> 34:47.563
if you're just going
to show up in person?

34:49.174 --> 34:51.001
All right, come in.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.180
Wipe your feet.

34:55.180 --> 34:58.052
It's not a flophouse.

35:02.665 --> 35:05.625
Well, what is it?

35:08.671 --> 35:10.673
You know
all that stuff you say

35:10.673 --> 35:13.241
about my hair and my face

35:13.241 --> 35:15.200
and pretty much
everything about me?

35:15.200 --> 35:16.201
Yeah.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.856
It--it feels kind of mean.

35:19.856 --> 35:23.382
But it's probably
not your fault,

35:23.382 --> 35:25.601
because I know your generation
has had it hard

35:25.601 --> 35:28.474
with wars and everything,
and um,

35:28.474 --> 35:30.867
I know you were born
in Great-grandpop's hay wagon.

35:30.867 --> 35:33.609
Oh, you wanted to apologize.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.045
OK, fine.

35:35.045 --> 35:35.872
I forgive you.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.439
Is that it?
- Yep.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.963
Uh, wasn't there, uh--

35:39.963 --> 35:41.965
wasn't there something else?

35:45.360 --> 35:47.188
Ay-yi-yi.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.842
OK, I admit,

35:48.842 --> 35:51.323
I stole your
deviled egg recipe, Nana,

35:51.323 --> 35:53.760
but it's only because
I admire your cooking,

35:53.760 --> 35:55.718
and I admired you.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.938
I wanted to be like you,

35:57.938 --> 36:00.375
but then you trash-talked me
to the whole family.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.030
And now you've said
all those awful things

36:03.030 --> 36:04.553
about me in the town paper.

36:04.553 --> 36:05.728
Why would you do that?

36:05.728 --> 36:07.208
I just told the truth.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.253
I always do.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.906
Oh, really?

36:09.906 --> 36:12.692
Well, I can do
some truth-telling too.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.084
Oh.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.348
Grandmothers are
supposed to be nice

36:16.348 --> 36:18.088
and smell like cookies,

36:18.088 --> 36:21.614
but you are cruel and vicious,
and you smell like vinegar.

36:21.614 --> 36:24.573
And not that sweet balsamic
stuff that you dip bread in,

36:24.573 --> 36:26.358
but that British
french fry vinegar.

36:26.358 --> 36:27.881
OK, you're getting
a little off track.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.404
Little girls
are supposed to be happy

36:29.404 --> 36:31.841
to see their grandmas,
but I always dreaded it,

36:31.841 --> 36:34.409
because you made me feel
small and worthless,

36:34.409 --> 36:37.238
and I still feel that way,
but I'm not going to anymore,

36:37.238 --> 36:38.935
because you're the one
who's small,

36:38.935 --> 36:40.502
and you're the one
who's worthless.

36:40.502 --> 36:41.895
Dial it back a little bit.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.027
You are an old, angry
piece of---- -------,

36:44.027 --> 36:46.247
and you can take that------ deviled egg----

36:46.247 --> 36:48.902
and whip up some------ recipe
and-------

36:48.902 --> 36:51.470
jam up it up your----------!

36:51.470 --> 36:52.645
OK, all right.
That's enough.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.255
No, no, no.
I'm just getting started.

36:58.259 --> 36:59.304
She's faking it.

37:09.705 --> 37:10.793
Gary said she'll be OK.

37:10.793 --> 37:12.186
It's just a minor heart attack.

37:12.186 --> 37:14.144
I mean, she looked pale
when we showed up,

37:14.144 --> 37:17.104
so she was probably already
pre-heart attacking.

37:17.104 --> 37:18.279
Thanks.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.063
Also, I told Garrett
she's delusional.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.979
So no one will believe
her side of the story.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.938
I like living
in a small town.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.461
Yeah.
You get your recipes?

37:26.461 --> 37:28.376
Yeah.

37:28.376 --> 37:29.595
Thanks for picking the lock.

37:29.595 --> 37:30.639
Let's go.
We were never here.

38:36.836 --> 38:39.360
No way.

39:03.297 --> 39:06.169
What are you two doing here?

39:06.169 --> 39:07.606
Heather's working
with Joseph.

39:07.606 --> 39:10.609
It is bad enough
that she is gone.

39:10.609 --> 39:12.828
Now you are spreading lies
about the woman

39:12.828 --> 39:16.005
that I used to love
and now wish was dead.

39:16.005 --> 39:18.225
It's not a lie, Harry.

39:18.225 --> 39:20.923
Judy saw Heather
give Joseph a trash bag.

39:20.923 --> 39:23.143
Do you know why?

39:23.143 --> 39:25.928
Was it a blue trash bag?

39:25.928 --> 39:27.408
Yeah.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.063
She cleaned my gills
and put the gunk in there.

39:30.063 --> 39:32.674
Do you know why she'd want
to give that stuff to Joseph?

39:32.674 --> 39:35.111
My DNA.

39:35.111 --> 39:36.852
They want to clone me.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.465
They have my alien ball.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.423
They're trying
to manipulate it.

39:42.423 --> 39:46.514
But I gave it to Robert,
the alien tracker's son.

39:46.514 --> 39:49.648
If the Greys kidnapped him,
then they have the ball.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.650
You have reception here?
How?

39:51.650 --> 39:52.477
It's very easy.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.174
You just go into settings.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.393
It will prompt you.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.525
"Would you like to harness
the mountain

39:57.525 --> 39:59.222

40:02.487 --> 40:05.011
And you just push "yes."

40:05.011 --> 40:06.708
So funny.

40:06.708 --> 40:07.666
Hello, son.

40:07.666 --> 40:10.973
It is Harry, your new father.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.366
Uh, not the dead one.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.063
Uh, how are you?

40:14.063 --> 40:16.631
Are you still on Earth?

40:16.631 --> 40:18.198
Yeah.

40:18.198 --> 40:20.592
I'm at the malt shop
with the fellas.

40:23.072 --> 40:24.378
The Greys have the ball.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.467
What are they
gonna do with it?

40:26.467 --> 40:29.470
Our technology is all
hydrogen-based.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.516
It helps us manipulate water.

40:31.516 --> 40:34.040
But if the Greys can do it,
they can speed up

40:34.040 --> 40:35.824
their plans for the cavern
at Yellowstone.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.697
Wait, so they could destroy
the Earth any time now?

40:38.697 --> 40:40.525
Worse.

40:40.525 --> 40:44.093
The love of my life
did not just leave me.

40:44.093 --> 40:47.053
She betrayed me.
