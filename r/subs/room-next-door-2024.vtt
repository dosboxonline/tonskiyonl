00:09.107 --> 00:11.076
[soft orchestral music playing]

00:51.046 --> 00:52.680
[lively chatter]

00:52.815 --> 00:55.350
- [Ingrid] Hi. How are you?
- [Bobbi] I'm good. Thanks.

00:55.485 --> 00:56.711
[Ingrid] Who do I
make this out to?

00:56.847 --> 00:58.222
[Bobbi] Uh, Bobbi with an "I".

01:02.560 --> 01:04.856
In the prologue,
you say you wrote this book

01:04.991 --> 01:06.692
in order to better understand
and accept death.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.658
Um...

01:08.793 --> 01:10.895
Yeah. It feels unnatural to me.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.538
I can't accept that something
alive has to die.

01:13.673 --> 01:14.700
Thank you.

01:15.842 --> 01:16.774
- Ingrid...
- Mm.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.272
We've fulfilled the hour.

01:18.407 --> 01:19.771
I mean, in fact,
we've gone over.

01:19.906 --> 01:21.912
Well, there's still
a lot of people waiting.

01:22.047 --> 01:23.879
Yes. We'll do what you want.

01:24.015 --> 01:25.079
Could you sign mine?

01:25.215 --> 01:27.446
Stella! I didn't see you.

01:27.582 --> 01:29.181
Why didn't you
come straight up?

01:29.316 --> 01:30.655
I was embarrassed.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.056
You draw a crowd!

01:32.192 --> 01:33.385
- A lot of young people.
- Thank you.

01:33.521 --> 01:34.951
- Not just women.
- [laughs]

01:35.086 --> 01:36.952
Stella, this is Anne.
Anne, my friend Stella.

01:37.087 --> 01:38.593
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:38.728 --> 01:40.332
I'm gonna stay until
I've signed for everybody.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.633
Yes. I'll just make sure
no one else joins the line.

01:42.768 --> 01:44.497
Okay. [chuckles]

01:44.633 --> 01:46.595
Oh, I haven't seen you
in forever.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.102
I'm living in Boston now.

01:48.237 --> 01:49.635
I came to see my son,

01:49.770 --> 01:51.341
and to visit Martha
in the hospital.

01:53.277 --> 01:55.074
You know she has cancer, right?

01:55.209 --> 01:56.139
It's a bad one.

01:56.275 --> 01:57.439
Martha?

01:57.574 --> 01:58.482
Martha Hunt?

01:58.618 --> 01:59.975
Yes.

02:00.111 --> 02:01.545
She's at Manhattan Memorial
Cancer Center.

02:01.681 --> 02:03.288
I thought you would've heard.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.122
No. To be honest,
I haven't seen her in years.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.423
Martha is sick?
I can't imagine it.

02:07.559 --> 02:09.891
If you go see her,
it'll make her very happy.

02:10.026 --> 02:11.553
Yeah. Of course.

02:11.688 --> 02:13.565
Of course I will.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.601
Um, thank you
so much for coming.
I really appreciate it.

02:16.736 --> 02:17.736
Congratulations.

02:17.872 --> 02:18.970
- Thank you.
- Mm!

02:19.106 --> 02:19.968
- I'll see you soon.
- Thanks.

02:20.104 --> 02:21.096
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:23.973 --> 02:24.968
Hi.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.313
- Who do I make this out to?
- Frances.

02:30.679 --> 02:33.179
- Is that you?
- No, it's my girlfriend.

02:33.315 --> 02:34.985
She really admires you.

02:35.121 --> 02:36.683
- So do I.
- Thank you.

02:40.117 --> 02:43.019
Could you write
"It won't happen again"?

02:45.556 --> 02:47.692
Of course I can.

02:47.828 --> 02:50.202
Yes. Thank you.
It won't happen again.

02:52.596 --> 02:53.535
I hope not.

03:09.784 --> 03:12.288
Hi. I'm here
to see Martha Hunt.

03:12.424 --> 03:13.988
I think she's
on the 16th floor.

03:14.124 --> 03:15.359
Okay. One sec.

03:16.423 --> 03:17.794
[keyboard clacks]

03:17.929 --> 03:20.189
Yes. Room 1614.

03:20.324 --> 03:22.427
The elevator is at the end
of the hall, on the left.

03:22.563 --> 03:23.693
- Thanks.
- No problem.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.435
[people speaking indistinctly]

03:39.511 --> 03:40.714
[knock at door]

03:42.184 --> 03:43.178
[door opens]

03:45.989 --> 03:46.984
Martha?

03:48.322 --> 03:49.393
[Martha] Ingrid!

03:50.555 --> 03:53.022
What a surprise!

03:53.158 --> 03:55.264
- How did you hear?
- I ran into Stella.

03:55.399 --> 03:57.929
- She told me. [kisses]
- Oh.

03:58.064 --> 04:00.999
I'm so sorry, I didn't
even know you were sick.

04:01.134 --> 04:03.702
Oh, well, you with your work
and me with mine.

04:03.837 --> 04:06.407
I mean, time's gotten away
from us.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.104
Yes, and I was living in Paris.

04:08.239 --> 04:11.007
Yeah, I heard.
I've been reading about you.

04:11.143 --> 04:13.115
I know you have published
another book

04:13.251 --> 04:14.951
and it's doing very well.

04:15.086 --> 04:16.618
Thank you. [sighs]

04:17.251 --> 04:18.257
So...

04:19.386 --> 04:21.491
How are you?

04:21.626 --> 04:24.626
I'm sure you're sick
of telling everybody.

04:24.761 --> 04:28.059
Well, it's cervical cancer.
Stage three.

04:28.194 --> 04:30.928
It isn't operable,
but they're treating me, so...

04:31.064 --> 04:34.331
looks like I'm not gonna die
quite yet.

04:34.466 --> 04:39.577
Um, I've become a guinea pig
for an experimental treatment

04:39.712 --> 04:41.944
and the results are better
than the doctors expected.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.779
- Great!
- Yeah.

04:43.915 --> 04:46.274
That's great! Well, you seem
like you're in good spirits.

04:46.409 --> 04:49.582
Well, I swing between
euphoria and depression.

04:49.718 --> 04:50.986
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- [laughs]

04:51.121 --> 04:52.422
No, it's normal,

04:52.557 --> 04:54.816
and the doctors warned me,
you know.

04:54.952 --> 04:56.295
- Highs and lows.
- Mm-hmm.

04:57.159 --> 04:58.220
Mm-hmm.

04:59.197 --> 05:00.929
It'll sound absurd,

05:01.064 --> 05:06.402
but after all the accepting
and preparing to face the end,

05:06.538 --> 05:09.137
survival feels
almost disappointing.

05:09.273 --> 05:10.437
Oh, don't say that.

05:10.572 --> 05:12.311
No, I was prepared to leave.

05:15.241 --> 05:19.281
In fact, when they gave me
the initial diagnosis,

05:19.416 --> 05:20.681
I didn't want any treatment.

05:20.816 --> 05:22.145
Well, I'm glad
you changed your mind.

05:23.655 --> 05:26.453
'Cause, you know,
just the thought...

05:26.588 --> 05:28.160
And that I wouldn't know...

05:28.295 --> 05:31.055
Anyway, I realized
that I really...

05:31.190 --> 05:35.367
I'm not ready to abandon
the party just yet.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.537
But I had truly gotten
used to the idea.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.337
Well, I suppose that it's good
to get used to the idea,

05:42.473 --> 05:44.970
but without giving up, right?

05:45.105 --> 05:46.477
You've been through
a lot of wars, remember?

05:47.543 --> 05:49.271
I live with them every day.

05:52.309 --> 05:55.353
Oh, Ingrid,
I'm so happy to see you.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.682
I almost called you
a thousand times.

05:57.818 --> 05:59.348
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too!

05:59.483 --> 06:01.120
It's ridiculous that
we haven't seen each other.

06:01.255 --> 06:03.520
I promise I'm gonna visit
until you get sick of me.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.961
Will you?

06:05.096 --> 06:06.427
You promise?

06:06.562 --> 06:08.066
I'm gonna hold you to that.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.665
Your daughter knows, I guess.

06:10.870 --> 06:11.865
Yes.

06:13.530 --> 06:17.402
When I first made up my mind
to forgo any treatment,

06:17.538 --> 06:18.608
I told her...

06:19.970 --> 06:21.380
and she just said...

06:22.313 --> 06:23.448
"It's your choice."

06:24.675 --> 06:26.008
Period.

06:26.143 --> 06:29.046
As if it was something trivial,

06:29.182 --> 06:31.016
something that had
nothing to do with her.

06:32.688 --> 06:34.189
How are you two getting along?

06:34.324 --> 06:36.324
Um, same as ever.

06:36.459 --> 06:37.786
We're barely in touch.

06:37.921 --> 06:39.260
What does she do?

06:39.395 --> 06:40.762
She's doing well.

06:40.897 --> 06:43.996
She's, uh, an agent
for classical musicians.

06:47.206 --> 06:48.605
It might sound horrible,

06:50.500 --> 06:53.203
but I don't feel like
she's my daughter.

06:55.343 --> 06:58.574
I fantasize frequently about
her being swapped at birth.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.344
What?

07:00.479 --> 07:02.712
What are you talking about?
She looks just like you.

07:02.847 --> 07:04.049
She has your face.

07:05.723 --> 07:08.592
I never interested her
as a mother.

07:09.687 --> 07:10.789
Why not?

07:10.925 --> 07:12.926
I was a teenager
when I had her.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.727
I didn't know what to do
with a baby.

07:17.862 --> 07:21.095
And when we started working at
<i>Paper Magazine,</i> you remember?

07:21.231 --> 07:23.374
We practically lived at night.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.469
You remember New York
in the '80s?

07:25.604 --> 07:26.906
Yeah.

07:27.041 --> 07:28.810
Anything important
happened at night.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.944
And then I went to work
as a war correspondent,

07:36.079 --> 07:37.748
traveling constantly.

07:37.883 --> 07:40.292
And that didn't help.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.758
My work just completely
took over.

07:46.392 --> 07:49.897
I was never what a mother
is supposed to be.

07:52.163 --> 07:55.636
But Michelle started to hate me

07:55.771 --> 07:57.575
long before I was away so much.

07:59.909 --> 08:01.642
I remember feeling
her resentment

08:01.778 --> 08:03.207
even when she was
a little girl.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.553
She made herself very clear.

08:13.385 --> 08:17.826
She couldn't bear...
not having a father.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.565
She saw other girls
with their fathers

08:22.701 --> 08:24.998
and she wanted to know
about hers.

08:27.698 --> 08:30.465
At first, I told her I didn't
know who he was, but...

08:31.307 --> 08:32.872
[sighs]

08:33.008 --> 08:34.469
...it kind of
made things worse.

08:36.976 --> 08:38.107
<i>I was lying to her.</i>

08:38.243 --> 08:39.850
- [laughs]
- [lively chatter]

08:39.985 --> 08:41.520
[Martha] <i>Of course I knew
who her father was.</i>

08:42.486 --> 08:43.885
<i>His name was Fred.</i>

08:48.687 --> 08:50.056
[shouts]

08:50.191 --> 08:51.558
[Martha] <i>We dated
for a few months</i>

08:51.693 --> 08:53.558
<i>before he was drafted.</i>

08:53.693 --> 08:57.063
<i>And then went away to fight,
towards the end of Vietnam.</i>

08:58.728 --> 09:02.503
<i>When he came back,
a year later, he was...</i>

09:02.639 --> 09:04.031
<i>somebody different.</i>

09:04.167 --> 09:06.441
Fred! What happened?

09:06.577 --> 09:08.371
<i>He was a broken toy.</i>

09:10.041 --> 09:12.384
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.283
I'm here.
It's all over now, Fred.

09:14.418 --> 09:15.681
You're back home.

09:15.817 --> 09:17.182
But it's not over for me.

09:20.055 --> 09:22.088
I still got the war
inside my head.

09:24.429 --> 09:25.762
I can't get free of it.

09:28.061 --> 09:30.129
I hallucinate every single day.

09:33.134 --> 09:35.706
And I was high
practically all the time.

09:40.274 --> 09:42.174
I don't know what I'm doing
with my life,

09:43.647 --> 09:45.111
but I'm not staying here.

09:49.848 --> 09:50.886
It's all right.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.954
Feel free to do what you like.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.024
Think about
what's best for you.

10:01.298 --> 10:02.293
Okay.

10:04.499 --> 10:05.560
Thanks.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.072
Can I kiss you?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.334
- Does Michelle know this?
- Oh.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.608
She started asking
about her father

10:47.744 --> 10:49.505
as soon as she could talk.

10:52.712 --> 10:56.116
But it's not something you can
explain to a child, right?

10:57.782 --> 11:01.185
By puberty, she carved out
quite an abyss between us.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.288
It came to define
her adolescence.

11:05.358 --> 11:08.359
But, by then,
I was no longer there.

11:08.494 --> 11:11.835
I was in New York, with you,
living my life.

11:14.335 --> 11:16.432
<i>I arranged to meet Fred
one evening</i>

11:16.567 --> 11:18.508
<i>to tell him about
the situation.</i>

11:18.644 --> 11:21.541
So, I took a first aid course

11:21.676 --> 11:24.446
and, because I'm a war veteran,
they've hired me at a hospital,

11:24.581 --> 11:25.607
down in San Diego.

11:27.981 --> 11:29.512
It's good news, right?

11:31.151 --> 11:32.823
I have some news for you too.

11:34.690 --> 11:35.694
I'm pregnant.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.391
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

11:42.628 --> 11:45.000
But I was planning on moving
to San Diego next week.

11:47.364 --> 11:48.839
Then what are we gonna do?

11:48.975 --> 11:51.776
Whatever I do, my parents
will support me, so...

11:52.510 --> 11:53.503
I'm not alone.

11:55.775 --> 11:56.748
Mm.

11:59.082 --> 12:00.708
I don't think
working in a hospital

12:00.844 --> 12:03.718
was the best thing
for such a damaged person.

12:03.854 --> 12:05.218
It's the closest thing to war.

12:06.383 --> 12:08.386
He needed therapy and rehab.

12:08.521 --> 12:10.685
Yeah, that would have been
more sensible,

12:12.158 --> 12:13.798
but he wanted to be useful,

12:15.226 --> 12:17.166
to ease his conscience.

12:17.302 --> 12:21.433
He believed that helping people
between life and death...

12:21.568 --> 12:25.502
was his best chance
of getting back any peace.

12:27.211 --> 12:30.945
I could only free him
of any responsibility.

12:31.081 --> 12:33.779
He left before
Michelle was born.

12:33.914 --> 12:34.912
He never knew her.

12:35.048 --> 12:36.579
[breathing heavily]

12:38.089 --> 12:41.551
He didn't call once
to ask about her.

12:43.386 --> 12:45.153
When did you tell her?

12:45.288 --> 12:46.963
She was about 12.

12:48.660 --> 12:52.062
She wanted to know
where he was living...

12:52.198 --> 12:53.662
and I didn't know anymore.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.699
She was so insistent...

12:57.834 --> 13:00.476
that I tracked down
an old friend of his

13:00.611 --> 13:01.505
from high school,

13:03.081 --> 13:07.649
who told me that Fred
had gotten married

13:07.784 --> 13:09.645
and had recently died.

13:11.385 --> 13:14.749
I asked him
for his wife's number...

13:15.825 --> 13:18.124
and then I called her.

13:18.259 --> 13:19.831
I wanted to know
what had happened.

13:21.597 --> 13:26.035
<i>She told me they were
coming home after a trip.</i>

13:29.134 --> 13:30.303
Is that smoke?

13:31.608 --> 13:32.602
[wife] Yes.

13:33.777 --> 13:35.940
Something's on fire.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.145
There's a house on fire.

13:40.018 --> 13:42.248
We should call
the fire department.

13:42.384 --> 13:43.952
- [tinnitus ringing]
- [gunfire echoing]

13:44.088 --> 13:46.022
[screaming
and explosion echoing]

13:48.661 --> 13:50.653
- Stop the car.
- Fred...

13:52.992 --> 13:53.997
[tires screech]

13:57.494 --> 13:58.966
[wife] What are you doing?

13:59.101 --> 14:00.668
- I'm gonna take a look.
- No!

14:00.804 --> 14:02.732
That's crazy! Fred!

14:02.867 --> 14:05.240
- There might be someone inside.
- Fred, stop! Stop!

14:05.376 --> 14:08.676
Don't go in. It's dangerous!
Look at me, I'm here.

14:08.812 --> 14:10.308
Let's find a gas station

14:10.444 --> 14:11.582
and call
the fire department, please.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.110
Don't you hear the screams?

14:13.246 --> 14:15.044
No, I don't hear anything.

14:15.179 --> 14:17.081
[panting]

14:17.217 --> 14:19.891
Fred, please! Fred! Fred!

14:21.022 --> 14:22.357
Fred, don't go in there!

14:22.493 --> 14:23.521
[groans]

14:25.390 --> 14:26.830
Don't you hear the screams?

14:26.966 --> 14:28.867
There's someone inside
crying for help!

14:30.963 --> 14:32.002
Fred!

14:39.808 --> 14:41.203
[panting]

14:41.339 --> 14:43.710
[firetruck horn blaring]

14:43.845 --> 14:46.009
Sir! Sir!

14:46.144 --> 14:48.048
Please, help me!

14:48.184 --> 14:50.416
- Sir! Sir, please!
- Let's go!

14:50.551 --> 14:52.721
- Please, my husband's inside!
- Ladder up!

14:52.857 --> 14:54.381
Sir! My husband's inside!

14:54.517 --> 14:55.927
My husband's inside!

14:56.062 --> 14:57.355
He thought he heard
voices crying for help.

14:57.491 --> 14:58.753
Put two lines
on the back side, guys!

14:58.888 --> 15:00.490
He went into the house
trying to save

15:00.626 --> 15:02.198
whoever was trapped
by the fire.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.225
Okay, get back in your car.
Do not go over there.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.627
I will stay here. Okay.

15:04.762 --> 15:06.234
Please, ma'am.
Is there someone else?

15:06.370 --> 15:07.395
- No, I don't know!
- Ladder up, guys! Ladder!

15:07.531 --> 15:08.773
There's a civilian inside!

15:08.909 --> 15:10.000
Get back in your car,
ma'am, please.

15:10.136 --> 15:11.699
[busy chatter]

15:11.835 --> 15:12.971
[chief] All right,
get in there!

15:13.107 --> 15:15.307
Get in that top window.

15:15.443 --> 15:18.246
There you go.
It's gonna blow out.

15:20.849 --> 15:21.876
Good boys.

15:24.518 --> 15:26.551
[indistinct police
radio chatter]

15:31.592 --> 15:33.188
I'm sorry, there was nothing
we could do.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.460
[panting]

15:36.233 --> 15:39.103
He didn't get
to the second floor.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.462
He must have passed out
from the smoke and the flames.

15:41.597 --> 15:42.804
And the other bodies?

15:42.939 --> 15:44.438
There was nobody else.

15:44.573 --> 15:46.402
This house has been abandoned
for a long time.

15:46.537 --> 15:47.576
There was only your husband.

15:47.711 --> 15:50.113
But he...

15:50.248 --> 15:52.648
he told me he heard
screams for help...

15:52.783 --> 15:54.117
Impossible, ma'am.

15:55.248 --> 15:56.284
There was no one else.

15:57.347 --> 15:58.385
It's true.

16:00.422 --> 16:02.653
I didn't hear
the screams either.

16:04.394 --> 16:07.255
I tried to stop him
from going in, but...

16:07.390 --> 16:08.498
[sobbing]

16:08.633 --> 16:09.632
I didn't.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.759
He was very brave.

16:11.895 --> 16:13.595
Did you tell
Michelle all of this?

16:13.730 --> 16:16.437
I had to give her every detail.

16:16.572 --> 16:19.443
I even gave her her father's
wife's phone number.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.935
You know what?

16:21.070 --> 16:22.770
Let's get you back to bed.
You're tired.

16:22.906 --> 16:24.211
Yeah, but I have
to tell you this.

16:24.346 --> 16:26.512
We can...
We can talk more later.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.515
So, one day...

16:31.991 --> 16:34.689
- I got a call from Fred's wife.
- Okay.

16:34.824 --> 16:36.454
And she told me

16:36.590 --> 16:38.687
- that she wanted an address.
- Mm-hmm.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.354
She wanted to
send me something.

16:40.489 --> 16:41.697
[Ingrid] Mm-hm.

16:41.833 --> 16:44.135
And, shortly after,

16:44.270 --> 16:47.335
I received a note
in the mail and a letter...

16:48.998 --> 16:51.141
that the wife received
from Michelle,

16:52.404 --> 16:54.173
introducing herself

16:54.308 --> 16:56.179
and saying that it was her,

16:56.978 --> 16:58.542
Fred's daughter,

16:58.678 --> 17:00.975
who had been
in the burning house.

17:02.284 --> 17:05.449
"It was me he tried to save."

17:05.584 --> 17:09.851
"It was me for whom he died..."

17:09.987 --> 17:12.496
that's what Michelle
said to the wife.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.990
That's insane!

17:14.126 --> 17:15.099
Yes.

17:19.169 --> 17:21.171
[cell phone ringtone playing]

17:23.102 --> 17:24.670
Hi!

17:24.806 --> 17:26.207
[Martha over phone]
<i>It's Martha, the nuisance.</i>

17:26.343 --> 17:28.172
[chuckles] You're not
a nuisance.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.713
How're you feeling?

17:29.848 --> 17:31.377
<i>Fine. I'm at home.</i>

17:31.512 --> 17:33.742
The hospital's given me
a few days off

17:33.878 --> 17:35.577
between treatments,
so I'm at home.

17:35.713 --> 17:37.649
I'd love for you to come over.

17:37.784 --> 17:40.551
Ooh, you've caught me
in the middle of moving.

17:40.687 --> 17:43.357
Oh, then you're
really busy, right?

17:43.493 --> 17:46.428
Um, well, you know
what moving's like.

17:46.563 --> 17:50.693
But, um, if you're feeling
lonely, I could stop by,

17:50.829 --> 17:52.365
we could take a walk
in the park.

17:52.501 --> 17:54.895
I might not be quite up
for a walk.

17:55.031 --> 17:58.066
Um, okay, you know what?
Let me, um...

17:58.201 --> 18:01.739
Let me finish what I'm doing
and I'll be right over.

18:01.874 --> 18:05.083
Thanks, sweetheart,
but don't feel obliged.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.730
[doorbell dings]

18:29.539 --> 18:32.769
- These are for you.
- You are a darling.

18:32.905 --> 18:34.303
And I've brought you
a couple of books.

18:34.439 --> 18:36.143
Oh! Thank you.

18:36.278 --> 18:37.440
You want something to drink?

18:37.575 --> 18:39.709
Oh. I'd love some tea.

18:39.844 --> 18:41.986
- Herbal tea if you have it.
- Sure.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.122
- I'll put these in a vase.
- Okay.

18:45.419 --> 18:47.858
And all of this is for you.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.420
You have to finish all of it.

18:49.556 --> 18:51.760
Wow! Well, I will do my best.

18:51.896 --> 18:53.390
I love fruit.

18:53.526 --> 18:55.265
[Martha and Ingrid laugh]

18:57.532 --> 18:58.999
Are you working
on something new?

18:59.135 --> 19:00.964
Um, yeah, actually I am.

19:01.099 --> 19:04.367
I'm doing research
on the painter Dora Carrington

19:04.503 --> 19:06.641
and her, um... Mm...

19:06.777 --> 19:09.439
...intense relationship with
the writer Lytton Strachey.

19:09.575 --> 19:11.573
- Mm-hm.
- Here he is.

19:11.708 --> 19:13.450
Uh, Strachey was gay,

19:13.586 --> 19:18.485
so she married the straight man
that he was infatuated with.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.350
It's gonna be
the story of the trio.

19:20.486 --> 19:22.191
It isn't groundbreaking,

19:22.327 --> 19:23.693
but I want to see
where it takes me.

19:23.828 --> 19:25.323
Here, um, look.

19:25.459 --> 19:26.824
Um, unfortunately for her,

19:26.959 --> 19:29.297
there was another
more famous painter...

19:29.433 --> 19:30.793
- Leonora Carrington. Yeah.
- Yes,

19:30.928 --> 19:32.533
the surrealist
Leonora Carrington,

19:32.668 --> 19:34.667
whose name was obviously
very similar to hers.

19:35.874 --> 19:36.966
[Ingrid] Um...

19:37.676 --> 19:38.770
Dora...

19:39.737 --> 19:41.639
was better known for this

19:41.775 --> 19:44.039
bizarre love story
with Strachey.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.214
She devoted 17 years
of her life to him.

19:49.349 --> 19:50.549
- Wow.
- Mm.

19:50.685 --> 19:53.055
It'll be a fictionalized
biography, so...

19:53.191 --> 19:56.117
I'll make some stuff up, too.

19:56.252 --> 20:00.094
I've never been able
to allow myself that.

20:00.229 --> 20:03.064
Mm. Well, I hope not.

20:03.199 --> 20:04.933
You're a war reporter.

20:05.069 --> 20:07.062
Yeah, you have to...

20:07.197 --> 20:08.735
You know,
you can't show your emotions.

20:08.870 --> 20:12.706
You have to block them out
so you can do your job

20:12.841 --> 20:15.412
and stay in the present
in the middle of whatever hell.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.947
Maybe I should write about you
and not Carrington.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.448
I don't think you'd enjoy

20:19.583 --> 20:21.284
writing about
illnesses and treatments.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.219
- Mm. You're wrong.
- I'm just a journalist,

20:24.355 --> 20:27.055
addicted to wars
and adrenaline.

20:27.191 --> 20:28.259
You think that's nothing?

20:30.622 --> 20:32.191
It wasn't all tragedy.

20:32.327 --> 20:33.693
You know, life went on.

20:35.766 --> 20:39.094
There was one report
when I added a bit of fiction.

20:39.705 --> 20:40.730
Really?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.999
Actually, I never published it.

20:45.001 --> 20:46.904
It was during the war in Iraq.

20:47.040 --> 20:50.378
<i>On the last day,
before we left Baghdad.</i>

20:50.514 --> 20:52.106
Are you sure
this is the right way?

20:52.242 --> 20:55.044
Yeah, just make a left here
in this alley.

20:56.384 --> 20:57.618
Let's make this brief.

21:01.156 --> 21:02.154
Here. Stop here.

21:02.289 --> 21:03.558
[brakes screech]

21:09.759 --> 21:10.697
[speaking Spanish]

21:12.504 --> 21:15.130
Martin, what are you doing
here in Baghdad?

21:17.374 --> 21:18.775
You look great. You really do.

21:18.910 --> 21:19.900
Thank you.

21:20.036 --> 21:21.835
Yeah, I'm sorry. Paco, Martin.

21:21.971 --> 21:23.347
He's a Carmelite, like me.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.275
Pleasure. Let me introduce you
to Martha.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.642
She is a brilliant journalist
from <i>The New York Times.</i>

21:27.777 --> 21:28.918
[speaking Spanish]

21:29.054 --> 21:30.117
They are the Carmelites

21:30.253 --> 21:31.419
I was telling you about.

21:31.554 --> 21:32.883
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

21:33.019 --> 21:34.825
Are you intending
to stay in Baghdad?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.189
Yes, here we are.

21:36.324 --> 21:37.857
But you're alone.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.298
All the NGOs and the Red Cross
have left already.

21:40.931 --> 21:42.165
I know.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.065
The situation is
out of control.

21:44.201 --> 21:45.462
It's very dangerous.

21:45.598 --> 21:46.896
You're here as well.

21:47.032 --> 21:48.604
Yeah, but we're
just passing through.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.469
We're leaving as soon as
we finish talking to you.

21:50.604 --> 21:52.308
We can't let them down now,

21:52.444 --> 21:53.972
this is when the people
need us most.

21:54.107 --> 21:57.777
That's true, but it's still
extremely dangerous.

21:59.447 --> 22:01.108
But then you know that.

22:01.244 --> 22:03.354
We can't
let them down now, <i>señora.</i>

22:04.820 --> 22:06.322
Do you mind
if we take a photo of you

22:06.457 --> 22:08.221
and how the mission
has been left?

22:08.356 --> 22:09.627
[speaking Spanish]

22:09.762 --> 22:11.053
Okay.

22:11.189 --> 22:13.322
You can photograph
the mission and me,

22:13.458 --> 22:16.760
but he doesn't want to risk
his family in Spain seeing him.

22:16.896 --> 22:18.469
- They'd worry.
- Yeah, of course.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.035
Totally understand,
but if we could get one of you,

22:20.171 --> 22:21.368
that would be great.

22:21.503 --> 22:22.866
- [Bernardo] Okay.
- Sure.

22:23.002 --> 22:24.175
[mechanical whirring
in distance]

22:24.310 --> 22:25.673
- [Bernardo] Here?
- [Martin] Yeah.

22:25.808 --> 22:28.435
Just perhaps
a little tiny step closer...

22:28.570 --> 22:30.277
Yeah, that's fine,
so that I can see the impacts.

22:30.413 --> 22:31.349
[camera shutter clicking]

22:33.247 --> 22:34.209
[laughs]

22:36.187 --> 22:37.212
I think you have it.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.685
How long has it been...

22:41.821 --> 22:43.090
since we last saw each other?

22:43.225 --> 22:44.795
Five years.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.155
Five years.

22:47.294 --> 22:48.322
Wow.

22:49.695 --> 22:50.797
Do you remember Liberia?

22:51.697 --> 22:52.832
How could I forget?

22:54.970 --> 22:58.674
Look, I have some photos of you
that we didn't publish.

22:58.809 --> 23:00.703
If you give me an address,
I can send them to you.

23:00.838 --> 23:01.802
Maybe to the Embassy.

23:01.937 --> 23:03.642
No, you keep them.

23:03.777 --> 23:05.515
That way I'll keep you company.

23:06.643 --> 23:07.583
Okay.

23:10.047 --> 23:11.422
It was really great seeing you.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.255
Take care.

23:13.390 --> 23:14.623
- Goodbye.
- Be safe.

23:19.463 --> 23:20.761
How do you know the Carmelite?

23:24.026 --> 23:25.062
We met in Sierra Leone.

23:27.370 --> 23:29.204
We became lovers there.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.936
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.267
After that, we met more times.

23:34.403 --> 23:36.737
Always in places
that were at war.

23:36.872 --> 23:38.081
And you had sex?

23:38.216 --> 23:40.582
Well, of course, yeah.

23:40.718 --> 23:42.783
Bernardo never renounced
physical pleasure.

23:44.282 --> 23:47.051
He was always in
the most conflictive places.

23:47.186 --> 23:49.427
And I think that sex
was his best shield.

23:51.894 --> 23:54.227
I'm pretty sure
the Carmelite is his partner.

23:54.363 --> 23:55.426
You think so?

23:55.561 --> 23:57.666
Definitely.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.301
That is the only way
you can stay in Baghdad

23:59.437 --> 24:00.438
and not be afraid of the war.

24:01.835 --> 24:04.035
- What a wonderful story.
- Yup.

24:06.068 --> 24:07.033
Don't you dare write it.

24:07.169 --> 24:09.205
No, no, no, of course not.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.944
But how about sin for him?

24:15.079 --> 24:16.252
I mean, don't they feel guilty?

24:16.388 --> 24:18.116
After all, they are Catholic.

24:18.251 --> 24:20.216
Yeah, I don't know.
He never talked about that.

24:22.385 --> 24:24.954
With all the horrors
you see in war,

24:25.089 --> 24:26.693
feeling guilty about having sex

24:26.829 --> 24:27.993
doesn't really
carry much weight,

24:29.158 --> 24:30.193
you simply get used to it.

24:31.399 --> 24:32.470
I know that.

24:35.900 --> 24:37.507
I wrote their story,

24:37.642 --> 24:39.972
their love story,
as I imagined it,

24:41.237 --> 24:42.810
but it stayed in my computer.

24:45.016 --> 24:49.282
So, you're gonna write about
Dora Carrington's insane love.

24:49.417 --> 24:50.685
[Ingrid] Mm-hm.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.148
And her connection
to Virginia Woolf,

24:52.284 --> 24:55.290
who Strachey
also pursued romantically.

24:55.425 --> 24:56.786
[Martha] What a group!

24:56.922 --> 24:59.288
I so admire their freedom.

24:59.423 --> 25:01.022
[Ingrid] Strachey died
of stomach cancer

25:01.157 --> 25:03.325
18 years after meeting Dora

25:03.460 --> 25:06.194
and Dora survived him
by barely two months

25:06.330 --> 25:08.499
before she shot herself
in the stomach.

25:08.634 --> 25:11.169
She was only 38.

25:11.304 --> 25:14.308
I'm struck by the symmetry
of that kind of gesture,

25:14.443 --> 25:15.676
his stomach cancer

25:15.812 --> 25:17.741
and her shooting herself
in the stomach.

25:17.877 --> 25:20.180
I know, it struck me, too.

25:20.315 --> 25:24.550
I wonder what Virginia Woolf
thought of Carrington's death?

25:24.685 --> 25:27.156
Maybe Virginia saw...

25:27.291 --> 25:28.390
a kind of warning,

25:28.525 --> 25:31.051
a mirror that reflected her?

25:31.186 --> 25:32.387
As if they were fated?

25:34.993 --> 25:36.891
Do you think I'm fated, too?

25:37.026 --> 25:39.735
No! Of course not.

25:39.870 --> 25:42.331
I've never known anyone
more alive than you.

25:42.466 --> 25:45.002
This week I'm starting
a new experimental

25:45.138 --> 25:47.275
- immunotherapy treatment.
- Uh-huh.

25:47.411 --> 25:49.109
They've already tried it

25:49.245 --> 25:51.205
and it seems to work well
with cases of cervical cancer.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.013
- Well, that's great news!
- Yeah.

25:54.148 --> 25:55.382
Let me know
when I can come and visit you,

25:55.517 --> 25:56.686
- okay?
- I will.

25:59.019 --> 26:01.388
- Talking of symmetry...
- Mm-hmm?

26:01.523 --> 26:02.560
Do you remember...

26:03.591 --> 26:04.793
Damian Cunningham?

26:05.858 --> 26:07.662
How could I forget?

26:07.797 --> 26:10.265
I inherited him
from you. [laughs]

26:10.400 --> 26:12.061
The shared lover.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.602
- Well, I...
- I have to say

26:13.738 --> 26:15.402
I felt terrible
when you got together

26:15.538 --> 26:16.770
after I'd been with him.

26:16.905 --> 26:18.375
Okay, we didn't
share him exactly

26:18.510 --> 26:19.707
because you'd already broken up

26:19.843 --> 26:20.805
and you were
out of the country.

26:20.941 --> 26:22.371
I would never go back with him

26:22.506 --> 26:25.274
and, to tell the truth,
I was never faithful.

26:25.410 --> 26:30.145
But he was a passionate
and enthusiastic lover

26:30.280 --> 26:32.287
and I hope he was for you, too.

26:32.423 --> 26:33.452
I had no complaints.

26:33.587 --> 26:35.593
[both laughing]

26:37.287 --> 26:38.794
[people speaking indistinctly]

26:49.239 --> 26:50.234
Hi.

26:52.903 --> 26:53.908
What is it?

26:55.940 --> 26:56.944
It hasn't worked.

26:58.209 --> 27:00.209
I've got metastases in my liver

27:00.344 --> 27:02.147
- and in my bones.
- Oh, Martha.

27:02.282 --> 27:04.150
I should have followed
my first instinct.

27:04.286 --> 27:06.820
Should never have put myself
through this torture.

27:06.956 --> 27:09.390
This diarrhea,
vomiting, fatigue...

27:09.526 --> 27:11.618
to end up like this.

27:11.753 --> 27:13.822
I should never have given in
to false hope.

27:13.957 --> 27:15.258
Okay. Okay.

27:15.393 --> 27:17.164
All right,
what does the doctor say?

27:17.300 --> 27:18.468
Tell me.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.994
Oh, that I could
live for months,

27:21.130 --> 27:23.003
maybe a year.

27:23.138 --> 27:25.232
He wants me to continue
with the treatment,

27:25.368 --> 27:26.805
even though it looks hopeless.

27:26.941 --> 27:28.303
Maybe it will work this time.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.439
I don't wanna wallow
in self-pity.

27:36.522 --> 27:39.216
But I'm not a stoic. I'm sorry.

27:39.352 --> 27:43.453
I don't wanna go through
excruciating pain.

27:43.588 --> 27:45.993
You can't be self-possessed
if you're in agony.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.961
You can't think straight.

27:49.096 --> 27:50.728
You can only think
of one thing...

27:50.864 --> 27:52.230
the fucking cancer.

27:52.863 --> 27:55.001
[sighs]

27:55.136 --> 27:56.707
I've always taken care
of my health,

27:57.737 --> 27:59.609
now I regret it.

27:59.745 --> 28:01.343
The doctor says
I have a strong heart.

28:01.479 --> 28:02.810
What does that mean?

28:02.946 --> 28:04.980
My body is just
gonna go on fighting...

28:05.115 --> 28:08.018
while I suffer and suffer
until my last breath?

28:08.153 --> 28:09.152
[sobs]

28:09.288 --> 28:10.347
I don't know.

28:12.316 --> 28:13.856
I don't know how to help you.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.353
I'm so sorry.

28:21.127 --> 28:23.558
I think I deserve a good death.

28:26.202 --> 28:29.738
At least one without
convulsions in my last moments.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.735
Going out with
a little bit of dignity,

28:31.871 --> 28:33.469
clean and dry.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.181
But I know
I'm asking too much...

28:38.316 --> 28:39.606
[door opens]

28:39.742 --> 28:40.581
[nurse] What are you
doing up, Martha?

28:40.716 --> 28:42.312
I'm fucking over this.

28:42.448 --> 28:44.244
- Can you help her, please?
- Of course.

28:44.380 --> 28:45.655
Let's get you back in bed.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.725
[Ingrid] Come on.
Let me help you.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.589
Bring it on.

28:50.724 --> 28:51.762
Here we go.

28:54.690 --> 28:56.626
I'll end up
turning into a junkie.

28:56.762 --> 28:57.928
[sighs]

28:58.064 --> 28:59.995
I am one already, I guess.

29:00.130 --> 29:02.835
It's okay. Really.

29:02.971 --> 29:04.940
[nurse] Here, this will help.

29:43.273 --> 29:44.309
Are you still here?

29:45.844 --> 29:46.817
Yes.

29:50.285 --> 29:52.185
Should I ask them
to bring your dinner?

29:53.622 --> 29:54.616
Are you hungry?

29:55.392 --> 29:56.354
No.

29:59.463 --> 30:00.457
Ingrid...

30:02.901 --> 30:04.962
Do you think
I need to say goodbye

30:05.097 --> 30:06.969
to my closest friends?

30:07.105 --> 30:09.334
I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

30:10.466 --> 30:12.975
I just want peace and quiet.

30:14.806 --> 30:18.079
Have you thought about
how you wanna spend your time?

30:20.110 --> 30:21.818
And where?

30:21.954 --> 30:23.612
Is there some place
you'd like to go?

30:24.817 --> 30:25.823
Look.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.962
Pink snowflakes.

30:35.431 --> 30:38.528
There had to be something good
about climate change.

30:40.767 --> 30:41.795
Well...

30:43.432 --> 30:45.040
I've lived to see that.

30:50.115 --> 30:53.012
You remember the end
of Joyce's <i>The Dead?</i>

30:53.147 --> 30:54.852
[sniffles, voice breaks]
Vaguely.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.053
"The snow was falling,

30:59.782 --> 31:03.320
falling on
the lonely churchyard,

31:03.456 --> 31:06.391
falling faintly
through the universe.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.229
And faintly falling,

31:11.364 --> 31:14.498
like the descent
of their last end,

31:16.633 --> 31:21.373
on all
the living and the dead."

31:24.811 --> 31:25.747
[gulps]

31:25.882 --> 31:27.412
It's getting late and, uh...

31:28.718 --> 31:29.711
I should be going.

31:32.590 --> 31:33.583
[Ingrid sniffles]

31:37.792 --> 31:38.753
Thank you.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.899
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:42.994 --> 31:43.934
[kisses]

32:28.972 --> 32:31.642
There's still a half an hour
before the movie starts.

32:31.777 --> 32:33.917
Should we go in and get
our seats before the rush?

32:34.052 --> 32:36.085
No. I wanna talk to you
about something.

32:36.850 --> 32:38.219
Okay.

32:38.354 --> 32:40.781
I will not go out
in mortifying anguish.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.652
I've gotten hold
of a euthanasia pill.

32:43.551 --> 32:44.951
Don't ask me how,

32:45.086 --> 32:47.490
on the dark web
you can find almost anything.

32:47.626 --> 32:49.664
I also have
an abundance of opioids

32:49.800 --> 32:51.031
for the moments of pain.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.629
And don't look at me like that,

32:52.765 --> 32:54.730
I'm not asking you
to convince me otherwise.

32:55.697 --> 32:57.673
I don't know what to say.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.141
I'm hoping you'll say yes.

33:00.171 --> 33:01.678
Yes to what?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.508
To my asking you to help me.

33:04.242 --> 33:05.609
Help you what?

33:06.918 --> 33:09.479
I've faced death several times,

33:09.614 --> 33:11.747
but I've always
been accompanied.

33:11.882 --> 33:15.190
We reporters formed
a kind of mobile family.

33:17.124 --> 33:18.688
This is another war,

33:19.764 --> 33:21.031
I'm not afraid of it.

33:21.598 --> 33:22.789
But...

33:22.925 --> 33:24.958
like the other times
I faced death...

33:26.905 --> 33:28.863
I don't wanna be alone, Ingrid.

33:31.368 --> 33:32.735
I'm asking you...

33:33.679 --> 33:35.705
to be in the next room.

33:37.148 --> 33:38.774
I think we should
go get our seats.

33:38.909 --> 33:41.617
Yeah, sure, but I prefer
to go on talking to you,

33:41.752 --> 33:42.877
if you don't mind.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.914
Okay. Um...

33:48.994 --> 33:50.489
Do you know when
you wanna do this?

33:51.453 --> 33:52.425
Not exactly.

33:53.488 --> 33:54.493
Within a month?

33:56.600 --> 34:00.565
Before I start to deteriorate
and you don't recognize me.

34:00.700 --> 34:04.530
These next weeks
I should be reasonably well,

34:04.666 --> 34:06.339
but I wanna do it soon.

34:06.475 --> 34:08.568
My doctors think that
I'm gonna return

34:08.704 --> 34:10.673
to complete the treatment.

34:10.809 --> 34:13.149
It's best they don't
suspect anything.

34:14.116 --> 34:15.883
Where do you wanna do it?

34:16.019 --> 34:17.285
I don't wanna be at home.

34:19.755 --> 34:22.719
And I don't wanna go back
to anywhere I've been happy.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.421
It's always a mistake
to return to some place

34:27.557 --> 34:29.089
you've been truly happy.

34:29.224 --> 34:31.525
You just ruin the good memories
of the first time.

34:31.660 --> 34:33.269
No, I understand that.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.568
I think it will be easier
for me to let myself go

34:36.703 --> 34:40.774
if I'm not surrounded
by familiar things,

34:40.909 --> 34:42.737
intimate things.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.906
I think that would
hold me back.

34:47.479 --> 34:50.450
I prefer some unknown place,

34:51.515 --> 34:53.387
comfortable and safe,

34:54.353 --> 34:56.718
and not too far away.

34:56.854 --> 34:58.959
Do you need my help
finding a place

34:59.095 --> 35:01.256
or getting you settled in?

35:01.391 --> 35:03.461
No, no, no.

35:03.596 --> 35:05.102
No, I can
take care of that part.

35:06.865 --> 35:09.733
What I need is somebody
to be there with me,

35:10.941 --> 35:12.406
in the room next door.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.811
Wouldn't you prefer
someone you're closer to?

35:16.946 --> 35:18.279
We're very close.

35:18.415 --> 35:20.349
No, yes, of course,
of course we are.

35:20.484 --> 35:22.779
[stammers] Oh, my God,
we're very close. I just...

35:22.915 --> 35:24.917
There were years where
we didn't see each other.

35:25.053 --> 35:25.985
[sharp inhale]

35:26.120 --> 35:27.580
What about Stella?

35:27.716 --> 35:28.954
[stammering] Or Maggie?

35:29.089 --> 35:30.490
Or Vanessa?

35:30.625 --> 35:32.192
You've all been friends
since you were kids.

35:32.328 --> 35:34.659
I admit I thought
of them first.

35:35.725 --> 35:37.398
I asked all three of them.

35:37.533 --> 35:40.797
They all were horrified
and they all said no.

35:42.137 --> 35:43.503
They understood it,

35:43.638 --> 35:45.469
but they said
they could never be a part

35:45.604 --> 35:47.434
of helping me take my own life.

35:47.569 --> 35:49.236
Absolutely not.

35:49.372 --> 35:51.313
- What about your daughter?
- It wouldn't be fair to her.

35:52.808 --> 35:54.809
I've been an absent mother.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.684
I don't wanna impose
my dying on her.

35:56.819 --> 36:00.989
You could at least consult her
and let her be a part of it.

36:01.124 --> 36:02.819
We're two strangers, Ingrid.

36:04.526 --> 36:06.260
She made that clear
when I told her

36:06.396 --> 36:08.121
about my doubts
about the treatment.

36:09.429 --> 36:11.168
"It's your choice" she said.

36:12.836 --> 36:13.962
And she's right.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.535
Right.

36:26.977 --> 36:28.581
- [horns blaring]
- [wind whooshing]

36:32.858 --> 36:36.193
[breathing heavily]

36:42.294 --> 36:44.397
No matter what,

36:44.532 --> 36:46.698
people want you
to keep fighting.

36:48.429 --> 36:52.165
This is the way we've
been taught to see cancer.

36:52.300 --> 36:57.377
As a fight...
between patient and disease,

36:57.513 --> 37:00.708
which is to say
between good and evil.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.945
If you survive, you're a hero.

37:04.086 --> 37:05.915
If you lose, well,

37:07.556 --> 37:09.358
perhaps you didn't
fight hard enough.

37:11.956 --> 37:13.720
People don't like
using words like

37:13.856 --> 37:16.999
"terminal" or "incurable."

37:17.135 --> 37:19.663
They call that defeatist talk.

37:19.798 --> 37:21.432
Some of the worst stuff
comes from

37:21.568 --> 37:24.065
the cancer support community.

37:24.201 --> 37:27.066
Some of them think
of your cancer as a gift,

37:27.202 --> 37:29.877
an opportunity
for spiritual growth.

37:30.012 --> 37:31.744
Bullshit!

37:31.879 --> 37:34.944
People should see
this is my way of fighting.

37:37.114 --> 37:40.257
Cancer can't get me
if I get me first.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.526
And what's the point
in waiting...

37:46.756 --> 37:48.089
when I'm so ready to go?

37:49.862 --> 37:52.062
Are you completely sure
you're ready?

37:52.198 --> 37:53.969
Totally.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.064
Since the first diagnosis.

37:58.201 --> 38:00.576
You know I have
a terrible fear of death.

38:00.712 --> 38:01.734
I know.

38:01.870 --> 38:03.146
I've read your book.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.315
That's why
I didn't ask you first.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.983
But you understand me,
don't you?

38:09.119 --> 38:10.779
I do, I do. I envy you.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.587
You're in control of your life.

38:12.722 --> 38:15.958
I only need you to accompany me
the days leading to it,

38:16.094 --> 38:18.657
as if we were on vacation.

38:18.792 --> 38:21.297
I just wanna know that,
when it happens,

38:21.433 --> 38:23.459
there'll be someone
in the next room.

38:23.595 --> 38:25.064
It terrifies me, Martha.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.633
I understand.

38:26.769 --> 38:28.035
I think that you have
every right to do this

38:28.171 --> 38:29.869
and I admire you for it,

38:30.005 --> 38:31.665
but I don't know that I can be
the one to find you dead.

38:31.801 --> 38:33.200
I'm not that strong.

38:33.335 --> 38:34.839
You're much stronger
than you think you are.

38:37.477 --> 38:39.943
Anyway, I had to try.

38:42.382 --> 38:43.845
[Ingrid sighs]

38:43.980 --> 38:45.585
I can't answer you now, Martha,

38:45.721 --> 38:47.148
but I promise you
I'll think about it.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.825
Right now I'm too confused
and too terrified.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.456
I understand.

38:51.591 --> 38:53.330
I understand it's sudden...

38:55.429 --> 38:57.092
and it's disconcerting.

39:01.666 --> 39:02.999
I'll think of someone.

39:13.483 --> 39:15.847
- I wasn't too much?
- No, no.

39:51.385 --> 39:53.214
[line ringing]

39:55.855 --> 39:57.917
- Martha?
- [Martha] <i>Hello, Ingrid.</i>

39:58.052 --> 39:59.396
I've made up my mind.

40:02.824 --> 40:03.763
Come on in.

40:05.096 --> 40:07.262
The owner is
a jewelry designer.

40:07.397 --> 40:10.136
She's a friend of mine,
so I don't pay much rent.

40:10.272 --> 40:11.804
[Damian] Mmm.

40:11.939 --> 40:13.802
You get the impression
it's been furnished

40:13.937 --> 40:15.845
with stuff from the garbage.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.243
Not everything.

40:18.378 --> 40:21.448
And it takes talent
to pick stuff
out of the garbage.

40:21.583 --> 40:23.912
You haven't finished moving in.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.181
- Do you want a hand?
- Uh...

40:26.914 --> 40:28.117
No. [sighs]

40:30.688 --> 40:33.055
I'll do it after.

40:33.191 --> 40:36.597
And even so,
you're going with Martha.

40:36.732 --> 40:40.460
[sighs] She is totally
alone, Damian.

40:40.595 --> 40:42.834
None of her friends
are helping her with this.

40:42.970 --> 40:46.069
She even told me
I wasn't her first choice.

40:46.204 --> 40:48.309
It's like her daughter
doesn't even exist.

40:48.444 --> 40:49.775
In the years I was with her,

40:49.911 --> 40:51.442
she never told me
she had a daughter.

40:51.577 --> 40:53.246
I know, it's a...

40:53.381 --> 40:54.714
It's a sad story.

40:54.850 --> 40:58.048
It's a terrible,
terrible misunderstanding.

41:01.351 --> 41:03.189
Have you told her
that we're in touch?

41:03.324 --> 41:05.925
Uh... No.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.531
Um, we talked about you
in a... in a general way.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.631
- She has nice memories of you.
- Oh. Really?

41:11.767 --> 41:14.131
Our relationship
was mostly physical.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.936
She was always about
to go off somewhere else,

41:17.071 --> 41:21.401
that's why our lovemaking
had that sense of urgency.

41:21.536 --> 41:23.775
It was like having sex
with a terrorist...

41:23.910 --> 41:25.406
it always felt
like the last time.

41:25.541 --> 41:27.779
Well, she rates you
pretty highly as a lover.

41:27.915 --> 41:29.476
I'd like to know
what rating you give me.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.785
Oh, I can't believe
you're still flirting with me.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.457
- I'm serious.
- No, no, you're not serious.

41:34.592 --> 41:37.118
What's serious
is Martha's situation.

41:37.253 --> 41:39.627
And your being terrified
of death?

41:39.762 --> 41:41.663
You just published
a book about that.

41:41.798 --> 41:43.794
Have you overcome that,
thanks to the book?

41:43.929 --> 41:45.865
- No.
- [cell phone ringing]

41:54.771 --> 41:56.645
Hi. How are you?

41:57.278 --> 41:58.446
Better.

41:58.581 --> 42:01.207
Much better since you said yes.

42:01.342 --> 42:02.985
Where are you? Are you at home?

42:03.120 --> 42:04.218
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:04.354 --> 42:05.986
I'm watering the plants.

42:06.121 --> 42:08.551
Oh, I thought you had someone
who did that for you.

42:08.686 --> 42:10.320
<i>I do.</i>

42:10.455 --> 42:12.920
But today I felt like doing it
and I am enjoying it.

42:13.056 --> 42:15.225
[chuckles] <i>Okay. Good.</i>

42:15.360 --> 42:19.431
Um, have you... Have you
decided where we're going?

42:19.567 --> 42:21.798
That's why I called.

42:21.934 --> 42:23.363
<i>It's, uh, near Woodstock,</i>

42:23.499 --> 42:25.404
<i>it's about two hours
from the city.</i>

42:25.540 --> 42:27.004
It looks fantastic.

42:27.139 --> 42:29.808
Uh, it's a bit expensive,
but, hey,

42:29.944 --> 42:32.307
the occasion
calls for it. [laughs]

42:33.615 --> 42:35.779
So, do you know how long...

42:35.914 --> 42:37.444
I've rented it for a month.

42:37.579 --> 42:40.053
That should give me
more than enough time.

42:40.189 --> 42:41.180
A month?

42:41.316 --> 42:43.555
<i>Yeah. My blood count's low</i>

42:43.691 --> 42:45.219
and I have to take a break

42:45.355 --> 42:46.792
before I start
the new treatment,

42:46.927 --> 42:48.090
and you're the only one
who knows

42:48.225 --> 42:50.523
I'm not going back
to the hospital.

42:50.658 --> 42:52.864
<i>It's not like
I've picked a date.</i>

42:53.000 --> 42:55.902
I mean, you'll never
know it anyway.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.268
But... I'm ready to go.

43:01.006 --> 43:03.576
I would even say I'm impatient.

43:03.712 --> 43:05.405
I'm gonna be giving a lecture

43:05.540 --> 43:07.480
near Woodstock at Bard
in two weeks,

43:07.616 --> 43:08.947
so we can see each other.

43:09.083 --> 43:10.816
Mmm, I don't think
that's a good idea,

43:10.952 --> 43:12.814
I'll be with Martha
all the time.

43:12.950 --> 43:15.082
I'll call you if I can.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.787
You're going to need a lawyer.

43:16.922 --> 43:18.894
Yes, I should look for one.

43:19.030 --> 43:22.055
Let me help you with that,
but I'll have to fill them in.

43:22.191 --> 43:24.597
No, no, in that case, no.

43:24.732 --> 43:26.029
This is an absolute secret.

43:26.165 --> 43:27.803
Martha doesn't even know
I've told you.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.805
Okay. But if you need anything,
you should let me know.

43:32.672 --> 43:33.973
I worry about you.

43:34.937 --> 43:35.909
Thank you.

44:19.146 --> 44:20.723
[birds chirping]

44:34.130 --> 44:35.969
According to this map,

44:36.104 --> 44:38.370
we go up these stairs
to enter the house.

44:38.505 --> 44:39.599
Okay.

45:05.026 --> 45:06.197
[beeps]

45:06.996 --> 45:08.331
[whirring]

45:09.131 --> 45:10.234
Look at this.

45:25.482 --> 45:27.715
[Martha] Wow,
it's so beautiful.

45:27.850 --> 45:31.090
It's so much more beautiful
than in the photographs.

45:34.861 --> 45:36.655
Is that a real Hopper?

45:36.791 --> 45:38.559
I don't think they would
have left it here.

45:39.470 --> 45:41.236
It's a very good copy.

45:41.372 --> 45:42.864
It looks real.

45:42.999 --> 45:44.807
[birds chirping]

45:53.683 --> 45:55.785
[birds continue chirping]

46:05.762 --> 46:07.528
- Do you hear them?
- Mm-hmm.

46:07.663 --> 46:08.864
Isn't that wonderful?

46:13.565 --> 46:16.630
And we can lie in the sun,
like in the Hopper,

46:18.137 --> 46:20.469
and catch the evening breeze.

46:21.710 --> 46:23.241
[breathing heavily]

46:26.109 --> 46:27.245
Are you okay?

46:29.716 --> 46:30.710
Very happy.

46:48.596 --> 46:50.463
Do you mind if I take this one?

46:50.598 --> 46:52.369
Of course not. It's your house.

46:56.111 --> 46:58.106
Mmm. This one
is a little small,

46:58.242 --> 46:59.447
I'm gonna look downstairs.

46:59.583 --> 47:00.476
[Martha] All right.

47:18.362 --> 47:20.463
I'm gonna take this one, okay?

47:21.295 --> 47:24.039
Very good!

47:24.175 --> 47:27.475
You don't mind that
I'm not in the room next door?

47:27.611 --> 47:29.571
I can hear you breathe!

47:30.513 --> 47:32.479
And yell!

47:32.614 --> 47:34.675
[chuckles] Okay!

47:43.020 --> 47:44.960
Here we go.

47:48.896 --> 47:50.695
Let's get you unpacked.

47:50.830 --> 47:51.824
Thank you.

47:52.702 --> 47:54.495
I'll unpack it later.

47:54.631 --> 47:56.767
You're not
my caretaker, Ingrid.

47:56.902 --> 47:58.072
You're my guest.

47:58.837 --> 47:59.939
Okay.

48:00.074 --> 48:02.769
Um... I'll go unpack my things.

48:17.457 --> 48:19.891
- [objects clattering]
- [Martha shouts]

48:20.027 --> 48:21.590
- Martha?
- [Martha shouts]

48:24.995 --> 48:26.699
[shouts]

48:26.834 --> 48:28.968
What is it, honey?

48:29.104 --> 48:30.471
- You won't believe it.
- What?

48:30.606 --> 48:31.640
I forgot it!

48:31.775 --> 48:33.202
[stammers] You forgot what?

48:33.338 --> 48:34.835
The pill, the euthanasia pill!

48:34.970 --> 48:37.102
I brought all the others!
We have to go back.

48:37.238 --> 48:39.212
Oh, it's okay, we'll go back
first thing in the morning.

48:39.347 --> 48:40.548
- No, not tomorrow!
- Don't worry about it.

48:40.683 --> 48:42.012
We have to go now!

48:42.147 --> 48:43.412
I just need to be sure

48:43.548 --> 48:45.886
that I didn't lose it
or misplace it,

48:46.021 --> 48:47.957
that I didn't just dream it up.

48:48.821 --> 48:49.684
Okay.

48:55.596 --> 48:58.396
Buying another pill would be
extremely complicated.

48:59.570 --> 49:00.903
[sighs softly]

49:01.039 --> 49:04.332
I have a friend
who knows a mathematician

49:04.468 --> 49:06.404
who found it on the dark web.

49:07.744 --> 49:09.778
It's all very sordid,

49:09.913 --> 49:12.146
not to mention totally illegal.

49:15.377 --> 49:17.213
It's scary...

49:17.348 --> 49:19.283
knowing that all that exists

49:19.419 --> 49:21.617
just behind
our computer screens.

49:24.090 --> 49:25.522
I feel like a criminal.

49:30.562 --> 49:32.965
I never thought
I'd be back here again.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.197
With that wonderful skyline.

49:35.333 --> 49:37.563
Life always surprises you.

49:37.699 --> 49:39.633
All right, let's get to work.

49:39.768 --> 49:41.105
- Okay.
- I'll start in the kitchen.

49:41.240 --> 49:42.771
Don't worry, we'll find it.

49:42.906 --> 49:44.106
Just, um... Just try to think
of all the places

49:44.242 --> 49:45.641
you usually hide things.

49:45.776 --> 49:47.315
This is the first thing
I have ever hidden.

49:47.451 --> 49:49.175
Really?

49:49.310 --> 49:51.519
The only thing I can remember
is I put it in an envelope.

49:51.654 --> 49:53.119
Okay. Uh...

49:53.254 --> 49:54.857
Why don't I start
in your office?

49:54.993 --> 49:56.619
- Is that okay? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

49:56.754 --> 49:58.885
Where did I put it?
Where did I put it?

50:17.776 --> 50:20.148
Oh, my God. [sighs]
We're never gonna find it.

51:34.682 --> 51:35.784
I found an envelope.

51:36.693 --> 51:37.621
That's it!

51:38.521 --> 51:39.484
Where did you find it?

51:39.620 --> 51:41.053
In your desk.

51:41.188 --> 51:43.964
There was key in a drawer
and I opened it.

51:44.099 --> 51:46.031
How could I have forgotten?

51:46.167 --> 51:47.897
I even left the key in it?

51:48.033 --> 51:49.803
Well, you meant to take it,
at the last minute, you forgot.

51:49.938 --> 51:51.140
It's not so weird.

51:53.435 --> 51:54.638
Thank you.

51:55.704 --> 51:57.674
Such a strange sensation.

51:59.073 --> 52:00.913
It's like being here
after I'm dead.

52:01.049 --> 52:03.242
Oh, God, don't say that.

52:03.378 --> 52:05.847
It's too soon for you to
refer to yourself as a ghost.

52:07.455 --> 52:09.591
Let me straighten up
before we leave.

52:09.726 --> 52:10.819
Thank you.

53:02.637 --> 53:03.872
[door closes]

53:05.610 --> 53:07.815
Forgive me for all this hassle.

53:07.950 --> 53:09.146
I'm sorry, really.

53:09.281 --> 53:11.812
[sighs] It's okay.

53:11.948 --> 53:14.322
What a great place
to return to.

53:15.958 --> 53:17.858
Stupid fridge.

53:17.994 --> 53:19.294
You need some help?

53:22.128 --> 53:22.957
I got it.

53:30.203 --> 53:32.065
You know, maybe...

53:32.200 --> 53:34.771
leaving the pill behind
was a kind of a sign?

53:36.479 --> 53:38.379
Maybe you're not as ready
as you think.

53:40.911 --> 53:43.175
I told you never to say
that to me.

53:45.047 --> 53:46.651
I don't remember
you telling me that.

53:49.657 --> 53:51.590
I think I've said
so many things to you.

53:53.154 --> 53:56.762
That's the problem
with chemo brain.

53:56.898 --> 54:00.434
My memory keeps failing me
and I get distracted so easily.

54:02.671 --> 54:06.106
It can continue even
after the treatment stops

54:06.241 --> 54:07.903
and it can go on for years.

54:09.036 --> 54:10.807
I'll be spared that, at least.

54:13.674 --> 54:14.910
When I write...

54:16.116 --> 54:17.110
When I wrote...

54:19.081 --> 54:21.951
I had to proofread
a thousand times.

54:22.086 --> 54:24.383
I can't trust my judgement
about anything anymore.

54:24.519 --> 54:26.227
Well...

54:26.363 --> 54:29.693
Then why do you trust
this decision?

54:29.829 --> 54:32.026
How do you know
it's not chemo brain, too?

54:33.865 --> 54:35.761
I've left the pill
in the top drawer

54:35.896 --> 54:37.933
of the bedside table.

54:38.068 --> 54:41.007
If I forget,
which I don't think I will,

54:41.143 --> 54:43.235
you will remind me.

54:43.370 --> 54:46.579
And I prefer not to talk
about this anymore.

54:46.714 --> 54:49.483
Well, it's my business, too,
don't you think?

54:53.087 --> 54:54.488
Sure. Of course.

54:56.955 --> 54:59.252
I'll leave a signed letter
for the police

54:59.388 --> 55:02.589
telling them everything,
including the name of the pill

55:02.725 --> 55:04.199
and where I got it.

55:04.334 --> 55:08.426
Your name will not
appear anywhere.

55:08.562 --> 55:12.270
All you have to do is to say
that you know nothing.

55:12.405 --> 55:15.036
Don't budge from that.

55:15.172 --> 55:17.144
I don't wanna give you
any more information.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.776
The less you know, the better.

55:20.776 --> 55:22.582
And this is important.

55:28.225 --> 55:30.457
I'll sleep with my door open,

55:30.593 --> 55:33.492
and the day
that you find it closed...

55:33.628 --> 55:36.064
is the day
it's already happened.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.290
That's the sign, door closed.

55:44.272 --> 55:45.968
I know it's difficult.

55:48.808 --> 55:50.643
But just think
we're on vacation.

55:52.350 --> 55:56.208
You can write,
we can come and go...

55:56.344 --> 55:58.112
I don't think I'll
be able to concentrate.

56:00.451 --> 56:01.685
And if I write,

56:01.820 --> 56:02.947
you might show up
in it somewhere

56:03.083 --> 56:04.391
and I don't wanna do that.

56:04.527 --> 56:07.259
Yeah. That could
complicate your life

56:07.395 --> 56:09.162
if the police investigate.

56:09.298 --> 56:10.492
Well, I'm not gonna do it.

56:10.628 --> 56:11.864
Wait till I'm dead.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.095
Oh, God!

56:14.230 --> 56:17.736
Can you not say,
"Wait until I'm dead," please?

56:20.372 --> 56:21.443
I promise.

56:24.109 --> 56:25.544
I'd like to find a gym
somewhere around here

56:25.680 --> 56:27.240
that I can go to
a couple of days a week.

56:29.615 --> 56:30.747
I'm the only one who eats

56:30.882 --> 56:31.910
and I don't want
to gain ten pounds

56:32.045 --> 56:32.988
while you waste away.

56:33.123 --> 56:34.549
Oh, give me a chance.

56:34.685 --> 56:35.853
I'll catch up with you.

56:39.590 --> 56:40.891
Look, I'm eating.

56:43.229 --> 56:45.764
[Ingrid] <i>I have practically
held death in my hands.</i>

56:47.728 --> 56:50.703
<i>I never imagined it would be
something so light.</i>

57:26.877 --> 57:27.872
Martha?

57:29.342 --> 57:30.875
[water running]

57:32.347 --> 57:33.277
[Martha] Good morning.

57:33.413 --> 57:35.050
Good morning.

57:35.185 --> 57:36.309
I'm making breakfast.

57:37.616 --> 57:38.647
You want some toast?

57:38.782 --> 57:40.586
No, just some coffee.

57:40.722 --> 57:41.990
Help yourself.
It's already made.

57:42.126 --> 57:44.421
There's juice, fruit...

57:44.556 --> 57:45.791
whatever you want.

57:51.393 --> 57:54.635
My behavior yesterday
was unacceptable.

57:54.771 --> 57:58.772
I completely understand
that it drove you crazy.

57:58.907 --> 58:02.236
But in my current state,
I can't make any promises.

58:03.246 --> 58:04.403
So, just in case...

58:07.310 --> 58:10.614
I put a medium-range sedative
in this drawer.

58:10.750 --> 58:12.310
And if you find me unbearable,

58:12.446 --> 58:15.852
you just have one
and you can relax.

58:15.988 --> 58:17.321
I could have
used that last night.

58:17.456 --> 58:19.223
[laughs] You...

58:19.359 --> 58:22.161
You're one of a kind, Martha.
You really... You really are.

58:22.296 --> 58:23.826
[birds chirping]

58:23.961 --> 58:25.826
I've made a list
of stuff to buy.

58:25.961 --> 58:27.261
We need a few things.

58:28.804 --> 58:30.264
Is there anything
you want me to get?

58:31.569 --> 58:32.673
Don't think so.

58:34.106 --> 58:35.643
Do you wanna come
to the store with me?

58:37.642 --> 58:39.311
Maybe another day.

58:39.446 --> 58:41.911
It's so nice here.

58:42.046 --> 58:44.217
I'd like to stay
if you don't mind.

58:44.352 --> 58:45.686
No, of course not.

58:47.951 --> 58:50.915
I found a gym nearby, too.

58:51.051 --> 58:52.393
That's great.

58:52.529 --> 58:54.222
I think that's
a very good idea.

58:57.530 --> 59:00.063
Okay, well...

59:00.198 --> 59:02.395
I have my phone with me
if you need anything.

59:03.272 --> 59:04.463
Thanks, love.

59:10.981 --> 59:12.207
[sighs]

59:20.353 --> 59:21.588
Hi.

59:21.724 --> 59:22.915
I was hoping I could use
the gym today.

59:23.050 --> 59:24.383
Are you a member?

59:24.519 --> 59:25.891
Uh, no. I'm just in town
for a little bit.

59:26.026 --> 59:27.460
If you use one of our
personal trainers,

59:27.596 --> 59:29.059
you don't need to be a member.

59:29.195 --> 59:31.497
Um, okay. I'll use
one of your trainers then.

59:31.633 --> 59:33.228
You'll like Jonah, you'll see.

59:34.169 --> 59:35.704
Thanks.

59:35.839 --> 59:37.996
So, would you like to start
a warm up doing steps?

59:38.132 --> 59:39.773
- Okay.
- Is okay?

59:39.908 --> 59:42.943
Do you think you can do this
for 30 seconds?

59:43.078 --> 59:45.713
- Um, sure. All right.
- Okay, go for it. Have a try.

59:46.779 --> 59:49.242
And we are on. Okay, nice.

59:49.377 --> 59:50.616
- Keep focus on your leg.
- Mmm-hmm.

59:50.751 --> 59:52.244
And, if you can,
move your arm...

59:52.380 --> 59:53.721
- Okay.
- Okay, with each step.

59:54.949 --> 59:56.658
And we are done.

59:56.793 --> 59:59.624
Nice. You're pretty strong,
you young lady.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.456
[panting] What I am is winded.

01:00:01.592 --> 01:00:04.129
Well, if you want, there are
other variations we can do.

01:00:04.265 --> 01:00:05.533
[pants]

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:07.367
I mean, you can go try
like this.

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.097
You can go back and forth.

01:00:09.233 --> 01:00:12.100
Or you can jump on it
and go left

01:00:12.235 --> 01:00:14.905
and right or back
and on the box.

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:16.673
- Okay. Okay.
- Have a try one more.

01:00:16.809 --> 01:00:19.910
- [panting]
- Nice.

01:00:20.046 --> 01:00:21.306
- Focus on your core here.
- Uh-huh.

01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:24.119
And breathe. [breathing deeply]

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:26.082
Inhale and exhale.

01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:28.585
- [panting]
- [Jonah breathing deeply]

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.750
Perfect. One more.

01:00:29.885 --> 01:00:31.385
[panting]

01:00:33.957 --> 01:00:34.993
Is everything okay?

01:00:35.726 --> 01:00:37.391
[panting]

01:00:40.365 --> 01:00:43.100
When the body's in great shape,
it takes longer to die.

01:00:45.638 --> 01:00:47.270
When death comes,

01:00:47.406 --> 01:00:50.479
the mind wants to go,
but the body keeps fighting.

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:53.341
Heart beating "no"
with every beat.

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.541
Well...

01:00:55.676 --> 01:00:58.685
all the more reason
to look after yourself.

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.121
I live with a friend
who's dying.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.283
I'm sorry.

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.319
Come. Let's have a seat.

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:05.925
Come here.

01:01:08.155 --> 01:01:10.157
[sighs, sniffles]

01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:12.195
Is there anything
that I can do?

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:16.672
[sighs]

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:20.907
I wish I could give you a hug,

01:01:21.042 --> 01:01:23.006
but we're not allowed
to touch clients anymore

01:01:23.142 --> 01:01:25.373
because of the lawsuits
and whatever.

01:01:28.682 --> 01:01:31.017
And it's a problem,

01:01:31.152 --> 01:01:32.879
because it can be hard
to correct people's posture

01:01:33.014 --> 01:01:34.785
with just words,

01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:36.725
and touching is so important.

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:40.551
This world
is absurd and inhumane.

01:01:40.687 --> 01:01:42.995
I don't see it improving
any time soon.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.564
But thank you, I feel hugged.

01:01:47.699 --> 01:01:48.869
[chuckles]

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:57.736
Oh, I've been meaning
to read this book.

01:01:57.871 --> 01:02:00.611
Isn't it a wonderful title?
<i>Erotic Vagrancy.</i>

01:02:00.747 --> 01:02:01.849
Do you wanna buy it?

01:02:04.049 --> 01:02:05.754
I won't have time to finish it.

01:02:12.652 --> 01:02:14.558
I like the way
it's laid out here.

01:02:14.694 --> 01:02:15.658
[Ingrid] Mmm.

01:02:15.793 --> 01:02:17.264
Oh, look.

01:02:17.399 --> 01:02:18.657
Martha Gellhorn.

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.198
<i>The View from the Ground.</i>

01:02:23.699 --> 01:02:27.906
She wrote that you only ever
truly love one war,

01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:29.976
after that you're just
doing your duty.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.606
Which one was yours?

01:02:35.276 --> 01:02:37.214
Bosnia, without a doubt.

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:45.727
The fight to survive
by the Bosnian people

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:48.760
against a perfectly
equipped army...

01:02:48.896 --> 01:02:50.390
stole the hearts of all of us

01:02:50.526 --> 01:02:52.933
who witnessed
the extermination.

01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:55.969
There are very few women
war correspondents.

01:02:57.199 --> 01:02:59.631
War is a man's thing.

01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:01.841
You have to sort of become
one of the guys

01:03:01.977 --> 01:03:03.808
and it was never
a problem for me,

01:03:03.944 --> 01:03:06.112
I've always lived like a man.

01:03:06.247 --> 01:03:11.083
Actually, I think
what Michelle really missed...

01:03:11.218 --> 01:03:13.745
was having a maternal figure
in her life.

01:03:14.723 --> 01:03:17.887
And in this, I must admit

01:03:18.022 --> 01:03:19.923
she... she was right.

01:03:20.059 --> 01:03:21.588
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:29.261
Hey, look who's coming to town!

01:03:29.396 --> 01:03:31.263
The life of the party!

01:03:31.399 --> 01:03:33.271
<i>"How bad can it get?</i>

01:03:33.406 --> 01:03:35.167
<i>Navigating urban life
with integrity."</i>

01:03:35.303 --> 01:03:36.669
You feel like going?

01:03:36.804 --> 01:03:38.176
No, you know what?
I've heard it already

01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:40.079
and it's not an evening
I'd like to repeat.

01:03:40.214 --> 01:03:42.476
We all have our own
personal apocalypses.

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:44.312
Are you having
an awful time with me?

01:03:44.448 --> 01:03:47.016
No, no, I meant him,
his lecture.

01:03:47.152 --> 01:03:48.915
Global crisis, climate change.

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:49.924
Yeah.

01:03:50.425 --> 01:03:51.524
Hi.

01:03:51.659 --> 01:03:52.685
I love your hair.

01:03:53.395 --> 01:03:54.357
Nice.

01:04:05.469 --> 01:04:08.468
When the nightmares
come rushing in,

01:04:08.604 --> 01:04:11.106
I think about
all the men I've loved.

01:04:11.242 --> 01:04:12.678
[chuckles] Sounds like a song.

01:04:12.813 --> 01:04:14.612
[chuckles] A good one.

01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:15.774
[both chuckle]

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.118
Even if it was
just for one night.

01:04:20.518 --> 01:04:23.320
[sighs] Sometimes I think
about Damian.

01:04:28.393 --> 01:04:30.590
I still think
sex is the best way

01:04:30.726 --> 01:04:32.824
to fend off looming thoughts
of death.

01:04:34.397 --> 01:04:36.498
Like those Spanish Carmelites.

01:04:38.537 --> 01:04:41.342
Wars turned me into
a promiscuous woman, Ingrid.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:42.834
Good. [laughs]

01:04:44.838 --> 01:04:46.173
Are you still
in touch with him?

01:04:46.308 --> 01:04:48.411
- With who?
- Damian.

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:51.148
Um...

01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:52.679
You know...
Um, from time to time.

01:04:55.286 --> 01:04:57.849
"How bad can it get?" [scoffs]

01:04:59.693 --> 01:05:01.457
Well... [sighs]

01:05:01.592 --> 01:05:04.757
much worse than you imagine,
Damian, honey.

01:05:08.503 --> 01:05:09.465
Hey.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:11.566
You all right?

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:13.942
I was trying to write.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:16.406
I can't.

01:05:19.545 --> 01:05:23.715
In this war, I'm incapable
of writing anything.

01:05:23.851 --> 01:05:24.876
What about reading?

01:05:26.182 --> 01:05:27.186
You love to read.

01:05:27.919 --> 01:05:29.089
I've tried.

01:05:30.918 --> 01:05:33.291
I've tried with some
of my favorite writers.

01:05:35.526 --> 01:05:37.966
The spell just isn't
there anymore.

01:05:40.737 --> 01:05:42.498
I'm talking about Faulkner,

01:05:43.935 --> 01:05:45.039
Hemingway...

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.372
I can't concentrate.

01:05:49.936 --> 01:05:53.278
My mind just flies off
into the void.

01:05:54.574 --> 01:05:56.116
If you're too tired,

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:58.646
I could read to you.

01:06:01.756 --> 01:06:02.914
Not just reading,

01:06:04.321 --> 01:06:06.291
all pleasure's been reduced.

01:06:08.895 --> 01:06:10.128
It's hard to know

01:06:10.264 --> 01:06:12.462
what to pay attention
to anymore.

01:06:15.595 --> 01:06:16.928
I have very little time

01:06:18.072 --> 01:06:19.403
and I don't want to waste it.

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.011
Okay. Um...

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.875
What about music?

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.618
I can only listen
to the birds singing.

01:06:35.754 --> 01:06:38.856
Well, luckily, they give us
a serenade every day.

01:06:38.992 --> 01:06:42.020
Music decenters me.

01:06:42.156 --> 01:06:44.963
It comes between me
and whatever it is I'm doing,

01:06:45.098 --> 01:06:46.628
even if it's just thinking.

01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:51.197
Maybe the chemo
is affecting my hearing.

01:06:51.332 --> 01:06:53.635
Oh, honey.

01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:56.671
I've been reduced
to very little of myself.

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:08.221
I long for some peace
of body and mind.

01:07:11.019 --> 01:07:14.161
And to just talk whenever
I'm invaded by memory.

01:07:15.391 --> 01:07:16.623
Am I talking too much?

01:07:16.758 --> 01:07:18.731
No, no, no, no.
Talk all you want,

01:07:18.867 --> 01:07:20.326
I love listening to you.

01:07:20.462 --> 01:07:22.169

[continues sobbing]

01:10:05.196 --> 01:10:06.999
What's going on?

01:10:07.135 --> 01:10:08.698
- What's wrong?
- [gasps]

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:13.637
Your door was closed,
so I thought you...

01:10:15.174 --> 01:10:17.536
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:18.904
I opened a window

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.748
and the breeze
must have closed it.

01:10:21.883 --> 01:10:23.009
Oh, my God!

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:25.748
[sniffling]

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.023
Do you think it's fair
to be mad at me

01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:33.756
because I'm still alive?

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.091
Think of it as a rehearsal.

01:10:40.697 --> 01:10:42.435
Now you know how it's gonna be.

01:10:43.733 --> 01:10:45.471
You know how you're gonna feel.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.408
You're gonna have
to make some calls

01:10:49.544 --> 01:10:52.980
and act out all the things
we talked about.

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:54.942
And you never knew anything...

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:57.246
and we were on vacation...

01:10:57.381 --> 01:10:59.078
Please, just stop!

01:11:00.888 --> 01:11:02.054
Okay.

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:03.588

Should we call it a night?

01:12:14.159 --> 01:12:15.694
Oh!

01:12:15.829 --> 01:12:18.091
Or does the young lady
wanna keep watching movies?

01:12:19.765 --> 01:12:22.667
Did you tell me
that they have <i>The Dead?</i>

01:12:23.897 --> 01:12:25.004
Or did I dream that?

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.105
Yeah, they have it.

01:12:27.241 --> 01:12:29.201
Um, you wanna watch it?

01:12:30.011 --> 01:12:31.109
Yes, please.

01:12:31.245 --> 01:12:32.644
[Ingrid] Here we go.

01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:36.351
Here we go.

- Okay.

01:14:36.403 --> 01:14:37.669
I think I need to sit.

All right. Yeah, let's go
sit over here.

- Oh, that's much better.
- Oh, good.

01:15:02.863 --> 01:15:05.961
Before coming here,
I made a new will.

Aw, let's not talk
about this now, please.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.402
I'm leaving the apartment
and everything in it

01:15:12.538 --> 01:15:14.168
to Michelle and you.

01:15:19.946 --> 01:15:23.110
I found your war journals
in your desk.

01:15:23.245 --> 01:15:25.614
What do you want us
to do with them?

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:27.485
Is it okay if I read them?

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.018
Of course you can read them.

01:15:32.492 --> 01:15:34.161
Can I tell your story?

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:35.563
You can do what you want.

01:15:36.626 --> 01:15:37.895
I won't be here.

01:15:39.992 --> 01:15:41.030
Can I say that?

01:15:41.663 --> 01:15:42.669
No.

01:15:43.863 --> 01:15:44.869
Okay.

about this now, okay?

01:16:42.092 --> 01:16:44.599
All right,
I'll see you there. Bye.

<i>Today is such a beautiful day
that it seemed to me it...</i>

01:16:59.873 --> 01:17:00.747
Hey.

Hi.

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:04.350
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:06.443
This breeze is delicious.

01:17:06.579 --> 01:17:08.755
Be careful,
it's a little chilly.

01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:11.692
Um...

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:13.624
If you don't need me,
I'm gonna go to the gym.

01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.157
But I can stay if you want.

01:17:15.292 --> 01:17:17.461
No. Please, go.
I don't want to be a downer.

01:17:17.597 --> 01:17:18.862
You're not a downer.

01:17:18.998 --> 01:17:21.327
You've been
pretty well-behaved.

01:17:21.463 --> 01:17:23.803
Have you talked
to your trainer about me?

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:26.340
Um...

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:29.270
Well... I mean, it came up.

01:17:29.405 --> 01:17:31.677
I was talking about
being in good shape

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:34.674
and the heart beating
to survive.

01:17:34.809 --> 01:17:37.817
You know, everything that you
talked about in the hospital

01:17:37.952 --> 01:17:40.083
and he looked at me
like I was a lunatic,

01:17:40.218 --> 01:17:42.617
so I told him I had
a friend that was sick.

01:17:42.752 --> 01:17:44.858
That's all.

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:49.756
Just remember,
you know nothing
about anything.

01:17:49.891 --> 01:17:50.929
[Ingrid] Mm.

01:17:55.262 --> 01:17:56.968
Come here, give me a kiss.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.906
- You okay?
- Yes.

01:18:13.552 --> 01:18:15.547
[lively chatter]

01:18:23.893 --> 01:18:25.161
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:30.364 --> 01:18:32.703
I lied to her, I don't like it.

01:18:32.839 --> 01:18:34.074
Well, you'll have to practice.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.999
Lying?

01:18:36.135 --> 01:18:39.376
Yes. Officially,
you aren't aware
of Martha's intentions.

01:18:39.511 --> 01:18:40.979
Yeah.

01:18:41.115 --> 01:18:43.014
And I found a lawyer,
in case you need one.

01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:45.145
Thank you. Let's not
talk about this now.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.220
- Mm.
- How'd your lecture go?

01:18:48.355 --> 01:18:51.891
Well, they weren't too happy
about my not taking questions.

01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:55.721
In the end,

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:58.860
people started muttering
and someone called me a coward.

01:18:58.995 --> 01:19:00.631
It doesn't bother me.

01:19:00.767 --> 01:19:02.770
I spent way too much time

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:05.602
caring about my reputation,
and for what?

01:19:05.737 --> 01:19:07.971
So, what are you doing
with all that time
you've gotten back?

01:19:08.107 --> 01:19:11.745
Are you doing more
of what you love?

01:19:11.881 --> 01:19:14.274
I have to admit
that my interest in things

01:19:14.409 --> 01:19:16.784
has been shrinking
as I get older.

01:19:18.515 --> 01:19:20.647
Martha said the same thing
a couple days ago.

01:19:20.783 --> 01:19:23.247
There are so few things left
that she can really enjoy.

01:19:23.383 --> 01:19:25.155
- I understand.
- Mm.

01:19:26.385 --> 01:19:28.128
But you're not sick.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:30.127
No, but I feel the same way,
especially after the pandemic.

01:19:30.262 --> 01:19:32.558
I don't go to the cinema
or listen to music.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.065
I... I read a lot,

01:19:35.201 --> 01:19:37.070
but only subjects
to do with my lectures.

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:39.565
Mm. You still go to galleries?
You used to love that.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.136
When we were together,
we'd go all the time

01:19:41.272 --> 01:19:43.376
and talk about
how powerful the art is.

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.573
You still like that?

01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:48.311
Even if every poet in the world
sat down to write a poem

01:19:48.446 --> 01:19:50.818
about the climate crisis,
it wouldn't save one tree.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.981
At least you're still
interested in trees.

01:19:53.116 --> 01:19:54.720
I'm interested in sex, too.

01:19:54.855 --> 01:19:56.455
Well, then you're not that bad.

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:58.950
When I was young,

01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:02.955
if a day went by without sex,
I thought it was incomplete.

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.990
I remember that.

01:20:05.126 --> 01:20:09.331
I'm not nostalgic,
but I miss the nights
when we'd drink...

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:12.966
and take drugs, have sex,

01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:16.004
all that didn't distract us
from what we really
wanted to do.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.502
You drank and you took drugs.

01:20:18.637 --> 01:20:20.439
I mean, more than I did anyway.

01:20:20.575 --> 01:20:22.514
I don't know
how much you drank,

01:20:22.649 --> 01:20:26.018
but you always acted
as you were as blitzed
as the rest of us.

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:29.149
But you were an essential part
of the party.

01:20:29.284 --> 01:20:30.955
That is, until you got bored

01:20:31.091 --> 01:20:32.783
and went off
to discover Europe.

01:20:34.256 --> 01:20:35.489
You want to talk about that?

01:20:36.797 --> 01:20:37.790
Tell me about your lecture.

01:20:37.926 --> 01:20:39.428
[sighs]

01:20:39.563 --> 01:20:43.627
I admit that I've become
something of a monomaniac.

01:20:43.762 --> 01:20:45.631
My own son is no longer
speaking to me

01:20:45.766 --> 01:20:48.007
because I didn't hide
how appalled I was

01:20:48.142 --> 01:20:50.667
that his wife
is expecting another child.

01:20:50.803 --> 01:20:51.976
He doesn't want me
anywhere near her

01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:54.040
for fear
she'll have a miscarriage.

01:20:54.175 --> 01:20:56.180
What? How could you tell him
that he can't have
another child?

01:20:56.315 --> 01:20:58.611
- It's their third!
- [stammering] What...

01:20:58.746 --> 01:21:00.777
So, what's the next
logical alternative?

01:21:00.913 --> 01:21:02.218
For people
to start killing themselves?

01:21:02.354 --> 01:21:04.520
People should be aware,
once and for all,

01:21:04.656 --> 01:21:06.817
of the state of the fucking
planet they're living on.

01:21:08.824 --> 01:21:11.755
Well, perhaps this isn't
the best subject for you.

01:21:11.891 --> 01:21:15.535
You're living with
a dying woman in a world

01:21:15.671 --> 01:21:17.872
also in its death throes.

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:22.904
Do you really think
the situation
is that desperate?

01:21:23.039 --> 01:21:27.444
Yes. Read the science
and see what the world
is doing with it.

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:31.549
They're releasing more CO2
into the air than ever before.

01:21:31.684 --> 01:21:33.484
Sooner or later,

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:38.388
and I fear it will be sooner,
all this will be shot to hell.

01:21:38.523 --> 01:21:42.028
Nothing is going to hasten
the end of the planet

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:45.060
more than the survival
of neo-liberalism

01:21:45.196 --> 01:21:46.826
and the rise of the far right.

01:21:46.961 --> 01:21:50.729
And we have both of them here,
marching side by side.

01:21:54.066 --> 01:21:57.208
Sorry, I didn't want
to bring you down, but...

01:21:58.505 --> 01:22:00.511
I get riled up with this.

01:22:00.647 --> 01:22:04.010
You cannot go around
telling people that
there's no hope.

01:22:04.145 --> 01:22:05.712
It's tragic.

01:22:05.848 --> 01:22:08.380
And maybe it's really
unpleasant of me to say so,

01:22:08.516 --> 01:22:10.724
but I've completely lost faith

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.888
in people doing
the right thing.

01:22:13.024 --> 01:22:15.461
I'm living every day
expecting to find
Martha's body in her bed,

01:22:15.596 --> 01:22:19.466
but that doesn't stop me
from enjoying every minute
with her,

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.562
just the opposite.

01:22:21.697 --> 01:22:24.963
I'm learning from her
and you should, too,

01:22:25.099 --> 01:22:28.008
because there are lots of ways
to live inside a tragedy.

01:22:29.909 --> 01:22:32.446
Of course it's painful,

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:34.608
but I can take it.

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.883
And I'm trying to live

01:22:38.018 --> 01:22:40.580
with the same joy that she has,

01:22:40.716 --> 01:22:43.551
and with the same
appreciation, so...

01:22:43.686 --> 01:22:46.387
the last thing I need
is a speech like yours.

01:22:46.522 --> 01:22:47.995
I've always admired you
for that.

01:22:49.354 --> 01:22:50.955
What?

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:53.297
You're one of the only people
who knows how to suffer

01:22:53.433 --> 01:22:56.003
without making others
feel guilty about it.

01:23:23.993 --> 01:23:24.999
[sighs]

01:23:38.311 --> 01:23:40.539
Do you think
it will be much longer?

01:23:40.674 --> 01:23:43.941
No, it'll be soon. Any day now.

01:23:45.248 --> 01:23:47.048
You have to be prepared.

01:23:47.183 --> 01:23:48.515
I know the police.

01:23:48.651 --> 01:23:50.390
They'll ask you
all sorts of questions,

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:53.288
they'll dig into
your relationship
like scavengers.

01:23:53.423 --> 01:23:55.126
You need
a kind of mental script.

01:23:55.262 --> 01:23:57.998
No, I thought about it,
I do have it.

01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:00.996
Good. Stay strong
and stick to your story.

01:24:01.132 --> 01:24:02.631
And when it happens,

01:24:02.766 --> 01:24:05.202
you should call the police
before you call me.

01:24:05.338 --> 01:24:06.533
No, I need to call
her daughter.

01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:08.141
I should call her
before I call you.

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:10.605
Okay, but be careful
what you say to her.

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.338
I had to tell the lawyer
about the situation.

01:24:13.473 --> 01:24:16.742
Why do we have to
go through all this,
like we're criminals?

01:24:16.877 --> 01:24:18.347
Shouldn't dying people
have the right

01:24:18.483 --> 01:24:19.878
to end their lives
with dignity?

01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:22.282
They will, once
our teetering health system

01:24:22.417 --> 01:24:23.882
completely collapses.

01:24:24.758 --> 01:24:26.720
[birds chirping]

01:25:01.057 --> 01:25:02.096
Martha?

01:25:22.643 --> 01:25:24.478
[Martha] <i>Dear Ingrid,</i>

01:25:24.613 --> 01:25:27.310
<i>today is such a beautiful day</i>

01:25:27.446 --> 01:25:30.786
<i>that it seemed to me
it was the moment to leave.</i>

01:25:30.922 --> 01:25:34.519
<i>It consoled me that you weren't
in the room downstairs,</i>

01:25:34.655 --> 01:25:36.863
<i>even though that was the idea.</i>

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:40.493
<i>But you know I always improvise</i>

01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:42.366
<i>and I'm almost happy that,</i>

01:25:42.502 --> 01:25:45.564
<i>while I fade away
on the lounger,</i>

01:25:45.699 --> 01:25:47.438
<i>you're out in the world,</i>

01:25:47.574 --> 01:25:51.510
<i>experiencing something
different to my death.</i>

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:54.841
<i>No one will be able
to accuse you of complicity.</i>

01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:57.780
<i>You have accompanied me</i>

01:25:57.915 --> 01:26:02.486
<i>as much as any human being
can accompany another.</i>

01:26:02.622 --> 01:26:05.588
<i>Call my daughter
and tell her I'm sorry.</i>

01:26:06.896 --> 01:26:09.295
<i>And thank you, love.</i>

01:26:34.953 --> 01:26:35.981
Martha.

01:26:39.654 --> 01:26:41.228
I'll do whatever you want.

01:26:46.427 --> 01:26:47.531
[sniffling]

01:27:00.981 --> 01:27:02.975
[birds cawing]

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:11.417
We had dinner
and then we watched
a Buster Keaton movie.

01:27:11.553 --> 01:27:12.919
I told you this already.

01:27:13.054 --> 01:27:15.095
And you didn't notice
anything strange,

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:17.363
anything that made
you suspect...

01:27:19.933 --> 01:27:21.301
Try to remember.

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.929
I remember it perfectly,
it was a fun night.

01:27:24.065 --> 01:27:26.701
There were no gestures?
Nothing she said?

01:27:26.837 --> 01:27:29.604
We said goodnight
and then I went upstairs

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:32.203
and I stayed up late
reading a book

01:27:32.339 --> 01:27:34.909
that Martha had recommended
called <i>Erotic Vagrancy.</i>

01:27:35.044 --> 01:27:37.741
It's about Elizabeth Taylor
and Richard Burton.

01:27:37.877 --> 01:27:39.386
- Do you know it?
- No.

01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:41.948
Martha and I both thought
that it was really fun.

01:27:42.084 --> 01:27:44.324
Try to answer
only the questions I ask you.

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.758
What'd you do
the following morning?

01:27:52.199 --> 01:27:54.257
I had lunch with a friend.

01:27:54.392 --> 01:27:56.464
And when I came back,
I called out for her

01:27:56.599 --> 01:27:58.267
and when she didn't answer,

01:27:58.402 --> 01:28:00.137
I went to her bedroom.

01:28:00.272 --> 01:28:02.201
But she wasn't there.

01:28:02.337 --> 01:28:06.373
So I went into the backyard
and that's when I saw her.

01:28:06.508 --> 01:28:09.274
And, at first, I thought
that she was asleep
on the lounge chair

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:12.217
and I got really nervous
and I called the ambulance.

01:28:12.352 --> 01:28:13.711
And they got there very quickly

01:28:13.847 --> 01:28:15.722
and then the EMTs saw her

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:18.455
and then they said
there was nothing
that they could do.

01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:20.352
Nobody buys this pill
by accident

01:28:20.487 --> 01:28:22.692
if they're
not thinking of suicide
or killing someone,

01:28:22.827 --> 01:28:24.423
so, you didn't know
anything about this?

01:28:24.558 --> 01:28:26.258
About what?

01:28:26.394 --> 01:28:28.027
About her being in possession
of this illegal compound.

01:28:28.163 --> 01:28:31.634
No. She was taking medication
for the pain,

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:33.602
you know, patches and pills,
but she...

01:28:33.738 --> 01:28:35.837
she never shared
the specifics with me.

01:28:36.935 --> 01:28:38.640
It is strange that,

01:28:38.775 --> 01:28:40.137
if you two
were such good friends,

01:28:40.272 --> 01:28:43.375
that she didn't say
anything to you.

01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:48.014
You can't just
walk into a drugstore
and buy this pill.

01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:50.621
It's very difficult to come by.

01:28:52.052 --> 01:28:55.121
I think when she rented
the house,

01:28:55.256 --> 01:28:57.830
she already knew what she was
gonna do, right?

01:28:57.966 --> 01:28:59.759
It's possible,

01:28:59.895 --> 01:29:02.302
but she didn't
tell me anything.

01:29:02.438 --> 01:29:04.262
She was exhausted
from the last treatment

01:29:04.397 --> 01:29:05.962
and she wanted to take a break
before going back

01:29:06.097 --> 01:29:08.100
for the next round of chemo.

01:29:08.235 --> 01:29:09.975
She wasn't the type
to throw in the towel.

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:12.037
She didn't complain?

01:29:12.173 --> 01:29:14.645
She didn't say anything
that made you sense...

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.812
the end?

01:29:17.948 --> 01:29:19.177
It was a great responsibility
for you.

01:29:20.617 --> 01:29:22.180
She complained sometimes.

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:29.152
What did she complain about?
What did she say?

01:29:29.287 --> 01:29:32.531
She'd lost the capacity
for attention.

01:29:32.666 --> 01:29:36.667
She couldn't read or write,
for example.

01:29:38.572 --> 01:29:40.165
Her life was reduced
to surviving.

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.567
You know, I find it
very hard to believe

01:29:43.702 --> 01:29:46.039
that she didn't say anything
that made you suspect the end.

01:29:46.175 --> 01:29:48.446
It was more than evident
that she was very sick,

01:29:48.581 --> 01:29:50.041
but she wanted to
take a vacation

01:29:50.177 --> 01:29:51.181
before going back
to the hospital.

01:29:51.317 --> 01:29:53.718
I told you this already.

01:29:53.853 --> 01:29:59.217
So, we also spoke to some
of Martha's close friends.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.156
In general, they all coincide
with your testimony.

01:30:06.191 --> 01:30:08.866
But one of them, Stella Byrne,

01:30:09.001 --> 01:30:11.438
told us that, after Martha
finished her chemotherapy,

01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:14.403
that she proposed
that she accompany her

01:30:14.539 --> 01:30:16.871
to a house in the country

01:30:17.006 --> 01:30:19.908
where she intended
to commit suicide.

01:30:23.944 --> 01:30:26.079
Asked her to, and I quote...

01:30:27.552 --> 01:30:28.752
"Be in the room next door."

01:30:32.292 --> 01:30:34.585
And her friend refused.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.591
I wasn't in the room next door,
I was in the room downstairs.

01:30:37.727 --> 01:30:39.122
When I spoke to Mrs. Byrne

01:30:39.258 --> 01:30:40.498
and informed her
of the suicide,

01:30:40.634 --> 01:30:42.595
she told me
she wasn't surprised.

01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:45.336
There's another word
for what Martha did,
it's called euthanasia.

01:30:45.471 --> 01:30:46.968
Well, call it what you want,

01:30:47.103 --> 01:30:50.674
but, for me, what your friend
did is a crime

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:53.837
and, as a policeman,
as a human being,

01:30:53.972 --> 01:30:56.375
as a man of faith,

01:30:56.510 --> 01:31:00.312
I'm radically opposed
to anyone committing a crime.

01:31:00.448 --> 01:31:02.489
And, of course, anyone aiding
and abetting in one.

01:31:09.593 --> 01:31:11.421
[cell phone clicking]

01:31:12.925 --> 01:31:15.328
[line ringing]

01:31:15.464 --> 01:31:17.768
Damian, can you come down
to the police station, please?

01:31:18.534 --> 01:31:19.835
This is endless.

01:31:19.971 --> 01:31:23.001
How do you explain
that your friend Martha

01:31:23.136 --> 01:31:24.910
was so explicit with Mrs. Byrne

01:31:25.045 --> 01:31:27.170
and yet she didn't tell you
anything about her intentions?

01:31:27.305 --> 01:31:28.813
I'm not gonna say another word.

01:31:28.948 --> 01:31:31.178
If I'm under arrest,
then tell me the charges.

01:31:31.313 --> 01:31:33.217
Otherwise, I'll wait
in the hall for my lawyer.

01:31:33.353 --> 01:31:34.719
Very foresighted of you.

01:31:34.854 --> 01:31:36.681
What made you think
you'd need a lawyer?

01:31:36.816 --> 01:31:39.951
Why don't you ask your friend,
he witnessed the interrogation.

01:31:40.087 --> 01:31:44.160
[sighs] I think you're lying.

01:31:44.295 --> 01:31:46.325
And that you're
the kind of person
who wouldn't say no

01:31:46.461 --> 01:31:48.964
if a friend asked you
for help committing suicide.

01:31:51.501 --> 01:31:52.563
Let her go.

01:31:52.699 --> 01:31:53.540
[buzzes]

01:32:01.675 --> 01:32:03.148
Hey.

01:32:03.283 --> 01:32:04.680
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32:04.815 --> 01:32:07.219
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.148
This is my lawyer, Sarah.

01:32:09.283 --> 01:32:10.984
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Thank you for coming.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.726
Of course.
Damian's filled me in.

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:14.825
Is there anything I should know
about the interrogation?

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.728
Well, he treated me
like I was the killer.

01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:18.562
- But you were with me.
- He doesn't care.

01:32:18.697 --> 01:32:20.032
He insists that I'm implicated.

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:21.535
Okay, but...

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.669
He spoke to a friend
of Martha, Stella Byrne,

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:25.700
who said that Martha
had approached her first

01:32:25.835 --> 01:32:27.200
and she refused to help her.

01:32:27.335 --> 01:32:29.165
Okay, well, I'm sure
everything was recorded.

01:32:29.301 --> 01:32:30.875
- Mm-hmm.
- [door opens]

01:32:31.011 --> 01:32:33.739
Um, and this police officer
witnessed everything.

01:32:33.875 --> 01:32:35.174
You can come in now.

01:32:35.309 --> 01:32:36.781
I'll go in alone.
I'm her attorney.

01:32:38.752 --> 01:32:40.411
Don't worry,
this is all very clear.

01:32:42.752 --> 01:32:43.884
Thank you for coming.

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.685
- My pleasure.
- [door buzzes]

01:32:45.821 --> 01:32:47.956
Jesus! What an asshole!

01:32:48.092 --> 01:32:50.623
I've never been treated
like that before.

01:32:50.759 --> 01:32:53.191
You were unlucky enough
to come up against
a religious fanatic,

01:32:53.327 --> 01:32:54.597
but he's not gonna
bother you again.

01:32:54.732 --> 01:32:55.897
I'm gonna file a complaint.

01:32:56.032 --> 01:32:58.101
Thank you so much
for everything.

01:32:58.236 --> 01:33:00.232
You still need to be available
for the next 48 hours

01:33:00.367 --> 01:33:03.071
until forensic formalities
are done.

01:33:03.206 --> 01:33:05.211
Um, I told them to call me
if necessary.

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:06.745
I'll be at the house.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:07.774
Do you have
all the information you need?

01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:09.749
Yes, Damian gave it to me.

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:11.946
Just give me a call
if anything comes up, okay?

01:33:12.081 --> 01:33:13.617
I'm gonna head back
to the office.

01:33:13.752 --> 01:33:14.915
I'm really sorry for your loss.

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:16.284
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Sarah.

01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:18.216
Bye.

01:33:18.352 --> 01:33:20.085
I can't believe
Stella told him that.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.794
Well, he probably cornered her,

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.722
and they have Martha's computer
and her cell phone.

01:33:23.857 --> 01:33:24.858
[Ingrid] Mm.

01:33:24.993 --> 01:33:26.458
Do you know if they talked?

01:33:26.593 --> 01:33:28.899
No, I don't know,
she didn't tell me anything.

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:31.795
What do you wanna do?

01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:33.997
I need to go back to the house
and pack up Martha's things.

01:33:34.133 --> 01:33:35.106
[cell phone ringing]

01:33:35.241 --> 01:33:36.104
Sorry.

01:33:37.606 --> 01:33:39.111
Hello?

01:33:39.247 --> 01:33:40.471
Uh, speaking.

01:33:42.582 --> 01:33:43.842
[whispers] It's Michelle.

01:33:43.977 --> 01:33:45.146
Martha's daughter?

01:33:45.978 --> 01:33:47.179
Yes, of course.

01:33:47.315 --> 01:33:49.317
No, no, of course
you can come over.

01:33:49.453 --> 01:33:52.692
I'm headed there right now.
I'll text you the address.

01:33:54.089 --> 01:33:56.157
Okay, I'll see you soon. Bye.

01:33:58.166 --> 01:34:00.828
Wow. Wow.

01:34:00.963 --> 01:34:02.893
I'm headed back to the city,

01:34:03.029 --> 01:34:05.837
so tell me when you're back
and I'll help you
with your move.

01:34:07.035 --> 01:34:08.939
Thank you for everything.

01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:14.010
And you can tell me
how it went with Michelle.

01:34:14.643 --> 01:34:15.506
I will.

01:34:17.545 --> 01:34:19.752
- Thanks. I'll call you, okay?
- Okay. Take care.

01:34:21.816 --> 01:34:23.822
[birds chirping]

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:54.688
Hello, I'm Michelle.

01:34:55.553 --> 01:34:56.547
I'm Ingrid.

01:34:57.686 --> 01:34:58.516
Hi.

01:35:02.124 --> 01:35:04.698
- Let's go inside, okay?
- Yeah.

01:35:07.994 --> 01:35:08.999
Come on in.

01:35:15.205 --> 01:35:16.868
Do you wanna see
your mother's room?

01:35:17.003 --> 01:35:18.635
Yes, please.

01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:20.637
It's right down there.
Right down the hall.

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.133
I made some coffee.

01:35:50.269 --> 01:35:51.541
Would you like some?

01:35:51.677 --> 01:35:53.270
Uh, I also have tea.

01:35:53.406 --> 01:35:55.742
No, coffee's great. Thank you.

01:35:55.877 --> 01:35:56.882
Here you go.

01:36:01.446 --> 01:36:02.717
Did she tell you about me?

01:36:02.852 --> 01:36:06.050
Of course she did.

01:36:06.185 --> 01:36:10.387
And she told me
you were very upset
that you never met your father.

01:36:10.523 --> 01:36:11.921
So she told you
about my father?

01:36:12.057 --> 01:36:13.397
She did.

01:36:13.532 --> 01:36:14.866
[coffee pouring]

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.536
Don't you think
she could have helped him

01:36:16.671 --> 01:36:18.429
when he came back from the war?

01:36:18.565 --> 01:36:21.038
She helped him
as best she could.

01:36:21.173 --> 01:36:24.210
Your father came back
very badly damaged

01:36:24.346 --> 01:36:26.944
and he wanted to
move to another city
and start a new life.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:30.809
His plans never included you
or Martha.

01:36:30.944 --> 01:36:34.645
And your mother
accepted the end
of the relationship and...

01:36:36.054 --> 01:36:37.681
And she saw him
in such a bad way

01:36:37.816 --> 01:36:39.925
that she gave him a kiss
to give him some peace

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.257
and that kiss turned
into something more.

01:36:44.327 --> 01:36:46.195
And you are the fruit
of that moment.

01:36:47.793 --> 01:36:50.529
My mother never told me
anything about that.

01:36:50.665 --> 01:36:52.802
It's a difficult thing
to explain to a child.

01:36:52.938 --> 01:36:54.533
She could have told me later.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.975
By then you were so estranged

01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:58.878
that she didn't feel
it was possible anymore.

01:37:00.339 --> 01:37:02.480
She was a teenager,

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:03.815
she had a life to live,

01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:06.444
and your father
moved to San Diego

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.019
and he made no effort
to know you.

01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:20.361
So, Ingrid,

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:25.531
do you think
I was totally mistaken
about Martha?

01:37:26.638 --> 01:37:29.441
You were unfair,

01:37:29.576 --> 01:37:32.769
but no one can blame you
for wanting to know
who your father was.

01:37:35.813 --> 01:37:37.146
It's a sad story,

01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:39.149
it was very painful
for both of you.

01:37:43.186 --> 01:37:44.823
Don't be so hard on yourself,

01:37:44.959 --> 01:37:46.552
Martha wasn't
the perfect mother.

01:37:48.187 --> 01:37:49.489
No, she wasn't.

01:37:54.129 --> 01:37:55.693
Can I stay here tonight?

01:37:55.828 --> 01:37:58.696
Yes, of course.
This is your mother's house!

01:38:01.367 --> 01:38:02.365
[crickets chirping]

01:38:02.501 --> 01:38:04.875
[Ingrid] <i>Dear Martha,</i>

01:38:05.011 --> 01:38:07.580
<i>I thought you'd like to know
I've come back to the house
in the woods</i>

01:38:07.716 --> 01:38:09.212
<i>to gather up your things.</i>

01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:13.981
<i>Your daughter came to see me.</i>

01:38:14.116 --> 01:38:15.647
<i>I'm still shaking.</i>

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:19.423
<i>She looks so like you.</i>

01:38:19.558 --> 01:38:22.893
<i>She asked me if she could stay
and sleep in your bed...</i>

01:38:23.028 --> 01:38:24.590
<i>and, of course, I said yes.</i>

01:38:26.729 --> 01:38:29.034
<i>I think your death
has brought her closer to you.</i>

01:38:33.139 --> 01:38:35.774
<i>I never thought
I'd inherit her,</i>

01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:37.911
<i>even if it's just for a day.</i>

01:38:39.143 --> 01:38:41.343
<i>The house is filled with you.</i>

01:38:44.384 --> 01:38:48.044
<i>When I came in,
after talking to the police,</i>

01:38:48.179 --> 01:38:50.550
<i>the first thing I saw
was the door of your room,</i>

01:38:52.022 --> 01:38:54.554
<i>and it was open.</i>

01:38:54.689 --> 01:38:57.792
<i>And I said to myself,
"She's alive."</i>

01:38:57.927 --> 01:38:59.823
[birds chirping]

01:39:31.758 --> 01:39:33.923
I came out here
to listen to the birds.

01:39:36.598 --> 01:39:38.400
Your mother
would get up like this,

01:39:39.539 --> 01:39:40.798
at dawn,

01:39:42.039 --> 01:39:43.471
and lie right there.

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:51.347
Look, it's snowing.

01:39:53.146 --> 01:39:54.383
[sighs]

01:39:55.183 --> 01:39:56.946
[wind blowing]

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:01.720
The snow is falling.

01:40:04.426 --> 01:40:05.728
It's falling on the lonely pool

01:40:05.864 --> 01:40:07.165
we never used.

01:40:09.529 --> 01:40:10.795
It's falling on the woods,

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:14.002
where we walked and you lay,

01:40:14.138 --> 01:40:16.504
exhausted, on the ground.

01:40:19.244 --> 01:40:21.443
Falling on your daughter
and on me.

01:40:24.811 --> 01:40:26.943
Falling upon the living
and the dead.
