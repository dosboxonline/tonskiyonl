WEBVTT

02:30.955 --> 02:33.249
Une bière, s'il vous plaît.

02:52.768 --> 02:54.562
Merci.

04:39.041 --> 04:40.501
We are closed.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.336
Just a small drink.

04:49.051 --> 04:51.095
The toilets?

05:44.023 --> 05:47.777
A quick drink and then l'll leave.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.698
Why are you rushing off?

05:52.823 --> 05:55.993
- Hmm?
- l said, why are you rushing off?

05:56.076 --> 05:57.787
l don't understand.

05:59.121 --> 06:01.040
The man from Bristol called ya.

06:06.837 --> 06:09.381
- What man?
- The man in the wheelchair.

06:46.085 --> 06:48.504
What were you doing back here?

06:50.089 --> 06:51.507
Lady,

06:51.590 --> 06:55.177
l never walk into a place
l don't know how to walk out of.

06:56.387 --> 06:58.264
Then why would you get into that van?

06:58.389 --> 07:00.808
You know the reason.

08:11.337 --> 08:14.048
Make yourselves at home.

08:14.131 --> 08:16.675
You've come a long way.

08:16.759 --> 08:19.762
- Thanks for coming.
- What's the job?

08:19.845 --> 08:23.641
There's some people
who have something we require.

08:23.766 --> 08:27.186
- And we want you to get it from them.
- lt involves shooting?

08:28.312 --> 08:30.856
You must be tired.

08:30.981 --> 08:33.150
We'll tell you more tomorrow.

08:39.823 --> 08:43.994
Seven fat years
and seven lean years.

08:44.078 --> 08:46.914
- That's what it says in the Bible.
- You ever kill anybody?

08:46.997 --> 08:49.583
l hurt somebody's feelings once.

08:56.132 --> 08:57.883
Don't l know you?

08:59.885 --> 09:03.389
l don't think so. l'd remember.

09:10.563 --> 09:12.440
Okay, two-hour shifts.

09:12.565 --> 09:15.276
l'll watch the front,
you guys watch the back.

09:17.528 --> 09:19.113
Merci.

09:31.959 --> 09:33.836
You awake, then?

09:35.671 --> 09:38.215
Hmm?

09:40.759 --> 09:42.636
How we doin'?

09:47.433 --> 09:48.851
Yep.

10:07.077 --> 10:08.996
You labour or management?

10:09.205 --> 10:13.250
lf l was management,
l wouldn't have given you a cigarette.

10:14.919 --> 10:18.964
l am the tour guide.
Over there is the Eiffel Tower.

10:19.048 --> 10:21.842
Over here, the Louvre.
Over there, les toilettes.

10:21.967 --> 10:24.303
What do l call you?

10:24.428 --> 10:27.098
- My name is Vincent.
- Sam.

10:30.309 --> 10:35.064
As per the agreement,
your salary will be $5,000 a week

10:35.147 --> 10:37.817
with a minimum
of four weeks' work.

10:37.942 --> 10:40.319
On the successful completion
of the mission,

10:40.444 --> 10:44.281
you will each receive
a bonus of $20,000.

10:45.783 --> 10:49.870
And by the way,
my name is Deirdre.

10:49.954 --> 10:52.915
- The broad outlines of the mission are...
- Who are your principals?

10:53.040 --> 10:54.875
For you,
there's no one but myself.

10:55.084 --> 10:57.002
Huh?

10:57.086 --> 11:00.089
And what can we infer
from your charming lrish lilt?

11:00.214 --> 11:03.300
- Anything you like.
- Where's the equipment?

11:03.425 --> 11:05.928
Tell me what you need, make a list,
and give it to Vincent.

11:06.053 --> 11:09.306
- Some of the equipment's quite technical.
- lf it's in Paris, l'll find it.

11:09.390 --> 11:12.852
This is what we're after.

11:12.977 --> 11:16.939
We need to take it intact from several
men who'll be intent on preventing us.

11:17.064 --> 11:19.358
- How many men?
- You American?

11:19.442 --> 11:23.320
l think the group will be between
five and eight. No more than eight.

11:23.446 --> 11:27.992
- You don't know for sure?
- Not now but l will know before the event.

11:28.075 --> 11:31.620
lf you don't know,
why say between five and eight?

11:31.704 --> 11:33.622
There's two to three cars.
The group's travellin'.

11:33.706 --> 11:35.082
- They're not in Paris?
- No.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.083
Where are they?

11:36.208 --> 11:38.794
- You'll find out soon enough.
- What's in the case?

11:40.463 --> 11:43.424
Our plan, in broad strokes, is an ambush.

11:43.549 --> 11:46.135
lt's to hit the car,
to take them in transit.

11:46.260 --> 11:50.014
- Transit? City? Country?
- Right now, as l said, l don't know.

11:50.097 --> 11:52.475
But we've to move very quickly.

11:52.600 --> 11:57.062
We'll start with this: Ambush
and assault on two to three vehicles,

11:57.146 --> 12:01.817
five to eight men, and our objective
is the safe retrieval of this case.

12:01.901 --> 12:05.613
Tell Vincent
what it is you'll need.

12:05.738 --> 12:10.618
What do we know about them?
Are they French? Who are they?

12:10.701 --> 12:13.996
All you need to know right now
is that they're very unpleasant.

12:14.121 --> 12:18.751
- You've done this kind of thing before?
- You know...

12:18.834 --> 12:19.919
How difficult can it be?

12:20.044 --> 12:22.129
We have no idea
how these men will be armed?

12:22.254 --> 12:24.715
lt seems they'll be
very well armed, indeed.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.884
Where are we going and
how are we getting back from there?

12:26.967 --> 12:30.137
lt'll be in France, and the group
will disband at the RV point.

12:30.221 --> 12:33.891
- What does she mean?
- After that, we're on our own.

12:33.974 --> 12:36.685
- lt's a military term.
- That's right.

12:36.769 --> 12:38.312
Larry, tell Vincent what you'll need.

12:38.437 --> 12:43.317
Something very fast. Audi S-8.
Something that can shove.

12:43.442 --> 12:46.195
l'm going to have it for you
by the afternoon.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.990
l'll also need a nitrous system.
l've got the specs.

12:54.662 --> 12:57.081
What do you use, weapons-wise?

12:57.206 --> 12:59.416
- Hmm?
- Weapons.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.586
- l'm a... l'm a weapons man.
- Weapons man.

13:02.670 --> 13:04.588
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:04.713 --> 13:08.717
They tend to settle the argument.
So what do you favour?

13:08.843 --> 13:12.430
Well, you know. lt's a toolbox.
You put the tools in for the job.

13:12.555 --> 13:13.722
What?

13:13.806 --> 13:16.934
You know,
l actually favour the old 1911.

13:17.017 --> 13:20.438
.45. Old gun.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.358
lt served my country well.
A long time.

13:24.525 --> 13:26.902
Your country!

13:27.027 --> 13:29.071
Not done too well, have you,
last few wars?

13:29.196 --> 13:31.615
Perhaps not, but at least
we don't go around whining about it.

13:34.243 --> 13:35.035
You ex-military?

13:35.119 --> 13:37.121
No, l got my job
through the New York Times.

13:38.664 --> 13:42.001
- Don't let him get you down.
- lt don't mean nothin' to me.

13:42.084 --> 13:43.919
l say what l think.

13:44.003 --> 13:46.464
Are you ex-military?

13:46.589 --> 13:48.757
Boys at Hereford?

13:48.924 --> 13:51.594
l'm sorry, but l'd like to go backwards.
The line of retreat is...

13:51.677 --> 13:56.223
She just told you.
We meet back at the RV, disband.

13:56.348 --> 14:00.311
l understand. l'm just trying to get
a vague notion of the opposition.

14:00.394 --> 14:06.066
We're gonna cause some animosity.
How many will be coming after us?

14:06.192 --> 14:09.278
- You worried about your own skin?
- Yeah, l am.

14:09.361 --> 14:11.238
lt covers my body.

14:12.698 --> 14:16.035
All your concerns will be addressed
before we leave.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.704
- Electronics and commo.
- Not more than three cars?

14:18.788 --> 14:20.164
That is our information.

14:20.372 --> 14:23.042
- Can you get me a simulator?
- What's a simulator?

14:23.125 --> 14:26.337
Gunpowder. Sound only, no lead.
Sounds like a pistol.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.047
Quite diverting.

14:28.130 --> 14:31.801
Listen, l'm also gonna need
some bigger injection jets.

14:31.884 --> 14:34.512
The Bosch is not gonna do it.
They have to be custom-made.

14:34.595 --> 14:37.598
We going north? We going south?

14:37.681 --> 14:40.976
l'd like some new clothes.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.687
- Vincent will sort you out.
- l'll take care of it.

14:50.611 --> 14:53.781
- So what brought you here?
- A fella that doesn't work so well.

14:55.116 --> 14:57.493
The man in the wheelchair?

14:58.369 --> 14:59.829
How did he get there?

14:59.912 --> 15:04.792
That was in your neck of the woods,
back in the late unpleasantness.

15:16.137 --> 15:17.430
Good reflexes.

15:18.973 --> 15:20.766
Oh, yeah.

15:21.267 --> 15:23.436
They die hard.

15:30.401 --> 15:34.029
- lnterrogation.
- What?

15:34.113 --> 15:38.200
- Methods to withstand interrogation.
- You've done that?

15:38.325 --> 15:41.287
We were taught
to hold out indefinitely.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.792
- Nobody can hold out indefinitely.
- Ah, is that so?

15:46.876 --> 15:52.548
Everybody has a limit. l spent
some time in interrogation... once.

15:52.631 --> 15:54.967
- They make it hard on you?
- They don't make it easy.

15:55.342 --> 15:59.430
Yeah, it was unpleasant.
l held out as long as l could.

15:59.513 --> 16:02.183
All the stuff they tried.

16:02.308 --> 16:04.643
You just can't hold out for ever.

16:04.727 --> 16:07.438
- lmpossible.
- How'd they finally get to you?

16:07.563 --> 16:10.274
- They gave me a grasshopper.
- What's a grasshopper?

16:10.399 --> 16:14.945
That's two part gin, two part brandy,
one part crème de menthe...

16:15.070 --> 16:17.114
Fuckin' smartass!

16:17.990 --> 16:20.993
- Can you find this place?
- Of course.

16:21.118 --> 16:23.037
l know it.

16:23.162 --> 16:26.165
That's where
they wanna do the exchange.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.125
You're gonna exchange for cash?

16:29.126 --> 16:33.255
- You know these people?
- My people know them.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.591
Your people have done business
with them before?

16:35.674 --> 16:38.552
Or these people
just gave your people a number?

16:49.313 --> 16:51.607
Larry.

16:55.277 --> 16:58.906
Okay. lf we're gonna do it,
let's do the goddamn thing right.

17:01.826 --> 17:04.619
- Hey!
- l'm busy.

17:05.871 --> 17:08.165
Okay, come on. Let's go.

17:08.290 --> 17:11.836
The answers to your questions
l'll know when l get back.

17:11.919 --> 17:15.047
- l'll go with you.
- Go with them.

17:35.317 --> 17:37.194
Who does this girl work for?

17:37.278 --> 17:41.657
Well, she works for our betters.

17:41.740 --> 17:44.910
lt seems that's what
we're meant to know.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.713
Always a waiting game.

17:55.796 --> 17:59.633
- What?
- lt's a waiting game.

18:02.136 --> 18:05.389
Hey, wait.
Would you not do that, please?

18:07.475 --> 18:10.603
Bad for the night vision, yeah?

18:16.776 --> 18:19.069
There they are.

19:07.326 --> 19:10.079
- You have the list?
- Yes, l have it.

19:10.204 --> 19:11.914
Give it to me.

19:15.209 --> 19:17.711
Money?

19:19.004 --> 19:21.507
Okay. You follow my lead.

19:21.632 --> 19:23.884
Just make sure you watch my back.

19:28.681 --> 19:30.391
Don't make any sudden moves.

19:30.808 --> 19:34.437
Just because we're buying guns
doesn't mean we didn't bring any.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.773
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

19:40.443 --> 19:43.028
You want to back him up?

19:46.991 --> 19:49.118
What would l profit from your death?

19:49.201 --> 19:52.705
- Well, you'd have the money.
- l have the money already.

19:54.623 --> 19:57.042
l'll watch the back.

20:01.172 --> 20:02.798
- Have you got it all?
- Oui.

20:04.592 --> 20:08.012
- You're sure?
- Of course. Come and see.

20:18.314 --> 20:19.315
There it is!

20:39.293 --> 20:41.754
lt's not all here.

20:43.672 --> 20:45.883
- Vincent.
- What?

20:49.887 --> 20:52.598
lt's not all here.

20:52.681 --> 20:54.475
- C'est tout?
- Ah, non, non, non.

20:54.683 --> 20:58.938
Le patron va contrôler l'argent.
Vous aurez le reste de la marchandise.

20:59.021 --> 21:03.067
Tiens. ll est là dans la voiture,
avec le patron.

21:03.150 --> 21:07.571
He said the rest is in the other car.
The boss wants to check the money.

21:07.655 --> 21:10.908
If he agrees, we have no problem.

21:10.991 --> 21:12.785
Here, take the car keys.

21:12.910 --> 21:15.996
Go on. Take them.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.627
Come on. Come.

21:23.254 --> 21:25.965
Okay, give me...
Give me some of the money.

21:33.139 --> 21:36.142
Give me some of the money!

21:38.102 --> 21:40.438
- Okay.
- You aren't going in there?

21:40.521 --> 21:44.692
- Yeah, l am, and so are you.
- Why am l going in there?

21:44.817 --> 21:48.821
- Why? To protect me.
- There is no protection there.

21:48.904 --> 21:52.366
lf it's a come-on, we're fish in a barrel.
Why do they want you in there?

21:52.450 --> 21:54.910
- What are you, crazy?
- You know, you think too hard.

21:55.035 --> 21:58.622
Nobody ever told me that before.
But l wouldn't go in there.

22:00.374 --> 22:03.878
- What is it, Sam?
- l don't like it. Look at it.

22:05.504 --> 22:07.423
Okay, okay.

22:07.506 --> 22:09.967
Okay, let's just do it.
Let's just do it and be done, yeah?

22:10.926 --> 22:12.344
You don't wanna go in there.

22:13.846 --> 22:17.808
- l'm getting paid to go. lt's that simple.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

22:17.892 --> 22:21.520
lf anything goes down,
get next to one of those guys.

22:21.645 --> 22:23.773
lf there's a sniper,
he'll be afraid to shoot his own guy.

22:23.898 --> 22:25.608
- Let's go!
- All right.

22:47.755 --> 22:49.673
Stop!

22:49.757 --> 22:51.967
Stay where you are.

23:07.775 --> 23:10.444
So, everything's fine.

23:21.372 --> 23:23.415
Shit! l can't see! l can't see!

23:36.387 --> 23:38.305
Have some of this!

23:42.977 --> 23:44.520
Fuckin' arsehole!

23:49.150 --> 23:52.278
Fuckin' have some more, you bastards!

23:54.029 --> 23:55.948
Come on! Come on!

23:57.366 --> 23:59.743
Let's go!

23:59.910 --> 24:04.165
- No! You goddamn...
- Come on! Let's go!

24:17.136 --> 24:19.096
- ls anybody hurt?
- We're fine.

24:21.056 --> 24:25.853
Almost a bit of raspberry jam
back there, yeah?

24:25.936 --> 24:27.855
A bit of raspberry jam back there!

24:31.609 --> 24:35.279
Got the swag, kept the money.
Job well done.

24:35.362 --> 24:37.281
That's a fact. That is a fact.

25:02.765 --> 25:03.891
Slow down. Slow down.

25:05.976 --> 25:08.187
l think l have to stop.

25:37.091 --> 25:37.925
Thank you.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.397
Why did you take this job?

25:53.983 --> 25:56.026
My friend, l need the money.

25:57.153 --> 25:59.488
The money is here.

26:03.784 --> 26:06.954
That's what this is, you know? Money.

26:11.041 --> 26:12.960
Yeah, but who are our employers?

26:15.629 --> 26:17.506
You're right.

26:45.993 --> 26:47.828
Excuse me.

26:47.995 --> 26:50.498
Excuse me, monsieur.

26:59.340 --> 27:01.675
The Russians are bidding for the case.

27:01.759 --> 27:05.805
The case is in Nice.
They're trying to sell it to the Russians.

27:05.888 --> 27:09.183
They're staying at
the Villa Belle Mer in Nice.

27:10.351 --> 27:14.814
- The team isn't ready.
- Whatever the team is, you do it now.

27:14.939 --> 27:18.025
The Russians have decided to bid.
We need to move now.

27:18.150 --> 27:20.194
Excuse me.

27:20.402 --> 27:23.864
l have the information.
We'll be movin' very soon.

27:23.989 --> 27:25.908
lt'll definitely
be in the nature of an ambush

27:26.033 --> 27:29.870
somewhere between here and here.

27:29.995 --> 27:34.375
We'll anticipate
a three-car convoy with a backup team.

27:34.458 --> 27:38.045
We will try and stop the target
before they can get away from us.

27:38.170 --> 27:40.131
- What's in the case?
- That information isn't necessary.

27:40.256 --> 27:42.216
ls it heavy? ls it explosive?

27:42.383 --> 27:44.343
ls it chained
to some unlucky bloke's wrist?

27:44.468 --> 27:46.512
- Are we gonna have to chop it off?
- All right.

27:46.595 --> 27:48.806
l don't have to let you know...

27:48.931 --> 27:52.309
Then the price has got to go up.

27:52.435 --> 27:54.270
l'll get you the case,
but the price has gotta go up.

27:54.395 --> 27:57.148
lf it's gonna be amateur night,
l want $100,000. l want it up front.

27:57.231 --> 28:01.944
l want it in a bank account. l want
another $100,000 when you get the case.

28:34.268 --> 28:37.188
Okay.

28:38.397 --> 28:42.568
We've got shooters here, shooters here.

28:42.651 --> 28:44.528
l'll tell you an old trick.

28:44.653 --> 28:45.362
Hey.

28:55.039 --> 28:57.708
- What's your problem?
- Draw it again.

28:59.126 --> 29:02.421
Draw it again.
You're the ace field man. Draw it again.

29:02.546 --> 29:06.175
lt's a simple diagram.
Just draw it again. Draw what you saw.

29:06.258 --> 29:10.846
Draw it again! Draw it again.

29:14.016 --> 29:17.478
Two shooters.
Car comes through here.

29:17.603 --> 29:19.605
Shooters across from each other,
kill each other dead.

29:19.730 --> 29:22.525
- Oh, my. Where'd you learn that?
- ln a regiment.

29:22.691 --> 29:25.152
- What regiment was that?
- The 22nd Special Air Service.

29:25.236 --> 29:27.655
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

29:27.780 --> 29:30.366
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

29:30.449 --> 29:32.409
- l don't like your attitude.
- What's the colour of the boathouse...

29:32.535 --> 29:35.079
- Fuck off!
- What's... You got the gun. l'm unarmed.

29:35.162 --> 29:38.165
Do something. Go ahead.
Do something. Do something.

29:38.290 --> 29:40.209
Do something.

29:51.345 --> 29:53.848
Tell me about an ambush?
Don't tell me about an ambush!

29:53.931 --> 29:56.976
l ambushed you with a cup of coffee.

30:00.771 --> 30:03.107
You'll get your money
when we get the case.

30:03.190 --> 30:05.985
- The others, too.
- That is what l understood.

30:06.068 --> 30:07.945
Come on.
We've gotten the word. We're movin'.

30:15.327 --> 30:17.246
Put this near the front.

30:18.831 --> 30:22.126
Careful! Careful with that!

30:33.387 --> 30:37.016
So what colour
is the boathouse at Hereford?

30:37.141 --> 30:39.059
How the fuck should l know?

31:01.457 --> 31:03.334
This'll complete your compensation.

31:06.837 --> 31:09.840
Thanks for your time.
Feel free to leave when we're gone.

31:11.467 --> 31:13.344
Do l need to suggest that you forget us?

31:16.430 --> 31:18.766
Because we will not forget.

32:23.539 --> 32:27.084
- Morning.
- l see you're reviewin' our problem.

32:27.168 --> 32:29.754
Well, either you're part of the problem,
part of the solution,

32:29.837 --> 32:32.089
- or you're just part of the landscape.
- lndeed.

32:33.466 --> 32:34.675
What's in the case?

32:35.760 --> 32:38.137
Something we're paying ya for.

32:53.068 --> 32:57.323
- You and the girl are in front of the hotel.
- The name's Deirdre.

32:57.448 --> 33:00.451
Deirdre.
Wait outside the hotel for the target.

33:00.576 --> 33:02.995
He leaves the hotel for the villa,
the villa for the hotel.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.288
He activates his cellphone.

33:04.371 --> 33:06.207
How do you know
he's gonna use his cellphone?

33:06.332 --> 33:09.210
- He'll use a phone.
- How do you know?

33:09.335 --> 33:11.712
- l'm gonna call him on it.
- How do you know he'll have it with him?

33:11.879 --> 33:14.090
He's waitin' for a call.

33:14.215 --> 33:18.427
His people will call him to tell him
the location of the meet.

33:18.552 --> 33:20.429
- Okay?
- Okay.

33:20.513 --> 33:23.849
The villa, the hotel, the car,
the stop light, 8 to 10 guys.

33:24.016 --> 33:25.851
How good's their...
How good's their security?

33:25.935 --> 33:29.021
- l can't tell you.
- Well, let's find out. Where are they?

33:29.146 --> 33:31.023
The last report, they were at the hotel.

33:31.190 --> 33:33.025
- The case is at the hotel?
- We presume that it is.

33:33.192 --> 33:35.903
- That's interesting.
- Why don't we do it now?

33:35.986 --> 33:39.406
- lt's tempting.
- lt's a good plan. Let's stick to the plan.

33:39.532 --> 33:43.202
Everybody wants to go to the party.
Nobody wants to stay and clean up.

33:43.285 --> 33:45.704
- Please.
- The only thing is that the map...

33:45.788 --> 33:48.499
The map is not the territory.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.418
Let's go look at the ground.

33:51.544 --> 33:54.547
Bring some money.
We're gonna do a little shopping.

34:02.888 --> 34:04.640
Listen up.

34:05.808 --> 34:08.686
You're my wife.
Be who you wanna look like.

34:08.811 --> 34:11.981
lt's just a game. Just a game.

34:12.063 --> 34:14.900
Man and a woman going for a walk.

34:14.984 --> 34:18.612
Piece of cake.
Relax. Relax, darling.

34:20.322 --> 34:22.241
You look good cleaned up.

34:26.245 --> 34:28.164
ls that the hotel?

34:43.804 --> 34:46.639
Put your arm under mine.
Put your arm under mine.

34:48.516 --> 34:51.771
Why aren't they at the villa?
Why are they down here?

34:51.896 --> 34:53.981
Fun and games?
Pretty girls and beer or what?

35:07.870 --> 35:11.207
Can l help you, sir?

35:11.499 --> 35:13.542
No. We're looking at the menu.

35:19.965 --> 35:21.383
Merci.

35:51.330 --> 35:55.042
Uh, excuse me?
Do you speak English?

35:55.126 --> 35:55.626
A little.

35:55.751 --> 35:58.462
Could you take a picture
of me and my wife?

35:58.587 --> 36:01.298
lt's very easy. You press like that.

36:01.424 --> 36:04.802
- Sure.
- Like that. That's it. Focus like that.

36:04.969 --> 36:06.804
Okay?

36:08.264 --> 36:10.224
We're gonna do it over here.

36:13.185 --> 36:17.022
Can you get that palm tree in?
We wanna show we're on the Riviera.

36:18.858 --> 36:22.027
- How many do you want?
- Just snap away.

36:24.029 --> 36:27.491
Very good. Again.

36:27.616 --> 36:30.828
Again. Get the background.

36:32.455 --> 36:35.249
Take a couple of my wife, alone.

36:45.384 --> 36:48.929
Take my luggage up right away.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.475
Thank you.

36:54.143 --> 36:57.938
Can we take one picture of you
with my wife? One picture with you?

36:59.190 --> 36:59.940
That's it.

37:07.740 --> 37:10.159
So?

37:10.284 --> 37:12.453
Well, they're good.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.997
Guy goes for the case,
other guy's protecting the principal.

37:15.164 --> 37:16.999
Nobody panics. They're good.

37:17.124 --> 37:20.544
- So what have we learned?
- Can it be done?

37:20.628 --> 37:23.214
lt can be done.
We should have two more men.

37:23.339 --> 37:26.092
- We don't have two more men.
- Go to your handler.

37:26.175 --> 37:28.052
- There is no handler.
- Let me go.

37:28.177 --> 37:30.346
There's no handler.
There's only me.

37:30.471 --> 37:33.557
Listen, you want the case,
we're gonna need some more men.

37:33.682 --> 37:36.811
There's no more help,
there's no more men. Are you afraid?

37:36.936 --> 37:39.313
Of course l'm afraid. You think
l'm reluctant because l'm happy?

37:39.396 --> 37:42.733
We've made a good plan,
and we're gonna stick with it.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.615
What do we do?

37:50.699 --> 37:52.118
We wait.

37:53.077 --> 37:57.790
- So, who are they?
- Our employers.

38:03.045 --> 38:05.256
- Qui est là?
- lt's me.

38:06.382 --> 38:08.843
They've gone back to the villa.

38:08.968 --> 38:11.220
- Did they have the case with them?
- They did.

38:11.345 --> 38:13.139
- Did you get the other cars?
- Got 'em.

38:13.305 --> 38:16.058
- And how do they run?
- They'll do fine.

38:19.854 --> 38:21.730
Yeah.

38:23.482 --> 38:25.443
Well, what does that mean?

38:27.820 --> 38:30.072
lt would be nice to do something.

38:30.197 --> 38:32.700
We are doing something.
We're sitting here, waiting.

38:41.959 --> 38:44.128
lt's not gonna happen today.

38:44.253 --> 38:46.630
The buyers are out of town.

38:46.756 --> 38:49.091
Tomorrow at the earliest.

38:53.262 --> 38:55.431
You know what?
The hell with 'em. Let's go put 'em to bed.

38:55.598 --> 38:58.309
- We've got the report.
- lf l take the report, l got nothing else.

38:58.434 --> 39:01.312
l can go see for myself.
They at the villa?

39:01.395 --> 39:04.774
l'm gonna go take one last run
over the route and tuck 'em in.

39:12.072 --> 39:14.158
l'll come with ya.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.236
So how did you get started
in this business?

39:52.738 --> 39:56.200
A wealthy scoundrel
seduced and betrayed me.

39:57.535 --> 39:59.912
Same with me. How 'bout that?

40:01.580 --> 40:04.625
Take out the map. Take out the map.
lf anybody looks, we're...

40:20.724 --> 40:22.977
So who are those guys inside?

40:23.102 --> 40:25.813
You tell me.

40:25.896 --> 40:30.443
Ex-military, Northern Sov Block,
somebody or other.

40:30.568 --> 40:34.864
- They need a job. That's my excuse.
- ls it?

40:36.866 --> 40:38.742
Cops.

41:19.658 --> 41:22.286
System activated.

41:24.079 --> 41:26.791
System check.

41:29.293 --> 41:31.420
Repeat system check.

41:37.468 --> 41:40.679
There he is. He's being good.
He's activated his phone.

42:00.783 --> 42:02.868
l'm in position.

42:39.238 --> 42:42.950
- They're passin' me now.
- Target is on the way.

43:25.659 --> 43:28.746
Hell of a time to be workin'.

43:28.871 --> 43:30.748
What do you want for Christmas?

43:30.915 --> 43:33.542
My two front teeth.

43:33.667 --> 43:35.836
May your wish be granted.

44:10.162 --> 44:13.707
Target is 400 metres
from the traffic light.

45:15.186 --> 45:16.687
Come on! Come on!

45:41.879 --> 45:44.298
So far so good.
Target on the right road.

45:48.511 --> 45:50.304
Sam, escort car.

45:50.471 --> 45:53.307
- Four tenths of a click in front of you.
- Got it.

46:22.253 --> 46:25.923
Larry, you should see them in...
four seconds.

46:26.132 --> 46:27.800
Two cars.

46:29.176 --> 46:30.219
l got 'em.

47:13.053 --> 47:16.098
Target has escaped.
l repeat, target has gotten away.

47:58.516 --> 48:00.017
Target heading for Vieux Nice.

49:06.625 --> 49:09.003
Through the market, then straight.

49:17.511 --> 49:19.388
Right at the fork, Maréchal Foch.

49:27.980 --> 49:30.232
Okay, you're in front of him.

49:38.866 --> 49:42.620
- Cut him off at the end of the port.
- Roger that. l got it.

49:46.040 --> 49:47.541
He's coming from the right.

49:48.501 --> 49:49.710
He's yours.

50:49.437 --> 50:51.981
- l'm hit! Take the case!
- Up the other end!

50:52.064 --> 50:55.025
- Get the fucking case!
- Get the car up the other end!

50:55.151 --> 50:56.068
Take this!

50:57.403 --> 50:59.905
Get out of here!
l'll see you at the safe house!

51:04.368 --> 51:07.872
Hey! Get rid of the case!
Get rid of the case!

51:20.634 --> 51:22.386
Arrêtez-vous!

51:22.511 --> 51:25.306
- Where is Gregor?
- Gregor fucked us.

52:49.348 --> 52:51.267
- How is it out there?
- A lot of heat. A lot of heat.

52:51.350 --> 52:53.394
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

52:53.519 --> 52:56.397
- Thanks for before.
- Don't mention it.

52:58.107 --> 53:01.360
Could you clean the paint off this?

53:01.485 --> 53:04.572
- You got a pack of Camels in there?
- No, you smoke too much.

53:19.503 --> 53:21.338
We must get out ofhere.

53:22.631 --> 53:25.176
l'm gonna need your people to help us.

53:25.301 --> 53:28.220
- And l need you to find the case.
- All right, call your guy.

53:28.345 --> 53:30.765
When we bring in the case, he'll help you.

53:30.890 --> 53:33.768
- How can l bring him the case?
- Well, Gregor has it.

53:35.144 --> 53:38.105
- Why?
- l presume to sell it to the Russians.

53:38.189 --> 53:40.649
Why the Russians? Why not you?

53:40.775 --> 53:41.984
lf we had the money to buy the case,

53:42.067 --> 53:44.737
we wouldn't have
hired you to steal it, would we?

53:44.987 --> 53:47.573
- Go to your people. Talk to them.
- You want the case?

53:47.656 --> 53:49.575
We find Gregor, we find the case.

53:49.700 --> 53:52.745
- How do we find Gregor?
- How'd you find him in the first place?

53:52.828 --> 53:55.081
l found him
through your friend, the cripple,

53:55.164 --> 53:57.416
who gave me nothin'
but a bunch of fucking lames!

53:57.500 --> 54:01.837
You and Spence
and the whole sorry lot of you!

54:01.962 --> 54:03.839
We can find him through his cellphone.

54:07.760 --> 54:09.845
Can we trace his cellphone?

54:12.973 --> 54:16.185
They can triangulate it,
if we had that equipment.

54:16.268 --> 54:17.853
Who has that equipment?

54:20.564 --> 54:23.943
Who has that equipment?

54:25.402 --> 54:27.279
Tell me.

54:28.447 --> 54:30.324
Who has it?

54:30.407 --> 54:33.327
All right. All right.

54:33.452 --> 54:35.621
Give me the number to his phone.

55:17.455 --> 55:20.374
So, how does the day find you?

55:20.458 --> 55:24.420
How do they say it in French?
En pleine forme.

55:38.184 --> 55:40.603
This was supposed to be
a social occasion.

55:40.686 --> 55:44.315
- Life is uncertain.
- lt is indeed.

55:44.440 --> 55:47.443
But, Gregor,
we have so much history together,

55:47.568 --> 55:50.029
l was sure you wouldn't mind.

55:50.196 --> 55:53.783
- Besides, the world these days is so...
- Unsafe?

55:54.992 --> 55:56.076
Exactly.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.997
l'll show you how unsafe it is.

56:22.728 --> 56:25.648
See that little girl down there?

56:30.736 --> 56:34.156
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you do that?

56:34.281 --> 56:36.534
To make a point.

56:39.412 --> 56:42.456
l don't know her,
but l was ready to blow her brains out.

56:42.540 --> 56:46.877
But you,
l don't particularly like you.

56:47.002 --> 56:50.840
Just imagine what l'll do to you if you
try anything. Now give me my money.

57:07.064 --> 57:08.858
Put down the gun.

57:14.113 --> 57:18.117
- l never liked you either, Gregor.
- Where did that come from?

57:21.078 --> 57:22.997
l should have made you strip.

57:23.164 --> 57:25.875
- Now where's my package?
- lt's right behind you.

57:55.863 --> 57:57.323
Whoo-hoo!

57:57.448 --> 58:00.159
Clever girl.

58:00.242 --> 58:01.452
You liked it?

58:01.577 --> 58:03.871
My little sun.

58:05.498 --> 58:08.250
You make me so happy.

58:16.592 --> 58:18.010
ls it done?

58:19.637 --> 58:21.514
lt's done, Mikhi.

58:21.639 --> 58:25.434
Natacha?

58:25.518 --> 58:28.104
Gregor? ls that you, Gregor?

58:28.187 --> 58:30.147
Much to your disappointment,
no doubt.

58:30.231 --> 58:34.110
lt was a mistake.
lt should not have happened.

58:34.193 --> 58:37.363
Well, if it happens again,
l'll turn around and sell it to the lrish.

58:37.446 --> 58:40.741
- Don't do that.
- Then don't make me.

58:40.866 --> 58:42.701
My price just went up 300%.

58:44.537 --> 58:48.666
l want the package, Gregor.
What do l have to do to get it?

58:48.791 --> 58:50.709
Just wait for my next phone call.

58:50.793 --> 58:53.254
l'll find a place
where l can tilt the field in my favour.

59:37.548 --> 59:40.301
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

59:40.426 --> 59:42.636
Could you tell me
how to find a post office?

59:42.762 --> 59:46.015
Do... Do l know you?
l'm sorry. Do l know you?

59:46.140 --> 59:48.434
How did you know l speak English?

59:48.517 --> 59:50.936
You got an English newspaper.

59:51.061 --> 59:52.980
Sorry.

59:53.063 --> 59:55.107
- l'm sorry. l beg your pardon.
- lt's all right.

59:55.191 --> 59:57.777
Uh, what do you need
a post office for?

59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.696
'Cause over here,
they use them for different things.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.697
l need your help.

01:00:03.365 --> 01:00:05.242
- l thought you left.
- l did leave.

01:00:05.367 --> 01:00:07.578
- You did leave? You're out?
- That's right.

01:00:07.661 --> 01:00:10.039
Can you help me? l need your help.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.918
What's the number?

01:00:18.297 --> 01:00:21.175
Yeah, the post office is, uh,
just down to your left.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.052
- Up on the left? Thanks.
- On the left.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:34.855
- A friend of yours?
- We went to high school together.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:38.234
Everyone's your brother
until the rent comes due.

01:00:38.359 --> 01:00:39.944
Ain't that the truth!

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.530
Yes. Yes, on the terrace?

01:00:42.947 --> 01:00:44.365
Facing me? l see him.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:47.576
Yes, l'll get him. Hang on, please.

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:53.499
Excuse me, sir. Are you Sam?

01:00:56.502 --> 01:00:57.336
Yeah.

01:00:57.461 --> 01:00:58.921
Telephone for you.

01:01:07.763 --> 01:01:09.682
Yeah, good to see you, too.

01:01:09.807 --> 01:01:12.685
lf his position changes, l'll let you know.

01:01:19.358 --> 01:01:21.402
Gregor's in a town called Arles.

01:02:37.478 --> 01:02:39.897
He's at the arena.

01:03:12.304 --> 01:03:15.307
So this is the amphitheatre of Arles

01:03:15.433 --> 01:03:19.437
which was built
at the end of the first century AD.

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.939
lt is built with limestone.

01:03:29.447 --> 01:03:30.739
l know those men.

01:04:03.022 --> 01:04:06.066
And you can see
this dominant yellow colour

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:08.694
which is actually caused
essentially by a lantern.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:11.530
We're not sure that the walls
were actually yellow.

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.532
And so, now we will continue

01:04:13.657 --> 01:04:16.285
and visit the Roman baths
down this way.

01:04:29.924 --> 01:04:31.801
Yeah.

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:38.224
Thank you, gentlemen.
That'll do nicely.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.019
lt's Sergi. l remember you.

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.897
Yes, Gregor, it's me.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.734
- How have you been?
- Well. These are trying times.

01:04:48.901 --> 01:04:51.987
- l'm sorry about the unfortunate incident.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:55.574
lt was excessive.
And more to the point, it was foolish.

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:58.411
l couldn't agree with you more.

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.788
Mikhi did it without consulting me.

01:05:02.415 --> 01:05:05.167
Yeah, he's turned rogue
and can't be controlled, is that it?

01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:20.891
Excusez-moi.
Je cherche la vieille maison de Van Gogh.

01:05:21.016 --> 01:05:24.103
- l don't... l don't...
- Oh, English.

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.105
Sorry. Such a fool.

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:28.107
l was looking for Van Gogh's old house.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:32.611
So what could have been conducted
in a collegial atmosphere

01:05:32.736 --> 01:05:34.822
is now fucked into a cocked hat.

01:05:34.905 --> 01:05:38.868
- What do you think?
- l think we'll meet your price.

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:44.623
Yeah. Yes, so let's see it. Let's see it now.

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.167
Where do you have it, in your belt?

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.961
- Let's see it!
- Show me the case first.

01:05:51.255 --> 01:05:54.425
You're great in the locker room,
and your reflexes might die hard,

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:56.427
but you're weak
when you put your spikes on.

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:01.974
- Gregor? Are you all right?
- Gregor's fine.

01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:04.810
But l think you're in a wee spot of trouble.

01:06:05.936 --> 01:06:08.731
- Where is it? Where is it?
- l don't have it with me.

01:06:08.814 --> 01:06:09.815
Where?

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:12.401
l mailed it to myself.
A post-office box in Paris.

01:06:12.485 --> 01:06:13.527
Hilfe!

01:06:13.611 --> 01:06:15.279
Help! He's robbing me!

01:06:54.485 --> 01:06:56.529
Pardon. Pardon.

01:06:56.654 --> 01:06:58.447
Pardon. Avancez!

01:06:58.572 --> 01:06:59.407
Pardon.

01:08:03.888 --> 01:08:04.722
Stop.

01:08:08.476 --> 01:08:11.145
- Where do l know you from?
- Vienna.

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:14.899
Of course. l'm sorry to have to do this.

01:08:14.982 --> 01:08:16.024
Hey!

01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:36.087
- Christ.
- Drive.

01:08:58.192 --> 01:09:03.322
Stop! Descends! Vite! Descends!

01:09:20.506 --> 01:09:27.763
- l'm gonna have to take care of this.
- What do you want to do?

01:09:27.888 --> 01:09:31.642
Uh, get to a doctor
or a veterinarian's office.

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:34.060
l'll just boost what l need.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:41.484
- Could you do that?
- Of course. l can do better.

01:09:44.196 --> 01:09:46.448
- How is it?
- l'm leakin'.

01:09:47.825 --> 01:09:49.535
l'm sorry.

01:09:54.165 --> 01:09:56.041
That girl sold us out.

01:10:00.713 --> 01:10:03.591
She sold us out.

01:10:55.142 --> 01:10:58.104
- Ready, Jean-Pierre?
- Everything's ready.

01:11:17.456 --> 01:11:19.417
Get my legs up.

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:21.419
Careful.

01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:33.222
Are you sure you can do this?

01:11:33.347 --> 01:11:36.892
Yeah. l once removed a guy's appendix
with a grapefruit spoon.

01:11:37.017 --> 01:11:40.312
- Have a drink.
- No booze. No.

01:11:46.026 --> 01:11:50.990
Easy, easy, easy.

01:11:57.037 --> 01:12:00.875
lt's just below the surface.

01:12:02.334 --> 01:12:05.504
All right, let's do it.
Just douse it with alcohol.

01:12:09.008 --> 01:12:11.469
Take the gauze and wipe away
as much of the blood as you can.

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:13.763
Keep it clean so l can see it.

01:12:18.225 --> 01:12:20.144
Yeah. That's it.

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:29.111
All right.
What we're gonna do is routine.

01:12:29.236 --> 01:12:31.739
l've done this many times before.

01:12:31.864 --> 01:12:34.033
There are no vital organs, arteries.
lt's okay.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.285
You won't kill me.
Just make sure you get the bullet

01:12:36.368 --> 01:12:38.454
- before you pry it out.
- All right.

01:12:38.579 --> 01:12:40.456
Take that scalpel.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.879
The upper part.

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.466
Over here. Just cut up there.

01:12:50.549 --> 01:12:52.426
Just a little cut.

01:13:03.395 --> 01:13:05.272
Okay. Got it.

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:09.026
Now take the clamp.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.862
Take the clamp and open up... the hole.

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:14.532
Just put it in there.

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:17.535
Put it in there.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.537
That's it. Put it in. Just...

01:13:19.703 --> 01:13:21.914
Now open it up. Spread it. Spread it.

01:13:22.039 --> 01:13:24.417
Okay. Okay.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.586
Now get the other...
Get the other clamps and get the bullet.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.713
Remember, don't take it out
unless you really got it.

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:51.485
Do it again. Do it again.
Just try once more.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:01.287
l'm sorry.

01:14:03.247 --> 01:14:07.126
When he pulls it out, put the gauze in.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.

01:14:12.798 --> 01:14:14.675
Put the gauze there.

01:14:24.685 --> 01:14:27.021
Fucker sprayed his bullet with Teflon.

01:14:28.355 --> 01:14:32.193
He was trying to stamp me ''paid in full''.

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:35.154
- ls that why it went through the vest?
- Yeah.

01:14:36.947 --> 01:14:39.700
You think you can stitch me up
on your own?

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:44.705
lf you don't mind,
l'm gonna pass out.

01:15:34.338 --> 01:15:36.841
You gonna kill me?

01:15:36.924 --> 01:15:40.845
No. l'm not gonna kill ya.

01:16:08.414 --> 01:16:10.291
Why would l want to kill ya?

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.480
- l gave you a job.
- l did my job.

01:16:33.647 --> 01:16:35.274
So how'd it go wrong?

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.401
l thought you wanted the case.

01:16:38.652 --> 01:16:40.404
Oh, we'll get the case.

01:16:40.488 --> 01:16:43.574
We'll get the case, eh, Gregor?

01:16:45.326 --> 01:16:47.203
Don't you worry about the case.

01:16:49.663 --> 01:16:51.832
What l want's an explanation.

01:16:51.957 --> 01:16:54.627
An explanation? For what?

01:16:54.794 --> 01:16:56.754
You bollixed it up.

01:16:56.962 --> 01:16:59.882
- l bollixed it up?
- You hired him.

01:17:00.007 --> 01:17:01.884
Through your fucking contact!

01:17:07.973 --> 01:17:11.685
- You didn't do your homework.
- Why did you have to kill Larry?

01:17:11.769 --> 01:17:13.646
Oh, Larry, is it?

01:17:14.814 --> 01:17:16.690
l was clearing up your mess.

01:17:16.774 --> 01:17:19.693
My mess?
Oh, well, you take over, then.

01:17:19.819 --> 01:17:21.695
- Eh?
- But you can't, can you?

01:17:21.821 --> 01:17:23.948
lt's you that's hiding, isn't it, Seamus?

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:26.492
lt's you that can't show your face.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.623
Who else thinks that?
Who you been talking to?

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.959
lsn't that the reason
why l'm doing this job?

01:17:38.546 --> 01:17:40.423
You're a good girl, Deirdre.

01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:43.759
Do your job, eh?

01:17:57.481 --> 01:17:59.567
He's tough, your Yank.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:02.611
You're right about that.

01:18:04.822 --> 01:18:06.115
But who is he?

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.618
That's not important.

01:18:10.661 --> 01:18:13.414
Didn't he work for the ClA?

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.333
He used to.

01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:18.544
Not anymore?

01:18:20.087 --> 01:18:21.797
He's on the run.

01:18:23.257 --> 01:18:24.800
You're sure?

01:18:24.884 --> 01:18:29.847
l know what he can do.
l've seen him.

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:32.391
Why would he carve himselfup
ifhe were still ClA?

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:35.102
He makes a call and it's taken care of.

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:47.656
And you? How are you?

01:18:56.457 --> 01:19:01.921
We need some information.
We need to find some people in Paris.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:03.005
Who?

01:19:03.547 --> 01:19:06.258
An lrish man and woman,

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.594
a German, an ex-KGB.

01:19:09.386 --> 01:19:10.513
They're professionals.

01:19:10.596 --> 01:19:12.056
They're in hiding.

01:19:12.765 --> 01:19:15.851
This is really important to you?

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.606
He saved my life.

01:19:23.442 --> 01:19:24.318
Bon.

01:19:26.779 --> 01:19:29.323
l'll find them for you.

01:19:48.092 --> 01:19:50.845
Where's the case?

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:56.267
lt will come tomorrow. l'm sure.

01:19:56.434 --> 01:19:59.937
Well, l'm sure it will, too. Let's go.

01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:03.399
Let's hope so, for your sake, anyway.

01:20:35.055 --> 01:20:37.224
Are you feeling better?

01:20:37.349 --> 01:20:39.518
Yeah, enough to move around. Thanks.

01:20:49.487 --> 01:20:51.363
My hobby.

01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:54.366
One grows old.

01:20:56.077 --> 01:20:57.953
l knew a lot of fellas, friends of mine,

01:20:58.079 --> 01:20:59.955
they just wanted to live to open a bar.

01:21:00.039 --> 01:21:02.541
Had they lived,
would they have done it?

01:21:05.711 --> 01:21:08.881
- Then they were spared their disillusion.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:21:10.925 --> 01:21:13.052
Who were these people?
Friends of yours?

01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:19.016
- l wouldn't hurt a friend.
- Was that my question?

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:21.852
That's right.

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:30.694
Well, who are you?

01:21:32.363 --> 01:21:35.825
A fella like you,
trying to make it to retirement.

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:40.079
At the end of the day, we're likely
to be punished for our kindnesses.

01:21:40.162 --> 01:21:43.207
You don't have to worry about me.
l won't hurt you.

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:13.362
The 47 ronin, do you know it?

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:20.911
47 samurai whose master
was betrayed and killed by another lord.

01:22:20.995 --> 01:22:24.498
They became ronin, masterless samurai,

01:22:24.623 --> 01:22:26.876
disgraced by another man's treachery.

01:22:28.335 --> 01:22:30.921
For three years they plotted,
pretending to be thieves,

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.716
mercenaries, even madmen.

01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:36.260
That l didn't have time to do.

01:22:36.343 --> 01:22:38.721
And then one night they struck,
slipping into the castle

01:22:38.846 --> 01:22:40.806
of their lord's betrayer, killing him.

01:22:42.308 --> 01:22:44.727
Nice. l like that. My kind of job.

01:22:44.852 --> 01:22:46.812
There's something more.

01:22:48.439 --> 01:22:52.568
All 47 of them committed seppuku,

01:22:52.693 --> 01:22:55.988
ritual suicide,
in the courtyard of the castle.

01:22:56.113 --> 01:22:58.908
Well, that l don't like so much.

01:22:59.033 --> 01:23:02.161
- But you understand it?
- What do you mean, l understand it?

01:23:04.205 --> 01:23:08.876
The warrior code, the delight in the battle.
You understand that, yes?

01:23:10.169 --> 01:23:13.089
But also something more.

01:23:13.172 --> 01:23:15.549
You understand there is something
outside yourself

01:23:15.674 --> 01:23:18.052
that has to be served.

01:23:18.177 --> 01:23:20.387
And when that need is gone,

01:23:20.513 --> 01:23:23.974
when belief has died, what are you?

01:23:24.058 --> 01:23:26.060
A man without a master.

01:23:26.227 --> 01:23:29.063
Right now l'm a man
without a pay cheque.

01:23:29.188 --> 01:23:32.900
The ronin could have hired
themselves to new masters.

01:23:33.025 --> 01:23:35.194
They could have fought
for themselves.

01:23:35.319 --> 01:23:38.322
But they chose honour.
They chose myth.

01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:41.325
They chose wrong.

01:23:49.083 --> 01:23:51.669
Seppu... Seppu... what?

01:23:51.794 --> 01:23:53.963
Yes, seppuku.

01:23:54.046 --> 01:23:56.298
Disembowelment.

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:59.176
The sword goes in here.

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:11.313
Are you sure this address is good?

01:24:11.439 --> 01:24:13.357
Jean-Pierre gave it to me.

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:50.311
Under the bridge by the river...

01:24:50.436 --> 01:24:53.063
How did you know
it was an ambush?

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:55.691
Whenever there is any doubt,
there is no doubt.

01:24:55.816 --> 01:24:57.693
That's the first thing they teach you.

01:25:01.405 --> 01:25:04.116
Who taught you?

01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:07.411
l don't remember.
That's the second thing they teach you.

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:14.919
All good things
come to those who wait.

01:25:45.699 --> 01:25:49.286
- Why is Gregor still alive?
- He's taking them to the package.

01:26:13.894 --> 01:26:15.104
How ya doin'?

01:26:22.903 --> 01:26:25.656
What are you...
What are you gonna do to me?

01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:31.036
Let's just be calm for one more moment.
One more moment.

01:26:43.758 --> 01:26:45.801
Why? Why?

01:26:45.926 --> 01:26:47.970
You know why.

01:26:48.053 --> 01:26:50.222
No. You don't wanna do that.

01:26:54.059 --> 01:26:55.019
You can't.

01:26:59.982 --> 01:27:00.608
Get back!

01:27:02.234 --> 01:27:04.195
Get in the fucking car!

01:27:14.163 --> 01:27:15.706
Why didn't you shoot her?

01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:09.635
Take the tunnel, now!

01:28:09.718 --> 01:28:11.720
Oh, Christ!

01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:16.183
Eh, merde!

01:31:24.663 --> 01:31:25.998
Come on! Come on!

01:31:51.148 --> 01:31:53.109
All right, you fuck!

01:35:20.066 --> 01:35:22.443
Where could he be?

01:35:22.526 --> 01:35:26.489
- Where could he be?
- Hmm.

01:35:26.614 --> 01:35:30.076
The lrish and the Russians are looking
for him. So where does he go?

01:35:30.201 --> 01:35:34.038
He goes to the Russians
to make the deal for the case.

01:35:34.163 --> 01:35:37.625
Gregor ain't comin' in unless
he can figure out a safe exchange.

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:39.919
He knows they'll kill him for the case
rather than pay him for it.

01:35:40.044 --> 01:35:45.382
He's got to work it out soon
before the lrish find him.

01:35:46.717 --> 01:35:48.552
So where does he go?

01:35:50.429 --> 01:35:52.306
You go to what you know.

01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:59.647
He's KGB.
He goes to one of his old safe houses.

01:36:01.107 --> 01:36:03.734
No, they're all blown.

01:36:03.859 --> 01:36:06.237
Where does he go?

01:36:11.992 --> 01:36:15.413
So, you're on the run.
Where do you go?

01:36:15.538 --> 01:36:17.456
Hmm?

01:36:21.585 --> 01:36:26.006
Where's he been? Where's he been?
Where's he been? Where's he been?

01:36:37.768 --> 01:36:40.354
He made the fake case.

01:36:40.438 --> 01:36:42.815
He had the fake case made.

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:46.402
Gregor. He had it made.

01:36:46.527 --> 01:36:49.071
He had to have had it made.

01:36:50.614 --> 01:36:53.701
ln Paris, before we went to Nice.

01:36:53.784 --> 01:36:55.619
He didn't have time to have it made.

01:36:55.745 --> 01:36:57.913
He bought something that looked like it,
then spray-painted it.

01:36:57.997 --> 01:37:00.583
Where did he get the spray?
He never left the room.

01:37:00.708 --> 01:37:02.668
Where did he get the case?

01:37:12.303 --> 01:37:14.555
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

01:37:35.868 --> 01:37:37.703
lt's a case for ice skates.

01:37:41.332 --> 01:37:43.209
Why ice skates?

01:37:45.544 --> 01:37:47.505
And why would Gregor
know an ice-skate case?

01:37:49.548 --> 01:37:52.009
He didn't have time to have it made.

01:37:52.134 --> 01:37:56.931
He didn't have time to have it made.
The Russians made it.

01:37:58.891 --> 01:38:01.477
The Russians made it.

01:38:04.647 --> 01:38:06.482
We're following the wrong people.

01:38:06.607 --> 01:38:09.527
We don't have to find Gregor.

01:38:09.652 --> 01:38:12.363
We find the Russians,
they will take us to him.

01:38:12.488 --> 01:38:16.367
You've lived in Paris
a long time. You know the people.

01:38:16.450 --> 01:38:19.495
- l get around.
- You meet the new Russians.

01:38:19.578 --> 01:38:23.499
You know how it is.
Ex-spies. Now it's Mafia.

01:38:24.375 --> 01:38:26.502
Under diplomatic cover.

01:38:28.087 --> 01:38:29.088
KGB?

01:38:29.338 --> 01:38:30.297
Ex-KGB.

01:38:30.714 --> 01:38:35.302
Heavy hitters, gamblers,
lots of money, big cars.

01:38:35.428 --> 01:38:36.804
They live like tsars.
Throw money away.

01:38:36.887 --> 01:38:38.764
Fur hats are expensive.

01:38:38.848 --> 01:38:44.270
- And bodyguards.
- Expensive coats, Dr Zhivago.

01:38:44.395 --> 01:38:47.565
l have a lot of work, no time.

01:38:49.024 --> 01:38:50.693
l understand.

01:38:52.403 --> 01:38:54.113
All right. Let's go.

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:56.031
Okay.

01:39:03.205 --> 01:39:04.832
lt will be fine.

01:39:06.292 --> 01:39:08.169
The guy is gonna reach out.

01:39:08.252 --> 01:39:10.171
ls he any good?

01:39:10.296 --> 01:39:13.174
Jean-Pierre says if it's Russian
and it's in Paris...

01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:27.688
lfl wanted to find Russians
in Paris this week,

01:39:27.772 --> 01:39:31.942
l'd go to the ice show.

01:40:45.975 --> 01:40:48.102
- Bonsoir, Pierre.
- Bonsoir.

01:40:48.185 --> 01:40:50.104
Je vais payer pour votre soeur.

01:40:50.187 --> 01:40:53.566
Oh, merci beaucoup,
Mademoiselle Kirilova.

01:41:00.072 --> 01:41:04.827
l'll trade you a cigarette for a favour.

01:41:05.369 --> 01:41:07.288
The favour is, steer clear of those guys.

01:41:07.371 --> 01:41:08.873
Who? The Russians?

01:41:15.379 --> 01:41:17.590
They sure throw their money around.

01:41:18.716 --> 01:41:19.800
Bonsoir.

01:41:19.884 --> 01:41:22.094
- ça va?
- Salut.

01:41:25.431 --> 01:41:27.308
- Bonsoir.
- Ah, bonsoir.

01:41:33.814 --> 01:41:38.152
The Russian is seeing Natacha Kirilova,
the star of the ice show.

01:41:38.235 --> 01:41:41.822
He spends every evening in the audience.

01:41:43.074 --> 01:41:44.617
How did you find that out?

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.953
We went to high school together.

01:42:22.238 --> 01:42:24.657
Mikhi, is everything all right?

01:42:25.491 --> 01:42:26.867
Everything is fine.

01:42:28.077 --> 01:42:29.120
Sweet girl.

01:42:31.914 --> 01:42:32.915
Go. Go on.

01:42:51.934 --> 01:42:53.644
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:42:53.728 --> 01:42:57.022
We are very proud to present...

01:42:57.106 --> 01:43:04.029
.. two-time Olympic champion
and three-time World champion,...

01:43:04.113 --> 01:43:07.700
.. Natacha Kirilova!

01:45:13.993 --> 01:45:15.911
Let's go.

01:45:29.258 --> 01:45:31.385
Wait out here.

01:45:36.348 --> 01:45:38.601
Yes, he is.

01:45:38.684 --> 01:45:40.728
Hello, Mikhi.

01:45:40.936 --> 01:45:44.940
- The meeting is not till later tonight.
- The meeting's now.

01:45:48.277 --> 01:45:49.862
You have the money?

01:45:51.197 --> 01:45:55.117
Well, we were going to go back
to get it before the meet.

01:45:55.242 --> 01:45:56.327
l don't think so.

01:45:57.787 --> 01:45:59.705
You have the money?

01:46:04.126 --> 01:46:07.129
l might have the money.
Where is the case?

01:46:07.213 --> 01:46:11.592
No, you have to do it.
l couldn't live with myself.

01:46:24.563 --> 01:46:26.440
l have the money.

01:46:26.565 --> 01:46:29.068
We conclude this now
and part friends.

01:46:29.151 --> 01:46:30.945
Okay?

01:46:33.864 --> 01:46:34.907
Where is the case?

01:46:47.294 --> 01:46:49.171
l'd like to be paid now.

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.929
No doubt.

01:47:01.684 --> 01:47:03.561
Now tell me the other part.

01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:07.189
The other part?

01:47:07.356 --> 01:47:09.191
l'm leaving.

01:47:09.316 --> 01:47:12.194
l'm taking my fee and l'm leaving.

01:47:13.821 --> 01:47:16.907
l have a person with a rifle in the stadium.

01:47:17.116 --> 01:47:19.952
l've worked with her for years.
She never misses.

01:47:20.077 --> 01:47:23.038
l will call.

01:47:23.164 --> 01:47:25.499
l have to call within 45 seconds

01:47:25.624 --> 01:47:27.668
to say that l'm leaving,

01:47:27.877 --> 01:47:31.005
and then in another 10 minutes
to say that l'm safe.

01:47:32.673 --> 01:47:36.594
Should l be unable to call,
your friend will be shot.

01:47:46.437 --> 01:47:48.314
30 seconds, Mikhi.

01:47:49.732 --> 01:47:52.234
- We need to get inside.
- You can'tpass without badges.

01:47:59.575 --> 01:48:01.410
20 seconds.

01:48:12.088 --> 01:48:13.089
10 seconds.

01:48:42.326 --> 01:48:45.204
There were two ofthem.

01:48:45.287 --> 01:48:46.997
They were looking for those guys.

01:48:47.081 --> 01:48:49.250
Just a minute, sir!

01:49:05.808 --> 01:49:09.729
I am a Chilean citizen,
as you can see from my passport.

01:49:09.812 --> 01:49:11.480
Merci.

01:49:49.935 --> 01:49:53.105
- Mama!
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:49:58.944 --> 01:50:00.571
Katchev!

01:50:00.654 --> 01:50:01.822
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

01:50:16.879 --> 01:50:17.838
Stay with him.

01:50:50.704 --> 01:50:53.249
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

01:50:53.416 --> 01:50:56.210
Get out of the car.
Walk away. Walk away!

01:50:56.293 --> 01:50:59.130
Walk away! Go. Go.

01:50:59.213 --> 01:51:02.091
- l will if you will.
- Just go.

01:51:02.174 --> 01:51:04.635
Come with me.
Forget about the case.

01:51:09.056 --> 01:51:11.517
l didn't come for the case.
l came for your boss.

01:51:13.394 --> 01:51:15.980
l came for Seamus. l came for him.

01:51:17.356 --> 01:51:22.278
Just get out of here.
l never left. Don't you see?

01:51:23.654 --> 01:51:25.948
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:35.666
Get out of the way!

01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:37.084
This way is blocked.

01:52:04.904 --> 01:52:06.781
l can take you in or leave you here.

01:52:08.282 --> 01:52:09.533
There. That's him with the case.

01:52:09.617 --> 01:52:11.744
Sir! Over here, please.

01:52:11.869 --> 01:52:12.578
Wait! Wait!

01:52:20.211 --> 01:52:23.255
There are more back there!

01:53:00.543 --> 01:53:02.420
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

01:53:02.503 --> 01:53:06.382
Don't move! Shut your fuckin' mouth up!
Shut your mouth!

01:53:20.396 --> 01:53:22.231
You stupid shite.

01:53:22.398 --> 01:53:25.943
You're a dead man.

01:53:48.466 --> 01:53:50.843
This is the BBC World Service.

01:53:50.968 --> 01:53:53.679
lt was announced today,
after almost 30 years

01:53:53.763 --> 01:53:57.141
ofbloody and seemingly intractable
civil conflict in Northern lreland,

01:53:57.224 --> 01:53:59.143
that a peace agreement
has been reached between

01:53:59.268 --> 01:54:02.480
the predominantly Protestant
government ofthat British-ruled enclave,

01:54:02.605 --> 01:54:05.149
and the lrish resistance...

01:54:09.987 --> 01:54:13.532
.. have told CNN that it was
the apprehension and slaying

01:54:13.657 --> 01:54:18.496
in France ofthe lrish terrorist Seamus
O'Rourke, byparties still unknown,

01:54:18.579 --> 01:54:20.873
that contributed a stability,
largely allowing

01:54:20.998 --> 01:54:25.002
the negotiations to proceed
to their historic conclusion today.

01:54:25.127 --> 01:54:28.047
O'Rourke had earlier
been denounced by the lRA,

01:54:28.172 --> 01:54:32.218
the military wing of Sinn Fein,
as a rogue breakaway operative.

01:54:34.762 --> 01:54:38.099
Well, then, good knowin' ya.

01:54:48.818 --> 01:54:49.819
Hmm?

01:54:49.902 --> 01:54:53.114
- l'm sorry?
- You said something.

01:54:53.197 --> 01:54:56.659
l said she would not
be coming back here.

01:54:58.869 --> 01:55:03.332
Yeah. She would
not be coming back here, would she?

01:55:09.588 --> 01:55:11.674
l can't even put my hand in my pocket
to pay the bill.

01:55:11.757 --> 01:55:13.884
l'll get it.

01:55:16.429 --> 01:55:18.264
l'll get the next one.

01:55:24.603 --> 01:55:26.355
What was in the case?

01:55:26.564 --> 01:55:28.607
l don't remember.

01:55:29.942 --> 01:55:31.485
Lesson number two.

01:55:33.654 --> 01:55:35.531
Keep in touch.

01:55:54.049 --> 01:55:55.885
Let's go.

01:56:09.106 --> 01:56:11.901
No questions, no answers.

01:56:11.984 --> 01:56:14.070
That's the business we're in.

01:56:14.195 --> 01:56:16.489
You accept it and move on.

01:56:17.907 --> 01:56:20.701
Maybe that's lesson number three.
