00:01.335 --> 00:02.794
<i>Previously
on "The Rookie"...</i>

00:02.795 --> 00:04.379
<i>Seth told me that
his high-school girlfriend</i>

00:04.380 --> 00:05.964
<i>died of an OD, but then he
told Miles that she died</i>

00:05.965 --> 00:08.675
<i>in a car accident--there's
something off with him.</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:10.510
Uh, Nolan.
This is my sister, Genny.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.345
What can you tell me about
that guy crossing the street?

00:12.346 --> 00:15.432
His colors and the tattoos
suggest that he is affiliated.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.684
I'd say he's a part
of the Sixth Street Devils.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.562
I messed up
with Lucy, I think.

00:20.563 --> 00:23.356
So you want to talk now, or--
- Do we need to talk?

00:23.357 --> 00:25.024
We can go back to normal.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.861
It seems clear that we have a
second serial killer at large.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.612
<i>I think Glasser is my guy.</i>

00:29.613 --> 00:33.074
Now you are in the spotlight,
and you will stay there

00:33.075 --> 00:36.369
until I find a way to hang
these murders around your neck

00:36.370 --> 00:39.039
and lock you away forever.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.716
Do you ladies have any advice
for a newly minted P2?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.968
Oh, I have so much advice
about so many things.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.053
You're going to have to be
a little bit more specific.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.055
Here's the thing--every year
on the job is different.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.390
Every case is different.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.893
You never really stop
being a rookie.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.394
I like that.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.979
Oh, god, it's 8:00 a.m.,
and it's already scorching.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.898
He couldn't have picked
a trail with more shade?

01:04.899 --> 01:06.733
Glasser lives
at the bottom of the hill.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.818
He hikes this trail
twice a week.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.653
How does a serial killer
find more time

01:10.654 --> 01:11.780
to work out than I do?

01:11.781 --> 01:13.573
He has a lot of time
on his hands.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.492
With the LAPD watching
his every move,

01:15.493 --> 01:18.620
he hasn't been able to indulge
in his favorite hobby.

01:18.621 --> 01:19.829
Wait, are we sure about that?

01:19.830 --> 01:20.914
I thought Grey cut
his surveillance in half.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.584
I have been
picking up the slack.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.589
OK, on top of all your other
cases and being a mom?

01:29.590 --> 01:31.174
You must be exhausted.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.927
It's not so bad,
and it's not going be forever.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.137
Glasser will slip up,
and when he does,

01:36.138 --> 01:38.181
I will be the one
to put the cuffs on him.

01:38.182 --> 01:39.933
Does anybody else
smell smoke?

01:39.934 --> 01:43.812
Yeah, there must be a fire
up north somewhere.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.865
Get her away from him.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.116
Hey, we got you.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.868
This is
Detective Nyla Harper.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.954
We have a fast-moving wildfire,

02:00.955 --> 02:03.873
trailhead of Pullman
and Harriman Avenue.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.066
<i>- ♪ Don't be anybody... ♪</i>

02:30.067 --> 02:31.901
Got it.
Where do you need me?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.069
Morning. Copy.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.571
Absolutely.
Better safe than sorry.

02:34.572 --> 02:35.989
Hey, there's coffee
in the kitchen.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.657
I got to go--
fire is spreading fast,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.075
and Grey needs me
on road closures.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.577
I have no idea
when I'll be home.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.245
No, that's okay.
Court's going remote today.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.997
They don't want anybody
getting stranded.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.040
Okay, bye. Mwah.
both: Love you.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.084
Bye.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.253
So, uh, it's just you

02:50.254 --> 02:52.088
and three kids
under the age of five?

02:52.089 --> 02:54.173
Just for an hour.
Sidney gets in around 9:00.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.925
Okay, well, um,
if something comes up,

02:55.926 --> 02:58.052
I'm manning a shelter
over at Hollenbeck.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.221
Hey, you be good
for Uncle Wesley, okay?

03:00.222 --> 03:01.514
Mwah!

03:02.725 --> 03:04.267
Oh, sounds like
your friend Emmy's up.

03:07.271 --> 03:11.107
Wow, Leah, what did you eat?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.860
Potty's broken.

03:13.861 --> 03:17.071
Uh...

03:17.072 --> 03:20.116
Hey, Sidney, yeah, I was just
thinking about you.

03:20.117 --> 03:24.037
Uh-huh.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.122
No, no, no, no, no, I get it.
The roads are a mess.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.124
There's no point
endangering yourself.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.877
Just, um, stay home.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.046
I got this.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.050
Is it a mess?

03:37.051 --> 03:38.635
Yeah.

03:38.636 --> 03:41.137
According to LAFD,
fire is zero percent contained,

03:41.138 --> 03:43.139
moving at wind speed
south toward structures.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.058
Natural causes
or deliberate 4-51?

03:45.059 --> 03:47.143
Unknown at this time.
Harper thinks Glasser set it.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.562
Lucy says it's too soon.
- All right.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.815
I'll order mandatory holdover
and authorize paid overtime.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.901
Coordinate with North Hollywood
for staging areas,

03:54.902 --> 03:57.904
evacuation routes, and make
sure that the fire broadcast

03:57.905 --> 03:59.781
updates
on the mutual aid channel.

03:59.782 --> 04:02.158
- Copy.
- Where do you want us?

04:02.159 --> 04:04.243
Tim won't have time
to train today.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.620
Take Officer Penn.
- Happy to.

04:05.621 --> 04:06.996
Check in with Harper.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.831
She's coordinating the
Western District evacuation.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.083
Yes, sir.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.168
Should I join Officer Chen
in the field?

04:12.169 --> 04:13.836
No, I need extra pair
of hands here.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.171
Yeah, I'm happy to help.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.589
Don't get too excited.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.591
Your job's to be yelled at
all day.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.676
Right.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.803
We need to be
in constant contact

04:21.804 --> 04:24.806
with city, state,
and federal agencies.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.933
This one is for FEMA.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.310
This is
National Weather Service,

04:29.311 --> 04:31.020
and this is LAFD.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.606
Now, each phone
has several lines.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.274
It's important
to keep them straight.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.609
Okay, got it.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.277
Why aren't you writing
any of this down?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.696
Oh, I'll remember.

04:39.697 --> 04:42.949
Son, today is going to hit
you like a freight train.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.953
In an hour, you won't remember
your middle name.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.705
Every time I look at you,

04:48.706 --> 04:52.834
I want to see paper and a pen
at all times.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.127
Yes, sir.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.796
Ridley.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.675
Right, it's the--

05:00.676 --> 05:03.387
Got it, and I got the pen too.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.018
Dress is BDUs and duty belts.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.477
Thank you.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.062
This entire neighborhood,
all the way down to Sunset,

05:13.063 --> 05:15.148
is under mandatory evacuation,
so I need you

05:15.149 --> 05:16.691
doing door to door.
- Copy that.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.151
Ooh, these are
a lot more comfortable

05:18.152 --> 05:19.402
than our regular uniforms.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.903
Yeah, why can't we
wear this every day?

05:20.904 --> 05:22.697
Because we look
like mall security.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.657
Honestly,
I wouldn't mind that.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.160
Oh, um, Grey wanted
your help at the shelter

05:27.161 --> 05:29.412
and reunification center.
- Okay, you got it.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.331
See you guys.
- Bye.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.666
Later.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.001
All right,
start with the north side

05:35.002 --> 05:36.669
and make note
of everyone you talk to.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.171
What if they
don't want to go?

05:38.172 --> 05:39.881
Then you ask them
for their dentist's office,

05:39.882 --> 05:41.758
because we will need a way
to identify their remains.

05:41.759 --> 05:45.011
Will do.
All right.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.938
Is Glasser's surveillance
duty taking over?

05:55.939 --> 05:57.732
Grey can't spare
the manpower.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.276
Hey, this neighborhood
is under an evacuation order.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.945
You need to pack up and head
to the Hollenbeck shelter.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.031
Are you here
to help us or watch us?

06:05.032 --> 06:07.366
Oh, I don't think the, uh,
LAPD is going to have time

06:07.367 --> 06:09.869
to harass us today, honey.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.080
They're going to have
their hands full--

06:12.081 --> 06:13.790
evacuations, looting.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.917
I hope nothing falls
through the cracks.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.794
Oh, don't worry.
It won't.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.799
All right, let's get packing.
Come on, buddy.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.138
It's creepy how easily
he can fake loving his family.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.892
They're his disguise.
They just don't know it.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.977
Genny, everything okay?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.104
No.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.814
I just got a call
from the boys' school.

06:37.815 --> 06:39.816
They're closing early
because of the air quality--

06:39.817 --> 06:42.068
a thing that never happened
when I lived in Ohio.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.112
The problem is I just left
work on the West Side,

06:44.113 --> 06:46.739
and with all the road closures,
it's going to take me--

06:46.740 --> 06:48.241
It won't even give me
an estimate.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.118
I think the map
is laughing at me.

06:50.119 --> 06:52.120
- I can pick up the kids.
<i>- You sure?</i>

06:52.121 --> 06:54.122
I know you must be busy.
- It's no problem.

06:54.123 --> 06:55.998
They can hang at my place.
-  Thank God.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.417
Thank you. I will be there
as soon as I can.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.754
Okay. Bye.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.090
No, no, that--that street
has already been evacuated.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.925
I--
No, not you.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.969
Officers have not reached
Wentworth yet.

07:07.970 --> 07:11.013
Yeah, can, um--

07:11.014 --> 07:14.350
Yes, Mrs. Deputy Mayor--uh,
Ms. Deputy Mayor, how can I--

07:14.351 --> 07:16.018
Yes, absolutely.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.104
Let me just patch
you right through.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.357
Did you just hang
up on the mayor?

07:21.358 --> 07:23.109
No, no, I--

07:23.110 --> 07:24.777
Maybe.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.362
Let the boss know
I'm on the move.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.447
Radio if you need anything.
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.783
No, I'm not--
no, I'm not talking to you.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.368
All right, so we're
about to be overrun

07:32.369 --> 07:34.120
with families
in need, all right?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.955
So we need beds ready,
grab-and-go food,

07:35.956 --> 07:37.373
and an open line
of communication

07:37.374 --> 07:40.793
with other emergency services,
all right?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.044
Welcome.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.338
Thank you.
Nyla sends her love.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.798
Oh, really?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.383
Well, I mean,
she definitely would have

07:47.384 --> 07:49.343
if she thought of it--
she's, uh, a little busy.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.803
I understand.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.471
So you're the LAPD
liaison officer?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.807
I'm here to reunite families,
direct them to resources,

07:54.808 --> 07:57.393
and get anyone missing
into the MUPS system ASAP.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.395
Great. Well, there's
an open table over there.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.356
You can set up by the door.
- Thank you.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.900
Kylie.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.484
We've missed you over
at the community center.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.028
You know you're the only one

08:07.029 --> 08:08.487
who appreciates
my taste in music.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.072
- Tolerates.
- Oh, okay.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.991
I see you singing along.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.911
Where have you been?
- Just around.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.330
I was hoping to volunteer
here today.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.165
We're happy to have you.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.208
Come on.

08:20.209 --> 08:23.002
Oh, thank you.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.046
You haven't seen
the incredibly tedious task

08:25.047 --> 08:26.505
I have for you.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.050
No, I mean, I've been
going through a lot lately,

08:29.051 --> 08:31.470
and seeing you
always makes things better.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.932
Ah, that's, uh--
that's great to hear.

08:35.933 --> 08:39.852
Come on, let's get to work.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.123
Grab a line,
start knocking down the fire.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.584
Hit the hydrant--we need
to spray down these houses.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.419
Got it.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.463
Hey, there.
Don't I know you?

09:07.464 --> 09:10.049
You're so familiar--I feel
like maybe we used to date?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.051
Unlikely.
I'm way out of your league.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.302
Fair.
How's the evacuation going?

09:13.303 --> 09:14.720
- We got two streets cleared.
- Good.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.973
We'll do a thorough wet-down--
unless the wind changes,

09:16.974 --> 09:18.391
we should be able to save
the houses.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.476
Boss, we got a problem.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.979
No time for subtlety.
This truck needs water.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.897
Should we help push it
out the way?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.983
No need.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.486
Firefighters don't mess around.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.118
What the hell are you doing?

09:37.119 --> 09:39.120
You know how much
that car costs?

09:39.121 --> 09:40.413
Gun!

09:40.414 --> 09:42.832
Put it on the ground!
- Drop it!

09:47.087 --> 09:48.754
All right,
secure the weapon.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.424
Go on.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.926
I swear, LAPD is going
to have to start paying me.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.054
Hey, if you're flirting
with me, I'm married.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.598
Yeah, no, thank you,
Your Honor.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.436
I think a continuation is wise,
given my current situation.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.354
Okay.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.106
Okay, go play.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.775
Oh.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.111
Hey, you calling
to check on Leah?

10:12.112 --> 10:15.865
Um, yes, and also
to ask some legal advice.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.992
Right. Well, Leah is fine,
although she did manage

10:17.993 --> 10:19.785
to activate
a middle-finger emoji

10:19.786 --> 10:21.704
while I was Zooming the judge.

10:21.705 --> 10:22.955
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.125
Yeah, neither did I,
and he was not amused.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.043
What's up?

10:27.044 --> 10:28.169
Uh, so what is my wiggle room

10:28.170 --> 10:29.628
on taking a look
inside Glasser's house?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.380
We are in a mandatory
evacuation zone,

10:31.381 --> 10:33.382
and the family's
packing to leave.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.509
All right, um, no warrant is
needed for protective sweep

10:35.510 --> 10:37.553
during an evacuation
as long as you limit

10:37.554 --> 10:39.388
your search to a place
where a person could hide.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.683
Perfect. Thanks.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.561
Good, you got your belt on.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.230
Hey.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.816
Hey!

10:51.818 --> 10:53.402
Hey.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.405
What the hell are you doing?
- Protective sweep.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.866
It is legal as long
as I limit my search

10:58.867 --> 11:02.661
to places people can hide,
like a closet.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.332
So you can look
for a body hiding,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.334
but you can't go
through drawers

11:08.335 --> 11:11.837
looking for trophies that,
uh--that looters might steal.

11:11.838 --> 11:12.922
Exactly.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.715
Well, unfortunately
for looters,

11:14.716 --> 11:16.842
we don't keep anything of value
here--that would be stupid.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.844
Oh, and you are
far from stupid, huh?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.597
You know, tell me--is it
hard to keep your real self

11:21.598 --> 11:25.267
hidden away from your family?

11:25.268 --> 11:27.353
Do you show
the killer inside you

11:27.354 --> 11:30.272
to your husband
and your two lovely children?

11:32.275 --> 11:34.568
How many has it been?

11:34.569 --> 11:37.905
Two men murdered in the line
of duty, or is it three?

11:37.906 --> 11:41.450
Do you dream about them?

11:41.451 --> 11:44.955
Do you relive the moment you
ended each of their lives?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.457
All clear.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.210
Get out.

12:02.973 --> 12:06.351
Thanks for all the help, Nyla.
- Detective Harper.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.064
You ready, bud?
Let's go.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.917
- How's the evacuation going?
- About 80% there.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.919
Good.
Follow Glasser to the shelter.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.588
Make sure someone
always has eyes on him.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.339
Well, Grey wanted us
back on the streets.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.632
Calls for service.
- Tell him I made you.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.093
That's all I need.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.435
- Where's Kojo?
- Uh, he's at dog day care.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.104
Listen, your mom will be back
in a few hours.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.274
Until then, do whatever you're
supposed to do after school.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.943
It's usually a lot of PS5
and popcorn.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.362
Yeah, it's hours and hours
of "Miles Morales."

13:00.363 --> 13:01.697
She's...

13:01.698 --> 13:03.991
Real strict about that.
- I bet.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.117
Nice try.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.203
We usually do homework,
then piano,

13:07.204 --> 13:09.622
then online language lessons
and meal prep.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.374
Your mom runs a tight ship.
I respect that.

13:12.375 --> 13:16.462
Get all of that done, you can
fire up the PS5, all right?

13:16.463 --> 13:21.593
I'll be back.

13:23.678 --> 13:27.139
What should we do first?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.058
Maybe wait until I pull away

13:29.059 --> 13:31.227
before you ignore
my instructions.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.480
Yes, sir.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.649
Yes, absolutely.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.235
I will get that
to you right here.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.736
Thank you so much.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.363
Hi, welcome.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.365
Uh, if I can just
have your names

13:44.366 --> 13:47.494
and contact information
so I can get you in the system.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.498
How's it going, officers?

13:52.499 --> 13:55.501
I thought I, uh, lost you
back at the light on Western.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.419
No, sir,
but I would recommend you drive

13:57.420 --> 14:00.089
a little more carefully
with your family in the car.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.007
Does the baby need a crib?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.676
No, we co-sleep.
Three beds is fine.

14:03.677 --> 14:07.012
Okay, great,
uh, well, I can give you...

14:07.013 --> 14:09.682
C-8 through 10.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.684
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.270
Oh, and I have something extra
special for the little man.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.357
Oh, that's so sweet.
Thank you.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.448
- Keep an eye on him.
- All righty.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.287
Where do you want
to put the baby?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.705
Just right here.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.587
How's it going here?

14:39.588 --> 14:41.297
Oh, you know,
just controlled chaos.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.715
Emphasis on "chaos." Yeah.
- Right.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.550
- Hey, it's good to see you.
- Need a hand?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.051
- No, no, I got it.
- All right.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.053
- Then why are you hiding?
- I'm not.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.432
We need to know you're solid.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.725
Excuse me.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.768
You, uh, here
to help volunteer?

14:54.769 --> 14:58.063
Get lost.
I'm talking to Kylie.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.231
Yeah, it doesn't seem

14:59.232 --> 15:01.066
like she really wants
to talk to you.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.320
Stay out of this or get hurt.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.738
Let's talk outside.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.073
Whoa, whoa.
Don't touch her.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.287
I'll be back.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.497
Honey, I'm going to, uh,
head to the warehouse,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.082
make sure everything's
all squared away.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.460
- What?
- I'll be back in a bit.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.465
Is there a problem here?

15:24.466 --> 15:25.675
No.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.344
No problem.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.347
We'll talk later.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.100
Be cool.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.810
Thanks.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.564
You okay?
- I'm fine.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.149
What was that about?

15:42.150 --> 15:44.736
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.366
You're supposed
to be watching Glasser.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.119
I-I heard the crash,
and I came to check in--

15:55.288 --> 15:56.830
Mrs. Glasser, do you know
where your husband is?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.207
Why, so you
can harass him again?

15:58.208 --> 15:59.875
He's done nothing wrong.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.127
And I appreciate that, but my
boss is breathing down my neck.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.797
I just need to know
where he is.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.548
He left to check
the warehouse,

16:06.549 --> 16:10.469
make sure everything
was secure.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.516
- What's wrong?
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

16:15.517 --> 16:16.809
Glasser is gone.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.894
His wife said he went to
go check his warehouse.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.480
Damn it!

16:21.481 --> 16:23.565
He'll ditch the car
the first chance he gets.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.859
He has been planning this
right under our noses.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.403
It's not your fault
he got away.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.821
You know that, right?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.656
I should have followed him
to the shelter myself

16:30.657 --> 16:32.366
and parked right on his ass.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.909
Okay, I'm going
to say something,

16:33.910 --> 16:35.661
and I want you to know
it comes from a place of love.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.329
This is what you do.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.914
You throw yourself
into the job,

16:38.915 --> 16:40.874
following suspects
on your free time,

16:40.875 --> 16:42.710
going undercover for years.

16:42.711 --> 16:46.422
And as one of the people who's
safer because of it, thank you.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.425
But you need to look after you.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.260
So are--are--are we going
to look for Glasser,

16:51.261 --> 16:53.554
or are we going to have
a therapy session?

16:53.555 --> 16:56.516
I said what I needed to say.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.786
He knew we'd BOLO his car.
- Yeah, and he was ready.

17:19.456 --> 17:21.749
Something was parked here
until very recently.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.798
Maybe they saw something.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.471
Hey, Glasser had a switch car
stashed at the warehouse.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.474
I need every camera
in a five-mile radius.

17:38.475 --> 17:41.810
I know the city is on fire,
but this is a priority.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.729
You should pack up.
The air's not safe.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.732
- You're out here.
- I'm looking for somebody.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.235
Did you see him?
- Yeah, a few minutes ago.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.904
What kind of car
was he driving?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.907
I don't know, but he gave
Phil 50 bucks to go with him

17:54.908 --> 17:56.492
to help move something.

17:56.493 --> 18:00.245
I tried to get in on it, but he
said he just needed one guy.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.748
Lucky Phil.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.333
Glasser's got a new victim.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.603
Kylie, are you sure
you're all right?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.605
Yeah, all good.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.775
You disappear for a week,
and when you come back,

18:29.776 --> 18:32.778
some guy is threatening you.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.322
I'm worried about you.
- Don't.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.950
I'm handling it.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.827
I saw his tattoo.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.496
He's with
the Sixth Street Devils.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.622
There was a shooting
about a week ago.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.624
A member of a rival gang
was killed.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.793
That's got nothing
to do with me.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.630
Really? He was shot right
outside the Phoenix Room.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.465
Isn't that where you work?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.720
Please, let me help you.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.306
I don't want you involved.
It's too dangerous.

19:01.307 --> 19:05.811
Kylie, if you're involved,
I'm involved.

19:19.909 --> 19:20.993
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.744
- Kylie, I--
- You didn't--

19:22.745 --> 19:24.079
I'm--I'm sorry.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.540
I-I think maybe I sent
the wrong signals.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.418
Um, I absolutely love my wife.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.630
Sorry.
Um, I'm-- I'm sorry.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.693
Tim, did you hear about the
looting in your neighborhood?

19:54.694 --> 19:55.694
What?
No, what street?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.362
Uh, just south of you,
on Grange.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.572
I got to go.
My nephews are home alone.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.949
I'm coming with you.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.380
Hey, I-I need some advice.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.466
Can it wait?
I'm literally on fire.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.967
No. Yeah, g--go deal
with that.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.928
I-I got this.

20:20.929 --> 20:24.056
- Where's Glasser's wife?
- Uh, over there with the kids.

20:24.057 --> 20:27.392
Glasser's in the wind,
and he has a fresh victim.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.895
Does she really think the
wife is going to talk to her?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.439
No. The human capacity
for self-delusion

20:32.440 --> 20:33.899
never ceases to amaze.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.735
Um, would you want to know

20:36.736 --> 20:39.404
if something was going on
behind your back?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.406
Like if Wesley
was murdering people?

20:41.407 --> 20:43.075
No, more like,
you know, cheating

20:43.076 --> 20:45.077
or just--just being flirtatious
with a colleague.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.578
Well, flirting's harmless,

20:46.579 --> 20:48.497
but physical intimacy
is a hard bright line.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.582
If Wesley so much as kisses
another woman,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.669
I'll be a wealthy,
glamorous widow.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.175
- Where is your husband?
- Protecting his business.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.761
No, he is not--he switched
cars and disappeared.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.263
You are harassing
an innocent man.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.766
Get your head
out of your ass.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.142
Your husband is a psychopath

21:09.143 --> 21:11.853
who is currently on his way
to commit serial murder,

21:11.854 --> 21:13.188
and either you are complicit,

21:13.189 --> 21:15.649
or you are in a pathological
state of denial

21:15.650 --> 21:18.276
about who he really is.
- How dare you?

21:18.277 --> 21:21.363
I do not have time
for your outrage.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.615
If you have any idea
of where he might go--

21:23.616 --> 21:25.283
someplace private,

21:25.284 --> 21:28.036
someplace police wouldn't know
about, you need to tell me.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.372
I don't know anything!
Leave me alone!

21:35.962 --> 21:39.965
Ah, "Undertale."
That is a great game.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.300
It took me forever
to beat Sans.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.890
You know, Detective Harper--

21:48.891 --> 21:51.893
s-she's just really worried
about your dad.

21:51.894 --> 21:56.064
It's really dangerous out there
with the fire.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.817
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.861
I'm not supposed to talk
about it.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.320
You know,
sometimes when people say

22:02.321 --> 22:04.156
something is a secret,
that doesn't mean

22:04.157 --> 22:06.408
you shouldn't be able to tell
grown-ups you can trust.

22:06.409 --> 22:07.868
No.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.995
It's a <i>secret</i> secret.

22:09.996 --> 22:14.000
- Even from the police?
- Especially from the police.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.171
Theo, we're just
trying to find your dad

22:19.172 --> 22:21.090
to make sure he's safe.

22:25.928 --> 22:29.014
My dad has another car.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.849
Really?
What--what kind of car?

22:30.850 --> 22:34.437
A-a van.
It's brown.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.234
Get the hell away from him!

22:41.235 --> 22:43.862
Ma'am, according to your son,

22:43.863 --> 22:46.198
your husband has
a secret vehicle--a brown van.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.366
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.368
He's lying--
traffic camera just captured

22:50.369 --> 22:52.954
Glasser and his victim
in a green Jeep Cherokee.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.250
I'm sorry.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.419
Dad told me one day
the police might be after him,

22:59.420 --> 23:01.379
and if they were,

23:01.380 --> 23:05.384
I should talk about a brown van
and say it was a big secret.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.221
He's using your son
to lie for him.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.807
You okay with that?

23:11.808 --> 23:14.059
That doesn't make sense.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.103
Why would he ask Theo to lie?

23:16.104 --> 23:19.564
It makes perfect sense
if your husband knew

23:19.565 --> 23:22.109
that one day he'd be on the run
from the police

23:22.110 --> 23:23.902
and his son
would be questioned.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.071
Your husband's
a methodical planner.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.074
He spent years grooming
a mental patient

23:29.075 --> 23:32.244
to take responsibility
for his crimes.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.456
So...

23:36.457 --> 23:40.920
all those bodies they found,
Liam did that?

23:43.339 --> 23:44.840
Yes.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.932
I know where he'd go.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.853
There's a house.
No one's ever there.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.856
It's in my mom's name.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.962
Hey, tilt it upwards.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.548
Stop right there.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.634
Hey, officers.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.137
We're just, uh--
we're evacuating.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.222
Oh, you live here?

24:34.223 --> 24:36.224
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're just, uh--

24:36.225 --> 24:38.476
We're packing up
the old family heirlooms, so...

24:38.477 --> 24:40.061
Uh-huh.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.899
If this is your place,
who's that?

24:45.651 --> 24:49.988
God, I am so unlucky.

24:49.989 --> 24:54.159
I just--I mean, what
are the odds, am I right?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.077
Put the TV down.
Show me your hands.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.079
Gently.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.999
Turn around.
Get on your knees.

25:02.585 --> 25:05.003
- Where are the boys?
- What--what boys?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.338
No, that's not fair.

25:19.185 --> 25:23.940
Control, we need transport
for two 4-59 suspects.

25:25.691 --> 25:30.028
Cool.
I told you I heard something.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.196
What is happening?

25:36.285 --> 25:38.119
7-Adam-100,
go to channel 9.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.454
Go for 7-Adam-100.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.206
<i>We have a location
for Glasser.</i>

25:41.207 --> 25:42.707
We are on our way
with Nolan and Miles,

25:42.708 --> 25:44.042
but traffic is terrible.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.210
You are closer.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.878
Can you get
to the Angeles Forest?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.588
<i>I'll send you coordinates.</i>

25:48.589 --> 25:50.423
Yeah, if we approach
from the west,

25:50.424 --> 25:52.592
the Eagle Rock Road entrance
should be clear of the fire.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.594
All right, listen,
we're gonna have to take 39,

25:54.595 --> 25:56.137
but do not wait for us.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.223
He has a victim.
We have to act fast.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.392
Copy.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.645
Okay, thank you.

26:05.314 --> 26:08.233
What is this?
- Areas with looting.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.485
Why isn't it color-coded?
We went over this.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.737
Red for areas with calls
in the 10-plus range,

26:12.738 --> 26:14.406
and blue is for--

26:14.407 --> 26:16.449
- You're still a rookie, right?
- Yeah.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.249
That's not--

26:24.250 --> 26:25.668
Mid-Wilshire.

26:27.712 --> 26:29.087
Okay, got it.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.590
Uh, yeah,
fire changed direction.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.760
Eagle Rock Road, hard closure.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.096
Okay.
Thank you for the update.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.597
Officer Ridley.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.682
Yes, sir.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.642
Did you hang up
on the deputy mayor?

26:42.643 --> 26:45.270
Not--not on purpose, sir,
but I, uh--

26:45.271 --> 26:47.522
Good job.
Keep it up.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.274
I--sir--

26:49.275 --> 26:51.276
I don't have time
for her political games,

26:51.277 --> 26:54.446
so "accidentally" hang up
as many times as it takes

26:54.447 --> 26:56.281
for her to get the message.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.615
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.123
Mid-Wilshire.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.624
Okay.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.127
Um, 101.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.802
<i>It was nice to see the boys.</i>

27:17.803 --> 27:20.138
I miss coaching them.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.141
They bailed on baseball--
all about esports now.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.019
Oh. Well, it's probably
for the best.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.729
Neither of them
could really hit a curveball.

27:27.730 --> 27:30.565
You know, they
asked about you a couple times.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.234
Oh.
Well, what did you say?

27:33.235 --> 27:36.654
Oh.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.823
7-Adam-100,
we have fully engulfed terrain

27:38.824 --> 27:40.492
on Eagle Rock Road.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.163
We need fire and rescue
to Eagle Rock Road.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.207
We are completely blocked off
in both directions.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.167
7-Adam-200 copies the last.

27:51.670 --> 27:56.174
Closest
ground rescue unit's 30 out.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.675
Fire, can you advise?

27:57.676 --> 28:01.012
It'll be over by then.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.223
Can you get to a clearing
or off road?

28:03.224 --> 28:07.185
Uh, the only way off
is down a cliff.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.687
- I'll get someone to you.
- We'll hold out until you do.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.068
We got to get clear
of the shop.

28:15.069 --> 28:16.403
Between the battery
and the gas tank,

28:16.404 --> 28:17.737
this is a bomb
waiting to go off.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.239
Everything here is going
to go up like a match.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.365
I'm gonna grab
the fire shelter.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.117
Have you ever
used one of those?

28:22.118 --> 28:23.618
Uh, I saw a video
on YouTube once.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.703
Ridley, I need LAFD command
on the phone right now.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.622
They need to get a DC-10
to do water drops.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.249
DC-10.
Got it.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.376
Tim and Lucy are pinned down
by the fire on Eagle Rock Road.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.211
Why aren't you
writing this down?

28:33.212 --> 28:35.380
Got it.
Water, Eagle Rock Road.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.381
Thank you.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.128
Is this going to work?

29:15.129 --> 29:16.796
It's designed to reflect
radiant heat,

29:16.797 --> 29:19.424
protect against convective
heat, and trap breathable air,

29:19.425 --> 29:21.468
which is good, but it's
only meant for short-lived--

29:21.469 --> 29:23.678
Yes. Yes is the answer
that I'm looking for.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.513
Yes, it is definitely
going to work.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.851
Listen, I want to tell you
something.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.186
No, no.

29:31.187 --> 29:32.687
What, you got somewhere
you got to be?

29:32.688 --> 29:34.481
God, you are gonna
say something heartfelt

29:34.482 --> 29:35.815
because you think
we're gonna die,

29:35.816 --> 29:37.442
and I don't want
to cry right now.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.444
I might say something
hateful--you don't know.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.279
Yes, I do. I know what you're
going to say.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.282
You're still in love with me.
- Wow, the arrogance!

29:44.283 --> 29:46.826
- Am I wrong?
- No, okay?

29:46.827 --> 29:49.454
No, you're not wrong.
Of course I still love you.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.290
Do you?
- It doesn't matter!

29:52.291 --> 29:54.876
- So that's a yes?
- Oh, you are infuriating!

29:54.877 --> 29:56.503
I know! I know.

30:04.929 --> 30:07.306
That's Glasser's car.
I'll block him in.

30:17.191 --> 30:18.983
Control,
both units are code six.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.568
You're not getting
a signal out.

30:20.569 --> 30:21.819
Fire probably burned out
the repeaters.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.029
If this smoke
gets any thicker,

30:23.030 --> 30:24.572
it could be tough
finding our way back.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.865
Turn on all the
lights on the shop.

30:25.866 --> 30:27.826
Yes, sir.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.083
You guys take the back.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.876
Harper and I will cover
the front.

30:36.877 --> 30:39.254
We'll 8-44 loud as we can so
you know when we're going in.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.089
Copy that.
Give us 30 seconds.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.840
Right.

30:58.107 --> 31:00.066
Police department!
We have a search warrant!

31:00.067 --> 31:03.027
Open the door now!

31:03.028 --> 31:05.029
Police! Open up!

31:16.458 --> 31:18.710
<i>Nolan, we're inside--
downstairs.</i>

31:18.711 --> 31:21.045
<i>We're holding
on a long hallway.</i>

31:21.046 --> 31:23.798
Help!
Please help me!

31:23.799 --> 31:25.925
The police are here!

31:25.926 --> 31:28.261
Keep yelling
so we can find you!

31:28.262 --> 31:29.887
Get back!
Get back!

31:29.888 --> 31:31.139
Someone just ran
down the hall.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.057
Runner, downstairs hallway.
- Help me!

31:33.058 --> 31:34.726
I can--can't see.

31:34.727 --> 31:35.893
- Help!
- It's Glasser. I'm going.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.312
- Clear!
- Help!

31:37.313 --> 31:39.606
- OK.
- Help!

31:39.607 --> 31:40.732
I lost him in the smoke.
Harper, where are you?

31:40.733 --> 31:42.150
Help me, please!

31:42.151 --> 31:44.986
I don't know.
There's just so much...

31:44.987 --> 31:45.987
- He's here.
- Help me!

31:45.988 --> 31:48.906
Get back. Get--

31:48.907 --> 31:50.742
Move in.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.955
Nolan!

31:55.956 --> 31:56.956
Nolan, where are you?

31:56.957 --> 31:59.751
Nolan!

31:59.752 --> 32:02.713
Lopez!

32:11.180 --> 32:14.098
I see you in the shower.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.642
Come out slowly.

32:15.643 --> 32:18.102
Show me your hands.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.812
Help me.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.114
Help me!

32:37.956 --> 32:40.458
I got you, all right?

32:40.459 --> 32:42.043
You're going to be safe,
all right?

32:42.044 --> 32:43.795
I got you. I'm going to get
you out of here.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.713
I'm going to get
you out of here.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.965
All right.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.134
I got you.
I got you.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.303
All right, come on.
Ready?

32:54.139 --> 32:56.307
All right, I got you.
I got you.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.975
I got you, all right?
Let's go.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.144
I got you. I got you.
I got you.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.854
I got you.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.815
You're going to be all right.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.400
<i>We gonna be all right.</i>

33:32.928 --> 33:34.846
Augh!

33:41.729 --> 33:45.106
I found her!
Lopez! Lopez!

33:45.107 --> 33:47.859
Wake up.
Hey, hey, hey, wake up.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.193
Come on.
Wake up.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.403
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

33:50.404 --> 33:51.529
- I'm up. Where's the--
- Get up.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.282
Where--where are we?
Where's Glasser?

33:54.283 --> 33:57.452
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

33:58.746 --> 34:00.872
Glasser's here!
He's down here!

34:14.511 --> 34:17.472
I got Glasser!

34:17.473 --> 34:19.390
Downstairs!

34:39.161 --> 34:40.328
Drop it!

34:40.329 --> 34:41.538
Now!

34:43.415 --> 34:46.001
You're under arrest.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.588
I got ya.

34:50.589 --> 34:57.094
All right.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.976
You're not smiling now,
are you?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.815
Fire's everywhere.
We got to go now, right now.

35:08.816 --> 35:10.275
Move!

35:24.623 --> 35:26.457
I told you we'd make it.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.627
Only because I made you.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.510
I know the water drop
might injure them,

35:37.511 --> 35:40.179
but burning alive
will kill them.

35:40.180 --> 35:43.182
<i>Control, 7-Adam-100,
we are code four.</i>

35:43.183 --> 35:45.226
Hold on.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.520
7-Adam-100, please repeat.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.064
We are code four.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.233
I repeat, code four.

35:52.234 --> 35:55.528
We could use a ride.

35:55.529 --> 35:58.573
Copy that.
Help's on the way.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.190
You got a little something.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.359
Oh, you got dad jokes?
Really?

36:35.360 --> 36:38.446
- You got him.
- Yeah, we got him. It's over.

36:38.447 --> 36:39.864
Congratulations.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.199
I can get
the interrogation room ready.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.201
Well, if someone else wants
to question him, then great,

36:44.202 --> 36:46.370
but I am done for the day.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.372
- Really?
- Yes.

36:48.373 --> 36:51.668
And I am taking
all my vacation days.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.881
Happy to hear it.

37:04.681 --> 37:07.475
Whoa.

37:07.476 --> 37:09.268
Heard you guys
arrested Glasser.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.728
Yeah.
Caught him in the act.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.771
Thought you were on baby duty?

37:11.772 --> 37:13.564
Oh, our sitter
finally showed up.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.275
- Is that glitter?
- Oh, yeah.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.652
You should see the house.

37:17.653 --> 37:19.612
We're going to have to burn it
down, start over.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.447
Mm.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.490
Thank you.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.241
Um, do you got a sec--

37:24.242 --> 37:26.410
Can I talk to you
about something?

37:26.411 --> 37:27.620
Yeah.

37:27.621 --> 37:30.581
You and James,
you're--you're close, right?

37:30.582 --> 37:31.791
Yeah, why?

37:31.792 --> 37:33.793
Well, I, um...

37:33.794 --> 37:37.296
I saw him kissing another woman
earlier at the center.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.465
- No.
- Yeah.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.300
I mean, so I--

37:41.301 --> 37:43.512
I have to tell Harper, right?

37:45.889 --> 37:49.266
I mean, I would give James
a chance to come clean first.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.644
Tell him that you know and give
him 24 hours to tell Harper,

37:51.645 --> 37:53.646
or you will.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.982
You know, he'd probably take
this a lot better

37:55.983 --> 37:58.526
coming from a close friend.
- No.

37:58.527 --> 38:01.821
No, not a chance.
This is your problem.

38:01.822 --> 38:04.281
My problem is, how the hell do
I not tell my wife

38:04.282 --> 38:05.825
about this conversation?

38:05.826 --> 38:07.785
Oh.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.662
Sorry.
- Uh-huh.

38:17.462 --> 38:18.754
<i>♪ There's something
standing ♪</i>

38:18.755 --> 38:21.799
Hey, I thought we were going
to die out there.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.722
Me too.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.306
Having an experience like that

38:29.307 --> 38:32.018
really just crystallizes
your priorities.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.478
It's crazy.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.231
Yeah, my priorities
were already clear.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.900
I keep talking about it,
but I have to--

38:39.901 --> 38:41.861
I have to get serious,
you know.

38:41.862 --> 38:44.363
I need to move forward

38:44.364 --> 38:46.991
in my career.

38:46.992 --> 38:50.494
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I agree.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.913
You know, um...

38:52.914 --> 38:56.709
I've been thinking about taking
the sergeant's exam.

38:56.710 --> 38:59.336
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.839
Well, I mean, if you pass,

39:01.840 --> 39:05.843
then I wouldn't be
your supervisor anymore.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.678
That's a good point.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.889
I hadn't thought of that.

39:09.890 --> 39:12.558
I've got some
excellent books on tape.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.686
I could, uh, help you study.
- Oh.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.397
Well, the test isn't
for another few months,

39:18.398 --> 39:20.441
but it's always good
to get a head start.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.569
Oh, thank God
you guys are okay.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.029
You're--
you're better than okay.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.572
It's like nothing
even happened.

39:26.573 --> 39:28.866
Yeah, smoke inhalation
and, like, a lifetime

39:28.867 --> 39:30.910
of nightmare fuel,
but other than that...

39:30.911 --> 39:33.788
Yeah, good.
Bad, but I--

39:33.789 --> 39:35.706
Good.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.417
Um, yeah, I got into it with
the National Weather Service.

39:38.418 --> 39:39.752
I did some serious yelling.

39:39.753 --> 39:41.754
The fact that they didn't
update us that the fire

39:41.755 --> 39:44.882
had--had shifted is
unacceptable.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.052
I'm sorry. The road wasn't
safe, they didn't tell us?

39:48.053 --> 39:49.970
Yeah.
It's unbelievable, right?

39:49.971 --> 39:52.473
I--somebody's got to get fired
over this.

39:52.474 --> 39:56.060
I'll follow up,
make sure they do.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.729
No, I-I don't think
that's necessary.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.940
I put the fear of God in them.

40:00.941 --> 40:03.067
Um...

40:03.068 --> 40:05.653
anyways, I'm just here--
I'm just checking on my T.O.

40:05.654 --> 40:08.405
I got to get
back to the station.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.825
Grey needs me.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.455
I need to tell you something.

40:16.456 --> 40:20.626
- About the guy who stopped by?
- Connor, yeah.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.336
You were right.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.964
I was at the Phoenix Club
when the shooting happened.

40:24.965 --> 40:27.091
And you saw who did it?

40:27.092 --> 40:29.343
They're going to kill me
if I say anything.

40:31.346 --> 40:34.348
The police can protect you.
- Right.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.641
No, they can, okay?

40:35.642 --> 40:38.602
Look, I know you want
to do the right thing.

40:38.603 --> 40:39.854
Let me help you.

40:39.855 --> 40:41.939
Why are you being so nice
after what I did?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.816
I believe in second chances.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.985
I think I may be on my third
at this point.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.653
I believe in fourth chances.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.698
Look, we can go
to the police station together.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.627
Down! Down!
Get down!
