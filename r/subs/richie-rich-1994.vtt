<i>I still remember it
as if it were yesterday</i>

00:59.174 --> 01:04.887
<i>A cold and frosty November morning
when Master Richie came into the world</i>

01:05.221 --> 01:07.098
I have a son.

01:13.854 --> 01:18.942
<i>And I,
Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury</i>

01:21.069 --> 01:23.488
<i>born in the tradition of service</i>

01:24.405 --> 01:26.741
<i>was to become
his gentleman's gentleman</i>

01:26.908 --> 01:30.953
<i>or as you Americans would say,
his butler</i>

01:31.746 --> 01:37.042
<i>Richie Rich was the long-awaited
first child of Richard and Regina Rich</i>

01:37.209 --> 01:41.755
<i>and at 7 pounds, 6 ounces,
was immediately proclaimed</i>

01:41.922 --> 01:45.133
<i>the wealthiest baby in the world</i>

01:48.344 --> 01:53.808
<i>Truly, Master Richie was born into
a life of great wealth and privilege</i>

01:54.350 --> 02:00.564
<i>and yet, he was assuredly
his parents' most valued treasure</i>

02:03.192 --> 02:05.986
Can you say, "Wall Street"?

02:06.695 --> 02:08.655
"Wall Street"?

02:08.947 --> 02:13.076
- Can you say, "blue chip"?
- Bunches and bunches of money.

02:13.243 --> 02:17.163
- That's how much mommy loves you.
- Can you say, "convertible debenture"?

02:18.331 --> 02:20.541
<i>From the day he left his cradle</i>

02:20.708 --> 02:23.794
<i>I undertook to show him
all that was good in life</i>

02:24.003 --> 02:27.548
<i>And I am delighted to report
that never was there a child</i>

02:27.715 --> 02:29.841
<i>with a sweeter disposition</i>

02:30.509 --> 02:34.346
<i>or a more spirited sense of play</i>

02:35.430 --> 02:38.183
<i>Although his father,
the senior Richard Rich</i>

02:38.349 --> 02:43.187
<i>spent countless hours in his office,
overseeing his vast business empire</i>

02:43.354 --> 02:45.564
Rich to buy 100 million acres of jungle.

02:45.731 --> 02:50.945
<i>he still found time to share
simple pleasures with his son</i>

02:51.111 --> 02:53.572
Thank you, Cadbury.

02:55.532 --> 02:56.908
Go and build it anyway.

02:57.075 --> 03:00.954
<i>As he grew, Master Richie
developed a keen interest in sports</i>

03:01.746 --> 03:04.666
Just a minute. Great toss, son.

03:06.584 --> 03:10.630
<i>- Beep beep, coming through.
- He had everything a boy could want</i>

03:10.796 --> 03:12.423
<i>Although at the age of 3</i>

03:12.590 --> 03:16.677
<i>his driving skills
left something to be desired</i>

03:18.762 --> 03:22.099
We have to have our Arab friends
understand that. Just a minute.

03:22.265 --> 03:24.059
Nice throw, slugger.

03:24.267 --> 03:30.023
<i>With baseball, however, he displayed
a quite precocious talent</i>

03:30.398 --> 03:31.607
Next Tuesday, right.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.655
<i>which, as the years progressed</i>

03:39.657 --> 03:43.494
<i>became more than
just a favorite pastime</i>

03:49.124 --> 03:51.543
Not bad. Let's try this this time.

03:51.751 --> 03:53.711
I want you to get the back elbow up.

03:53.878 --> 03:56.714
That a way. Get the bat right here.
Shoulders square.

03:56.923 --> 03:59.425
Nice level swing.
Keep your eye on the baseball.

03:59.592 --> 04:02.636
okay, pitch. Put some heat on it this time.

04:07.641 --> 04:09.309
That's it.

04:11.019 --> 04:12.771
Nice hitting, Richie.

04:15.774 --> 04:18.026
Sorry, Charles!

04:18.692 --> 04:22.321
Good clubbing, Master Richie.
You're scoring loads of points.

04:22.488 --> 04:24.991
They're called runs, Cadbury. Runs.

04:25.157 --> 04:28.494
of course. But I'm afraid
we must run, sir.

04:28.661 --> 04:31.955
- Can I have just one more inning?
- That really isn't possible.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.918
- Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
- You're welcome, Richie. Any time.

04:37.085 --> 04:38.670
All right, pack it all up.

04:39.462 --> 04:43.466
<i>In addition to his life of fun and games,
of luxury and privilege</i>

04:43.842 --> 04:47.970
<i>Master Richie was obliged to undertake
responsibilities far beyond those</i>

04:48.179 --> 04:51.599
<i>- of any normal child
- It's a great day for a celebration...</i>

04:51.807 --> 04:53.642
...and a great day for United Tool!

04:53.851 --> 04:57.021
We're gonna wait for Mr. Rich
because he said he'd be here.

04:57.187 --> 05:00.983
Today marks a miracle of sorts
here at United Tool.

05:01.191 --> 05:06.696
This factory, once bankrupt,
and 600 jobs about to disappear forever...

05:06.863 --> 05:10.158
...is now celebrating
a new lease on life...

05:10.325 --> 05:14.787
...thanks to billionaire businessman
and philanthropist Richard Rich.

05:14.954 --> 05:19.208
And it looks like Richard Rich
will be arriving here in moments.

05:45.065 --> 05:49.027
Hi. My dad couldn't make it,
so he sent me. I'm Richie.

05:49.194 --> 05:50.946
Fellas, come on. Let me through.

05:51.154 --> 05:55.075
Welcome to United Tools, Richie.
My name is Dave Walter, the plant manager.

05:55.242 --> 05:57.369
This is Diane Koscinski, our union rep.

05:57.577 --> 05:59.704
Diane's gonna be making
our presentation.

05:59.871 --> 06:03.082
- We're really glad you could come.
- Me too. This is Cadbury.

06:03.291 --> 06:06.961
- Master Richie's valet.
- oh, a valet? Never met one of your type.

06:07.128 --> 06:10.214
That doesn't altogether
surprise me, madam.

06:12.549 --> 06:14.051
Richie who?

06:14.259 --> 06:18.388
What planet you been living on?
Richie Rich, the richest kid in the world.

06:20.348 --> 06:24.269
And now, our union rep, Diane Koscinski,
is gonna make our presentation.

06:25.561 --> 06:27.980
Look, Gloria, your mom's
gonna make a speech.

06:28.147 --> 06:31.484
Who cares about speeches?
Let's play some ball.

06:32.777 --> 06:33.944
Fellow workers...

06:34.111 --> 06:36.822
- Gloria, let's go!
- Come on, guys, let's play!

06:37.031 --> 06:39.575
It isn't just this company,
it's the whole town.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.287
And on this special morning...

06:44.454 --> 06:47.874
...the first day of retooling that's gonna
bring our jobs back...

06:49.584 --> 06:51.961
...we're gonna ask Richie to accept...

06:52.128 --> 06:55.214
...a gold-plated socket wrench set
for his dad.

06:57.091 --> 06:59.176
Thank you, Richie.

07:08.477 --> 07:10.937
on behalf of my dad,
thanks for the wrenches.

07:11.438 --> 07:16.150
I know my dad loves socket wrenches.
I know I love socket wrenches.

07:17.235 --> 07:21.322
If my mom knew what a socket wrench was,
I'm sure she'd love it too.

07:26.327 --> 07:29.079
I'd like to stay, but I gotta
go do my homework.

07:29.246 --> 07:30.455
It's been real.

07:32.165 --> 07:34.292
Thank you.
I'm sure you'll all join me...

07:34.459 --> 07:37.962
...in giving Richie a big
United Tools thank-you!

07:38.171 --> 07:42.717
I hope you're hungry. We got wieners
on the grill. Make sure you have partners...

07:42.884 --> 07:47.138
...for that egg toss. Plenty of prizes
and you're gonna win one. You are.

07:47.346 --> 07:50.975
This is a great day, and I hope
you all stick around to enjoy it.

07:51.183 --> 07:54.061
We've got plenty of games,
plenty of contests.

07:54.228 --> 07:56.646
Lots and lots of things for the kids.

07:57.189 --> 07:58.899
Heads up.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.613
This area is not secure, sir.
Please return to the helicopter.

08:05.780 --> 08:06.989
- I wanted...
- I said...

08:07.532 --> 08:09.659
Don't touch him.

08:11.702 --> 08:13.496
Master Richie...

08:13.704 --> 08:17.332
...you have a very busy afternoon,
so we must be on our way.

08:22.087 --> 08:24.130
It's my job to protect him.

08:24.297 --> 08:27.884
very well, Mr. Ferguson,
but grab him like that again...

08:28.051 --> 08:30.261
...and you will need protection.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.232
- Poor kid.
- "Poor kid"? What are you talking about?

08:43.398 --> 08:45.317
He's the richest kid in the world.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.487
You don't have children, do you, Dave?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.117
Hey, it's taking off.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.372
Man, it must be cool
to have everything.

09:02.249 --> 09:04.585
- Come on, let's play ball.
- Yeah, let's go.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.546
Come on, Gloria, put it over. Let's go.

09:07.963 --> 09:12.926
<i>It was then that Richie realized
there was something missing in his life</i>

09:13.093 --> 09:14.803
<i>Something simple</i>

09:15.387 --> 09:18.598
<i>Something money could not buy</i>

09:21.392 --> 09:26.355
Yes, Mrs. Rich, we're flying over
the estate now. We'll be arriving shortly.

09:26.522 --> 09:31.026
What? oh, I'm sure he'll be
very happy to hear the news.

09:31.193 --> 09:34.821
Master Rich, your father is home
from his business trip.

09:34.988 --> 09:36.323
Great.

09:58.969 --> 10:01.096
- Richie.
- Hello, James. Hobbes.

10:01.304 --> 10:02.931
Welcome home, sir.

10:06.267 --> 10:08.770
Dollar! Come here. Come here.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.815
Good. What you doing?
What's going on?

10:13.399 --> 10:15.234
Where's Mom and Dad?

10:17.319 --> 10:19.613
Mount Richmore?

10:20.864 --> 10:23.325
I said we needed
a family portrait, Regina...

10:24.034 --> 10:26.995
...but this?
- It was Rafaella's idea.

10:27.287 --> 10:30.248
She's the artist. I didn't want
to stifle her creativity.

10:30.415 --> 10:32.959
oh, honey, you know me.
I'm all for the arts.

10:33.293 --> 10:35.336
Don't you think
it's a tad pretentious?

10:35.503 --> 10:38.381
our faces 100 feet high?

10:38.548 --> 10:40.633
Wait till Geraldo gets ahold of this.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.718
Richard, dove, you're overreacting.

10:42.885 --> 10:44.762
Say, how'd she get it done so fast?

10:44.929 --> 10:46.180
I've been gone a week.

10:46.347 --> 10:50.517
Professor Keenbean invented a proton
particle maximizer. Something like that.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.769
Anyway, it seems to do the job.

10:52.978 --> 10:54.813
My cheeks are too puffy.

10:55.188 --> 10:58.108
I know, I know, Regina.
I put on a few pounds.

10:58.316 --> 11:01.736
But you have to admit
that I do look puffy up there.

11:01.986 --> 11:05.656
- Dad.
- Hey, slugger. Great to see you.

11:05.906 --> 11:07.700
How you doing, big fella?

11:07.992 --> 11:09.994
How was the ribbon-cutting at United?

11:10.160 --> 11:12.287
- Great. They gave you a gift.
- They did?

11:12.454 --> 11:15.332
- Socket wrenches, sir.
- oh, socket wrenches.

11:15.499 --> 11:17.667
Son, I love a good socket wrench.

11:17.876 --> 11:21.212
Dad, while I was there, there were
these kids playing baseball.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.381
- Baseball? Great.
- Yeah. And so...

11:23.548 --> 11:26.509
Excuse me, sir. It's a telephone call,
the president.

11:26.718 --> 11:28.761
- What country?
- This one, sir.

11:29.720 --> 11:33.349
Probably needs another loan.
This won't take long. I'll be right back.

11:35.684 --> 11:38.020
Mom, I was wondering.

11:38.187 --> 11:40.689
If it's okay,
can I invite some kids over?

11:40.897 --> 11:42.232
of course, dear.

11:42.774 --> 11:48.029
A dinner party. Well, you just tell me who
and when and we'll send out the invitations.

11:48.196 --> 11:52.158
- Not a party, Mom. Just something...
- Informal? All right, then.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.868
More like a buffet.

11:54.118 --> 11:56.871
We can use the oak Room.
That room is large enough...

11:57.079 --> 11:59.707
...to accommodate your friends.
- My friends...

12:00.082 --> 12:02.543
They're always busy.
I don't wanna bother them.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.336
Excuse me, Master Richie.

12:04.503 --> 12:07.631
It's time for your chemistry lesson
with Professor Keenbean.

12:07.798 --> 12:11.259
- Do I have to?
- A schedule, sir, is like a house of cards.

12:11.468 --> 12:13.887
Take one away and they all
come tumbling down.

12:14.846 --> 12:17.390
- Mom?
- I'm afraid so, Richie.

12:17.557 --> 12:19.559
- calculus, well, then, where are we?

12:19.976 --> 12:22.478
<i>In the Rich Manor basement,
you stockholders</i>

12:22.645 --> 12:25.981
<i>are looking at the answer
to the problem of waste management</i>

12:26.148 --> 12:30.569
<i>I, Professor Keenbean here,
with Rich Industries' latest breakthrough:</i>

12:30.736 --> 12:34.739
<i>The subatomic molecular reorganizer!</i>

12:35.240 --> 12:38.743
<i>Useless garbage is broken down
to its basic molecular components</i>

12:38.952 --> 12:42.330
<i>then recombined to form
a whole range of useful new items</i>

12:42.497 --> 12:44.624
<i>from bedpans to bowling balls</i>

12:44.790 --> 12:48.043
<i>Hey, need a new bedpan? I know I do</i>

12:48.252 --> 12:53.757
<i>It's quick, it's easy, and in no time at all</i>

12:53.966 --> 12:58.803
<i>we've taken 15 pounds of yesterday's
garbage and transformed it</i>

12:59.012 --> 13:03.516
<i>into a beautiful new bed...
Bowling ball There's one</i>

13:03.725 --> 13:07.395
<i>Twins And what family doesn't
need a spare?</i>

13:07.562 --> 13:11.148
<i>Here they come Oh, boy, oh, boy</i>

13:11.524 --> 13:12.942
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

13:13.109 --> 13:14.985
Cut, cut, cut.

13:16.779 --> 13:18.864
Still not working, is it, professor?

13:19.031 --> 13:22.325
Still a few kinks need ironing out,
but not to worry.

13:22.492 --> 13:25.954
- You ready for your chemistry tutorial?
- I'm not in the mood.

13:26.496 --> 13:28.498
What else are you working on?

13:29.874 --> 13:31.834
This one will fry your circuits.

13:32.043 --> 13:36.297
I don't mean to play favorites,
but I'm stuck on this one.

13:36.464 --> 13:37.673
It's a new adhesive.

13:37.840 --> 13:42.219
Ten times stickier than
the strongest adhesive known to man.

13:42.386 --> 13:45.264
I call it "Cementia"!

13:45.430 --> 13:47.349
Wait till you see what's over here.

13:47.516 --> 13:50.226
Help me. Help me. Help me.

14:20.546 --> 14:23.591
Hey, Paula! Listen up!

14:23.883 --> 14:26.052
Suck in the cheeks!

14:26.385 --> 14:29.972
- Bad news, I'm afraid, honey.
- Don't tell me you're flying out again.

14:30.139 --> 14:31.849
Tonight after dinner. I'm sorry.

14:32.015 --> 14:34.768
We were supposed
to spend some time together.

14:34.935 --> 14:36.395
How do you put up with me?

14:36.728 --> 14:39.981
Well, you do have $ 70 billion.

14:40.398 --> 14:42.108
Is that the only reason?

14:45.445 --> 14:46.779
No.

14:46.988 --> 14:49.865
You also have a cute butt.

14:55.412 --> 14:56.872
Cadbury, did you hear that?

14:57.039 --> 14:59.875
Indeed, sir. Madam admires your butt.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.626
I'm most delighted for you.

15:06.089 --> 15:09.884
Now, this makes any fabric
instantly impervious.

15:10.093 --> 15:16.098
Dirt proof, stain proof, waterproof, and...

15:16.265 --> 15:18.058
Sherman!

15:21.353 --> 15:23.480
Guess so. Pulled the hair off my head...

15:23.647 --> 15:26.191
Fire in the hole!

15:36.743 --> 15:41.122
And bulletproof. It's not perfect.
It's hell on the dry-cleaning bill.

15:41.330 --> 15:43.040
No kidding.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.167
Nice grouping, Sherman.

15:45.501 --> 15:48.754
- What's this, a bee?
- Nope. That's a paperweight.

15:48.962 --> 15:51.965
This is a bee.

15:53.341 --> 15:58.221
A hundred bees working overtime
couldn't pollinate like this baby.

15:58.638 --> 16:00.682
Behold Robo-Bee.

16:01.474 --> 16:03.643
Here. Take it for a test flight.

16:09.690 --> 16:11.900
Handles like a dream, huh?

16:13.944 --> 16:16.905
Careful. Teams of scientists
have worked day and night...

16:17.072 --> 16:19.824
...developing the latest
in microcircuit technology.

16:19.991 --> 16:21.618
Your afternoon tea, sir.

16:21.993 --> 16:26.164
Millions and millions of dollars
have been spent on this one bee alone.

16:38.550 --> 16:43.513
Come here! Come here, you!
Come! You're gonna need this!

16:59.987 --> 17:04.950
Thirty-seven and a half miles of driveway.
You park in the 5 feet with a puddle.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.160
I'm very sorry, sir.

17:08.036 --> 17:12.499
You're sorry. Well, in that case,
find another job.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.545
Good evening, Mr. van Dough.
It's nice to see you, sir.

17:17.752 --> 17:21.298
I've checked their schedule.
I've got the perfect time...

17:21.464 --> 17:24.510
Not now, moron. We'll talk later.

17:25.386 --> 17:28.513
Thank you very much,
Mr. van Dough, sir.

17:35.145 --> 17:37.856
<i>- Hello?
- Richie, dear</i>

17:38.022 --> 17:40.275
<i>Are you sure you don't want
to dine with us?</i>

17:40.441 --> 17:43.528
It's okay, Mom.
I really don't like that guy.

17:44.111 --> 17:46.197
That's all right, dear. Neither do I.

17:47.239 --> 17:49.283
<i>But foie de veau is very good for you.</i>

17:49.450 --> 17:50.909
Liver is rich in protein.

17:52.703 --> 17:54.246
It's so tasty too.

17:55.914 --> 17:57.416
Bye, Mom.

18:01.294 --> 18:03.963
Laurence, let's get back
to what you were saying...

18:04.130 --> 18:06.799
...about our charitable contributions.
- Yes, sir.

18:06.966 --> 18:09.927
I'm all in favor of charity, sir,
but your donations...

18:10.094 --> 18:13.097
...are costing the corporation
a billion dollars a year...

18:13.264 --> 18:15.641
...and I think it's time we asked ourselves:

18:15.808 --> 18:18.393
- What are we getting for it?
- What are we getting?

18:18.602 --> 18:22.522
We're getting food banks, medical clinics,
shelters for the homeless...

18:22.731 --> 18:25.608
It's Laurence's job
to keep an eye on the bottom line.

18:25.775 --> 18:29.070
Which is also why I have to oppose
the United Tool acquisition.

18:29.237 --> 18:32.281
We should be getting rid
of dead weight, not acquire it.

18:32.573 --> 18:33.908
I agree.

18:34.075 --> 18:38.913
- That's why I am getting rid of United Tool.
- Richard! All those people and their jobs!

18:39.622 --> 18:41.999
That is brilliant.
I should've thought of it.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.960
We buy the company in bankruptcy.
Level the factories.

18:45.294 --> 18:49.130
No, no, Laurence. I'm keeping
the factory open, like I said.

18:49.714 --> 18:51.883
Then we go in and we bust the unions...

18:52.050 --> 18:54.761
...slash benefits,
and then we sell the company.

18:54.969 --> 18:57.472
No. We give it away.

18:57.805 --> 19:01.642
We give it... We give it away.

19:01.809 --> 19:04.520
Absolutely. We modernize it,
of course, and retool.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.189
Then we turn the factory
over to the workers.

19:07.356 --> 19:09.942
Richard, that's a wonderful plan.

19:11.485 --> 19:14.070
Mr. Rich! Mr. Rich!

19:14.321 --> 19:16.781
Mr. Rich. I've done it.

19:17.157 --> 19:21.452
- May I present the Smellmaster.
- Keenbean, that's fantastic.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.704
Richie, come down here and try this.

19:24.455 --> 19:28.209
Glasses help us see better,
and hearing aids help us hear better.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.961
We should have something
to help us smell better.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.547
We do, dear. It's called Chanel.

19:35.674 --> 19:39.386
But the Smellmaster 9000
converts any smell within 20 yards...

19:39.552 --> 19:42.722
...into a digital audio signal.
Here, son. Try it.

19:45.016 --> 19:48.978
<i>Wine, Petite Syrah 1974</i>

19:50.688 --> 19:54.108
<i>Roses Hilversum
Demi-bloom Fresh-cut</i>

19:54.358 --> 19:57.402
- Cool.
- That's marvelous.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.865
<i>Foie de veau. Calves' liver</i>

20:02.032 --> 20:05.076
- Richie.
- Better make some adjustments, Dad.

20:05.285 --> 20:08.872
This thing's way out of whack.
Can I be excused? Thank you.

20:09.205 --> 20:10.957
Come on, Dollar. Traitor.

20:11.416 --> 20:15.628
Sir, this is precisely the sort of thing
I'm talking about. Toys like that.

20:15.878 --> 20:18.506
Toys? Good God, man.

20:18.839 --> 20:20.799
To me, it represents...

20:20.966 --> 20:23.552
...good old-fashioned ingenuity
and know-how.

20:23.719 --> 20:25.387
Right, Keenbean?

20:29.224 --> 20:30.767
Yes, sir.

20:32.894 --> 20:35.521
I see, sir, you bought a new Monet.

20:35.688 --> 20:37.023
- Spectacular.
- Thanks.

20:37.231 --> 20:40.359
Might I suggest you consider
beefing up the security system?

20:40.526 --> 20:44.697
I don't think that'll be necessary.
After all, all of our real valuables...

20:44.905 --> 20:47.616
...are locked in the Rich family vault.

20:47.908 --> 20:49.117
vault?

20:49.618 --> 20:51.078
The family vault?

20:51.912 --> 20:54.039
Someday I'll give you a tour.

20:54.623 --> 20:56.041
I'd like that.

20:56.249 --> 20:58.209
Again, thank you for a lovely evening.

20:59.002 --> 21:00.712
It is our great pleasure.

21:01.045 --> 21:03.714
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:05.049 --> 21:07.384
- Drive carefully.
- Seat belt.

21:11.889 --> 21:15.350
- Morning, Charles.
- Good morning, Billy.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.067
I gotta get another job.

21:54.470 --> 21:57.348
Morning, sir. It's time.

21:57.723 --> 22:01.226
Rise and shine, Master Richie.
Let's not be a slug abed.

22:01.393 --> 22:04.438
You have a very busy schedule
in front of you.

22:04.980 --> 22:07.190
oh, what a beautiful morning.

22:07.649 --> 22:10.860
Come along. You mustn't keep
your personal trainer waiting.

22:11.027 --> 22:14.364
Please tell Arnold I really don't
feel like exercising today.

22:21.454 --> 22:24.999
I hope you don't mind,
but Arnold canceled.

22:25.165 --> 22:28.544
So I'll be filling in today.
My name is Claudia.

22:31.505 --> 22:34.341
And arms to sides. Bend your legs.
Stretch.

22:34.507 --> 22:38.386
And all the way up. And one
more time. Down and back up.

22:38.553 --> 22:41.514
Now stretch to the left. To the right.

22:41.681 --> 22:43.808
one more time.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.519
Cadbury, about Arnold...

22:46.894 --> 22:48.854
Arnold's history, sir.

22:49.230 --> 22:50.939
Now, all the way back down.

22:51.148 --> 22:56.153
Stretch real hard, and up.
And inhale and exhale.

23:11.751 --> 23:13.502
Dadlink on.

23:16.672 --> 23:18.507
Locate Dad.

23:19.216 --> 23:21.385
<i>Hiya, slugger</i>

23:23.053 --> 23:25.847
<i>Locating Dad now</i>

23:26.890 --> 23:32.145
<i>Exact coordinates
will be pinpointed in 11 seconds</i>

23:32.395 --> 23:35.189
<i>10, nine</i>

23:35.648 --> 23:38.275
<i>eight, seven</i>

23:41.737 --> 23:42.696
<i>Four</i>

23:42.905 --> 23:46.533
Mr. President, if the government
spends more money than it takes in...

23:46.742 --> 23:48.368
...it goes into debt.

23:49.452 --> 23:51.788
Excuse me, Mr. President.
It's the Dadlink.

23:51.955 --> 23:54.916
- Dadlink?
- It's my personal communication system...

23:55.083 --> 23:56.876
...to my son. It's a prototype.

23:57.502 --> 23:58.753
<i>Yes, Richie What is it?</i>

23:58.920 --> 24:00.296
Hi, Dad. What you doing?

24:00.463 --> 24:04.300
I'm discussing economic policy
with the president. Is this important?

24:04.466 --> 24:07.553
<i>Well, Dad, I think I'm getting a zit</i>

24:08.011 --> 24:09.680
What do you think?

24:10.097 --> 24:11.598
<i>Could we talk later?</i>

24:11.765 --> 24:15.101
<i>Oh Sure, Dad I'm sorry
I'll see you tonight</i>

24:15.435 --> 24:17.770
<i>- Bye
- See you.</i>

24:17.937 --> 24:19.230
Bye.

24:19.689 --> 24:22.692
Congratulations on the zit, sir.

24:22.859 --> 24:24.568
Thank you, Cadbury.

24:36.163 --> 24:39.040
And I'll collect you after school, as usual.

24:39.207 --> 24:42.043
- Good hunting, sir.
- Thank you, Cadbury.

24:45.338 --> 24:47.924
Let's move on to case study number 12.

24:48.132 --> 24:50.426
Your company is in dire straits.

24:50.801 --> 24:54.430
Sales are down 50 percent
due to stiff price competition.

24:54.638 --> 24:57.349
Dividends are falling.
Stockholders are demanding...

24:57.516 --> 24:59.726
...you step down
as chairman of the board.

24:59.935 --> 25:02.312
Now, here's your problem.

25:02.479 --> 25:05.440
How do you rally the board
of directors to your side...

25:05.607 --> 25:08.193
...and stave off impending bankruptcy?

25:08.651 --> 25:10.194
Reynolds?

25:12.280 --> 25:15.825
I'll have my secretary
get back to you on that one.

25:16.826 --> 25:20.079
Ellsworth, how would you
get the board on your side?

25:22.164 --> 25:23.624
Bribe someone.

25:24.374 --> 25:27.294
Sit down, Ellsworth.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.130
Reginald, what would you do?

25:30.505 --> 25:32.465
What would I do? Simple.

25:32.882 --> 25:35.635
I'd float a rumor
we're the object of a takeover bid.

25:35.843 --> 25:38.346
And as soon as our stock went up, I'd sell.

25:38.554 --> 25:41.849
That's not only unethical,
Reginald, it's illegal.

25:42.725 --> 25:44.518
I'm only 12.

25:45.519 --> 25:47.688
I can't be held legally responsible.

25:48.564 --> 25:50.190
Good point.

25:53.193 --> 25:56.654
Rich, are you and Cuthbert
passing notes again?

25:56.863 --> 25:59.532
- No, sir.
- Cuthbert?

26:15.005 --> 26:17.757
Capital appreciation
is all well and good...

26:17.924 --> 26:20.218
...but not without
a sound growth strategy.

26:20.552 --> 26:23.972
Well, I've only got one word
to say to you: pork bellies.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.723
So, what do you think, Rich?

26:25.973 --> 26:30.061
I think all we ever talk about is money.
We should be having fun.

26:31.312 --> 26:32.688
Money is fun.

26:32.855 --> 26:36.191
All I'm saying is, I'm wondering
if you can come this weekend...

26:36.358 --> 26:37.693
...and hang out.

26:38.068 --> 26:40.779
- Hang out?
- Yeah, like normal kids.

26:40.946 --> 26:44.282
You know, you're really acting weird,
Richie. Anyway, no can do.

26:44.491 --> 26:47.702
I promised my dad I'd go to Tokyo
for a hostile takeover.

26:47.994 --> 26:52.165
- Ellsworth?
- Sorry, trustees' meeting.

26:52.373 --> 26:56.293
Watch your rear, Ellsworth.
First rule of defense.

26:57.419 --> 27:03.300
This is a cappuccino. I asked for a decaf
caffe latte, you incompetent imbecile!

27:03.467 --> 27:05.719
If you can't do the job, you...

27:08.430 --> 27:12.100
First rule of defense, Reg.
Always watch your rear.

27:21.233 --> 27:23.986
Sir, your Latin tutorial has been
moved back an hour.

27:24.153 --> 27:26.238
That gives you time
for a spot of polo.

27:26.447 --> 27:28.073
Then on to your tax law seminar.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.617
oh, and this coming weekend, big treat.

27:30.826 --> 27:35.038
You and your parents are flying to London
to take tea with Her Majesty.

27:36.915 --> 27:38.625
Is something amiss, sir?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.918
My friends are too busy
to hang out...

27:41.085 --> 27:43.004
...and now I'm too busy to hang out.

27:43.171 --> 27:45.798
You must understand
you're being groomed...

27:45.965 --> 27:50.594
...for a life of wealth and responsibility.
Certain sacrifices must be made.

27:51.553 --> 27:53.805
Sacrifices.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.311
Cadbury, I'm changing my schedule.
Bascomb?

27:59.477 --> 28:00.687
- Sir.
- Make a right.

28:00.854 --> 28:03.690
- Yes, sir.
- You...

28:03.856 --> 28:05.942
Come on, pitcher.

28:08.152 --> 28:10.780
You're supposed to hit the ball.

28:10.988 --> 28:12.406
Come on, Gloria.

28:12.615 --> 28:14.783
Cool car.

28:14.992 --> 28:18.120
Hey, guys. Check it out.

28:18.328 --> 28:19.955
Master Richie, please.

28:20.122 --> 28:23.416
You can't play with those children.
I must protest.

28:23.583 --> 28:26.294
Cadbury, chill. I'll be fine.

28:26.711 --> 28:29.881
But they probably haven't
even been vaccinated.

28:30.673 --> 28:32.800
Hi, guys. I'm Richie.

28:32.967 --> 28:36.971
- We know who you are.
- What, no chopper?

28:37.179 --> 28:39.515
Dad hardly ever lets me
take the helicopter.

28:39.682 --> 28:42.351
oh, no chopper to go to school?

28:43.852 --> 28:45.896
- What are you doing?
- I was wondering...

28:46.063 --> 28:48.648
...if maybe I can play with you guys?
- Play?

28:54.529 --> 28:56.489
Not!

28:56.864 --> 28:58.658
Come on. Let me hit.

28:58.866 --> 29:00.910
You probably couldn't
hit a beach ball.

29:01.077 --> 29:02.328
I can hit off of you.

29:06.999 --> 29:10.961
You think you're so hot.
Put your money where your mouth is.

29:11.169 --> 29:15.006
- You mean bet?
- Yeah. Five says she puts you away.

29:15.215 --> 29:17.717
Five? How about 10?

29:18.509 --> 29:22.221
okay. Seems a little steep,
but 10,000 it is.

29:24.390 --> 29:28.102
No, no, no. Not 10,000.
Ten dollars.

29:29.228 --> 29:31.605
Ten dollars. okay.

29:32.147 --> 29:35.025
I was going to McDonald's
with this money.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.361
- Dust him.
- No problem.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.530
Mr. Fancy Pants is going down.

29:40.739 --> 29:44.075
Master Richie, I do think it unseemly
in the extreme...

29:44.242 --> 29:47.203
...for you to take
these... These children's money.

29:47.370 --> 29:51.207
What are you doing?
Asking the old guy for batting tips?

29:51.916 --> 29:54.627
Hit a touchdown, Master Richie.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.133
Come on, Gloria. Right over the plate.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.593
- Strike him out, Gloria.
- Come on, Gloria.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.053
Come on, Gloria!

30:05.261 --> 30:07.931
- Hey, batter, batter, batter.
- Easy money. Come on.

30:08.681 --> 30:11.100
- Strike him out.
- You got it, Gloria.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.394
Fire it in there.

30:19.525 --> 30:22.069
This is a piece of cake.

30:23.987 --> 30:27.157
We got the money in the bag.
Let's go. Come on.

30:29.784 --> 30:32.787
- Burn it in.
- Come on, Gloria.

30:37.458 --> 30:41.962
oh, yes, Master Richie! Yes!

30:42.338 --> 30:44.923
- Yes! Yes!
- oh, man.

30:45.132 --> 30:46.842
There goes my lunch money.

30:47.009 --> 30:48.552
Lucky swing, I guess.

30:48.969 --> 30:51.680
I was wondering if you could
come over to my house...

30:51.847 --> 30:55.100
Pee Wee, give him the money.

30:55.558 --> 30:58.061
- I don't want your money.
- I said, take it.

30:58.353 --> 31:00.438
You don't belong here.

31:08.529 --> 31:12.116
Truly a prodigious blow, Master Richie.

31:46.523 --> 31:47.982
Thank you.

31:48.691 --> 31:53.529
oh, perk up. It won't be long before you're
having tea and crumpets with the queen.

31:53.696 --> 31:55.698
I'd rather eat a hot dog at Wrigley.

31:55.865 --> 31:57.700
So would I, son, so would I.

31:58.033 --> 32:01.412
oh, Richard, you're not
seriously considering...

32:01.578 --> 32:03.830
...giving the queen the Smellmaster?

32:03.997 --> 32:06.666
Why not, Regina?
I think she'd get a kick out of it.

32:06.917 --> 32:10.003
Anything to take her mind off
those children of hers.

32:12.046 --> 32:14.590
Security check's complete, sir.

32:14.757 --> 32:17.093
I hope you and your family
have a great time.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.845
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson, thank you.

32:23.390 --> 32:25.768
- Cadbury?
- Madam?

32:25.934 --> 32:28.145
What's bothering Richie?

32:28.562 --> 32:32.732
He tried to make friends
with some children yesterday.

32:32.899 --> 32:35.610
It wasn't a great success.

32:36.361 --> 32:39.906
- The poor dear.
- Might I make a suggestion, madam?

32:40.073 --> 32:42.575
- Anything.
- Why not let Master Richie...

32:42.742 --> 32:47.621
...stay here? Young gentlemen are apt
to find royal functions a trifle boring.

32:47.788 --> 32:52.042
Whereas here, I could provide
a busy schedule of distractions.

32:53.001 --> 32:56.922
Cadbury, you're a genius.
I'll go tell Richie.

33:04.262 --> 33:06.222
All aboard.

33:18.233 --> 33:20.152
I could live here.

33:20.402 --> 33:22.737
- It's huge.
- You think they got a pool?

33:24.322 --> 33:26.616
It ain't no house. It's a whole 'hood.

33:27.784 --> 33:30.286
- I've seen bigger.
- Are you kidding?

33:30.453 --> 33:33.539
The place probably has got
its own zip code.

33:38.711 --> 33:40.796
Excuse me, Master Richie.

33:41.255 --> 33:45.759
Sensing you were at a loose end,
I've arranged for a little entertainment.

33:46.384 --> 33:49.679
I'm really not in the mood
for the vienna Boys' Choir today.

33:49.971 --> 33:56.269
Sadly, the choir was unavailable, sir.
But I did make other arrangements.

33:59.689 --> 34:00.981
I don't believe it.

34:01.148 --> 34:02.775
All right, come on.

34:02.983 --> 34:05.569
Thanks, Cadbury, I owe you one.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.657
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, rich man.

34:10.824 --> 34:13.076
- Just checking out your crib, here.
- Crib?

34:13.243 --> 34:17.205
I believe that's street slang
for "home," sir. An idiom.

34:17.371 --> 34:19.373
Who you calling an idiom?

34:20.166 --> 34:22.668
And now, if you wish, sir,
luncheon is served.

34:22.835 --> 34:26.464
All right. Food! I like this place.

34:26.672 --> 34:28.882
I hope you didn't go to too much trouble.

34:29.049 --> 34:33.929
Not at all. I prepared a simple,
yet elegant menu...

34:37.681 --> 34:39.309
It sounds delicious.

34:39.976 --> 34:46.357
However, Master Richie was of the opinion
that his guests deserve a break today.

34:51.612 --> 34:54.822
- You have your own McDonald's?
- No way!

34:55.324 --> 34:56.992
- Not bad.
- Wow.

34:57.159 --> 34:59.578
- This is great.
- I want a Big Mac.

34:59.745 --> 35:02.080
I'm doing an analysis of the secret sauce.

35:02.455 --> 35:06.167
Come on, guys, get him.
Get out of my way.

35:06.376 --> 35:09.545
- Nice shot.
- I'll be right back.

35:09.796 --> 35:11.255
Come on.

35:11.422 --> 35:12.840
It's called the Dadlink.

35:13.007 --> 35:16.677
It's practically the only way I talk
to my dad. He's away a lot.

35:16.844 --> 35:19.346
I know what you mean.
My dad lives in California.

35:19.555 --> 35:22.349
If we didn't e-mail,
I'd probably never talk to him.

35:23.308 --> 35:25.894
Give me the ball. Come on.

35:26.061 --> 35:28.355
Man, he'd like this place, though.

35:28.563 --> 35:30.273
Must be cool to have everything.

35:30.440 --> 35:32.233
So you guys wanna play, or what?

35:32.400 --> 35:35.570
Hey, I got an idea.
Wanna try the Kiddipult?

35:35.945 --> 35:37.196
The Kiddipult?

36:05.890 --> 36:08.559
- Unbelievable!
- That was so cool!

36:08.726 --> 36:10.394
That was great!

36:10.561 --> 36:14.398
That was nothing.
You guys wanna play tag?

36:15.107 --> 36:16.566
- Tag?
- Tag?

36:32.832 --> 36:36.919
In the gentle hand of the gardener
lies the hand of God.

36:37.836 --> 36:39.963
- Are you a Sagittarius?
- No, madam.

36:40.130 --> 36:42.007
- Pisces?
- No, madam.

36:42.174 --> 36:44.759
- Leo?
- No. No, I'm a Taurus.

36:44.926 --> 36:48.012
I knew it. The bull.

36:48.179 --> 36:51.724
- Correct, madam.
- oh, look, don't call me madam, okay.

36:51.891 --> 36:55.519
I don't like the connotation.
My name's Diane.

36:55.686 --> 36:57.646
of course, Diane.

36:57.813 --> 37:00.315
And how about you?
You got a first name?

37:00.482 --> 37:03.193
- of course.
- And?

37:03.360 --> 37:04.903
- Herbert.
- Herb.

37:05.070 --> 37:09.032
No, it's Herbert.
I'm not a seasoning.

37:20.042 --> 37:23.629
Do I detect a rising fire sign,
Herbert?

37:25.756 --> 37:29.176
You, Diane, are a Capricorn.

37:29.343 --> 37:31.720
Hey, how did you know that?

37:32.345 --> 37:34.848
Yeah!

37:36.391 --> 37:38.268
oh, yeah!

37:39.018 --> 37:40.812
Yeah!

37:42.146 --> 37:44.982
Man, this is the best day of my life!

37:47.443 --> 37:51.155
- Me too.
- The day's not over yet.

37:51.697 --> 37:53.323
You mean, there's more?

37:54.283 --> 37:56.618
- Your own roller coaster.
- Check it out.

37:56.785 --> 37:59.496
- Awesome!
- It's so big!

37:59.663 --> 38:01.331
That is cool.

38:01.539 --> 38:04.792
My dad gave me this last Christmas.
It's pretty intense.

38:04.959 --> 38:09.547
- Yeah, I just ate.
- You always just ate.

38:11.298 --> 38:15.594
Now, their plane ought to be
about right here by now.

38:19.765 --> 38:25.186
Just about time for me to move
into a much bigger office.

38:27.230 --> 38:30.900
<i>Roger that, center. Billion Dollar One,
over and out.</i>

38:36.072 --> 38:40.200
Would you take over for a while, darling?
I think I'd like some coffee.

38:40.367 --> 38:44.246
Don't go sneaking into those chocolates.
They're reserved for the queen.

38:44.413 --> 38:48.250
Regina, I'm dieting.
The last thing I want is chocolate.

38:55.340 --> 38:56.716
Where are those chocolates?

38:57.008 --> 38:59.677
Up, up, up.

39:03.931 --> 39:06.433
Chocolates. Chocolates.

39:07.392 --> 39:09.561
Smellmaster.

39:13.732 --> 39:16.401
<i>Handkerchiefs Hand-embroidered</i>

39:17.277 --> 39:20.113
<i>Marble egg Fabergé</i>

39:20.613 --> 39:23.241
<i>Trinitrotoluene</i>

39:25.451 --> 39:27.661
I'll tell him you called. Thank you.

39:27.828 --> 39:29.538
open it.

39:32.416 --> 39:36.962
Darling, this one doesn't have a tag.
Do you know what it is?

39:37.129 --> 39:41.174
- No, I don't.
- The Smellmaster says it's trinitrotoluene.

39:41.341 --> 39:45.595
And if my memory serves me right,
trinitrotoluene is the proper name for...

39:46.762 --> 39:48.848
TNT!

39:51.308 --> 39:54.853
- Good God, Regina. It's a bomb.
- Get rid of it!

40:17.458 --> 40:19.460
Richie, this is great!

40:34.390 --> 40:38.436
To the new chairman of Rich Industries:

40:41.021 --> 40:42.148
Me.

40:42.898 --> 40:47.194
Well, it's been a slice. Maybe I'll see you
around sometime, huh?

40:47.361 --> 40:50.030
Yes, you never can tell.

40:50.197 --> 40:54.826
When you get off the embalming fluid,
give me a call, Herbert.

40:59.872 --> 41:02.250
- Thanks a lot for coming over.
- No problem.

41:02.416 --> 41:05.336
Don't forget. Baseball next Wednesday.

41:05.503 --> 41:06.879
- 3:30.
- I'll be there.

41:07.046 --> 41:09.256
Hey, wait. What about our
hundred bucks?

41:09.423 --> 41:12.342
- I said, forget about that, Tony.
- What hundred bucks?

41:12.509 --> 41:16.471
The penguin-looking dude said he'd give us
$ 100 for coming to play with you.

41:16.680 --> 41:21.059
- Gloria, I didn't know that...
- Hey, look. Nobody has to pay us anything.

41:21.226 --> 41:23.353
End of story.

41:23.728 --> 41:26.439
See you later, Richie.
We had a great time.

41:42.412 --> 41:45.040
Master Rich, I really am
most dreadfully sorry.

41:45.248 --> 41:47.584
- Mr. Cadbury!
- Excuse me.

41:58.469 --> 42:00.888
Master Rich...

42:03.390 --> 42:04.808
What?

42:05.100 --> 42:07.310
It's your parents.

42:08.645 --> 42:10.897
<i>- Dadlink on.
- Hiya, slugger</i>

42:11.106 --> 42:14.067
<i>- Locate Dad.
- Locating Dad now</i>

42:15.610 --> 42:17.069
<i>Signal contact: negative</i>

42:20.781 --> 42:22.658
<i>Power increase</i>

42:23.409 --> 42:25.077
<i>Searching</i>

42:26.870 --> 42:29.122
<i>Dad not found</i>

42:31.583 --> 42:33.710
<i>Dad not found</i>

42:35.420 --> 42:37.255
<i>Dad not found</i>

42:39.632 --> 42:42.009
Mr. van Dough, sir?

42:42.176 --> 42:44.011
<i>Fergie, entrez.</i>

42:44.178 --> 42:48.807
I was just thinking that after I plunder
the Rich family vault...

42:48.974 --> 42:53.770
...I think I'd like to buy a country
somewhere.

42:53.937 --> 42:56.898
Something small, not too ostentatious.

42:57.107 --> 43:00.944
Luxembourg, perhaps, or maybe Ecuador.

43:02.487 --> 43:06.282
Sir, it seems we have a slight problem.

43:08.826 --> 43:11.787
The boy wasn't on the plane, sir.

43:12.288 --> 43:15.958
Feculent fool! After all of my
careful planning...

43:18.001 --> 43:19.920
All right.

43:22.172 --> 43:25.383
I got rid of the king and the queen.

43:25.967 --> 43:31.389
I don't think the boy prince
will be any problem at all.

43:33.641 --> 43:36.018
<i>The plane has been missing
more than 12 hours</i>

43:36.185 --> 43:39.980
<i>But despite the biggest air
and sea search in US naval history</i>

43:40.147 --> 43:43.692
<i>there is still no sign of billionaires
Richard and Regina Rich</i>

43:44.151 --> 43:46.945
<i>missing since the apparent crash
of their plane</i>

43:47.112 --> 43:49.489
They're alive, Cadbury. I know it.

43:49.698 --> 43:53.451
And wherever they are, Master Richie,
I'm sure they're together...

43:53.618 --> 43:55.578
...and happy.

43:56.454 --> 43:59.290
Richard, if we ever get out of this...

43:59.457 --> 44:02.918
...l'm gonna soak for a week
in a vat of oil of olay.

44:03.711 --> 44:05.295
Why haven't they found us yet?

44:05.462 --> 44:09.007
Well, probably because
the locator transmitter in the plane...

44:09.216 --> 44:11.510
...is under a mile of water.

44:11.676 --> 44:15.638
Unless we can see a Radio Shack soon,
we can kiss off any chance...

44:15.805 --> 44:17.557
...of getting my Dadlink to work.

44:17.891 --> 44:22.436
There's only one person ruthless enough
to set off a bomb on our plane.

44:22.603 --> 44:25.272
- When I get my fingers...
- We don't know for sure.

44:25.439 --> 44:28.817
oh, Richard, wake up
and smell the seaweed!

44:28.984 --> 44:31.361
You should have fired him years ago.

44:31.570 --> 44:34.948
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I don't intend to start now.

44:35.115 --> 44:36.867
But van Dough...

44:37.409 --> 44:39.953
He thought Richie
was on the plane with us.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.415
Regina, we have to survive...

44:44.582 --> 44:47.460
...if only to warn Richie.
His life is in danger.

44:52.965 --> 44:55.426
Ladies and gentlemen...

44:56.802 --> 45:00.055
...before we begin, I'd like to observe
a moment of silence...

45:00.222 --> 45:03.934
...on the tragic passing
of Mr. and Mrs. Rich.

45:06.102 --> 45:10.106
Now, first order of business:

45:10.773 --> 45:13.734
United Tool.

45:15.111 --> 45:17.655
What do you mean, they closed
the factory?

45:17.821 --> 45:20.824
It just happened. My mom
and everyone else got fired.

45:20.991 --> 45:23.160
I didn't know. You gotta believe me.

45:23.327 --> 45:26.955
<i>Hey, I'm really sorry about your parents,
but can't you help?</i>

45:37.381 --> 45:39.925
I don't know if I can do this, Cadbury.

45:40.134 --> 45:44.054
Remember this...

45:44.263 --> 45:47.015
- What's that mean?
- It means you have the power...

45:47.182 --> 45:48.934
...of your father inside you.

45:49.142 --> 45:51.478
Kind of like, "Trust the Force, Luke."

45:53.521 --> 45:55.690
Exactly, sir.

46:05.825 --> 46:08.494
It's so hard.

46:09.495 --> 46:10.871
Sir?

46:13.123 --> 46:15.834
Mr. Richard Rich Jr. to see you.

46:19.337 --> 46:22.215
Miss Fairchild, I need those memos done
by 3:00 today.

46:22.382 --> 46:24.467
Yes, sir, Mr. van Dough, sir.

46:24.676 --> 46:29.305
Richie, Richie, Richie, Richie...

46:29.972 --> 46:33.225
Allow me to express my heartfelt
sympathies over your loss.

46:33.392 --> 46:35.978
We all loved your mother and father
very much.

46:36.311 --> 46:38.480
My parents are alive.

46:39.106 --> 46:41.650
I pray nightly that they are.

46:41.983 --> 46:46.446
I want you to know we're doing everything
we can to coordinate the search effort.

46:46.905 --> 46:48.656
Please, have a seat.

46:58.249 --> 47:02.711
- So, what have you come to see me about?
- Well, until my parents come back...

47:02.878 --> 47:04.838
...l've taken a...

47:05.172 --> 47:06.715
Sabbatical, sir.

47:07.465 --> 47:09.843
I've taken a sabbatical from school.

47:10.010 --> 47:12.845
You know, so I can be here
and run things.

47:13.012 --> 47:15.890
Run things.

47:16.057 --> 47:20.352
Richie, the job of senior officer...

47:21.270 --> 47:23.022
...of a multi...

47:24.231 --> 47:26.733
National corporation...

47:27.109 --> 47:30.904
...it's very demanding business.

47:31.822 --> 47:35.533
Hours go, well just, way past
your bedtime.

47:35.742 --> 47:39.245
So I think that it's best
to leave this job to...

47:41.414 --> 47:46.085
...an adult who has experience
in these matters. okay?

47:47.044 --> 47:48.295
I don't think so.

47:49.713 --> 47:52.424
By the way, Cadbury,
how much stock do I own?

47:52.591 --> 47:56.052
Until your parents are found, sir,
as the sole heir...

47:56.219 --> 47:58.930
...you own 51 percent of the voting stock.

47:59.097 --> 48:01.975
You're not of legal age
to exercise your voting rights.

48:02.141 --> 48:04.018
But I am, sir.

48:04.185 --> 48:08.564
<i>And under the terms of the Rich estate,
I stand in loco parentis</i>

48:08.731 --> 48:11.984
<i>...and Guardian ad Litem
to Master Richie.</i>

48:12.151 --> 48:17.406
And accordingly, I give him full
proxy power and authority.

48:19.950 --> 48:24.287
And by the way, United Tool stays open.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.998
Fine.

48:29.792 --> 48:32.670
Round one to you, sir.

48:42.971 --> 48:47.058
With the losses in our manufacturing
division, this will necessitate...

48:53.606 --> 48:55.149
Sorry.

48:55.316 --> 48:57.944
Will necessitate
some employee downsizing.

48:58.110 --> 49:00.905
Downsizing. You mean fire people.

49:01.071 --> 49:03.949
Well, call it what you will, Richie.

49:04.116 --> 49:05.993
It is our job to cut the fat.

49:06.160 --> 49:09.204
Mr. van Dough, my father never
fired anybody.

49:09.371 --> 49:12.290
He always said when
people are secure in their jobs...

49:12.499 --> 49:14.542
...they work harder, happier
and better.

49:15.460 --> 49:20.006
So I think if we need to cut the fat,
I say we start right here.

49:31.058 --> 49:32.809
- Good morning.
- Morning.

49:32.976 --> 49:35.270
- Morning. Your messages.
- Morning, Sylvia.

49:35.437 --> 49:37.856
- Morning, Mr. Rich.
- Morning.

49:38.857 --> 49:40.650
Yeah, Marvin, I understand that.

49:40.817 --> 49:44.654
Yes, but if all of our divisions are doing
record-breaking business...

49:44.862 --> 49:47.698
...how come Rich candy bars
are down 12 percent?

49:47.865 --> 49:51.535
oh, come on. Have you ever actually
tasted a Rich bar?

49:57.666 --> 50:01.503
He'll get back to you as soon
as possible, Mr. lacocca. Goodbye.

50:01.711 --> 50:04.964
Richie Rich's office. Yes.

50:06.841 --> 50:08.509
Talk about gumballs.

50:08.676 --> 50:12.471
Richie Rich's office. I'm sorry.
He's not available. He's in conference.

50:12.638 --> 50:15.850
- I'll have him call you.
- Excuse me. We'd like to see Richie.

50:16.016 --> 50:18.560
- And you are?
- Hey, they're free!

50:18.727 --> 50:20.896
- We're his friends.
- We wanna thank him...

50:21.063 --> 50:25.108
...for reopening the factory.
- Mr. Rich is much too busy to see anyone.

50:25.275 --> 50:26.943
But wait, we can...

50:27.110 --> 50:28.612
Richie Rich's office.

50:28.778 --> 50:30.321
Hey!

50:31.114 --> 50:33.825
Excuse me! Somebody help!

50:33.992 --> 50:38.120
- I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
- Get Pee Wee. We're going in.

50:39.163 --> 50:40.331
Come on, let's go.

50:40.498 --> 50:43.542
- I didn't do it.
- Are you all right?

50:45.377 --> 50:49.089
- Richie.
- Gloria? Hey, guys.

50:49.256 --> 50:50.590
Close the door.

50:50.757 --> 50:52.926
I'll have to get back to you, Marvin.

50:53.093 --> 50:57.472
Yeah, my new research and development
team just walked in.

50:57.639 --> 50:59.223
- What?
- What?

50:59.432 --> 51:02.727
And finally, after extensive
and exhausting taste testing...

51:02.935 --> 51:05.479
...by my new research
and development team...

51:05.646 --> 51:07.398
- Hi.
- How you doing?

51:07.565 --> 51:12.528
...l've come to the conclusion that we must
increase our nut proportion by 15 percent.

51:12.736 --> 51:16.406
We simply cannot let our competition
be nuttier than we are.

51:18.992 --> 51:21.828
- Yes.
- That's our idea.

51:34.298 --> 51:35.966
- Come on, guys.
- Excuse me.

51:36.133 --> 51:38.844
Excuse me. Coming through.

51:43.223 --> 51:46.226
All those in favor of my motion?

51:51.522 --> 51:53.816
All opposed?

52:02.991 --> 52:04.534
I hate that kid.

52:04.701 --> 52:08.622
No, no. Clockwise, clockwise.
I said, massage clockwise.

52:08.788 --> 52:11.916
Migraines are bad enough
without your incompetence. Get out!

52:12.083 --> 52:15.086
Yes, sir, Mr. van Dough.

52:15.711 --> 52:20.383
Now, you listen. I want you to put the
revised plan we discussed into action.

52:20.549 --> 52:23.552
And this time, make sure
the gloves come off.

52:24.219 --> 52:28.015
- Gloves, sir?
- It's a metaphor, hamhead.

52:32.269 --> 52:34.020
Well, that's it, honey.

52:34.187 --> 52:38.274
We're out of Perrier. Caviar's gone,
and there's no more Melba toast.

52:38.441 --> 52:41.110
The only thing we've got left
is a bottle of Dom.

52:41.277 --> 52:45.823
And this little packet of Bubblicious.
Richie's favorite.

52:47.116 --> 52:51.161
He's only 12 years old, Richard.
He's just a boy.

52:51.328 --> 52:55.290
Now, Regina, I'm sure whatever happens,
he's going to be just fine.

52:59.085 --> 53:00.628
- oh, my God!
- What is it?

53:00.795 --> 53:03.256
- We're saved! We're saved!
- What? What? What?

53:03.423 --> 53:07.677
My Louis! Darling, my suitcase.

53:11.889 --> 53:16.143
And when my father gets back, I'm sure
he'll be happy to see what we've done.

53:16.310 --> 53:20.647
The profits from every division
have gone up on a record-breaking rise.

53:22.399 --> 53:26.319
- It doesn't give you the right...
- I'm sorry, but this is police business.

53:26.486 --> 53:29.781
- Herbert Cadbury!
- Yes.

53:29.947 --> 53:31.449
You're under arrest.

53:31.616 --> 53:33.075
- Pardon?
- What is this?

53:33.242 --> 53:36.704
You can't just burst in here.
What is the meaning of this?

53:36.871 --> 53:39.331
We received a tip
and searched the Rich mansion.

53:39.540 --> 53:42.960
Bomb parts, detonation devices
found in Herbert Cadbury's room.

53:43.126 --> 53:45.087
- Preposterous.
- You're under arrest...

53:45.253 --> 53:47.047
...for Mr. and Mrs. Rich's murder.

53:47.255 --> 53:51.259
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't worry. I'm sure it's a mistake.

53:51.426 --> 53:53.594
Cadbury! Cadbury!

53:53.970 --> 53:56.556
Richie, police have him now.
Best stay here.

53:56.848 --> 53:59.809
Do you understand that you can stop
these proceedings?

53:59.975 --> 54:03.771
Richie, is it true that Mr. Cadbury
planted a bomb on your parents' jet?

54:03.937 --> 54:05.647
Do you think they were murdered?

54:05.814 --> 54:08.567
- How do you feel?
- What's the future of United Tool?

54:08.734 --> 54:12.279
- Richie!
- Are your parents alive?

54:12.779 --> 54:16.282
- Mr. van Dough!
- We are deeply saddened by this tragic turn.

54:16.449 --> 54:18.701
I'd like to believe in
Cadbury's innocence.

54:18.868 --> 54:22.288
- But evidence points in the other direction.
- Mr. van Dough.

54:22.455 --> 54:27.585
of course, my main concern is that
poor Richie survives this terrible episode.

54:27.793 --> 54:32.089
And having his best interests at heart,
I have petitioned Superior Court...

54:32.297 --> 54:35.509
...to become the boy's legal guardian.

54:35.675 --> 54:37.427
That's all for right now. Thanks.

54:37.636 --> 54:40.638
<i>The court has granted legal guardianship
of Richie Rich</i>

54:40.805 --> 54:44.100
<i>to Laurence Van Dough,
trusted friend of the Rich family</i>

54:44.267 --> 54:48.187
<i>Meanwhile, bail has been denied
to accused murderer, Herbert Cadbury</i>

54:48.354 --> 54:52.608
<i>And believing Cadbury may have had
accomplices, Mr Van Dough dismissed</i>

54:52.816 --> 54:54.818
<i>all employees of the Rich family</i>

54:55.444 --> 54:59.489
<i>The Southside community adoption service
released figures for the last year...</i>

55:05.787 --> 55:09.040
My makeup case.

55:09.207 --> 55:13.294
My dresses, my Karl Lagerfeld,
my Bill Blass.

55:13.461 --> 55:17.381
My tuxedo. Now we can throw
a dinner party.

55:18.424 --> 55:21.426
Well, what do we have...?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

55:21.593 --> 55:23.971
Here's something we can use.

55:24.179 --> 55:27.641
Don't you think this is an odd time
to start shaving your legs?

55:27.849 --> 55:32.478
Don't you understand? This may be the very
thing that will save us. The very thing.

55:32.645 --> 55:35.606
Yes, yes!

55:35.773 --> 55:38.818
Richard, darling, you've been
too long at sea.

55:39.276 --> 55:41.487
<i>Dad not found</i>

55:42.071 --> 55:44.490
<i>Dad not found</i>

55:44.865 --> 55:47.743
<i>Dad not found</i>

55:47.910 --> 55:50.537
Excuse me, Richie.

55:50.704 --> 55:54.124
- Right under that archway.
- What are you doing? What is that?

55:54.290 --> 55:58.544
- Security camera. For your protection.
- My protection?

55:58.711 --> 56:02.256
Yeah. And until further notice...

56:02.423 --> 56:05.926
...l'm afraid I can't let you leave
the grounds of the estate.

56:06.093 --> 56:09.388
After what happened to your parents,
we can't take any chances.

56:09.805 --> 56:11.390
What about the company?

56:11.682 --> 56:15.268
You won't be going
to the office anymore, Richie.

56:16.686 --> 56:21.858
Mr. van Dough will be running
the office from now on.

56:22.525 --> 56:25.778
- Nice doggy.
- Come on, Dollar.

56:39.416 --> 56:43.670
Right there, camera 23.
That position's good. Lock it down.

56:48.633 --> 56:51.135
I don't believe this.

56:51.302 --> 56:54.847
It's like I'm a prisoner, Dollar,
in my own home.

56:58.100 --> 57:02.521
I'm gonna go have a talk with
Mr. van Dough. You stay here. Good dog.

57:09.527 --> 57:14.407
Well, sir, things have turned out
just the way we planned.

57:14.699 --> 57:17.285
You planned, sir.
Just the way you planned.

57:17.451 --> 57:22.498
Well, not exactly. The vault.
Where is the vault?

57:22.665 --> 57:27.336
There must be billions hidden in there.
You're head of security. Where is the vault?

57:27.502 --> 57:31.673
I told you, sir. That's one thing
I was never privy to.

57:33.383 --> 57:37.011
What about the rotund
Professor Keenbean?

57:37.178 --> 57:41.265
Claims he doesn't know.

57:41.474 --> 57:46.520
<i>And you believe him, you idiot
The man is a lying, disgusting toad</i>

57:46.687 --> 57:48.605
<i>About the butler, sir</i>

57:48.772 --> 57:54.444
<i>I've arranged it so Mr Cadbury will soon
be so overcome with guilt and remorse</i>

57:55.278 --> 57:58.323
...he's going to hang himself in his cell.

58:11.669 --> 58:13.629
To the lab.

58:14.296 --> 58:18.258
- They're gonna kill Cadbury?
- They're gonna make it look like a suicide.

58:18.425 --> 58:22.554
- We have to do something. Bust him out...
- Here it is.

58:22.721 --> 58:27.350
- What is it?
- This baby here is the ultimate corrosive.

58:27.517 --> 58:32.230
Don't touch it! I call it
"hydrocloricdioxynucleocarbonium."

58:32.396 --> 58:36.817
The name needs work.
But it'll eat through a Buick.

58:37.484 --> 58:39.445
or...

58:40.195 --> 58:44.491
- Prison bars.
- Exactly.

58:54.751 --> 58:58.004
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

59:02.591 --> 59:03.884
Gin.

59:07.846 --> 59:09.264
Sorry.

59:09.431 --> 59:13.351
What kind of deal is that? I don't need
the money tomorrow, I need it today.

59:13.518 --> 59:16.354
You don't understand. She's my mother.

59:20.024 --> 59:23.694
- Excuse me, sir.
- What do you want?

59:24.403 --> 59:29.366
- Well, what do you want?
- I want you to give this to my uncle.

59:29.575 --> 59:32.077
- Who's your uncle?
- Herbert Cadbury.

59:32.411 --> 59:36.081
Cadbury, huh? Let me see this.

59:39.834 --> 59:41.836
- What's this?
- It's Latin.

59:42.212 --> 59:45.381
Latino? I thought he was English.

59:45.798 --> 59:48.926
- What's this?
- very special toothpaste.

59:51.262 --> 59:54.223
He has really sensitive teeth.

59:58.727 --> 01:00:01.188
- You got 10 minutes to do whatever.
- Thank you.

01:00:01.396 --> 01:00:03.732
Get to it.

01:00:28.004 --> 01:00:31.382
I'm getting out of here. Let's go. Hurry.

01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:37.930
Thank heavens. My teeth
were starting to grow fur.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.521
Talk about extra-strength tartar control.

01:00:51.568 --> 01:00:53.111
"Life in danger."

01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:59.742
"Use toothpaste on bars."

01:00:59.951 --> 01:01:04.872
Life in danger? Really!
How melodramatic.

01:01:12.796 --> 01:01:16.967
Help! officer! Help me! Help!

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:40.280
Never mess with a man
with sensitive teeth.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.431
- Cadbury?
- Richie.

01:02:09.682 --> 01:02:13.394
- You're okay.
- I've been worried sick.

01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:17.732
I do beg your pardon, sir. All that emotion.
Quite out of order.

01:02:17.898 --> 01:02:19.400
Got caught up in the moment.

01:02:19.567 --> 01:02:21.026
- Cadbury.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:21.193 --> 01:02:22.861
- Shut up.
- Thank you, sir.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.571
Look.

01:02:26.615 --> 01:02:30.285
- I'm so sorry. I hadn't heard.
- No, look. They only found the plane.

01:02:30.744 --> 01:02:34.581
No bodies, no life raft.
Mom and Dad are alive. I know it.

01:02:34.748 --> 01:02:37.458
- And the Dadlink?
- We can't go back to the house.

01:02:37.792 --> 01:02:41.212
But I have another idea. Come on.

01:02:42.004 --> 01:02:43.714
Looking radical in those clothes.

01:02:43.881 --> 01:02:46.467
Thank God I was able to hold on to
my underwear.

01:02:53.015 --> 01:02:57.644
So Master Richie helped Cadbury
escape from jail.

01:02:57.811 --> 01:03:01.564
I knew that! I know everything!
Everything, do you hear?

01:03:01.731 --> 01:03:04.317
What I know about you
will put you both in jail!

01:03:04.484 --> 01:03:09.155
Really? In that case, I'm afraid that
we're just gonna have to kill you.

01:03:10.489 --> 01:03:14.618
I don't know that much. What do I know?
Who'd believe me anyway?

01:03:14.785 --> 01:03:17.454
I do believe there is one thing
you do know...

01:03:17.621 --> 01:03:20.540
...which will be very helpful to me.
- Forget it!

01:03:20.707 --> 01:03:26.462
I'm not helping you. Nothing you do can
make me talk! Do you hear? Nothing!

01:03:34.887 --> 01:03:36.514
Good morning, madam.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.766
Cadbury, come on.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.023
This is it, right here.

01:03:51.486 --> 01:03:53.488
- Hello?
- Gloria, it's me.

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.573
Richie?

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:59.035
Whoa. Look who's slumming.

01:04:00.327 --> 01:04:03.122
Gloria, I need to use your computer.
It's important.

01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:05.165
Come on in.

01:04:11.796 --> 01:04:13.840
Well, here goes.

01:04:19.637 --> 01:04:21.389
oh, no.

01:04:21.556 --> 01:04:24.433
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What are you doing? What is it?

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.103
It may just do it. Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:33.942 --> 01:04:36.528
It's working?

01:04:37.445 --> 01:04:40.031
Let's just hope the power holds out.

01:04:40.198 --> 01:04:44.327
- Hope Richie hasn't given up the search.
- Richie? of course he won't.

01:04:44.494 --> 01:04:46.746
- I'm gonna go get changed.
- Changed?

01:04:46.913 --> 01:04:53.043
Yes, of course, darling. There's no way
I'm going to be rescued looking like this.

01:04:58.382 --> 01:05:02.302
- Just a few more seconds. It should be in.
- I like this look on you.

01:05:02.469 --> 01:05:05.513
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were almost normal.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.850
- Thanks. I think.
- No, I mean it.

01:05:09.017 --> 01:05:11.978
I used to think you were just
some spoiled rich kid.

01:05:12.144 --> 01:05:14.563
But now you're not so bad.

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:17.942
Yeah. Likewise.

01:05:18.108 --> 01:05:21.028
No, no, please, madam.
Madam, no, no, no!

01:05:21.195 --> 01:05:23.363
That really isn't...

01:05:25.157 --> 01:05:28.868
- Thank you, madam.
- I told you, don't call me madam.

01:05:29.035 --> 01:05:31.621
Forgive me, Diane.

01:05:32.038 --> 01:05:33.873
Richie did it! He's in!

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:38.961
<i>Hiya, slugger</i>

01:05:47.719 --> 01:05:50.180
What the heck?

01:05:51.806 --> 01:05:54.851
Mike, get me Ferguson.

01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:01.482
Come on, professor. Play nice.

01:06:01.649 --> 01:06:04.068
- Think I'm enjoying this?
- Yes.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.071
But anyway...

01:06:07.655 --> 01:06:10.574
You told me what this machine
could do to a person.

01:06:10.741 --> 01:06:15.120
How would you like to spend the rest
of your life as a bedpan?

01:06:15.287 --> 01:06:18.456
You've gotta believe me!
I don't know where the vault is!

01:06:18.623 --> 01:06:23.961
- And even if I did it, it wouldn't help you!
- Ferguson, wait.

01:06:24.962 --> 01:06:28.341
- Tell me why, professor.
- Because the lock is voice-activated...

01:06:28.507 --> 01:06:30.968
...and only Mr. and Mrs. Rich
can open it!

01:06:31.135 --> 01:06:35.681
Unfortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Rich
have been detained permanently.

01:06:36.932 --> 01:06:40.143
So come up with another way
for me to get into that vault.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.479
Yes, but...

01:06:46.357 --> 01:06:48.276
What?

01:06:49.193 --> 01:06:50.736
What?

01:06:51.028 --> 01:06:52.321
Sir, I have a situation.

01:06:52.655 --> 01:06:54.240
Handle it.

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:57.493
I'm sorry. Hungry, professor?

01:06:58.369 --> 01:07:01.163
- You're despicable.
- Enjoy.

01:07:09.295 --> 01:07:10.880
<i>Locating Dad now</i>

01:07:13.007 --> 01:07:15.384
<i>- Dad found
- They're alive! I knew it!</i>

01:07:18.554 --> 01:07:20.806
<i>Exact coordinates will be pinpointed</i>

01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:25.144
<i>Twelve seconds</i>

01:07:25.727 --> 01:07:27.771
<i>Eleven seconds</i>

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.856
- Ten.
- oh, my God. They're alive.

01:07:31.316 --> 01:07:33.943
- Nine, eight.
- Nine, eight.

01:07:35.361 --> 01:07:36.362
<i>Seven, six</i>

01:07:37.905 --> 01:07:40.158
- Access terminated?
- I've been cut off!

01:07:41.242 --> 01:07:44.662
- They must've pulled the modem!
- But your parents are alive, sir.

01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:48.582
- It proves they're alive.
- I have to get to the Dadlink.

01:07:48.749 --> 01:07:50.626
Mr. van Dough, sir...

01:07:50.792 --> 01:07:54.379
...I think we've found a way
into that vault, after all.

01:07:54.546 --> 01:07:56.339
<i>Dad found</i>

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:02.303
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Wait there. We'll be right down.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.724
Are you entirely convinced
this is a good idea, sir?

01:08:06.891 --> 01:08:10.561
- lf anything goes wrong...
- The Dadlink in my room's our only chance.

01:08:10.728 --> 01:08:14.565
- I'm going.
- Yes, but, Master Richie, please consider...

01:08:14.732 --> 01:08:19.653
Well, I'm wanted for attempted murder,
escaping from jail, blowing up an aircraft...

01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:22.738
...breaking and entering
sounds right up my alley.

01:08:22.906 --> 01:08:25.742
- Let's kick some butt, shall we?
- Let's.

01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:36.919
Well, that's it. It's all up to Richie now.

01:08:37.086 --> 01:08:39.546
Well, then, everything is fine.

01:08:39.712 --> 01:08:41.423
- Richie never lets us down.
- No.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.466
He never would.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.845
Wait, darling, do you hear that?

01:08:48.388 --> 01:08:50.180
Yes. Yes, it is!

01:08:50.348 --> 01:08:54.227
- It's a plane! It's a plane!
- oh, my God! Richard, we're saved!

01:08:54.394 --> 01:08:55.853
oh, Richie!

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.647
- Heroic boy!
- over here! Hello?!

01:08:57.813 --> 01:09:00.399
- Lovely son! Hello!
- Hello?! Plane!

01:09:10.742 --> 01:09:13.118
If any of you wanna turn back,
now's the time.

01:09:13.286 --> 01:09:15.580
No way. We're with you, Richie.

01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:23.004
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.352
Yes.

01:09:40.728 --> 01:09:42.354
The package has arrived.

01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:43.981
Splendid.

01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:48.234
Wait for my signal.

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:03.875
Good grief. Manure?

01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:06.794
- Hey! It's all we could find.
- Yeah.

01:10:07.462 --> 01:10:09.422
very well. Load.

01:10:14.218 --> 01:10:17.554
All right. I'm in position.
You guys all set?

01:10:18.972 --> 01:10:20.307
Eminently.

01:10:22.643 --> 01:10:23.977
I've got a target.

01:10:25.103 --> 01:10:26.438
Ready.

01:10:27.814 --> 01:10:29.733
Wait for it.

01:10:30.275 --> 01:10:31.484
Wait for it.

01:10:33.444 --> 01:10:34.695
Fire!

01:10:39.825 --> 01:10:41.076
We missed.

01:10:41.577 --> 01:10:42.703
Reload! Reload!

01:10:47.416 --> 01:10:48.667
<i>This is Nash</i>

01:10:48.834 --> 01:10:50.836
Nash, I didn't hear that. Come back.

01:10:51.253 --> 01:10:52.379
This is Nash.

01:10:52.545 --> 01:10:54.130
Fire two!

01:10:55.632 --> 01:10:57.258
Somebody's throwing...

01:10:59.677 --> 01:11:01.512
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:04.098
Come back, Nash. Say again.

01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:07.768
- What'd you hit him with?
- Don't ask.

01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:09.186
<i>Nash?</i>

01:11:09.853 --> 01:11:11.772
<i>- Nash?
- Talk to him.</i>

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.231
Come in, Nash.

01:11:14.232 --> 01:11:16.735
Yeah. This is Nash.

01:11:16.902 --> 01:11:18.194
False alarm.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.573
Everything's slicker than snot
on a doorknob.

01:11:22.865 --> 01:11:24.450
Well, I heard it in prison.

01:11:24.617 --> 01:11:25.952
Roger that.

01:11:26.118 --> 01:11:30.206
I think those Twinkies
are starting to rot his brain.

01:11:35.752 --> 01:11:37.421
Spoils of war, man.

01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:04.112
Flashlight.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:08.158
- Are you okay?
- You wouldn't believe what they did to me.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:11.244
- It was inhuman. No! Wait!
- Where's van Dough?

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:14.288
He got a phone call and ran out.
He's not nice person.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:18.834
Cadbury and I have to get up to my room.
We need a diversion to get past the guard.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.878
I think I can whip up something.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.755
- Gloria, you go with him.
- okay.

01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:24.506
- Guys, let's do it.
- Come on!

01:12:29.177 --> 01:12:30.846
Go, go, go.

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:39.854
This should do the trick. Come.

01:12:46.569 --> 01:12:49.279
Hey, this is it. Come on.

01:12:56.536 --> 01:12:59.664
<i>Me! Like your own wife and children,
dozens of them!</i>

01:12:59.831 --> 01:13:02.125
This way, Gloria.
over here. Right there.

01:13:02.292 --> 01:13:05.128
- Give that a turn to the right.
- What are we doing?

01:13:05.294 --> 01:13:07.797
Well, what they need is a diversion.

01:13:07.964 --> 01:13:10.966
This is a combination
of laundry detergent...

01:13:11.133 --> 01:13:14.094
...dish-washing detergent
and bubble bath. Take that off.

01:13:14.261 --> 01:13:17.389
I call it "Sudsational."

01:13:20.225 --> 01:13:21.601
What in the?

01:13:22.269 --> 01:13:23.937
Bubbles?

01:13:28.691 --> 01:13:30.067
What the heck?

01:13:34.488 --> 01:13:36.365
Hey, you guys.

01:13:37.157 --> 01:13:41.245
Mr. Zullo, we have a problem
with the front fountain.

01:13:41.411 --> 01:13:45.165
- Then turn it off, you idiot.
- You heard the man. Go.

01:13:45.582 --> 01:13:46.917
Kill the cameras now.

01:14:06.143 --> 01:14:08.562
You guys go on ahead.
I'll be just a second.

01:14:08.729 --> 01:14:10.063
okay.

01:14:19.113 --> 01:14:20.656
My inventions!

01:14:20.865 --> 01:14:22.700
- What is it?
- I don't know!

01:14:24.952 --> 01:14:26.996
We did it, Mom. They're in there.

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:30.415
All right. Richie, Herbert,
you're on your own.

01:14:33.835 --> 01:14:36.796
Cadbury, look. It's still working.

01:14:37.589 --> 01:14:39.716

01:14:39.883 --> 01:14:42.385
Wait a minute. This isn't right.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.012
It says Dad's here.

01:14:45.179 --> 01:14:46.764
Welcome home, Richie.

01:14:47.807 --> 01:14:49.850
You were even quicker than I thought.

01:14:53.228 --> 01:14:56.481
- Mom! Dad!
- our other guests should be arriving...

01:14:56.815 --> 01:14:58.233
...any moment.

01:15:03.446 --> 01:15:05.782
Hey, man, are you nervous or something?

01:15:05.949 --> 01:15:08.493
- What are you talking about?
- Did you fart?

01:15:08.659 --> 01:15:10.870
- No.
- Man, you cut the cheese.

01:15:11.037 --> 01:15:14.248
- Whoever smelt it, dealt it.
- Whoever denied it, supplied it.

01:15:18.419 --> 01:15:20.754
- What is that?
- I don't know.

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:31.639
Sir.

01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:36.060
- Got them.
- outstanding. Bring them in.

01:15:36.936 --> 01:15:40.356
- Richie, darling, I'm so worried about you.
- Thank you.

01:15:40.523 --> 01:15:44.276
- Why are you doing all this?!
- Yes, Laurence, what are you after?

01:15:45.027 --> 01:15:46.361
The vault, Richard.

01:15:46.653 --> 01:15:48.322
The Rich family vault.

01:15:48.488 --> 01:15:51.449
- Is that what this is all about?
- Yes. Yes, the vault.

01:15:51.616 --> 01:15:54.035
- Where is it?
- There.

01:15:55.662 --> 01:15:57.455
- Where?
- out there!

01:16:04.795 --> 01:16:06.297
Mount Richmore?

01:16:07.715 --> 01:16:10.134
Your vault is an entire mountain?

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:13.345
- Well...
- You really are filthy rich, aren't you?

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:17.307
You take me to that vault right now.

01:16:18.058 --> 01:16:19.350
Just to make sure...

01:16:19.517 --> 01:16:22.895
...l'll have Mr. Ferguson watch
Master Richie until we get back.

01:16:23.062 --> 01:16:24.647
No! Don't hurt Richie!

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.776
If you two cooperate, I promise...

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:32.321
...no one will get hurt.
- I'll be okay, Mom.

01:16:33.781 --> 01:16:35.282
Shall we?

01:16:38.618 --> 01:16:42.414
I will not be held responsible
if that weasel steals my inventions...

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.583
...if they fall into the wrong hands...
Robo-Bee!

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:50.630
My little pretty...

01:16:50.838 --> 01:16:52.590
Let's go! Let's go!

01:16:52.757 --> 01:16:54.091
Come on! Move!

01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:56.677
After all this family's
done...

01:16:56.844 --> 01:17:00.430
I guess I won't be winning
that Employee of the Month award.

01:17:00.764 --> 01:17:02.557
- very funny.
- Keep moving.

01:17:02.724 --> 01:17:04.351
- Move!
- All right, all right.

01:17:05.644 --> 01:17:07.604
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:17:07.771 --> 01:17:09.439
Hey, watch it!

01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:16.070
All right. Everybody in.

01:17:16.237 --> 01:17:19.198
- No. I'm not going in there.
- No way. I'm not going in.

01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:23.202
- Everybody in!
- Sure. Whatever you say. You're the boss.

01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:25.412
St. Peter on a Popsicle stick...

01:17:25.579 --> 01:17:27.873
...he's gonna scramble their molecules.

01:17:28.206 --> 01:17:31.543
Don't panic. Don't panic, Keenbean,
you'll think of something.

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:34.462
What?! What are you gonna think of?

01:17:36.798 --> 01:17:38.466
We're going!

01:17:44.388 --> 01:17:46.223
- Careful...
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:17:47.099 --> 01:17:48.642
All right, watch your heads.

01:17:52.896 --> 01:17:55.732
- Jerk! Let me out!
- Let's see if this thing works!

01:18:00.069 --> 01:18:02.905
- I'm stuck!
- It's the fat man!

01:18:08.411 --> 01:18:11.288
- Keenbean?
- Keenbean! He's here.

01:18:15.584 --> 01:18:17.169
Nice try, professor.

01:18:17.336 --> 01:18:20.088
But you're gonna have to
do better than that!

01:18:22.382 --> 01:18:23.591
Let's...

01:18:23.758 --> 01:18:26.052
...play a little game...

01:18:26.219 --> 01:18:28.262
...with your little friends!

01:18:31.224 --> 01:18:32.683
Ignition!

01:18:41.608 --> 01:18:45.487
Thirty more seconds and you won't
recognize your little friends!

01:18:50.116 --> 01:18:52.619
Don't worry, Richie!
I've got him covered!

01:18:52.785 --> 01:18:54.120
Save us, professor.

01:18:56.622 --> 01:18:58.833
- No!
- Somebody get us out!

01:19:01.377 --> 01:19:03.128
I can't reach the machines!

01:19:12.637 --> 01:19:14.013
Fly, my beauty!

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.141
Fly like you've never flown before!

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:35.116
Eureka!

01:19:35.534 --> 01:19:37.369
Careful, Richie! The Cementia!

01:19:37.994 --> 01:19:39.579
- Thank you, professor.
- Yes.

01:19:39.746 --> 01:19:41.456
- Cadbury...
- Master Richie!

01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:44.375
I've gotta get to Mom and Dad.

01:19:46.168 --> 01:19:47.503
Wait!

01:20:07.647 --> 01:20:09.315
oh, yes.

01:20:10.858 --> 01:20:12.360
Look at that.

01:20:13.194 --> 01:20:14.403
Finally.

01:20:14.695 --> 01:20:16.655
All right, now. open it.

01:20:16.864 --> 01:20:20.033
<i>- Hello, vault.
- Hiya, boss!</i>

01:20:20.367 --> 01:20:22.786
<i>Please state the code for voice check</i>

01:20:22.953 --> 01:20:24.496
open it now. open it!

01:20:47.059 --> 01:20:49.895
<i>- Code accepted
- Thank you, Beavis and Butthead.</i>

01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:16.795
This is incredible!

01:21:16.962 --> 01:21:18.755
This is amazing!

01:21:19.422 --> 01:21:21.549
This is... This is...

01:21:21.758 --> 01:21:22.967
This is junk!

01:21:23.885 --> 01:21:25.094
Junk?

01:21:25.678 --> 01:21:27.596
Bronze dog bones? What?

01:21:28.305 --> 01:21:32.559
Accordions?
Baby pictures, tricycles, kites?

01:21:35.604 --> 01:21:36.813
Bowling trophies?

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.441
- You remember that, darling?
- our first date.

01:21:41.776 --> 01:21:43.319
What is all of this crap?

01:21:43.486 --> 01:21:45.530
These are our priceless possessions.

01:21:45.697 --> 01:21:47.073
Where are the gold bars...

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:52.119
...the diamonds, negotiable bearer bonds,
the money? Where's the money?!

01:21:52.286 --> 01:21:54.038
In banks, where else?

01:21:54.205 --> 01:21:56.332
- And the stock market, real estate...
- No.

01:21:56.498 --> 01:21:58.459
Is this a joke? This is not right.

01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:02.963
Are you telling me there is not one
single solitary gold bar or emerald...

01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:05.966
...or thousand-dollar bill
in this entire mountain?

01:22:06.132 --> 01:22:09.135
I'm sorry, Laurence,
but that's not what we treasure.

01:22:09.969 --> 01:22:11.512
Shoot them now, please.

01:22:14.474 --> 01:22:17.476
What's the matter, Mr. van Dough?
Can't do it yourself?

01:22:17.643 --> 01:22:19.812
- Richie, get out of here!
- It's okay, Mom.

01:22:19.979 --> 01:22:22.022
I don't think he has the guts
to shoot.

01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:23.607
Richie! No!

01:22:24.316 --> 01:22:27.861
Generally, you're right,
but on this occasion...

01:22:28.028 --> 01:22:29.821
...I think I'll make an exception.

01:22:32.532 --> 01:22:33.783
Cool.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.709
You're a dead man!

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:50.632
Let's get out of here!

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.302
- Lock him in, Dad!
- Good idea, son!

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:58.431
<i>- Close vault.
- Closing vault now Have a nice day</i>

01:23:08.691 --> 01:23:09.984
This way!

01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:30.378
Up the ramp, quick.

01:23:31.087 --> 01:23:32.672
oh, my God.

01:23:33.547 --> 01:23:36.383
- It's all right, honey. Don't look down!
- oh, Jesus.

01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:59.071
Don't look down!

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.656
I won't, darling.

01:24:01.407 --> 01:24:02.825
Get down!

01:24:04.201 --> 01:24:05.786
Down, down. Everybody down!

01:24:05.994 --> 01:24:07.746
- He's trying to kill us!
- I know!

01:24:20.299 --> 01:24:22.301
I got you now.

01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:26.347
Stay down!

01:24:27.931 --> 01:24:29.600
Quick! Up we go!

01:24:29.766 --> 01:24:31.935
Not me, you imbecile! Them!

01:24:33.353 --> 01:24:34.938
Beg your pardon.

01:24:36.398 --> 01:24:37.816
That wasn't so difficult.

01:24:39.317 --> 01:24:41.027
- Come on.
- Richard, I'm afraid!

01:24:41.194 --> 01:24:43.613
But you're the bravest woman
I've ever known.

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:47.033
- Now up you go.
- Cut the crap and stop pushing!

01:24:50.202 --> 01:24:51.620
Shit!

01:25:25.652 --> 01:25:28.113
- All right, Richie, come on.
- Come on, Richie!

01:25:29.948 --> 01:25:31.449
Good boy, son.
Good boy.

01:25:31.616 --> 01:25:33.868
Now, don't look down.

01:25:42.751 --> 01:25:44.169
Hang on!

01:25:47.422 --> 01:25:48.673
Richard!

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:57.890
- Richard!
- Mom!

01:26:12.362 --> 01:26:14.990
I've got you! I've got you!
Grab Richie's hand!

01:26:16.241 --> 01:26:17.659
- I got her!
- No!

01:26:17.826 --> 01:26:20.161
- Don't let go of me.
- We won't let you go.

01:26:21.204 --> 01:26:24.540
Now, I won't let you go, dear.

01:26:27.626 --> 01:26:30.379
- I'll swing you into my mouth.
- In your mouth?

01:26:30.546 --> 01:26:32.381
- Your mouth?
- It's large enough.

01:26:34.383 --> 01:26:35.717
- Ready?
- okay.

01:26:35.884 --> 01:26:37.010
one.

01:26:37.219 --> 01:26:38.929
- I can't hold her! Hurry!
- Two.

01:26:39.096 --> 01:26:40.722
- She's slipping!
- once more.

01:26:40.889 --> 01:26:42.140
Three!

01:26:45.977 --> 01:26:47.895
- You okay?
- I made it!

01:26:48.062 --> 01:26:49.730
All right. You're next.

01:26:55.152 --> 01:26:56.570
Give me that!

01:27:04.202 --> 01:27:06.246
<i>Danger Overload</i>

01:27:07.122 --> 01:27:09.082
<i>Danger Overload</i>

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:19.216
oh, my God, my nose!

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.802
I look like Michael Jackson!

01:27:21.969 --> 01:27:23.137
Mom!

01:27:24.847 --> 01:27:26.640
Richie, grab my hand.

01:27:32.812 --> 01:27:34.272
<i>Danger Overload</i>

01:27:42.154 --> 01:27:43.781
<i>Danger Overload</i>

01:27:43.948 --> 01:27:45.824
Forgive me, madam.

01:27:56.585 --> 01:27:57.961
Where are they?

01:27:58.461 --> 01:27:59.921
Thank God!

01:28:01.339 --> 01:28:03.257
Not so fast.

01:28:16.436 --> 01:28:18.939
Please. Please. Help me!

01:28:20.023 --> 01:28:22.400
oh, my God! Help! Please help! Help!

01:28:22.567 --> 01:28:25.695
Dad, I know how you feel
about firing people, but...

01:28:25.862 --> 01:28:28.322
In this case, I think
we can make an exception.

01:28:28.489 --> 01:28:30.825
Mr. van Dough, you're fired!

01:28:30.992 --> 01:28:32.326
Fine, I'm fired...

01:28:37.748 --> 01:28:39.708
Well done, Master Richie!

01:28:39.875 --> 01:28:41.335
Well done!

01:28:41.501 --> 01:28:43.336
Cadbury...

01:28:43.503 --> 01:28:45.255
...everything all right?

01:28:45.422 --> 01:28:47.632
Yes, madam...

01:28:49.175 --> 01:28:51.386
...in a manner of speaking.

01:28:59.185 --> 01:29:01.645
- Go get them, Richie!
- Come on, Richie!

01:29:02.104 --> 01:29:03.939
- Come on, you can do it!
- Richie!

01:29:04.106 --> 01:29:05.691
Come on, Richie!

01:29:06.525 --> 01:29:08.944
Come on, kill that ball!

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:13.073
- Right down the middle!
- Come on! This guy can't hit!

01:29:13.281 --> 01:29:14.908
Knock it out the park!

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.379
Well done! That's the ticket!

01:29:33.258 --> 01:29:34.509
Good hit.

01:29:34.676 --> 01:29:36.177
Shut up!

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.721
Aren't you gonna throw it back?

01:29:44.727 --> 01:29:47.688
Hey, screw. Fetch.

01:29:54.778 --> 01:29:56.863
Not bad, coach.

01:29:57.072 --> 01:29:58.949
You're not so bad yourself, madam.

01:29:59.157 --> 01:30:01.076
Don't call me that.

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:03.453
Richie, you're all right.

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.330
Likewise.

01:30:18.425 --> 01:30:20.552
I must say, Regina...

01:30:20.761 --> 01:30:24.097
...now our son really
is the richest boy in the world.

01:30:24.264 --> 01:30:26.224
He has friends.
