00:24.330 --> 00:30.670
Settsu Mine, Hyogo
1878 (MEIJI ERA 11)

01:02.570 --> 01:04.670
You're really sure he's here?

01:04.670 --> 01:08.270
We've been watching for two months.
There's no mistake.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.010
Let's end this here.

02:02.630 --> 02:04.060
Be very careful.

02:14.940 --> 02:16.180
Over here!

02:53.510 --> 02:54.950
Who are you?

02:54.950 --> 02:55.950
Halt!

03:59.080 --> 04:03.220
Do you believe in hell?

04:09.290 --> 04:12.060
Surely a world like this, awash in blood,

04:13.860 --> 04:16.459
deserves the name hell.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.490
Are you Makoto Shishio?

04:39.120 --> 04:40.820
What if I am?

04:44.330 --> 04:45.660
You know damn well!

04:45.660 --> 04:46.930
Uh-uh.

04:49.130 --> 04:51.600
Don't move from there.

04:53.670 --> 04:56.170
I love that sound!

04:56.840 --> 04:58.840
You bastard!

04:58.840 --> 05:02.010
Why do you think I knew you were coming?

05:07.150 --> 05:11.020
Hajime Saito of the Shogun's
Shinsengumi police.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.620
A traitor...

05:15.160 --> 05:18.030
We both remember the Shogun.

05:18.700 --> 05:22.030
Are you content with
what this world has become?

05:22.700 --> 05:26.640
Take off that new-government uniform.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.310
Come and join us.

05:29.940 --> 05:34.310
We will turn the clock back
to those days of upheaval.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.050
I take orders from no one.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.320
No?

05:41.890 --> 05:43.820
Very well.

05:54.970 --> 05:56.370
Shishio!

06:16.390 --> 06:18.260
Man is born to carnage.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.360
This world itself is hell.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.590
Shishio!

07:07.810 --> 07:13.750
RUROUNI KENSHIN: KYOTO INFERNO

07:19.390 --> 07:23.660
Kyoto is in chaos!

07:23.660 --> 07:26.560
What do the Shogun's police
think they're doing?

07:26.560 --> 07:28.230
Indeed!

07:28.230 --> 07:32.900
At least they shouldn't be
adding to the trouble!

07:32.900 --> 07:34.600
Onward.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.840
Who's that?

07:39.170 --> 07:41.570
Here he comes!

07:46.980 --> 07:48.620
Who are you?

07:49.750 --> 07:51.280
That scar!

07:52.190 --> 07:57.120
My name is not one worth stating.

07:58.430 --> 08:02.800
I walk the streets of Kyoto,
dreaming of a new age

08:02.800 --> 08:06.030
when the Emperor reigns supreme.

08:06.030 --> 08:08.130
Bakkyusai the Killer.

08:10.870 --> 08:13.810
I am he!

08:17.880 --> 08:19.350
What nerve!

08:19.350 --> 08:21.480
We will cut you down!

08:21.480 --> 08:22.780
Have at him!

08:24.720 --> 08:27.190
Why is Battosai the villain?

08:27.190 --> 08:30.720
"Bakkyusai", not "Battosai."

08:30.730 --> 08:32.030
Bakkyusai?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
Hang in there!

09:04.430 --> 09:10.700
Asakusa, Tokyo

09:27.220 --> 09:31.120
You're an old legend now, "Battosai."

10:00.420 --> 10:03.790
Invigorate the Heart

10:09.930 --> 10:11.790
Step in!

10:18.100 --> 10:19.470
Hit him first!

10:22.510 --> 10:23.940
Watch him!

10:23.940 --> 10:25.010
Harder!

10:27.110 --> 10:28.510
Shout out!

10:43.660 --> 10:45.300
We have returned.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.200
We're back!

10:48.200 --> 10:49.300
Hello.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.700
Sensei!

10:53.000 --> 10:55.340
Why won't you teach us?

10:55.340 --> 10:57.510
You're why we came here!

10:57.510 --> 10:59.010
Please!

10:59.010 --> 11:02.810
You're mistaken.
I am merely a guest here.

11:02.820 --> 11:05.150
I am no master of fencing.

11:05.150 --> 11:06.350
But...

11:07.650 --> 11:09.720
The way of the sword has changed.

11:10.490 --> 11:14.390
The motto of the Kamiya Dojo
is "invigorate the heart."

11:15.160 --> 11:19.060
In this new age,
that is what the sword must teach you.

11:20.900 --> 11:25.500
If it's a fight you want,
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's your man!

11:25.500 --> 11:27.070
I don't charge much.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.340
Well?

11:29.340 --> 11:31.180
What do you say?

11:31.180 --> 11:33.680
You want to fight?

11:33.680 --> 11:36.580
Why not show them some stuff?

11:37.850 --> 11:42.750
These days of peace have no need
for my High Heaven style.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.520
Kenshin!

11:44.520 --> 11:45.590
Miss Megumi!

11:45.590 --> 11:48.860
How's the clinic?
Business good?

11:48.860 --> 11:52.730
Doctors don't talk about
"good business," you oaf!

11:52.730 --> 11:54.570
I'll get dinner ready.

11:54.570 --> 11:56.600
Wait. You have visitors.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.940
You're Mr. Himura?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.740
What would you like?

12:05.750 --> 12:07.950
I'm Superintendent Kawaji.

12:07.950 --> 12:12.880
Someone wishes to talk with you.
Would you come with me?

12:12.890 --> 12:17.390
Hey! We're just getting ready
for dinner here.

12:17.390 --> 12:20.790
Who sent you to come
waltzing in here like this?

12:21.430 --> 12:24.960
Toshimichi Okubo, the Home Minister.

12:24.970 --> 12:26.600
Who's that?

12:26.600 --> 12:29.470
The top man in the government, that's who.

12:32.970 --> 12:35.770
Don't go. It'll just be trouble.

12:36.780 --> 12:37.810
Hey...

12:39.580 --> 12:41.950
If he goes, I come with him.

12:42.650 --> 12:45.780
I don't trust you guys
in the new government.

12:51.260 --> 12:52.490
Fine.

12:52.490 --> 12:53.990
Come with us.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.800
I won't be long.

13:10.610 --> 13:14.310
Home Ministry

13:17.150 --> 13:18.320
Excuse us.

13:27.930 --> 13:31.300
It's been a long time, Mr. Okubo.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.840
At last we meet again.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.000
You know him?

13:39.340 --> 13:41.480
I'll come straight to the point.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.040
What is it?

13:48.020 --> 13:50.550
Shishio is plotting in Kyoto.

13:51.620 --> 13:54.350
Shishio? Who's that?

13:54.360 --> 13:57.960
Another assassin.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.190
What?

13:59.200 --> 14:02.830
The successor to Battosai the Killer.

14:05.300 --> 14:09.670
When you laid down your sword
at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,

14:10.170 --> 14:13.740
he was fighting there, too.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.480
He was one of our assassins.

14:34.400 --> 14:40.040
In speed, skills, and quick thinking,
he was a match for you.

14:41.170 --> 14:44.370
However, unlike you,

14:44.370 --> 14:50.410
he cared nothing for the weak,
or for those with him.

14:50.410 --> 14:52.110
Victory!

14:52.720 --> 14:54.750
It's the Emperor's banner!

14:59.760 --> 15:01.960
We've won!

15:11.270 --> 15:13.440
Ruthless ambition.

15:13.440 --> 15:19.580
A wish to rule for which
he will trample over anyone.

15:20.140 --> 15:22.610
That's Shishio.

15:25.580 --> 15:28.250
I've won!

15:41.070 --> 15:43.600
Well done!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.300
We won!

15:45.300 --> 15:46.600
Thanks to you!

15:47.470 --> 15:49.270
You did it!

15:49.270 --> 15:50.440
Well done!

15:54.480 --> 15:57.010
You bastards!

16:04.090 --> 16:05.790
Bastards!

16:12.630 --> 16:15.330
You bastards!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.770
Some of his assassinations were so brutal

16:18.770 --> 16:22.870
they would have brought discredit
on the new government.

16:23.940 --> 16:26.040
We had to eliminate him.

16:27.950 --> 16:32.150
You put down your sword,
and his body was burned.

17:01.050 --> 17:06.520
He should have died, but then it snowed...

18:20.430 --> 18:21.760
He's alive?

18:21.760 --> 18:25.770
He disappeared into the Kyoto underworld.

18:26.430 --> 18:31.500
He's taken in a bunch of
bloodthirsty mercenaries

18:31.510 --> 18:33.940
and formed his own private army.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.280
He has one aim in mind,

18:38.910 --> 18:41.680
to overthrow the new government.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.620
Wait a minute!

18:45.620 --> 18:50.360
He hates the government for a reason.
Why drag Kenshin into this?

18:50.360 --> 18:54.700
He's destroyed every force
we've sent against him!

18:58.370 --> 19:00.340
The only one we can turn to

19:01.370 --> 19:02.700
is you.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.180
Mr. Okubo,

19:11.310 --> 19:13.220
you look worn out.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.890
Building the new age

19:22.390 --> 19:26.630
is much harder work
than destroying the old one.

19:26.630 --> 19:28.460
Enrich the country, strengthen the military

19:29.500 --> 19:34.240
I don't expect an immediate answer
to a request like this.

19:35.910 --> 19:39.240
Will you take a week and think about it?

19:40.910 --> 19:44.410
So, on May 14th, one week from today,

19:47.250 --> 19:49.050
I hope you'll say yes.

19:56.030 --> 19:57.860
That's crazy!

19:57.860 --> 20:00.930
They want Kenshin to assassinate him?

20:00.930 --> 20:02.600
It's not my idea!

20:03.930 --> 20:07.440
They want Kenshin to clean up the mess

20:07.440 --> 20:09.370
that they've made!

20:09.370 --> 20:10.410
Bastards!

20:11.380 --> 20:12.410
Not only that.

20:12.940 --> 20:17.250
You will, of course, be well-rewarded.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.750
And there are certain illegalities
we are prepared to overlook.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.190
For example,

20:24.190 --> 20:27.960
Megumi Takani's acquittal
on an opium charge.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.590
That's bullshit!

20:29.590 --> 20:34.260
If that's how they're pressuring him,
they can hang me first!

20:34.260 --> 20:36.230
Tell me about it!

20:39.970 --> 20:43.810
I won't let you go to Kyoto.

20:58.990 --> 21:02.490
Kioicho, Tokyo

21:02.490 --> 21:08.430
May 14

21:23.680 --> 21:28.790
Without Himura, the nation is lost.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.990
How do you do?

22:06.990 --> 22:07.990
What the...

22:11.700 --> 22:13.900
I have a message from Mr. Shishio.

22:14.530 --> 22:19.710
"If you're thinking of sending
Battosai Himura against me,

22:19.710 --> 22:21.070
"don't waste your time.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.080
"This land will be mine."

22:43.560 --> 22:46.730
There! Now it's clean.

22:46.730 --> 22:49.270
Is this the time for laundry?

22:50.440 --> 22:54.070
Tell them to take that job and shove it.

22:54.070 --> 22:57.610
You really hate
the new government, don't you?

22:58.250 --> 23:00.280
I hate people like that.

23:09.090 --> 23:10.290
Kenshin?

23:12.090 --> 23:14.460
I'm going to Mr. Okubo's now.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.470
Yahiko, will you hang these out?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.140
Maybe I'll come, too.

23:24.140 --> 23:27.970
No, it might get complicated.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.140
I'm best alone.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.330
He's chosen life as a wanderer
who never kills.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.630
He won't leave you and go to Kyoto.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.740
Here he comes.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.880
Let's go.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.610
Ichiro Shimada, samurai!

24:04.610 --> 24:06.480
Tsurahide Cho, samurai!

24:06.480 --> 24:07.750
Villains!

24:15.490 --> 24:18.360
Someone got here before us!

24:22.530 --> 24:24.300
Okubo!

24:41.480 --> 24:42.720
Mr. Okubo...

24:55.730 --> 24:58.400
There were men planning to assassinate him.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.910
We used that.

25:16.590 --> 25:18.920
Was he one of Shishio's men?

25:19.920 --> 25:22.590
This is how Shishio works!

25:24.090 --> 25:28.760
He wreaks havoc using what he learns
from spies he has everywhere.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.930
You never see his hand!

25:33.270 --> 25:35.270
He'll whittle away at us

25:36.110 --> 25:38.940
until the day he rises up.

25:44.950 --> 25:46.450
Come with me.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.470
Who are they?

26:08.640 --> 26:11.310
Officers Shishio killed.

26:13.980 --> 26:15.650
He's taunting us.

26:16.310 --> 26:21.650
He sent them last night,
as if to coincide with today.

27:27.050 --> 27:30.890
I will repeat Mr. Okubo's request.

27:31.890 --> 27:34.560
You are our only hope.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.070
Japan is about to lose its way.

27:43.570 --> 27:45.670
Shishio will seize his chance.

27:48.740 --> 27:49.910
It's war.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.910
See you in Kyoto.

28:10.260 --> 28:12.600
Extra! Extra!

28:12.600 --> 28:15.000
Lord Okubo assassinated!

28:15.500 --> 28:18.940
The Home Minister's been assassinated!

28:32.450 --> 28:37.290
Assassins Kill Home Minister Okubo!

28:48.900 --> 28:50.310
You're back.

28:51.140 --> 28:53.710
Shishio did that.

28:59.310 --> 29:04.820
We cannot let him go on.
I will go to Kyoto.

29:13.660 --> 29:15.330
To kill

29:18.330 --> 29:19.670
Shishio?

29:24.840 --> 29:26.510
Even when you found out

29:29.680 --> 29:32.850
I was Battosai the Killer,

29:33.350 --> 29:35.350
you let me stay at your dojo.

29:41.090 --> 29:42.290
That made me

29:44.530 --> 29:45.690
very happy.

29:51.370 --> 29:55.770
But to those who hate the likes of
Shishio or Battosai,

29:55.770 --> 29:58.710
Battosai is who I remain.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.540
But why?

30:04.610 --> 30:07.220
Why do you have to go?

30:07.780 --> 30:12.220
What do you care
if he hates the government?

30:13.720 --> 30:15.060
Stay here.

30:17.290 --> 30:23.130
Eat with us, practice
with us, laugh with us.

30:24.070 --> 30:30.070
When I swore off killing,
Shishio took my place.

30:30.970 --> 30:33.340
It is my job to stop him.

30:39.850 --> 30:41.220
If you go,

30:44.420 --> 30:47.520
you might fall back into killing.

30:50.930 --> 30:52.930
No one can throw away

30:55.030 --> 30:56.770
his past.

31:09.110 --> 31:10.950
Thank you

31:12.450 --> 31:16.950
and goodbye.

31:20.060 --> 31:21.590
Once again,

31:23.730 --> 31:25.930
I will be a wanderer.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.960
That son of a bitch!

31:59.760 --> 32:01.100
Damn him!

32:01.100 --> 32:02.130
I'll help.

32:03.600 --> 32:07.470
He took off alone and left me!

32:08.270 --> 32:10.310
He doesn't want anyone in his way.

32:12.010 --> 32:13.510
What?

32:13.510 --> 32:16.780
Who'd be in whose way?

32:16.780 --> 32:20.480
Don't start yelling at us!

32:21.120 --> 32:22.990
That's not what I meant.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.330
Kaoru! Why are you acting
like nothing's wrong?

32:30.530 --> 32:32.200
Kaoru!

32:33.130 --> 32:36.470
Of course she's upset, stupid!

32:39.440 --> 32:42.180
You too, Yahiko!

32:42.880 --> 32:44.180
Smarten up!

32:46.810 --> 32:49.310
You shut up!

32:49.320 --> 32:51.850
Damn it!

32:53.490 --> 32:56.190
Hey! Come back here!

33:07.230 --> 33:08.730
This is bullshit!

33:10.070 --> 33:11.740
Damn him!

33:13.240 --> 33:14.240
Damn it!

33:18.410 --> 33:19.750
What do you want?

33:21.250 --> 33:23.420
Battosai Himura.

33:24.750 --> 33:28.250
Word is there's someone
like him around here.

33:28.760 --> 33:32.590
There's no Battosai here.
Out of my way.

33:46.770 --> 33:47.770
Perfect!

33:48.780 --> 33:50.440
You want trouble?

33:50.950 --> 33:52.780
You found it.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.780
Where is Battosai?

33:55.450 --> 33:58.620
Take me and I'll tell you.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.800
Sanosuke!

34:17.310 --> 34:18.870
Sanosuke!

34:41.000 --> 34:44.830
Tell me before you pass out.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.670
Let me think...

35:07.690 --> 35:08.690
Stop it!

35:23.670 --> 35:25.210
Where is Battosai?

35:25.710 --> 35:27.210
Tell me!

35:29.180 --> 35:32.880
I'm just a passing doctor. I don't know.

35:48.730 --> 35:53.070
Odawara, on the Tokaido Highway

36:05.720 --> 36:07.180
He's got a sword!

36:07.190 --> 36:09.920
They were banned years ago!

37:00.310 --> 37:02.610
Battosai's passed Odawara.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.980
He'll come through the village.

37:05.980 --> 37:06.980
Probably.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.490
Let's arrange a welcome.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.890
Could I have my sword back?

38:26.900 --> 38:28.230
How?

38:28.230 --> 38:31.560
It's of no use to anyone but me.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.730
Yeah, sure!

38:33.230 --> 38:37.410
If you're still keeping it
now that swords are illegal,

38:38.310 --> 38:40.240
that means it's valuable.

39:02.030 --> 39:03.100
Hold it!

39:04.900 --> 39:06.570
Give me that!

39:06.570 --> 39:08.440
But it's my sword!

39:14.940 --> 39:16.950
Give it to me, I said!

39:36.970 --> 39:38.070
Wait!

39:40.700 --> 39:42.400
Please tell me

39:44.110 --> 39:45.310
why you want it.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.990
Excuse me.

40:01.630 --> 40:06.160
This sword is a back-blade.

40:08.960 --> 40:13.340
Only the back of the blade is sharp.

40:18.640 --> 40:22.350
So the front won't cut?

40:25.650 --> 40:27.520
My scabbard?

40:34.490 --> 40:35.860
I thank you.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.660
Who are you, anyway?

40:39.660 --> 40:42.160
I am a mere wanderer.

40:42.170 --> 40:44.870
Why is a girl stealing swords?

40:45.670 --> 40:48.670
To pay for a journey.

40:48.670 --> 40:51.270
That is no reason to steal.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.880
Keep your advice!

40:53.840 --> 40:54.880
Who's there?

41:04.360 --> 41:05.360
Help!

41:09.860 --> 41:11.700
Help!

41:11.700 --> 41:14.060
Help my brother!

41:15.470 --> 41:16.570
Brother!

41:20.810 --> 41:23.070
Brother!

41:28.880 --> 41:32.420
Save our village.

41:33.050 --> 41:34.920
What happened?

41:37.590 --> 41:43.760
I'm a constable.
I lost contact with my home village.

41:44.400 --> 41:48.430
I went to see what was wrong.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.610
Shishio found out who I was.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.780
Eiji.

42:03.750 --> 42:04.950
Brother!

42:11.290 --> 42:16.260
Take care of him, will you?

42:16.260 --> 42:17.290
Here's water.

42:21.630 --> 42:22.730
Brother!

42:24.600 --> 42:25.800
Brother!

42:27.310 --> 42:29.140
Brother!

42:29.980 --> 42:31.640
Brother!

42:40.620 --> 42:41.650
This way.

43:28.970 --> 43:30.170
Dad!

43:34.780 --> 43:36.110
Mom!

43:43.980 --> 43:47.390
Dad! Mom!

44:00.070 --> 44:01.470
Animals!

44:02.540 --> 44:04.040
Those animals!

44:07.740 --> 44:09.180
Dad!

44:09.180 --> 44:10.750
Mom!

44:18.920 --> 44:19.920
Animals!

44:21.190 --> 44:22.260
Animals!

44:22.260 --> 44:23.590
Dad!

44:24.430 --> 44:25.930
Mom!

44:39.680 --> 44:42.110
You killed my mom and dad!

44:42.110 --> 44:44.210
I'll kill you!

44:48.620 --> 44:50.050
Who are you?

44:53.460 --> 44:55.220
You want to die, too?

45:03.470 --> 45:05.800
Are you Shishio's men?

45:05.800 --> 45:07.470
What if we are?

45:08.640 --> 45:10.540
Why did you kill those two?

45:12.070 --> 45:17.810
Their son was going to tell the world
about this village.

45:19.720 --> 45:24.490
They took the blame.
The penalty is death.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.660
As an example?

45:33.930 --> 45:35.170
Watch the boy.

45:36.670 --> 45:38.000
Kill him!

47:07.430 --> 47:09.090
Let's bury them.

47:13.600 --> 47:14.600
Wait!

47:18.000 --> 47:19.440
Leave them.

47:21.270 --> 47:25.780
If we cut them down, we will anger Shishio.

47:26.610 --> 47:30.180
We'll be helpless before him.

47:30.680 --> 47:34.120
What are you talking about?
They're from your village!

47:34.720 --> 47:38.690
They should never have gone
against Shishio!

47:40.190 --> 47:41.960
No! Don't do it!

47:42.600 --> 47:43.800
Mom!

47:46.270 --> 47:48.300
Mom! Mom!

47:49.800 --> 47:51.070
Mom!

47:52.810 --> 47:54.140
Mom!

47:59.310 --> 48:01.810
Dad! Dad!

48:03.650 --> 48:06.820
Dad! Dad!

48:13.430 --> 48:16.000
Dad! Mom!

48:16.000 --> 48:19.260
So this is the world that Shishio wants...

48:37.480 --> 48:42.690
Very well done!
Taking all these men by yourself.

48:43.990 --> 48:45.530
So the stories are true,

48:46.490 --> 48:48.200
Battosai Himura.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.030
Himura?

48:52.840 --> 48:54.370
"Battosai?"

48:54.870 --> 48:56.700
Mr. Shishio calls.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.290
Mr. Shishio! Please!

49:37.350 --> 49:40.920
This sword deserves its reputation.

49:41.550 --> 49:42.920
It cuts.

49:51.930 --> 49:53.600
Your visitor is here.

50:05.410 --> 50:07.440
You're Shishio?

50:09.710 --> 50:14.950
At least say "mister,"
even if you had the job first.

50:17.250 --> 50:19.120
Why this village?

50:20.460 --> 50:26.460
You want the whole country,
not a few small places.

50:28.100 --> 50:31.430
The hot spring here is good for my skin.

50:32.040 --> 50:36.810
But without bandages, I scare people away.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.310
So to spare them that,

50:41.610 --> 50:43.810
I made the village mine.

50:45.620 --> 50:47.380
Damn you.

50:47.380 --> 50:51.290
Don't be mad. I'm just kidding.

50:51.290 --> 50:52.820
It's a joke.

50:53.960 --> 50:58.160
Is this revenge for what
the government did?

50:59.800 --> 51:04.840
I don't care about revenge now.
Far from it. I'm grateful.

51:05.940 --> 51:09.140
My injuries taught me a lot.

51:09.140 --> 51:13.980
Trust, and you'll be betrayed.
Drop your guard, and you die.

51:13.980 --> 51:17.510
Kill first, before they kill you.

51:19.480 --> 51:23.350
The strong survive, and the weak die.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.860
Reality, plain and simple.

51:32.360 --> 51:34.700
I will make this country strong.

51:35.330 --> 51:38.870
That is the justice I will bring.

51:39.770 --> 51:41.170
Soon the whole land...

51:41.170 --> 51:44.540
It is not you who sheds blood for justice.

51:52.850 --> 51:55.220
Draw, Makoto Shishio.

51:57.390 --> 51:59.890
I won't allow any more bloodshed

52:01.690 --> 52:05.560
for this thing you call justice.

52:20.510 --> 52:24.380
Sojiro, play with him for me.

52:25.190 --> 52:26.390
May I?

52:29.860 --> 52:33.360
In that case, I don't mind if I do.

52:36.860 --> 52:38.730
What's that sword?

52:40.200 --> 52:41.570
I'm disappointed.

52:42.700 --> 52:47.740
I'll see you in Kyoto.
Come back as the real killer.

52:50.610 --> 52:52.080
You're running away?

52:53.050 --> 52:54.910
That's not nice.

52:55.550 --> 52:59.590
Stick around and let's play.
Mr. Shishio says we can.

53:36.590 --> 53:37.960
What's so funny?

53:38.990 --> 53:41.260
Nothing's funny.

53:41.260 --> 53:42.460
Nothing.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.990
It's a battle of technique.

54:15.130 --> 54:16.830
They're both equally fast.

54:17.870 --> 54:23.000
What will decide the outcome
is that one is happy to kill

54:24.310 --> 54:26.680
and one is not.

54:59.740 --> 55:02.910
Look what you did to this sword!

55:12.760 --> 55:18.090
Have a new sword ready
for the next time we meet.

56:22.930 --> 56:25.830
Now's your chance!

56:25.830 --> 56:30.000
Take revenge for your mother and father!

56:31.170 --> 56:32.340
No!

56:32.840 --> 56:35.170
Stop it!

56:41.480 --> 56:42.510
Kill them!

56:54.430 --> 56:58.530
You will please no one
by soiling those little hands.

57:02.670 --> 57:08.540
The dead wish only that
the living be happy.

57:13.180 --> 57:16.210
In time, those little hands will grow big

57:17.680 --> 57:19.890
and you will be a man.

57:21.690 --> 57:27.890
Do not use your strength to oppress,
like those who serve Shishio.

57:30.200 --> 57:36.730
And do not let fear make you helpless,
like these people of the village.

57:40.910 --> 57:44.240
Be a man who guards his family to the last,

57:46.880 --> 57:49.750
like your brother.

58:42.970 --> 58:46.640
Look what he did
to a Kotetsu Nagasone sword.

58:49.440 --> 58:51.480
I underestimated him.

58:52.280 --> 58:54.950
"Kotetsu Nagasone?"

58:54.950 --> 58:57.820
A swordsman like you doesn't know him?

58:58.620 --> 59:04.160
Most people would give their eye teeth
to have a sword he made.

59:10.800 --> 59:11.830
That's good.

59:12.470 --> 59:14.170
Very good.

59:14.970 --> 59:16.000
Yes!

59:16.970 --> 59:19.340
Excellent!

59:20.810 --> 59:22.480
Welcome back, sir!

59:22.480 --> 59:24.850
Have you done what I wanted?

59:25.480 --> 59:28.350
We have all the weapons you asked for.

59:28.980 --> 59:30.020
Sojiro.

59:31.650 --> 59:33.190
Do something for me.

59:33.760 --> 59:36.160
Anything but pay for that sword.

59:36.160 --> 59:37.860
Summon the Ten Swords.

59:39.500 --> 59:40.700
What?

59:42.160 --> 59:44.870
You mean, at last?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.200
When they arrive,

59:54.510 --> 59:56.210
we go to war.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:12.560
I can't stand this.

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:15.560
Stand what?

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.070
Get down to Kyoto.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.410
Stop pretending.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.080
I'm not pretending.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.750
It is my opinion as a doctor

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:38.420
that while everyone might think
Kenshin is invulnerable,

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:44.090
I think he is a gifted
athlete, but otherwise

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:47.100
he's no different from us.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:52.940
Where one wound might easily heal

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.610
multiple wounds add up.

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.780
And Kenshin's battle
hasn't only just begun.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.280
There's more than guns or swords
that could kill him.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.630
You'll regret it if you wait.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.640
I'm going.

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.470
He'll face more than just Shishio.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.610
But you're still hurt!

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.980
Quiet! I'll heal up on the road.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.820
I'll toughen up.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.820
Wait!

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:46.660
Then take this.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.160
An elixir.

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:59.170
An old family recipe. Take it once a day.

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:01.170
And this.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.680
It's salve.

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.690
Give Kenshin some, too.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.360
Thanks.

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:22.860
But,

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:27.370
you bring it.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.370
It's not my job to heal his wounds.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.550
Right!

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.220
Right!

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.720
I'm on my way!

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:14.310
Kyoto

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.430
Found you!

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:34.600
I almost lost you!

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.610
Have you got a place to stay?

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:42.110
I know a good, cheap inn.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.950
- No, thank you.
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:50.250
I'm Misao Makimachi.
I'm not a villain.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.290
Trust me.

01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:53.090
Come on!

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.300
There it is!

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.300
But...

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.810
I'm back!

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:14.110
Hey!

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:16.110
A guest!

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:17.450
Welcome!

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:18.650
Elder?

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:22.120
I'm back!

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.620
Misao!

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.890
Come here!

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.320
I'll take your things.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.220
Don't be shy.

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:29.820
But...

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.460
He helped me out.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.800
Let him stay, all right?

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.170
We'll charge through the nose!

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:40.640
Just kidding!

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.640
Hello.

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.340
You're welcome here,

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:47.180
Battosai Himura.

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:52.180
Yes.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.850
The Battosai Himura

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.350
Aoshi's looking for.

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.370
Please...

01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:18.840
You've had a long journey.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.210
Thank you.

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:26.550
It's been ten years since
you were in Kyoto, Battosai.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.130
I've always thought

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:43.070
some day we would meet.

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:47.000
I never thought it would
be here, like this.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:49.670
You are?

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.580
I am a ninja, one of the Hidden Watchers

01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:57.080
who was stationed with
the Kyoto Constabulary.

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:00.050
So Miss Misao...

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:01.250
Yes.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.760
The Shogunate assigned me
to gather information

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:13.930
in the guise of an innkeeper,
as you see me now.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.870
When all of you brought down the Shogun,

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.870
this became my living.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.280
But there were those among
the Shogun's servants

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.780
for whom the transition was not so easy.

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:49.630
One of the Watchers
stationed outside Edo Castle

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.300
was Aoshi Shinomori.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:02.580
You remember the two sides agreed
Edo Castle would be surrendered

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.990
and there would be no bloodshed
in Edo itself.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.790
Had that not happened,

01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:16.330
you would probably have encountered him.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.000
You were the two champions of each side.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.670
The Watchers were given
no opportunity to fight.

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.310
And to make sure we wouldn't,
the Shogun's men...

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:41.490
Why are you doing this to us?

01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:47.260
Intruder!

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:53.970
Even though the new government
had offered him a post,

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:59.970
Aoshi still tried to save his men
from death at the Shogun's hands.

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:05.840
Captain!

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.680
So the victors write the history?

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.189
And we're flung into the dark?

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:18.390
Ryujo!

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.130
Shoot them!

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:23.700
Captain! Live on!

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:29.399
Long live the Watchers!

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:37.910
Long may our name live!

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:50.660
With no companions to preserve,
or Shogunate to hate,

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.760
all of his anger and despair

01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:01.069
turned on Battosai Himura,
the greatest fighter of the age.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:11.609
He aims to kill you

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:16.020
and, before the graves
of his dead comrades,

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:20.890
proclaim the Watchers as
the mightiest of all.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.260
And Miss Misao?

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.470
She doesn't know the demon he's become.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.300
She still pines for him.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.140
I understand.

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:49.479
However, I have come to Kyoto

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:54.820
to put an end to Shishio.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:57.160
I see.

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:05.840
After ten years,
Battosai comes back to Kyoto.

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:11.010
I knew there had to be a reason.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.010
The Hidden Watchers network
of informants remains in place.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.190
If you have need of us,
please do not hesitate to ask.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.100
I'll take you up on that.

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.370
Yes?

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:39.370
Could you find someone for me?

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.550
The father of this sword,

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:54.550
Shakku Arai.

01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:59.220
Let's find him right away.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.920
Excuse us.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.250
Another guest.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.260
Make yourself at home.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:35.090
You're here?

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:40.430
Everyone knows who you are.

01:11:51.610 --> 01:11:54.610
Takano, Kyoto Police.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.950
These are Shishio's villages.

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:04.790
The government has abandoned
about a dozen.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.130
They're under Shishio's control.

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:15.770
Where's the army?

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:17.270
They could fix this!

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:18.270
I'm afraid

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:26.140
we cannot afford to show weakness
in the face of the Western powers.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.810
They're just all afraid

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:31.650
they'll end up like Okubo.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:33.990
Then what do we do?

01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:37.660
The way we're going,
we play right into Shishio's hands.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.830
That's exactly the reason
we're all here now.

01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:13.690
Permission to enter!

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.530
That was quick.

01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.040
I only live over in Osaka.

01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:30.040
Take it easy here till the others arrive.

01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:32.210
Yumi...

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.450
So?

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.520
Where's Battosai now?

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.720
Kyoto, we think.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.230
Probably looking for a sword
to replace the one Sojiro broke.

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:54.570
Battosai's sword would have come
from the best swordsmith.

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.040
That means Shakku Arai.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.740
You can always depend on Cho
to know those things.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:09.920
Battosai's a bit of a fool, isn't he?

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:14.590
Trying to get a dead man
to make him a sword.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.610
Shakku...

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:37.280
Shakku Arai, d. 1870

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.510
Himura!

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:43.450
So you're going?

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.460
Without killing anymore,
I will try to preserve

01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:59.640
those who seek to bring about a new age.

01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:07.480
Well, if you find a way,
I sure hope you'll tell me.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.720
A farewell gift.

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:18.990
Try being a swordsman
wearing one of those.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:25.330
Then you'll know
what you're saying is nonsense.

01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:30.570
The blade's

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.730
on the back?

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:38.170
If your head's still full
of that nonsense when it breaks,

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.780
come back to Kyoto and find me again.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.540
Seiku! Someone's here.

01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:17.710
Coming.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.520
Can I help you?

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.390
Mr. Seiku Arai?

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.130
Yes.

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:32.730
I owe your father a great
debt of gratitude.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.570
Learning he has passed away,
I have come with a request.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.240
Could you please make me a sword?

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.420
My father would often say

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:58.090
how his swords would create a new age.

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:06.760
But the truth is that
those swords took many lives.

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.440
You can say it was the times,
and it had to be that way

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.610
but this is the new age.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.950
Killing to change the world...

01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:32.120
The new age no longer requires
those weapons or that logic.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:40.800
Now I make kitchen knives
or things for everyday use.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:47.310
I'm sorry, but I will never make
another sword.

01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:54.310
Very well.

01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:57.650
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.510
Wow! So this is Kyoto!

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:34.690
Hey!

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:36.360
Stop leering!

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.290
That hurt!

01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:41.190
Save that for when you grow up.

01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:42.600
I'm just looking!

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.870
We're here to find Kenshin,
so get looking for him.

01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:48.530
Yeah, I know.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:53.370
Windmills for sale!

01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:58.710
Windmills! Come and get one!

01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:00.280
Look!

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.950
Windmills! Windmills for sale!

01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:21.230
Hey!

01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:24.710
What are you doing?

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:25.910
What's wrong?

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.580
I'm just playing with him.

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:31.750
What's the problem?

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:34.920
He's got lori!

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:42.760
Who would you be?

01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:46.430
Do you wish something of me?

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:52.400
You're Shakku Arai's son Seiku?

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.100
Rumor has it

01:19:56.770 --> 01:20:00.110
that you've still got
the last sword your dad made.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.950
No one's ever used it, right?

01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:08.950
Can I see it?

01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:21.300
What's wrong?

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.300
Mr. Himura!

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:23.970
The police!

01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:25.630
Get the police!

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.470
Our baby!

01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:31.640
Calm down, will you!

01:20:39.650 --> 01:20:41.990
Come on now! Don't cry!

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.150
I'll shut you up soon enough.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.000
Who are you?

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:01.670
Give back the child.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.680
Two scars crossed on your left cheek...

01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:11.350
So you're the famous killer,

01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:14.020
Battosai Himura?

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:18.690
I hear your sword broke.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.530
So you're here for
Shakku's last sword, too?

01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:26.360
What do you mean?

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:32.540
You mean you don't care if I step in here?

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.040
Then get lost.

01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:36.710
Give back the child.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.210
Why?

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:45.050
If I get his last sword
but I can't try it out,

01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:48.390
where's the fun in that?

01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.600
There's a fight going on!

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.270
Fight!

01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:37.770
Call the police!

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:40.270
Aw, just leave them.

01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:42.940
What's going on?

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:46.010
Some ex-samurais are fighting
over in that shrine.

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:48.110
You'd better keep away!

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.120
Come on!

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.790
Draw your damn sword!

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.640
You're good, I'll give you that.

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.310
But this prize is going to cost you!

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.470
Iori!

01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:40.470
Stay back!

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:45.670
Are we done?

01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:50.510
You're going to risk your life
just to save one kid?

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.200
What's that look?

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:12.370
You're pissing me off!

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.040
I killed many

01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:20.940
to bring about a new age.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.540
Are you bragging?

01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:26.880
Be my guest.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.880
Go ahead and cling to
the glories of the past.

01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:34.050
What a loser!

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:38.890
Ten years since struggle and blood
brought us to a new age.

01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:44.900
Now, in a happy home
that knows nothing of war,

01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:51.570
we begin to see a time of peace
in which to raise its children.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:25:00.080
Think what you will, but that child
is the blessing of the new age.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.270
If it costs me my life,

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:23.610
I will take him back.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.120
A real hero of justice, huh?

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.290
My father's last killing swords!

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:09.650
Wait, lori! Just a little bit longer!

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.170
I'll take the chance!

01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:26.000
If anyone can put that sword
to good use, it's him!

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:06.040
Father! Watch over us!

01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:35.810
Damn you!

01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:24.020
Kenshin!

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.460
That hurt!

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.460
Who's that?

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:29.630
Where's his sword?

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.630
Mr. Himura! Take this!

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.620
It's my father's last sword! Use it!

01:28:56.490 --> 01:28:58.660
So there was one!

01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:01.500
That sword will be mine!

01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:07.100
Draw.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.670
We'll have a real fight.
Let's see who wins.

01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:26.690
Well? You're Battosai
the Killer, aren't you?

01:29:27.690 --> 01:29:31.030
My sword's out. Where's yours?

01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:38.870
Fine! If you've forgotten
how good killing feels.

01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:41.540
I'll remind you.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.540
I'll do one right now!

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.540
Iori!

01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:47.370
Iori!

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.210
Wait there.

01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:52.380
I'll cut you into pieces.

01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:56.280
No killing!

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.230
You know,

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.570
you're really good.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.240
Iori!

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.910
Iori!

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:25.250
Iori!

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:31.150
Kenshin...

01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:40.200
Kenshin?

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:56.280
He's not dead.

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:59.950
Kaoru! He didn't kill him!

01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:01.620
That's a back-blade.

01:31:13.630 --> 01:31:15.130
I'm glad!

01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:21.970
Iori!

01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:27.810
Iori!

01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:30.110
Iori!

01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.150
He's fine!

01:31:35.650 --> 01:31:36.820
On your feet!

01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:39.320
Get him up!

01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:43.230
Bring him!

01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:47.330
Walk!

01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:51.140
Kenshin! Are you okay?

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.170
Is that a new back-blade?

01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:57.180
Hey...

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.680
Hey, Kenshin...

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.690
Kenshin...

01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:21.660
Seiku,

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.500
what's this?

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:32.940
The true back-blade.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:37.110
"True?"

01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:42.450
The sword he made for the gods

01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:47.290
out of remorse, mixed
with a tiny bit of hope.

01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:54.790
When you dedicate a sword
to the gods, you forge two.

01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.300
The better one is "true."
You give that to the gods.

01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:06.140
The other one is the "shadow."
You let someone else have that.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:08.140
So...

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.480
Yes.

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:18.150
The one he gave you was the shadow.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.660
Have that sword.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:35.000
Father would have wanted that.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:55.690
"Reluctantly, for years,
I have tempered swords.

01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:01.030
"Not for the world of my son,
but to bring peace for his child."

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.370
Kenshin, I'm coming in.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.540
Did you rest?

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:16.450
Yeah.

01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:17.950
Right, Kaoru?

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.390
Are you angry?

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.060
About me following you to Kyoto?

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.570
Half.

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:39.900
The other half

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.240
relieved.

01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:51.080
Shishio's men are everywhere.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.080
Be very careful.

01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.920
See? I told you.

01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:06.160
When a woman follows a man,
he acts like she's a pest,

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:09.600
but he's still happy about it.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.600
You be quiet. You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:29.290
Shakku,

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:36.290
I'm just like you.
My head's still full of nonsense.

01:36:39.930 --> 01:36:41.630
Thanks for coming out!

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:44.430
I greet the Ten Swords!

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.770
Hoji!

01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:48.140
Take charge.

01:36:56.810 --> 01:37:00.320
Tomorrow, at one minute to midnight,

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:04.320
we make Kyoto an inferno!

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.770
You hear that, comrades?
The time has come at last!

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:21.510
Those lazy fools will feel

01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:23.570
our power to the full!

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.890
You're Cho the Sword Hunter,

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.030
one of Shishio's Ten Swords.

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:18.400
Are you not?

01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:23.900
So what's the big deal?

01:38:24.970 --> 01:38:26.640
What's he planning?

01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:44.260
Tell us and it'll go easier on you.

01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.930
It's time to stop being loyal to Shishio.

01:38:54.430 --> 01:39:00.440
What are you talking about?
I'm not loyal to Shishio.

01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:05.050
He was just a way to get where I wanted.

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.300
The guy you beat up talked.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.140
Shishio's burning Kyoto.

01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:32.970
That's been planned before.

01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:39.650
In the days of the Shogun,
when we raided the Ikedaya.

01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:43.620
We were in time to stop them.

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.960
And Shishio wants to
try the same thing again?

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:52.160
Probably to prove that this government
can't stop them now.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:58.830
But why would Cho just tell you
something that important?

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:06.470
They're a bunch of hoodlums.
There's always one who'll talk.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.510
It's set for tomorrow
at one minute to midnight.

01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:45.550
Shishio is plotting something
for the night of the waning moon.

01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:48.550
Sniff the wind.

01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:53.220
Kyoto, a sea of fire?

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.060
If we allow it,

01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.890
many will die.

01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:04.900
We have deep roots here in Kyoto.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:08.070
He won't get away with it.

01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:10.870
Misao, send pigeons.

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.310
Tell all Kyoto.

01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:13.380
I will.

01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.980
Kurojo, Shirojo,

01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.580
Masugami, Omime.

01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.580
Dress for action.

01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:26.420
We'll show them what
the Hidden Watchers can do!

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.280
The north side!

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.310
Stay in your homes!

01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:20.240
Martial Law is declared for all of Kyoto!

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.080
Kenshin!

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.220
We'll fight, too.

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:05.250
But...

01:44:05.250 --> 01:44:07.750
I made up my mind before I came.

01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:12.060
I'll see this through to the end.

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:15.390
Me, too. You can see what I've learned.

01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:21.100
Let's go.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.110
Don't try too much.

01:44:32.110 --> 01:44:33.350
Stay with them.

01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:39.290
This is a fight to the death.

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.790
A fencing instructor won't help.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.070
Come and fight with us.

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:00.240
Let's go.

01:45:16.290 --> 01:45:17.460
They're here.

01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:31.840
Take your positions.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:46.860
Sojiro.

01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:48.690
Yes?

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:51.530
Remember my souvenir.

01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:54.460
I will.

01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:07.710
Set them off.

01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:09.380
Yes, sir.

01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:53.650
Everybody, be on your guard.

01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:39.700
Riflemen, forward!

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:53.010
On your honor as police officers,
stop them in their tracks!

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.780
All right!

01:48:58.890 --> 01:49:00.390
Burn the place!

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:03.220
Fire!

01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.370
Police!

01:49:16.370 --> 01:49:18.040
Kill!

01:49:18.570 --> 01:49:19.910
Fire!

01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:22.980
Men!

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:23.980
Charge!

01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:27.870
You're getting better.

01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:30.770
I am Yahiko Myojin, samurai of Tokyo!

01:51:38.050 --> 01:51:40.350
Bring fire!

01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:42.620
We know what you're planning!

01:51:56.870 --> 01:52:01.240
Thanks for coming out this late at night!

01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:06.080
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's in town!

01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.880
He's back.

01:52:39.850 --> 01:52:41.210
Go on ahead.

01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.900
Where's Battosai?

01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:06.140
I heard you're sheltering a man
with crossed scars on his cheek.

01:53:08.610 --> 01:53:14.810
You know how hard
Misao's been looking for you?

01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:20.420
She still believes
you're the man you always were.

01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:22.320
That is of no concern.

01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:27.990
He is a valued guest here at the Aoiya.

01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:34.230
Hiding in plain sight, is he?

01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:37.500
Open your eyes, Aoshi.

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.110
What you need is not battle.

01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:46.110
Calm your heart.

01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:48.620
The Shogunate lives!

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:35.130
If you have abandoned
your honor as a Watcher

01:54:35.130 --> 01:54:38.900
to tread the path of blood and carnage...

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:56.350
I will crush you!

01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:42.730
Burn!

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:52.810
No! No!

01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:55.080
Don't kill!

01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:57.080
Don't kill.

01:56:02.890 --> 01:56:03.920
Are you okay?

01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:27.680
Fire! Put it out!

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.180
We'll take over here.

01:56:35.850 --> 01:56:36.920
Please.

01:56:42.190 --> 01:56:43.530
Hold still.

01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:02.280
Shishio!

01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:24.970
Decoys.

01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:18.620
Kenshin!

01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:20.790
Where are you?

01:58:24.970 --> 01:58:26.630
Wait for me!

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:40.310
Give me a fight, damn it!

01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:43.320
Misao!

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:45.650
What?

01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:47.990
It's Elder and Aoshi!

01:58:48.490 --> 01:58:50.320
Aoshi's come back?

01:59:21.690 --> 01:59:23.520
Where's Battosai?

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.200
That again?

02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.740
Aoshi!

02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:13.910
Stay back!

02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:36.430
Damn you, Aoshi.

02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:42.600
Is that how low

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:47.780
you've sunk?

02:01:27.890 --> 02:01:30.750
I am not the Aoshi you once knew.

02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:29.580
Hey!

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:34.690
All you underlings, get outta here!

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:46.530
Sanosuke?

02:02:47.230 --> 02:02:48.370
Why are you here?

02:02:52.170 --> 02:02:53.200
"Why?"

02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:57.380
To help you out, stupid!

02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:05.380
Thank you.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:13.060
All right, then.

02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:16.460
Victory is ours!

02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:17.460
Who are they?

02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:20.570
Get them all!

02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:24.370
Himura!

02:03:24.370 --> 02:03:25.770
You again?

02:03:25.770 --> 02:03:28.040
Something's wrong here.

02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:29.540
Yes.

02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:32.380
Where's Shishio and his Ten Swords?

02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:35.210
Why are you two looking so down?

02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:37.920
It's all been too easy.

02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:44.930
If he meant to burn Kyoto,
he'd be here to see it himself.

02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:11.620
Miss Kaoru Kamiya?

02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:14.120
Who are you?

02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.290
You mean Shishio's got
something else up his sleeve?

02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:28.100
At the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,
when the Shogun and the Emperor

02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:31.600
battled for rule over the land,

02:04:31.610 --> 02:04:37.480
Shogun Yoshinobu abandoned
his forces and fled by ship to Edo.

02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:47.660
Without that, the new government
never would have won.

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.120
History changed course.

02:04:50.130 --> 02:04:55.960
If he can rewrite history,
he'll terrify the government.

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.930
By spitting in their eye?

02:04:57.930 --> 02:05:00.670
Burning Kyoto is a first step.

02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:03.840
If he wants to retrace history...

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:07.010
Just maybe...

02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:11.850
I'm going to bombard Tokyo

02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:20.020
and destroy the country!

02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:25.530
His real aim is Tokyo!

02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:27.460
Kenshin!

02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.370
Miss Kaoru!

02:06:13.610 --> 02:06:15.080
Where are you?

02:06:20.050 --> 02:06:21.420
Where are you?

02:06:23.890 --> 02:06:26.090
Where are you, Battosai?

02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:30.090
Where?

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.930
Where?

02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:37.600
Battosai!

02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:29.290
Who are you?

02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:41.670
Stop!

02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:52.680
Well done!

02:07:53.650 --> 02:07:56.510
You saw that Kyoto was just a feint.

02:07:57.150 --> 02:07:58.880
Where's Miss Kaoru?

02:07:58.890 --> 02:08:02.720
What, you mean you're only here
for a woman?

02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:05.190
Leave her out of this!

02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:07.190
Whatever.

02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:10.360
Miss Kaoru, you're on!

02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:15.670
Miss Kaoru!

02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:19.740
Come on, Yumi! Untie the poor girl.

02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:20.870
Sure.

02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:23.840
Have no fear! I will...

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.210
Stop talking like a damn samurai!

02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:36.020
I want to see that killing spirit of yours.

02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.730
It's me you want. Let her go.

02:08:40.530 --> 02:08:42.560
This is the perfect chance

02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:48.070
to see once and for all who's the best.

02:08:53.370 --> 02:08:54.710
Kenshin!

02:08:54.710 --> 02:08:55.740
Hoji!

02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:58.280
I'll burn her!

02:08:58.280 --> 02:08:59.380
No!

02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:03.620
It hurts when you burn.
So much you want to die.

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:04.880
No.

02:09:04.890 --> 02:09:06.890
Yes!

02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:09.590
It's that rage I want to see!

02:09:10.890 --> 02:09:14.390
You want to kill me, right?

02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:15.460
Try it.

02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:16.560
Shut up.

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:19.730
No! Don't let him tempt you!

02:09:19.730 --> 02:09:23.740
Curse yourself, curse the gods.

02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:27.580
Curse Buddha, hate the times,
hate everything.

02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:28.640
No!

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.880
Now you're looking good.

02:09:37.090 --> 02:09:39.950
Shishio!

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:45.960
Kenshin!

02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:52.970
Miss Kaoru!

02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:55.670
Stay alive!

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.950
Watch, Battosai!

02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:21.300
Is that all you got?

02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:24.000
Can't the legendary Battosai
do better than that?

02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:37.850
What?

02:10:39.650 --> 02:10:43.180
The legend just wants
to play love-suicides?

02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:47.860
Miss Kaoru!

02:10:48.490 --> 02:10:50.020
Miss Kaoru!

02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:53.200
Miss Kaoru!
