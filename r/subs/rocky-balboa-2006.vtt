01:47.816 --> 01:51.360
Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,
almost perfunctory.

01:51.487 --> 01:53.488
The fans let him know how they feel.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.741
Hide the women and children.
This could get ugly.

01:56.825 --> 02:01.329
This crowd does nothing to hide
its anger over this latest debacle.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.207
The fans are mad.
They don't want to take it any more.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.793
They seem to be blaming Dixon,
a good fighter,

02:06.877 --> 02:11.714
for the decline not only of the heavyweight
division guys, but of the entire sport.

02:11.757 --> 02:17.220
They're actually pelting the undefeated
heavyweight champion with ice.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.556
Maybe this angry reaction
will pressure Dixon

02:20.641 --> 02:24.227
to fight someone who can fight back -
if there's somebody out there.

02:24.353 --> 02:30.358
All of boxing is hoping for a warrior
who thrills us with his passion.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.757
Time goes by too fast.

04:59.841 --> 05:04.470
Yeah? Not fast enough.
Your kid should've been here.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.722
- That's all right.
- No, it ain't.

05:06.765 --> 05:10.935
- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
- He don't get that busy.

05:11.061 --> 05:15.481
Well, let's not talk about it here, OK?
You're coming tonight, right?

05:15.565 --> 05:19.276
I'm working.
I took the tour the last three years.

05:19.403 --> 05:23.406
- I know, but it's the anniversary.
- Fine. You got my word.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.741
I appreciate it. Thank you.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.035
I owe you, Paulie.

05:59.359 --> 06:04.363
Robert, what's going on?
Where've you been? You're late.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.282
I don't want to hear it.

06:06.324 --> 06:10.327
Your job performance is nowhere near
good enough to be pulling this.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.622
I don't give a damn who your father is.
You understand me?

06:13.749 --> 06:16.083
All right. Now get outta here.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.127
Thank you, sir.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.131
Yo, Robert.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.467
Yo.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.636
- Hey, how you doin'?
- What's up, champ?

06:27.763 --> 06:31.640
- You caught me off guard.
- I wanted to catch you before you got busy.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.518
- Yeah, it gets busy up there.
- So how you doin'?

06:34.644 --> 06:36.187
- Real good.
- Yeah?

06:36.313 --> 06:39.648
- Yo, Rock!
- Yeah, how you doin'?

06:39.775 --> 06:44.153
- Yeah, real good.
- You wanna go out and get some coffee?

06:44.279 --> 06:48.199
- I'm kinda behind. Maybe later?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

06:48.325 --> 06:52.203
Come by the restaurant tonight.
I can have something made special for you.

06:52.329 --> 06:56.791
Tonight I can't. I got plans.
A few of the guys get together, you know?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.502
- Did I do something wrong?
- What do you mean?

06:59.586 --> 07:02.671
Well... I don't know exactly what I mean,

07:02.756 --> 07:06.842
but I just think that when I come here
you don't feel so comfortable

07:06.927 --> 07:10.262
and I certainly don't wanna do that.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.599
- You... you throw a big shadow.
- A big shadow?

07:13.683 --> 07:16.352
You won't get anything done
down here, Robert.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.855
If you won't introduce me, then I will.
I'm William Tomilson.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.566
- How you doin'?
- Your son works for me.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.527
It's a good job.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.655
I've told Robert about 20 times
that I wanted to meet you.

07:27.697 --> 07:32.701
I guess you're pretty busy, which isn't a bad
thing, is it? Grab a shot, will you, please?

07:32.828 --> 07:36.247
I may not get this chance again.
Old warhorses gotta stick together.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.541
- The old horses, yeah.
- I tell you.

07:38.667 --> 07:42.545
- It's a good thing it's not your left.
- This makes you very popular.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.881
- One, two, three.
- Finally we get to meet.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.551
I gotta go.
It was nice to meet you face to face.

07:48.593 --> 07:53.389
- How you doin'?
- You take care of yourself. I'll see you later.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.227
I gotta get going.
I'll change my plans for tonight.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.188
That'd be great.
I'm lookin' forward to it.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.232
- OK.
- OK.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.444
And do not let those numbers
drive you crazy.

08:07.571 --> 08:12.074
- Too late.
- Use an eraser and get rid of all of 'em.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.495
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Rock.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.581
How you doin'?

08:33.263 --> 08:35.264
Here you go.

08:39.436 --> 08:43.105
It'll be about ten tenths, OK?
You guys take care, OK? You got it.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.444
I'll try a few of these later on.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.864
- It's good for bakin'.
- How much?

08:51.948 --> 08:53.908
- Paul, what's the cost?
- 58.40, sir.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.535
Right. Take it out of that. I trust you.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.332
- You're generous.
- Not a problem.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.643
How you guys doin'?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.485
How we doin', Isabel?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.154
OK, except for the freebie readin' the Bible.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.364
He's OK.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.033
Just cos you fought him
don't mean you gotta feed him.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.536
- He doesn't even look like a fighter.
- Spider Rico could hit.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.373
- Listen, how's your stomach?
- It's OK.

09:42.499 --> 09:46.877
If you keep rubbing that olive oil on your
stomach, your kid will be born very strong.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.547
- OK, whatever you say.
- No, really.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.511
- Yo, how you doin', Spider?
- God bless you, Rocky.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.845
Thanks.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.812
- How you guys doin'?
- Hi, Rocky.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.942
Jose, can you make something special
for my kid who's comin' tonight?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.528
- No problemo.
- Good.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.655
I appreciate it.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.326
Back and forth, back and forth.
Give and take.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.663
Then I went in there like an animal
and threw him into the corner

10:22.747 --> 10:26.542
and I unloaded everything I had -
hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.

10:26.626 --> 10:31.463
But Creed, he kept busting me back
pretty good and the agony began to pile up.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.967
Then I heard the best sound
I ever heard in my life...

10:35.051 --> 10:36.844
- The bell.
- Right, the bell.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.055
And I ain't ever been so tired
and I'm sittin' in my corner

10:40.140 --> 10:44.852
and I'm trying to figure out how to survive
the last round when Mickey says:

10:44.894 --> 10:48.147
"Come on. Get out there
and fight this guy hard, you bum. "

10:48.231 --> 10:50.566
"You gotta be first. You gotta be first. "

10:50.692 --> 10:54.194
- I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could... "
- "I would. "

10:54.279 --> 10:57.156
"I would. " The end.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.241
- Salud.
- Salud.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.394
Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,
almost perfunctory.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.230
The fans let him know how they feel.

11:30.273 --> 11:36.445
They're actually pelting the undefeated
heavyweight champion with ice.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.619
Hello, Adrian's.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.537
Yeah?

11:45.622 --> 11:47.831
Tell him you can't make it?

11:47.916 --> 11:50.542
Yeah, I'll give him the message.

11:50.627 --> 11:55.547
I just kept hearing, you know, Mickey's
voice in my head over and over again.

11:55.632 --> 12:01.011
I just dug down and before you know it,
it was toe-to-toe and it was... Excuse me.

12:01.096 --> 12:06.517
Your son said he can't make it.
He said he'll take a rain check. OK?

12:18.947 --> 12:23.033
Look at these birds.
Don't these birds look like flying candy?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.035
Hey, birdie, you wanna fly me home?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.080
You need somebody to walk you home?

12:29.707 --> 12:35.337
It's a cold night. We need a few laughs
in our life. What do you think?

12:35.463 --> 12:37.506
Maybe? Maybe?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.967
OK, let's get outta here. OK?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.609
This place ain't changed much from last year.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.736
We done?

12:59.821 --> 13:01.947
Hey, how you doin', Mick?

13:04.909 --> 13:10.330
- That sign's fallin' apart, Paulie.
- The whole world's fallin' apart. Look at us.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.000
Don't talk crazy, Paulie.

13:13.042 --> 13:19.006
You know, I think if you live someplace
long enough, you are that place.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.592
I ain't no talkin' building.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.261
Come on, it's gettin' late.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.139
I get a headache from this train.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.912
I remember when she was standin' there

13:49.996 --> 13:54.208
all nervous and shy with this little smile,

13:54.292 --> 13:57.544
and all I wanted her to do was trust me.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.925
She did.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.345
- She did.
- You done?

14:21.945 --> 14:24.821
- How long we stayin' here?
- Not long.

14:24.948 --> 14:28.700
- I'm glad they tore this rink down.
- Come on.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.246
You heard me.
I'm happy they tore it apart.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.629
The first time I walked your sister
across this ice, we was over there.

14:40.755 --> 14:44.299
She was nervous, but I weren't
so great on the blades either.

14:44.425 --> 14:48.554
Ice is stupid.
People standing on ice are more stupid.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.183
Then over there, when she was fallin'...

14:54.143 --> 14:57.729
my hand grabbed her and I got her arm.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.607
Through that coat I could feel it.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.652
Electric.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.322
You said the same thing last year, Rock.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.992
- Did I?
- You better develop your brain.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.161
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.039
Come on, Rock, let's go.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.837
We're done. There's no place
to sit down around here.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.381
- It's all right.
- It ain't all right.

15:24.507 --> 15:28.010
It's depressing and freakin' cold!

15:28.678 --> 15:32.681
- What's the matter with you, Paulie?
- You're livin' backwards, Rocko.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.184
Change the channel from yesterday.
Yesterday wasn't so great.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.854
- It was to me.
- Not to me!

15:40.690 --> 15:44.693
You treated her good.
You had the good times.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.322
I treated her bad.
I don't have to think about this.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.867
She always loved you, Paulie.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.416
Sorry, Rocko.
I can't do this no more.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.449
- Can I help you?
- Nah, nah.

17:14.575 --> 17:20.122
I used to come down this place a long time
ago. Just lookin' around. No big deal.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.499
Can I get you a drink?

17:23.459 --> 17:26.837
- All right, maybe just a short beer.
- OK.

17:37.473 --> 17:42.310
Go. Yeah, go on. Get him to buy you one.
Get him to buy you one. Go.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.647
He's got it.
He's spending money.

17:45.773 --> 17:49.901
Listen... I don't mean
to cross the line or anything,

17:49.986 --> 17:54.072
but I read about your wife's passin'
a few years back.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.658
- Yeah, it was woman cancer.
- Yeah.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.119
I always heard she was a nice person.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.163
Yeah, the best.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.500
- Do I know you?
- We met a long time ago.

18:05.585 --> 18:09.337
- We did?
- When I was a kid you walked me home.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.758
- I did?
- Told me to stop smokin' and things.

18:14.177 --> 18:17.053
Stop smokin'?

18:17.180 --> 18:20.724
Are you little Marie that used to hang out
at that Atomic Hoagie shop?

18:20.850 --> 18:23.310
Yeah, that's right.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.687
Yeah, now I remember.
I walked you home.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.691
When you got there, you turned around
and said, "Screw you, creepo. "

18:29.734 --> 18:32.194
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.781
- You sure?
- Great insults last a long time.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.365
Yo!

18:37.408 --> 18:40.535
- Yo, is that you? Is that really you?
- How you doin'?

18:40.620 --> 18:44.206
- I think he wants to drink alone.
- Well, then, give him his drink.

18:44.290 --> 18:50.879
I ain't stoppin' you. What's that, your man
or something? No, I don't think so.

18:52.006 --> 18:56.760
Anyway, me and my friends, we're down
there. You think you could buy us a round?

18:56.886 --> 18:58.887
You got the money.
Just one round.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.680
Hey...

19:01.849 --> 19:05.060
What...? What are you doin'
pushin' my hand away like that?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.938
- What's your name?
- Angie. Why do you wanna know?

19:08.064 --> 19:11.566
- Angie, don't be playin' a fool for that guy.
- A fool?

19:11.651 --> 19:15.237
A fool? I'm the fool?
You're the fool, not me.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.573
You got it twisted. You're the fool.
I'm a person just like you.

19:18.699 --> 19:22.244
You ain't no better than me.
You think you're a big shot now?

19:22.370 --> 19:25.580
You ain't no better than me.
No better.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.125
- Wow.
- Glad you dropped in?

19:29.252 --> 19:32.838
I think the neighbourhood's changin' a little.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.715
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. It's OK.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.010
Well, if you wanna take off,
I'll tally everything up.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.929
- Thanks.
- How you doin', Rock?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.598
I'm good, thanks.

19:45.101 --> 19:49.020
- You live around here?
- About eight blocks from here.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.106
Eight blocks.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.317
Would you need a lift?

19:54.443 --> 19:55.443
All right.

19:56.571 --> 19:59.698
- Did you ever get married?
- Yeah, sorta.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.616
- Sorta?
- Well, he took off.

20:01.659 --> 20:05.537
- Poof, just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.623
- You sorta have any kids?
- Yeah, I got one kid.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.251
Yeah, me too. Me too.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.962
- Wonderful boy.
- Hey, tough guy!

20:14.046 --> 20:16.756
What's the matter?
You can't buy a round?

20:16.799 --> 20:19.259
Girl was bein' nice to your dumb ass.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.761
Yeah, what you doin' with that pig?

20:21.846 --> 20:25.056
- She ain't nothin' but a jealous bitch.
- Come on back!

20:25.141 --> 20:26.933
Hey, don't listen to 'em.

20:27.018 --> 20:30.145
Both of yous.
You ain't no better than me!

20:30.271 --> 20:33.607
- Come over here!
- Everybody's her man.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.944
- You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.
- You ain't no big shot! Look at you!

20:37.987 --> 20:41.656
You ain't even got a car
to take that pig home.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.579
You all right?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.664
Yeah.

20:51.125 --> 20:55.170
What are you doing?
Don't get out. It's all right.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.841
No, little Marie, it ain't all right.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.556
- Yo!
- What?

21:06.682 --> 21:10.352
I'll tell you what.
Get inside. You get inside.

21:10.478 --> 21:13.271
Hey! Leave him alone!

21:13.356 --> 21:15.690
- You see that? You see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.068
- What do you say?
- I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.070
Good job.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.880
That guy sends his apologies.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.340
OK.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.733
Martin.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.528
Martin. Yo, Martin!

22:06.283 --> 22:10.912
- I see you still got your key.
- Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?

22:11.038 --> 22:13.790
I got a lot of time since your people let me go.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.251
You know I had nothing to do with that.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.044
Yeah?

22:19.588 --> 22:22.507
- Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.
- Yeah?

22:22.591 --> 22:25.427
- I mean, it's only temporary.
- Yeah, I can see that.

22:25.553 --> 22:29.055
- I'm gonna look for an apartment.
- Apartments are nice.

22:29.098 --> 22:33.018
- Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
- Yeah. It is what it is.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.688
But this place used to be nice.
There's a lot of history around here.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.899
Yeah, like down the street there
is the Cambria Fight Club.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.611
They used to call that the Bucket of Blood.
I took some beatings there.

22:43.696 --> 22:50.577
But it was nice. Good memories. I heard
these buildings are 100, 150 years old.

22:50.661 --> 22:55.790
So, I mean, if I was 150 years old I'd be
falling apart too, so it's OK the buildings...

22:55.875 --> 23:00.628
- Does that light work?
- No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.967
Hey, listen. Thanks for the ride,
and I'm sorry about those guys.

23:06.093 --> 23:10.388
Oh, that's OK. Some of those guys just
got their brains on backwards and stuff.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.349
- What's he doin' out so late?
- Is that your kid?

23:13.476 --> 23:16.144
Yeah. I wish he wouldn't stay out so late.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.813
- Amazing.
- Yeah? What's that?

23:18.898 --> 23:24.110
Oh, last time I seen you, you was a kid,
and now you officially got one of your own.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.946
It's amazing.
You know, he sorta resembles you.

23:26.989 --> 23:30.492
He's got that, you know, big Irish hair.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.827
Yeah, it's the other one.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.624
- Yeah?
- His father was from Jamaica.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.126
Jamaica? European.

23:42.171 --> 23:45.799
- Was you on a cruise ship or somethin'?
- No, not really.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.511
- What's his name?
- Steps. Short for Stevenson.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.388
Right. Makes sense.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.394
Is he lookin' like he's mad at me,
or is it the angle I'm standin' at?

23:58.479 --> 24:01.940
No, no, no. He's a good kid.
You want to meet him?

24:02.066 --> 24:06.152
You know, it's gettin' kinda late.
I got so many things to do. It's...

24:06.195 --> 24:12.325
Yeah, I understand. Thanks again
for the ride and everything else.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.704
I'll see you.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.373
You too.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.377
Hey, Steps, come on, let's go.
Say good night to your friend.

24:22.503 --> 24:26.047
What are you doin' out with no hat on?
Did you get something to eat?

24:26.132 --> 24:29.551
- Did you eat your dinner?
- Yeah, I already ate.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.554
You're late, you know?
I've told you...

24:32.680 --> 24:34.764
Yo, little Marie.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.644
Ain't you going to introduce me to your kid?
How you doin', Steps?

24:39.728 --> 24:42.772
- What's up?
- Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,

24:42.898 --> 24:45.525
nice little eatery not too far from here.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.777
What's all this junk? A tissue...

24:47.862 --> 24:51.573
Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo
with all the stuff in my pocket.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.825
Here you go.
I got a card, there it is.

24:53.909 --> 24:59.038
And if you ever get a chance, it'd be great
if both of yous come down there and eat.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.207
It'd be great.
Free. You know?

25:01.250 --> 25:04.836
Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.

25:06.255 --> 25:09.465
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.847
See you later.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.309
Come on, let's go.

25:21.729 --> 25:26.983
You've known what's best for you
since you were ten and walked in here alone.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.611
Got everything money can buy...

25:29.653 --> 25:32.280
except what it can't.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.407
It's pride.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.911
Pride is what got your ass outta here.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.206
Losin' it is what brung you back.

25:41.290 --> 25:46.211
But people like you, they need to be tested.
Need a challenge.

25:46.295 --> 25:49.130
That ain't gonna happen.
Ain't nothin' out there.

25:49.256 --> 25:52.342
There's always somebody out there.
Always.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.304
And when you find somethin'
standin' in front of you,

25:56.388 --> 25:59.015
somethin' that ain't runnin', ain't backin' up,

25:59.099 --> 26:03.645
and it's hittin' on you
and you're too damn tired to breathe...

26:03.771 --> 26:06.773
You find that situation on you, that's good,

26:06.815 --> 26:09.359
cos that's baptism under fire.

26:11.320 --> 26:16.115
You get through that, you find
the only kind of respect that matters -

26:16.158 --> 26:18.159
self-respect.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.790
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate it.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.834
Now, what can the champ do for you?

26:26.961 --> 26:31.005
You can give me some of that money you got.

26:31.090 --> 26:35.093
- You know I like you, Martin.
- But not that much.

26:40.391 --> 26:44.143
- How about a picture with the kid, Rock?
- Sure.

26:46.272 --> 26:51.359
Here, son, hold up your fist.
Makes you look more hazardous.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.735
- There you go.
- Thanks.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.405
Enjoy your meal.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.323
- He's a nice guy.
- Rocky?

26:57.366 --> 27:01.160
- Yeah?
- Listen. Spider just went downstairs.

27:01.245 --> 27:06.541
- What's he doin' down there?
- I don't know. That's your friend.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.213
Yo, Spider.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.925
- Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
- Oh, come on. You're my guest.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.594
- Let me do something.
- Keep eating. Guests do.

27:18.721 --> 27:21.639
Don't make me fight you again.
Last time you got lucky.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.725
Lucky? OK.

27:23.851 --> 27:26.227
Jesus wants me to work.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.646
- Yo, Rocky.
- Yeah?

27:28.731 --> 27:31.399
You got guests.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.445
Don't get too wet, OK?

27:35.571 --> 27:37.530
Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.

27:43.912 --> 27:47.540
- You kept the card.
- Yeah, I kept the card.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.917
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

27:59.595 --> 28:04.724
Because you know what? I walk in there,
I say good morning, I do this, I do this.

28:04.808 --> 28:09.062
Tonight, boxing once again.
Two contrasting styles in almost every way.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.482
- Hey, can you turn this up?
- Welcome to ESPN's Then Versus Now.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.776
Who was the best of all time?

28:14.818 --> 28:19.530
If two athletes from different eras could
compete, who would come out on top?

28:19.615 --> 28:23.409
Given the same rules, using the same
equipment, who was the greatest?

28:23.452 --> 28:25.411
We feed our facts into the computer.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.997
They will weigh in on
who they think is supreme,

28:28.123 --> 28:31.334
while fielding the comments
of our panel of sports writers.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.093
Champ!

28:40.135 --> 28:41.803
- Yo, champ!
- Yeah?

28:41.929 --> 28:44.806
Man, come check out this trash
they talkin' about you.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.934
- What you talkin' about?
- Come check this out. Hurry up.

28:47.976 --> 28:52.939
Tonight, the former two-time heavyweight
champion from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.941
Chuck Johnson, USA Today.

28:54.983 --> 28:59.612
Rocky Balboa fought much tougher fights
during a much tougher era in boxing.

28:59.655 --> 29:04.117
You look at Mason Dixon and his career,
he's been spoon-fed his opponents.

29:04.201 --> 29:09.664
No question in my mind, not only
does Rocky win, but he wins knockout.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.166
Rocky!

29:13.127 --> 29:14.085
Offspring!

29:15.295 --> 29:18.339
- What do you think?
- Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.

29:18.382 --> 29:21.509
He's never been in real knock-down,
drag-out brawls.

29:21.593 --> 29:26.139
He's never had to dig down to rally back.
If he tries to dig down against Balboa,

29:26.181 --> 29:31.394
he's gonna find that he doesn't have a big
enough shovel. I clearly give it to Balboa.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.857
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

29:35.899 --> 29:37.400
Burt Randolph Sugar.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.862
Dixon has fought cream puffs,
so we don't know what he's made of.

29:40.904 --> 29:46.325
Both in their primes - and you gotta factor
in Dixon's speed, his slashing offence -

29:46.368 --> 29:49.203
he cuts Balboa to bits, no doubt.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.206
Dixon wins all the way.

29:52.332 --> 29:56.794
Here's where our subjectivity ends.
Let's see what the computer has to say.

29:56.879 --> 30:00.047
Dixon unloads on Balboa.
Rocky has no answer.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.550
Balboa's eating dirt.

30:17.900 --> 30:22.403
Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.
He is almost out on his feet.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.573
Balboa turning up the heat,
hounds him across the ring.

30:25.699 --> 30:29.076
He's bitten off more than he can chew
this time, believe it.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.120
Oh, a murderous right hook!

30:31.205 --> 30:33.247
And Dixon is out on his feet!

30:33.332 --> 30:36.209
He is out cold
as he crumbles to the canvas.

30:36.293 --> 30:39.253
And it is Balboa who has won the event!

30:41.507 --> 30:45.468
Ladies and gentlemen,
Baby Rocky. Baby Rocky.

30:50.933 --> 30:56.521
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat that up
it's pretty good in the morning.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.649
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- Nice kid.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.318
I hope this music ain't givin' you a headache.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.779
No, I like it. It's nice.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.240
Well, good. Good.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.377
Yo. You think Steps wants a job?

31:19.461 --> 31:22.588
Make a few bucks in a weekend.
It's good makin' your own G.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.132
My kid stashed a few bucks doin' that.

31:25.259 --> 31:28.052
Why are you being so nice?

31:28.136 --> 31:33.641
I don't want you to think nothing's off,
you know? My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.

31:33.725 --> 31:38.729
- Yeah, I wasn't thinkin' that, believe me.
- No? Then what was you thinkin'?

31:38.814 --> 31:41.440
That you don't owe us nothin'.
What are you doin'?

31:41.525 --> 31:43.442
Be patient.

31:43.527 --> 31:47.446
No, I don't owe you nothin',

31:47.489 --> 31:52.076
but why you gotta owe something to get...

31:52.160 --> 31:53.995
Yo! Yikes.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.414
Bingo.

32:00.836 --> 32:04.005
But why you gotta owe something
to get something, you know?

32:04.131 --> 32:06.173
Really.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.846
I think hangin' out with your kid
would be nice. What do you think?

32:11.930 --> 32:14.140
I think that'd be nice.

32:15.183 --> 32:16.976
Good.

32:17.019 --> 32:20.479
That's very nice.
I'm glad you come by.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.233
Nice... nice watchin' you eat.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.571
Good company.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.035
Yo, little Marie.
Let there be light.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.173
- You like dogs?
- Dogs?

32:47.257 --> 32:50.009
Dogs. This is, like, a dog pound.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.345
It's where they keep...

32:52.429 --> 32:54.680
a large variety of dogs.

32:54.723 --> 33:00.853
I used to come here for sightseein',
but, you know, you learn a lot talkin' to dogs.

33:00.896 --> 33:04.482
- Really, you do.
- Yeah, man.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.193
Hey, man, how about this one?

33:08.612 --> 33:13.407
- He don't look too friendly, my friend.
- This is the one. Hey, boy, how you doin'?

33:13.450 --> 33:17.411
- What about this one? Come here, boy.
- Who, him?

33:17.496 --> 33:20.706
- Yeah, why not?
- Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.875
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.

33:22.918 --> 33:26.754
If you look at it closely,
the colour kinda looks like old furniture,

33:26.838 --> 33:29.423
like some kinda pirate chest thing goin' on.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.926
Yeah, sure, man.
Hey, how about a young one?

33:31.968 --> 33:35.596
Forget him. Come over here a minute.
I want you to see something.

33:35.639 --> 33:40.017
Now, you notice what this animal
is doin' here, lyin' in that position?

33:40.102 --> 33:44.438
- He ain't doin' nothin'.
- He's doin' a lot. He ain't wastin' no energy.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.941
Cos he's dead.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.990
There's a lot of good mileage
left in that animal.

33:55.075 --> 33:59.161
Some good food, the addition of a couple
of new friends - bingo, he's back.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.665
- But what do you think's a good name?
- It's your dog. You name him.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.459
Hey, no. It's a community animal.
50-50.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.295
Look, I don't know much about no dogs.

34:08.338 --> 34:12.466
Well, you know, Steps, it ain't that
complicated. You pet 'em, you feed 'em,

34:12.509 --> 34:16.971
and nature takes its course, you know.
Don't you wanna name an animal?

34:17.054 --> 34:21.434
I think every guy should one time
try to name an animal something.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.476
I don't know. Fleabag.

34:23.520 --> 34:27.815
It's catchy. You know,
it ain't original but it's pretty good.

34:27.940 --> 34:33.487
I think you could come up with in your
young brain something better than Fleabag.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.157
Punchy. How's that?

34:37.617 --> 34:40.119
- Punchy?
- Yeah, Punchy.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.833
- I like it, you know?
- For real?

34:45.876 --> 34:49.085
For real. Punchy it is.
I think Punchy's easy to remember,

34:49.170 --> 34:53.424
it's not that hard to spell, and then once
it's in your brain you never forget it.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.760
- Punchy. Very good.
- All right, man.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.679
Good call. All right, Punchy.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.931
You ready to be bailed out, my friend?

35:01.016 --> 35:04.101
OK. Hey.

35:04.186 --> 35:10.191
- You know I was just joking with you, right?
- Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.559
Rocky?

35:48.605 --> 35:50.648
Excuse me.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.238
- Rock.
- Yo, Paulie.

35:57.364 --> 36:00.866
Hey, they're gonna be talking
about that fake Looney Tune fight.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.786
Hey, come on.
We're about to serve today's special.

36:03.912 --> 36:07.414
Italian food cooked by a bunch of Mexicans
ain't so special, Rocko.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.917
Hey, yo.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.504
Hey, I skipped work for this.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.592
What an ugly dog.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.264
It's a cute dog.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.475
Hey, Rock.
I'm gonna take off, all right?

36:26.560 --> 36:29.019
- That stuff back there is cool.
- You like that?

36:29.104 --> 36:31.230
- Yeah, man.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

36:31.273 --> 36:34.692
- I'm gonna catch you later.
- All right.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.240
- Who's the criminal?
- He's a nice kid.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.117
He dresses like a bum.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.454
Coming from a human hamper,
that's quite a compliment.

36:47.497 --> 36:50.624
- Hide the silverware.
- That's nice.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.920
Hey, Spider.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.926
Didn't you knock out that bum once?

37:00.969 --> 37:03.304
Will you give it a rest?

37:13.356 --> 37:16.817
I'm gonna be late for work for this.
Give me a break, huh?

37:16.860 --> 37:19.862
All right, just for a few seconds.

37:19.988 --> 37:23.532
In the late '60s a simulated fight
took place between two legends,

37:23.658 --> 37:25.868
Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.703
Marciano, long retired,

37:27.829 --> 37:30.748
and Ali, unable to fight legitimately
for three years

37:30.832 --> 37:33.334
for refusing induction
into the armed forces,

37:33.418 --> 37:36.337
was in need of money
and agreed to the dream match

37:36.421 --> 37:39.131
whose outcome would be decided
by a computer.

37:39.174 --> 37:43.928
It's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano
won the much-disputed computer decision

37:44.012 --> 37:46.847
and guess what -
not much has changed.

37:46.973 --> 37:52.311
- Last week, Rocky Balboa won...
- That's the cartoon fight I told you about.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.021
Yeah.

37:54.064 --> 37:58.359
A stunning knockout. And keep in mind
this is taking the human factor out of it.

37:58.485 --> 38:01.862
- Whoa, that was beautiful.
- Rocky Balboa would be triumphant.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.449
KO 13, and here's some of the fallout.

38:05.533 --> 38:09.536
What started as a form of entertainment
has now become this rallying cry

38:09.621 --> 38:13.248
for people who think an old-school athlete
like Balboa could be better,

38:13.375 --> 38:17.044
so computer technology has to create
what isn't. That's irresponsible.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.129
Get therapy, will you?

38:19.214 --> 38:21.882
Skip, how do you think Balboa
would do against Dixon?

38:22.008 --> 38:25.386
Badly. Personally, I think Balboa
was completely overrated.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.471
You know he owns a restaurant.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.057
What's the specialty?
Pounded chicken?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.977
I would have paid to see the fight.
Next topic, NASCAR,

38:33.061 --> 38:37.773
and the controversy that won't go away.
Let's go back to Sunday's race.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.776
Hey, hey, hey. Cheer up.
Free advertisement.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.237
Come on. Meat house calls.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.249
Yo, Robert.

38:57.585 --> 39:01.797
- What are you doing out so late?
- I tried callin' but nothing was pickin' up.

39:01.923 --> 39:05.509
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, I just wanted to see you in person.

39:05.593 --> 39:09.972
- You wanna come inside?
- I wanna get your opinion on something.

39:10.056 --> 39:14.018
- Sure. Opinion on what?
- They say you only go around once, right?

39:14.102 --> 39:16.478
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- Well...

39:16.604 --> 39:19.189
I think I wanna, like, do something.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.275
- Like what?
- Fight.

39:23.069 --> 39:26.613
You know, nothing big.
Small stuff, like locally.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.952
Don't you think you're too, you know, old?

39:31.995 --> 39:35.664
You think you oughta stop tryin'
cos you had too many birthdays?

39:35.790 --> 39:38.000
- I do not.
- People'll think you're crazy.

39:38.126 --> 39:42.129
What's crazy about standin' toe-to-toe
saying, "I am," you know?

39:42.213 --> 39:45.299
That's just the ego talkin'.

39:45.341 --> 39:48.969
Look, what are you tryin' to prove
to other people, Pop?

39:49.012 --> 39:54.016
Prove? Listen, I... I stopped thinkin'
the way other people think a long time ago.

39:54.142 --> 39:57.478
You know, you gotta think like you think.

39:57.604 --> 40:00.147
- I do.
- Do you? Good.

40:00.273 --> 40:03.484
You gotta... you gotta face reality.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.820
OK? It's... it's a different world now.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.490
Only the clothes is different.

40:11.284 --> 40:14.328
I really don't know what you want from me.

40:14.829 --> 40:19.666
I just want us to get involved,
you know, like a home team.

40:21.628 --> 40:27.132
Look, whatever it is,
whatever you're going through, it'll pass.

40:27.175 --> 40:32.012
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- Time, it's gonna catch up to all of us.

40:32.097 --> 40:36.600
- Especially if you're standin' still.
- Hey, come on.

40:38.478 --> 40:41.855
Look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.110
- Did you tell your kid?
- I did.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.403
- He think you're nuts?
- Yeah.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.490
Well, he don't believe in you?

40:51.533 --> 40:54.409
Welcome to my world, buddy.

40:54.494 --> 40:57.746
Rocko, nobody's givin' you no title shot.

40:57.831 --> 41:00.290
I know that.
I don't want one.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.918
So this isn't a mental disturbance?

41:04.045 --> 41:05.420
No.

41:05.547 --> 41:09.049
You're mad because
they took down your statue?

41:09.175 --> 41:10.217
No.

41:11.803 --> 41:15.556
- Not really, no.
- If it's about money,

41:15.682 --> 41:22.020
just hang a sign around your neck saying,
"Punch me, $5." You'll make big money.

41:23.690 --> 41:26.150
What? You haven't peaked yet?

41:26.901 --> 41:29.403
- Peaked?
- Yeah, peaked.

41:29.904 --> 41:33.240
I don't know. There's still
some stuff in the basement.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.576
- What basement?
- In here.

41:36.744 --> 41:40.706
- Tell me about the stuff.
- What about it?

41:40.748 --> 41:46.170
- Tell me about the stuff inside. Is it angry?
- Angry?

41:46.254 --> 41:50.924
- Are you mad because Adrian left you?
- She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.926
OK. OK, OK, OK.

41:57.515 --> 42:01.185
You know, some...
sometimes it's hard to breathe.

42:01.269 --> 42:05.272
You know, I feel, like, this beast inside me.

42:05.315 --> 42:08.066
It's OK, Rocko.
Please, it's OK.

42:08.109 --> 42:11.653
Is it... OK?

42:17.035 --> 42:20.746
I... I just never knew
it was supposed to be this hard.

42:20.788 --> 42:25.209
It wasn't supposed to be like this,
Paulie, you know?

42:33.635 --> 42:37.471
- You wanna come by and help me train?
- I got a job here.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.640
I understand.

42:39.766 --> 42:44.895
Remember you said if you stay one place
long enough you become that place?

42:44.979 --> 42:47.231
Rocko, this is all I got.

42:47.315 --> 42:50.567
I understand, Paulie. I do.

42:54.739 --> 42:59.493
Well, if you get time and maybe come down
and see me train, I'd appreciate it.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.662
Of course, Rocko.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.708
Bye, Paulie.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.794
Goodbye, Rocko.

43:11.506 --> 43:13.507
Take care, Rocko.

43:18.888 --> 43:23.850
This plenary session of the Pennsylvania
Athletic Commission is convened

43:23.977 --> 43:28.355
in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa

43:28.398 --> 43:32.818
for the issuance of a discretionary
professional boxing licence

43:32.860 --> 43:37.656
due to his ineligibility
to be licensed as a matter of right.

43:37.699 --> 43:41.743
Mr Balboa, you are welcome here.
Since you're representing yourself,

43:41.828 --> 43:45.038
we invite you to make
an opening statement if you'd like to.

43:45.123 --> 43:47.833
No, I'm just curious how I did, that's all.

43:47.875 --> 43:52.546
All right. Well, the medical advisory board
has informed us

43:52.672 --> 43:55.590
that the tests to which
you have been subjected,

43:55.675 --> 43:59.136
you've passed these tests with flying colours.

43:59.220 --> 44:02.556
- And we congratulate you for that.
- Thanks.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.601
However, this commission
in good conscience

44:06.728 --> 44:08.895
cannot recommend you for a licence,

44:08.938 --> 44:12.316
and we therefore deny your application.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.570
- Didn't I do what you asked?
- Yes, you did.

44:16.696 --> 44:20.032
- So I should get a licence, right?
- Not exactly.

44:22.952 --> 44:26.538
So why'd you give me all them tests
if you was never passin' me?

44:26.581 --> 44:29.082
We've got to stand by our decision here,

44:29.208 --> 44:34.046
and we have to deny your request
for a licence at this time.

44:44.474 --> 44:49.394
- Yo, don't I got some rights?
- What rights are you referring to?

44:49.479 --> 44:53.231
- Like in that official paper they wrote.
- That's the Bill of Rights.

44:53.274 --> 44:56.651
Don't it say something
about goin' after what makes you happy?

44:56.736 --> 44:59.780
No, that's the pursuit of happiness.
What's your point?

44:59.906 --> 45:03.116
I'm pursuing something
and nobody looks happy about it.

45:03.159 --> 45:05.786
But we're just looking out for your interests.

45:05.828 --> 45:09.706
But maybe you're lookin' out
for your interests just a little bit more.

45:09.791 --> 45:13.460
You shouldn't ask people to come
and pay the freight on somethin',

45:13.503 --> 45:16.505
they pay, they're still not good enough.
Is that right?

45:16.631 --> 45:20.467
Maybe you're doin' your job,
but why you gotta stop me from doin' mine?

45:20.510 --> 45:24.346
If you're willin' to go through the battling
to get to where you wanna get,

45:24.472 --> 45:26.264
who's got the right to stop you?

45:26.307 --> 45:30.060
Maybe you guys got something
you never finished, you really wanna do,

45:30.144 --> 45:34.481
you never said to somebody - something!
You're told no after you pay your dues.

45:34.524 --> 45:38.944
Who's got the right to tell you that? Nobody!
It's your right to listen to your gut.

45:38.986 --> 45:45.158
It ain't nobody's right to say no after you
earned the right to do what you wanna do!

45:48.371 --> 45:52.624
You know, the older I get, the more things
I gotta leave behind. That's life.

45:52.667 --> 45:58.505
The only thing I'm asking you guys
to leave on the table is what's right.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.690
Yo! Have you seen the paper today?

46:16.732 --> 46:19.192
Front row. Front row.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.194
That is so great.

46:21.237 --> 46:24.364
- All right, all right.
- You know what? Let's go get some food.

46:24.407 --> 46:27.701
- Come on, come on. Hey!
- Robert, come on.

46:28.494 --> 46:33.331
The last pay-per-views were in the toilet.
You're not makin' championship money.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.500
There's a bunch of nobodies out there.

46:35.543 --> 46:38.503
I wanna talk to you
about an interesting opportunity.

46:38.546 --> 46:42.507
Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa
applied for a licence and got one, yeah?

46:42.550 --> 46:44.551
- Yeah. Forget about it.
- Hear me out.

46:44.677 --> 46:48.054
You want me to fight a guy I can beat
with both hands behind my back?

46:48.181 --> 46:51.725
Everybody knows you can beat the guy,
but that's not what it's about.

46:51.767 --> 46:55.187
It's about money. We gotta capitalise
on that computer fight.

46:55.229 --> 46:57.939
This could do a million buys.
15, 20 million to you.

46:58.065 --> 47:01.193
- Forget about it.
- Then what do you wanna do?

47:01.235 --> 47:04.237
- Look, man, we got guaranteed fights.
- We don't.

47:04.280 --> 47:07.574
You wanna do this now, I'll do it now.
We got nothing, Mace.

47:07.617 --> 47:11.203
All the fights you come up with
all got rejected. You know why?

47:11.245 --> 47:15.415
They're all bums out there. Nobody cares
about them. There's no marquee value.

47:15.458 --> 47:19.461
But this Balboa thing is interesting
because... Listen to me.

47:19.587 --> 47:23.590
It's a has-been-never-gonna-be world.
Call it nostalgia if you want,

47:23.633 --> 47:25.592
but people can relate to that stuff.

47:25.676 --> 47:28.261
- This is a no-lose. It's all good.
- Good for who?

47:28.304 --> 47:31.473
For you! Not for me, for you!
Maybe you don't understand.

47:31.599 --> 47:35.268
People don't like you no more.
They're not supporting you any more.

47:35.353 --> 47:37.270
Don't you understand that?

47:37.355 --> 47:41.608
Don't look at me like I'm messin' with your
legacy. Every jock thinks they got a legacy.

47:41.651 --> 47:44.152
A legacy is what you get
instead of getting paid.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.947
- Hey, don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
- I'm not.

47:46.989 --> 47:50.617
Everybody knows you could kick
this old man's ass, but you don't.

47:50.743 --> 47:54.746
You leave him with a bit of dignity.
So they say, "Mason's got compassion. "

47:54.789 --> 47:59.167
"He's a decent guy. " You got a whole new
audience who'll double your money.

47:59.293 --> 48:03.505
- Want a new image? That's how you get it.
- To replace the one that you two made?

48:03.631 --> 48:06.299
Wait. We made your world green.
You made the rest.

48:06.384 --> 48:10.262
- You made all this junk happen.
- I've had it up to here with this mess, man.

48:10.304 --> 48:14.724
- I'm goin' back to Martin's gym.
- All right, we'll talk about this crap.

48:14.809 --> 48:17.352
I want Martin back.
There's nothing to talk about.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.990
- How you doin'?
- What a surprise.

48:30.074 --> 48:34.661
I was drivin' around the neighbourhood.
I thought, "Why not drive by and say hello?"

48:34.704 --> 48:37.497
- Do you wanna come inside?
- The dog needs exercise.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.541
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Yeah.

48:39.667 --> 48:42.168
- It's nice outside.
- All right.

48:42.295 --> 48:44.838
- Nice and brisk.
- When did you get a dog?

48:44.964 --> 48:47.465
We picked up Punchy a couple of days back.

48:47.508 --> 48:50.302
Punchy. You named a dog Punchy?

48:50.344 --> 48:54.639
- Actually, your kid come up with the name.
- Yeah? I think that's disrespectful.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.933
No, no, it's fine, really, no.

48:57.018 --> 49:00.103
It's easy to remember,
and it's all that, you know.

49:00.187 --> 49:03.356
What do you think about
comin' over to the restaurant?

49:03.441 --> 49:07.235
- What for?
- Well, you know, for, like... for work.

49:07.320 --> 49:10.030
The hostess is gonna be having a kid.
You'd do good.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.824
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you, you'd do good.

49:12.908 --> 49:16.202
I appreciate what you're doin' for my kid,
but I can't.

49:16.287 --> 49:20.749
Hey, listen. I think you'd like it a lot.
It's a nice environment. It's very pleasant.

49:20.875 --> 49:23.043
Can we drop it?

49:25.212 --> 49:26.880
What's botherin' you?

49:26.964 --> 49:31.635
- Nothin'. It's all right. I gotta get back.
- No, it ain't all right.

49:31.719 --> 49:33.553
- Oh, come on.
- What?

49:33.596 --> 49:35.889
I'm the first person people see?

49:35.973 --> 49:39.643
Yeah. You just give out menus,
say hello, sit people down.

49:39.727 --> 49:42.729
Look, little Marie, if I can do it,
anybody can do it.

49:42.813 --> 49:46.232
You could find ten better people,
100 better people for this job.

49:46.359 --> 49:50.236
- Give it a try. Like, two weeks.
- I don't wanna try.

49:50.321 --> 49:52.572
- Who put this stuff in your head?
- Nobody.

49:52.698 --> 49:56.201
Well, it just don't get in there by itself.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.372
Thanks for comin' by.

50:02.083 --> 50:06.711
Yo. When was the last time you went dancin'?
Has it been a while?

50:06.754 --> 50:10.090
- Why are you askin'?
- Cos you're dancin' around these problems,

50:10.132 --> 50:15.387
you might as well dance with me. I ain't that
good, but I'm better than the average bear.

50:15.429 --> 50:19.474
- And where that came from, I don't know.
- You're crazy.

50:19.600 --> 50:24.437
A little bit. But the way you're thinkin',
the way you're talkin', it's a little crazy too.

50:24.563 --> 50:28.233
Come on. You deserve better.
Really. Come on over.

50:28.275 --> 50:32.779
I need you to class my place up.
Philly needs you.

50:32.905 --> 50:36.533
And if you say, "Screw you, creepo," again
I totally understand,

50:36.617 --> 50:41.204
but I warn you, I'm gonna put myself, like,
geographically in the middle of the street

50:41.288 --> 50:44.416
and stand here, me and Punchy,
wave to the first bus and say:

50:44.458 --> 50:48.962
"Come over here and mash me, cos Marie
turned down the job at the restaurant. "

50:49.088 --> 50:51.548
- "She thinks she's better than us. "
- Oh, yeah?

50:51.632 --> 50:54.676
Well, there hasn't been
a bus down here in 20 years.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.803
- Yeah?
- No.

50:58.681 --> 51:00.515
That was a close call.

51:01.559 --> 51:04.144
Listen, seriously.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.980
Come on over. It'll be nice.

51:09.275 --> 51:11.276
All right.

51:28.961 --> 51:30.837
Paulie!

51:33.758 --> 51:35.842
Sorry, Paulie.

51:37.011 --> 51:39.012
Sorry.

52:10.002 --> 52:13.087
How are you?
Get my unusual up there.

52:13.214 --> 52:16.174
Excuse me.
Deliveries are in the back.

52:16.217 --> 52:20.011
- I'm not a delivery guy.
- Well, do you have a reservation?

52:20.054 --> 52:22.931
Do I look like a freakin' Indian?

52:25.893 --> 52:27.894
Hey, Rock. Rocky?

52:32.775 --> 52:35.735
I think we got a little bit of a problem
with this guy.

52:35.861 --> 52:38.905
A problem?
No, no, he's just a relative.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.657
OK.

52:43.577 --> 52:44.702
Yo, Paulie.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.873
- What happened to your eye?
- I hit it.

52:48.958 --> 52:51.084
- Why?
- Needed to.

52:51.752 --> 52:54.629
- What happened?
- I'm celebratin', Rock.

52:54.713 --> 52:57.048
- Why?
- I retired.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.592
Retired?

52:59.718 --> 53:01.719
Yeah?

53:04.390 --> 53:09.894
So when'd they start giving retired people
meat instead of watches, Paulie?

53:12.106 --> 53:14.440
I don't need a watch.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.777
I got a watch!

53:17.903 --> 53:20.780
- You gave me a watch!
- Paulie...

53:20.906 --> 53:23.783
I don't need a goddamn watch.

53:25.119 --> 53:27.787
- Yo, Paulie.
- I got a watch!

53:29.623 --> 53:31.624
I got two watches!

53:32.126 --> 53:34.127
Yo, Paulie!

53:46.390 --> 53:49.100
Yo, Paulie.

53:49.143 --> 53:50.810
Rock.

53:50.936 --> 53:57.233
It takes guts to climb back in that ring
knowin' you're gonna take a beating.

53:58.193 --> 54:03.489
- You're gonna do all right, Rocko.
- How do you know that?

54:03.574 --> 54:06.367
The stuff in the basement.

54:17.004 --> 54:19.005
Thanks, Paulie.

54:23.636 --> 54:25.637
OK?

54:27.848 --> 54:30.099
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah. Good. How are you?

54:30.184 --> 54:34.771
- Oh, yeah, fine. This is great.
- Some guys over there wanna talk to you.

54:34.855 --> 54:36.856
- OK.
- OK?

54:41.028 --> 54:43.696
- Thanks for comin' by.
- No problem. Our pleasure.

54:43.822 --> 54:46.532
- You wanna hear some stories?
- What kind?

54:46.617 --> 54:50.536
- A lot of people like to hear fight stories.
- Maybe later.

54:50.621 --> 54:55.041
I'm Lou DiBella. This is LC Luco.
He's Mason Dixon's manager.

54:55.167 --> 54:58.044
- Will you sit down and join us?
- Sure.

54:59.463 --> 55:03.883
We have the promotional contract for
Mason Dixon - who's a big fan, by the way.

55:04.009 --> 55:07.053
When he heard you were interested
in fighting, he thought,

55:07.179 --> 55:13.226
why not try and work something out? Like
a special event, a first-class exhibition fight.

55:13.268 --> 55:15.895
- Why me?
- He respects the hell outta you.

55:15.938 --> 55:20.900
And that computer fight got people curious.
This could be very interesting.

55:21.026 --> 55:24.362
But I ain't interested in getting
mangled and embarrassed.

55:24.405 --> 55:26.698
No, that's not gonna happen. Never.

55:26.740 --> 55:33.246
Truthfully, I was thinkin'
more on a, like, minuscule small level.

55:33.288 --> 55:36.207
You know, small fights.
Not big fights. Small fights.

55:36.250 --> 55:39.419
Things that... Local.
You know what I mean? Not...

55:39.503 --> 55:41.754
Not a bad idea.
But don't think of it as big.

55:41.797 --> 55:45.258
Think of it like an exhibition,
as a glorified sparring session.

55:45.300 --> 55:49.470
And here's something you'll like -
we'll donate a portion of the gate to charity.

55:49.596 --> 55:53.599
- Well, that's always nice.
- It's good to give.

55:53.726 --> 55:55.810
- Where is it taking place?
- Las Vegas.

55:55.894 --> 56:00.189
Las Vegas. Nice and warm.
This cold's gotta be killin' you.

56:00.274 --> 56:01.274
A little stiff.

56:01.358 --> 56:03.860
- You move better when you're warmer.
- Yeah.

56:03.944 --> 56:07.613
And if nothing else,
you'll have new stories to tell.

56:07.656 --> 56:10.616
- I really gotta think about this.
- Absolutely.

56:10.659 --> 56:12.952
- Is that OK?
- I understand. No problem.

56:13.037 --> 56:16.664
- I'm gonna go. You can order something.
- What do you recommend?

56:16.790 --> 56:18.958
It's all edible.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.712
OK. Thanks.

56:24.006 --> 56:27.800
We got him. Imagine if Dixon
met this bastard in his prime.

56:27.843 --> 56:29.635
- He'd kill him.
- No kiddin'.

56:30.971 --> 56:32.972
Man, I'm confused.

56:40.606 --> 56:45.276
- I didn't think this would come along.
- But this is what you wanted, right?

56:45.319 --> 56:49.155
You know, I talk and I talk and sometimes
I think what I'm saying is true,

56:49.239 --> 56:53.618
and then, you know, I look at myself
and I'm not even sure what is true any more

56:53.660 --> 56:58.498
cos it's like I push this crazy idea about
fightin'... I mean, what's it all about?

56:58.540 --> 57:01.626
Do I care about standin' toe-to-toe
and all that stuff?

57:01.668 --> 57:05.379
Or like my kid says, is it just, like, ego?

57:05.506 --> 57:09.342
Or am I this old pug who's just tryin'
to replace old pain with new pain?

57:09.384 --> 57:12.053
I don't know. I-I don't know.

57:13.764 --> 57:16.682
Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.

57:16.767 --> 57:20.895
I'm always listenin' and lookin' and...

57:21.021 --> 57:25.191
But, you know, who you are, you know,
the part of you that's so full of life,

57:25.234 --> 57:28.236
I mean, we all have that feeling, that fire,

57:28.362 --> 57:32.865
but we usually never get a chance to use it
and then it just goes away.

57:32.950 --> 57:36.702
But you can.
You've got this opportunity, so do it.

57:36.829 --> 57:42.333
Why not? I mean, this is who you are,
you know? This is who you'll always be.

57:42.376 --> 57:45.920
And you don't move aside for nobody
until you're ready to move.

57:46.046 --> 57:48.881
And it doesn't matter
how this looks to other people.

57:49.007 --> 57:52.718
All that matters is how it looks to you.

57:53.387 --> 57:55.888
Rocky.

57:55.973 --> 57:58.933
Rocky, look at me.

57:59.393 --> 58:02.812
How it looks to you.

58:03.772 --> 58:08.067
And if this is something that you wanna do
and if this is something that you gotta do,

58:08.152 --> 58:10.486
then you do it.

58:11.405 --> 58:13.739
Fighters fight.

58:16.827 --> 58:19.453
You're not gonna punch me, are you?

58:22.791 --> 58:27.920
All right, listen. I gotta go before I wear out
my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.173
Thanks.

58:40.017 --> 58:41.976
Fighters fight, right?

58:48.609 --> 58:52.486
It's rare when you get to promote an event
that's bigger than boxing. This is.

58:52.613 --> 58:56.574
Skill versus will,
with part of the proceeds going to charity.

58:56.617 --> 59:00.912
The brainchild of Mason Dixon,
to honour past heavyweight champions.

59:00.954 --> 59:05.374
Warriors like Rocky Balboa.
Let's open it up for questions.

59:05.459 --> 59:09.837
A few great fighters have fought
in their 50s with disastrous results.

59:09.963 --> 59:14.342
Why risk the danger and embarrassment?
The smart money says you have no chance.

59:14.468 --> 59:19.764
A puncher always has a chance.
This fight will be competitive.

59:19.806 --> 59:21.974
Why are you doing this, Rocky?

59:22.059 --> 59:26.312
I don't know.
I'd rather do something I love badly than...

59:26.396 --> 59:31.817
Than... than to feel bad
by not doin' something you love.

59:31.860 --> 59:34.487
The press has labelled you
a Balboasaurus.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.990
How do you feel about that?

59:38.033 --> 59:42.328
Mason, say the following happens.
You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.

59:42.371 --> 59:45.873
You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
you'll be the joke of the decade.

59:45.999 --> 59:48.209
You all know that'd never happen.

59:48.335 --> 59:54.674
This is only an exhibition. Don't go tryin'
to make more of this than that computer tried.

59:54.716 --> 59:58.386
Isn't this sport in enough trouble
without circus events?

59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.346
Next question.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:04.642
This looks like a cheap bit
of ring theatre between a has-been

01:00:04.685 --> 01:00:08.020
and a man whose own credible legacy
and popularity is in doubt.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.898
- What's the upside?
- Doubt? Upside?

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:13.901
I mean... What do you mean, upside?

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.362
I mean, what do I have to do?

01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:21.200
I'm 33 and 0, with 30 knockouts.
I'm doin' you people a favour.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:25.204
I'm havin' this exhibition for you,
and you gonna make a mockery out of me?

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm the champ. I mean,
I get pissed, this guy get hurt.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.627
See you at the fight.

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:39.510
The guy's a joke.
He's gonna get crushed.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.686
Oh, look who's here.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:52.857
- How you doin'? Have you seen my father?
- He's in the back.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:55.359
We've never served this many meals.

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:59.530
And you're doin' good?
You're enjoyin' everything, right?

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.576
Excuse me.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:06.912
How you doin'?

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.874
- Glad you come by.
- Can I talk with you?

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.710
- Sure.
- Can we do it outside?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:20.551
- You're going through with this?
- I start training tomorrow.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.846
Hey, Rock.
I made some connections.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:27.433
I can make some money on this.
Endorsements.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.602
- Absolutely. Do that.
- Thank you.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.104
- Sure.
- OK.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:35.608
- So you nervous about the fight?
- Yeah, scared to death.

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.569
- You don't look scared.
- Well, I ain't supposed to.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.113
Then you don't have to do it.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:43.407
Yeah, well, I think I do.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:49.872
You know, living with you,
it hasn't been easy.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.625
People see me but they think of you.

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:55.586
With this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.671
- It don't have to be.
- Sure it does.

01:01:57.756 --> 01:02:00.591
- Why? You got a lot goin' on, kid.
- What, my last name?

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:05.054
That's the reason I got a decent job,
why people deal with me in the first place.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:10.976
Now I start to get a little ahead, to get a little
something for myself, and this happens.

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:14.939
Now, I'm asking you as a favour
not to go through with this, OK?

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:17.817
This is only gonna end up
bad for you and bad for me.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.694
- You think I'm hurtin' you?
- Yeah. In a way you are.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:24.698
- It's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
- I know that's not what you wanna do,

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:28.327
but that's just the way that it is.
Don't you care what people think?

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:32.998
Doesn't it bother you that people make you
out to be a joke and I'll be included in that?

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.084
Do you think that's right?

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.253
Do you?

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.760
You ain't gonna believe this,

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:47.263
but you used to fit right here.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.598
I'd hold you up and say to your mother:

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.351
"This kid's gonna be
the best kid in the world. "

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:55.813
"This kid's gonna be somebody
better than anybody ever knew. "

01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:58.774
And you grew up good and wonderful.

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:02.194
It was great just watching.
Every day was like a privilege.

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:06.365
Then the time come for you to be your own
man and take on the world, and you did.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:11.495
But somewhere along the line,
you changed. You stopped bein' you.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:15.082
You let people stick a finger in your face
and tell you you're no good,

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.878
and when things got hard, you started
lookin' for somethin' to blame.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.921
Like a big shadow.

01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:27.386
I'll tell you something you already know.
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:31.390
It's a very mean and nasty place.
And I don't care how tough you are,

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:35.603
it will beat you to your knees
and keep you there permanently if you let it.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:39.857
You, me, or nobody
is gonna hit as hard as life.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.026
But it ain't about how hard you hit.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:45.738
It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep movin' forward.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:49.074
How much you can take
and keep movin' forward.

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:51.911
That's how winnin' is done!

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:54.830
If you know what you're worth,
get what you're worth,

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:58.334
but you gotta be willin' to take the hits
and not pointin' fingers,

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:02.588
sayin' you ain't where you wanna be
because of him or her or anybody!

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.840
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:06.967
You're better than that!

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.977
I'm always gonna love you no matter what,

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.271
no matter what happens.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:22.441
You're my son and you're my blood.

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:25.152
You're the best thing in my life.

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:32.451
But until you start believin' in yourself,
you ain't gonna have a life.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.957
Don't forget to visit your mother.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:30.134
- Yeah, those are beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:35.180
- You get off early from work?
- No.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.475
I left. I quit.

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:42.605
Quit? Why?

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:45.566
I wasn't very...

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:50.779
I don't know. I just...
I didn't... I didn't fit in there.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:53.324
I understand.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.164
- So what are you gonna do?
- Right now?

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.085
Right now I'd rather be with you.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:08.881
That all right?

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.800
Yeah.

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:16.221
It's been a long time since I've seen a fight.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:32.237
You know all about fightin' so there's
no sense us goin' down that road again.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.074
To beat this guy, you need speed.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:38.202
You don't have it.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:41.955
And your knees can't take the poundin',
so hard runnin' is out.

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:44.083
And you got arthritis in your neck,

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:47.836
and you've got calcium deposits
on most of your joints,

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.255
so sparrin' is out.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.466
I had that problem.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:57.763
So what we'll be callin' on
is good old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.

01:06:57.889 --> 01:07:02.768
Horsepower. Heavy-duty, cast-iron,
pile-drivin' punches

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:06.438
that will have to hurt so much
they'll rattle his ancestors.

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:12.653
Every time you hit him with a shot, it's gotta
feel like he tried kissin' the express train.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:16.615
Yeah! Let's start buildin'
some hurtin' bombs.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:53.152
- You'll get it. You'll get it.
- You can do it, Rocko.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.854
Gettin' stronger!

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.582
Come on, Rocko!

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.258
Come on, come on.
There you go.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:08:59.885
There you go.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:06.725
You can do it, Rocko.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:10.938
Gettin' stronger!

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.648
Three.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:14.399
Four. Five.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.600
Yeah!

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:02.781
Rocky Balboa, 217.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:07.411
The undisputed heavyweight champion
Mason Dixon,

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:10.414
221.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:17.713
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:34.396
- You know how much money is in this?
- A lot.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.816
Imagine tryin' to clean this place.
No, seriously.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.943
Balboa.

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:44.907
You guys, I'll catch up with you all later, OK?

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.451
Robert, I want you to hang with me.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.830
- How you doin', champ?
- I'm good.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.417
There's no reason
for neither one of us to get hurt.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:11:00.631
I'll do my best to carry you, make sure
you save face. There'd be no embarrassment.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:03.717
But I promise you, if you try to press me,

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:10.182
you hit me, you hurt me, you hit me low,
cheap-shot me, I'll get you outta there.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:14.394
You know, a lot of people
come to Vegas to lose. I didn't.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.981
- It's already over.
- Ain't nothin' over till it's over.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:22.444
- What's that from? The '80s?
- That's probably the '70s.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:28.200
Just remember what I said.

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:30.327
Hey, yo, champ.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:33.038
Yo, ain't you a little scared?

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.998
I don't get scared.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:44.341
I think you try a little harder when you're
scared. This is what has worked for me.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:47.386
- I ain't scared.
- You ain't scared of me?

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:51.556
Come on, let's see what you got.
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.074
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.868
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No. You wanna come in?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.412
No. It's OK.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:18.709
I just wanted to - I don't know - come by
and wish you good luck for tomorrow.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:22.629
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Um... I brought you something.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:27.300
I hope you don't mind.
I took it from the restaurant.

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:29.261
Adrian.

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:31.972
Yeah. I thought she would
keep you safe, you know.

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:36.768
- Yeah, she always brought me luck.
- Yeah.

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:43.066
Yeah. Listen, I wanted to say thanks
for everything you've done for me and my kid.

01:12:43.151 --> 01:12:44.943
You've been great.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.533
You know, tomorrow...

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:58.790
you're gonna prove that the last thing
to age in somebody is their heart.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.084
- I'll try.
- You go show 'em.

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:03.211
Thank you.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.861
The heavyweight championship
has been one of sport's most coveted titles

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.821
for 120 years.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:33.784
Two-time heavyweight champion
Rocky Balboa, the Philadelphia slugger,

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:39.206
renowned for his cast-iron jaw,
ferocious body attack and will of steel,

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:42.626
which have carried the smaller fighter
to numerous victories

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.504
against physically superior opponents.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:48.507
And Mason Dixon,
the current heavyweight title holder,

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.802
with all the speed and determination
any fighter could want.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:56.014
But many still question whether
he has the heart of a true champion,

01:13:56.099 --> 01:14:00.685
never having been pushed to go the distance.
Tonight, we find out.

01:14:00.812 --> 01:14:04.147
We're at the Mandalay Bay Events Center
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:08.235
for the much-anticipated showdown
between Mason "The Line" Dixon

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:11.738
and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:14.658
I'm Jim Lampley, with Larry Merchant
and Max Kellerman,

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.993
live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas,

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:21.623
where we anticipate one of the most
compelling events in boxing history -

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:25.377
the current unappreciated
heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon,

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:27.379
putting his reputation on the line

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:31.508
against legendary ex-ex-ex-champion,
Rocky Balboa.

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:34.886
Even though most see this
as a glorified sparring session,

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.013
the energy in the room is electric.

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.266
Why is this billed as an exhibition?

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:43.311
A wild guess - so they wouldn't
have to call it an execution.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:51.069
Zechariah 4:6 says, "It is not by strength,
not by might, but by his Spirit. "

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:56.825
We have already claimed the victory
in our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:15:01.079
- Good luck, Rocky.
- Thanks, Spider. I appreciate it.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:16.553
Nobody's expecting much, I think,
from the way-past-his-prime former champ

01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:17.762
Rocky Balboa.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:21.516
Rock, I gotta talk to you.

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:28.940
Look. Look, I know you got a lot of stuff
you gotta get out of your system, huh?

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:31.276
Tonight you do it. Right?

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:33.695
Get rid of the damn beast.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:36.615
Let it be done once and for all.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:39.242
Please, I love you.

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:53.632
There go the lights. The buzz is building
toward a roaring crescendo.

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:10.607
Where'd that come from?

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.652
I chose it. I love Sinatra.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:16.404
He's very good, Sinatra.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:18.698
- Let's go.
- Very good.

01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:26.248
And here comes Rocky Balboa,
a veteran of the wars,

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.084
here for one more last hurrah.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:32.212
Or the Last Supper,
with him as the main course.

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:35.006
What's that music?
You can't be serious.

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:38.009
"High Hopes"?
Talk about wishful thinking.

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:42.222
Maybe "no hopes" is more realistic.
Anyway, the crowd likes it.

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:45.684
Look at the Italian Stallion!
Cool and relaxed.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:49.521
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog
and they don't care at all.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:53.692
This is about his pride
and dignity and his punch, guys.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.361
The last thing to go is a guy's punch.

01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:59.864
Rocky always has that puncher's chance.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:08.248
Rocky Balboa is still,
as you can hear, the people's champion.

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:12.752
Prediction - for two rounds,
Dixon's gonna have his hands full.

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:17.924
Two whole rounds?
We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:21.553
- How you doin'?
- The crowd wants to see something real.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:26.433
Jim, Rocky Balboa just asked me how
I'm doing. Now, I grew up watching this guy.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:29.227
I never thought I'd be calling one of his fights.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.938
This is unbelievable.
I'm a fan. I can't help it.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:34.858
Now here comes Mason Dixon.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.644
Dixon establishing
his presence in the ring,

01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:15.440
and suddenly now a conversation
breaking out at the ringside.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.276
Mike Tyson calling out
Mason "The Line" Dixon.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:23.782
- You can't call the shots. I'm the champ.
- You're not doin' nothin'. This is charity!

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:28.787
And you got that...
you got that midget with you right there.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.208
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:36.127
welcome to the Mandalay Bay Resort

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:39.130
and Casino of Las Vegas,

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:42.801
and a special main event of the evening,

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:46.137
ten rounds of heavyweight excitement

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.932
sanctioned by
the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:54.479
And when the bell rings, the referee
in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.

01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:57.816
And now, for the thousands in attendance

01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:01.694
and the millions watching around the world,

01:19:01.821 --> 01:19:03.863
ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:09.494
let's get ready to rumble!

01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:16.584
Introducing first, fighting out of
the blue corner, wearing black with gold,

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:19.963
official weight 217lb.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:22.882
His professional record: 57 victories,

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:27.929
including 54 knockouts,
with 23 defeats and one draw.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:31.349
He is the fighting pride of Philadelphia,

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:35.895
the two-time heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:38.189
"The Italian Stallion"

01:19:38.232 --> 01:19:43.194
Rocky

01:19:43.237 --> 01:19:45.405
Balboa!

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.035
I hope he gets his head busted.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:54.038
Shut up.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:01.212
Across the ring, fighting out of the red corner,
wearing white with blue,

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:03.715
official weight 221 Ib.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:06.050
He has a perfect professional record,

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:12.265
consisting of 33 bouts, 33 victories,
including 30 knockouts.

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:17.604
Originally from Tampa, Florida,
but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada,

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:22.108
the reigning, undisputed, undefeated

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:25.236
heavyweight champion of the world

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:33.161
Mason "The Line" Dixon!

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.917
All right, gentlemen.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:42.420
All right, Mason, Rocky. We went over
the rules in the dressing room.

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:44.088
I expect a good, clean fight.

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:48.593
Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches,
those low blows. Be careful with those.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:52.597
Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
Remember, I'm fair but I'm firm.

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:54.599
- Touch 'em up.
- Enjoy the ride.

01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:57.727
The champ is not in the best shape
we've seen him in.

01:20:57.811 --> 01:21:00.104
Maybe he just plans to phone this one in.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:02.607
- That wouldn't be a surprise.
- Love you.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.485
One thing about Rocky
we know for sure,

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:08.112
this guy's showing up in shape.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:11.282
- The old man's crazy.
- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:14.619
You just take it easy.
This is an exhibition. Do it to him.

01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:16.246
Three rounds to set a pace.

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:18.623
- Every time you hit him, make a dent.
- Got it.

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:23.545
The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight?
I can't believe it's here.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:29.968
Round one begins. If old George Foreman
shocked the world with one punch

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:32.220
why can't old Rocky Balboa?

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:34.931
As much excitement
as there is in the arena,

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:37.267
there's a sense of foreboding as well.

01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:45.233
And now Mason "The Line" Dixon
goes to work with his jab,

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:49.279
as though he's fighting the number one
challenger in the heavyweight division.

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.656
This is to be expected early on.

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:57.954
You knew the champ was gonna control the
distance with his jab, his height, his range.

01:21:57.997 --> 01:22:01.249
Balboa, looking to get in a shot,
misses wildly!

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.626
Did you like that?

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:07.005
It looks like a speed bag
against a punching bag.

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:11.050
Rocky's frustrated - he came
out of retirement to get into a fight.

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:15.805
Guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed
with. One punch could turn it around.

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:19.392
Apparently he forgot
his arthritis meds this morning.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.227
Rocky misses!

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:25.023
There's a meat-seeking missile
on the point of the chin by the champ.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:27.900
More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.

01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:31.195
There's a hard right hand,
a left and a right by Balboa.

01:22:31.322 --> 01:22:34.741
He drives Dixon into the ropes
with a series of shots.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:37.201
And the crowd goes berserk.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:47.211
Dixon punishing Balboa
for the temerity of landing those shots.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:55.219
It's toe-to-toe in the corner,
Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:05.730
Balboa landing potent combinations to the
champion's head. A wake-up call for Dixon.

01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:07.273
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:08.983
- Sit down.
- Bricks in his glove.

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:11.736
- What happened to the angry stuff?
- It's still there.

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:14.572
Yeah, well, he came to battle, OK?
Listen to me.

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:17.784
If there's any bone in your body
he can break, he'll do it.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:19.577
Give the man a little respect.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:22.622
Compubox numbers
tell the grisly story here.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:26.042
Balboa landed nine of 13 punches
in that round.

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:31.214
Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:32.423
Listen to me.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:35.051
Rocky's been here
a million times before -

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:39.430
coming out to start another round
after he took a beating in the previous one.

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:41.599
I warned him. I warned him.

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:47.522
Well, he's tired.
His legs are going fast or already gone.

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:52.360
And what's truly extraordinary
is that Rocky can still take it!

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:56.948
The boxing commission, which, remember,
was criticised for licensing him,

01:23:57.032 --> 01:24:01.452
would be massacred
if something happened to Rocky.

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:07.125
A monstrous straight left hand!

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:10.461
Down goes Rocky,
and that could be the end of the fight.

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:14.382
That could be the exhibition right there.
But no, Balboa up,

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.845
as referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants
to continue and Rocky says yes.

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:21.889
Even Balboa can be too brave
for his own good.

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:25.935
Dixon comes right back to try to finish it.
Balboa almost went down.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.979
Rocky shoves Dixon back.

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:30.481
As Dixon lands these brutal shots.

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:31.816
Cover up!

01:24:31.859 --> 01:24:36.279
Open shots at close range,
right and left hands, and down goes Balboa,

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:39.449
perhaps for the last time
in his fighting career.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:43.035
- That should do it.
- Three! Four! Five!

01:24:43.162 --> 01:24:44.495
Six! Seven!

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:47.665
- Get up! Get up!
- Eight!

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:51.002
Nine!
How do you feel? You OK?

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:55.965
Now Rocky, furious with himself,
convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting.

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:59.927
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it,
Rocky saying he's fine.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:02.972
- He wants to go on.
- Let it go! Let it go!

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:06.350
And Balboa comes back
with a left and a right,

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:10.521
and bulls Dixon into the ropes
for the second round in a row.

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:15.610
Back comes Dixon with brutal left-hand shots.
Dixon hurt his hand!

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:18.404
- Go after him!
- This is Rocky's chance.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.032
The champ just hurt his hand on Rocky's hip.

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:24.744
Balboa immediately going to work
to the body. Huge right hook.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:27.705
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body.

01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:30.208
These are big punches.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:35.004
Yes!

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:41.886
Rocky Balboa has knocked
the reigning heavyweight champion down!

01:25:41.929 --> 01:25:43.262
You hurt him!

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:48.518
Mason Dixon has never taken
this kind of punishment in his entire career.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.688
Maybe he's clearing his head,
but the body shots really caved in his ribs.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:55.733
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:59.153
Another counter hook by Balboa.
Followed by two more!

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:02.240
Dixon fires back his own hooks.
Rocky's stunned.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.617
It's an all-out war along the ropes,

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:10.331
as round two comes to a close
amid a giant tumult in the ring.

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.083
Incredible.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:14.085
Yeah, all right!

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:16.921
Welcome to Rockyland.

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:22.927
- How's the hand?
- My hand's broken.

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.639
If we lose, it's your ass. Your ass!

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:29.559
It'll numb up on you.
It'll numb up in three rounds.

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:32.937
Once that hand numbs up,
Dixon's gonna be able to throw it hard.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:37.275
- Until then, here's Rocky's chance.
- Take it to him! No reverse!

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:39.151
Take the pain, champ.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:43.114
Everybody thought this was a joke,
including me. Now nobody's laughing!

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.616
You go get him! Go out strong!

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.631
Keep him off you.

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:05.303
That's it! That's it!

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:21.652
You won that round.
Break him down.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:28.659
Bomb him! Bomb him!

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:37.001
Yeah!

01:27:39.338 --> 01:27:42.089
Just keep throwin' them bombs.

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:54.518
Come on.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:04.195
You can do this.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.365
Rocky! Rocky!

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.376
Get him! Go!

01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:18.269
Go through him.
Run over him.

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:35.161
Unload on him!

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:38.456
Dig down, Mason!

01:29:49.176 --> 01:29:53.387
- They're leaving nothing on the table.
- The fans are standing.

01:29:53.472 --> 01:29:55.848
They may not be able to sit down for a week.

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:58.851
- You're doin' great.
- I'm doin' better than I thought.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:02.813
- Are you sure he's OK?
- I've had worse.

01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:06.776
Toe-to-toe, one round to go.
Who would have believed this was possible?

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.779
- Can you see outta that eye?
- Let me talk. Look at me.

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:14.909
Don't take any more chances out there than
you have to. There's nothing more to prove.

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:18.871
- I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
- You can do it, Rocko!

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:21.457
- One more round, we go home.
- OK, then do it.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:27.254
There's a saying that every great champion
has one great fight left in him,

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:30.591
and Rocky is proving it so far.

01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:35.721
- Come on. Touch 'em up.
- The last round of your life! The last round!

01:30:35.806 --> 01:30:38.849
Come on. Touch 'em up.
Let's go. Touch 'em up.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:42.311
- You're one crazy old man.
- You'll get there.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:43.354
Let's go.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.484
Tenth round of a scheduled ten.
Who would have dreamed that Rocky Balboa

01:30:48.527 --> 01:30:53.489
would still be in this "exhibition" against
the heavyweight champion of the world?

01:30:53.532 --> 01:30:54.907
You can do it! Come on!

01:30:54.991 --> 01:31:00.287
This fight is as though Dixon
got on-the-job training in courage.

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:03.290
- Cover up!
- They're both in a pain-free zone.

01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:06.210
These guys are fighting
in another dimension now.

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:11.048
Beyond belief! Balboa just walking
straight into Dixon's punches.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:14.051
Target practice for Dixon.

01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:20.683
They're exchanging right hooks.
Here comes Dixon!

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:24.061
He's exhausted from punching the man.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:26.730
Knock this bum out, Mace!

01:31:38.869 --> 01:31:42.913
What is it you said to the kid?
It ain't about how hard you hit.

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:47.293
It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep movin' forward.

01:31:47.377 --> 01:31:51.046
How much you can take
and keep movin' forward.

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:55.092
- Get up.
- Let's go! Get up!

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:58.053
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.096
Get up.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:04.602
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:25.497
Another monster body shot.
Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:29.126
- Start movin' those hands!
- Less than two minutes to go.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:31.670
The crowd is astonished that Balboa got up.

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:34.673
- Come on! Come on!
- Turn it over! All the way through!

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:37.301
.. and retaliates with fury!

01:32:39.763 --> 01:32:42.139
Chop him down!

01:32:44.643 --> 01:32:46.477
Come on, Rocky! Come on!

01:32:48.772 --> 01:32:50.481
Take him out now!

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:53.817
They're trading shots again.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:58.280
Balboa's trying to hit
anything and anywhere!

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:01.116
Win it! Win it!

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:10.459
Yes!

01:33:20.387 --> 01:33:23.347
- You're a great champion. You got heart.
- Thanks.

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:27.184
Thanks for the opportunity.
Good man.

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:33.357
That was unbelievable.
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

01:33:33.483 --> 01:33:36.318
That's the kind of pride
you're talking about.

01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:40.030
Hey, Paulie.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:42.866
The beast is gone now.
The beast is out.

01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:46.787
One of the most overused words in sports,
guys, is "incredible".

01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:51.333
I hate to say it, this is incredible.

01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:54.336
Let's go!

01:33:57.132 --> 01:34:00.801
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go to the score cards,

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:06.724
a round of applause
for these two heavyweight warriors.

01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:15.190
We have a split decision.

01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:24.074
Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94 Dixon.

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:31.874
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94 Balboa.

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:45.095
And Bill Graham scores it 95-94

01:34:45.221 --> 01:34:47.765
for the winner by split decision,

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:50.351
and still undefeated,

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:53.354
the heavyweight champion of the world

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:59.777
Mason "The Line" Dixon!

01:35:56.334 --> 01:36:00.462
You know I couldn't have done nothin'
without you.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.924
Yo, Adrian, we did it.

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:13.350
We did it.
