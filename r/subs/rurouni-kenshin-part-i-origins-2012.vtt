WEBVTT

00:18.436 --> 00:24.567
As the days of the samurai ended
and the Shogun's government faded

00:26.444 --> 00:32.575
an assassin called "Battosai",
or "Pure Drawn Sword"

00:34.452 --> 00:39.248
roamed the streets of Kyoto,
terrorising the Shogun's forces

00:39.373 --> 00:44.128
with cold-blooded,
almost supernatural strength.

00:46.922 --> 00:53.471
The "Boshin War" brought Japan
to the verge of its modern age.

01:14.366 --> 01:18.537
January 1868

01:18.662 --> 01:24.418
The Battle of Toba-Fushimi

01:47.566 --> 01:50.528
There! The Shogun's men!

02:00.663 --> 02:04.291
<i>Battosai the Killer! Where are you?</i>

02:05.084 --> 02:06.168
<i>Where are you?</i>

02:18.639 --> 02:21.225
Saito! The Shogun's dog!

02:21.350 --> 02:22.393
En garde!

02:48.419 --> 02:49.879
<i>Come on, Battosai!</i>

03:46.602 --> 03:48.103
We've won!

03:48.771 --> 03:51.106
It's the Emperor's banner!

03:52.191 --> 03:55.194
You are now rebels
against His Majesty!

03:59.990 --> 04:02.618
We've won!

04:10.793 --> 04:15.339
So it's come, has it?
The new age...

04:22.179 --> 04:23.764
At last.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.149
Battosai!

04:47.413 --> 04:49.164
It doesn't end here.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.543
Though the world may change,

04:53.460 --> 04:54.545
men like us

04:55.546 --> 04:58.090
still live and die by the sword.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.613
<i>Why?</i>

06:05.074 --> 06:07.618
<i>Why have I been left alive?</i>

06:32.017 --> 06:34.436
<i>This sword...</i>

06:59.378 --> 07:02.089
<i>Could this belong to Battosai?</i>

07:31.326 --> 07:38.625
Tokyo, 1878

07:38.792 --> 07:41.253
General Yamagata will speak!

07:44.006 --> 07:45.132
Salute!

07:50.554 --> 07:51.638
As you were!

07:53.390 --> 07:55.350
Over the past 10 years,

07:55.851 --> 08:00.189
Japan has taken the Western powers
as an example

08:00.522 --> 08:03.025
and walked a new path.

08:07.196 --> 08:12.367
<i>The new government's authority
has spread far and wide,</i>

08:13.327 --> 08:18.457
<i>bringing our land
prosperity and security.</i>

08:24.463 --> 08:28.592
The age when fear and violence
held sway

08:28.967 --> 08:30.928
is over!

08:31.178 --> 08:32.346
Salute!

08:44.024 --> 08:47.236
People are weak.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.990
They pay lip service to fine ideals,

08:52.699 --> 08:58.413
but there are three things
for which they become beasts.

09:00.666 --> 09:05.420
For themselves, for money

09:07.339 --> 09:10.425
and for pleasure.

09:18.684 --> 09:19.935
Excuse me.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.359
You've done it.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.779
Good job, Megumi.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.781
Thank you.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.285
This new type of opium

09:37.077 --> 09:40.664
will turn people into animals.

09:40.831 --> 09:41.957
You may go.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.884
We only need one person
who knows the process.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.847
Eeny, meeny,

11:21.390 --> 11:23.767
miny mo.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.936
Which one

11:26.228 --> 11:28.355
will it be?

11:28.480 --> 11:33.485
Let's let God decide.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.865
Thank you!

12:21.283 --> 12:22.451
Come on!

12:22.617 --> 12:23.910
Let him go!

12:26.288 --> 12:27.622
Leave him

12:29.207 --> 12:31.710
to Battosai.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.884
Toasted dumplings!
Get 'em while they're hot!

13:21.051 --> 13:22.344
One, please.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.516
Justification for Execution

13:36.733 --> 13:39.194
He was an undercover officer.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.366
A warning.

13:45.784 --> 13:50.080
"Battosai the Killer" again?
Why does he leave these things?

13:51.540 --> 13:52.666
It's not him.

13:55.293 --> 13:59.214
The "Justification" should say
why you've killed someone.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.300
This doesn't.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.719
It's not Battosai's style.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.602
Huh?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.739
"Battosai the Killer"?

14:26.408 --> 14:29.744
Of the Kamiya School?
"invigorate the heart"?

14:31.580 --> 14:32.747
You!

14:35.083 --> 14:38.128
The Edict says "no swords",
and you've got one.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.256
You're Battosai!

14:42.799 --> 14:46.219
Your evil deeds end here.
En garde!

14:46.303 --> 14:49.764
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! Wait!

14:53.935 --> 14:55.228
I'm not him!

15:14.998 --> 15:21.296
Your humble servant is naught
but a poor wanderer.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.639
You believe me?

15:32.557 --> 15:34.809
Then why do you have that sword?

15:37.145 --> 15:39.022
This is a back-blade.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.192
A "back-blade"?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.777
See?

15:47.280 --> 15:52.452
The cutting edge is on the back.
The opposite to a normal sword.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.795
That won't kill...

16:03.338 --> 16:04.756
No.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.850
I thank you.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.818
Who is that man?

16:29.197 --> 16:33.243
He claims to be
from my fencing school.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.370
He kills people and leaves letters.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.206
Just like in the old days.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.314
Huh?

17:10.488 --> 17:11.865
Sir!

17:19.204 --> 17:20.874
A visitor.

17:35.221 --> 17:40.727
I'm surprised a police officer
would come calling alone.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.315
Care for one?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.907
What's that?

17:54.157 --> 17:58.828
Someone calling himself "Battosai"
has killed an undercover officer.

18:00.497 --> 18:06.211
The ghost of a samurai comes back
10 years later as a murderer?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.421
Your Shinbashi warehouse...

18:08.755 --> 18:12.717
That warehouse?
We're not using it right now.

18:13.009 --> 18:17.722
We wanted it for imported goods,
but things haven't worked out.

18:18.098 --> 18:23.228
If you really want to search it,
there are procedures to follow.

18:23.645 --> 18:27.440
Officials can no longer
do as they wish

18:27.857 --> 18:29.442
in the new age.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.450
Don't push me.

18:39.744 --> 18:43.456
That ghost may not realise
times have changed.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.962
Food!

19:02.058 --> 19:04.561
Look at that bunch.

19:05.145 --> 19:09.774
Former samurai,
cut adrift in the new Japan.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.695
I've hired them
to keep them from starving.

19:13.862 --> 19:18.491
They're men who can fight.
Left alone, they'd cause chaos.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.996
You never know
what a hungry dog will bite.

19:31.671 --> 19:36.509
But looking at you, I'd say
you used to be a samurai, too.

19:36.801 --> 19:37.844
I still am.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.721
That's why I don't like you.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.347
Careful.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.935
They say cops wait for evidence,
but I don't.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.616
Sir! Megumi's gone!

20:04.120 --> 20:06.873
What? She got away?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.376
We've got a cop on the take.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.381
He says a woman
came to them for protection.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.898
Damn that woman!

20:33.274 --> 20:36.069
Don't worry about it!

20:36.361 --> 20:40.240
If she talks about the opium,
she's guilty, too.

20:40.615 --> 20:46.079
Once a woman falls that low,
you never know what she'll do.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.581
How would you know?

20:49.290 --> 20:50.875
What?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.418
I know women!

20:52.585 --> 20:53.711
Shut up!

20:56.923 --> 21:00.927
Get that woman back here
right away.

21:04.681 --> 21:05.723
Hands off!

21:05.932 --> 21:07.100
What do you want?

21:08.977 --> 21:10.103
I'll do her.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.277
Don't kill her, Jine.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.949
She's the only one who knows
how to make Spiderweb.

21:26.536 --> 21:28.454
Do what you have to...

21:29.789 --> 21:31.708
Battosai.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.968
Look, you came to us.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.305
Tell us what's going on.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.269
<i>I</i> give up.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.788
What's happening?

22:11.664 --> 22:12.790
That Way!

22:15.001 --> 22:16.044
This way!

22:16.127 --> 22:17.754
Move!

22:30.058 --> 22:31.309
Battosai?

22:31.809 --> 22:32.977
Come quietly!

22:47.200 --> 22:48.242
What happened?

22:51.287 --> 22:52.538
Who are you?

22:53.247 --> 22:54.457
Don't move!

22:55.041 --> 22:56.209
Halt!

23:31.494 --> 23:32.870
This isn't magic.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.876
It's a technique.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.170
My sword-spirit

23:41.712 --> 23:46.384
uses your fear to paralyse you.
It's called "one side of the soul".

23:49.345 --> 23:50.763
Can't breathe?

23:52.932 --> 23:56.102
The more you fear,
the worse it gets.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.937
A cat!

24:43.441 --> 24:46.819
Hi, kitty!

25:04.420 --> 25:06.839
Hey...

25:18.851 --> 25:19.894
Stop!

25:29.570 --> 25:31.197
You're Battosai?

25:34.617 --> 25:39.997
Why are you doing evil
in the name of the Kamiya School?

25:51.717 --> 25:53.511
It's because of you

25:54.971 --> 25:58.391
that the school my father left me...

26:04.647 --> 26:06.899
Your father? What about him?

26:08.192 --> 26:09.569
He taught

26:11.195 --> 26:12.572
that fencing

26:12.738 --> 26:13.906
celebrates life.

26:15.032 --> 26:18.494
The sword is a way of life,
not death.

26:22.999 --> 26:26.377
A woman challenges me
with a wooden sword?

26:26.627 --> 26:27.670
Quiet!

26:31.048 --> 26:33.050
This stick won't help you.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.518
A sword lives on blood.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.899
Die knowing that.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.243
You forgot this.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.080
Who are you?

27:05.583 --> 27:07.084
Whoever.

27:11.881 --> 27:15.801
Are you the man
who calls himself "Battosai"?

27:22.266 --> 27:23.976
Those scars...

27:26.771 --> 27:28.064
That speed...

27:34.487 --> 27:36.572
So you're the one they talk about.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.206
It doesn't work on you.

27:46.207 --> 27:47.333
We must run.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.675
Come quietly, Battosai!

27:55.841 --> 27:58.511
So it was worth surviving...

27:58.678 --> 27:59.804
Bring rope!

28:04.392 --> 28:05.601
How's your arm?

28:11.774 --> 28:13.609
Battosai!

28:13.734 --> 28:15.695
Get him!

28:16.362 --> 28:17.405
That way.

28:18.114 --> 28:19.156
This way!

28:44.140 --> 28:45.558
I'm grateful,

28:47.351 --> 28:51.647
but I wouldn't have cared
either way.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.736
You should tend to that arm.

29:25.014 --> 29:28.934
"Kaoru Kamiya,
Assistant Instructor"...

29:31.020 --> 29:34.023
It was always just a small school.

29:35.775 --> 29:41.614
But a lot of people came here
who were fond of my father.

29:50.539 --> 29:55.211
But for the last six months,
since this "Battosai" appeared,

29:57.838 --> 29:59.256
no one comes.

30:04.970 --> 30:08.265
I have to stop him,
the sooner the better.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.229
I wouldn't.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.818
He's much better than you.

30:20.694 --> 30:25.241
It's important in fencing
to know your own limits.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.994
You know what will happen
the next time you meet.

30:32.665 --> 30:39.004
The dignity of a school
is not worth your life.

30:45.261 --> 30:49.265
"Invigorate the Heart"

30:54.186 --> 30:56.522
A sword is not for killing with.

31:01.068 --> 31:04.989
The sword brings people to life.
That is the ideal of this school.

31:07.658 --> 31:09.994
To see that soiled by murder...

31:20.796 --> 31:22.548
A wanderer

31:25.009 --> 31:26.719
wouldn't understand!

31:29.263 --> 31:31.015
The sword brings life...

31:38.355 --> 31:39.398
Anyway,

31:40.316 --> 31:43.068
that arm should keep you here.

31:49.450 --> 31:54.330
I'm sure your late father
would not want his daughter

31:55.205 --> 31:58.334
to give her life for his school.

32:01.712 --> 32:02.755
Good bye.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.413
Look at this!

32:52.137 --> 32:55.432
He's declared war on us!

33:17.287 --> 33:20.666
Kamiya Fencing Dojo

33:29.425 --> 33:30.467
Wanderer?

33:34.805 --> 33:35.973
Oh, it's you...

33:36.432 --> 33:39.810
You're not happy to see
Squire Yahiko Myojin?

33:40.310 --> 33:41.812
Oh, be quiet.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.398
Give me breakfast!

33:46.984 --> 33:50.404
This hungry orphan needs a hot meal!

33:50.779 --> 33:53.741
Stop it. First we train.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.159
Get cleaning.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.346
Who are you?

34:19.099 --> 34:20.641
We want this dojo.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.436
What?

34:23.687 --> 34:25.481
You'll get a good price.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.359
A certain gentleman will pay well.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.655
It won't be a bad deal for you.

34:33.822 --> 34:34.864
What?

34:35.199 --> 34:37.409
I'm not selling my father's dojo!

34:37.493 --> 34:43.623
For just an assistant instructor,
you got a lot of nerve, honey.

34:44.291 --> 34:47.795
Especially when your Battosai
is a murderer.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.089
He's not one of us!

34:50.214 --> 34:51.255
Just let it go.

34:51.715 --> 34:55.719
Nobody comes
to this dojo now, anyway.

34:56.719 --> 34:57.805
GET busy!

35:00.432 --> 35:01.517
Don't!

35:01.725 --> 35:02.810
Stop it!

35:02.935 --> 35:04.561
Cut that out!

35:07.147 --> 35:08.190
Yahiko!

35:08.565 --> 35:10.275
Stop it, will you!

35:11.151 --> 35:12.361
Who is this kid?

35:12.486 --> 35:16.657
I am Yahiko Myojin,
defender of the weak!

35:18.283 --> 35:19.451
Let him go!

35:21.578 --> 35:22.704
Hey!

35:23.413 --> 35:25.958
Get tough first, then talk tough!

35:26.083 --> 35:27.292
Yeah!

35:28.794 --> 35:32.589
Your school says
the sword invigorates, huh?

35:33.465 --> 35:38.053
Let's see you take that sword
and invigorate yourself.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.602
Take your shoes off!

35:46.270 --> 35:48.772
The sword brings life?
You're dreaming!

35:50.149 --> 35:51.608
No shoes!

35:51.775 --> 35:54.778
Swords are for mayhem, and killing.

35:55.529 --> 35:58.157
That's what fencing is all about.

36:08.584 --> 36:09.626
Now I'm mad.

36:27.436 --> 36:28.520
Wanderer!

36:29.229 --> 36:30.272
Move!

36:32.191 --> 36:33.358
Who are you?

36:33.775 --> 36:34.818
I agree

36:36.653 --> 36:42.534
her words are those of one
whose hands are still clean.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.537
She is dreaming.

36:48.165 --> 36:52.044
The sword is a weapon
meant for killing.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.673
No fine words will change
the truth of that.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.385
But I vastly prefer

37:01.470 --> 37:06.225
Miss Kaoru's fond dreams
to that truth.

37:10.187 --> 37:11.230
Nonsense!

37:43.679 --> 37:44.721
Fight him!

37:45.722 --> 37:47.724
Go on!

37:47.891 --> 37:49.268
Fight him!

37:49.559 --> 37:51.103
Get up there!

38:42.904 --> 38:46.325
Battosai fought in
the "High Heaven" style.

38:51.580 --> 38:54.583
It is an old style,
suited to one against many.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.340
I wear this sword

39:03.800 --> 39:05.927
so that I do not kill.

39:11.058 --> 39:12.517
"'8 you!

39:46.009 --> 39:47.386
You?

39:56.228 --> 39:57.396
Kaoru!

40:00.107 --> 40:01.358
Careful!

40:01.733 --> 40:03.860
This man's dead!

40:06.405 --> 40:08.240
What's going on here?

40:08.532 --> 40:10.242
- Is that him?
- No!

40:10.700 --> 40:12.327
They attacked us.

40:12.911 --> 40:16.832
But nobody's dead.
They're just knocked out.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.583
In here!

40:19.793 --> 40:20.836
Them!

40:20.919 --> 40:21.962
Hey!

40:28.969 --> 40:31.012
Swords are illegal, you know!

40:32.180 --> 40:33.223
Take them!

40:38.437 --> 40:39.521
What happened?

40:43.733 --> 40:45.610
It was my fault.

40:47.070 --> 40:50.365
All of this happened because of me.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.869
The dojo wasn't involved.

40:57.622 --> 40:58.665
Come on!

41:01.668 --> 41:02.752
Wait!

41:03.003 --> 41:05.380
Wanderer...

41:07.841 --> 41:09.301
Yes, ma'am?

41:12.637 --> 41:14.890
At least tell me your name.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.100
Wait!

41:21.563 --> 41:23.398
Kenshin Himura.

41:23.482 --> 41:24.524
Move!

41:26.818 --> 41:27.944
"Kenshin"...

41:30.780 --> 41:32.407
"The heart of the sword"?

41:46.755 --> 41:47.797
Open up!

41:49.549 --> 41:50.592
New prisoner.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.139
Move!

42:51.903 --> 42:52.946
Open up!

43:11.423 --> 43:13.049
Scars in a cross...

43:18.221 --> 43:19.889
So it is you.

43:22.225 --> 43:23.435
It's been a while,

43:25.228 --> 43:26.605
Battosai.

43:28.690 --> 43:33.069
I haven't seen you in 10 years,
since Toba-Fushimi.

43:38.533 --> 43:39.618
We need to talk.

43:42.537 --> 43:43.580
Come out.

44:15.779 --> 44:18.073
Battosai the Killer?

44:34.881 --> 44:39.010
Where have you been hiding
all these years?

44:40.178 --> 44:41.304
Mr Yamagata!

44:45.558 --> 44:48.937
There were rumours
of a man who could fight

44:49.270 --> 44:52.023
going around helping people.

44:52.232 --> 44:54.693
I had them checked out.

45:00.990 --> 45:02.117
Saito?

45:03.076 --> 45:07.163
We've all gone different ways
since 10 years ago,

45:08.415 --> 45:11.793
but all of us
still hoping for a better land.

45:15.171 --> 45:21.010
Now he calls himself Goro Fujita.
He helps me out.

45:23.972 --> 45:25.557
What would you like?

45:26.349 --> 45:28.351
This is being dealt openly.

45:32.522 --> 45:33.815
"Spiderweb".

45:34.149 --> 45:38.153
It looks like regular opium,
but it's completely different.

45:39.738 --> 45:41.698
It's much more addictive.

45:42.741 --> 45:45.034
Opium will destroy a country.

45:45.243 --> 45:49.914
A land as powerful as China
couldn't control it.

45:51.124 --> 45:55.211
Now part of the country
is an English colony.

45:56.421 --> 46:00.759
I am but a wanderer.
Why do you tell me this?

46:01.176 --> 46:06.765
The people making this stuff
probably have bigger plans.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.321
We need your help.

46:23.490 --> 46:25.408
Join with our army

46:30.413 --> 46:33.583
and put these arms of yours
to good use.

46:33.666 --> 46:36.586
I have no wish to serve as a killer.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.805
A killer?

46:49.057 --> 46:52.435
That was all to restore
the Emperor's authority!

46:54.312 --> 46:55.647
No guts any more?

46:58.191 --> 46:59.818
Is this a sword?

47:04.823 --> 47:07.158
Without killing, who can you protect?

47:10.745 --> 47:15.834
Even with this blade, I can protect
the kind of people I meet now.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.168
Let's see.

47:19.796 --> 47:24.008
All fine words aside,
can you even protect yourself?

47:42.277 --> 47:43.695
Put up your sword.

47:44.112 --> 47:45.154
No!

48:21.608 --> 48:26.362
When a man's own blade faces him,
he suffers.

48:33.828 --> 48:35.330
Like this.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.919
Remember how it felt?

48:45.089 --> 48:50.219
I have abandoned my past.
I will kill no more.

48:57.936 --> 48:59.187
Enough!

49:25.254 --> 49:26.589
My apologies.

49:29.968 --> 49:31.010
Not at all.

49:36.849 --> 49:38.142
Let him go.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.539
Hey, Kaoru!

50:32.447 --> 50:33.489
Kaoru!

50:37.952 --> 50:40.747
Sorry! Are you OK?

50:42.206 --> 50:43.374
Help me!

50:43.499 --> 50:44.667
They're after me!

50:47.170 --> 50:48.254
Please!

50:58.347 --> 50:59.390
Miss Kaoru...

51:19.619 --> 51:21.162
Where will you go?

51:31.589 --> 51:32.840
Come with me.

51:36.469 --> 51:37.720
You saved us.

51:43.351 --> 51:47.105
You know I was a killer...

51:47.230 --> 51:48.481
No, I don't.

51:55.571 --> 51:59.575
The man I met is a wanderer
named Kenshin.

52:02.453 --> 52:05.498
Everyone has things
they don't want to talk about.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.002
Right?

52:13.339 --> 52:14.382
Here.

52:16.425 --> 52:17.468
Take it.

52:22.348 --> 52:23.391
Let's go.

52:30.606 --> 52:31.649
Come on!

52:34.026 --> 52:35.069
Let's go.

52:46.247 --> 52:47.290
Come in.

52:48.166 --> 52:49.876
Thank you.

52:54.255 --> 52:55.298
Yahiko...

52:58.509 --> 53:01.888
Yahiko Myojin.
He trains here, sort of.

53:02.722 --> 53:04.098
He moved in.

53:04.765 --> 53:08.436
I'm just here
cos you need students.

53:08.561 --> 53:11.230
He's rude, but he has potential.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.399
I'm just here to get tough!

53:13.566 --> 53:14.942
Yes, I know.

53:15.067 --> 53:17.195
Kenshin's moving in, too.

53:18.029 --> 53:20.114
That makes me "Elder Brother".

53:22.450 --> 53:23.951
I'm honoured.

53:25.077 --> 53:26.579
Uh... Right!

53:27.455 --> 53:28.748
Hey!

53:29.081 --> 53:31.083
Introduce me, too.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.007
Who are you?

53:38.090 --> 53:40.468
She was wet, so I heated the bath.

53:40.801 --> 53:42.053
Without asking?

53:42.178 --> 53:44.972
And who's that gentleman?

53:49.393 --> 53:50.728
Hey, wait...

53:50.853 --> 53:53.147
Kenshin the Wanderer.

53:56.025 --> 53:59.153
Oh, so you're him?

53:59.987 --> 54:01.489
The boy told me.

54:02.990 --> 54:06.160
Megumi Takani.
Pleased to meet you.

54:07.453 --> 54:09.163
The pleasure's mine.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.105
Here's a change of clothes.

54:35.189 --> 54:36.482
I thank you.

54:39.360 --> 54:44.532
My father was a big man,
so these are from when he was young.

54:45.825 --> 54:46.909
Maybe

54:48.661 --> 54:50.538
they're too gaudy?

54:52.039 --> 54:54.834
No. They will be fine.

55:46.594 --> 55:48.387
<i>The sword brings life...</i>

55:57.730 --> 55:58.856
Come in!

56:03.903 --> 56:05.279
So anyway.

56:06.572 --> 56:08.699
Why are you here?

56:09.742 --> 56:14.080
Oh, dear! She seems to think
I'm in the way.

56:15.623 --> 56:17.625
You're not from around here.

56:17.917 --> 56:20.294
Where do you come from?

56:20.461 --> 56:23.297
Not telling. Mystery becomes a girl.

56:23.923 --> 56:24.965
It's ready.

56:28.094 --> 56:29.136
There.

56:29.220 --> 56:31.180
I thank you.

56:34.767 --> 56:38.104
Eat all you like.
This is to thank you.

56:40.940 --> 56:41.982
Then...

56:47.029 --> 56:48.072
Very good.

56:48.489 --> 56:49.573
You see?

56:49.657 --> 56:50.950
That's hot!

56:51.575 --> 56:52.952
Be careful!

56:53.160 --> 56:54.328
I know!

56:54.870 --> 56:56.038
Kaoru...

56:57.039 --> 56:59.291
I hear you had some trouble.

56:59.625 --> 57:00.668
Tae...

57:01.544 --> 57:02.920
Don't give in.

57:03.712 --> 57:07.508
We've all decided
we're not going to sell.

57:11.512 --> 57:12.805
Welcome!

57:16.934 --> 57:20.521
That's Kanryuu Takeda.
He's a rich businessman.

57:22.523 --> 57:23.566
Washroom?

57:23.899 --> 57:24.942
That way.

57:33.993 --> 57:35.035
Sir!

57:41.000 --> 57:42.835
Excuse me!

57:44.670 --> 57:50.384
Are you the hero who saved
the local dojo from 10 men?

57:54.430 --> 57:58.017
I am a merchant
involved in trade.

58:01.479 --> 58:02.521
Show him.

58:04.398 --> 58:06.108
I'll be blunt.

58:07.735 --> 58:10.321
With this, we wish to hire you.

58:10.404 --> 58:12.198
For the work of 10,

58:12.907 --> 58:15.534
10 times the pay.

58:15.659 --> 58:18.996
How about it?
Will you be a bodyguard?

58:20.247 --> 58:22.041
No, thank you.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.052
This isn't enough?

58:37.014 --> 58:41.143
"The hungry samurai picks his teeth,
pretending he has eaten"...

58:41.310 --> 58:43.062
That's all very well.

58:44.855 --> 58:49.068
But it's money that talks
in this new age.

58:49.527 --> 58:53.239
Pride won't bring you a penny
these days.

58:53.447 --> 58:58.577
It's the ones with that pride
who fall furthest and hardest.

58:58.827 --> 59:01.247
Look at all the brothels.

59:01.372 --> 59:04.583
They're full of samurai wives
and daughters.

59:04.708 --> 59:09.296
Every gang of thieves these days
is all former samurai.

59:12.424 --> 59:15.469
It's time to forget
you were ever a samurai

59:18.722 --> 59:21.267
and learn how to

59:22.726 --> 59:23.936
enjoy life.

59:30.442 --> 59:31.819
That's rude.

59:46.834 --> 59:50.129
Without money,
you don't eat beef.

59:52.047 --> 59:54.091
I'll take the money, then.

59:54.216 --> 59:55.342
Sanosuke!

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:03.851
Hire me.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:06.770
Why you?

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.525
I'm a street fighter.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:14.528
I just got out of jail. I'm broke.

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.323
Are you tough enough

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:20.075
to earn this?

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:25.372
Would the legendary killer
care to try me,

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.833
Battosai?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.180
Hire me if I beat him.

01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:43.932
The establishment will suffer.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.810
Let's go outside.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:54.026
Just what I wanted to hear!
Let's all go outside!

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.903
Fight! Fight!

01:00:57.905 --> 01:00:58.989
This thing

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:02.951
was made to cut down horses.

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:06.038
It's 400 years old.

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:16.590
It hasn't been maintained,
so there's no edge on it.

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:17.925
But...

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.849
It'll still knock a man flat.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.238
Hold it!

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:49.456
Battosai...

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:55.504
Choshu clan assassin
from age 14 to 19,

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.256
one of the "Patriots of Restoration".

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:05.097
But no one's seen him
for the last 10 years.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.823
Move!

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.284
Out of the way!

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:28.203
Move!

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.380
Put up your sword.

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:43.677
Draw yours

01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:45.304
and fight!

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.224
I have no wish to.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:50.976
Why not?

01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:57.524
We have no quarrel.

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:12.164
Would a man like you
serve a man like that?

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:20.380
Well?

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.341
What's wrong?

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.677
Well? What's wrong?

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:28.305
Come on, street fighter!

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:30.182
Flatten him!

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.646
Shut up! Don't tell me how to fight!

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:51.119
Forget it.

01:03:52.788 --> 01:03:54.915
I'll just end up in jail again.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.919
Sorry to bother you!

01:03:59.545 --> 01:04:02.464
Go back inside, everybody.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.593
Show's over!

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:12.766
My apologies.

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:20.357
Let's eat.
We're wasting good beef.

01:04:21.942 --> 01:04:23.777
He's the real thing.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:27.239
Be careful.

01:04:33.579 --> 01:04:38.500
We don't want Battosai angry at us.

01:04:39.835 --> 01:04:40.919
Yes, sir!

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.763
<i>Not enough blood.</i>

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:58.270
<i>It's still not enough blood!</i>

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:02.983
<i>This is my way.</i>

01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:08.739
<i>I am the true
Battosai the Killer!</i>

01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:24.004
Battosai again...

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:30.302
He kills hoodlums and cops...
Whose side is he on?

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.932
Once you kill,
there is no going back.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.186
That is what killing means.

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:46.443
Go on ahead.

01:05:48.904 --> 01:05:49.947
Come on.

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.114
Hey!

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:53.241
I'm coming!

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:04.252
The men who attacked your dojo,
you could have killed them yourself.

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:09.341
If you had,

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:13.261
these officers wouldn't have died.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:21.812
That back-blade of yours
is very useful, isn't it?

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:30.779
Move!

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.489
Out of the way!

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:30.714
<i>Will you be an assassin
for the cause of the new age?</i>

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:35.844
Kyoto, 14 years earlier

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:42.059
Only if the lives I take

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:49.733
bring a new age

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.696
of peace.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:02.079
Can you believe a guy getting married
in these crazy times?

01:08:03.205 --> 01:08:04.289
Sorry!

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:06.249
Aw, why not?

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.335
He's a happy guy.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:10.378
I'm jealous!

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.600
Who goes there? State your name!

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:28.145
You're Battosai?

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:41.368
You Choshu rebel!

01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:44.912
Die!

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.600
I don't want to die!

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:14.984
I can't die now! I can't!

01:09:20.115 --> 01:09:25.828
There's someone I care for.
I can't die now!

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:43.138
I can't die now!

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:46.474
There's someone I love!

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.884
I can't die!

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:24.012
I can't die!

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.189
I can't die!

01:10:36.358 --> 01:10:38.735
I can't die now!

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:37.419
Justification for Execution

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.518
<i>How do I serve the new age</i>

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.980
<i>by killing those who are its future?</i>

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:29.864
Am I doing right?

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:37.038
<i>You're a murderer.</i>

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:11.239
Kenshin!

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:15.410
Miss Kaoru?

01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:21.666
You hadn't come back.
I was worried

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:28.590
that maybe you'd gone away.

01:14:37.015 --> 01:14:38.766
I'm hungry.

01:15:23.478 --> 01:15:25.313
Magnificent!

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:31.194
I don't believe this thing!

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.029
And the plan?

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.198
Everything's ready.

01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:44.165
We'll build a dock at that dojo
and ship opium... To where?

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.668
All over Japan.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:49.754
No!

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.509
The world!

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:00.515
With the money we take
from the beasts it creates,

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.309
we buy guns!

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:10.233
The Kanryuu Empire!

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:21.828
I will rule this new age!

01:16:51.733 --> 01:16:53.359
It begins.

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.741
Awaken, Battosai.

01:17:51.918 --> 01:17:52.960
Megumi...

01:17:55.546 --> 01:17:57.173
So here you are.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:07.183
You're mixed up with opium,
and that's a fact.

01:18:09.644 --> 01:18:12.522
You're stuck with us,

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.274
or with opium, at least.

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.991
You're one of us, so I'll warn you.

01:18:27.078 --> 01:18:28.121
Watch out.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:02.697
Megumi's rice...

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.659
Kenshin's soup...

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:08.077
And fish...

01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:12.707
Kaoru fried the fish.

01:19:17.128 --> 01:19:22.049
If you want to get married,
you'd better learn how to cook.

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:26.721
You'll lose him.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.556
Quiet!

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:31.893
You know what?

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.687
I need some new students.

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:38.733
This kid's making me rusty.

01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:40.401
Look who's talking!

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.445
Calm down, both of you.

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:44.280
Let's eat.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.909
Kaoru!

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:50.620
Is anyone here?

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:51.788
Kaoru!

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:53.372
Help us!

01:19:56.083 --> 01:20:02.507
She went numb and started gasping.
We tried to find a doctor...

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:03.716
And?

01:20:04.342 --> 01:20:09.388
Every doctor around here
vanished two days ago!

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:18.105
We're at our wits' end!

01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:37.166
Watch out.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:44.131
That dojo will be mine.

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:51.430
Kaoru! Kaoru!

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:52.890
Help!

01:20:52.974 --> 01:20:54.100
Kaoru!

01:20:54.809 --> 01:20:56.936
- Help!
- What's wrong?

01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:02.024
You!

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.116
Go inside!

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:11.492
In here?

01:21:14.829 --> 01:21:15.913
What's going on?

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.126
Plague?

01:21:22.128 --> 01:21:24.714
Somebody get a doctor!

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.883
Right here.

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.516
Fever, lethargy...

01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:40.187
Rat poison?

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:43.190
Are you sure?

01:21:43.608 --> 01:21:46.027
They need to vomit.
Bring water.

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:49.488
But not from the wells.
They might be poisoned.

01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:55.870
Go buy some castor oil.
Get towels and kettles.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.121
You!

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:59.874
Buy all the water you can.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:03.002
Is there a healer in the next village?

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:05.254
Yes.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.048
I'll write a list.

01:22:10.718 --> 01:22:13.137
We have to move fast!

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.431
Yes, ma'am!

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.237
Here's water!

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:37.805
He'll pay for this.
These are people's lives!

01:23:46.272 --> 01:23:47.398
Miss Megumi,

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:52.153
isn't it time
you told us who you were?

01:23:57.575 --> 01:23:59.368
<i>Her name's "Takani"?</i>

01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:01.495
Megumi?

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:03.080
You know her?

01:24:03.164 --> 01:24:06.667
There's nobody in medicine
who doesn't know

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:09.253
the Takani family.

01:24:12.006 --> 01:24:16.844
They're famous doctors.
They have been for generations.

01:24:18.179 --> 01:24:22.933
But they were on the wrong side
in the Boshin War.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:25.436
It's said they were all killed.

01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:31.358
But it looks like maybe
a daughter survived.

01:24:41.452 --> 01:24:44.663
You were an assassin, right?

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:56.008
Shouldn't you tell me about yourself
before you make demands of me?

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:09.146
I'll bet

01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:14.485
those hands have killed many.

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:20.741
And those scars?

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:23.911
Battle scars?

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:27.540
Like a medal?

01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:38.092
This scar

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:45.432
came from a young samurai.

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:54.108
And this one

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:02.116
came from the woman
he was to marry.

01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:15.963
I have killed more men
than I can...

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:17.798
I've never killed.

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:24.597
But I had no parents or family
to depend on.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.146
Kanryuu took me in.

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:38.569
I was his woman.

01:26:49.747 --> 01:26:51.957
We used each other.

01:26:57.671 --> 01:27:01.675
He used me to make opium,
and I used him

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.183
to stay alive.

01:27:15.022 --> 01:27:16.482
To stay alive.

01:27:31.622 --> 01:27:32.665
Opium!

01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:36.710
No!

01:27:37.503 --> 01:27:38.545
Shut up!

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.047
Keep quiet!

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.831
Kanryuu's got about 250 men.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:00.294
Some are samurai, good fighters,

01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:03.047
cut adrift by the new age.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:09.845
I'm coming.

01:29:17.061 --> 01:29:18.103
Kenshin!

01:29:20.606 --> 01:29:21.648
Look!

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:23.776
Megumi's gone!

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:32.034
Oh, no...

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:05.275
I'll come, too.

01:30:07.528 --> 01:30:08.987
You stay here.

01:30:12.366 --> 01:30:15.202
Your school cannot afford to lose you.

01:30:15.536 --> 01:30:16.578
But...

01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:19.164
This'll take us all night.

01:30:20.457 --> 01:30:23.669
Have breakfast for five,
and the bathwater hot.

01:30:24.128 --> 01:30:25.212
I'm coming!

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:27.131
Hold it!

01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:32.845
You'll just be in the way.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.721
- Shut up!
- Yahiko...

01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:41.687
Stay here.

01:30:47.443 --> 01:30:49.403
Guard Miss Kaoru.

01:31:38.327 --> 01:31:39.912
I knew

01:31:41.455 --> 01:31:43.373
you'd be back.

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:51.048
This is the only place you have
to come back to.

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:54.801
Tomorrow you get to work.

01:31:54.885 --> 01:31:56.720
I didn't come back

01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.642
to make opium.

01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:06.146
I'm here to kill you.

01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:12.611
Don't worry.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:15.113
We're stuck with each other.

01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:18.450
I'll kill myself, too.

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:20.327
Don't just stand there!

01:32:20.661 --> 01:32:21.912
Don't be stupid.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.580
Thus I atone!

01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:31.797
You bitch!

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:34.633
After I treated you so nice!

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:52.526
He's here.

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.287
That man.

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.049
Kanryuu!

01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:24.141
Hey!

01:33:25.559 --> 01:33:28.979
Get out here
and we'll kick some butt!

01:34:30.082 --> 01:34:31.541
Battosai!

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:35.337
It's her!

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:41.802
It's bad manners to come barging
onto someone's property.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:43.553
Oh, yeah?

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:45.430
Don't hold back!

01:34:46.515 --> 01:34:47.557
Kill them!

01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:51.561
Go on!

01:35:00.278 --> 01:35:01.321
Kill!

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.990
Here's money!

01:35:06.451 --> 01:35:09.663
Here's money! Kill them!

01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:12.666
All the money you want!

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:14.835
Do it!

01:35:23.218 --> 01:35:24.302
Kill them!

01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:41.695
I don't get it. Why?

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:47.701
Why is Battosai doing this?
What does he stand to gain?

01:35:47.868 --> 01:35:52.414
If he wanted to gain,
he'd be in the army by now.

01:35:53.081 --> 01:35:56.835
The "Patriots of the Restoration"
are all like that.

01:35:59.796 --> 01:36:01.047
Tell me about it.

01:36:03.842 --> 01:36:06.386
Get that thing ready.

01:36:08.346 --> 01:36:09.806
You mean...

01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:10.932
Just do it!

01:36:11.224 --> 01:36:14.269
In business,
you prepare for the worst!

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:16.021
Yes, sir.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:19.357
Take the woman away.

01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:54.059
Do something for me.

01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:48.154
Where's four-eyes?

01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:49.447
Upstairs.

01:37:58.206 --> 01:37:59.666
So who fights me?

01:38:11.553 --> 01:38:12.679
I Will.

01:38:25.191 --> 01:38:29.029
Bare fists.
Time for a street fighter.

01:38:29.154 --> 01:38:30.196
Get going.

01:38:30.697 --> 01:38:31.823
I thank you.

01:38:48.006 --> 01:38:50.008
So you're Battosai?

01:38:54.512 --> 01:38:55.972
Where's Miss Megumi?

01:38:57.223 --> 01:39:00.477
Is that woman worth saving?

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.813
No one is not worth saving.

01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:06.066
Fine words.

01:39:07.192 --> 01:39:11.404
And why have you
sold your soul to Kanryuu?

01:39:14.074 --> 01:39:15.116
My Soul?

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:18.703
I took you all
for finer men than that.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:25.543
Don't be stupid.

01:39:43.812 --> 01:39:45.188
I was starving

01:39:47.273 --> 01:39:50.443
in this insipid new age of yours.

01:40:27.397 --> 01:40:29.107
Hey! Hey!

01:40:31.317 --> 01:40:32.944
Kenshin! Are you OK?

01:40:54.132 --> 01:40:55.175
Die.

01:41:24.871 --> 01:41:26.456
What's with that sword?

01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:34.923
It's my pledge

01:41:36.549 --> 01:41:37.675
not to kill.

01:41:51.564 --> 01:41:52.690
Not so fast!

01:42:16.339 --> 01:42:18.967
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:42:20.802 --> 01:42:21.886
What for?

01:42:30.395 --> 01:42:31.729
Want some?

01:42:32.355 --> 01:42:33.398
Here.

01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:35.400
Chicken?

01:42:38.403 --> 01:42:41.364
The poor bird! I'm a vegetarian.

01:42:45.118 --> 01:42:46.161
Wine?

01:42:47.078 --> 01:42:48.121
Sure.

01:43:24.824 --> 01:43:29.746
With all the men you've killed,
you insult me with that blade?

01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:09.118
To fight with fists,

01:44:09.827 --> 01:44:12.121
you need to use your head!

01:44:21.172 --> 01:44:22.382
It's been fun.

01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:56.207
Now you're ready to fight, huh?

01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:21.733
You've pledged not to kill?

01:45:23.359 --> 01:45:25.987
Can you end this without killing?

01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:28.323
Yes, I can.

01:45:28.531 --> 01:45:29.574
Then try!

01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:13.409
What a party!

01:46:16.454 --> 01:46:17.747
Let's go.

01:46:19.624 --> 01:46:20.666
Wait!

01:46:23.419 --> 01:46:25.296
It's not over yet.

01:46:27.048 --> 01:46:28.132
Fight!

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:32.220
Yes, it is.

01:47:07.463 --> 01:47:08.714
I love this!

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.882
Cigar.

01:47:13.511 --> 01:47:14.554
Light.

01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:16.514
Sanosuke!

01:47:23.479 --> 01:47:26.190
At least let me have a smoke!

01:47:28.276 --> 01:47:31.362
You wrecked my house!

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:33.197
You wrecked it!

01:47:33.322 --> 01:47:37.118
Where's the great Battosai?
I'll show him!

01:47:38.494 --> 01:47:40.204
I'll help you kill him.

01:47:41.456 --> 01:47:43.166
How did you get here?

01:47:43.708 --> 01:47:46.377
That kid came to the police.

01:47:47.128 --> 01:47:48.171
Yahiko?

01:47:51.257 --> 01:47:52.300
Well?

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:53.593
Look.

01:47:54.177 --> 01:47:56.512
What's the matter?

01:47:56.596 --> 01:48:01.767
He can only aim that thing
one way at a time.

01:48:02.685 --> 01:48:06.814
Come one and all!
Make yourself at home!

01:48:07.815 --> 01:48:08.858
What's wrong?

01:48:09.650 --> 01:48:10.693
I give!

01:48:11.777 --> 01:48:13.321
<i>I</i> give up.

01:48:13.446 --> 01:48:15.698
Whoa! Don't shoot!

01:48:17.617 --> 01:48:19.702
We can't fight that thing.

01:48:20.536 --> 01:48:21.704
Right, Kenshin?

01:48:22.914 --> 01:48:25.791
Come on out. We can't win.

01:48:33.216 --> 01:48:34.550
I surrender.

01:48:42.975 --> 01:48:44.560
Put your sword down.

01:49:06.165 --> 01:49:10.586
Apologise to me.
From down on your knees.

01:49:12.171 --> 01:49:15.716
Take your clothes off.
All of them!

01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:18.928
Take off your clothes
and kowtow to me!

01:49:22.598 --> 01:49:23.641
Yeah, sure!

01:49:26.936 --> 01:49:28.312
Damn you!

01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:37.780
Over here! Shoot! Shoot!

01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:41.242
More! More!

01:50:16.819 --> 01:50:19.655
Do you know
what money can't buy?

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:32.710
What you're begging for now.

01:50:41.010 --> 01:50:42.053
Life.

01:50:45.765 --> 01:50:46.849
No!

01:50:53.564 --> 01:50:57.068
At last I get to send you flying.

01:51:00.237 --> 01:51:01.322
What?

01:51:01.656 --> 01:51:03.824
I'll take it from here.
Get going.

01:51:07.828 --> 01:51:08.913
I thank you.

01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:27.431
Miss Megumi!

01:51:30.476 --> 01:51:31.936
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:51:32.311 --> 01:51:33.354
You're fine now.

01:51:34.522 --> 01:51:35.940
I'm glad you're safe.

01:51:39.110 --> 01:51:40.945
He's got Kaoru!

01:52:07.179 --> 01:52:08.806
So you're awake?

01:52:16.397 --> 01:52:18.357
Don't look at me like that.

01:52:19.692 --> 01:52:22.820
By taking you hostage,
I enrage Battosai.

01:52:23.904 --> 01:52:28.325
That anger will make him
the killer he once was.

01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:41.380
He should be here soon.

01:52:54.852 --> 01:52:55.895
Kenshin!

01:53:11.202 --> 01:53:12.578
You're angry.

01:53:14.205 --> 01:53:16.874
At you, for involving her,

01:53:18.876 --> 01:53:22.213
and at myself for letting you.

01:53:23.881 --> 01:53:24.965
Kenshin?

01:53:32.890 --> 01:53:34.892
That's right, Battosai.

01:53:36.143 --> 01:53:37.895
Get mad!

01:53:40.064 --> 01:53:41.232
Miss Kaoru!

01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:09.927
Can you kill me with that?

01:54:44.295 --> 01:54:45.379
Kenshin!

01:54:47.798 --> 01:54:49.967
You didn't expect the back turn?

01:55:18.996 --> 01:55:19.997
Kenshin!

01:55:25.169 --> 01:55:26.837
Not yet, huh?

01:55:31.342 --> 01:55:35.679
You're still a long way from
the Battosai you once were.

01:55:49.068 --> 01:55:50.110
Miss Kaoru!

01:55:50.194 --> 01:55:55.699
My "one side of the soul" technique.
Strong enough to paralyse the lungs.

01:56:00.913 --> 01:56:02.706
She's got two minutes.

01:56:10.047 --> 01:56:11.090
Jine!

01:56:12.091 --> 01:56:16.387
You don't have much time.
Let your sword speak for you.

01:56:24.436 --> 01:56:25.729
Nicely done.

01:56:27.648 --> 01:56:29.400
If you value your life,

01:56:30.317 --> 01:56:32.736
lift the spell on her!

01:56:33.112 --> 01:56:35.072
I can't break it.

01:56:36.615 --> 01:56:39.076
There are only two ways.

01:56:39.576 --> 01:56:44.623
She does it herself,
or you kill me

01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:48.752
and end my sword-spirit.

01:56:52.673 --> 01:56:53.757
Then...

01:57:45.851 --> 01:57:46.977
To the death,

01:57:47.978 --> 01:57:49.980
Battosai!

01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:09.333
The game is over.

01:58:16.507 --> 01:58:18.675
I'm going to kill you.

01:59:27.077 --> 01:59:29.788
The Battosai "pure draw" stance.

01:59:56.481 --> 02:00:00.819
"High Heaven" style,
twin-dragon strike.

02:00:03.614 --> 02:00:06.033
Elbow shattered,
tendons snapped.

02:00:07.117 --> 02:00:09.453
You can never duel again.

02:00:13.874 --> 02:00:14.958
And now...

02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:20.297
I end your life.

02:00:28.972 --> 02:00:30.849
For Miss Kaoru,

02:00:34.394 --> 02:00:36.647
I will kill one more time.

02:00:40.067 --> 02:00:41.526
Kill me.

02:00:42.319 --> 02:00:43.362
Die!

02:00:44.696 --> 02:00:46.156
Kenshin, no!

02:00:58.543 --> 02:01:00.170
She broke it.

02:01:02.506 --> 02:01:03.507
Miss Kaoru!

02:01:06.009 --> 02:01:09.513
Don't go back to killing!

02:01:13.433 --> 02:01:15.686
Killing is wrong!

02:01:20.357 --> 02:01:24.528
You mustn't kill, Kenshin!

02:01:29.074 --> 02:01:30.200
For the sake

02:01:34.705 --> 02:01:36.915
of those you've already killed!

02:01:41.795 --> 02:01:42.921
And for

02:01:46.425 --> 02:01:48.051
all the people

02:01:49.636 --> 02:01:51.555
you've saved!

02:01:56.935 --> 02:01:58.729
You don't have to kill

02:02:03.233 --> 02:02:06.236
to be of help to someone.

02:02:08.572 --> 02:02:09.573
And...

02:02:14.578 --> 02:02:15.579
That's...

02:02:19.916 --> 02:02:25.589
The new age you fought for!

02:02:41.772 --> 02:02:42.939
Miss Kaoru.

02:02:48.528 --> 02:02:54.117
I'm going to finish this, Battosai.

02:02:59.373 --> 02:03:00.624
Enough.

02:03:01.792 --> 02:03:04.628
With one arm,
you have no chance.

02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:10.300
This isn't over yet.

02:03:21.853 --> 02:03:24.564
At heart, you're a killer.

02:03:25.524 --> 02:03:28.485
I'm a killer too, so I know.

02:03:31.154 --> 02:03:33.824
Once a killer, always a killer.

02:03:36.076 --> 02:03:39.913
I'll watch from Hell as you rave

02:03:41.081 --> 02:03:43.834
about being a "wanderer".

02:04:42.726 --> 02:04:43.727
You see?

02:04:45.395 --> 02:04:51.234
Look what happens if you stop killing
and take up that sham called justice.

02:04:56.072 --> 02:04:58.909
Killing gives birth to hatred.

02:05:00.744 --> 02:05:02.746
And hatred kills in its turn.

02:05:04.956 --> 02:05:11.755
To break that chain,
I carry a sword that will not kill.

02:05:16.927 --> 02:05:19.137
When will you ever learn?

02:05:31.858 --> 02:05:33.276
So you're leaving?

02:05:37.113 --> 02:05:39.282
Wandering is the easy way out.

02:05:46.373 --> 02:05:48.291
Our only choice is

02:05:51.002 --> 02:05:52.963
to live and die by the sword.

02:06:09.646 --> 02:06:11.982
All these smuggled goods!

02:06:13.024 --> 02:06:16.486
Make sure you get everybody!

02:06:24.035 --> 02:06:25.662
Take me to the port.

02:06:26.329 --> 02:06:28.999
Let me get away,
and I'll reward you.

02:06:35.839 --> 02:06:39.676
I've got lots of money.
Right in this pocket here.

02:06:39.843 --> 02:06:42.345
Can I go get my boot?

02:06:42.512 --> 02:06:43.680
It's hard to walk.

02:06:43.763 --> 02:06:46.016
Hey, I'll be back!

02:06:46.224 --> 02:06:47.684
I'll be back!

02:07:53.583 --> 02:07:54.584
Kenshin!

02:07:55.251 --> 02:07:56.586
You're up?

02:07:57.087 --> 02:07:58.088
Kenshin!

02:07:58.630 --> 02:07:59.673
Where is he?

02:07:59.923 --> 02:08:02.258
Uh, he's...

02:08:02.342 --> 02:08:03.843
Oh, no!

02:08:06.596 --> 02:08:08.431
Hey!

02:08:25.115 --> 02:08:26.116
Kenshin!

02:08:26.616 --> 02:08:28.952
You're awake, Miss Kaoru?

02:08:29.285 --> 02:08:31.371
Don't jump to conclusions!

02:08:31.871 --> 02:08:34.958
Kenshin's going to
make dinner tonight.

02:08:35.125 --> 02:08:37.293
I'm starving!

02:09:05.405 --> 02:09:08.324
You're home, Kenshin.

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.665
I'm home.
