00:01.436 --> 00:03.916
<i>Previously on "Resident Alien"...</i>

00:03.916 --> 00:05.918
<i>There are Grey-human hybrids
all over the Earth.</i>

00:05.918 --> 00:08.791
If anybody's up to something,
I'll know it.

00:08.791 --> 00:11.054
I'm going away, Max,
but you're special.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.925
You're the only one
who can identify aliens.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.885
I am the Alien Tracker.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.060
I need to tell you something.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.845
Joseph is a Grey alien.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.109
<i>I'm going to go
on another date with Joseph.</i>

00:22.109 --> 00:23.632
I'll find out
what you need to know, OK?

00:23.632 --> 00:25.677
You and I are gonna
save Earth together.

00:30.595 --> 00:35.165
<i>♪ I believe in the stars</i>

00:35.165 --> 00:38.429
<i>♪ That cover the sky</i>

00:38.429 --> 00:41.519
<i>♪ I believe
in the moon above ♪</i>

00:41.519 --> 00:45.219
Don't wander too far, honey.
It's dark.

00:45.219 --> 00:48.700
<i>♪ I believe God made them</i>

00:48.700 --> 00:54.315
<i>♪ For you and I to dream on</i>

01:48.934 --> 01:50.588
<i>I can't believe
you're friends with an alien.</i>

01:50.588 --> 01:52.329
How many limbs does he have?

01:52.329 --> 01:54.810
Six, with razor-sharp teeth
and a black tongue.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.159
Cool.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.379
And he dips his pie
in oatmeal.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.729
He's a beast.

02:02.557 --> 02:03.993
Get ready.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.300
You're about to meet
a real-life extraterrestrial.

02:08.606 --> 02:11.131
What are you doing here?
I don't want visitors.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.045
- Um...
- And you know that I hate

02:13.045 --> 02:16.092
bike lines in my driveway dirt.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.615
Aliens are always
making jokes.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.530
Come on.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.751
I have a joke for you.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.056
What has three heads

02:24.056 --> 02:25.667
and has to get out of my house
and it's you?

02:25.667 --> 02:27.059
Us?

02:27.059 --> 02:29.279
Oh, you've heard it.

02:29.279 --> 02:32.195
Wait, where is
grumpy headscarf?

02:32.195 --> 02:35.329
- She moved away.
- And left you here?

02:35.329 --> 02:38.419
Oh, that's like cutting off
the head of a chicken

02:38.419 --> 02:41.161
and watching its dumb
little body run into walls.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.466
- I don't need Sahar,

02:42.466 --> 02:44.120
and I'm not by myself.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.600
I started an alien club.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.645
- Hmm.
- This is Mari and Leo.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.386
I have already forgotten
your names.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.909
- Mari.
- Leo.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.824
We came here so you could
turn into an alien

02:52.824 --> 02:54.913
and show them
what you really look like.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.655
<i>This little shit monkey
is bad enough.</i>

02:57.655 --> 03:00.397
<i>I do not want two more idiots
chasing me around.</i>

03:00.397 --> 03:02.617
I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.229
I'm not an alien.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.448
He's a liar.

03:07.448 --> 03:08.536
You're the liar.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.407
Max isn't even his real name.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.496
It's Giuseppe.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.716
It's OK.
My real name is Bishop.

03:14.716 --> 03:15.891
Bishop?

03:15.891 --> 03:17.849
I see why you keep that
to yourself.

03:17.849 --> 03:18.850
You leave me no choice.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.854
<i>I have been looking
for that taser everywhere!</i>

03:22.854 --> 03:25.205
<i>I should have known
this little pecker stole it.</i>

03:25.205 --> 03:27.337
Reveal your true self now, alien.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.860
<i>I want it back.</i>

03:28.860 --> 03:30.688
<i>It heats my coffee in seconds.</i>

03:30.688 --> 03:32.603
<i>But if I take it,
they will think I care</i>

03:32.603 --> 03:35.040
<i>and may believe I am an alien.</i>

03:35.040 --> 03:36.041
<i>I will wait.</i>

03:36.041 --> 03:37.304
<i>It is only a matter of time</i>

03:37.304 --> 03:39.567
<i>before this idiot
zaps himself.</i>

03:42.657 --> 03:45.050
I knew he wasn't an alien.

03:45.050 --> 03:48.184
We should go.

03:54.625 --> 03:58.455
My name is Max,
and I'm the new Alien Tracker.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.370
<i>Humans spend
their entire lives</i>

04:00.370 --> 04:02.111
<i>believing they are special.</i>

04:02.111 --> 04:03.895
<i>Even after they die,
they do everything</i>

04:03.895 --> 04:06.507
<i>in their power
to remain special forever--</i>

04:06.507 --> 04:08.596
<i>tombstones, plaques,</i>

04:08.596 --> 04:11.425
<i>old libraries
with their names on them.</i>

04:11.425 --> 04:13.688
<i>Not long ago,
the smartest minds on Earth</i>

04:13.688 --> 04:15.298
<i>believed the sun
revolved around them.</i>

04:25.830 --> 04:30.748
<i>The truth is, most humans
are not special at all.</i>

04:30.748 --> 04:34.665
Ah.

04:40.236 --> 04:43.674
<i>Hello, asshole.
You are not special either.</i>

04:43.674 --> 04:46.590
<i>I have Asta on my side,
and together we will find out</i>

04:46.590 --> 04:48.070
<i>why you are here.</i>

04:49.593 --> 04:52.335
Littering is a $50 fine.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.728
I know that.

04:53.728 --> 04:57.166
I'm... putting it in my truck.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.650
Oh!

05:02.650 --> 05:04.826
It's not littering
if it's liquid.

05:09.396 --> 05:12.224
<i>Now I need to get
another coffee.</i>

05:12.224 --> 05:13.878
Joseph is a Grey alien.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.532
You can't go
on another date with him.

05:15.532 --> 05:16.968
It's not a date.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.622
I just have to sit
across from the guy at dinner

05:18.622 --> 05:20.058
and keep him interested
in staying.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.234
That sounds like every date
I've ever been on.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.802
Just long enough for Harry
to search his apartment.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.762
But do you really trust
Harry's plan?

05:27.762 --> 05:31.026
What was his last plan again,
to destroy the Earth?

05:31.026 --> 05:32.157
How'd that work out?

05:32.157 --> 05:33.855
Uh, everything's still here.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.988
D'arcy, I promise, you don't
have to worry about me, OK?

05:36.988 --> 05:38.381
I'll be fine.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.904
OK, great, yeah.

05:39.904 --> 05:43.517
I--I know you'll be fine
because I'm coming with.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.301
I'm gonna be at the counter
as backup.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.650
No. No way.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.522
Joseph will recognize you, OK?

05:48.522 --> 05:49.784
And then he'll be suspicious.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.482
Look, I didn't even tell
my dad.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.179
What if it gets dangerous?

05:54.179 --> 05:56.617
Do you remember when you beat
Laura Roberts at double Dutch

05:56.617 --> 05:59.054
and she shoved your head
into the sand like an ostrich?

05:59.054 --> 06:01.709
Not really.

06:01.709 --> 06:02.797
Maybe.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.146
That was third grade,
though, OK?

06:04.146 --> 06:05.277
I can take care of myself.

06:05.277 --> 06:08.498
Asta, do you prefer

06:08.498 --> 06:12.110
a confetti cake
or a red velvet cake?

06:12.110 --> 06:16.158
I think pie, because if you are
unable to finish it,

06:16.158 --> 06:17.420
I'll eat it.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.031
I'm gonna regret asking,
but why?

06:20.031 --> 06:22.817
Oh, there is a beautiful
ritual on my planet

06:22.817 --> 06:26.734
that whenever we send off
a volunteer

06:26.734 --> 06:29.693
on a suicide mission,

06:29.693 --> 06:33.305
we prepare for them
a last meal.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.611
You're not going.

06:34.611 --> 06:35.960
Bye, Harry.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.006
I'll put pie.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.053
I'm gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be so good.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.533
No, you--

06:43.533 --> 06:45.100
You know, you can trust me.
I love you.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.540
Houses in this neighborhood
are very desirable.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.585
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.325
- Oh, that's great.
- Oh, yeah.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.457
I know my stuff.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.459
Hey. What's going on?

06:56.459 --> 06:58.330
Well, I ran into Judy,
and I mentioned

06:58.330 --> 06:59.767
that we were putting the house
on the market.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.943
And it turns out
that she's a realtor.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.249
Well, not--
not fully, not yet.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.208
I just--
I keep failing the test.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.645
But until I pass,
my Aunt Barbara lets me

07:08.645 --> 07:11.474
work with the clients
that she doesn't care about.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.476
- Oh.
- Wow.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.697
So you're--you're really
serious about this?

07:16.697 --> 07:18.350
Yes, I told you.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.657
And Judy's got
some really good ideas.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.833
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.966
A-right, this way, folks.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.403
How do you guys feel
about animal print?

07:27.403 --> 07:28.709
Zebra?

07:28.709 --> 07:30.188
I mean, obviously,
these couches are hideous.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.495
No on that.
All this trim is just ugh.

07:32.495 --> 07:33.888
Obviously,
you're gonna want to get rid

07:33.888 --> 07:35.106
of the dead meat smell and--

07:35.106 --> 07:36.412
are these real?

07:36.412 --> 07:38.283
No. That's a good thing.
It's a teardown, really.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.764
But we'll sell it, and then
they'll realize it later.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.940
Do you guys have any signs
with cursive on them?

07:42.940 --> 07:45.377
Like--like--like,
"Let's go jump in the lake,"

07:45.377 --> 07:47.118
you know,
or, like, "Great fun."

07:47.118 --> 07:49.033
Light, light, light. You know?

07:49.033 --> 07:51.035
Just open it up,
get rid of that,

07:51.035 --> 07:52.210
blow all this out, you know?

07:52.210 --> 07:53.690
Make it one big kitchen.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.910
Ooh!
A pizza oven right here.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.520
Popcorn machine's
actually better.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.826
It draws the eye.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.306
You're gonna want
to draw the eye.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.047
- Mm-hmm. Not those.
- Yeah.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.746
You know, I'm just not sure

08:05.746 --> 08:07.356
that it's the right time
to sell.

08:07.356 --> 08:10.098
You know, the market and all.
- Oh, no. No, no.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.882
The market's always strong
for a murder house.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.580
- Mm.
- I'm sorry?

08:13.580 --> 08:14.668
Oh, well, OK.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.844
Yeah, technically,
murder-suicide.

08:16.844 --> 08:20.151
I don't know about "murder."

08:20.151 --> 08:21.805
I mean, didn't the--
didn't the previous owner

08:21.805 --> 08:23.764
just kind of slip and fall?

08:23.764 --> 08:24.939
Yeah, she did.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.506
She got shot in the gut,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.246
slipped and fell
in her own blood,

08:28.246 --> 08:30.727
and then she got two more
to the back execution style.

08:30.727 --> 08:31.728
Blam!

08:31.728 --> 08:33.034
What?

08:33.034 --> 08:34.339
Blam!

08:34.339 --> 08:36.472
Ben, don't you remember?
- Hmm?

08:36.472 --> 08:38.561
You wrote a story about it
in first grade.

08:38.561 --> 08:41.564
You drew all the pictures,
used up all the red crayons.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.610
Mm, not ringing a bell.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.872
Who got shot?

08:44.872 --> 08:46.438
Some of the brown crayons
too, remember,

08:46.438 --> 08:47.831
because the lady
shit her pants.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.877
OK, Max, can you upstairs?

08:49.877 --> 08:52.706
I miss all the good stories.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.272
You know, I--I just think

08:54.272 --> 08:56.057
that we should at least
maybe talk about it.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.712
Yeah, we did, just now.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.279
I can't live here.
OK.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.803
- So I'll do the listing?
- Yes.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.413
And you guys get started
on the renovating.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.023
Oh, you know what, though?

09:06.023 --> 09:07.547
I wouldn't pull up
the floorboards,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.592
definitely not the ones
in the basement.

09:09.592 --> 09:12.987
Unless you guys like skeletons,
which some people do.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.250
We can list it on Halloween.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.469
Boo!

09:17.469 --> 09:19.036
Come on.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.651
Maybe we could just
burn the house down

09:24.651 --> 09:25.739
with me inside it.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.398
I smell baked goods.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.576
Yeah, the banana bread is
for Esther at the lab

09:36.576 --> 09:39.317
to expedite the prints we got
from Peter Bach's van,

09:39.317 --> 09:41.406
and the chocolate chip cookies

09:41.406 --> 09:43.321
are for Maureen
at the post office

09:43.321 --> 09:45.672
to hurry the prints
to Esther at the lab.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.500
And the blueberry muffins?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.937
For Ben.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.460
He likes them.

09:53.723 --> 09:57.292
And for you.
- Yes!

09:57.292 --> 09:59.163
My grandmother's
secret recipe.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.991
The day I took it
from her drawer,

10:00.991 --> 10:02.427
she threw a toaster at my head.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.168
She was tough, but she was also

10:04.168 --> 10:06.301
why I went undefeated
in dodgeball.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.955
There's six blueberries
in one half

10:07.955 --> 10:09.260
and two blueberries
in the other.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.567
Was your oven on its side?

10:11.567 --> 10:14.614
No thank you.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.181
Also,
Detective Torres called here

10:17.181 --> 10:18.356
twice already looking for you.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.837
Let--let's just
get to work, OK?

10:20.837 --> 10:23.013
Oh, no.
You're not talking.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.014
Are you ghosting her?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.537
Ghosts talk, Deputy.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.191
That's one of the main things
ghosts do.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.453
If somebody has
something to say

10:28.453 --> 10:29.803
and then they die
before they say it,

10:29.803 --> 10:31.152
they turn ghost.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.719
They write
on fogged-up mirrors.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.242
They whisper in your ear before
you fall asleep at night.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.287
They turn bathwater into blood.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.680
OK? That's communicating.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.160
OK.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.684
Is there something you're not
communicating to Lena?

10:44.905 --> 10:47.864
Get this, right--she planned
a trip for us next month,

10:47.864 --> 10:50.127
all expenses paid by her.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.651
First she's paying for dinners.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.261
Now she's paying
for entire weekends.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.697
What's next?
She gonna give me her kidney?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.133
Oh, not this again.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.526
You're right, not this.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.528
Because this conversation,
it's over.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.356
I'm bringing Ben his muffins
and I'm taking

11:01.356 --> 11:02.574
one of Esther's cookies.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.402
Oh, the cookies
are for Maureen.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.883
Esther is the banana bread.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.363
I don't care.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.626
At least the chocolate chips
are evenly spaced.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.199
Here, Deputy Liv made you
some lopsided muffins.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.201
Oh, I love these.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.159
What's this?

11:22.159 --> 11:23.378
You getting a pool?

11:23.378 --> 11:25.423
Uh, I don't know.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.121
Kate wants to sell the house.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.732
I thought maybe if I put in
a pool, she'd want to stay.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.342
You can count me out.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.257
I don't swim in water
somebody else is tea-bagging.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.998
I'm pretty sure
we'd be wearing bathing suits.

11:34.998 --> 11:36.870
Shit, water don't care.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.089
You wrap a tea bag in a Speedo
and you put it in some water,

11:39.089 --> 11:40.090
you still gonna get
a cup of tea

11:40.090 --> 11:41.744
that tastes like your nuts.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.747
For that, and other reasons,
it's not an option.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.618
I can't afford it.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.752
Really?

11:49.752 --> 11:52.276
Hmm.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.235
Take off your shoe and sock.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.627
- What?
- You heard me.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.151
Go on and make your foot naked.
Let's see it.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.414
I'm gonna say no.

11:59.414 --> 12:03.940
Uh--possible HR violation.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.899
Yeah, that is a pretty foot.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.901
You got yourself
a dancer's arch.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.730
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.296
You know what?

12:12.296 --> 12:14.124
I got the answer
to your problems.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.170
You come see me after work.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.606
Bring your feet.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.271
<i>My people should not
have given up</i>

12:30.271 --> 12:33.578
<i>the Earth to the Greys.</i>

12:33.578 --> 12:35.842
<i>They are ruthless,
but we have beaten them</i>

12:35.842 --> 12:38.322
<i>every time we have faced
each other.</i>

12:40.672 --> 12:42.500
<i>I do not need the help
of my people</i>

12:42.500 --> 12:44.676
<i>to defeat
a single Grey hybrid.</i>

12:44.676 --> 12:46.722
<i>I will be very happy
doing it by my--</i>

12:46.722 --> 12:48.811
- All right.

12:48.811 --> 12:52.597
Let's do this.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.042
I know this building.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.739
I applied
for an apartment here,

13:03.739 --> 13:05.349
but I got turned down.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.916
A Grey alien got in?

13:06.916 --> 13:08.744
This is bullshit.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.312
You stay here.
You will be the lookout.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.704
No way.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.054
All these units are
newly renovated.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.795
I gotta see which one he got.
- Hmm.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.970
He probably has
a steam shower

13:16.970 --> 13:18.841
I need to take a shit into.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.018
OK.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.241
Holy shit. Can you fly?

13:27.241 --> 13:30.897
If I could fly,
why would I climb?

13:30.897 --> 13:34.465
I mean, seriously.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.380
Well, I can't do either.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.912
Grab the rope and pull me up.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.478
Oh, no, I missed.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.570
Pull me up or I'll put
a sign in the bar

13:52.570 --> 13:55.486
that says
Harry Vanderspeigle kicks dogs.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.445
I do not.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.055
Who tells these lies?

13:59.055 --> 14:01.231
Me, you idiot.
I just made it up.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.233
- Oh.
- And people will believe me

14:03.233 --> 14:05.670
because you have
a dog-kicking face.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.889
I do not.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.891
Pull me up
or I'll make up worse.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.373
I do not have
a dog-kicking face.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.635
Throw it.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.425
<i>♪ I'm like a bandit</i>

14:21.425 --> 14:24.994
<i>♪ I steal kisses of hers</i>

14:24.994 --> 14:26.604
<i>♪ Late in the midnight hour</i>

14:26.604 --> 14:28.258
Wait. What are you doing?

14:31.348 --> 14:32.610
You're right.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.612
Oh, my favorite.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.353
- I'm sorry.

14:36.353 --> 14:39.879
I'm having trouble looking out
of my dog-kicking face at you.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.750
Best burgers in town.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.883
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.974
Jesus.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.106
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.716
<i>♪ Sock it to me</i>

15:06.514 --> 15:08.429
Hmm.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.434
People really pay money
for this?

15:13.434 --> 15:15.001
Not if you keep moving.
You gotta stay still.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.219
I'm trying to get
the angle right.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.960
I can't. Ow! Cramp.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.483
Cramp, cramp, cramp, cramp.
- Oh, use it. Go with that.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.485
There's a whole section
of the website called Crampus.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.661
Oh, God. No.
Look, it's just too weird.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.228
I know what you're doing.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.230
You're trying
to make it sound dirty.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.405
It's not.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.103
It's not dirty.

15:30.103 --> 15:33.019
Now spread your toes for me.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.847
- No shame in making money.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.632
I mean, the root
of essential living

15:37.632 --> 15:39.982
is financial security, independence.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.462
Hey, a man's gotta
take care of himself

15:41.462 --> 15:44.160
first and foremost,
even if a woman inserts herself

15:44.160 --> 15:45.857
and starts planning trips.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.773
Lena planned an impromptu
vacation for the two of us.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.993
And before you say, "So what,"

15:50.993 --> 15:52.603
that's not the way
it's supposed to be.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.779
I'm supposed to be
the one initiating that.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.172
Says who?

15:56.172 --> 15:57.913
Now, that's very close
to "So what."

15:57.913 --> 15:59.741
Well, you're talking
about roles,

15:59.741 --> 16:02.048
and everyone in a relationship
has a role they play,

16:02.048 --> 16:03.832
and it works--

16:03.832 --> 16:06.400
as long as one of you doesn't
suddenly switch up the roles

16:06.400 --> 16:07.836
after ten years
so you have no idea

16:07.836 --> 16:09.185
what's happening with her.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.361
OK, I feel like
this is no longer about me.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.235
When I was eight,
my teacher had us write down

16:15.235 --> 16:17.715
what we were doing
for summer vacation.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.283
I wrote, "Fear."

16:20.283 --> 16:23.025
That's me.
That's my thing.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.594
Now, suddenly,
Kate's afraid of birds,

16:26.594 --> 16:28.378
and that scares me.

16:28.378 --> 16:31.033
I mean, how am I supposed to be
the one hiding under the bed

16:31.033 --> 16:33.122
when she's already there?

16:33.122 --> 16:35.820
Well, let me lay
a little wisdom on you.

16:35.820 --> 16:39.868
A man's job is to take care
of his woman, full stop.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.305
See, me, I'm old-school, right?

16:42.305 --> 16:43.698
I like holding doors open.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.047
Do I really want a woman

16:45.047 --> 16:46.701
who's gonna lay her jacket
over a puddle

16:46.701 --> 16:48.007
so my pumps don't get wet?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.399
Well, you're not married.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.792
If you don't like her,
break it off.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.055
I do like her, a lot.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.448
I mean,
Lena's an amazing woman.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.102
She's smart.
She's beautiful.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.060
She's got great taste
in tactical knives.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.583
- Sure.
- Independent.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.281
I actually like
her independence.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.978
I think it's kind of sexy.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.676
Is it too much to ask for,
to find an independent woman

17:05.676 --> 17:07.809
who only does what I want?

17:10.638 --> 17:12.379
Wait.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.468
What is this lump in your foot?
What is that?

17:14.468 --> 17:16.513
Oh, it's been there
since I was a kid.

17:16.513 --> 17:17.645
Really?

17:17.645 --> 17:19.081
You might want
to get that looked at.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.691
If that gets any bigger,
that could derail

17:20.691 --> 17:22.911
your foot modeling career
before it starts.

17:22.911 --> 17:26.306
There's no section of
the website called Lump Foot.

17:26.306 --> 17:30.440
Hey, I saw a light...

17:30.440 --> 17:31.963
on.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.795
She don't know art.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.319
Ah, yeah. See?

17:39.319 --> 17:40.624
This is why I wanted a place
in this building--

17:40.624 --> 17:41.973
brand-new appliances?

17:41.973 --> 17:43.149
I'm so pissed.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.628
Would you focus
your tiny brain?

17:44.628 --> 17:47.109
Remember why we are here,
to find evidence

17:47.109 --> 17:49.503
and get little drawings
or notes

17:49.503 --> 17:52.288
or anything
out of the ordinary.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.160
I'll tell you
what's out of the ordinary--

17:54.160 --> 17:56.640
$600 microwave.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.034
I had no idea
aliens were so bougie.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.515
We are not all alike.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.169
That's racist.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.345
You're right.
I apologize.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.825
How is your breed different?

18:07.825 --> 18:09.827
Ooh, can I say "breed"?

18:09.827 --> 18:10.959
All right, I'm still learning.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.569
We are protectors.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.658
The Greys, they--

18:16.878 --> 18:19.359
The Greys, they are just cruel.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.535
They should not even be here.

18:21.535 --> 18:25.321
Their spaghetti bodies
and their meatball heads

18:25.321 --> 18:27.193
only allow them to live
in the Earth's atmosphere

18:27.193 --> 18:29.151
for a short amount of time.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.457
That's why
they created hybrids?

18:30.457 --> 18:31.675
Yes.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.374
We have been here
for thousands of years.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.376
We belong here.
They do not.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.118
See how easy it is
to sound racist?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.903
Mm.

18:41.903 --> 18:42.904
Look at this.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.297
Jack's pot!

18:44.297 --> 18:45.820
That's just a pizza box.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.561
I don't think it's filled
with alien secrets.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.216
Well, maybe it's filled
with pizza.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.826
I'm hungry.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.786
Wait, wait.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.485
What if it's a trap?

18:58.485 --> 19:00.051
Hmm...

19:13.108 --> 19:17.156
That was worth the risk.

19:18.722 --> 19:22.335
I was upset our last date
got interrupted so quickly.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.250
Yeah, me too.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.253
Could have talked for hours.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.776
I would have liked that.

19:28.776 --> 19:32.214
We never got a chance
to talk about your mother.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.738
Like I said,
she wasn't around.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.088
I lost my mother
when I was a kid too,

19:37.088 --> 19:39.395
so I can relate.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.919
What an odd coincidence.

19:41.919 --> 19:45.836
Look at us,
just two people with no moms.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.145
Really?

19:50.145 --> 19:51.929
What if it's poisoned?

19:51.929 --> 19:54.280
If it was poisoned,
it would have more flavor.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.891
Anthony must have
the night off.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.589
It needs pepper flakes.

20:01.591 --> 20:05.291
What idiot puts
crushed red pepper over there?

20:06.770 --> 20:08.207
Harry, no!

20:11.819 --> 20:13.647
Ooh!

20:13.647 --> 20:16.171
Oh, no.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.304
The pizza's outside the trap.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.745
Oh, good.
That's done.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.532
We can drop the act now.

20:29.532 --> 20:32.318
I know that you know
that I'm what I am.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.755
Yeah?
And what is that?

20:34.755 --> 20:35.799
You know.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.673
Why don't we both say
at the same time

20:39.673 --> 20:42.197
so I know what it is
you think I know?

20:42.197 --> 20:44.112
OK, one, two, three.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.853
Grey alien.
- Asshole.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.029
So both.

20:48.029 --> 20:52.207
You will tell me everything
that you know about Harry.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.948
And why would I do that?

20:53.948 --> 20:56.342
Because I have him trapped.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.219
Stupid cell phone companies.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.917
They shut off my service again
just for not paying my bill.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.310
I am done with them.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.703
It's not the phone.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.836
There is a Reticulan
Photon Net.

21:12.836 --> 21:15.317
And it--it's a pretty
nice one, actually.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.232
OK, well, if your people
are so superior,

21:17.232 --> 21:18.973
why don't you just override it?

21:18.973 --> 21:20.844
This is advanced
alien technology.

21:20.844 --> 21:24.152
You cannot just override it.

21:24.152 --> 21:28.069
You have to construct a thin,
nonconductive plasma deflector

21:28.069 --> 21:30.985
to interfere with the complex
magnetic field.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.682
So there's nothing we can do?

21:32.682 --> 21:34.467
We could unplug it.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.470
The magnetic perimeter
only confines

21:37.470 --> 21:39.646
the molecular structure
for alien life.

21:39.646 --> 21:42.344
Humans can pass right through.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.433
Well, why didn't you
just tell me that?

21:46.435 --> 21:51.397
God, you said
I could walk right through it!

21:51.397 --> 21:53.007
It was 50/50.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.362
<i>♪ I can't help falling</i>

22:00.362 --> 22:01.972
Act normal.

22:01.972 --> 22:05.062
I would hate for something
to happen to your father.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.455
He makes a great hamburger.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.893
Ow.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.330
I said act normal.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.592
That is normal.

22:12.592 --> 22:15.899
I always kick my dates
when they lie to me.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.424
Why don't you make this easy
and tell me

22:18.424 --> 22:20.469
why he is still in Patience?

22:20.469 --> 22:21.949
He hasn't told me shit.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.559
And even if he did,
I wouldn't tell you.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.039
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.432
Neither of you are in
a position to be making rules.

22:26.432 --> 22:29.086
Oh, stop the bullshit.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.479
I know you can't kill him

22:30.479 --> 22:33.003
because it's against
the Galactic Charter thingy.

22:33.003 --> 22:36.572
So he has been
sharing information.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.923
Well, you got me.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.577
I can't kill Harry.

22:41.577 --> 22:45.189
But your friend is fair game.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.017
See, I thought
it was just gonna be Harry,

22:47.017 --> 22:51.282
but this one is a bonus.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.502
If you hurt her,
I will kill you.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.292
Don't do anything stupid,
or people will die,

23:01.292 --> 23:03.382
understand?

23:03.382 --> 23:04.687
Hey.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.168
Hey, I'm Jay.
- I'm busy, Jay.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.171
OK.

23:13.783 --> 23:14.915
Nice work.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.442
Asta is in trouble.
Who is that guy?

23:20.442 --> 23:22.531
The new deputy.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.446
He's bad.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.795
Just go. I got it.

23:25.795 --> 23:26.970
I'm staying.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.798
Jay, you go.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.496
I got it.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.975
Fine.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.818
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:48.818 --> 23:51.386
Hey, sorry.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.432
I kept meaning
to call you back,

23:53.432 --> 23:57.479
and then the day just
got away from me.

23:57.479 --> 24:01.614
Um...

24:01.614 --> 24:04.181
look.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.967
I've been thinking
a lot about us.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.272
I know that you're not thrilled

24:08.272 --> 24:10.361
about me picking up a check
now and then.

24:10.361 --> 24:13.495
And you're clearly not OK
with me taking you on a trip.

24:14.844 --> 24:18.195
I like you a lot,

24:18.195 --> 24:21.503
and I want you to be happy,
not uncomfortable.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.852
Well, thank you.

24:22.852 --> 24:26.508
I appreciate that.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.163
So I think that we should
just end this right now.

24:32.079 --> 24:35.343
Oh. I see.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.692
Do you?

24:36.692 --> 24:41.523
You are who you are, Mike,
but I am who I am.

24:41.523 --> 24:46.223
And when I care about someone,
I show it.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.443
I'm not gonna change who I am.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.534
I have to set an example
for my son.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.536
No, I--I understand.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.538
I was--I was looking forward
to meeting him.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.585
Well, this is why
you haven't.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.896
Take care, Mike.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.568
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:31.965 --> 25:34.968
So I think we should
sell the house.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.578
You do?

25:36.578 --> 25:38.580
If you do, yes.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.755
Because I don't.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.278
Oh, thank God.

25:41.278 --> 25:42.758
I love this house.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.152
I--I never want to leave.

25:45.152 --> 25:47.415
I don't care
if somebody died in it.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.851
- People die.
- People die.

25:48.851 --> 25:49.983
I want to die here.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.288
I want to die here with you.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.682
I want to, you know,
haunt this place.

25:53.682 --> 25:54.727
You know, chop us up.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.076
Bury us underneath
the floorboards.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.730
- I don't want that.
- No, me neither.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.209
Me neither.

25:59.209 --> 26:00.689
So then what?

26:00.689 --> 26:02.691
I don't know.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.828
I just don't feel right.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.960
And at first, I thought
I didn't feel right here,

26:10.960 --> 26:13.746
but...

26:13.746 --> 26:16.792
now I think it's just me.

26:16.792 --> 26:20.927
You know, like--like a part
of me is missing or something.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.929
Mm.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.757
Maybe you just need

26:24.757 --> 26:26.672
to get out of the house
for a little bit.

26:26.672 --> 26:30.153
You know, we can go somewhere.
A vacation?

26:30.153 --> 26:32.155
I haven't been on a trip
in a while.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.983
Oh, and we have
a long weekend coming up.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.506
We can go somewhere fun.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.639
Oh, my God,
I know the perfect place.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.990
Me too: Yellowstone.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.166
- I was gonna say Paris.
- Oh.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.605
But yeah, Yellowstone.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.520
<i>♪ Another lonely night</i>

26:49.520 --> 26:50.652
Thanks, honey.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.571
Damn it, I told Asta
your plan was stupid.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.442
Now I'm trapped in here,
no way out,

26:58.442 --> 26:59.661
and Asta's stuck at the diner

26:59.661 --> 27:02.229
with some hybrid alien
psychopath.

27:02.229 --> 27:05.580
My plan was stupid.
I am stupid.

27:05.580 --> 27:06.929
I hate myself.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.322
Oh, I didn't say all that.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.454
You should have.
I'm worthless.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.674
I failed in my attempt
to destroy all of humanity,

27:12.674 --> 27:15.372
and now I'm failing
in my attempt to save it.

27:15.372 --> 27:19.594
I am nothing but a big,
stupid, human-shaped failure.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.077
Yeah.

27:24.077 --> 27:27.646
Well, you know,
welcome to the club.

27:29.212 --> 27:32.085
You're a failure too?

27:32.085 --> 27:36.176
Yeah, I'm the biggest failure
in Olympics history, man.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.394
Oh, right.

27:37.394 --> 27:40.528
You had to eradicate
a species.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.878
All I had to do was
ski down a hill.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.184
Couldn't even get that right.

27:44.184 --> 27:46.055
That's right,
and you didn't even make it

27:46.055 --> 27:48.275
down the mountain
because you fell.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.233
- Right.
- Millions of people saw you

27:50.233 --> 27:51.800
fail on television.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.845
It's pretty stupid.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.237
It seems like
it should be easy

27:54.237 --> 27:56.457
'cause skiing's mostly gravity.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.198
Yeah, you know what?
You made your point.

27:58.198 --> 28:00.026
Yes, that we are
both failures.

28:08.556 --> 28:12.603
Um, Harry,
do you think it's possible

28:12.603 --> 28:15.345
this Grey technology is
making us bigger?

28:15.345 --> 28:17.173
- No.
- Cool.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.436
Then this thing is
closing in on us.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.656
Oh, he got the new kind.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.317
You better tell me
what you know.

28:30.317 --> 28:31.666
Time is running out.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.059
OK.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.625
OK, fine.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.498
Harry's real name

28:37.498 --> 28:40.806
is... Mork,

28:40.806 --> 28:46.333
and he is from a planet
called... Ork.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.770
OK, good.

28:48.770 --> 28:52.165
Was that really so hard?

28:52.165 --> 28:54.123
Mork.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.777
I don't know this planet Ork.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.952
Who does he report to?

28:56.952 --> 28:59.085
A very powerful being.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.957
I think his name is Orson.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.437
- Orson?
- Yeah.

29:03.437 --> 29:07.658
Orson.
I think I've heard of him.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.705
Mm-hmm.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.315
You got to do something.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.360
You're an alien.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.970
I just watched you
climb a wall.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.363
Don't you have
any other special powers?

29:16.363 --> 29:17.712
Mm.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.627
Even ET could
levitate toys and shit.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.716
He is so special.

29:21.716 --> 29:24.153
ET could fly a bicycle.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.025
ET had a flashlight
for a finger.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.592
Do you know what it is like
to be constantly compared

29:28.592 --> 29:31.552
to that waddling sex doll?

29:31.552 --> 29:34.816
Look, out of all the aliens
on your planet,

29:34.816 --> 29:37.906
you're the one who was chosen

29:37.906 --> 29:40.343
to come here and kill
everyone on Earth.

29:40.343 --> 29:41.867
They picked you.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.956
That makes you special too.
So think.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.218
But they didn't pick me.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.002
I volunteered
'cause I knew I could do it.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.874
But I couldn't do it.
I failed.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.832
No, you volunteered

29:50.832 --> 29:53.095
because you knew
you could do it.

29:53.095 --> 29:56.055
That makes you special.

29:56.055 --> 29:59.754
Yes, and you volunteered
to do this.

29:59.754 --> 30:02.801
Does that also
make you special?

30:02.801 --> 30:05.847
Yeah, I guess it does.

30:05.847 --> 30:08.328
Maybe we're not failures.

30:08.328 --> 30:11.244
Since I was a kid,
all I cared about, right,

30:11.244 --> 30:13.855
was being the best skier
in the world.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.901
You wanted to kill
everyone in the world.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.685
- Mm-hmm.
- Those are big goals.

30:17.685 --> 30:22.603
And stopping the Greys,
that is no small thing either.

30:22.603 --> 30:25.388
We're not stuck in here
because we're failures.

30:25.388 --> 30:29.610
We're in here because
no one else would even try.

30:29.610 --> 30:33.875
Yes. I'm not a failure.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.746
I am special.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.576
Oh. Oh.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.885
I'm special too, right?

30:43.885 --> 30:46.757
Yes, you are special.

30:46.757 --> 30:49.325
Do I really have
a dog-kicking face?

30:49.325 --> 30:52.720
- No, no, no.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.592
See? I told you.
Alien technology.

30:55.592 --> 30:56.898
Thank God.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.596
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me?

30:59.596 --> 31:03.644
No, I've been tracking you,
because I'm the Alien Tracker.

31:03.644 --> 31:05.124
How did you get
past security?

31:05.124 --> 31:07.822
His fortress is impenetrable.

31:07.822 --> 31:08.867
Door was unlocked.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.911
Son of a bitch.

31:09.911 --> 31:10.999
Who cares?

31:10.999 --> 31:12.871
Max, unplug this thing.

31:15.003 --> 31:18.746
I will, if you tell them
you're an alien.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.008
Then we are both going to die

31:20.008 --> 31:21.575
because I am nothing
but a dumb human.

31:21.575 --> 31:22.706
Ugh!

31:22.706 --> 31:25.013
Max, unplug this,
or when I die,

31:25.013 --> 31:26.885
I will haunt the shit
out of you.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.235
I don't care.
I like ghosts.

31:29.235 --> 31:30.453
I don't.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.107
She's scary
even when she's alive.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.327
He's not an alien.
I knew Max was a liar.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.981
All right,
take it easy, Bishop.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.943
Fine. I am a human.

31:41.943 --> 31:44.424
Obviously.

31:44.424 --> 31:49.298
But the person who lives here
is an alien, obviously.

31:49.298 --> 31:53.128
And the reason that you were
able to track down his lair

31:53.128 --> 31:56.958
is because you, Max,

31:56.958 --> 31:59.352
are the Alien Tracker.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.401
Wow.

32:05.401 --> 32:08.143
Cool.

32:08.143 --> 32:11.799
And this Mindy person,
what's her role in all this?

32:13.453 --> 32:14.976
No, no. Damn it.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.152
What's the Grey word
for screw-up?

32:17.152 --> 32:19.589
Oh, or is it just Joseph?

32:19.589 --> 32:21.069
Well, I still have you.

32:21.069 --> 32:24.638
Just smile like nothing's wrong
and get up.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.248
We're walking out of here.

32:29.773 --> 32:32.515
- Get out. She stays.

32:32.515 --> 32:36.128
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

32:36.128 --> 32:39.435
Oh, no. You're an alien?

32:40.610 --> 32:42.090
You think I give a shit?

32:42.090 --> 32:44.179
You can't swing a dead cat
in this town

32:44.179 --> 32:46.877
without hitting an alien.

32:46.877 --> 32:49.228
Double Dutch that,
Laura Roberts.

32:51.230 --> 32:54.015
Is she the one that dunked
your head in the sand?

32:54.015 --> 32:56.365
What? Uh, I don't know.
Maybe. Can't remember.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.193
- Don't worry, folks.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.890
He had too much to drink.

33:02.806 --> 33:08.551
<i>♪ Here I was
wasting all my time ♪</i>

33:08.551 --> 33:10.858
Hi, sir.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.164
Bad news from the lab.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.601
No hit on the fingerprints.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.430
I really thought
we had something this time.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.955
On the bright side,
Esther loved my banana bread.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.131
It didn't go so well
with Maureen.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.220
Her dog ate
the whole plate of cookies,

33:25.220 --> 33:26.874
had to have her stomach pumped.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.571
But she'll be OK.
- Poor dog.

33:28.571 --> 33:31.226
No, Maureen had to have
her stomach pumped.

33:31.226 --> 33:35.752
Sorry, I--I forgot the part
about her OD'ing on Vicodin.

33:35.752 --> 33:36.927
You OK?

33:36.927 --> 33:38.233
If you must know,

33:38.233 --> 33:42.324
Lena and I have decided
to just be friends.

33:42.324 --> 33:43.804
Oh, no.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.371
I said I'm fine, deputy.

33:45.371 --> 33:49.766
Well, you can't just sit here
by yourself being sad.

33:49.766 --> 33:50.941
Come to dinner.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.074
I'm making John's favorite.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.945
- What are you having?
- Turkey meatloaf.

33:54.945 --> 33:57.774
Hard pass.

33:57.774 --> 34:02.170
<i>♪ Ooh, oh, oh, oh</i>

34:02.170 --> 34:09.003
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

34:15.575 --> 34:17.403
You're funny when you sleep.

34:17.403 --> 34:18.578
This is you.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.542
- You didn't tie me up.
- Oh, I was going to.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.804
But then I thought,

34:27.804 --> 34:29.589
hybrid Greys would be
very strong.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.765
You would break
your restraints,

34:31.765 --> 34:34.811
<i>and then you would have
probably broken my chair.</i>

34:36.857 --> 34:38.902
Then I would have to fight you.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.991
And because I am also strong,

34:40.991 --> 34:43.124
I would throw you
across the room.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.607
<i>And then you would break
my refrigerator.</i>

34:50.305 --> 34:52.220
<i>And the refrigerator repairman</i>

34:52.220 --> 34:54.483
<i>would probably be
overly talkative.</i>

34:54.483 --> 34:57.225
Well, my real passion
is photography.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.662
I've--I got a film camera,

34:59.662 --> 35:02.361
which is drastically better
than digital.

35:02.361 --> 35:05.320
I--I like nature photography.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.148
Do you like nature?

35:07.148 --> 35:08.758
I sometimes go on hikes,

35:08.758 --> 35:11.152
and I shoot the things
that I see.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.154
I like the chipmunks.
They're really cute.

35:13.154 --> 35:16.026
People seem to like the photos
of the chipmunks, you know.

35:16.026 --> 35:19.421
My--my mom really likes
the--the chipmunk photos.

35:20.814 --> 35:23.599
I have an alternate scenario,
if I may.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.166
Go ahead.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.515
We fight.

35:26.515 --> 35:28.691
You're strong,
but I am stronger,

35:28.691 --> 35:31.564
and I throw you
across the room.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.483
<i>And then I step
on your stupid alien head</i>

35:37.483 --> 35:39.876
<i>and I kill you.</i>

35:39.876 --> 35:41.574
<i>Except I bite you!</i>

35:50.844 --> 35:52.846
<i>But the refrigerator repairman</i>

35:52.846 --> 35:54.848
<i>also works
for the glass company.</i>

35:54.848 --> 35:59.679
I've shot at all the national
parks in Colorado--

35:59.679 --> 36:04.074
Mesa Verde. Rocky Mountain.

36:04.074 --> 36:07.817
Of course, Sand Dunes.
Sand Dunes is my favorite.

36:07.817 --> 36:09.428
I only shoot on film.

36:09.428 --> 36:10.777
Did I--did I mention that?

36:10.777 --> 36:13.214
I find
it's drastically better than--

36:13.214 --> 36:14.868
than digital.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.697
I do have to develop
my own film in my darkroom.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.873
But my mom's just upstairs,

36:19.873 --> 36:22.310
so sometimes,
she brings me snacks.

36:22.310 --> 36:26.880
I did go with my mom a few
years ago to--to Four Points.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.448
It's where
the four states touch.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.667
I took a photo of her there.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.452
In every situation,
I just end up

36:33.452 --> 36:35.280
with a lot of sweeping to do

36:35.280 --> 36:38.196
and learn more than I need to
about film photography.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.938
Now, what are the Grey aliens
doing here on Earth?

36:41.938 --> 36:43.897
If I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.551
I would understand
better than you.

36:45.551 --> 36:47.074
You're a hybrid.

36:47.074 --> 36:50.033
You are half-human,
which means you're half-stupid.

36:50.033 --> 36:54.212
I am two halves not stupid.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.649
Yet neither of your halves
knows the Greys' plans,

36:56.649 --> 36:58.041
and my half does.

36:58.041 --> 37:00.305
Not the part about the trees.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.871
It knows all about the trees.

37:01.871 --> 37:04.396
Aha!

37:04.396 --> 37:06.267
There is no part
about the trees.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.703
I made that up.

37:07.703 --> 37:10.619
There's a part.
A whole tree thing.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.795
A whole pine and birch
scenario.

37:12.795 --> 37:15.102
They have not told you
anything, have they?

37:15.102 --> 37:16.886
You are nothing to the Greys.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.933
You're a circus monkey
that does tricks for food.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.065
What if I am?
What if I don't know anything?

37:22.065 --> 37:24.111
Why are you so happy about it?
I was your only hope.

37:24.111 --> 37:27.462
If I don't know anything,
your mission has failed.

37:27.462 --> 37:30.248
And so has yours.
You have to leave Patience now.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.466
Oh, why is that?

37:31.466 --> 37:35.078
Because I do not like
your square face.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.733
And if you do not leave,
I will tell the Greys

37:37.733 --> 37:39.735
how many humans know
you're an alien.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.998
Three of them are children.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.000
I do not think
they will let you live.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.004
I will leave
when I want to leave.

37:48.004 --> 37:51.530
Lucky for you,
I want to leave right now.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.105
You're leaving
because I told you to leave.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.324
Uh, no.

38:03.324 --> 38:04.978
I just happen
to want to leave so badly

38:04.978 --> 38:06.458
that I don't care about staying
just so you don't think

38:06.458 --> 38:08.024
that I'm leaving
because you told me to leave.

38:08.024 --> 38:10.984
The only thing I understood
in that was "leave."

38:13.291 --> 38:14.335
I'm leaving.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.343
Go ahead.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.302
I do not even care
about that one.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.917
<i>It was my favorite.</i>

38:45.801 --> 38:49.109
Ugh.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.241
Hello.

38:51.241 --> 38:54.375
Haven't heard from you
for a couple of days.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.246
How's everything going?

38:56.246 --> 38:59.337
Oh, I have it
all under control.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.817
Too much good to say
in one phone call.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.482
You're not gonna tell him
about the Darling Project?

39:14.482 --> 39:19.618
That's strictly need to know,
and he doesn't.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.315
You can go.

39:27.277 --> 39:30.411
<i>When someone you love

39:30.411 --> 39:32.979
<i>everything changes.</i>

39:32.979 --> 39:36.722
<i>It is a loss
that stays with you forever.</i>

39:41.509 --> 39:43.903
<i>When I came to Earth,
I was unique.</i>

39:43.903 --> 39:45.426
<i>I was superior.</i>

39:45.426 --> 39:48.342
<i>But living as a human
is making me weaker.</i>

39:48.342 --> 39:50.866

40:30.471 --> 40:33.605
Yes, I'm in the middle
of a thought.

40:33.605 --> 40:34.954
<i>Failure.</i>

40:38.958 --> 40:41.482
What do you want?

40:41.482 --> 40:43.397
Well, I was hoping

40:43.397 --> 40:45.051
that you could take a look
at my foot.

40:45.051 --> 40:48.968
No, sorry, I do not have
internet foot kink money.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.710
No, no, as a doctor.

40:51.710 --> 40:55.322
See I--see, I have this bump,

40:55.322 --> 40:59.152
and, yeah,
it's probably nothing,

40:59.152 --> 41:01.502
but I just want
to get it checked out.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.504
Where did you get this?

41:03.504 --> 41:05.158
Oh, I don't know.

41:05.158 --> 41:06.246
I've had it since I was a kid.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.508
Oh.

41:07.508 --> 41:09.205
<i>I do know.</i>

41:09.205 --> 41:12.339
<i>This embedded chip means
he has been abducted by Greys.</i>

41:12.339 --> 41:14.210
<i>I have been trying to learn
what the Greys are doing</i>

41:14.210 --> 41:16.212
<i>on Earth, and perhaps
the answer has been</i>

41:16.212 --> 41:19.041
<i>in Mayor Snowflake's foot
all along.</i>

41:19.041 --> 41:22.392
I need to hypnotize you.

41:22.392 --> 41:25.744
To determine the origin
of this disfiguration.

41:25.744 --> 41:28.181
Can't you just remove it?

41:28.181 --> 41:31.489
Yes, but we're
out of anesthetic.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.621
Hypnosis is fine.

41:33.621 --> 41:36.232
Listen only to the sound
of my voice.

41:36.232 --> 41:40.019
When you wake up, you will
remember nothing of this.

41:40.019 --> 41:42.500
But you will still pay me
for the hour.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.851
Now, tell me everything
that you remember

41:45.851 --> 41:49.289
from your last abduction.

41:51.117 --> 41:55.077
There was...

41:55.077 --> 41:57.645
a lot of floating.

41:57.645 --> 42:00.387
<i>Floating down a hallway.</i>

42:00.387 --> 42:02.781
<i>I'm cold. I hate it here.</i>

42:02.781 --> 42:04.957
Oh, God, I feel sick.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.612
OK.
I don't care about--about that.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.875
Tell me something I can use.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.619
I'm passing a--

42:17.665 --> 42:19.711
I'm passing a doorway.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.887
What's through the doorway?

42:21.887 --> 42:25.064
I don't know.
I think there's a--

42:25.064 --> 42:26.674
<i>I think there's a map.</i>

42:26.674 --> 42:27.936
What is on the map?

42:27.936 --> 42:29.111
Mm.

42:29.111 --> 42:32.027
I can't--I can't see it.

42:32.027 --> 42:35.248
I--oh, God, I'm scared.

42:37.337 --> 42:39.426
Please, I--
I gotta get out of here.

42:39.426 --> 42:41.341
I don't want to be here.
I want to go home.

42:41.341 --> 42:42.864
I need you to listen to me.

42:42.864 --> 42:44.605
This is important.

42:44.605 --> 42:45.998
Just tell me what you see.

42:45.998 --> 42:47.521
What do you see?

42:47.521 --> 42:51.351
I need to know what these
beings are doing on Earth.

42:51.351 --> 42:52.700
There's all these shoes.

42:56.008 --> 42:58.837
There's all these
children's shoes.

42:58.837 --> 43:01.535
Oh.

43:01.535 --> 43:03.842
There's--there's something.

43:03.842 --> 43:08.324
It's a--a souvenir maybe?

43:08.324 --> 43:10.631
<i>A snow globe that says...</i>

43:13.416 --> 43:14.635
Yellowstone.

43:14.635 --> 43:17.377
Yellowstone?

43:19.335 --> 43:20.598
Yes.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.383
When I snap my fingers,
you will wake up

43:23.383 --> 43:25.864
and you will remember nothing.

43:25.864 --> 43:30.477
In three, two, one.
