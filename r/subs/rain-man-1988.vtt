03:06.687 --> 03:09.480
I spoke to Mr. Babbitt on
that just this morning.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.732
I'm still sitting on
four Lamborghinis

03:11.733 --> 03:13.234
that can't make the smog
emission standards.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.528
Now, how many times you
wash out with EPA?

03:15.529 --> 03:18.781
Yes, they're finally clearing EPA.
Just one or two more days.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.283
Three times? We're really
on a roll here, my friend.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.953
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for 12.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.663
What are you? A mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

03:25.664 --> 03:28.791
Now, listen. I told you I've never
dealt with these Lamborghinis before,

03:28.792 --> 03:32.128
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver these cars within that time frame.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.588
Don't tell me that, 'cause
I'm not even listening.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.799
Well, sir, I hardly
think that's necessary.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.510
Well, I'll explain that to my swing loan.
I'm sure he'll be very sympathetic.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.471
I'm into him for 200,000. That's
thousand, my friend, three zeros.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.931
I got all my money
tied up in these cars,

03:43.932 --> 03:45.182
and if I don't get my money out,

03:45.183 --> 03:47.643
I am over, I am finished.
Do you understand that?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.603
You have to understand
our situation here.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.523
I don't give a shit about your problems.
I got a shark snapping at my heels here.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.942
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.152
They're collateral,
for Christ's sake.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.570
Got to hold 'em off with
a whip and a chair here.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.322
I understand that, I know
delivery is way overdue.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.907
Fuckin' EPA...

04:01.908 --> 04:03.325
Whole world is choking on smog,

04:03.326 --> 04:04.452
and they're gonna
correct the situation

04:04.453 --> 04:05.995
by keeping my four
cars off the road?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.582
Babbitt Collectibles.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.668
Have you tried cash? How much can
one of these EPA guys earn in a week?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.587
Charlie, it's Wyatt.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.713
- Wyatt?
- Yeah.

04:15.714 --> 04:16.839
About the swing loan.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.548
If he doesn't get
the money by 5:30,

04:18.550 --> 04:20.341
he's gonna come and
seize all the cars.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.677
I'm gonna have to call you back.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.512
I really think you should
talk to Mr. Babbitt on this.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.514
Tell him that you don't understand.
I signed a check on Tuesday,

04:25.515 --> 04:28.434
you personally watched me sign it, and
then you gave it to the mail girl.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.685
Come on! I need this!

04:29.686 --> 04:30.853
Come on!

04:30.854 --> 04:33.773
I wouldn't do that, sir, until you
talk to Mr. Babbitt personally.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.525
A number for him? No,
he's on the road just now.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.527
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.779
Just tell him I'm
connecting to Barbados,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.405
arriving 1:30 a.m.,
can he leave a number?

04:41.406 --> 04:42.698
- Charlie!
- What, Lenny?

04:42.699 --> 04:43.949
I'm standing here.
Talk to me, talk to me.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.869
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.662
They want their down payments back.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.081
They found two cars at Valley Motors,
and they want to go that way.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.042
Tell him that was me
on the other line,

04:53.043 --> 04:54.502
that the cars just
passed emissions,

04:54.503 --> 04:56.420
that the EPA paperwork will
be in here momentarily...

04:56.421 --> 04:59.673
- You paying attention, Lenny?
- Yeah, I am, I'm listening.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.926
Tell them also that I'm knocking
off five grand on both their deals

05:01.927 --> 05:03.010
because I appreciate
their patience.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.804
- Now, do you understand that?
- I understand that, I've got it.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.027
- Are you sure that you've got that?
- I got it.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.310
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other line.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.355
As it happens, the cars
are passing emissions...

05:14.356 --> 05:16.899
What am I saying? The cars
have passed emissions.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.402
We're just waiting for the EPA paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.113
And because of your
incredible patience,

05:23.114 --> 05:28.285
we're going to knock off
$5,000 on each car.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.746
Well, yes, you've
been most patient.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.374
We really appreciate your patience.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.251
Well, thank you.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.395
Thank you.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.881
Ready for Palm Springs?

05:40.882 --> 05:43.259
Charlie, you still want to
go with all these problems?

05:43.260 --> 05:46.387
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.972
Not bad for a couple
of phone calls, huh?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.306
No, not bad at all.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.891
You know where to find
us, right, Lenny?

05:50.892 --> 05:54.787
Right. I got it under control.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.086
Listen, I don't want
to be demanding here,

06:19.087 --> 06:22.131
but do you think, could you possibly
say, I don't know, 10 or 12 words

06:22.132 --> 06:24.775
before we get to the hotel?

06:25.468 --> 06:28.020
Consider it foreplay.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.407
Can you include me in
some of your thoughts?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.267
I'm just thinking.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.685
You know, nothing special.
I'm just thinking.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.937
Maybe there's something that you're
thinking about that we can talk.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.647
You know, make a
little conversation.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.525
If there's something to talk about,
Susanna, we'd be talking about it.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.694
I'm just thinking. What's the big
to-do about me thinking here?

06:43.695 --> 06:45.154
I don't know, Charlie.
I just feel like

06:45.155 --> 06:47.823
I'm going away for a
few days with someone.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.908
Call me crazy.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.618
Okay, you wanna talk, let's talk.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.762
- How was your day?
- I don't want to talk! I feel like...

06:52.788 --> 06:55.497
- you're excluding me from what's going on.
- No, let's talk!

06:55.498 --> 06:56.832
It's not that I want to talk.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.127
One of these again, Susanna. How
did we get back to one of these?

07:00.128 --> 07:03.422
I don't know why I put
up with all this.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.133
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're going to Palm Springs.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.843
Yes, but I didn't want to go alone.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.887
I've been sitting in this car for
more than an hour and a half...

07:09.888 --> 07:12.514
You want to talk,
let's talk! Let's talk!

07:12.515 --> 07:14.350
This is not talking, this
is you going like...

07:15.936 --> 07:17.478
Yeah.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.021
<i>Charlie, this is Lenny.</i>

07:19.022 --> 07:21.565
<i>I've been trying to
contact you for a while.</i>

07:21.566 --> 07:24.485
<i>I got a long-distance
call from a Mr. Mooney,</i>

07:24.486 --> 07:28.005
<i>your father's lawyer.
He's been trying to reach you.</i>

07:28.239 --> 07:30.616
<i>Your father has died, Charlie.</i>

07:30.617 --> 07:32.743
<i>- Charlie?</i>
- Uh-huh.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.204
<i>I'm sorry. The funeral's
tomorrow in Cincinnati.</i>

07:35.205 --> 07:37.247
<i>He said you'd know where.</i>

07:37.248 --> 07:38.832
<i>I've got his number.</i>

07:38.833 --> 07:40.918
That's not necessary.
Anything else?

07:40.919 --> 07:43.295
<i>No, that's it. Listen, Charlie,
if there's anything I can do...</i>

07:43.296 --> 07:44.456
- All right.
<i>- ...just call...</i>

07:48.843 --> 07:50.886
Sorry about the weekend, hon.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.429
Charlie, the weekend?

07:52.430 --> 07:56.058
Look, I told you before, we had
a falling out a long time ago.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.644
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.698
We just didn't get along.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.899
You're going to the funeral, no?

08:03.900 --> 08:05.109
Yeah.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.318
I'm coming with you.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.780
That's really sweet, but there's
really no point, you know?

08:09.781 --> 08:11.699
I want to. That's the point.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.845
All right. Sorry, I forgot
who I was talking to.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.431
...for our memory, admiration

08:35.432 --> 08:37.599
and respect for him

08:37.600 --> 08:41.270
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.648
Let us consecrate ourselves
to follow his example

08:44.649 --> 08:46.400
of zest for life,

08:46.401 --> 08:48.444
dedication to family,

08:48.445 --> 08:51.247
and charity to all.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.909
And now, with sure and certain
hope of resurrection, life,

08:55.910 --> 09:00.260
we commend to you the soul
of our departed friend.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.967
Just have to go over the details
of the will with him tonight,

09:11.968 --> 09:13.218
then we're outta here.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.192
Sure, I can wait in
the car if you like.

09:52.175 --> 09:56.553
Somebody should be watering
those roses, they're all dying.

09:56.554 --> 10:00.057
I knew this car my whole
life. Only drove it once.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.185
It's a 1949 Buick
Roadmaster convertible.

10:03.186 --> 10:07.356
Only 8,000 production models
made. Straight-8. Fireball-8.

10:07.357 --> 10:11.161
It was the first full year of
the Dynaflow transmission.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.871
I know it by rote.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.130
You were his only child.

10:31.131 --> 10:36.732
You came along when he was,
what, 45 or something?

10:36.886 --> 10:39.596
Probably thought he was
never going to have a son.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.944
So he had to love you.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.392
I think you're exaggerating.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.895
You were his child,
his son, his blood.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.064
Anyway, in these pictures here,
he doesn't look like a man

10:49.065 --> 10:51.024
- who doesn't love his child.
- What are you doing looking at this?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.067
- Put that away.
- No.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.322
Put that away. You
wanna hear a story?

10:54.348 --> 10:55.737
- I'll tell you one story.
- But don't get mad.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.915
I'm just saying. You know the
convertible in the garage? His baby.

10:57.941 --> 11:00.868
- That and the goddamn roses.
- Buick.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.829
The car was off-limits to me.
"That's a classic," he'd say.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.873
"It commands respect.
It's not for children."

11:05.874 --> 11:08.208
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years
old, and for once,

11:08.209 --> 11:11.128
I bring home a report card
and it's almost all A's.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.673
I go to my old man,
"Can I take the car out?"

11:14.674 --> 11:17.217
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.844
He says no.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.138
I take it anyway. I steal
the keys, I sneak it out.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.764
You took the car
with no permission?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.142
- Yes.
- Why? Why then?

11:25.143 --> 11:28.020
Because I deserved it.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.355
Nothing I did was good
enough for this guy.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.440
Don't you understand that?

11:31.441 --> 11:34.234
We're on Columbia
Parkway, four kids.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.653
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

11:36.654 --> 11:38.488
Pulled over.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.584
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.828
- Can I finish?
- Yes.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.580
He called in a report
of a stolen car,

11:46.581 --> 11:49.124
not his son took the car
without permission,

11:49.125 --> 11:53.295
just stolen. Central station, the other
guys' dads bail them out in an hour,

11:53.296 --> 11:56.715
- he left me there two days.
- He left you in prison for two days?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.517
Two days.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.487
Were you scared?

12:01.888 --> 12:04.031
Yeah, I was scared.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.893
Left home. I never saw him again.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.270
Charlie, after a year
we've been together,

12:10.271 --> 12:12.731
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.566
It's strange, no?

12:14.567 --> 12:18.654
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

12:18.655 --> 12:20.239
When I was a kid and I got scared,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.168
the Rain Man would
come and sing to me.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.628
Rain what?

12:26.955 --> 12:30.258
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.251
What happened to him?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.975
Nothing. I just grew up.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.005
Not so much.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.343
<i>"And I remember, too,
the day you left home,</i>

12:41.344 --> 12:44.346
<i>"so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas,</i>

12:44.347 --> 12:46.473
<i>"so full of yourself.</i>

12:46.474 --> 12:48.016
<i>"And being raised without a mother,</i>

12:48.017 --> 12:50.852
<i>"the hardness of your heart
is understandable, as well.</i>

12:50.853 --> 12:55.190
"Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me,

12:55.191 --> 12:56.900
"all these I forgive.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.319
"But your failure to
write, to telephone,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.196
"to reenter my life in any way,

13:01.197 --> 13:03.073
"has left me without a son.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.200
"I wish you all I
ever wanted for you.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.719
"I wish you the best."

13:12.709 --> 13:16.420
"I hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt,

13:16.421 --> 13:18.588
"that certain Buick convertible,

13:18.589 --> 13:23.051
"the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

13:23.052 --> 13:27.222
"Also, outright title to my
prize-winning hybrid rosebushes.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.516
"May they remind him of
the value of excellence

13:29.517 --> 13:31.727
"and the possibility of perfection.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.730
"As for my home and all other
property, real and personal,

13:34.731 --> 13:36.773
"these shall be placed in trust

13:36.774 --> 13:39.067
"in accordance with the terms
of that certain instrument

13:39.068 --> 13:41.486
"executed concurrently herewith."

13:41.487 --> 13:43.071
The last part, what does that mean?

13:43.072 --> 13:44.531
It means that the estate,

13:44.532 --> 13:49.453
in excess of $3 million
after expenses and taxes,

13:49.454 --> 13:51.330
will go into a trust fund

13:51.331 --> 13:53.790
for a beneficiary to be
named in this document.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.417
Who is that?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.210
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.795
Who controls the money?
You? You control the money?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.505
No, it's called a trustee.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.883
What is that? How does that work?
How does that work?

14:02.884 --> 14:06.553
Forgive me, but there's
nothing more I can say.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.765
Now, I'm sorry, son. I can see
that you're disappointed.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.350
Disappointed? Why should
I be disappointed?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.935
I got rosebushes, didn't I?
I got a used car, didn't I?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.937
What's-his-name got...
What'd you call him?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.732
- Beneficiary.
- Right, beneficiary. He got $3 million.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.734
But he didn't get the rosebushes.
I got the rosebushes.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.069
I definitely got the rosebushes.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.071
- Charles...
- I definitely got the rosebushes.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.822
- I mean, those are rosebushes.
- There is no need...

14:25.823 --> 14:27.532
To what?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.755
To be upset?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.587
To be upset?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.206
If there is a hell, sir,

14:34.207 --> 14:36.792
my father is in it, and he
is looking up right now

14:36.793 --> 14:40.014
and he is laughing his
ass off. Sanford Babbitt,

14:40.040 --> 14:42.996
you want to be that guy's son for five
minutes? Did you hear that letter?

14:42.997 --> 14:47.557
- Were you listening?
- Yes, sir, I was. Were you?

14:47.970 --> 14:52.400
No. Could you repeat it?
I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.955
I was looking for you.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.666
How did it go?

15:01.526 --> 15:03.748
I got what I expected.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.726
Susanna, this could
take a few minutes.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.647
Can I help you?

15:40.648 --> 15:41.940
Yes, I think you can.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.734
I have a problem with
a private trust...

15:44.735 --> 15:47.487
- That's a terrific suit.
- Thank you.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.211
My father was Sanford Babbitt...

15:58.833 --> 16:00.976
Is this Wallbrook?

16:01.043 --> 16:03.044
Excuse me. Is this Wallbrook?

16:03.045 --> 16:05.017
Excuse me.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.889
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.432
Would you like to wait
in his outer office?

16:15.433 --> 16:18.531
No, we'll stay here. Thank you.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.911
Maybe we're not supposed to
be looking around here, no?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.514
<i>Good to have you here. Good
luck to all three of you.</i>

16:55.515 --> 16:58.808
<i>$20 starts you all off on a very
important match, starts with this.</i>

16:58.809 --> 17:02.771
<i>In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie
Hawn get away from it all? Lisa?</i>

17:02.772 --> 17:03.897
<i>- Lisa?</i>
- Private Benjamin.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.952
Excuse me, please. I want
to watch the TV, please.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.237
<i>For whose grandson</i>

17:10.238 --> 17:13.281
<i>was the presidential retreat
Camp David named? Lisa?</i>

17:13.281 --> 17:15.617
<i>- Eisenhower.
- That's right. For David Eisenhower.</i>

17:15.617 --> 17:18.744
<i>You've got another five.
$10 lead for Lisa.</i>

17:18.746 --> 17:23.517
<i>In days of yore, what would a
swashbuckler keep in his sheath?</i>

17:48.317 --> 17:51.820
Whatever this is, I don't
understand the point of secrecy.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.197
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.992
Mr. Babbitt, I knew your father
since you were two years old.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.285
The year my mother died.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.828
Look, I'm trustee of the fund,

17:59.829 --> 18:01.538
but this hospital receives
nothing from that.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.374
That hardly seems fair. Maybe that's
something that we could discuss.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.835
I took on this burden out
of loyalty to your father.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.461
That's where my loyalty ends.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.630
And you think I should feel
a little of that loyalty?

18:10.631 --> 18:13.341
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright

18:13.342 --> 18:16.553
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.848
And I think if I were in your
shoes, I'd probably feel the same.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.349
I was hoping that we could talk,

18:21.350 --> 18:23.059
that you would explain
my father's side of it,

18:23.060 --> 18:24.769
help me understand the
right in what he's done,

18:24.770 --> 18:28.023
because, failing that, I have
responsibilities of my own,

18:28.024 --> 18:30.942
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.528
Sorry, this is not your car.
It's my boyfriend's.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.905
Yeah, my dad lets me drive
slow on the driveway.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.324
I'm an excellent driver.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.867
Are you sure that
you drive this car?

18:38.868 --> 18:42.996
There's only 28 miles on the odometer since
I drove it a week ago, last Saturday.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.706
Should be more than 28 miles.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.541
Look, my boyfriend is coming.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.043
Course, today's Monday.

18:48.044 --> 18:51.171
I always drive the car on
Saturday, never drive on Monday.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.339
What is this? Who is this guy?

18:52.340 --> 18:53.882
I don't know, he
jumped into the car.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.300
Well, he can jump out.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.468
I'm an excellent driver.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.862
That's good. Come on, come on.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.349
Why did you let him get in
this car? It's not a toy.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.392
He says he... He says
he drives this car.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.645
Dad lets me drive slow on the
driveway every Saturday.

19:06.646 --> 19:11.608
Course, the seats were originally brown
leather, now they're pitiful red.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.377
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.237
You know this car?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.506
I know this car.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.118
How do you know this car?

19:22.119 --> 19:24.412
Definitely know this car.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.

19:24.413 --> 19:28.667
Straight-S, Fireball-8.
Only 8,095 production models.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.252
Dad lets me drive slow on the
driveway, but not on Monday.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.379
Definitely not on Monday.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.673
- Who's your dad?
- Sanford Babbitt.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.757
Sanford Babbitt?

19:35.758 --> 19:39.528
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.888
That's my address.
What is it with this guy?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.473
Hey, who's your mother?

19:43.474 --> 19:44.599
Eleanor Babbitt.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.725
Eleanor?

19:45.726 --> 19:48.311
Died January 5, 1965, after
a short and sudden illness.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.437
Who the hell are you?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.605
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?

19:50.606 --> 19:52.023
Wait a second, where are you going?

19:52.024 --> 19:54.442
Thirteen minutes to Judge
Wapner and <i>The People's Court.</i>

19:54.443 --> 19:56.569
Hold it, wait a second here,
I want to ask you a question.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.364
"What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not..."

19:59.365 --> 20:01.667
Hey, I'm talking to you!

20:02.451 --> 20:05.120
Bruner, who is this guy?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.663
Raymond is your brother.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.456
"...have their dispute
settled here in our forum,

20:08.457 --> 20:09.541
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:12.210
My brother? I don't have a brother.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.004
"...court cases, and have their
dispute settled here in our forum,

20:15.005 --> 20:16.131
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

20:17.967 --> 20:20.260
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

20:20.261 --> 20:22.654
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

20:24.098 --> 20:26.775
The People's Court.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.436
<i>Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,</i>

20:29.437 --> 20:31.980
<i>and welcome to</i> The People's Court.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.815
- What, is he crazy?
- No.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.483
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.318
Well, he's not crazy, he's
not retarded, but he's here.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.237
He's an autistic savant.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.697
I don't know what that means.

20:40.698 --> 20:43.199
Some people like him used
to be called idiot savants.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.161
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.495
Yeah, but he's retarded.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.998
Autistic. Actually,
high-functioning.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.875
What does that mean?

20:51.876 --> 20:54.169
It means that there's a disability

20:54.170 --> 20:57.338
that impairs the sensory input
and how it's processed.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.674
English here. You're
talking over my head.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.135
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.386
He can't even express himself,

21:03.387 --> 21:05.472
or probably even

21:05.473 --> 21:08.492
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.479
<i>...and after that, the dog bit him.</i>

21:12.480 --> 21:14.981
<i>I yelled at my dog,
the dog laid down...</i>

21:14.982 --> 21:17.025
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.111
Routines, rituals, it's all
he has to protect himself.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.614
Rituals. That's a good one.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.450
It's the way he acts,

21:25.451 --> 21:27.035
sleeps, eats,

21:27.036 --> 21:29.788
uses the bathroom, walks,
talks, everything.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.457
Any break from the routines,
and it's terrifying.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.833
How long has he been here?

21:33.834 --> 21:35.376
Well, let's see.
I came here in 1960.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.128
No, how old is he?

21:37.129 --> 21:39.756
He was 18 or 20 then. I'd
have to check the records...

21:39.757 --> 21:42.342
- You've been here that long?
- That's when I actually started.

21:42.343 --> 21:45.303
So that's '65, '75, '85.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.222
I was almost three years old
and you knew he had a brother,

21:47.223 --> 21:49.808
you knew I was his brother.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.184
Yes, but what's the point?

21:51.185 --> 21:53.186
What's the point? What's
the fuckin' point is

21:53.187 --> 21:55.313
why didn't anybody tell
me I had a brother?

21:55.314 --> 21:58.412
What would you have done about it?

21:58.567 --> 22:00.539
I don't know.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.198
Does he know how much
money he's been left?

22:05.199 --> 22:08.878
No, he doesn't understand
the concept of money.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.080
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.457
He's just inherited $3 million,

22:14.458 --> 22:17.377
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

22:17.378 --> 22:20.463
That is fucking poetic,

22:20.464 --> 22:22.937
don't you think?

22:23.884 --> 22:26.052
Good old Dad.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.762
...name's yes. Then
who's playing first? Yes.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.514
I mean the fellow's name
on first base. Who.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.599
The fellow playing first
base for St. Louis. Who.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.352
- What are you asking me for?
- What is this? Why is he doing that?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.396
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does "Who's on First?"

22:36.397 --> 22:38.940
- You know, from Abbott and Costello.
- Yeah. Why?

22:38.941 --> 22:42.527
Why? It's his way of dealing with you
touching things, his books and stuff.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.612
So he memorized "Who's on First?"

22:44.613 --> 22:46.281
Yeah, that among other things.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.157
Raymond, Ted Klus-zesski.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.617
- Kluszewski.
- Kluszewski.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.287
Kluszewski, Ted Kluszewski,
Big Klew, first base.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.621
He played for Cincinnati?

22:53.622 --> 22:55.957
Course, he was traded
for Dee Fondy, 1957.

22:55.958 --> 22:59.127
- Lifetime batting average .298.
- All these great books. He reads, huh?

22:59.128 --> 23:02.005
Reads and remembers whatever
he gets his hands on.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.967
Oh, Vern. V-E-R-N!

23:05.968 --> 23:08.636
Course, these people are
gonna be here all day, Vern.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.847
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.850
This is definitely not
a weekend visit, Vern.

23:13.851 --> 23:17.450
- He's getting anxious. It's okay, Ray!
- Oh, Vern!

23:18.647 --> 23:20.565
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.400
Put it back. He said not
to touch the books.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.651
Not to touch books.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.778
- You like Shakespeare, Ray?
- I don't know.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.405
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.656
- You don't know?
- Vern.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.991
- Did you read <i>Macbeth</i> ?
- I don't know. Vern.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.826
- You read <i>Hamlet</i> ?
- I don't know. Vern!

23:31.827 --> 23:33.536
- Read the <i>Twelfth Night</i> ?
- Stop it!

23:33.537 --> 23:34.621
- Yes.
- Yes?

23:34.622 --> 23:35.705
Yes.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.333
You read all these stories
that are in this book,

23:38.334 --> 23:39.792
and you don't know if
you read the book?

23:39.793 --> 23:41.002
I don't know. V-E-R-N.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.045
You don't know?

23:42.046 --> 23:44.689
Maybe you better put it back.

23:45.007 --> 23:49.232
You don't know, okay. No, Ray,
take it easy, I'm not going to...

23:49.345 --> 23:51.554
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.765
It's okay, Ray. It's okay. Come on.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.974
My main man.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.976
Yeah, Vern, my main man.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.311
My main man, Vern.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.659
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.191
- My main man.
- Yeah, my main man.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.567
Here.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.693
Here are your cards.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.904
I'm sorry, I didn't know where
you want me to put them.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.907
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

24:14.370 --> 24:16.329
He likes you. That's just
his way of showing it.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.747
Uh-oh.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.874
When I touched him
before, he pulled away.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.542
Don't take it personal.

24:21.543 --> 24:22.919
He never touched me.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.629
I'm closer to him than
anybody in the world.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.714
Known him for nine years.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.216
It's not in him.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.884
If I left town tomorrow
and didn't say goodbye...

24:29.885 --> 24:31.928
- Uh-oh.
- ...he'd never notice.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.888
He wouldn't notice if you left?

24:33.889 --> 24:37.693
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.603
Hey, Ray, you want
to go take a walk?

24:40.604 --> 24:42.701
Hmm? Ray?

24:43.649 --> 24:45.024
Ray?

24:45.025 --> 24:48.069
Can he hear us when he's like that?

24:48.070 --> 24:50.154
Hey, man. You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

24:50.155 --> 24:53.549
Course, it's 27
minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

24:53.575 --> 24:55.952
Don't worry, Ray, we'll
bring you right back.

24:55.953 --> 24:58.329
Practically 26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

24:58.330 --> 24:59.622
We'll bring him right back.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.332
26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

25:01.333 --> 25:02.750
I won't do it.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.793
I can't do it.

25:03.794 --> 25:08.506
First of all because of your tone
of voice, this commanding...

25:08.507 --> 25:09.757
You're upset. Just calm down.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.092
And second thing is because
you didn't tell me why.

25:11.093 --> 25:13.469
- Raymond, I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.
- Bye, Raymond.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.931
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.599
No. Just stay.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.226
Just stay there.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.770
No, Raymond. Raymond.
Raymond. Raymond!

25:22.771 --> 25:27.608
Just stay there. Just stand
still, okay? That's good.

25:27.609 --> 25:31.413
Okay, I'll do it if you tell
me why. Why do I do, uh...

25:32.364 --> 25:33.448
What?

25:33.449 --> 25:36.117
Why do I have to take the
car and go down there

25:36.118 --> 25:37.910
and wait for you again at the gate?

25:37.911 --> 25:39.662
- I've been waiting for you for days.
- No.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.956
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.929
The car disturbs him.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.803
- That's why?
- That's why.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.672
Okay, Raymond.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.434
What are you looking at, Ray?

26:01.435 --> 26:03.061
Ray, the ducks are over here,
what are you looking at?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.034
I don't know.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.359
Listen, our father died.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.403
Did you know that he died last
week, did they tell you that?

26:12.404 --> 26:13.613
I don't know.

26:13.614 --> 26:17.634
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

26:18.494 --> 26:22.163
That means he's gone. He's not with
us anymore. He's at the cemetery.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.664
You want to go see him
at the cemetery, Ray?

26:23.665 --> 26:24.916
I don't know.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.001
Does that mean maybe? Does
that mean maybe you wanna go?

26:27.002 --> 26:28.974
I don't know.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.091
You know, I live in Los Angeles.

26:33.092 --> 26:37.178
I thought maybe you'd go to Los
Angeles, like to see a Dodger game.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.680
Go see the Dodgers play.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.848
Today's an off day.

26:40.849 --> 26:41.891
We don't have to go today.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.142
Monday. No games scheduled.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.144
Just thought maybe you'd like
to go to Los Angeles with me,

26:45.145 --> 26:47.605
you know, go see Fernando
Valenzuela pitch.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.608
Fernando Valenzuela pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch till Wednesday.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.194
- He's gonna pitch on Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.904
I'm not doing anything
on Wednesday.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.030
Yeah, Wednesday.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.832
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.251
Come on, Ray.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.497
Course, it's a long
way to California.

27:04.498 --> 27:08.084
I'm definitely not supposed to be off
the grounds for more than two hours.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.752
Definitely have to be
back in two hours.

27:09.753 --> 27:13.005
Wait till you get there. The people,
crowds cheering. You'll love it.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.308
Have to be back in two hours.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.485
- Here's the Presidential Suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.320
And to the left is Raymond's room.

28:59.321 --> 29:00.613
Look at this big,
beautiful room, huh, Ray?

29:00.614 --> 29:02.990
This is not my room, this
is definitely not my room.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.575
It's just for tonight, Ray.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.369
Have to go back to
Wallbrook for dinner.

29:06.370 --> 29:07.870
Little guy, little guy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:07.871 --> 29:08.996
This is gonna be terrific.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.915
We're brothers. Dr. Bruner wants
us to spend time together.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.291
We're gonna have some fun.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.709
- When did he say that?
- He said that.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.169
Course, I don't have
my tapioca pudding.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.712
We have tapioca
pudding for dessert.

29:16.713 --> 29:19.966
Yeah, well, we can do that. We can work
tapioca pudding, I'm gonna call Lenny.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.760
Course, this is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding,

29:22.761 --> 29:23.844
and the bed's in the wrong place.

29:23.845 --> 29:24.929
That's definitely not my bed.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.180
You don't like it
there, you can move it.

29:26.181 --> 29:29.642
- Where do you want the bed, Raymond?
- Should be near the window.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.395
Course, I don't have my books.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.854
Course, there are no bookshelves.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.774
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be bookless.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.276
Here's a book.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.695
Big telephone book, huh?
Lot of words.

29:40.696 --> 29:42.863
Lenny, pick up, will you?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.573
I got $200,000 about to
go in the shit house,

29:44.574 --> 29:46.492
and he doesn't wanna
answer the phone.

29:46.493 --> 29:49.245
What is it, 6:00 here? That means
it's 9:00 there, huh, Susanna?

29:49.246 --> 29:51.622
- No, it's 3:00 there.
- 6:30 p.m. is dinner.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.873
It's 3:00 there.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.376
It's 3:00, he doesn't
want to answer the phone?

29:55.377 --> 29:57.795
Orange soda.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.880
Has to be in a can with a straw.
Room temperature.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.883
Bruner told you that
you should do this?

30:02.884 --> 30:04.510
- Huh?
- It doesn't make sense to me.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.029
I know what's good for him.

30:25.449 --> 30:26.574
Uh-oh!

30:26.575 --> 30:28.200
Uh-oh! V-E-R-N!

30:28.201 --> 30:31.845
Oh, God. Go see what
he's doing, will you?

30:32.372 --> 30:33.581
Ray?

30:33.582 --> 30:36.292
- V-E-R-N! Home... Home...
- What is it, Ray? Huh?

30:36.293 --> 30:37.710
What's happening, homes?

30:37.711 --> 30:39.628
- Uh-oh.
- It's fine, everything is fine.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.422
Charlie, let's take
him home. Come on.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.007
No, he's okay.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.592
We'll just get him some
dinner, he'll be all right.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.761
What'd you say you
wanted? Hamburger?

30:46.762 --> 30:48.262
Hamburger, Ray? Huh?

30:48.263 --> 30:51.057
Course, we have pepperoni pizza
Monday night for dinner.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.476
Pizza? You get pizza
in the institution?

30:53.477 --> 30:55.936
Course, Monday night's
Italian Night.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.271
<i>Hello, offices of
Mitchell & Mitchell.</i>

30:57.272 --> 30:59.106
Yeah, get me Stu. This is
Charlie Babbitt calling.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.317
<i>I'm sorry, he's not here.</i>

31:01.318 --> 31:03.903
Where is he? I got a bit
of a legal problem here.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.280
<i>He's out of town until
tomorrow afternoon.</i>

31:06.281 --> 31:08.924
All right, I'll call him tomorrow.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.996
No TV during dinnertime.
Definitely not.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.294
Yes, but we can watch TV here.

31:15.295 --> 31:17.933
- We can. We're allowed.
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.922
<i>"Wheel of Fortune!</i>

Pepperoni, right?

31:54.996 --> 31:56.414
No, I don't want pepperoni.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.582
That's right. A large pepperoni.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.584
- How long's that going to take?
<i>- 20 minutes.</i>

32:00.585 --> 32:02.711
Bring some beer up for
two, and orange soda.

got tapioca pudding?

32:04.381 --> 32:05.506
<i>No, sir, we don't have any.</i>

32:05.507 --> 32:09.176
Well, just bring the closest
thing. All right, great.

- Yeah.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.556
- Take this, and food is coming shortly.
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.405
- And I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

32:17.853 --> 32:22.624
Course, I'm going to be here for
a long time. A very long time.

32:22.899 --> 32:26.373
I'm gone for good, gone
for good from my home.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.614
<i>If I had said anything,
or did anything...</i>

32:30.615 --> 32:31.782
<i>Get out of here!</i>

33:15.744 --> 33:17.670
<i>What message?</i>

33:19.915 --> 33:21.999
<i>What message?</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:25.394
<i>Well, be that as it may,
someone called me...</i>

33:34.930 --> 33:37.223
- Oh, <i>si, si.
- Si.</i>

33:37.224 --> 33:39.141
<i>It's just lucky I got your message
and came over here in time.</i>

33:39.142 --> 33:41.194
<i>Why?</i>

33:45.023 --> 33:47.525
<i>J. J., Susie was so depressed
she tried to kill herself.</i>

33:52.113 --> 33:54.756
- Ah.
- Uh.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.301
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.036
What is that?

33:59.037 --> 34:02.289
- I think Raymond is in the room.
- What?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.457
Raymond, are you in here?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.584
Charlie, Charlie Babbitt.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.336
Well, get out.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.587
Get out!

34:08.588 --> 34:09.964
- Go!
- Stop it!

34:09.965 --> 34:11.891
Uh-oh.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.927
- Jesus Christ!
- Stop it.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.262
Go in there with him.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.596
- Come on, Charlie, go in there.
- What?

34:17.597 --> 34:18.806
- He's your brother.
- Why?

34:18.806 --> 34:21.308
He's afraid. He doesn't
understand this.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.110
Come on, go in there!

34:28.608 --> 34:31.107
Raymond, what were you doing in
my room? Raymond. Raymond!

34:31.132 --> 34:32.628
- What were you doing in my room?
- I don't know.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.530
You don't know what you
were doing in my room.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.609
- Course, there were noises.
- There were noises.

34:36.610 --> 34:40.411
Well, those noises are none of your
business, you understand that? Huh?

34:40.411 --> 34:43.038
Put the phone book down, stop acting
like an idiot, and go to sleep.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.331
Hey, did you hear what
I said? Go to sleep!

34:45.333 --> 34:46.500
Go to sleep!

34:46.501 --> 34:48.585
Course, it's nine minutes to
11:00. Lights out at 11:00.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.730
Yeah, well, new rules.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.145
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to me.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.479
What? What are you talking about?

35:07.480 --> 35:11.358
I asked you to go there and apologize.
You went there and insulted him again!

35:11.359 --> 35:13.527
What am I supposed to do,
tuck him in? I'm not his mother.

35:13.528 --> 35:17.221
Charlie, you're his brother. His brother!
They tell you today for the first time

35:17.247 --> 35:19.235
that you have a brother, and
I don't see in your face

35:19.236 --> 35:21.034
- one little reaction.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.078
I'm not saying joy,
I'm saying something.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.788
Take it easy, you don't know
what I'm going through here.

35:24.789 --> 35:25.873
No, I don't know what
you're going through.

35:25.874 --> 35:27.942
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

35:27.943 --> 35:29.960
Because you don't tell me anything.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.756
- You just give me lies, lies, lies.
- Lies, lies? What lies?

35:33.757 --> 35:37.092
The thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.304
I know it's not true. So why don't
you tell me, why is he here?

35:40.305 --> 35:41.388
'Cause I'm pissed at him.

35:41.389 --> 35:42.973
- At who?
- At my father.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.392
You're pissed at your father,
and you bring Raymond here why?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.353
I don't know why. 'Cause I
got him and they want him.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.429
- This makes no sense!
- Raymond was left all the money,

35:49.430 --> 35:51.099
- and I got nothing.
- How much?

35:51.100 --> 35:53.442
$3 million. The inheritance,
every penny of it.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.499
- So?
- So I'm gonna keep him till I get my half!

35:55.500 --> 35:57.313
I deserve that!

35:59.449 --> 36:03.093
What is this? Huh? Susanna?

36:03.745 --> 36:05.537
- Just take it easy here.
- I've had enough.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.748
What? You've had enough? What does
that mean, you've had enough?

36:07.749 --> 36:08.957
I've just had enough, I'm leaving.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.250
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.877
You're leaving me now? I need you.

36:11.878 --> 36:14.380
- I need you now.
- What? You need nobody.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.090
What does that mean?

36:16.091 --> 36:19.885
What? Just take it easy.
What is my crime here?

36:19.886 --> 36:22.846
- What is my goddamn crime?
- Your crime is that you use people!

36:22.847 --> 36:25.099
You're using Raymond!
You're using me!

36:25.100 --> 36:26.266
You use everybody.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.726
I'm using Raymond? Raymond!

36:27.727 --> 36:30.229
Raymond, am I using you?
Am I using you, Raymond?

36:30.230 --> 36:31.313
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

36:31.314 --> 36:33.607
He is answering a question
from a half-hour ago!

36:33.608 --> 36:35.275
What good is $3 million to him?

36:35.276 --> 36:38.028
That money is only just gonna sit
there for the rest of his life.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.822
And I need that money, you
know I need that money!

36:39.823 --> 36:42.199
Yeah, you need them, so it's
hardly like stealing, no?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.076
And when it's over, what
happens to Raymond?

36:44.077 --> 36:45.828
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or a better place.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.288
With the money, I will put
him in a better place.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.374
What difference does it make?
He is gonna be just the same!

36:50.375 --> 36:51.834
Only you have his money, yeah!

36:51.835 --> 36:53.669
His money? That man
was my father, too.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.046
What about my fuckin' half?
Where's my fuckin' half?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.297
I'm entitled to that money!

36:57.298 --> 36:58.674
You've kidnapped this man!

36:58.675 --> 37:00.217
- I did not take him.
- Yes, you did.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.136
I did not take him, I took my half.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.512
Which half? You're crazy!

37:03.513 --> 37:04.847
Yeah, it runs in the family.

37:04.848 --> 37:07.391
You're wet, soaking wet and you're gonna
leave in the middle of the night.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.476
Would you just... Just wait!

37:09.477 --> 37:11.895
My father has stuck
it to me all my life.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.605
- What do you want from me?
- I want out.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.578
Out.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.285
Stop it.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.871
Good morning. Coffee?

38:10.872 --> 38:12.873
Yes. That'd be good.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.042
Sally Dibbs. Dibbs, Sally.

38:15.043 --> 38:18.545
461-0192.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.893
How did you know my phone number?

38:21.925 --> 38:23.050
How'd you know that?

38:23.051 --> 38:25.177
You said read the telephone
book last night. Dibbs, Sally.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.446
461-0192.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.642
He remembers things,
little things sometimes.

38:31.643 --> 38:35.117
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.397
How'd you do that?

38:37.398 --> 38:39.274
- I don't know.
- You memorized the whole book?

38:39.275 --> 38:40.359
No.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.568
- You start from the beginning?
- Yeah.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.070
- How far did you get?
- "G."

38:43.071 --> 38:44.279
- "G"?
- "G." Gottsaken.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.823
William Marshall Gottsaken.

38:45.824 --> 38:49.093
- You memorized to "G"?
- Yeah, "G."

38:49.661 --> 38:51.078
A, B, C, D, E, F, G?

38:51.079 --> 38:53.381
"G." Half Of "G."

38:55.124 --> 38:56.959
- That's good, Ray.
- Yeah.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.307
- I like that.
- Yeah.

39:02.090 --> 39:02.812
We hungry?

39:02.813 --> 39:04.992
- Yeah, Tuesday we have pancakes.
- Pancakes.

39:04.993 --> 39:07.254
- That sounds good. We'll get some pancakes.
- Yeah, with maple syrup.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.905
- Hey, bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.057
Uh-oh.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.685
- They got pancakes.
- Uh-oh.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.894
What is this, Ray?

39:15.895 --> 39:17.980
Course, I don't have
my tooth picks.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.399
No, you don't need toothpicks.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.192
That was okay in the hotel
last night with the pizza,

39:22.193 --> 39:23.735
but in a restaurant,
you eat with a fork.

39:23.736 --> 39:24.862
Course, I don't have
my tooth picks.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.363
You don't need toothpicks, Ray.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.615
Pancakes keep sliding off.
You're gonna eat with a fork.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.992
I don't have my maple
syrup, either.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.286
I'm gonna be without my maple
syrup and my toothpicks.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.538
You don't see any
pancakes, do you, Ray?

39:34.539 --> 39:36.818
Course, your promised
maple syrup is not here.

39:36.819 --> 39:40.751
Ray? When we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.797
Maple syrup is supposed to be on
the table before the pancakes.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.132
We haven't ordered yet, Ray.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.884
Course, when they bring the
maple syrup after the pancakes,

39:46.885 --> 39:48.927
it'll definitely be too late.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.013
How is that gonna be
too late? Huh, Ray?

39:51.014 --> 39:52.806
We haven't ordered the pancakes
yet. How is that gonna be...

39:52.807 --> 39:54.641
We're gonna be here
the entire morning

39:54.642 --> 39:57.144
with no maple syrup
and no toothpicks,

39:57.145 --> 40:00.522
I'm definitely, definitely not
gonna have my pancakes with...

40:00.523 --> 40:01.899
- Ow!
- Ray.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.525
- Don't make a scene.
- Ow!

40:03.526 --> 40:05.360
Stop acting like a fuckin' retard.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.538
Uh-oh.

40:28.676 --> 40:31.069
What is this, what are you writing?

40:31.137 --> 40:33.939
What the fuck is this?

40:34.766 --> 40:36.892
"Serious... Serious injury list"?

40:36.893 --> 40:38.852
"Charlie Babbitt.
Serious injury list"?

40:38.853 --> 40:41.313
What, are you fuckin' kidding me?

40:41.314 --> 40:45.484
"Number 18 in 1988.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.195
"Squeezed and pulled and
hurt my neck in 1988."

40:48.196 --> 40:51.875
Squeezed and pulled and
hurt your neck in 1988?

40:53.868 --> 40:57.079
- Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.
<i>- Where are you, son?</i>

40:57.080 --> 40:59.539
It's not important. What
matters is who I'm with.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.250
<i>You have to bring him back, Mr.
Babbitt. Do you understand me?</i>

41:02.251 --> 41:05.379
No problem whatsoever.
That'll be $1.5 million.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.755
- I'm not greedy, I just want my half.
- Uh-oh.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.340
Raymond, don't touch
that. That's dirty.

41:08.341 --> 41:11.343
<i>I can't do that, Mr.
Babbitt. You know I can't.</i>

41:11.344 --> 41:13.971
<i>Just bring him back, and
bring him back now.</i>

41:13.972 --> 41:15.055
<i>This is where he belongs.</i>

41:15.056 --> 41:18.642
I'm his brother. It's not
like kidnapping, is it?

41:18.643 --> 41:20.185
<i>He's always been a
voluntary patient here,</i>

41:20.186 --> 41:22.229
<i>but that's beside the point.</i>

41:22.230 --> 41:24.898
<i>The fact of the matter is, this is
where he can get the best care.</i>

41:24.899 --> 41:27.275
<i>We're talking about his well-being.</i>

41:27.276 --> 41:29.653
Yeah, let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

41:29.654 --> 41:31.905
Now, I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

41:31.906 --> 41:35.075
If you don't want to cut a deal with
me, I'll fly him back to Los Angeles,

41:35.076 --> 41:36.910
stick him in an
institution out there,

41:36.911 --> 41:40.247
and we can have a custody
battle over him.

41:40.248 --> 41:42.416
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.710
Could you help him, get him some
toothpicks? Thank you very much.

41:44.711 --> 41:46.628
You want to battle
me in the courts?

41:46.629 --> 41:48.338
Think about that,

41:48.339 --> 41:50.132
Dr. Bruner, think about that.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.009
Or we can cut a deal right now.

41:52.010 --> 41:55.303
<i>I don't think you have any idea of
the severity of Raymond's condition.</i>

41:55.304 --> 41:57.935
Toothpicks. He needs some
toothpicks. Can we just get him...

41:57.936 --> 41:59.683
- some toothpicks over here?
- Yeah.

41:59.684 --> 42:03.228
<i>And I cannot, under any circumstances,
make any money deals with you.</i>

42:03.229 --> 42:05.872
Then I'll see you in court.

42:09.986 --> 42:12.946
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.615
82, 82, 82.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.242
82 what, Ray?

42:17.243 --> 42:19.841
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

42:21.831 --> 42:23.915
It's a lot more than
82 toothpicks, Ray.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.626
Course, 246 total.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.599
Keep the change.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.840
Ray. How many
toothpicks are in there?

42:31.841 --> 42:33.050
250.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.469
Pretty close. Come on.
Let's go, Ray.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.943
246.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.599
There's four left in the box.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.977
Course, I have to get my backpack.

42:43.978 --> 42:46.246
Forgot my backpack.

42:46.606 --> 42:52.708
<i>97X. The future of rock and roll.</i>

42:53.112 --> 42:59.089
97X. Bam. The future

43:01.079 --> 43:07.181
97X. Bam. The future

43:08.169 --> 43:13.632
97X. Bam. The future
of rock and roll.

43:13.633 --> 43:14.716
Ray. Ray.

43:14.717 --> 43:17.052
Enough already. Change the channel.

43:17.053 --> 43:21.778
97X. Bam. The future
of rock and roll.

43:22.934 --> 43:28.021
97X. Bam. The future
of rock and roll.

43:28.022 --> 43:31.399
Lenny, I don't care what you
think. Did they say that?

43:31.400 --> 43:33.193
You're gonna have to be a lot
more forceful with them.

43:33.194 --> 43:34.528
Lenny, are you... Lenny, listen.

43:34.529 --> 43:36.238
Lenny, Lenny, shut
up a moment here.

43:36.239 --> 43:39.950
I am in serious trouble here. I can't get
to these cars. I can't get the money.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.702
Do you understand that?
My loan is past due.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.037
<i>Look, I'll call the loan office...</i>

43:44.038 --> 43:45.205
Lenny...

43:45.206 --> 43:47.007
<i>...tell them we have
a little problem.</i>

43:47.375 --> 43:48.542
<i>Charlie, let me talk...</i>

43:48.543 --> 43:52.587
Lenny, just listen to me. I'll
be in LAX in three hours, okay?

43:52.588 --> 43:57.676
Now, remember the Buick is in A3, main
terminal. Make sure they pick it up.

43:57.677 --> 44:00.650
All right, well, right.
We'll see you in a few.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.538
Raymond, let's go. Raymond.

44:14.569 --> 44:18.168
Ray! Ray, let's go. Come on.

44:19.615 --> 44:22.409
- What are you watching, Ray?
- I don't know.

44:22.410 --> 44:23.743
You don't know?

44:23.744 --> 44:27.247
<i>Final call for Flight 1569,</i>

44:27.248 --> 44:31.052
<i>service to Salt Lake
City and Los Angeles.</i>

44:31.711 --> 44:32.919
Uh-oh.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.130
Uh-oh. Course, there's
an airplane out there.

44:35.131 --> 44:36.882
Yeah, that's right, and
everybody's boarding. Let's go.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.425
Airline travel's very dangerous.

44:38.426 --> 44:40.260
Don't be silly. It's the
safest travel in the world.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.429
- You're gonna love this. Trust me.
- Yeah.

44:42.430 --> 44:44.973
- Now, come on.
- Oh, no.

44:44.974 --> 44:46.308
- Ray.
- Yeah.

44:46.309 --> 44:48.602
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.270
What did you think we were
doing here this whole time?

44:50.271 --> 44:53.273
Flying's very dangerous. 1987,
there were 30 airline accidents.

44:53.274 --> 44:56.526
211 were fatalities, 231
were definitely passengers.

44:56.527 --> 44:58.320
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

44:58.321 --> 45:00.697
I gotta get to L.A. I don't have
time for this shit. Come on.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.617
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Ray, Ray...

45:03.618 --> 45:05.202
- You don't know?
- No.

45:05.203 --> 45:06.786
- What is it? This airline?
- Yeah.

45:06.787 --> 45:07.913
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.

45:07.914 --> 45:10.457
Okay, fine. We can...

45:10.458 --> 45:12.500
There's an American plane...

45:12.501 --> 45:17.272
American Flight 625
crashed April 27, 1976.

45:17.423 --> 45:19.466
We don't have to take American,
there's a lot of flights.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.009
Yeah. Pick another airline.

45:21.010 --> 45:22.302
Continental.

45:22.303 --> 45:25.263
Continental crashed
November 15, 1987.

45:25.264 --> 45:28.738
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.852
- This is very serious, Ray.
- Very serious.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.646
You see, I have to
get to Los Angeles.

45:32.647 --> 45:35.607
All right? So you're gonna get on
that plane, do you understand me?

45:35.608 --> 45:37.484
- Yeah.
- You're gonna have to get on a plane.

45:37.485 --> 45:39.945
Yeah, get on a plane.

45:39.946 --> 45:43.198
Now, there's a Delta.

45:43.199 --> 45:46.076
It leaves at midnight,
Ray, but how's Delta?

45:46.077 --> 45:49.537
Delta crashed August 2,
1985. Lockheed L-1011.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.830
- Dallas/Fort Worth.
- All right, Ray.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.791
- Terrible wind shear. 135 passengers.
- All airlines!

45:52.792 --> 45:56.336
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

45:56.337 --> 45:57.837
That doesn't mean that
they are not safe.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.965
- Qantas.
- Qantas?

45:59.966 --> 46:02.592
Qantas never crashed.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.316
- Qantas?
- Never crashed.

46:06.472 --> 46:09.891
Well, that's... That's going
to do me a lot of good, Ray.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.352
You see, Qantas doesn't fly
to L.A. out of Cincinnati.

46:12.353 --> 46:14.104
- You have gotta get to Melbourne.
- Australia.

46:14.105 --> 46:17.274
Melbourne, Australia in order to get
the plane that flies to Los Angeles!

46:17.275 --> 46:19.268
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

46:19.269 --> 46:22.487
16.2 million population.
Very lovely beaches.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.367
You and I are gonna get
on this fucking plane!

46:24.368 --> 46:25.912
No.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.417
Ray, Ray, Ray!

46:35.418 --> 46:37.877
We're not going to take the plane.
He's okay, he's okay!

46:37.878 --> 46:40.547
He's okay. We're not
going to take the plane.

46:40.548 --> 46:41.881
Ray. Ray, just...

46:41.882 --> 46:43.550
Just relax. He was...

46:43.551 --> 46:44.968
He was upset. We were
gonna take the plane.

46:44.969 --> 46:47.178
We're not gonna take the plane now.
We're not gonna take the plane.

46:47.179 --> 46:50.573
- We're not gonna fly, okay?
- No flying.

46:52.977 --> 46:56.354
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.356
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

46:58.357 --> 47:01.568
We're going to drive to Los Angeles.
We're gonna drive to L.A.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.528
Okay? Come on, Ray.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.739
- Ray, come on.
- Yeah.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.115
- Come on. Here.
- No flying.

47:07.116 --> 47:10.118
Take the bag. We're not gonna take the
plane, Ray. Just grab the fucking bag, man.

47:10.119 --> 47:12.216
No flying.

47:12.913 --> 47:15.832
You're killing me, Ray. I just want
you to know you are killing me, man.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.709
- No flying.
- I got to be in L.A. in three hours,

47:17.710 --> 47:19.878
it's gonna take me three days.

47:19.879 --> 47:22.773
Come on. Come on.

47:24.216 --> 47:25.592
No flying.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.395
- No flying.
- No flying.

47:29.638 --> 47:32.557
Course, I got <i>Jeopardy!</i> at 5:00.

47:32.558 --> 47:33.767
I watch <i>Jeopardy!</i> at 5:00.

47:33.768 --> 47:37.572
- Don't start with that.
- I've got <i>Jeopardy!</i> at 5:00.

48:10.805 --> 48:13.681
<i>- Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.
- Go ahead, 1-0-9.</i>

48:13.682 --> 48:16.601
<i>See if you can get another unit
up here for point control.</i>

48:16.602 --> 48:19.780
<i>Two more over to you. 10-40.</i>

48:20.856 --> 48:23.408
Come on. Let's go!

48:25.152 --> 48:27.737
- Bring some more up.
<i>- What's your E.T.A.?</i>

48:27.738 --> 48:29.539
Uh-oh.

48:30.199 --> 48:32.000
Ray.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.632
- Ray, get in the car.
- Driving is dangerous.

48:34.870 --> 48:37.914
Just get in the car.
Are you crazy? Huh?

48:37.915 --> 48:39.416
We'll be outta this in a second.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.000
- Yeah.
- That's good.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.253
It's okay. That's right.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.338
Yeah. We'll be outta here in
a few seconds. That's good.

48:45.339 --> 48:47.006
That's good. That's good.

48:47.007 --> 48:50.260
There's definitely a fatal
accident over there.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.469
Ray. Ray.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.870
Hey! We don't need your help
up here. Go on back to your car.

48:55.349 --> 48:57.150
Just a minute!

48:57.476 --> 48:59.949
Ray. Ray. Ray.

49:00.688 --> 49:01.855
Ray.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.024
Excuse... Hey!

49:05.025 --> 49:07.193
- Just wait...
- There's nothing to see here.

49:07.194 --> 49:08.528
Go back and get in your car.

49:08.529 --> 49:09.696
Yes, sir.

49:09.697 --> 49:11.906
- Wrecks just make him nervous.
- Fine. Go back and get in your car.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.701
Yes, sir. Just stay there by
the side, okay, Raymond?

49:14.702 --> 49:16.703
- Ray! Listen, Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

49:16.704 --> 49:19.882
Yeah. Definitely a lot of traffic.

49:19.915 --> 49:22.125
Hell of a lot of
work for $3 million.

49:22.126 --> 49:24.926
Just leave him on the goddamn highway
and just get the hell outta here.

49:26.005 --> 49:28.307
Yeah. What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

49:33.554 --> 49:35.571
Stay in your car!

49:42.396 --> 49:44.063
What's it gonna be, Ray?
What's it gonna be?

49:44.064 --> 49:46.232
This is a very dangerous highway.

49:46.233 --> 49:47.734
How am I gonna get to L.A.?

49:47.735 --> 49:50.153
Course, driving a car on this
interstate is very dangerous.

49:50.154 --> 49:52.447
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

49:52.448 --> 49:54.449
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Well, you gotta get in the car

49:54.450 --> 49:55.617
in order to get off the highway!

49:55.618 --> 49:59.968
Course, in 1986, 46,400 male drivers were
definitely involved in fatal accidents.

50:02.791 --> 50:05.126
All right, I got an idea.
I got a great idea.

50:05.127 --> 50:07.670
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.

50:07.671 --> 50:09.964
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

50:09.965 --> 50:11.716
Whatever that might be.

50:11.717 --> 50:13.092
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

50:13.093 --> 50:15.053
Come on. Give me five,
Ray. That's a great idea.

50:15.054 --> 50:16.596
- Yeah.
- Give me five. Yeah. Yeah.

50:16.597 --> 50:19.070
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

50:26.690 --> 50:29.275
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.

50:29.276 --> 50:31.861
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

50:31.862 --> 50:34.948
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

50:34.949 --> 50:36.658
Who is on first.

50:36.659 --> 50:39.118
Whose wife? Yes.

50:39.119 --> 50:41.246
After all, the man
earns it. Who does?

50:41.247 --> 50:42.288
Absolutely.

50:42.289 --> 50:45.041
All I'm tryin' to find out is what
the guy's name on first base.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.918
No. What is on second base.

50:46.919 --> 50:49.963
I'm not asking you who's on
second base. Who's on first?

50:49.964 --> 50:51.297
That's what I'm tryin' to find out.

50:51.298 --> 50:52.423
Get the hell in the car!

50:52.424 --> 50:54.551
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.052
Get in the car.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.720
Course, I have to
be in bed by 11:00.

50:57.721 --> 51:00.774
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

51:05.980 --> 51:08.189
Course, now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

51:08.190 --> 51:10.024
I have to be in bed
at 11:00. Lights out.

51:10.025 --> 51:12.485
Don't start with this. We're not flying.
We're not on the interstate.

51:12.486 --> 51:15.446
I'm on some shit secondary road.
I gotta make up some time.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.489
I gotta get to Los Angeles.

51:16.490 --> 51:18.700
I should have been there this
afternoon. My business needs me.

51:18.701 --> 51:20.326
I gotta make up some time.

51:20.327 --> 51:21.369
Definitely watch TV,

51:21.370 --> 51:23.621
but you have to be in
bed at 11:00. Lights out.

51:23.622 --> 51:24.706
Forget it.

51:24.707 --> 51:27.475
Uh-oh, 19 minutes to 11:00.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.307
This is a good one.

51:42.308 --> 51:43.641
"We don't go out when it rains."

51:43.642 --> 51:46.019
This is a real good one, Ray.
I hope you appreciate this,

51:46.020 --> 51:48.688
because my business is going
down the fuckin' toilet.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.356
I should be in L.A.

51:50.357 --> 51:54.319
Instead, I'm in the Honeymoon Haven
Motel in Bumblefuck, Missouri,

51:54.320 --> 51:56.738
because you won't go
out when it rains.

51:56.739 --> 51:59.866
It's mystifying. I mean,
it's fucking mystifying.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.871
What is this?

52:04.872 --> 52:07.015
Good news, bad news?

52:07.041 --> 52:08.875
We passed DOT, but failed EPA.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.336
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

52:11.337 --> 52:14.672
Yes, sir, I'm just stuck in
Cincinnati since the funeral.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.132
So many leftover details.

52:16.133 --> 52:18.509
My family is, needless to say,

52:18.510 --> 52:20.219
quite overwhelmed.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.555
Thank you. I appreciate it.

52:22.556 --> 52:25.391
Well, it is a shock,
to say the least.

52:25.392 --> 52:28.436
Thank you. Is there any way I can
get an extension on that loan?

52:28.437 --> 52:30.396
Just a couple of days.

52:30.397 --> 52:32.190
It would make a world
of difference.

52:39.239 --> 52:41.211
"We don't go out
when it's raining."

52:46.246 --> 52:47.914
What? Speak up, Lenny.

52:47.915 --> 52:49.749
Lenny, I bought time,
I didn't buy that kind of time.

52:49.750 --> 52:52.085
What I want you to do is you're
gonna have to... How much?

52:52.086 --> 52:53.544
- Course, it's 12:30.
- What?

52:53.545 --> 52:54.879
Lunch is 12:30.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.715
- Hold on. What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

52:57.716 --> 53:00.314
- Fish sticks?
- Green lime JELL-O for dessert.

53:00.427 --> 53:02.261
Green lime JELL-O.
Want another apple juice?

53:02.262 --> 53:05.598
I want orange soda. Oh, it's 12:31.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.016
I gotta go. He's starting
to rock and moan.

53:07.017 --> 53:10.019
- Yeah, it's definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.739
Course, there's four fish sticks.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.282
There's supposed to
be eight fish sticks.

53:23.283 --> 53:25.910
Eight? There's eight.

53:25.911 --> 53:28.955
You take a shower, Ray? Hmm? Ray?

53:28.956 --> 53:30.707
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

53:30.708 --> 53:31.791
- Right?
- Yeah.

53:31.792 --> 53:34.094
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

53:34.336 --> 53:36.963
What do you say, Ray?
What do you say? Huh?

53:36.964 --> 53:39.107
Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

53:40.592 --> 53:42.393
That's the end of
that conversation.

53:42.761 --> 53:44.470
<i>- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200, please.</i>

53:44.471 --> 53:46.222
<i>The answer at the top
of the category.</i>

53:46.223 --> 53:49.809
<i>"Shakespeare wrote over 150
poems in this 14-line form."</i>

53:49.810 --> 53:51.769
- What is a sonnet?
<i>- What is a sonnet?</i>

53:51.770 --> 53:54.230
<i>- You got it.
- Let's try Double Letters for 200.</i>

53:54.231 --> 53:55.440
<i>The top of that one.</i>

53:55.441 --> 53:58.317
<i>"The last word in the
Pledge of Allegiance." Mark.</i>

53:58.318 --> 53:59.610
<i>- What is "stands"?
- No.</i>

53:59.611 --> 54:06.089
Stu, legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

54:07.077 --> 54:10.288
He didn't figure anyone would
show up to contest his authority.

54:10.289 --> 54:13.416
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody

54:13.417 --> 54:15.376
- and the $3 million, right?
<i>- Possibly.</i>

54:15.377 --> 54:19.839
Then you set up a date
for the custody hearing.

54:19.840 --> 54:23.009
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

54:23.010 --> 54:24.719
<i>I found that it was
an original record,</i>

54:24.720 --> 54:27.138
<i>because the original
song had two verses...</i>

54:27.139 --> 54:30.567
Lenny, she hasn't come
in, she hasn't called?

54:31.059 --> 54:32.351
If you see her or hear from her,

54:32.352 --> 54:34.574
tell her to call me at this number.

54:46.241 --> 54:49.590
<i>The Air Alpha Force, from Nike.</i>

54:51.705 --> 54:55.416
Would you look at that? 1957
Studebaker Golden Hawk.

54:55.417 --> 54:57.126
Zero to 60 in under eight seconds.

54:57.127 --> 55:00.338
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

55:00.339 --> 55:02.381
- That's beautiful.
- Course, I'm an excellent driver.

55:02.382 --> 55:04.684
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

55:05.469 --> 55:06.552
When did you drive?

55:06.553 --> 55:07.845
Course, I drove the
Buick on the driveway

55:07.846 --> 55:10.364
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

55:11.225 --> 55:13.559
Was Dad in the car?
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

55:13.560 --> 55:15.361
Yeah.

55:16.688 --> 55:17.897
And he let you drive the Buick?

55:17.898 --> 55:20.291
Yeah, slow on the driveway.

55:21.568 --> 55:23.861
I'll have to let you
drive sometime.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.280
Raymond! Raymond! Raymond!

55:26.281 --> 55:28.741
You never, never touch the
steering wheel when I'm driving!

55:28.742 --> 55:30.701
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

55:30.702 --> 55:33.095
Course, I don't have my underwear.

55:33.205 --> 55:35.748
- What?
- I'm definitely not wearing my underwear.

55:35.749 --> 55:36.874
What are you talking about?

55:36.875 --> 55:37.917
I gave you a fresh pair
of mine this morning.

55:37.918 --> 55:40.015
Not my underwear.

55:40.087 --> 55:42.630
I told you to go in the bathroom
and put them on. Where are they?

55:42.631 --> 55:44.924
Course, they're in the
pocket of my jacket.

55:44.925 --> 55:47.022
- Where?
- Here.

55:47.636 --> 55:49.011
These are too tight.

55:49.012 --> 55:50.638
- I don't want them back, Ray.
- These are not boxer shorts.

55:50.639 --> 55:51.764
Mine are boxer shorts.

55:51.765 --> 55:55.184
- What's the difference?
- These are Hanes 32.

55:55.185 --> 55:56.602
My boxer shorts have my name.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.271
- It says "Raymond."
- All right.

55:58.272 --> 56:00.523
When we pass a store, we'll pick
you up a pair of boxer shorts.

56:00.524 --> 56:03.359
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.736
We're not going back to Cincinnati,
Ray, so don't even start with that.

56:05.737 --> 56:06.863
400 Oak Street.

56:06.864 --> 56:07.947
You're not going
back to Cincinnati.

56:07.948 --> 56:10.157
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to pick up boxer shorts.

56:10.158 --> 56:12.285
- It's Oak and Burnett, in Cincinnati.
- What did I say, Ray?

56:12.286 --> 56:13.411
It's Kmart.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.872
You hear me. I know you hear me.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.291
You don't fool me with
this shit for a second.

56:18.292 --> 56:19.458
Yours are too tight.

56:19.459 --> 56:21.961
Ray, did you fuckin'
hear what I said?

56:21.962 --> 56:24.764
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

56:26.466 --> 56:29.135
Cincinnati's a long way off.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.721
We're getting further
away from Kmart.

56:31.722 --> 56:34.140
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get a pair of underwear at Kmart.

56:34.141 --> 56:36.309
You have to go to Kmart.
400 Oak Street.

56:36.310 --> 56:38.811
What'd I tell you, Ray? We're not
going to Cincinnati. That's final.

56:38.812 --> 56:39.896
I get my boxer shorts at Kmart.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.606
Raymond, that is final!
Do you hear me?

56:41.607 --> 56:43.624
I'm gonna be short-less.

56:51.909 --> 56:53.200
What difference does it make...

56:53.201 --> 56:56.287
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

56:56.288 --> 56:57.538
What difference does it make?

56:57.539 --> 56:59.665
Underwear is underwear!

56:59.666 --> 57:01.751
It is underwear
wherever you buy it!

57:01.752 --> 57:04.128
In Cincinnati or wherever!

57:04.129 --> 57:05.212
Kmart.

57:05.213 --> 57:07.590
- You know what I think, Ray?
- Kmart.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.842
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit!

57:09.843 --> 57:12.929
'Cause you can't tell me
you're not in there somewhere!

57:12.930 --> 57:15.181
Boxer shorts.

57:15.182 --> 57:17.859
Boxer shorts at Kmart.

57:18.018 --> 57:21.062
These are... These are Hanes 32.

57:21.063 --> 57:23.397
- You're driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

57:23.398 --> 57:26.067
We're gonna have to make a little
stop and find a psychiatrist.

57:26.068 --> 57:27.526
You're driving me crazy.

57:27.527 --> 57:29.362
Oak and Burnett, that's
where the shorts are.

57:29.363 --> 57:30.613
'Cause you are driving me crazy.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.198
We have to buy them at
Kmart, Oak and Burnett.

57:32.199 --> 57:34.951
We have to buy them
back in... Uh-oh.

57:34.952 --> 57:37.370
Course, your shorts
are on the highway.

57:37.371 --> 57:40.344
Let's go back to Cincinnati. Kmart.

58:05.440 --> 58:08.538
Good luck trying to find
a shrink in this town.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.150
Raymond?

59:23.351 --> 59:26.312
Hey, you. Hey, dipshit, move it!

59:29.399 --> 59:31.525
If you ain't gonna
move, I'll move you.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.486
Hey, buddy. Hey, you!

59:33.487 --> 59:35.821
- You're gonna get run over out here.
- Hey! Hey!

59:35.822 --> 59:37.782
- You're gonna get hurt. Come on.
- It said, "Don't walk."

59:37.783 --> 59:40.451
- Hey! Do you hear me?
- Yeah. It said, "Don't walk."

59:40.452 --> 59:41.619
Move it. Move it.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.954
Hey, it's all right, sir.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.998
I'm sorry. He's from
out of town. Raymond?

59:45.999 --> 59:47.666
- Come on.
- Yeah.

59:47.667 --> 59:50.002
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

59:50.003 --> 59:52.505
Raymond, Raymond, come on.

59:52.506 --> 59:54.173
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

59:54.174 --> 59:55.508
It said, "Don't walk."

59:55.509 --> 59:56.592
Yes, it's broken.

59:56.593 --> 59:58.394
It said, "Don't walk."

59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.222
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.474
400 Oak and Burnett.

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:05.276
Oak and Burnett.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.814
He said, "Young man, go west,"

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:12.191
and this is the way
our country developed

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:15.027
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:21.050
During that period of
time there was initiated

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.912
what was known as the Pony Express.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.872
I'm sure all of you have
read something about it

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:28.666
in the history of
the United States.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.502
I may not have the days
exactly right or the years,

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:36.399
but I'm more or less familiar with
the history of the United States.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:39.176
He's "artistic"?

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:41.053
No, he's autistic.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.389
I'm not familiar with that.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.641
What is the exact
nature of the problem?

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.862
He lives in a world of his own.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:54.024
I'm sorry, but what's
wrong with him?

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:56.277
It was a problem gettin'
mail from the East Coast...

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:58.529
Raymond, do a little of your
"What's On First?" for her.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.531
Who's on first. What's on second.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.333
Huh?

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:07.121
They set up an initial program

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.248
where the Pony Express

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:13.428
would ride for
approximately 20 miles...

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.422
What am I supposed to do?

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:19.225
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:20.926
I'm not a psychiatrist,

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.762
but I do know that his brain
doesn't work like other people.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.931
What he does isn't
intended to be annoying.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:29.059
If he's getting on your nerves,
you just take a break.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.227
Spend time away from him.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:31.937
Sure, I'll just send him back.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:33.063
- Sorry?
- Nothing,

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.732
just kidding, it's an inside joke.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.859
You're telling me I just have to
deal with this stuff, is that it?

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.445
I just gotta deal with this stuff.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:41.793
Yeah, that's about it.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:46.169
Out of curiosity, does he
have any special abilities?

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:49.079
Well, he's got a
pretty good memory.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.373
He counts toothpicks.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.918
He spilled a box of
toothpicks on the floor.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.545
He took one look at them and he
knew exactly how many there were.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.689
He counted them in seconds.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.007
Ray?

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:01.467
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.344
Are you good with numbers?

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:04.803
Yeah.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:07.223
I read about this. I want
to try something here.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:08.557
Kmart. 400 Oak Street.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.726
What did I tell you? After
this, Raymond. After this.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.312
- Ray, can we try something?
- Yeah.

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:19.443
Do you know how much
312 times 123 is?

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.862
38,376.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.239
He's right.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.823
- What?
- He's right.

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:25.950
- He's right?
- Yeah.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:30.287
Ray, how much is 4,343

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:33.540
times 1,234?

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.793
5,359,262.

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:38.096
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:39.588
He's a genius.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:45.520
Ray, do you know how much the
square root of 2,130 is?

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:50.182
46.15192304.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:51.475
2304.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:52.935
That's amazing.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:56.865
That is amazing. He should work
for NASA or something like that.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.360
If you had a dollar, and
you spent 50 cents,

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.913
how much money would you have left?

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:08.993
About 70.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.577
- 70 cents?
- 70 cents.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.037
So much for the NASA idea.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:14.081
Kmart. We should go to Kmart.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.374
What'd I tell ya? After this, Ray.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.293
400 Oak Street.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:20.222
Ray, do you know how
much a candy bar costs?

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.672
About $100.

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:23.173
- $100, huh?
- Yeah.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:25.342
Do you know how much one of
those new compact cars cost?

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.520
About $100.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:32.057
In his particular case, he's pretty
well-off, he's very high-functioning.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.987
Most autistics, they can't speak
or they can't communicate.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:38.439
- Ray?
- Yeah.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.858
- Do you know what autistic is?
- Yeah.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.252
- You know that word?
- Yeah.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.831
Are you autistic?

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.168
I don't think so.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:54.180
No, definitely not.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.293
<i>...problem with the
Lamborghinis, Charlie.</i>

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.378
Just shut up a second. Let
me see if I understood this.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:02.463
Very small. Yeah.

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.757
It's gonna cost me $10,000
additional for each car.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.258
- Course, it's very crowded in here.
- Is that...

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:09.094
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.763
Huh? What?

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:13.057
They wanna take out the
manifold and the carburetors

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.184
in order to put in a fuel
injection system now?

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.560
I mean, that is nonsense.

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:17.936
<i>- I know that you're upset.</i>
- What are you doing?

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.606
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.
- Just leave this on.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:23.776
Yeah. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet EPA now.

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:25.778
What? No. No. No.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:29.698
You give me the number. I'm gonna
call the conversion shop myself.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.575
That's my pen. That's
definitely my book.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:33.786
Taking your book is
not a serious injury.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:36.080
For serious injury, look at the
red book. That book is blue.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:39.166
Forgive me. I've lost my
secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:41.794
- You're already number 18. In 1988.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.796
It's my book. That's my pen.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.923
Uh-oh. 12 minutes to Wapner.

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:47.800
It's definitely very small in here.

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.219
Small... and safe.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.345
You don't wanna miss the party.

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:52.554
What you're witnessing is real.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.198
Do you know that? There's a
party in your honor, Ray.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.769
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up right now.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:01.647
You know why there's a party for you?
Because you're the 3-million-dollar man.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.065
What you are witnessing is real.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.149
Ken Aldorf.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.651
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:06.985
Uh-oh. Fart.

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:08.404
Yeah, Charlie Babbitt. I'll hold.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.655
Uh-oh. Fart.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.365
- Did you fart, Raymond?
- Fart.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.383
- Did you fuckin' fart?
- Fart.

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:16.299
Oh, man. Get the smell out.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.747
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.124
How can you stand that?

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:21.834
- Yeah, Ken.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.627
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:25.254
We're definitely locked
in this box with no TV.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.464
I just heard about this
$10,000 charge for every car.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:30.384
- They're definitely gonna start...
- How can this be?

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:33.011
- How can this possibly happen right now?
<i>- The People's Court</i> starts...

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.805
- I don't know.
- You're telling me another $40,000.

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.558
They start on the button. They
definitely start on the button.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:40.310
I've got a problem. I'm gonna have
to call you back from my next stop.

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:43.272
- We're not gonna make it to the program.
- Okay, my next stop.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.357
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:48.152
- Just take it easy. Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:50.529
Where am I gonna find a
television around here?

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.833
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.184
Come on. Come on.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:16.763
You wanna get in there and see
the show? Huh? Huh, Raymond?

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:18.724
Wanna get in there and see
the show? Then listen up.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:22.369
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it, man.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.648
You act weird, we don't get in.
You listening to me?

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:27.858
Yeah.

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.986
I want you to look normal. As
normal as possible, all right?

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.739
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.033
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.868
Yeah. Uh...

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:41.548
Raymond, don't rock and moan.
Put your hands down.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:47.769
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:49.755
You're familiar with our work?

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.965
Nielsen... I... You
mean the TV ratings?

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:54.760
Yes, ma'am. That's exactly it. You've
been selected as a preliminary candidate

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:58.096
to become our next Nielsen
family in the tri-county area.

01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.619
- My husband's not home.
- If selected...

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.985
you'll share the responsibility for
shaping television programming

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:04.845
viewed by our entire nation

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:09.775
in return for which you'll receive a
check in the amount of $286 each month.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.235
Who's he?

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:16.758
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample...

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.245
- Oh, boy.
- That's it.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.664
You blew it. You don't
get to see your program.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:25.290
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:28.001
One minute to Wapner. One minute
to Wapner. One minute to Wapner.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:30.045
I had you in there, Ray!
You were in there.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.632
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:36.176
- Uh-oh.
- They're in there making legal history, Ray.

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.470
- Legal history.
- Oh! Oh, boy!

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:39.638
Oh, boy.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.056
What is going on out here?

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.766
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
- It's gonna be on.

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:45.477
I am very sorry about that. That
man right there is my brother.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:47.896
If he doesn't watch <i>People's
Court</i> in about 30 seconds

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.648
he's gonna throw a fit
right here on your porch.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:52.918
Now, you can help me, or you can
stand there and watch it happen.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:57.126
We like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:00.626
<i>...and she sees an identical twin.</i>

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:03.829
<i>True, he didn't have his
shirt on, the other one did,</i>

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.456
<i>but they sure look alike to me.</i>

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:10.502
<i>If it got on his chest, even if
it didn't burn or got real cold</i>

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:13.171
<i>- I put my hand on the dry ice.</i>
- Daddy's not here now.

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:17.091
<i>I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.</i>

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.178
<i>I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.</i>

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.139
<i>If I take it and put it up
against a bare chest...</i>

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.392
Gary, work with me on this one. Believe
me, I'm gonna take care of you.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:31.323
- You know that song?
<i>- My judgment is for the...</i>

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.653
<i>We'll be back for the
audience reaction</i>

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:40.549
<i>to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.</i>

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:47.872
<i>The head bone connected
from the neck bone</i>

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:51.542
<i>The neck bone connected
from the shoulder bone</i>

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:54.880
<i>The shoulder bone connected
from the back bone</i>

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:58.508
<i>The back bone connected
from the hip bone</i>

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:02.220
<i>The hip bone connected
from the thigh bone</i>

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.515
<i>Thigh bone connected
from the knee bone</i>

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:08.977
<i>The knee bone connected
from the leg bone</i>

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:12.814
<i>The leg bone connected
from the ankle bone</i>

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:16.915
<i>The ankle bone connected
from the heel bone</i>

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:19.872
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:19.872 --> 01:09:21.098
Must be some accounting error.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.241
- How much is this gonna cost?
- $20, sir.

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:25.202
<i>Hear the word of the Lord</i>

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.578
<i>Oh, dem bones, dem bones</i>

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.872
Thank you.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:35.837
<i>Dem bones, dem bones</i>

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:39.858
<i>Now hear the word of the Lord</i>

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:57.243
<i>Hear the word of the Lord</i>

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:09.996
Course, I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a long time.

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:12.290
It's definitely going
to be a long journey.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.875
Just a couple of more days, Ray.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:16.628
Yeah... You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.714
You mean the fellow playing
first base for St. Louis?

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.716
We're gonna start with this again,
Ray? It's just another motel.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.759
You gotta do this every time?

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.970
That's the man's name.
That's whose name?

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.597
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:29.057
Who's on first.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.726
I'm asking you who's on first.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.352
Yo, Ray.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:34.646
Ray, this is not...
It's not a riddle.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:37.498
Yeah. You know the fellow's name?
Then who's playing first?

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:41.528
You're never gonna figure out who's on
first base, because Who is on first base.

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.196
That's a joke, Ray. It's comedy.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.782
Sometimes his wife comes down
and collects it. Whose wife?

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:48.631
- It's comedy, man.
- Every dollar of it.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.787
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:52.497
It's a routine between
Abbott and Costello.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:53.957
When you do it, you're not funny.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.501
You're the comedy team
of Abbott and Abbott.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:57.836
You understand what I'm saying?

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.337
Sometimes his wife comes
down and collects it.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:00.714
Whose wife? Yeah.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:04.885
Ray, you are never
going to solve it.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:08.180
You know why you're never gonna
solve it? 'Cause it's not a riddle, man.

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:11.683
If you understood that, if you
understood that it's funny,

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.101
you might get better.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:16.438
All I'm trying to find out is,
what's the guy's name on first base?

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.106
What's the guy's
name on first base?

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.858
No. What's the guy's
name on second base.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:22.110
Have you got a first
baseman on first? Yeah.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.538
Then who's playing first? Yeah.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.365
Who's... You know the
fellow's name? Yeah.

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:28.617
Then who's playing first?

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:30.994
The fella playing for St. Louis?

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.662
Who. The guy on first.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:34.206
The first baseman. Who's on first.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:35.832
What are you asking me for?

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.876
Have you got a first
baseman on first? Yeah.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.377
All right, Ray. Come on.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:42.297
We're gonna put the bed by
the window the way you like.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.840
We got your apple juice.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:48.011
We're gonna take the pens and paper out,
we're gonna put 'em on the table...

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.221
What's the matter, Ray,
did I forget something?

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:50.347
Cheese balls.

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.308
- Yes, I forgot the cheese balls.
- Definitely have cheese balls.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.518
But we got them.

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.686
I have to have 12 cheese balls.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:58.104
I have to get my tartar
control toothpaste.

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:00.232
We got that. I got that for
you a couple of days ago.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.501
Where's my tartar
control toothpaste?

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.788
Raymond.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.366
Raymond, remember when that doctor
asked you those questions today?

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.493
- The number questions?
- Yeah.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:13.036
How did you do that?

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.579
- I see it.
- Huh?

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.206
I see it.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:17.374
What's that?

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:20.168
- Will you stop that for a second?
- I see it.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.503
Just put that down, will you?

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:22.754
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.673
When I say stop it, why
don't you stop it?

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:27.568
Why do you always have
to act like an idiot?

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.428
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.430
Funny Rain Man. Funny teeth.

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:33.598
What did you say?

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.867
- Funny teeth.
- Rinse.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.075
Why did you say...

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:44.609
Why did you say funny teeth?

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:47.412
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.781
Rain Man? I said Rain Man?

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:52.084
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.747
Was I trying to say Raymond,
and it came out Rain Man?

01:12:57.748 --> 01:13:00.346
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.638
You? You're the Rain Man?

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:20.186
Who took this picture?

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:22.159
D-A-D.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.815
And you lived with us?

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:28.086
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.739
When... When did you leave?

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.383
January 21, 1965.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:35.035
- You remember that?
- It was Thursday.

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:36.369
Very snowy out.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:40.219
7.2 inches of snow that day.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.792
That's just after mom
died, New Year's.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:45.921
Mom died January 5, 1965.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:48.048
And you remember that day? You
remember that day that you left?

01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:49.633
After short and sudden illness.

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:52.636
- You remember that day you left?
- Yeah.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.846
Was I there? Where was I?

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:57.015
You were in the window.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.850
You waved to me.
"Bye-bye, Rain Man."

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.653
"Bye-bye, Rain Man."

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:06.399
So you were the one
that sang to me?

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.452
Yeah.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:12.447
What did you sing?

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:15.000
What was that song?

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:17.173
What did you sing?

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:21.831
<i>Well, she was just 17</i>

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:25.168
<i>And you know what I mean</i>

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:30.600
<i>And the way she looked
was way beyond compare</i>

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:36.638
<i>So how could I dance with another</i>

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:43.196
<i>When I saw her standing there?</i>

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.235
Did I like it when you sang to me?

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:52.162
Yeah.

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:55.907
Did we sing any other songs?
You like The Beatles?

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.033
Yeah.

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:02.455
Scary! Scary bad!

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.290
Scary bad!

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.709
It's scary!

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.339
- Scary bad!
- What's scary bad?

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.008
What's scary bad?

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.277
Hot water burn baby!

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:16.511
Water!

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.929
"Hot water burn baby"?

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:21.099
- What baby? Me? Me?
- Yeah.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.851
Easy. Easy. Ray, Ray.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.145
Hot water burn baby.

01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:27.480
I'm not burned. Look at me. Please.

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:28.690
- Hot water burn baby!
- Ray, please. Please!

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.608
Please! I'm not burned.

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.652
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:35.155
- I'm not burned, man.
- Tub burn baby.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:37.503
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.423
I'm not burned. It's okay.

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:43.631
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:47.388
It's okay.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.883
Gotta go to Wallbrook now.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.231
That's why they put you away.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.779
They thought you'd hurt me.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.982
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.650
What?

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:15.169
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:16:15.946 --> 01:16:17.155
What, Ray?

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:19.708
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:22.794
What?

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:29.000
Come on, it's 11:00, Ray.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:31.178
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:42.180
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.654
Never, never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:54.330
There you go. Right where you
like it, at the end of the bed.

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.681
Come on, Ray.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:57.005
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:00.091
Well, you didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.109
Listen, I...

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:07.365
I just wanna hear
it's not over. I mean...

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:10.185
I'm scared it's over.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.978
<i>Don't ask me tonight, Charlie.</i>

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:14.355
<i>I don't know what
to say. Let it sit.</i>

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.941
That's something I'm
not real good at.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:19.777
<i>There's a lot of things
you're not good at.</i>

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.613
I'll call you when
I get back, okay?

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:23.586
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:26.743
I'll see you.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:28.636
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:55.999
What are you looking
at that for, Ray?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.875
I just spent a couple of hundred
dollars on a little TV,

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.294
and now you're watching a dryer.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.045
I don't know.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:03.506
'Cause believe me, Ray, at the shrink
hearing, we're gonna have to prove

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:05.049
you prefer to watch this little TV,

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:06.426
as opposed to the clothes dryer.

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:07.760
- You understand that?
- Yeah.

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:10.179
- You listening to me?
- Yeah.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.348
Turn this off, will you,
when you're not watching it?

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:13.433
Yeah.

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:17.103
If you run down the batteries, then where
are you gonna be at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.731
Yeah, the red one
always falls the same.

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:21.941
Why aren't you listening to me?

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:23.484
You just don't want to
listen to me, do you?

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:26.446
You want to go back to
Wallbrook, is that it?

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.544
I gotta make a phone call.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:40.376
Yeah, Lenny, it's me, listen...

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:41.586
<i>Charlie, where have you been?</i>

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:43.421
<i>I've been sitting by this
phone for three hours, man.</i>

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:45.548
I had some things to do. I had
to buy some clothes and stuff.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:48.968
<i>Clothes? Charlie, we are in
serious trouble. Serious trouble!</i>

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:50.136
<i>What are you doing buying clothes?</i>

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.347
Just take it easy. Take it easy.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.057
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there in a few...

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:55.892
<i>They repossessed the cars
to pay off the loan.</i>

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:58.936
<i>The cars are gone,
Charlie. Gone.</i>

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:01.522
<i>Bateman wants his down
payment back. They all do.</i>

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.950
<i>That's 80 thou, Charlie.</i>

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:06.235
$80,000.

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:07.612
I don't have it.

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:10.615
<i>Look, you gotta pay these
people back, or it's all over,</i>

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:12.533
<i>we're out of business.</i>

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.951
<i>What am I gonna tell them?</i>

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:15.924
I don't know.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.764
Son of a bitch!

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:37.642
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:47.610
<i>Beyond the blue horizon</i>

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:55.090
<i>Lies the rising sun</i>

01:21:55.619 --> 01:22:01.874
<i>Beyond the blue horizon</i>

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:08.523
<i>Waits a beautiful day</i>

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:14.720
This would be a lot easier, Ray,
if you just let me put the top up.

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:16.522
You wouldn't have to fry.

01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:18.599
Put this lotion on you so
you don't burn. All right?

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.401
- Oh. Oh.
- Ray.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.353
Don't start with that. You
want me to put the top up?

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.479
I definitely like the top down.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.648
Yes, I know that. Now,
I don't want you to burn.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:29.652
Yeah. Definitely like it
when the top's... Ow. Ooh.

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:32.321
It's all right. Just take
it easy. Take it easy.

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:33.948
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.284
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.086
Very slippery.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.464
<i>Maldonado swings and hits
a hot shot through the box</i>

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:52.359
<i>into center field for a base hit.</i>

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:53.759
<i>One run is in.</i>

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.178
<i>Here's Brenly going to third.</i>

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.679
<i>The throw by Davis...</i>

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.857
<i>Not in time!</i>

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:03.769
<i>Brenly in safely at third
base on Maldonado's single.</i>

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:04.979
<i>Looks like he held that ball</i>

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.565
<i>out in center field a little bit
too long, don't you think so, Ed?</i>

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:09.901
<i>Take a look at it once again.</i>

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:13.488
<i>Treadwell played it way over
towards the right side.</i>

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:15.711
<i>Shading him to pull.</i>

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.338
<i>Okay, here's Davis.</i>

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:22.455
<i>Yeah, he seems to hold it
there just a bit, Tom.</i>

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:24.040
<i>Sort of double-pumped
it, didn't he?</i>

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.263
<i>Watch it here on the replay again.</i>

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.544
<i>He loses all chance
at a play on Brenly,</i>

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:32.599
<i>even though Brenly doesn't exactly
pick 'em up and lay 'em down.</i>

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:37.445
<i>And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit long...</i>

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:11.462
Will you give me a break with this?

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.435
Can't.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.842
Ray, stop it.

01:24:16.843 --> 01:24:20.805
<i>But there is something
every woman needs</i>

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:27.113

K-7? What's that?

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:37.793
J-7.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.084
What's J-7?

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:44.787
What's J-7? The song?
The song's J-7?

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:45.830
Yeah.

<i>Lonely women make good lovers</i>

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.963
<i>So if you've got a woman...</i>

01:24:53.964 --> 01:24:56.007
Look out there, Raymond.

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:58.560
- No, Raymond, out here.
- Yeah.

- Yeah.

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.478
You seeing that, Ray,
you catching that?

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:52.656
Yeah, falling on the ground.

01:25:55.025 --> 01:25:57.443
Okay. Now what...

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:59.487

I'm an excellent driver.

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:35.272
You can't drive now, Ray.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:36.774
Are you listening to me?
This is very important.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:40.695
When there's lots of 10s left, 10s and
picture cards left, it's good for us.

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:41.904
Now, come on, say it.
"10s are good."

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:43.197
10s are good.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:44.448
Okay, if you're going to bet one...

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:46.784
One if it's bad, two if it's good.

01:26:46.785 --> 01:26:49.120
That's right.
Two if it's good, Ray.

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:52.344
Now, listen, casinos
have house rules.

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:56.377
The first one is, they
don't like to lose.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:59.505
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:01.841
That is the cardinal sin, Ray.

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:04.468
Are you listening to me?
That's very, very important.

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:07.346
Yeah. Counting is bad.

01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:09.765
Yes, counting is bad.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:11.976
I like to drive slow
on the driveway.

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:13.519
You get this right, Ray,

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.188
you can drive wherever you
want as slow as you like.

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:18.491

He doesn't want to hit.

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.745

- No, don't!

You took my queen, Ray.

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:09.486
I've got a 10, I needed that queen.

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:10.779
I can't take your queen!

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:13.073
Sir, please don't touch the cards.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.491
I need my own queen, Ray.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:16.635
There's lots of them.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:19.639
- There's lots of them?
- Lots and lots of them.

01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:22.676
Hold on here for a second.

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:27.517
I'm gonna double down.

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:30.841
Queen, queen.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:32.343
Yes!

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:35.738
Yes, sir. You gotta love this town.

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:38.942
I'm going for it, Nick.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:40.309
It looks like it.

01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:42.953
It certainly looks like it.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:30:59.787
Wanna bet one chip
or two chips, Ray?

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.714
Bet two.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.932
Bet two.

01:31:49.879 --> 01:31:51.588
What's your secret, guys?

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:53.090
We cheat.

01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:58.821
This is Sam. Tape table 47.

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:06.270
About $85,000.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:09.440
$85,000? Did you call
the Eye in the Sky?

01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:10.524
Sam did.

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:11.859
Sam did? Okay, I'll
take over from here.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.661
All right.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:21.426
All right!

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:24.972
You're doing well.
I'm happy for you, sir.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.461
What do you see?

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:33.756
Well, he's not catching the hole
card and he's not past posting us.

01:32:33.757 --> 01:32:36.133
I don't see him using a computer.

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:37.676
No, he's not, but
something's not right.

01:32:37.677 --> 01:32:41.230
You know there's no one in the world
can count into a six-deck shoe.

01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:16.933
Hold it. Hold it here.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:19.843
Watch my chips. I'm
gonna be back in second.

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:21.861
Go right ahead, sir.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:26.225
Ray, what are you doing?
We're in the middle of a hand.

01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:28.268
You don't leave in the middle
of a hand. Ray, Ray, Ray!

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:31.522
We're hot. We are red hot! The Babbitt
brothers, kickin' ass in Vegas!

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:33.132
<i>- Wheel of Fortune.</i>
- We got Cleopatra...

01:33:33.133 --> 01:33:35.295
and Caesar over there waiting
for you. Come on, Ray.

01:33:35.296 --> 01:33:37.361
"Look at all this
glamorous merchandise."

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:39.196
- One for bad, two for good.
- 20.

01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:41.031
20? Yeah.

01:33:41.032 --> 01:33:42.199
It's going to hit on 20?

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.409
Yeah, 20, definitely 20.

01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:47.258
$3,000 On 20.

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:49.623
Definitely 20.

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:51.676
- Definitely 20?
- Yeah.

01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:00.017
Uh-oh.

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:03.679
- It's not your game, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.764
- I just lost $3,000.
- Yeah.

01:34:05.765 --> 01:34:07.266
That's $3,000 I lost.

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:09.393
Come on, Ray, come on, a little...

01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:13.313
No? Easy, don't start
banging yourself, all right?

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.941
- Maybe we'll play a little bit later.
- Yeah.

01:34:15.942 --> 01:34:18.540
- I'm gonna cash in.
- Yeah, cash in.

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:20.708
You make me sad, Ray.

01:34:22.198 --> 01:34:24.045
20.

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:29.204
We won $86,000 and some
change, right, Ray?

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:30.581
$86,500.

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:32.599
$80,000.

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.751
Refund on the car payments,

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:36.003
and I owe...

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:38.630
What did I say I owe
to get the Rolex back?

01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:39.756
$3,500.

01:34:39.757 --> 01:34:41.091
Six months to pay.

01:34:41.092 --> 01:34:44.678
$3,500. We don't have to pay
for the room, that's comped.

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:47.652
I'm free and clear. I'm gonna
go take a celebration piss.

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:53.645
Don't go anywhere. Until I get
back, the sign says "Don't walk."

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:56.289
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:16.510
Hey.

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.338
You looking for a date?

01:35:19.339 --> 01:35:21.381
- Are you?
- I don't know.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:23.300
- What's your name?
- Raymond.

01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:25.318
My name is Iris.

01:35:25.762 --> 01:35:27.471
Raymond, you like me?

01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:29.139
I don't know.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.974
You don't know?

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:32.768
I think if you gave me
a chance, you would.

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:34.937
Why don't we try to get
to know each other?

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.355
Yeah, get to know each other.

01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:38.783
He doesn't have any money, honey.

01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:42.486
That's all right, sugar,
'cause we are just talking.

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:44.789
Yeah, we're just talking.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:47.491
Let's go upstairs, Ray.
What are you doing, man?

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:49.326
Getting to know each other.

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:51.495
- Just talking.
- What room? I'll bring him up.

01:35:51.496 --> 01:35:53.593
That's all right.

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:55.374
Is that what you want to do?

01:35:55.375 --> 01:35:56.833
You want to stay here and get
to know each other, Ray?

01:35:56.834 --> 01:36:00.254
Yeah. Get to know
each other. Just talking.

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:01.672
- This will be interesting.
- Yeah.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:04.646
- I'll be over here just in case.
- Yeah.

01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:06.885
He doesn't seem to
like me. Who is he?

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:09.179
He's my brother.
I'm living in his room.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.722
He seems young to be your brother.

01:36:10.723 --> 01:36:13.558
He was born August 12, 1962.

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:15.576
It was a Sunday.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:19.831
What exactly do you guys do here?

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:21.692
We're counting cards.

01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:23.527
You're counting cards?

01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:25.529
We're counting cards.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:27.864
- Uh-huh.
- We're counting cards.

01:36:27.865 --> 01:36:30.008
What else do you do?

01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:31.952
We're counting cards.

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:34.162
I know that you're counting cards.
What else do you do?

01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:36.790
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:39.844
Whoa. Look, I'm out of here.

01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:42.045
Course, what time is the date?

01:36:42.046 --> 01:36:44.047
- Later.
- What time is the date?

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:46.080
- It's 10:00!
- Course, I have to be in bed at 11:00.

01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:50.696
Lights out at 11:00. 10:00
daylight-saving time.

01:36:50.722 --> 01:36:53.974
- 10:00 daylight-saving time.
- 10:00?

01:36:53.975 --> 01:36:55.392
You like her, Ray?
You think she's pretty?

01:36:55.393 --> 01:36:57.394
Yeah. She's very sparkly.

01:36:57.395 --> 01:37:01.039
- Definitely very sparkly.
- Very sparkly.

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:04.735
He did a great job on that suit.

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:06.862
You don't realize
how good you look.

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:09.336
- Do you like it?
- It's not Kmart.

01:37:09.365 --> 01:37:10.782
How could you not like that suit?

01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:12.617
You look fantastic, Ray.

01:37:12.618 --> 01:37:14.911
- How can you not like that suit?
- It's not a Kmart suit.

01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:16.705
- I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
- Yeah.

01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:20.055
- Kmart sucks. Okay?
- Yeah.

01:37:22.754 --> 01:37:24.546
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:37:24.547 --> 01:37:26.423
It's the high rollers' suite.

01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:28.396
This is for you.

01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:31.053
Ever seen a room like this before?

01:37:31.054 --> 01:37:32.679
What's up there?

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:33.805
What's up there?

01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:35.474
You're not even looking, man.

01:37:35.475 --> 01:37:36.600
Yeah. Bed.

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:37.976
That's a bed. That's your bed.

01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:39.353
I had them put it up there
especially for you,

01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:40.687
right by the window, just
the way you like it.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.490
- Bed by the window.
- That's right. Go on up.

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:46.876
- Just the way you like it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:50.447
Look at you with all
those lights, Ray.

01:37:50.448 --> 01:37:53.950
Mr. Vegas. You are
Mr. Las Vegas now, man.

01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:55.243
What do you think?

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:58.923
There's a lot of lights out there.
Very sparkly. Very twinkly.

01:37:59.248 --> 01:38:00.749
We made a lot of money today.

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.793
We made a lot of money!

01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:06.963
Forgetting the $3,000 that we tossed
away at that wheel of fortune.

01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:09.257
Yeah, wheel of fortune.

01:38:09.258 --> 01:38:10.634
I'm sorry about that.

01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:12.886
I'm sorry, you know, I got
a little carried away.

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:16.315
- I got a little hot, okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:21.195
I'm saying that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

01:38:22.522 --> 01:38:24.314
I'm apologizing.

01:38:24.315 --> 01:38:26.149
I got a little carried away.

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:30.124
The money... I got a little greedy.

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:31.321
Want to say something?

01:38:31.322 --> 01:38:33.824
I have to be at the bar
at 10:00 with Iris.

01:38:33.825 --> 01:38:35.659
I mean, 'cause, you know,
I've got to thank you, man.

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.632
You...

01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:39.996
You did it. You did it.

01:38:39.997 --> 01:38:41.915
I was just there.

01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:43.500
You saved my ass.

01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:46.211
I was just along for the ride.

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:48.755
Have to be at the bar at 10:00.

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.132
Have to go to the date with Iris.

01:38:50.133 --> 01:38:52.175
Yeah, Iris. That's her name.

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:53.677
Big date. Going to go dancing.

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:55.011
Yeah, dancing.

01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:57.097
Have to go to the date with
Iris at the bar, dancing.

01:38:57.098 --> 01:38:58.807
Know how to dance?

01:38:58.808 --> 01:38:59.975
I don't know.

01:38:59.976 --> 01:39:01.893
You don't know how to dance?
You ought to learn sometime.

01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:07.315
Have to learn to dance with a date.

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:10.527
I was just kidding, Ray. You're not
gonna have to dance on this date.

01:39:10.528 --> 01:39:12.237
Have to go to the date.
Learn to dance.

01:39:12.238 --> 01:39:14.489
Definitely. Now.

01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:15.866
Ray, you don't have to dance now,

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:17.409
but, listen, I'll teach you
how to dance sometime.

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:18.660
Definitely have to.

01:39:18.661 --> 01:39:20.370
No, you're not gonna
have to dance on this.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:22.581
Definitely have to learn
to dance now for the date.

01:39:22.582 --> 01:39:24.541
Sorry I even brought
this up. All right, Ray.

01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:27.043
- You're right. My mistake.
- 10:00.

01:39:27.044 --> 01:39:30.172
You got the only famous
dancing hooker in Vegas.

01:39:30.173 --> 01:39:32.020
All right. Stand over there.

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:39.764
<i>My lonely days are over</i>

01:39:39.765 --> 01:39:41.817
- Come over here.
- Yeah.

01:39:43.144 --> 01:39:45.020
- Now, you hear the music?
- Yeah.

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:46.563
Just watch my feet.

01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:48.741
Raymond, watch my feet.

01:39:49.025 --> 01:39:51.293
- Yeah.
- Just do what I'm doing.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:54.029
Okay, you see? You feel
the rhythm of the music?

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:56.364
We're just moving
our feet like that.

01:39:56.365 --> 01:39:59.659
Okay? Now, you're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.703
All right, and I'm the
date, so you want to...

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:04.247
<i>The skies above are blue</i>

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:05.957
You want to...

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.667
Put your left hand up like this.

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:08.752
Raymond, don't stop moving.

01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:10.420
- Raymond, paying attention?
- Yeah.

01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:13.048
Don't stop moving. Put
your left hand up like this.

01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:15.133
- Yeah.
- Left hand up. That's good.

01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:17.511
Don't stop moving.
Just keep moving.

01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:18.762
That's good. Just like that.

01:40:18.763 --> 01:40:22.265
Now you wanna take this other hand, you
wanna put it around behind my back.

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:24.142
- Want to learn how to dance?
- Yeah.

01:40:24.143 --> 01:40:26.061
Okay, 'cause you gotta touch
someone when you dance.

01:40:26.062 --> 01:40:28.772
- I'm not going to hurt you, all right?
- Yeah.

01:40:28.773 --> 01:40:30.857
Just put it right there.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:33.443
I take my hand, I put it up here.

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:34.736
Watch my feet, Ray.

01:40:34.737 --> 01:40:37.631
Watch my feet. The
rhythm, the rhythm.

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:39.741
All right?

01:40:39.742 --> 01:40:41.660
Now, when you dance you can't
watch my feet the whole time,

01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:43.954
- so you're gonna have to look up.
- Yeah.

01:40:43.955 --> 01:40:48.667
When I tell you to, I want you
to just look up, real slow.

01:40:48.668 --> 01:40:50.585
Just keep moving.

01:40:50.586 --> 01:40:52.170
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:54.268
- All right, start looking up.
- Yeah.

01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:57.133
A little more. Keep moving.

01:40:57.134 --> 01:40:59.481
- Just a little more.
- Yeah.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.846
A little more, Ray.

01:41:01.847 --> 01:41:03.348
All the way up.

01:41:03.349 --> 01:41:05.934
<i>You smile</i>

01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:07.686
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:08.979
You're dancing. This is it.

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.480
Yeah, dancing.

01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:13.149
You want to close your
hand here. Just...

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.151
You wanna pull like that.

01:41:15.152 --> 01:41:17.237
You're gonna turn
me like this, okay?

01:41:17.238 --> 01:41:18.947
<i>Here we are in heaven</i>

01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:20.865
Just turn. That's good.

01:41:20.866 --> 01:41:23.493
- This is dancing.
- This is dancing.

01:41:23.494 --> 01:41:25.412
Don't know about you, but I'm
starting to feel a little silly.

01:41:25.413 --> 01:41:28.790
<i>For you are mine</i>

01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:33.437
<i>At last</i>

01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:01.615
- That's it.
- Yeah.

01:42:01.616 --> 01:42:04.159
All right! All right!

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:06.202
- Beautiful! You are a good dancer!
- Yeah.

01:42:06.203 --> 01:42:07.495
- You wanna give me a hug?
- Yeah.

01:42:07.496 --> 01:42:08.788
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:24.109
I just wanted to
give you a hug, Ray.

01:42:25.973 --> 01:42:28.525
Just felt like giving you a hug.

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.617
What are you doing here?

01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:47.243
I'm unemployed.

01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:48.286
What do you mean?

01:42:48.287 --> 01:42:50.372
- You don't know about the business?
- I know about the business.

01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:53.050
Come on in. It's okay.

01:42:54.794 --> 01:42:57.847
I'm glad to see you.

01:42:58.047 --> 01:42:59.798
Ray, look who's here.

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:27.784
It's not right, what
you're doing to Raymond.

01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:29.119
He's fine.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:34.165
I know he's fine. He's in Las
Vegas in a suit, in a big room.

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:35.875
It makes me sad.

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:37.377
Six minutes to my date.

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:39.555
Six minutes to Iris.

01:43:40.131 --> 01:43:42.353
He has a date?

01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:44.217
Raymond, it'd be nice

01:43:44.218 --> 01:43:47.387
if you didn't carry that
television everywhere we go.

01:43:47.388 --> 01:43:49.848
What do you gotta bring a
Watchman for on your date?

01:43:49.849 --> 01:43:51.808
The man's dancing.

01:43:51.809 --> 01:43:55.112
But what does your date
look like, Raymond?

01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:56.479
She's very sparkly.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.748
She looks like a holiday.

01:44:00.359 --> 01:44:01.693
I don't think I've
heard that one before.

01:44:01.694 --> 01:44:02.986
Mr. Babbitt.

01:44:02.987 --> 01:44:05.572
Mr. Kelso would like to see you.

01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:08.283
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.
- He's director of security.

01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:09.993
Would you come with me, please?

01:44:09.994 --> 01:44:12.328
Sure. Listen, Susanna, why
don't you stay with Raymond?

01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:13.830
Right this way, sir.

01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:32.056
10:01. She's not here.

01:44:32.057 --> 01:44:34.951
She'll come. She will.

01:44:43.736 --> 01:44:45.361
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.

01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:48.031
Counting into a six-deck
shoe is quite a feat.

01:44:48.032 --> 01:44:50.658
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're talking about.

01:44:50.659 --> 01:44:52.994
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,

01:44:52.995 --> 01:44:54.621
and we analyze the tapes,

01:44:54.622 --> 01:44:57.373
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

01:44:57.374 --> 01:44:59.751
These tapes suggest that you
should take your winnings

01:44:59.752 --> 01:45:01.377
and leave the state.

01:45:01.378 --> 01:45:03.463
Mr. Kelso, someone has
a good day at the tables

01:45:03.464 --> 01:45:06.466
and you accuse them of
illegal activities?

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:08.551
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:11.054
All you have to do is close
your mouth and go home.

01:45:11.055 --> 01:45:14.182
And those are the best odds
you're gonna see for a while.

01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:16.030
I'd take 'em.

01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:26.637
Did you want to dance
on your date, Ray?

01:45:26.638 --> 01:45:29.798
- Yeah.
- There'll be other chances, Ray.

01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:32.126
Many pretty girls would
love to dance with you.

01:45:32.127 --> 01:45:33.176
Yeah.

01:45:33.202 --> 01:45:35.219
- It's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:52.762
Uh-oh.

01:45:52.763 --> 01:45:54.264
I like this music, Ray.

01:45:54.265 --> 01:45:55.348
Elevator stopped.

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:56.766
It's okay.

01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:59.769
You think you could show me the way
you were going to dance with Iris?

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:01.771
- Yeah.
- Yes?

01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:03.481
Would you like to dance with me?

01:46:03.482 --> 01:46:05.108
Elevator's on hold.

01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:07.411
- It's okay. Give me this.
- Yeah.

01:46:11.115 --> 01:46:12.574
Show me. Show me how.

01:46:12.575 --> 01:46:14.742
Yeah. Charlie Babbitt taught me.

01:46:14.743 --> 01:46:17.090
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:20.598
Dancing in the elevator.

01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:23.222
It's nice.

01:46:25.588 --> 01:46:28.015
You're very good.

01:46:40.603 --> 01:46:43.104
Iris missed a beautiful dance.

01:46:43.105 --> 01:46:45.031
Yeah.

01:46:45.482 --> 01:46:48.284
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, and a kiss.

01:46:48.402 --> 01:46:49.485
Have you ever kissed a girl?

01:46:49.486 --> 01:46:51.538
I don't know.

01:46:52.615 --> 01:46:54.712
You don't know?

01:46:56.201 --> 01:46:59.003
Open your mouth. Open.

01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:01.831
Like this.

01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:05.543
Like you are tasting
something very good

01:47:05.544 --> 01:47:07.846
and very soft.

01:47:11.175 --> 01:47:12.508
Like this.

01:47:12.509 --> 01:47:14.606
Close your eyes.

01:47:21.226 --> 01:47:23.573
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:47:31.904 --> 01:47:33.404
How was that?

01:47:33.405 --> 01:47:35.422
Wet.

01:47:36.241 --> 01:47:37.367
Then we did it right.

01:47:37.368 --> 01:47:39.369
Elevator's definitely stuck.

01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:41.672
No, it's not stuck.

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:51.564
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

01:47:52.716 --> 01:47:55.359
- Like us.
- Yeah, like us.

01:47:55.719 --> 01:47:57.178
What did I tell you, Ray?

01:47:57.179 --> 01:47:59.097
I promised you could
drive, this is it.

01:47:59.098 --> 01:48:01.140
At Wallbrook, I drive
slow on the driveway.

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:03.059
Charlie, this is okay?
He can drive?

01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.686
Course, I'm an excellent driver.

01:48:04.687 --> 01:48:06.704
He's very good in the driveway.

01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:06.719
Ray, why don't you get
in the front seat?

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.377
So I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:11.658
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

01:49:11.661 --> 01:49:14.297
- It's gonna be fine, okay?
- Oh, yeah.

01:49:14.298 --> 01:49:15.798
- I'm nervous.
- I know.

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:19.594
Listen, I'm glad... Happy. I'm
happy that you came to Vegas.

01:49:19.595 --> 01:49:20.845
I know.

01:49:23.182 --> 01:49:25.108
Ciao.

01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:29.520
Ray, thank you for the
date in the elevator.

01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:31.064
- It was really nice.
- Yeah.

01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:32.190
- Ciao.
- Yeah.

01:49:32.191 --> 01:49:33.441
Thank you for the what? What?

01:49:33.442 --> 01:49:35.651
Nothing. Something between us.

01:49:35.652 --> 01:49:38.329
- Between us?
- Mmm-hmm, us.

01:49:41.325 --> 01:49:43.342
Us, Ray?

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:50.333
Here we go, Ray.

01:49:50.334 --> 01:49:51.667
This is your bedroom up here.

01:49:51.668 --> 01:49:54.295
Course, there's no bed there.
Definitely no bed there.

01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:57.507
Oh, no, this is a magic bed, Ray.

01:49:57.508 --> 01:49:59.300
You just watch and see.

01:49:59.301 --> 01:50:02.595
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:05.515
Went to the video store, I got a
little surprise for you, Ray.

01:50:05.516 --> 01:50:07.225
I picked up a video for you.

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:09.519
Don't start with that, Ray.

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.062
This is...

01:50:11.063 --> 01:50:12.480
It's not just another place, Ray.

01:50:12.481 --> 01:50:15.329
This is... This is my place.

01:50:15.776 --> 01:50:18.027
That's the man's name.
That's whose name? Yes.

01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:20.530
Who? The first baseman.
Who's on first.

01:50:20.531 --> 01:50:22.365
You got a first baseman?

01:50:22.366 --> 01:50:24.450
Who's playing first? Absolutely.

01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:26.619
<i>When you pay off the first
baseman, who gets the money?</i>

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.413
<i>Every dollar of it. Why not?</i>

01:50:29.414 --> 01:50:30.706
<i>- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?</i>

01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:32.375
Yes.

01:50:32.376 --> 01:50:34.293
<i>- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?</i>

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:36.212
<i>Sometimes his wife comes
down and collects it.</i>

01:50:36.213 --> 01:50:38.089
<i>- Whose wife?
- Yes.</i>

01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:41.092
<i>- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?</i>

01:50:41.093 --> 01:50:42.802
<i>Absolutely.</i>

01:50:42.803 --> 01:50:45.221
<i>All I'm tryin' to find out is what's
the guy's name on first base?</i>

01:50:45.222 --> 01:50:47.890
<i>No. What is on second base.</i>

01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:49.559
This is funny, Ray. Don't
you think this is funny?

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.519
Yeah, this is funny.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.146
<i>I'm not changing nobody.</i>

01:50:53.147 --> 01:50:54.355
Where'd you see this first?

01:50:54.356 --> 01:50:56.399
Dad gave me a book
of baseball trivia.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.651
- Dad, huh?
<i>- I'm not asking you who's on second.</i>

01:50:58.652 --> 01:51:01.580
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.

01:51:01.613 --> 01:51:03.739
<i>We're not talking about him.</i>

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:05.575
<i>Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.</i>

01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:07.577
<i>I'd like you to call me...</i>

01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:08.995
Yeah, what is it?

01:51:08.996 --> 01:51:10.872
<i>Oh, I thought I got the machine.</i>

01:51:10.873 --> 01:51:12.081
No.

01:51:12.082 --> 01:51:13.457
<i>I just got into town,
and, as you know,</i>

01:51:13.458 --> 01:51:16.294
<i>the psychological interview
is tomorrow, Charlie.</i>

01:51:16.295 --> 01:51:18.004
Yes, sir, I know that.

01:51:18.005 --> 01:51:20.464
<i>I thought we should get
together and talk.</i>

01:51:20.465 --> 01:51:23.134
<i>I really think it might be in
your best interest to meet me.</i>

01:51:23.135 --> 01:51:24.260
All right.

01:51:24.261 --> 01:51:25.428
When?

01:51:25.429 --> 01:51:26.762
<i>I'm at the Bonaventure.</i>

01:51:26.763 --> 01:51:28.347
<i>How about tonight at 8:30?</i>

01:51:51.038 --> 01:51:53.875
Tomorrow morning you'll meet Dr.
Marston who's in charge of Raymond's

01:51:53.876 --> 01:51:56.100
- psychiatric evaluation.
- Yeah, I know.

01:51:56.126 --> 01:51:58.836
I gave him boxes of files
on Raymond. Boxes.

01:51:58.837 --> 01:52:00.129
Well, good luck.

01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:02.924
Look, this isn't a close
call, son. It's a formality.

01:52:02.925 --> 01:52:04.800
Your brother's a very
disabled individual.

01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:06.719
You trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.803
Is that why you called me up here?

01:52:07.804 --> 01:52:10.473
No, I'm telling you it's always
been a lost cause, Charlie.

01:52:10.474 --> 01:52:11.933
Then what is this about?
Why'd you call me?

01:52:11.934 --> 01:52:15.019
Let me tell you something. Your father put
me in charge of all the money, all right?

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.145
Yeah.

01:52:16.146 --> 01:52:19.106
And it doesn't matter whether or
not you win custody of Raymond.

01:52:19.107 --> 01:52:20.816
I won't have to pay you a dime.

01:52:20.817 --> 01:52:22.860
It's at my discretion,
not the court's.

01:52:22.861 --> 01:52:24.195
What, so you can't lose?

01:52:24.196 --> 01:52:25.488
I can lose.

01:52:25.489 --> 01:52:26.822
I can lose Raymond.

01:52:26.823 --> 01:52:29.825
I happen to care about your brother's
life and the treatment he receives.

01:52:29.826 --> 01:52:31.869
I made a commitment to your
father some 20 years ago,

01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:34.764
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

01:52:36.124 --> 01:52:37.416
What is this?

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:39.639
It's a very big check.

01:52:42.547 --> 01:52:44.590
$250,000.

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:46.342
And no strings attached.

01:52:46.343 --> 01:52:48.565
You just walk away, Charlie.

01:52:49.054 --> 01:52:51.472
You know, this isn't
about you and me.

01:52:51.473 --> 01:52:53.866
It's not about winning or losing.

01:52:55.978 --> 01:52:59.814
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

01:52:59.815 --> 01:53:01.832
You didn't have an answer.

01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:04.827
I don't know.

01:53:06.363 --> 01:53:07.697
It's funny, I just realized

01:53:07.698 --> 01:53:11.342
I'm not pissed off anymore my
father cut me out of his will.

01:53:12.703 --> 01:53:14.287
You were his friend, you
probably knew he tried

01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:17.164
to contact me a few
times over the years.

01:53:17.165 --> 01:53:19.125
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

01:53:19.126 --> 01:53:21.043
If he was my son,
didn't return my calls,

01:53:21.044 --> 01:53:22.878
I'd have written him out. Fuck him.

01:53:22.879 --> 01:53:25.602
But it's not about
the money anymore.

01:53:26.842 --> 01:53:30.094
It's about... I just
don't understand

01:53:30.095 --> 01:53:31.762
why didn't he tell
me I had a brother?

01:53:31.763 --> 01:53:33.055
Why didn't you tell
me I had a brother?

01:53:33.056 --> 01:53:37.201
Why didn't anyone ever tell
me that I had a brother?

01:53:38.228 --> 01:53:40.154
I mean...

01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:45.035
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

01:55:09.194 --> 01:55:11.837
Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

01:55:27.295 --> 01:55:29.171
Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

01:55:29.172 --> 01:55:30.506
Ray!

01:55:30.507 --> 01:55:31.966
Come on.

01:55:31.967 --> 01:55:35.065
It stopped. It's all right.

01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:43.811
V-E-R-N.

01:55:43.812 --> 01:55:45.989
Vern. Vern.

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:48.916
Main man. My main man, Vern.

01:55:49.734 --> 01:55:51.786
V-E-R-N.

01:55:55.031 --> 01:55:56.832
Uh-oh.

01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:01.133
My main man, Vern.

01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:07.014
V-E-R-N. Vern. My main man.

01:56:07.043 --> 01:56:09.211
All right, Ray, they got
raspberry, strawberry, blueberry,

01:56:09.212 --> 01:56:11.380
Pink Caddie, whole-wheat,
Peachy Keen, beer nut,

01:56:11.381 --> 01:56:14.341
Rocky Road, buckwheat,
Belly Buster, blueberry.

01:56:14.342 --> 01:56:15.593
What kind of pancakes
you want, Ray?

01:56:15.594 --> 01:56:17.428
- Pancakes.
- Yeah. What kind?

01:56:17.429 --> 01:56:19.346
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

01:56:19.347 --> 01:56:22.224
Course, maple syrup is supposed to
be on the table before the pancakes.

01:56:22.225 --> 01:56:23.267
- Ray.
- Yeah.

01:56:23.268 --> 01:56:25.115
Ta-da.

01:56:27.439 --> 01:56:29.064
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

01:56:29.065 --> 01:56:31.242
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:56:51.213 --> 01:56:53.640
Step back a little bit, Ray.

01:57:13.443 --> 01:57:15.415
Hello?

01:57:16.112 --> 01:57:18.880
Why don't you go sit
down over there?

01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:24.119
Hello?

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.955
This is not a legal
proceeding, Mr. Babbitt,

01:57:25.956 --> 01:57:27.873
so there's no lawyers,
no judge present,

01:57:27.874 --> 01:57:30.642
just the people who
care about Raymond.

01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:32.753
Raymond, why don't you
have a seat over there?

01:57:32.754 --> 01:57:34.505
Mr. Babbitt, why don't you go
to that side of the table?

01:57:34.506 --> 01:57:36.298
Raymond, right here. Have a seat.

01:57:36.299 --> 01:57:38.759
Raymond, right here.
Take this seat, okay?

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.553
Ray, you can put your
knapsack on the floor.

01:57:40.554 --> 01:57:43.305
I think this is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

01:57:43.306 --> 01:57:45.933
- And the TV. Ray, the TV.
- Yeah.

01:57:45.934 --> 01:57:48.185
- On the floor. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

01:57:48.186 --> 01:57:51.564
I don't know any easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt...

01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:52.773
To say what?

01:57:52.774 --> 01:57:55.317
- Have I lost already?
- No, you haven't lost.

01:57:55.318 --> 01:57:58.737
I'm not the judge and jury. I'm just a
doctor making a recommendation to a court.

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:00.030
Now, I must tell you
that Dr. Bruner

01:58:00.031 --> 01:58:02.199
is a very respected professional.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:05.077
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years,

01:58:05.078 --> 01:58:08.330
and, of course, Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions we have in this country.

01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:10.624
Boy, you guys have already made
up your mind. I'll see you in court.

01:58:10.625 --> 01:58:11.667
Hold on, son. No one's your enemy.

01:58:11.668 --> 01:58:13.335
My brother came further
with me in a week

01:58:13.336 --> 01:58:15.170
than he did with you in 20 years.
And that's the truth.

01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:17.172
- I don't think...
- You don't know anything about us!

01:58:17.173 --> 01:58:19.258
I don't think it's necessary
to challenge Dr. Bruner.

01:58:19.259 --> 01:58:20.759
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.803
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

01:58:22.804 --> 01:58:25.681
- Well, we got...
- I was asking Raymond.

01:58:25.682 --> 01:58:28.655
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

01:58:29.019 --> 01:58:31.020
- What did you do, Raymond?
- Counted cards.

01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:33.105
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

01:58:33.106 --> 01:58:34.648
Your brother took you to Las Vegas?

01:58:34.649 --> 01:58:37.192
$3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

01:58:37.193 --> 01:58:39.194
He gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

01:58:39.195 --> 01:58:42.448
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

01:58:42.449 --> 01:58:44.783
- What else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:46.327
What else did you do?

01:58:46.328 --> 01:58:47.953
Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:49.955
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn how to dance

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:51.790
- so I taught him.
- Danced in the elevator with Susanna.

01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:53.042
Kissed Susanna.

01:58:53.043 --> 01:58:55.252
- Kissed Susanna?
- Yeah. In the elevator.

01:58:55.253 --> 01:58:57.129
Did you enjoy kissing a woman?

01:58:57.130 --> 01:58:58.380
I don't know.

01:58:58.381 --> 01:58:59.548
How did it feel?

01:58:59.549 --> 01:59:00.758
It felt wet.

01:59:00.759 --> 01:59:02.384
- Wet?
- Yeah.

01:59:02.385 --> 01:59:04.653
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

01:59:05.639 --> 01:59:06.889
You enjoy being on the road?

01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:08.265
I'm an excellent driver.

01:59:08.266 --> 01:59:10.392
- You drove?
- Yeah.

01:59:10.393 --> 01:59:12.728
Your brother let you drive on
the highway? The interstate?

01:59:12.729 --> 01:59:13.979
Yeah, slow on the driveway.

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.532
He didn't drive on the highway.

01:59:17.901 --> 01:59:19.568
Did he have any emotional
outbursts this past week?

01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:20.653
What do you mean?

01:59:20.654 --> 01:59:22.529
Well, things they tend to do.

01:59:22.530 --> 01:59:24.573
Inflicting bodily
harm on themselves...

01:59:24.574 --> 01:59:27.076
- Okay, yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

01:59:27.077 --> 01:59:29.662
Okay, he had what you call
an outburst at the airport

01:59:29.663 --> 01:59:32.247
because he didn't want to
fly, so we didn't fly.

01:59:32.248 --> 01:59:33.874
When was the last
outburst that he had?

01:59:33.875 --> 01:59:36.335
- This morning.
- This morning?

01:59:36.336 --> 01:59:39.797
This is bullshit. Because I could tell
you anything, I could tell you nothing,

01:59:39.798 --> 01:59:41.173
and you'd never know
the difference.

01:59:41.174 --> 01:59:43.300
This morning the smoke
alarm went off.

01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:45.094
He got a little
nervous, but he's fine.

01:59:45.095 --> 01:59:47.971
Don't feel as though
I'm placing any blame.

01:59:47.972 --> 01:59:49.306
We went out for pancakes.

01:59:49.307 --> 01:59:52.267
- Look at him, he's fine.
- You don't have to be defensive.

01:59:52.268 --> 01:59:53.811
- I'm not challenging you.
- I'm just being honest with you.

01:59:53.812 --> 01:59:55.354
- You're missing the point.
- You're missing the point.

01:59:55.355 --> 01:59:56.730
I'm being truthful about this.

01:59:56.731 --> 01:59:59.525
The point I was trying to make
is I'm not placing any blame...

01:59:59.526 --> 02:00:01.819
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all,

02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:03.612
I find out a few days ago
that I have a brother,

02:00:03.613 --> 02:00:05.614
and I wanna be with him and
I'm supposed to give him up?

02:00:05.615 --> 02:00:07.366
No one is saying anything...

02:00:07.367 --> 02:00:09.493
I didn't hurt him,
he's not hurting me,

02:00:09.494 --> 02:00:12.371
we're not hurting you. Now, why are
you interfering? This is my family.

02:00:12.372 --> 02:00:13.694
- I'm not interfering.
- This is my family.

02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.541
- Do you understand that?
- I understand that.

02:00:15.542 --> 02:00:16.667
Yes, you do have a brother,

02:00:16.668 --> 02:00:19.962
but the point is he's not capable
of having a relationship with you.

02:00:19.963 --> 02:00:23.006
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

02:00:23.007 --> 02:00:24.299
Have you ever done that?

02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:26.051
Look, you cannot take
on the responsibility

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:27.386
of your brother without
professional guidance.

02:00:27.387 --> 02:00:30.347
- That's your opinion, Dr. Bruner.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

02:00:30.348 --> 02:00:32.224
There's a couple of things I'd
like to go over in this file.

02:00:32.225 --> 02:00:36.103
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution

02:00:36.104 --> 02:00:38.939
and you're willing to trade him for
$1.5 million. Is that correct?

02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:40.983
My father died. I was upset.

02:00:40.984 --> 02:00:42.609
- Okay? That was wrong.
- Okay.

02:00:42.610 --> 02:00:43.986
So last week you were upset,

02:00:43.987 --> 02:00:46.447
and then this week you suddenly
found some devotion to your brother

02:00:46.448 --> 02:00:48.699
and you want to take care of
him the rest of your life?

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:50.752
Yes.

02:00:50.994 --> 02:00:54.079
So in the beginning, it
was like a kidnapping.

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.081
Kidnapping... That's very strong.

02:00:56.082 --> 02:00:57.541
I didn't kidnap my brother.

02:00:57.542 --> 02:01:00.878
But in the course of the week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

02:01:00.879 --> 02:01:02.087
Yes.

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:03.797
Look, that...

02:01:03.798 --> 02:01:05.048
- Yes?
- When we...

02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:07.468
I understand that this
sounds irrational to you.

02:01:07.469 --> 02:01:09.720
Yes, when it started out, it had...

02:01:09.721 --> 02:01:11.805
Don't feel compelled to
be defensive about that.

02:01:11.806 --> 02:01:12.931
- Can I talk?
- Yes, you can.

02:01:12.932 --> 02:01:15.601
- I'd like to talk. Thank you.
- Yes, you can.

02:01:15.602 --> 02:01:17.060
There's no accusations.

02:01:17.061 --> 02:01:18.353
Go ahead.

02:01:18.354 --> 02:01:20.326
There's no accusations?

02:01:21.608 --> 02:01:25.277
See, you have to understand that
when we started out together,

02:01:25.278 --> 02:01:28.155
that he was only my brother

02:01:28.156 --> 02:01:30.173
in name.

02:01:33.495 --> 02:01:35.672
And as...

02:01:38.374 --> 02:01:40.542
Then this morning we had pancakes.

02:01:40.543 --> 02:01:41.585
Maple syrup.

02:01:41.586 --> 02:01:43.086
Maple syrup on the...

02:01:43.087 --> 02:01:45.172
- Maple syrup on the table.
- And pancakes.

02:01:45.173 --> 02:01:48.021
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

02:01:49.219 --> 02:01:51.191
You see, we...

02:01:51.888 --> 02:01:54.014
I made a connection.

02:01:54.015 --> 02:01:55.766
I think that's very admirable
that you made a connection,

02:01:55.767 --> 02:01:58.143
but I think the purpose of
this meeting is to determine

02:01:58.144 --> 02:01:59.561
what is best for Raymond.

02:01:59.562 --> 02:02:02.564
Whether or not he's capable of
functioning in the community,

02:02:02.565 --> 02:02:03.982
and what, in fact, he wants,

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:06.109
if that's possible to determine.

02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:07.361
I'm all for that.

02:02:07.362 --> 02:02:09.780
Raymond's unable to make
those kind of decisions.

02:02:09.781 --> 02:02:10.864
You're wrong.

02:02:10.865 --> 02:02:12.699
Charlie, you know he
can't decide for himself.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:15.077
He's capable of a lot
more than you know.

02:02:15.078 --> 02:02:18.163
Why don't we ask Raymond?
Maybe we can find a few answers.

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:21.262
Raymond, can I ask
you a few questions?

02:02:21.417 --> 02:02:23.126
- Ray, the doctor's talking to you.
- Yeah?

02:02:23.127 --> 02:02:25.725
- Raymond, can I ask you a few questions?
- Yeah.

02:02:27.715 --> 02:02:30.563
Do you want to stay with
your brother Charlie?

02:02:30.927 --> 02:02:34.054
Raymond, would you like to stay with
your brother Charlie in Los Angeles?

02:02:34.055 --> 02:02:36.682
Ray, the doctor's
asking you a question,

02:02:36.683 --> 02:02:38.976
- so you listen, okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

02:02:38.977 --> 02:02:42.405
Raymond, do you want to stay
with your brother Charlie?

02:02:42.939 --> 02:02:44.236
Raymond, do you want to stay...

02:02:44.237 --> 02:02:46.208
- with your brother Charlie?
- Yeah.

02:02:46.234 --> 02:02:48.443
- You do?
- Yeah.

02:02:48.444 --> 02:02:51.029
- You want to stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:53.115
Stay with my brother,
Charlie Babbitt.

02:02:53.116 --> 02:02:55.509
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

02:02:56.870 --> 02:03:00.093
- You want to stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

02:03:02.792 --> 02:03:05.627
- Can I ask you something else, Raymond?
- Yeah.

02:03:05.628 --> 02:03:08.146
- Do you want to go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

02:03:08.798 --> 02:03:12.134
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

02:03:12.135 --> 02:03:13.982
Yeah.

02:03:16.097 --> 02:03:17.764
Do you want to stay with
your brother Charlie

02:03:17.765 --> 02:03:19.808
- here in Los Angeles?
- Yeah.

02:03:19.809 --> 02:03:22.577
- Or do you wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

02:03:22.979 --> 02:03:26.148
Two separate things, stay with your
brother or go back to Wallbrook?

02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:27.816
It's not one thing, Raymond.

02:03:27.817 --> 02:03:29.276
This is your brother.
You make a choice.

02:03:29.277 --> 02:03:30.986
Back to Wallbrook,
stay with Charlie Babbitt.

02:03:30.987 --> 02:03:32.070
Okay.

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:33.864
Back to Wallbrook, stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

02:03:33.865 --> 02:03:35.657
No, no, no. Two separate things.
Can you make that choice?

02:03:35.658 --> 02:03:37.618
- One or the other.
- Yeah, go back to Wallbrook...

02:03:37.619 --> 02:03:39.036
All right.

02:03:39.037 --> 02:03:42.456
- Stay back at Wallbrook.
- Hold on. Just hold on!

02:03:42.457 --> 02:03:45.125
- Stay back at Wallbrook.
- All right.

02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:48.503
You made your point. Okay?
You don't have to humiliate him.

02:03:48.504 --> 02:03:51.673
Ray, it's okay. It's over.

02:03:51.674 --> 02:03:53.050
Yeah.

02:03:53.051 --> 02:03:55.945
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

02:03:56.179 --> 02:03:57.679
Stay back at Wallbrook.

02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:59.056
It's over.

02:03:59.057 --> 02:04:01.450
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:05.854
Dr. Bruner, can I talk
to you for a minute?

02:04:05.855 --> 02:04:08.373
- Of course.
- Excuse me.

02:04:16.157 --> 02:04:18.755
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

02:04:20.453 --> 02:04:22.268
You don't want any more
questions, do you?

02:04:22.269 --> 02:04:25.433
- No.
- No.

02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:28.477
I don't know.

02:04:33.424 --> 02:04:36.009
You don't want any more questions,
do you? No more questions.

02:04:36.010 --> 02:04:37.811
No.

02:04:40.932 --> 02:04:43.225
Don't worry. There's not gonna
be any more questions, okay?

02:04:43.226 --> 02:04:44.303
- Yeah.
- No more questions.

02:04:44.304 --> 02:04:47.925
- I'll make sure of that, okay, Ray?
- Yeah. Main man.

02:04:48.398 --> 02:04:50.950
- What?
- My main man.

02:04:55.238 --> 02:04:57.335
Listen...

02:05:00.410 --> 02:05:03.804
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna have
a chance to talk to you again.

02:05:07.083 --> 02:05:09.510
Because you see, these...

02:05:09.711 --> 02:05:11.294
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,

02:05:11.295 --> 02:05:14.923
and he's probably gonna want
to take you back with him.

02:05:14.924 --> 02:05:17.226
- You know?
- Yeah.

02:05:18.636 --> 02:05:19.803
But I just want you to know

02:05:19.804 --> 02:05:23.824
that what I said about being
on the road with you, I meant.

02:05:23.933 --> 02:05:26.110
Connecting.

02:05:26.978 --> 02:05:28.645
I like having you for my brother.

02:05:28.646 --> 02:05:31.414
I'm an excellent driver.

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:34.997
Yes, you are.

02:06:01.596 --> 02:06:04.273
I like having you
for my big brother.

02:06:06.851 --> 02:06:08.652
Yeah.

02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:25.468
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

02:06:28.456 --> 02:06:31.600
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

02:06:32.168 --> 02:06:34.220
Main man.

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.287
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:13.583
<i>Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound,</i>

02:07:13.584 --> 02:07:16.461
<i>now boarding, track number three.</i>

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:17.671
<i>Fullerton, San Bernardino.</i> ..

02:07:17.672 --> 02:07:19.297
Ray.

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:24.524
<i>...Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.</i>

02:07:30.393 --> 02:07:32.936
- Hello, Charlie. Hello, Raymond.
- Dr. Bruner.

02:07:32.937 --> 02:07:36.356
Wouldn't you feel a little more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?

02:07:36.357 --> 02:07:38.066
- Tell him, Ray.
- Kmart sucks.

02:07:38.067 --> 02:07:39.234
I see.

02:07:39.235 --> 02:07:43.738
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

02:07:43.739 --> 02:07:45.365
Why don't you take a
couple of minutes?

02:07:45.366 --> 02:07:47.509
See you, Charlie.

02:07:48.411 --> 02:07:50.884
- You made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:58.253
I guess I better give this to you.

02:07:58.254 --> 02:08:01.398
You're gonna have to
carry this now, it's...

02:08:01.591 --> 02:08:04.769
It's got your cheese
balls, your apple juice,

02:08:04.969 --> 02:08:07.095
notebooks, pens and...

02:08:07.096 --> 02:08:09.598
"Who's on First"
video that you like.

02:08:09.599 --> 02:08:11.433
"Who's on First." Very funny.

02:08:11.434 --> 02:08:12.976
I told you it's funny.

02:08:12.977 --> 02:08:14.949
Board!

02:08:15.104 --> 02:08:16.229
Better get going.

02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:17.564
Yeah. Very shiny train.

02:08:17.565 --> 02:08:19.992
Yeah, it sure is.

02:08:20.234 --> 02:08:23.278
Listen, Ray, Dr. Bruner
only has custody of you.

02:08:23.279 --> 02:08:26.156
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

02:08:26.157 --> 02:08:29.117
Now, I'm coming to see
you in two weeks.

02:08:29.118 --> 02:08:30.911
How many days is that before
we're gonna be together?

02:08:30.912 --> 02:08:33.246
14 days from today.
Today's Wednesday.

02:08:33.247 --> 02:08:34.623
Hours?

02:08:34.624 --> 02:08:37.083
336 hours.

02:08:37.084 --> 02:08:39.261
Mystifying.

02:08:39.462 --> 02:08:41.630
Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

02:08:41.631 --> 02:08:44.799
1,209,600..

02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:46.968
600 seconds.

02:08:46.969 --> 02:08:48.861
Ray?

02:08:49.764 --> 02:08:51.806
Ray?

02:08:51.807 --> 02:08:53.608
Ray?

02:08:54.352 --> 02:08:56.153
Yeah.

02:09:00.483 --> 02:09:02.317
I'll see you soon.

02:09:02.318 --> 02:09:05.416
Yeah. One for bad, two for good.

02:09:09.075 --> 02:09:12.344
- Bet two for good.
- Yeah.

02:09:22.755 --> 02:09:25.523
Course, three minutes to Wapner.

02:09:25.967 --> 02:09:28.314
You'll make it.

02:09:29.178 --> 02:09:31.230
Yeah.
