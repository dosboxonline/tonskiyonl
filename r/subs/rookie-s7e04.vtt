WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.586
<i>- Previously on "The Rookie."
- Don't puke on him.</i>

00:03.587 --> 00:05.255
This is not my first OD.

00:05.256 --> 00:07.090
I had this girlfriend back
in high school.

00:07.091 --> 00:09.592
I found her after prom
in a bathroom.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.803
Four years ago,
I was diagnosed with cancer.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.596
Given our continued fallout

00:13.597 --> 00:16.599
<i>from the mess Monica
and Blair London created,</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:18.601
Wesley Evers has
been assigned here

00:18.602 --> 00:20.145
to make sure
we're flying right.

00:20.146 --> 00:21.938
<i>How I'm supposed
to work next to Angela Lopez</i>

00:21.939 --> 00:24.107
<i>when all I can think about
is how much I want to--</i>

00:24.108 --> 00:25.775
<i>Malvado is a myth...</i>

00:25.776 --> 00:27.318
The criminal equivalent
of the boogeyman.

00:27.319 --> 00:30.488
Well, apparently, Southern
Front hired him to kill Jason.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.948
We have the same goal.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.284
All you have to do is leave
and your problems go away.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.285
I can't do that.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.624
I know you like oat milk,

00:41.625 --> 00:43.126
but the store was out,
so I got almond.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.127
I hope that's OK.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.964
Ah.
Hello, my beautiful wife.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.507
<i>Hey, I just wanted
to check in</i>

00:49.508 --> 00:52.135
and see how it's going with
my newer replacement model.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.219
Hi, Bailey.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.304
Yeah, Celina
is not a replacement.

00:54.305 --> 00:55.805
She's, uh, bait.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.183
And no one could replace you
because you are awesome.

00:58.184 --> 00:59.476
Thank you.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.311
Now, is this really necessary?

01:01.312 --> 01:04.481
We have U.S. Marshals
watching the house 24/7,

01:04.482 --> 01:07.150
and Jason is being hunted
by a hitman.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.651
Can I please come home?

01:08.652 --> 01:10.653
Yeah, you can 100% come home

01:10.654 --> 01:12.155
if you can look me in the eye
and tell me

01:12.156 --> 01:14.157
that Jason's not
a relentless psychopath

01:14.158 --> 01:15.992
that would risk everything
to get back at you

01:15.993 --> 01:16.993
for betraying him.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.828
OK, fine.
You win.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.497
But I'm climbing
the walls here.

01:20.498 --> 01:22.373
No offense.
- None taken.

01:22.374 --> 01:23.666
I totally get it.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.668
I mean, with Rachel here,
it is a little snug.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.711
Hey.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.338
Oh, so have we had
any movement

01:28.339 --> 01:30.840
on the mystery woman that Jason
is supposedly shacked up with?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.509
No, but given
Jason's history,

01:32.510 --> 01:35.512
I would say she's probably
the lonely, wealthy type.

01:35.513 --> 01:36.846
Yeah, which would
give him the resources

01:36.847 --> 01:38.515
to stay under the radar.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.516
OK.

01:39.517 --> 01:40.683
Well, if I can't come home,

01:40.684 --> 01:42.185
can you please
pack up some of my things

01:42.186 --> 01:43.186
and give them to Lucy?

01:43.187 --> 01:44.187
I'll text you a list.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.355
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

01:45.356 --> 01:46.607
And, uh--

01:47.983 --> 01:49.859
Oh.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.196
Maybe a little later,
we can find some personal time?

01:53.197 --> 01:55.073
There will be
no personal time

01:55.074 --> 01:56.533
until we're in our own bed.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.867
I will have Jason
caught by tonight.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.203
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪</i>

02:00.204 --> 02:03.540
<i>♪ Like I know you
want me to do ♪</i>

02:03.541 --> 02:05.208
Hey, I just want to reiterate

02:05.209 --> 02:07.252
I know what I did last week
was wrong.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.879
And I take no delight
in any of the public fanfare

02:09.880 --> 02:11.714
around my hero moment

02:11.715 --> 02:15.718
that--our--our hero moment
that we had together.

02:15.719 --> 02:20.056
I just--I fell out of my groove
with the whole TO swap thing.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.892
So I'm just--I'm happy
to be back with my OG.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.561
Oh, God.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.229
No one likes a suck-up,
Ridley.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.730
Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.774
Anything you wanna add
to this sad mea culpa?

02:29.775 --> 02:31.734
I'm not looking
for any extra credit, sir.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.236
I just want to be
prepared as possible

02:33.237 --> 02:34.404
for whatever the day holds.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.072
Preparation is
only half the battle.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.782
All I care about is how
you perform on the streets

02:37.783 --> 02:38.908
when your adrenaline's high

02:38.909 --> 02:40.243
and you want to be
an action star.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.619
Yes, sir.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.497
I'll keep the wild horses
locked in the stable, sir.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.749
Check your phone
on your own time, please.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.750
Yes, ma'am.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.588
Oh, wow.
They just keep coming in.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.298
OK, seriously,
what's going on right now?

02:53.299 --> 02:54.757
I--sorry.

02:54.758 --> 02:55.925
I'm just--I'm waiting
on my test results to come in.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.427
I'm a little bit paranoid.

02:57.428 --> 03:00.305
Oh, that's right.
Well, um, did you get any news?

03:00.306 --> 03:01.431
<i>- No.</i>

03:01.432 --> 03:02.765
These are just notifications

03:02.766 --> 03:05.476
that my name is being mentioned
somewhere online.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.437
Are you serious?

03:07.438 --> 03:08.771
Yeah, sorry.
I'll put it away.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.939
Thank you.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.399
<i>
Oh, OK.</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:13.651
Wow. They just--they're good.
They're nice comments.

03:13.652 --> 03:14.944
- Airplane mode.
- Right.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.281
Mr. Evers.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.949
- Welcome back, Wesley.
- Hey.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.120
Sean, hey.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.622
I just wanted to be here
to welcome you back.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.123
The office wasn't
the same without you.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.291
I mean, I'm glad to be back,

03:28.292 --> 03:29.792
as is the entire
Mid-Wilshire Station.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.628
Apparently, they don't
appreciate oversight.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.129
Yeah, well, look,

03:33.130 --> 03:34.964
I'm sure you have a lot
to catch up on,

03:34.965 --> 03:36.507
but the
district attorney election

03:36.508 --> 03:38.635
is right around the corner,
and I just wanted to be sure

03:38.636 --> 03:40.011
I could count
on your endorsement.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.012
Hmm.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.013
Wesley.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.681
Oh, you are aging backwards.

03:43.682 --> 03:44.974
Oh.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.018
I just wanted
to say welcome back

03:47.019 --> 03:49.479
and make sure you're all
squared pen-wise.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.480
Oh, thank you.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.898
Nice try, Vivian.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.983
But you're not going to
buy your way to a win here.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.653
Don't you find an
insecure man such a turnoff?

03:56.654 --> 03:59.822
I am lightyears from insecure.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.659
Anyway, I would
love your endorsement.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.160
- OK.
- OK.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.162
Bye.
-  OK.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.497
You know, in my younger days,

04:07.498 --> 04:09.374
she really would have
gotten under my skin.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.375
Right.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.668
Definitely not now.

04:11.669 --> 04:12.835
No.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.046
Hey, Sean.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.673
You have five minutes
to talk about something

04:16.674 --> 04:19.550
that's been eating away
at the very core of who I am?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.010
Well, that sounds like
it's going to take longer

04:21.011 --> 04:23.012
than five minutes,
but yeah, sure, OK.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.681
Thanks.

04:24.682 --> 04:26.349
You're really the only person
I can talk to about this.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.060
Um...

04:29.061 --> 04:30.853
I heard something
on the Blair London tapes

04:30.854 --> 04:32.730
that has got me spinning.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.399
I thought you turned in
your final report on those.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.192
No, I did.
Uh, it's not criminal.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.194
It's--

04:38.195 --> 04:39.570
you know Keith Graham
from Mid-Wilshire?

04:39.571 --> 04:40.863
Yeah, sure.
He's a great guy.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.198
Annoyingly handsome.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.533
I mean, he's solid detective.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.701
He was seeing Blair?

04:44.702 --> 04:47.203
Yeah, and during
his sessions,

04:47.204 --> 04:51.040
he revealed that
he has recurring...

04:51.041 --> 04:52.709
intimate dreams about Angela.

04:52.710 --> 04:55.878
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.047
Well, look,
you know that legally,

04:58.048 --> 04:59.924
you cannot divulge
any of that to her.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.051
That's a violation
of his privacy.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.386
And that puts the two of them

05:03.387 --> 05:04.887
in an incredibly uncomfortable
position.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.931
I know,
but it's driving me crazy.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.392
Wha--Wes, I--you know.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.435
It seems to me it comes down to

05:10.436 --> 05:13.104
how secure you are
in your marriage.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.939
He's definitely not the first
guy to hit on your hot wife.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.067
He certainly won't be the last.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.069
Wait.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.446
Did you?

05:21.447 --> 05:23.781
I plead the fifth.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.631
All right.
This is not going to be easy.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.926
When the CHP calls
for mutual aid,

05:43.927 --> 05:48.348
usually because things have
gotten messy, even for LA.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.811
Now, wrecks like these
are all about

05:53.812 --> 05:55.438
problem-solving and accuracy.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.940
We have to be exact with
every word in our reports.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.610
Our measurements can't be off,
not even by an inch.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.320
That would mean
a change in liability

06:02.321 --> 06:04.447
and then any half-decent lawyer
could use that

06:04.448 --> 06:06.783
to discredit
our entire investigation.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.117
That's mildly terrifying.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.952
Which is why
I'm making you primary.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.120
What?

06:11.121 --> 06:12.455
Face your fears,
Officer Juarez.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.123
You can handle this.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.291
Tell me you can handle this.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.627
I--I can handle it.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.045
I can handle it.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.298
This is gon' be as fun
as putting socks on a rooster.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.466
Here come the chippies.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.801
He's, like, 50 feet away.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.096
He for sure could have walked.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.973
Afternoon.
Thanks for the assist.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.141
Where do you want us?

06:32.142 --> 06:33.518
Given the circumstances,

06:33.519 --> 06:35.019
we think this should be
an LAPD-led investigation.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.480
- No problem.
- Where will CHP be stationed?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.148
We'll be helping out
at the off-ramp.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.316
Oh.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.859
Over in the shade,

06:41.860 --> 06:43.319
relieving grateful citizens
from bumper-to-bumper traffic?

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
That's nice.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.488
We just want the freeways

06:45.489 --> 06:46.823
up and running
as quickly as possible.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.829
I told Juarez
she's got primary on this.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.038
Bold.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.164
You either want to end
her career right now

06:55.165 --> 06:56.332
or you honestly believe in her.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.875
What do you want us to do?

06:57.876 --> 07:00.545
OK, well, first thing first,
we--we render safety and aid

07:00.546 --> 07:01.838
<i>to all victims.</i>

07:01.839 --> 07:03.840
That means that our number
one priority is--

07:03.841 --> 07:05.883
is clearing a path
for the next ambulance.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.679
<i>I gotta take this.</i>

07:09.680 --> 07:10.930
What's happening?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.723
Were you able to get
that stuff from Lucy?

07:12.724 --> 07:15.059
<i>She was gonna come by here
at lunch and bring it to me.</i>

07:15.060 --> 07:16.227
You forgot.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.687
Yeah, sorry.

07:17.688 --> 07:18.896
<i>This morning's been
just a little chaotic,</i>

07:18.897 --> 07:20.022
<i>but you stay put.</i>

07:20.023 --> 07:21.065
I promise
I'll get it to you tonight

07:21.066 --> 07:22.358
or tomorrow at the latest.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.735
OK, yeah.
Stay safe. I love you.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.863
<i>I love you, too.</i>

07:35.122 --> 07:36.914
How far, Boot?

07:36.915 --> 07:39.250
18.6 feet, sir.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.918
- You sure about that?
- Positive, sir.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.045
Ridley, how far?

07:43.046 --> 07:46.883
Uh, 20--no, that's 20.1--

07:46.884 --> 07:48.885
20.2--it just keeps--
it keeps moving.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.262
I--oh, I have to--
I have to stand still.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.388
Yeah, OK.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.057
20.2.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.559
Hey, what's next?

07:56.560 --> 07:59.562
OK, well, now, I mean,
now you take a million photos.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.397
Just make sure you get
the scene from every angle.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.899
You search the cars

08:02.900 --> 08:05.067
for any open containers,
alcohol, drugs.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.070
If there's any indication
that this is a DUI,

08:08.071 --> 08:09.238
that changes everything.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.406
- OK.
- OK?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.241
<i>OK.</i>

08:16.413 --> 08:17.747
Clear.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.251
Well, hey, hey.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.086
Did you get pictures
from underneath the car

08:24.087 --> 08:25.922
and above as well?
- No.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.423
No, sorry, sorry, it's my bad.
I--

08:27.424 --> 08:28.925
No, listen.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.593
I understand there's a lot
going on right now,

08:30.594 --> 08:33.262
but I can't be holding your
hand every step of the way.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.431
Yeah.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.517
Time to take the training
wheels off there, Ridley.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.105
Can you just lay off?

08:43.106 --> 08:44.774
You have no idea what
anybody's going through, OK?

08:44.775 --> 08:47.443
My girlfriend died in
high school in a car accident,

08:47.444 --> 08:48.778
and this whole
thing is bringing up

08:48.779 --> 08:50.613
a lot of bad memories.
- I'm sorry, dude.

08:50.614 --> 08:51.948
I didn't know.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.700
Just think next time
before you speak, OK?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.119
Officer Penn,
you clear this car?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.621
Yes, sir.
Driver was critical.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.122
Went off in the
first ambulance.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.624
You didn't think
to make note of this?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.126
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.462
I thought we was checking
for beer cans, not firearms.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.630
Back home,
every car you pull over

09:07.631 --> 09:09.632
have a gun in the glove box.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.636
Bag this, please.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.014
- Juarez?
- Yes, sir.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.349
What about this car?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.642
Do we have any information
on this driver?

09:19.643 --> 09:21.310
Uh, no.
Nobody's talked to him yet.

09:21.311 --> 09:25.022
But it is registered
to a Harrison Novak.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.195
Officers!

09:31.196 --> 09:33.656
Double time!

09:33.657 --> 09:35.866
This is the LAPD.
Is anyone in there?

09:35.867 --> 09:38.327
We're going to get you out.
Just hang on.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.331
- Please, please, please.
- Oh, my God.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.583
We need an ambulance!

09:46.753 --> 09:47.878
I'd never seen him before.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.046
But he knew me.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.339
He was waiting.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.383
He called out "Savannah,"
and when I turned,

09:52.384 --> 09:55.344
he sprayed me in the eyes
with something.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.180
It burned really bad.

09:58.181 --> 10:02.184
Um, I tried to run, but, um,
hit me over the head.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.520
And the next thing I knew,

10:04.521 --> 10:07.732
I was tied up in the--
in the trunk.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.900
And we drove around forever.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.361
It felt like hours.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.031
And, uh, he was singing.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.075
He kept replaying
the same dumb pop songs,

10:18.076 --> 10:20.369
singing along
at the top of his lungs

10:20.370 --> 10:21.704
without a care in the world.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.539
Well, you're safe now, OK?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.249
And the good news is
we know who he is.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.044
Officers are kicking down
his door as we speak.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.756
Police!

10:31.757 --> 10:34.050
Harrison Novak, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.384
Ridley.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.238
Clear!

10:56.239 --> 10:57.406
- Clear!
- Clear!

10:57.407 --> 10:58.574
Clear!

11:00.410 --> 11:02.745
This place gives me the creeps.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.413
It feels like teenage girls
live here,

11:04.414 --> 11:05.414
not a 40-year-old dude.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.582
Get used to it.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.917
We're gonna be here
for a minute.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.126
It's the only property
registered in his name.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.753
We need to search every inch
of this place,

11:10.754 --> 11:12.463
so glove up, tear it apart.

11:12.464 --> 11:15.091
Yes, sir.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.926
How bad?

11:16.927 --> 11:18.094
Physically, she should be OK.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.261
Guy nabbed her out in public

11:19.262 --> 11:21.097
and kept her in a trunk
for hours.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.932
Being a woman
is consistently terrifying.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.600
Then you have a daughter
and it only gets worse.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.103
Harrison Novak was
arrested three years ago

11:27.104 --> 11:28.437
for burglary and assault.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.773
He broke into a woman's home
and choked her.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.942
It seemed open-and-shut,
but evidence was compromised,

11:32.943 --> 11:34.985
and the prosecution
lost the case at trial

11:34.986 --> 11:36.612
to Novak's hotshot lawyer.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.781
Who the hell was that?

11:38.782 --> 11:39.782
Your husband.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.991
Yeah, I recognize the case.

11:40.992 --> 11:41.992
The cops screwed up
the chain of evidence,

11:41.993 --> 11:43.619
and I got him acquitted.
Why?

11:43.620 --> 11:45.788
<i>We found a girl in his trunk
in pretty bad shape.</i>

11:45.789 --> 11:47.373
<i>He's currently at large,</i>

11:47.374 --> 11:49.333
<i>so if you can give us
anything that might help.</i>

11:49.334 --> 11:52.336
Uh, I'll pull his file
and get it to you ASAP.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.296
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.506
<i>Thanks.</i>

11:57.968 --> 11:59.844
Do you remember
the Harrison Novak case?

11:59.845 --> 12:01.137
Uh, yeah, of course.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.680
That's the only time
I lost a trial.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.141
Why?
- Novak just abducted a woman.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.143
Maybe not the first.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.853
Well, that's not good.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.312
For either of us.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.606
Huh.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.989
Hey, I'm sorry again
for not reporting the gun.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.324
But I did find out the owner
had purchased it legally,

12:22.325 --> 12:23.492
and it was registered.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.493
That's not the point.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.828
Cars are frequently broken into

12:25.829 --> 12:28.330
by criminals who do not have
a license to carry.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.498
A weapon not registered to them

12:29.499 --> 12:30.833
is a win for
the criminal community.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.169
Understood.
It won't happen again.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.670
You know what?
I'm going to recommend

12:34.671 --> 12:36.839
you undergo additional training
and testing all weekend,

12:36.840 --> 12:38.174
plus an additional
three hours a day

12:38.175 --> 12:39.341
for the next two weeks.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.010
What? It was--
it was a simple mistake!

12:41.011 --> 12:42.678
Look, if I can't trust you
to clock loaded weapons

12:42.679 --> 12:45.140
in plain sight, what else
can't I trust you with?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.452
- What's wrong?
- I lost her.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.871
She left the apartment.
I got blocked in by a truck.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.331
<i>Hello?</i>

13:10.332 --> 13:12.249
<i>
- Come on, come on.</i>

13:12.250 --> 13:13.876
<i>- ♪ With a boom and a bang ♪</i>

13:15.378 --> 13:16.754
<i>♪ There it goes ♪</i>

13:16.755 --> 13:18.047
<i>- Hi, please leave me--</i>
- She's ducking my call.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.882
But you can track her phone, right?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.550
<i>♪ Threw it all away ♪</i>

13:25.096 --> 13:27.890
<i>♪ Come on, let's get it
started, started, ooh ♪</i>

13:29.226 --> 13:31.227
She's headed towards
Echo Park, the firehouse.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.394
Punch it.

13:36.775 --> 13:40.736
Oh.
This guy's totally a psycho.

13:40.737 --> 13:45.741
He wore his outside shoes
right in the bedroom.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.910
Wait, these things gotta
be caked in evidence, right?

13:47.911 --> 13:51.789
Potentially.
Take a photo and then bag them.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.749
Hey, uh, Ridley,
can I ask you a question

13:53.750 --> 13:56.252
about something from earlier?

13:56.253 --> 13:58.420
Yeah, that's not really
my favorite way

13:58.421 --> 14:00.089
to start a conversation,
but sure.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.758
A few weeks ago, you told me
that your girlfriend overdosed.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.427
And then earlier, I swear I
thought I heard you tell Miles

14:05.428 --> 14:06.762
that she died
in a car accident?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.264
Yeah.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.432
Sorry, I should have
made that more clear.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.601
Sarah didn't actually die
from the OD.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.061
We got super-lucky.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.772
My friend's dad, he's a doctor,
and--and he came home

14:16.773 --> 14:18.649
just in time with some
naloxone.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.484
And then she died
in a car accident?

14:20.485 --> 14:23.279
No, that was a different
girlfriend a year later.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.488
Savannah wasn't a one-off.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.950
I found this hidden
in the hallway closet.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.618
Oh, my God.

14:31.788 --> 14:32.788
More victims.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.132
Hello?
- Hey, counselor.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.300
Harrison Novak.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.803
<i>You helped me out of a jam
a few years ago.</i>

14:47.804 --> 14:48.971
Of course.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.139
Uh, I'm just finishing up
a meeting.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.140
Can I call you right back?

14:51.141 --> 14:52.641
That's OK. I can hold.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.642
<i>I got time.</i>

14:55.145 --> 14:56.145
I've got Harrison Novak
on the phone.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.313
He wants me to represent him.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.772
What's my ethical obligation
here?

14:58.773 --> 15:00.316
Do I have to tell him I'm
no longer a defense attorney?

15:00.317 --> 15:02.484
Uh, no but as a prosecutor,
the only thing you can't do

15:02.485 --> 15:03.527
is agree to represent him.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.820
Other than that,
you can tell him

15:04.821 --> 15:06.488
anything he needs to hear
to keep him on the line.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.865
- OK.
- Angela, it's Del Monte.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.158
Got your husband here.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.826
He's talking to Novak on
his cell phone right now.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.828
Hot damn.
Setting up a trace now.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.496
OK, I'm putting
you on speaker.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.666
Wesley, just keep him
talking as long as you can.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.335
I'll mute my phone
so we can listen.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.878
All right, great.
I'm going over to him now.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.506
Sorry to keep you waiting.
How can I help?

15:24.507 --> 15:26.342
No problem. Look,
I know you're a very busy guy,

15:26.343 --> 15:28.344
so I will skip the foreplay.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.679
I was super impressed
with how you handled my case

15:30.680 --> 15:33.515
back in the day,
and I find myself

15:33.516 --> 15:35.893
in a bit
of fresh legal jeopardy.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.519
How bad are we talking?

15:37.520 --> 15:40.022
See, I don't like to
use that word "bad."

15:40.023 --> 15:42.024
So judgy.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.692
<i>Good, bad, right, wrong.</i>

15:43.693 --> 15:46.862
They're all just choices and
decisions repressed people use

15:46.863 --> 15:50.240
to keep more free-thinking
individuals in a box.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.034
Right, well,
I wasn't trying to judge.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.702
I just need to know
a little more

15:53.703 --> 15:55.371
of what I'm getting into
before I commit.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.705
<i>Well, I can tell
you this much.</i>

15:56.706 --> 15:59.541
Most people might not like
what I do, who I am,

15:59.542 --> 16:02.211
but everyone inflicts
and contributes

16:02.212 --> 16:04.213
to some level of pain
and suffering.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.049
<i>You might step on a bug
or cook a steak.</i>

16:07.050 --> 16:09.885
I just do my version of that.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.596
Only on a bigger,
more connected level with...

16:12.597 --> 16:14.223
larger and more conscious
animals.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.557
Are you saying
you've killed people?

16:15.558 --> 16:17.101
Are you saying
you're my lawyer?

16:17.102 --> 16:18.602
Mr. Novak,
I'm just trying to make sure

16:18.603 --> 16:19.937
we're both on the same page.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.230
This is taking longer than
I'd wanted,

16:21.231 --> 16:22.898
and I have a bit
of a ticking clock problem.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.733
<i>I had wanted to achieve
so much more</i>

16:24.734 --> 16:26.068
<i>by the end of my story,</i>

16:26.069 --> 16:28.737
a certain number
of accomplishments,

16:28.738 --> 16:30.572
to make the world take notice.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.409
So now I find myself having to
get into the volume business.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.912
Wait, um, why don't we get
together in person and discuss?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.205
I gotta go.
But don't worry.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.915
You'll probably see me
later tonight on your TV.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.583
- Wait!
- Ciao for now.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.253
Please tell me
you got a location.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.796
He's calling
from Sorority Row.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.215
He's going to pull a Ted Bundy.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.925
<i>I'm sending every cop
in the city,</i>

16:49.926 --> 16:51.635
<i>but I'm not sure we're going
to make it there in time.</i>

16:51.636 --> 16:53.680
Say a prayer.

17:22.292 --> 17:23.459
Who is it?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.502
Hi, uh, Melanie?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.297
I think I have your package.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.132
It got delivered
to my place by mistake.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.012
For you.
- Thanks so much.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.138
Oh!

17:54.240 --> 17:56.325
Police!

18:00.330 --> 18:01.497
Please step away!

18:01.498 --> 18:02.498
Ah!

18:08.505 --> 18:10.672
Back up!
I got him!

18:14.010 --> 18:15.511
Everybody OK?

18:15.512 --> 18:17.846
If any of you ladies are
looking to join the LAPD,

18:17.847 --> 18:19.515
I'd like to offer a
letter of recommendation

18:19.516 --> 18:21.601
written by me personally.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.698
Get back.
This is a crime scene.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.200
Let me through.
I'm with the DA's office.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.535
I need to get in there.
- I said back up.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.619
- Angela! Angela!
- Hold on.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.412
Stand down.
He's allowed to be here.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.706
Hey, what happened in there?
Please tell me no one's dead.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.874
No one is dead.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.043
In fact, he got his ass kicked.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.753
Hey, it's OK.

18:49.754 --> 18:50.754
You did good.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.048
You're the reason
we got this guy.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.383
I'm also the reason
that he's been free

18:54.384 --> 18:56.051
to kill innocent women
for the past three years.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.553
His actions are
not your fault.

18:57.554 --> 18:58.929
You were just doing your job.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.722
OK.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.099
Hey.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.434
Thought you were too busy
for me.

19:04.435 --> 19:05.561
You change your mind?

19:05.562 --> 19:07.271
I'm not a defense lawyer
anymore.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.397
I'm a prosecutor now.

19:08.398 --> 19:09.773
Tricky.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.441
That's how the cops
got here so quick.

19:11.442 --> 19:12.734
Yeah, you're lucky we did.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.570
Those girls were
about to kill you.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.113
Get in.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.948
We should get him back to the
station as soon as possible.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.575
He is a talker.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.909
Yeah, go.
I'll be fine.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.744
- You sure?
- Yeah.

19:22.745 --> 19:23.997
Go.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.747
Hmm.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.305
<i>♪ Roses are red ♪</i>

19:41.306 --> 19:44.933
<i>♪ Diamonds are shining,
it's on now ♪</i>

19:44.934 --> 19:47.936
<i>♪ Rolling in dice ♪</i>

19:47.937 --> 19:51.607
<i>♪ It's the luck of draw,
yeah, it's all right ♪</i>

19:51.608 --> 19:54.818
<i>♪ Don't be afraid ♪</i>

19:54.819 --> 19:57.030
<i>♪ We've got all of the joy-- ♪</i>

20:03.244 --> 20:05.287
Put your hands on the wheel!

20:05.288 --> 20:08.624
I'm impressed.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.334
Like I care.
Who are you?

20:10.335 --> 20:11.960
Why are you following me?

20:11.961 --> 20:13.128
Did Jason send you?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.338
No.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.966
I'm the man hunting
your ex-husband.

20:17.967 --> 20:18.967
Malvado.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.802
I'm not your enemy.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.346
We want the same thing.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.973
Jason dead.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.476
You're a wanted man.
I should call 911.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.852
Go ahead.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.520
Have me arrested.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.357
And spend the rest of your life
worrying about Jason.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.318
Or you could let me go

20:36.319 --> 20:40.239
and never have
to worry about him again.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.287
May I?

20:54.128 --> 20:57.172
This number cannot be traced.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.174
But messages
will get back to me.

20:59.175 --> 21:03.345
If you hear of Jason's
whereabouts, let me know.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.848
And I will put an end
to your nightmare.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.371
Hey, you OK?

21:29.372 --> 21:30.872
Hey. Yeah, I'm fine.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.207
What were you thinking?

21:32.208 --> 21:35.210
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this was?

21:35.211 --> 21:37.379
Oh, look,
my phone is ringing.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.381
The idea was that
you stay in the apartment.

21:39.382 --> 21:40.882
All of a sudden,
I got marshals

21:40.883 --> 21:42.551
blowing up my phone
telling me you've gone missing?

21:42.552 --> 21:43.885
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.721
Wait, how is it the Marshals
know I left?

21:45.722 --> 21:47.222
Are they tracking my phone?

21:47.223 --> 21:49.057
We had a guy posted
outside Lucy's apartment.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.225
To spy on me?

21:50.226 --> 21:51.810
To protect you.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.895
In case Jason saw through the
ruse and went after you there.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.564
Can we get back in the shop, please?

21:55.565 --> 21:56.565
Why didn't you tell me?

21:56.566 --> 21:57.983
That's not the point.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.402
What were you even doing
down here in the first place?

22:00.403 --> 22:02.404
It doesn't matter.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.077
<i>Before we get started,</i>

22:09.078 --> 22:10.912
I'd like to get us
on the same page

22:10.913 --> 22:14.082
as to how we speak
to each other.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.585
I mean, we may have...

22:16.586 --> 22:18.086
well, differing philosophies,

22:18.087 --> 22:21.757
but it doesn't mean we can't
be cordial to one another.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.259
You don't make
the rules here.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.428
I think I kind of do.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.764
I mean, you must have a lot
of very distressed families

22:28.765 --> 22:31.266
who are desperate for answers.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.769
And I am willing
to tell you everything.

22:33.770 --> 22:37.147
But I expect to be treated
like a person, not a monster.

22:37.148 --> 22:38.940
Sure, we can do that.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.650
We will just listen.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.361
Whatever you want to tell us.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.447
These on?

22:45.448 --> 22:47.033
Yes, you're being recorded.

22:50.703 --> 22:56.124
It's not the killing.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.293
You'd think it would be.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.004
It's the least
interesting part.

23:01.005 --> 23:05.634
The anticipation,
the planning...

23:05.635 --> 23:07.803
That puts a wind in my sails.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.639
The killing itself is
more like eating for me.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.642
Necessary, but...

23:13.643 --> 23:19.481
not as holistically stimulating
as the lead-up.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.983
Now...

23:21.984 --> 23:26.488
hunting my victims,

23:26.489 --> 23:29.491
really feeling their fear...

23:31.828 --> 23:34.663
That just...

23:34.664 --> 23:37.707
fills me up.

23:37.708 --> 23:41.378
When the killing's done,
I tend to feel a little...

23:41.379 --> 23:45.340
empty inside, lonely even.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.385
So then, I...

23:48.386 --> 23:49.678
have to do it again.

23:49.679 --> 23:53.348
These are human beings
you are talking about.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.350
You don't feel any
kind of remorse?

23:55.351 --> 23:58.186
Do you feel remorse when
you eat a burger?

23:58.187 --> 24:00.021
What did you do
with the bodies?

24:00.022 --> 24:01.064
Buried them.

24:01.065 --> 24:04.734
Where?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.194
How about I show you?

24:11.617 --> 24:13.535
All right, you can stay here
till the end of shift,

24:13.536 --> 24:15.370
and then Lucy will be here

24:15.371 --> 24:17.539
to bring you back
to her apartment.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.041
I'm your wife, John.
I don't work for you.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.209
And in case you've forgotten,

24:21.210 --> 24:22.878
I literally spent
the last three weeks

24:22.879 --> 24:25.213
doing tactical military
training in Germany.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.215
I don't need you to protect me.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.718
Nolan, Novak gave up
the location of his dump site.

24:29.719 --> 24:30.886
Units on their way.

24:30.887 --> 24:31.928
I need you guys
to meet them there.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.722
Right,
um, we'll finish this later.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.890
- Mm-hmm.
- Promise.

24:34.891 --> 24:37.310
Uh, would you watch her, please?

24:39.228 --> 24:40.270
You're a grown-ass woman.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.730
I'm not babysitting you.
- Thank you.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.974
Hey.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.267
Hey there.

25:19.268 --> 25:20.810
You really want to be
shooting from that side.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.270
I'm completely backlit.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.605
And no offense, but if
you want to have an easy time

25:23.606 --> 25:25.607
selling the doc to Hulu
or whatever,

25:25.608 --> 25:28.777
<i>you want to see my face
and not the, you know,</i>

25:28.778 --> 25:30.278
random cops.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.613
That's what people
actually care about.

25:33.616 --> 25:36.618
Hey, we got something.

25:36.619 --> 25:40.956
<i>♪ Your painted face
take extra care ♪</i>

25:40.957 --> 25:44.292
<i>♪ Careful not
to breathe the air ♪</i>

25:44.293 --> 25:48.296
<i>♪ A silver-tongued shadow ♪</i>

25:48.297 --> 25:51.967
<i>♪ A vulgar infection ♪</i>

25:51.968 --> 25:55.637
<i>♪ A silver-tongued creature ♪</i>

25:56.681 --> 25:58.473
<i>♪ This self-deception ♪</i>

26:03.813 --> 26:04.980
Where are they going?

26:04.981 --> 26:07.816
I don't know.

26:07.817 --> 26:10.986
I didn't bury anyone
over there.

26:24.667 --> 26:27.002
They're all wrapped the same.
They <i>must</i> be yours.

26:27.003 --> 26:30.380
I swear to God,
all my kills are back there.

26:30.381 --> 26:33.842
These aren't mine.

26:37.847 --> 26:40.015
I'm gonna have nightmares
about that burial site.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.850
Shouldn't I be
more hardened by now?

26:41.851 --> 26:43.685
I--I should, right?

26:43.686 --> 26:45.353
No, your empathy
is your best quality.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.689
Really?
<i>Best</i> quality?

26:47.690 --> 26:49.691
Well, there
are certain others.

26:49.692 --> 26:52.527
Best discussed in
a non-professional setting.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.364
- Thanks for coming right over.
- Yeah, of course.

26:56.365 --> 26:57.866
- You saw the bodies?
- Yes.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.034
We didn't unwrap any of them

26:59.035 --> 27:01.202
for fear of
compromising DNA evidence.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.913
They're all being sent to
our morgue facility downtown.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.749
Give us the room, guys.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.584
Hey.
Good to see you again.

27:07.585 --> 27:08.710
Likewise.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.086
Wish it was
over a caffé americano,

27:10.087 --> 27:11.087
but here we are.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.088
Hi, nice to see you.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.214
Uh, who wants to start?

27:13.215 --> 27:14.215
I will.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.800
As I told Garza,

27:15.801 --> 27:17.886
it seems clear that we have a
second serial killer at large.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.430
Harrison Novak has been
falling all over himself

27:20.431 --> 27:22.098
to take credit for his kills,

27:22.099 --> 27:24.559
but he seemed genuinely shocked
when we uncovered those bodies.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.102
You think he knows who
the second killer is?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.395
Maybe, but it feels unlikely.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.605
I agree with Nyla.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.398
Novak seemed totally thrown
by the bodies

27:30.399 --> 27:33.401
and worried that this killer
would somehow overshadow him.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.403
OK, so what's our first step?

27:35.404 --> 27:38.239
Mine is a thorough
examination of all the victims,

27:38.240 --> 27:39.949
which will take days,
if not weeks.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.743
In the short-term,
we need to try to figure out

27:41.744 --> 27:43.411
a connection
between the two killers.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.246
Well, let's say
Harper's intuition is right,

27:45.247 --> 27:48.083
and Novak doesn't know the
identity of the second killer.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.709
I mean,
it can't be a coincidence

27:49.710 --> 27:54.422
that number two used the same
green tarp to bury his victims.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.758
He's clearly piggybacking off
of Novak's burial site, right?

27:56.759 --> 27:58.593
Which would indicate
that killer number two

27:58.594 --> 28:01.471
is trying to hide his crimes
inside Novak's.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.264
Which is the complete
opposite of Harrison Novak,

28:03.265 --> 28:06.101
a killer who's desperate
for recognition.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.770
How did number two know about
the burial site?

28:08.771 --> 28:10.605
I mean, they must have
crossed paths somewhere, right?

28:10.606 --> 28:12.232
Theoretically,

28:12.233 --> 28:13.566
but without even the slightest
hint of where to start looking,

28:13.567 --> 28:15.110
we're talking about
an infinitely large haystack

28:15.111 --> 28:16.277
hiding a very small needle.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.779
I hope I'm not interrupting,

28:17.780 --> 28:19.948
but I might have a smaller
haystack for you to search.

28:19.949 --> 28:21.783
I dug through my notes from
the Harrison Novak case file.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.785
When we first met, he mentioned
that he had spent some time

28:23.786 --> 28:25.286
in a psychiatric facility.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.621
That wasn't in this file.

28:26.622 --> 28:27.789
Well, he was 15.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.124
Voluntary admission,
not criminal.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.459
- Which facility?
- Westview, out in Chatsworth.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.294
We've been there before.
Director's a pill.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.462
We'll go talk to her.

28:34.463 --> 28:35.964
Do you mind
expediting a warrant?

28:35.965 --> 28:37.465
She's not going to give us
anything unless she has to.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.300
Yeah, consider it done.

28:39.301 --> 28:42.303
You do know not everyone
suffering from mental illness

28:42.304 --> 28:43.638
is a serial killer?

28:43.639 --> 28:45.473
Of course,
but we did just arrest one,

28:45.474 --> 28:48.643
and he was treated
at this facility 15 years ago.

28:48.644 --> 28:49.811
So we're not just here
because we heard

28:49.812 --> 28:51.855
how personable the staff is.

28:51.856 --> 28:54.023
Yeah, listen, we know that
this is a sensitive subject,

28:54.024 --> 28:57.193
but most serial killers suffer
from some sort of psychosis

28:57.194 --> 28:59.320
or antisocial
personality disorder.

28:59.321 --> 29:03.491
Nice. Which Psychology 101
book did you pull that from?

29:03.492 --> 29:05.702
I'm about to put her in
a different kind of hospital.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.162
With all due respect,

29:07.163 --> 29:09.497
we just pulled more than
a dozen bodies out of a field.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.000
And now we have a court order
for your patient records.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.002
Either you give us access
to those records now

29:14.003 --> 29:17.672
or later, after you've spent
the weekend in jail.

29:17.673 --> 29:20.049
Are you aware of people
suffering from mental illness

29:20.050 --> 29:22.677
are actually more likely to be
<i>victims</i> of violent crime?

29:22.678 --> 29:25.221
Yes, but that's not relevant
at this moment.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.182
So are you going to give us
the list of patients and staff

29:27.183 --> 29:29.851
who were here with Novak
or not?

29:29.852 --> 29:32.187
It'll take a while
to assemble.

29:32.188 --> 29:33.855
You have 12 hours.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.524
And we don't do grace periods.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.859
I really thought you were
going to hurt her there

29:37.860 --> 29:39.569
for a minute.
- Me, too.

29:39.570 --> 29:42.197
And you weren't exactly
playing good cop either.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.782
Whatever gets the job done.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.209
What?

29:57.713 --> 29:59.380
Same green tarp?
You wanna go in?

29:59.381 --> 30:02.050
As opposed to calling in
100 cops to do it for us?

30:02.051 --> 30:04.886
No guts, no glory.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.766
Control,
this is Detective Lopez.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.060
Harper and I are code six
on a follow-up

30:12.061 --> 30:13.895
at Westview
Psychiatric Hospital.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.064
Start up another unit in case
we come across anything.

30:16.065 --> 30:17.732
<i>Copy that, Detective.</i>

30:38.170 --> 30:41.256
You ready?

30:41.257 --> 30:42.757
Ready.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.437
Ugh.

30:56.438 --> 30:57.814
You OK?

30:57.815 --> 31:01.527
Yeah, I'm just regretting
my choice of footwear.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.448
I can't believe they still
have all this equipment.

31:07.449 --> 31:08.658
You never know
when lobotomies

31:08.659 --> 31:10.703
will come back in style.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.383
There's something
written here.

31:26.719 --> 31:27.969
Maybe from an old patient?

31:37.646 --> 31:39.480
I feel like I've seen
this movie before.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.317
Yeah, but they
didn't have guns.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.487
Control, the situation
is escalating.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.323
Attach a few more units.
Code three.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.325
<i>Copy that, Detective.</i>

31:56.165 --> 31:59.834
I am starting to regret more
than just my shoe choice.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.502
No guts, no glory, remember?

32:01.503 --> 32:04.505
That's not fair,
using my bravada against me.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.177
Police!

32:23.317 --> 32:26.027
Stop!
Police!

32:28.030 --> 32:31.199
Help me.
He's coming back!

32:31.200 --> 32:32.867
You have to get me out of here.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.243
He's going to kill us.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.204
Are there others?
Does he have someone else?

32:36.205 --> 32:37.705
I don't know.
Please!

32:37.706 --> 32:38.873
He needs medical attention
now.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.208
All right.
Go get him to safety.

32:40.209 --> 32:41.376
I got this guy.

32:41.377 --> 32:43.252
Come on.

34:16.805 --> 34:19.307
Oh, my legs.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.516
My legs.

34:35.157 --> 34:36.157
Nyla!

34:36.158 --> 34:37.992
Here.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.076
Are you OK?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.370
No.
He injected me with something.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.331
I can't feel my legs.

34:43.332 --> 34:44.499
OK, hang on.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.833
There's an ambulance
on the way.

34:45.834 --> 34:46.876
This is Lopez.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.836
Officer down,
Westview basement.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.671
Conscious and breathing,
but injected with some type

34:50.672 --> 34:52.548
of paralytic
and can't move her legs.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.509
We need those EMTs
down here now.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.052
<i>Copy that, Detective.
They're on the way.</i>

34:56.053 --> 34:57.345
It's going to be OK.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.358
- How you doing?
- Better.

35:10.359 --> 35:11.859
Feeling is mostly back.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.029
My best guess
is short-term paralytic.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.031
I'm just trying not
to think too hard about

35:17.032 --> 35:19.367
how dirty all the needles were
down there.

35:19.368 --> 35:21.035
Probably for the best.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.203
Any sign of our suspect?

35:22.204 --> 35:24.539
No.
He clearly had an escape route.

35:24.540 --> 35:28.042
Psych hospital just sent the
list of patients and employees.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.211
It's a lot of names.
The FBI is digging in.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.712
How's the guy we
pulled out of there?

35:31.713 --> 35:34.215
Remy Darden?

35:34.216 --> 35:35.758
He's in rough shape.

35:35.759 --> 35:38.553
Hopefully he's stable enough
in the morning to talk to us.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.596
And James will be here soon.
- Mm.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.723
I didn't tell him what
really happened,

35:42.724 --> 35:44.934
just that you suffered
a minor injury on the job.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.770
Thanks.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.605
You wanna talk about
how scary that was?

35:49.606 --> 35:51.232
Nope.

35:51.233 --> 35:52.233
You want a hug?

35:52.234 --> 35:53.485
No.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.238
Yes.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.753

36:16.258 --> 36:17.800
Yes, sir.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.969
I got a call from Detroit PD.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.262
They pulled prints

36:21.263 --> 36:22.471
from a liquor store robbery
last night.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.764
Were they Pete's?
They were--

36:23.765 --> 36:24.932
they were Pete's, weren't they?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.435
Jason Wyler's.

36:27.436 --> 36:28.436
Detroit, Michigan?

36:28.437 --> 36:30.146
I ran the VICAP search.

36:30.147 --> 36:31.981
There was another hit
on Jason's prints

36:31.982 --> 36:33.941
two days before
outside of Provo.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.943
Looks like Malvado's
got him spooked.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.486
He's been heading east,

36:37.487 --> 36:39.447
getting as far away from LA
as he can.

36:39.448 --> 36:41.616
I'm a little surprised he
picked survival over revenge,

36:41.617 --> 36:42.783
but I'll--I'll take it.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.619
I gave Detroit PD your info.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.621
They'll call if they
have anything more.

36:46.622 --> 36:48.122
Thank you, sir.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.665
Hold up.
One more thing.

36:49.666 --> 36:52.460
Uh, I've been overprotective,

36:52.461 --> 36:54.962
and if Bailey divorces me,
no one will blame her.

36:54.963 --> 36:58.341
If I'm in your shoes,
I'm just as crazed.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.968
But you have

Uh, home feels like the wrong
answer, but I'm not sure why?

37:14.691 --> 37:17.026
Sawed-off shotgun, dagger,
nunchucks, AR-15--

37:17.027 --> 37:18.819
which two violate
the same penal code?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.029
We doing this now?

37:20.030 --> 37:21.155
You need to know the law cold

37:21.156 --> 37:22.406
no matter how tired you are,

37:22.407 --> 37:23.824
no matter how many
other things are going on.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.826
Right.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.996
Sawed-off shotgun and dagger,
violation of 12020,

37:28.997 --> 37:30.331
possession of an
illegal weapon.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.499
What about nunchucks?

37:31.500 --> 37:33.000
Formerly a violation
of 12020,

37:33.001 --> 37:35.169
but currently
no violation at all.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.838
They became legal in 2023.

37:37.839 --> 37:38.839
Good.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.007
You're dismissed.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.010
Sergeant, I appreciate it.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.345
How hard you are on me

37:44.346 --> 37:45.846
and how dedicated you are
to doing the job right.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.181
And I swear I'm not kissing up.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.599
Where I'm from,

37:48.600 --> 37:50.518
a lot of cops don't have
that same level of diligence.

37:50.519 --> 37:53.521
Some are transplants who had
failed from other departments.

37:53.522 --> 37:55.856
They didn't care
the way you do.

37:55.857 --> 37:56.857
And I guess I didn't
really understand

37:56.858 --> 37:58.025
how much I had to learn.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.528
So thank you.

38:00.529 --> 38:01.904

38:16.211 --> 38:18.212
I'm not to blame
for Novak's crimes,

38:18.213 --> 38:21.549
but emotionally,
I'm struggling.

38:21.550 --> 38:23.718
Well, you're not a robot,
Wes.

38:23.719 --> 38:25.886
I mean, I would actually
be more concerned

38:25.887 --> 38:27.763
if you felt nothing
after all this.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.890
But on the bright side,
at least you've forgotten

38:29.891 --> 38:32.268
about the detective who has
the hots for your wife, right?

38:32.269 --> 38:33.436
Well,
now I'm thinking about him.

38:33.437 --> 38:34.895
Anyway--

38:34.896 --> 38:36.230
What is this?

38:36.231 --> 38:38.733
You're having a wake
for Sean's political career

38:38.734 --> 38:39.942
and didn't invite me?

38:39.943 --> 38:41.402
I made a sound only
a bat could hear.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.611
I figured that
would do the trick.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.071
Oh!

38:44.072 --> 38:46.782
It is so nice to see you
retain your sense of humor

38:46.783 --> 38:48.284
given the end of your campaign.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.285
Huh.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.911
I mean, who would elect a DA

38:50.912 --> 38:51.912
who was so instrumental

38:51.913 --> 38:53.581
in letting a serial killer
go free?

38:53.582 --> 38:55.291
OK, you and I both know

38:55.292 --> 38:57.918
that what happened is far more
complicated than that.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.420
Of course.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.756
But voters don't
do complicated.

39:01.757 --> 39:04.592
You should withdraw before you
get embarrassed at the polls.

39:04.593 --> 39:05.968
Mm-hmm.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.136
Really nice to have you back.

39:07.137 --> 39:08.346
Mm.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.349
She's lovely.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.771
<i>Third down and three
inside the 25-yard line...</i>

39:20.942 --> 39:22.777
Stay.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.279
Hey.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.947
Um, how much do you trust
the LAPD background checks?

39:26.948 --> 39:29.116
I'm sorry, why are you
at my door asking me that?

39:29.117 --> 39:30.284
Come on.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.952
OK, so Seth told me that

39:31.953 --> 39:33.788
his high school girlfriend
died of an OD,

39:33.789 --> 39:36.791
but then he told Miles that
she died in a car accident.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.292
I confronted him about it.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.502
He covered it pretty well,

39:39.503 --> 39:40.836
said that they were
different girlfriends.

39:40.837 --> 39:43.839
But I--that--
that seems pretty unlikely.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.965
I just can't shake this feeling

39:44.966 --> 39:46.467
that there's
something off with him.

39:46.468 --> 39:48.636
Look, our background checks
are pretty invasive.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.513
And he would have had
to pass a polygraph test,

39:50.514 --> 39:53.182
which we both know
those are illuminating.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.810
If he was hiding something,
I think it would have come out.

39:55.811 --> 39:56.977
Yeah, you're right.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.145
But you're still
not satisfied?

39:58.146 --> 40:01.315
No, I--

40:01.316 --> 40:03.235
I'm sorry.
I--OK.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.194
Oh.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.487
Oh, my gosh.

40:06.488 --> 40:08.573
Hey, Kojo.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.325
You like a butt scratch?

40:11.326 --> 40:12.993

40:12.994 --> 40:14.328

40:18.834 --> 40:20.042
Look, I know it's late,

40:20.043 --> 40:21.502
and I don't have much
in the way of food,

40:21.503 --> 40:24.171
but I could order something.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.549
Uh...

40:26.550 --> 40:28.175
oh.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.012
No.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.514
No, I should, um--

40:33.515 --> 40:37.560
I'm gonna go,
and so have a good night.

40:37.561 --> 40:39.186
- You, too.
- Yeah.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.688
OK.
Yeah.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.035
I'm happy to come back
whenever you need me.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.705
Thank you.
I think, though, we're all set.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.874

40:59.875 --> 41:01.584
Mm,

41:03.753 --> 41:05.379

41:06.923 --> 41:08.341
See you soon.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.556
I am sorry.

41:15.557 --> 41:18.893
I am sorry for treating you
like a damsel in distress

41:18.894 --> 41:21.061

41:21.062 --> 41:23.731
You are strong, you are smart,

41:23.732 --> 41:29.069

of handling yourself.

41:29.070 --> 41:31.572
Sometimes it's just

41:31.573 --> 41:33.908
hard to figure out what help
you need from me.

41:33.909 --> 41:36.410
Well, I knew you were
coming from a good place.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.828
I just--

41:37.829 --> 41:40.414
in the future, I recommend
asking instead of telling.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.250
Agreed.
Let me try.

41:43.251 --> 41:47.254
Would you care to spend some
quality personal time with me

41:47.255 --> 41:50.424
in our quality personal bed?

41:50.425 --> 41:51.759
Perfect.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.971
I'm just gonna get us a water,
you know, for after.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.683
Excellent.
Hydrate.

42:54.114 --> 42:55.240
Damn it.
