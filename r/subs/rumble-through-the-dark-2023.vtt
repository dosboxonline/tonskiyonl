01:56.507 --> 01:57.943
Mama.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.100
<i>I wish I knew
where I came from.</i>

03:00.397 --> 03:02.617
-  Huh?

03:02.617 --> 03:04.314
Hey, Jack.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.710
Come on now.

03:11.495 --> 03:12.931
Yeah.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.630
- Huh?

03:17.545 --> 03:18.937
- Boucher!

03:21.549 --> 03:23.942
Well, there he is.

03:24.987 --> 03:27.381
- Welcome back, Jack.

03:36.738 --> 03:40.002
Looks like
your little naps
are getting longer.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.313
How about a smoke?

03:58.238 --> 04:02.329
Could've had twice this
if you hadn't cracked
my boy's collarbone.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.375
I went down like you said.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.248
Yes, you did.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.426
You earned it.
Come on.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.736
See you tomorrow night!

04:31.227 --> 04:32.750
Hey, there he is.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.884
Oh, fuck. That's Jack Boucher.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.194
Here you go.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.417
He's a good kid.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.462
I just don't really know
what you can expect.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.755
One time, Jack.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.281
One time, asshole.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.199
Get hot.

06:59.723 --> 07:00.985
Let's get hot.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.771
Come now. Red. Red.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.033
Oh, come on. Red.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.211
Come on now. Red.

07:09.211 --> 07:12.214

07:12.214 --> 07:13.258
Yeah?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.348

another one?
- Yeah. Damn straight.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.009
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.186
- Where am I at now?
- Six thousand four hundred.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.318
Sixty-four hundred.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.756
Slide it out there.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.366
-  How much?
- All of it.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.631
- Put it on red.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.084
- Red!

07:56.084 --> 07:57.302
We won.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.525
-  Another bet, sir?

08:06.094 --> 08:09.097
- Sir, are you playing?
- Don't mess with my shit.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.622
I'll be
right here, baby.

08:42.478 --> 08:43.479
Hey.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.048
You got a light?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.065
<i>She just won't stop.</i>

09:13.030 --> 09:14.989
Oh, my God!

09:46.455 --> 09:48.718
-  Listen here,
you son of a bitch.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.024
I got her damn money.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.728
Uh, congratulations, sir.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.077
Count the chips.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.688
Uh, could I, um...
Could I interest you

10:45.688 --> 10:49.431

- Just count the damn chips.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.019
Second. Reverse.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.629
Wait. Hold on.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.414
Oh, you missed the turn...

11:25.423 --> 11:27.034
You going by Luling's?

11:27.034 --> 11:29.340
No, man. Her kids
back from school,

11:29.340 --> 11:30.559
so that ain't gonna happen.

11:31.342 --> 11:34.389
- I hear you.
- What you mean "her kids"?

11:34.389 --> 11:36.391
-  Don't you
mean your kids?

11:59.153 --> 12:01.155
-  Yeah, hopefully.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.179
That pump out there still work?

12:26.615 --> 12:28.617
Damn, boy. You ask me

12:29.618 --> 12:31.707
- How much you want?
- Uh...

12:31.707 --> 12:34.275
- About this much.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.540
Good, 'cause I ain't
got no change.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.935
Long as he's been
coming here, you never have.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.719
- He don't remember that.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.068
Charge him double.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.244
What for?

12:47.244 --> 12:49.464
I lost all that money on him
down there in Itta Bena

12:49.464 --> 12:51.031
- that one night.
-  Oh, here we go.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.120
You gonna tell that damn
Itta Bena story again?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.122
-  I know, right?
- I deserve to tell my story

12:55.122 --> 12:57.428
the way I lost my damn
money on Boucher.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.780
Way down in the damn sticks
where shouldn't no damn body be.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.652
I like the guy carried off
by the mosquitos.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.872
You lost because I won
or because I lost?

13:11.703 --> 13:14.097
Hell, I don't know.
Shouldn't be betting anyhow.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.403
You hear that?

13:15.403 --> 13:17.797
You shouldn't be betting
anyhow.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.669
Heh, this old boy here
giving you advice,

13:20.669 --> 13:22.584
- you know you a damn fool.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.587
No. You the fool...

13:27.241 --> 13:28.677
Come on. Pick up.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.689
- Hmm?
-  <i>Hey. This Ern?</i>

13:40.689 --> 13:43.953
- Tch. Who's this?
- <i>She up?</i>

13:43.953 --> 13:45.912
- Depends.
- <i>On what?</i>

13:47.522 --> 13:49.393
-  Who this is?
- <i>It's Skelly.</i>

13:50.220 --> 13:53.136
- She ain't up.

13:54.268 --> 13:58.446
She might be up
when she find out
what I'm looking at. Hmm.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.839
<i>Jack Boucher.</i>

14:00.970 --> 14:03.886
Really? Jack Boucher?

14:03.886 --> 14:06.236
Hey, I ain't got time for this.
You want him or not?

14:07.585 --> 14:08.717
<i>You sure it's him?</i>

14:09.500 --> 14:11.198
How many times
Big Momma make me fight

14:11.198 --> 14:13.635
on the same card
as the Butcher, huh?

14:15.332 --> 14:16.551
'Course, it's him.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.861
- <i>Bring Jack here.</i>

14:21.861 --> 14:23.601
<i>Not without a damn promise.</i>

14:23.601 --> 14:26.691
- What promise?
- <i>That I don't owe shit.</i>

14:28.650 --> 14:30.173
<i>Ern, you listening?</i>

14:31.740 --> 14:34.961
- <i>She says no.</i>
- You didn't ask her.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.223
<i>I ain't got to, Skelly.</i>

14:36.223 --> 14:38.268
You better think
good and hard again

14:38.268 --> 14:40.401
'cause he gonna leave
any minute now.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.404
I'll get him there,
I don't owe nothing to nobody.

14:44.622 --> 14:48.409
You get him here
and you don't owe
nothing to nobody.

15:11.084 --> 15:11.998
Hey.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.440
What?

15:20.441 --> 15:22.530
Hey, man, do you-- do you mind
hauling me up the road?

15:23.531 --> 15:25.620
I just need a ride
to Clarksdale,

15:25.620 --> 15:26.882
if you're going that way.

15:27.491 --> 15:30.930
My old lady stays
at this trailer park
just right before town.

15:35.064 --> 15:35.978
Nah.

15:37.893 --> 15:41.114
Come on, man. I'm in deep shit.
I... I gotta get home.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.203
That's your problem.

15:45.509 --> 15:46.684
I got some money.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.301
What's your name?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.826
- Your what now?
- Your name, what is it?

16:02.352 --> 16:03.310
Kool.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.094
Cool?

16:06.226 --> 16:07.357
With a K.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.707
Like the damn cigarettes?

16:09.707 --> 16:12.101
My momma loved them,
so...

16:17.672 --> 16:18.847
How much money you got?

16:22.024 --> 16:23.460
Maybe 15.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.770
All right. Give it
to me and get in.

17:00.062 --> 17:03.152
It'd be fine with me
if we just kept on riding.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.330
My old lady don't wanna
see me no way.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.029
You know how they are.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.161
Not really.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.136
If you wanna start walking
across this black night

17:30.136 --> 17:31.920
- with a broke nose...

17:31.920 --> 17:34.009
...then you do that shit again.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.536
Damn, man.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.712
Don't gotta do all that.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.063
You sit still
and fucking ride.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.152
First lights I see
and your ass is out.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.025
- You got it?
- I got it. Shit.

17:57.641 --> 18:01.297
You son of a bitch.
Don't slow down.
You keep pushing.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.083
Me and you,
we going out to the river.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.564
Big Momma gonna be
real excited seeing you again.

18:07.564 --> 18:10.872
Ain't so tough with your nuts
all shriveled up, huh?

18:10.872 --> 18:13.353
Don't nobody do
that shit to me. Goddammit.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.355
Don't nobody do
that shit to me!

18:16.269 --> 18:18.053
Guess what else,

18:18.053 --> 18:20.099
You done sparked my interest
in this here glove box

18:20.099 --> 18:21.839
with all that ridiculousness.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.455
Let's see what you
got going on here.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.718
Holy shit.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.244
This is mine now. Goddammit.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.160
Old ass Jack Boucher.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.944

19:01.836 --> 19:03.881

19:05.579 --> 19:08.059
You motherfucker! You--

19:10.279 --> 19:14.283
Shit! Fuck! God.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.642
<i>Hey, lesbian boy.</i>

19:28.645 --> 19:31.779
<i>Hey, lesbian boy.</i>

19:35.783 --> 19:37.741
Hey, lesbian boy.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.656
<i>Quit calling me that.</i>

19:39.656 --> 19:42.093
<i>That's what your new momma is.</i>

19:42.659 --> 19:44.008
Leave me alone.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.749
You better put your hands
in your pockets.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.100
You shove your hands
in your pockets right now

19:49.100 --> 19:51.190
- or you'll get it worse
than you think.

20:54.862 --> 20:55.819
Wait.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.170
Wait.

21:03.958 --> 21:04.915
Wait.

21:09.442 --> 21:10.356
Wait.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.115
<i>Boss man, come back. Over.</i>

21:32.378 --> 21:33.727
<i>What's on your mind?</i>

21:34.554 --> 21:36.991
<i>Where in the hell
is this fucking town?</i>

21:36.991 --> 21:39.428
We'll be there soon
so shut the fuck up.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.533
Everybody slow up.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.233
Okay. We're gonna
pull over for a minute.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.517
Hey, what's the holdup?

22:36.093 --> 22:37.443
Anybody? Hey.

22:54.634 --> 22:55.635
Anybody here?

22:58.725 --> 23:00.074
If you're hurt, call out.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.384
Baron, what is it?

23:06.863 --> 23:08.735
Don't know yet.

23:21.878 --> 23:22.966
Anything?

23:25.491 --> 23:26.535
Ain't nothing.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.889
- Hello?

23:33.890 --> 23:36.110
-  Anybody out there?

24:06.793 --> 24:08.490
Hey, brother.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.368
Oh, my God.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.513
-  Ugh.
-  Brother.

24:35.778 --> 24:38.607
He must've crawled
out of the truck.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.091
-  He ain't
gonna make it.

24:53.535 --> 24:54.580
Is this what you want?

25:03.023 --> 25:04.111
It'll be quick.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.679
Just look at me brother.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.234
We better call somebody.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.542
You know I can't do that.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.158
Well, we-we could just
go down the road

25:51.158 --> 25:53.116
- and-and call it in.
- You know what, Annette?

25:54.248 --> 25:55.292
Let's just go.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.213
Somebody will be along
soon enough. Come on.

26:26.846 --> 26:27.890
It's heavy.

26:37.465 --> 26:38.988
Hey, baby girl.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.469
What you got there, honey?

26:53.786 --> 26:54.787
Just take it.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.840
About time
you wake your ass up.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.192
Huh? What the hell happened?

27:52.975 --> 27:55.021
You stumbled in here
lookin' crazy as a motherfucker

27:55.021 --> 27:57.937
came by them cornfield,
crawled and rolled all cut up,

27:57.937 --> 27:59.852
moaning about your mama
or some shit.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.376
Set up here at the bar,
took some shots,
and passed the fuck out.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.120
- Was somebody with me?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.643
- I ain't seen nobody.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.690
Did I say where my truck was?

28:12.647 --> 28:14.083
Back down the road somewhere.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.087
Why didn't you call somebody?

28:19.306 --> 28:20.611
We ain't got no phone.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.310
Ain't got no phone?

28:23.310 --> 28:24.920
Ain't never had a need for one.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.792
We don't get many drunk,
beat-up White boys

28:26.792 --> 28:29.098
- looking to make
late-night phone calls.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.492
Closing time, man.
I'mma need that 20 dollars
for them shots.

28:31.492 --> 28:32.493
Yeah.

28:39.587 --> 28:40.936
Here's the 20 I owe you.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.809
Can you take me to my truck?

28:45.724 --> 28:46.725
I got you.

29:00.869 --> 29:04.133
Man, you are fucked up.
You ain't got no business
with no keys in your pocket.

29:30.681 --> 29:31.639
Fuck.

29:34.990 --> 29:35.904
Fuck.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.732
No.

29:47.960 --> 29:48.961
Damn it!

30:18.077 --> 30:19.078
Big Momma.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.316
So what
should we do with it?

32:08.143 --> 32:09.928
- Divide it up?

32:09.928 --> 32:13.496
Ain't no such thing
as a democracy
when it comes to money.

32:13.496 --> 32:17.109
Half this crew are ex-cons,
the other half, cons-in-waiting.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.720
They get one little sniff
of a handout,

32:19.720 --> 32:21.069
they'll think there's more.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.985
And I'll wake up
with my throat cut.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.946
- Burn it then.
- What?

32:27.946 --> 32:30.600
I mean, we got to do
something with it.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.213
We could give it to somebody.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.911
You know, it's not
jackpot lottery money

32:36.911 --> 32:39.740
but it's the type of money that
could change somebody's life.

32:39.740 --> 32:40.828
You can have it.

32:45.528 --> 32:46.921
No. No. I...

32:50.185 --> 32:51.970
- I don't want it.
- How come?

32:53.754 --> 32:54.798
I just...

32:56.583 --> 32:58.498
feel all uneasy about it.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.068
- Just feels like a bad sign.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.332
You and your damn signs.

33:07.507 --> 33:10.466
It brought me
to this rattling heap
you call a carnival.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.556
And now something
brought this money to us.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.168
That how it work?

33:16.168 --> 33:17.952
Only took you a year.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.823
Oh, you've been here
longer than that.

33:24.872 --> 33:27.135
Ha... has it been that long?

33:33.185 --> 33:35.230
And you still think
you'll find your father?

33:36.623 --> 33:39.234
And is he what you hope's
at the end of all this.

33:44.935 --> 33:45.893
Shit.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.551
I shouldn't have said nothin'.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.364
<i>Step right up
to the Princess of Love,</i>

34:22.364 --> 34:24.714
<i>Annette, The Painted Lady.</i>

34:26.325 --> 34:29.328
<i>Pick a symbol
from her colorful sign,</i>

34:29.328 --> 34:31.504
<i>20 bucks buys you a symbol,</i>

34:31.504 --> 34:36.248
<i>find it on her dancing body
and you win 100 dollars.</i>

34:36.248 --> 34:38.032
<i>Now who's feeling lucky?</i>

36:34.931 --> 36:36.194
You wanna try?

36:39.066 --> 36:40.589
All right.
Put your hands like this.

36:42.025 --> 36:45.420
Like that.
There... Like that.

36:47.944 --> 36:51.731
This way. Like that. Okay.

36:51.731 --> 36:52.819
Okay.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.389
You like it?

38:33.354 --> 38:34.355
Mary.

38:43.059 --> 38:44.191
Who are you?

38:51.546 --> 38:52.939
My name is Jack.

39:17.659 --> 39:18.878
Mama, I'm sorry.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.517
What's the matter,
Ricky Joe?

39:50.692 --> 39:53.478
- Tilt-a-Whirl acting up
on you again?

39:56.350 --> 39:57.351
No.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.920
No, I ain't here about
no damn Tilt-a-Whirl.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.756
I think y'all picked up
something at that wreck. Mm?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.063
I seen her with it last night.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.371
I was peeking.

40:18.546 --> 40:19.591
I like to peek...

40:21.070 --> 40:22.115
especially on her.

40:26.467 --> 40:27.512
Ricky Joe,

40:29.209 --> 40:30.950
it's too bad you ain't smarter.

40:32.212 --> 40:33.431
Well, I'm getting there.

40:34.780 --> 40:37.478
You know, I often wonder
how many walls

40:37.478 --> 40:39.306
your mugshot is pinned on.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.744
How many folders
it's tucked into?

40:42.744 --> 40:46.139
Yeah. I wonder how many graves
are full of old men

40:46.139 --> 40:47.401
who didn't know no better.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.755
-  Hm?

40:54.756 --> 40:56.454
All right. Okay.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.326
You got me. You wanna see
what we found?

40:59.979 --> 41:01.328
Mm-hmm.

41:01.328 --> 41:02.938
- I'm gonna show you.
- Mm-hmm.

41:02.938 --> 41:06.202
You ain't gonna like it,
just don't get upset.

41:06.202 --> 41:07.943
Oh, look I got a fucking gun.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.296
What is the old saying
about bringing a wrench

41:13.296 --> 41:14.428
to a gun fight?

41:15.603 --> 41:18.954
That's what we call
a social faux pas, Ricky Joe.

41:19.825 --> 41:23.219
Go on, Ricky Joe,
get out of my fucking office.

41:23.219 --> 41:24.830
-  Right. I hear you.
-  That's it.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.484
- Walk out. Walk out.
- A-all right.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.312
All red-faced and sweaty.

41:29.312 --> 41:30.662
All right. Baron.

41:32.664 --> 41:35.580
You ain't the worst
I've seen, Ricky Joe.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.499
You don't know shit.

43:19.161 --> 43:20.554
Need something, Big Momma?

43:23.209 --> 43:24.166
No.

43:25.298 --> 43:27.126
It doesn't look like
it's gonna stop raining.

43:27.126 --> 43:30.303
It ain't. I can tell it
in my knee bone.

43:31.521 --> 43:33.045
I wish I had a dollar
for everything

43:33.045 --> 43:34.916
your knee bone claimed to know.

43:37.397 --> 43:39.312
What you think happened
to Skelly?

43:39.312 --> 43:41.140
Ain't no telling.

43:41.140 --> 43:42.402
You think he lying?

43:42.402 --> 43:43.882
I think Skelly would tell you

43:43.882 --> 43:45.710
he was having dinner
with Jesus Christ

43:45.710 --> 43:48.190
if he thought he could
buy himself a little more time.

43:48.190 --> 43:50.584
Me and you both know
Skelly can't handle Jack.

43:50.584 --> 43:52.630
He's the one we got
to look out for.

43:53.587 --> 43:56.372
- Word's out.
- Word been out.

43:56.372 --> 43:58.940
Apparently he ain't
so easy to hold onto.

44:00.159 --> 44:02.901
You know, your knee bone says
it's gonna keep on raining,

44:03.728 --> 44:04.903
that ain't stopping nothing.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.079
Shacks look full up.

44:08.515 --> 44:10.996
God has yet to create
any kind of weather

44:10.996 --> 44:13.476
that would detour
his flock from sin.

44:14.695 --> 44:16.218
Hallelujah, Big Momma.

44:17.350 --> 44:18.394
Hallelujah.

44:24.139 --> 44:25.358
Here comes one more.

44:34.497 --> 44:37.022
- Holy shit, Big Momma.
- What's that?

44:38.893 --> 44:41.330
Who was it that Jesus
raised up from the grave?

44:42.854 --> 44:43.942
Lazarus?

44:45.117 --> 44:47.859
Yeah. Lazarus.

45:16.757 --> 45:18.063
Here's your boyfriend.

45:18.063 --> 45:20.326
That don't look like my money.

45:20.326 --> 45:22.197
I don't have
your damn money no more.

45:23.198 --> 45:24.243
I had it

45:24.983 --> 45:26.941
before this piece of shit
got in the way.

45:30.031 --> 45:32.207
Look at that. Huh?

45:34.079 --> 45:36.385
- I know who he came from.
-  Hey, motherfucker.

45:37.647 --> 45:38.866
Remember where you are.

45:38.866 --> 45:40.172
Turn him loose.

45:41.042 --> 45:43.741
- Jack never had
no manners anyway.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.395
Y'all both back off.
Right now.

45:51.009 --> 45:53.663
What you figure
this little show does for you?

45:54.577 --> 45:57.667
I'm showing you because
you ain't doing that shit to me.

45:58.886 --> 46:02.542
I can't figure whether
you're getting braver or dumber.

46:03.543 --> 46:06.851
I had your money,
Big Momma. Every nickel.

46:08.243 --> 46:09.418
So, where is it?

46:10.332 --> 46:11.464
I lost it

46:12.421 --> 46:13.945
because of this
little shit-eater.

46:15.468 --> 46:17.775
Look at my damn eyes.
You know I'm telling the truth.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.212
You look like a pile
of shit bricks.

46:20.212 --> 46:22.214
And you don't look
capable no more.

46:22.214 --> 46:24.956
- Capable of what?
- Not a single damn thing.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.923
Most I ever let anyone
get into me

46:35.923 --> 46:38.056
when I knew they didn't have
a pot to piss in

46:38.056 --> 46:39.709
was about ten grand.

46:39.709 --> 46:41.755
- Know where he at?

46:41.755 --> 46:43.148
I could probably figure it out.

46:43.148 --> 46:45.280
The only reason
I let you get in so deep

46:45.280 --> 46:47.065
was because you made me
some money

46:47.065 --> 46:49.110
back when you was worth a shit.

46:49.676 --> 46:53.332
I ain't never seen nobody
fix a fight as good as you.

46:53.332 --> 46:55.813
Even when everybody know
it was a setup,

46:55.813 --> 46:58.554
it always come off different
from what they was expecting.

46:58.554 --> 46:59.817
Yeah.

47:00.687 --> 47:02.297
That was a good trick.

47:03.298 --> 47:06.214
But I don't figure
you got any more tricks left,

47:06.214 --> 47:07.781
else you wouldn't
have let that worm

47:07.781 --> 47:09.000
on my floor get to you.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.002
I made you money
before I started fixing.

47:11.002 --> 47:12.220
I remember that.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.919
Yeah. I remember them days too.

47:14.919 --> 47:17.225
You used to be hell.

47:17.225 --> 47:18.400
Ain't no doubt.

47:19.619 --> 47:21.882
But hell has caught up.

47:25.625 --> 47:29.498
See, Jack, I even know
why you tryin' to score big.

47:30.499 --> 47:32.066
I know about that woman

47:32.066 --> 47:34.547
you letting die
in that place over there.

47:34.547 --> 47:36.679
I know you pissed away
her land...

47:36.679 --> 47:38.333
- Her house.

47:38.333 --> 47:42.555
Mr. Bank Man comes out here
now and again to get rubbed on.

47:42.555 --> 47:44.426
He told me all about it.

47:45.601 --> 47:48.517
Says he warned her not to sign
nothing over to you.

47:48.517 --> 47:51.259
- Mm-hmm.
- Says he saw it all coming.

47:51.259 --> 47:54.480
Says she told him
to mind his own business
or some shit.

47:54.480 --> 47:58.179
- Good for him.
- Yeah. Good for him.

47:59.180 --> 48:01.313
Make him feel smart, I reckon.

48:01.922 --> 48:04.185
But you in a big hole.

48:04.185 --> 48:05.795
A big hole that got bigger

48:05.795 --> 48:08.494
when you started dancing
around Big Momma Sweet.

48:12.454 --> 48:14.065
What kind of price
you got on me?

48:16.110 --> 48:19.026
The kind that'll
get you chased down
no matter where you go.

48:22.421 --> 48:26.425
Oh.

48:27.643 --> 48:29.297
- Mm, mm, mm.

48:36.348 --> 48:37.479
What you doing, boy?

48:38.480 --> 48:41.831
- Come on. Open up. Open up.

48:53.191 --> 48:55.889
I keep waitin' for something
different from you...

48:56.934 --> 48:58.413
...but you more fucked up

48:58.413 --> 49:00.024
every time I see you.

49:01.503 --> 49:03.941
And you ain't got
no damn money...

49:03.941 --> 49:05.246
- ...'cause if you did,

49:05.246 --> 49:07.205
you'd be giving it to me.

49:07.205 --> 49:10.382
- I believe you maybe had it.

49:10.382 --> 49:13.298
I heard you was running hot
down in Natchez.

49:13.298 --> 49:17.563
But had ain't
the same thing as have.

49:20.653 --> 49:22.829
- Don't really need no fire...

49:23.786 --> 49:25.440
...long since figured that out.

49:31.098 --> 49:32.752
I can get you paid, Big Momma.

49:32.752 --> 49:34.797
- Untrue.
- I can.

49:34.797 --> 49:36.930
I got some more stuff
I can sell.

49:36.930 --> 49:38.410
Valuable stuff.

49:38.410 --> 49:40.673
- Listen to you.
- I swear to God.

49:40.673 --> 49:42.762
God ain't cooperating
with you no more.

49:42.762 --> 49:45.634
Just give me a day or two.
I won't run off.

49:45.634 --> 49:47.506
No, you won't.

49:47.506 --> 49:50.378
- But you can't get me my money.

49:51.162 --> 49:52.250
Me and you both know

49:52.250 --> 49:54.252
the only way for you
to get me paid

49:54.252 --> 49:56.210
is the old-fashioned way.

49:57.646 --> 49:59.822
- I can't do that.
- How come?

49:59.822 --> 50:03.348
Hell, you seen me.
My damn head will explode.

50:03.348 --> 50:05.654
You've been fighting, I heard.

50:05.654 --> 50:07.961
Those weren't real fights
and you know it.

50:07.961 --> 50:09.397
Not like you want.

50:09.397 --> 50:10.964
And I was full of dope.

50:10.964 --> 50:12.879
You can get
full of dope again.

50:12.879 --> 50:15.142
- I think you know

50:15.142 --> 50:17.101
this is the right choice,

50:17.101 --> 50:18.276
but you decide.

50:18.841 --> 50:21.496
Fight or don't fight.

50:21.496 --> 50:23.890
You might get hurt if you do.

50:24.499 --> 50:27.589
You will get hurt
if you don't.

50:36.468 --> 50:37.556
I ain't fighting.

50:42.822 --> 50:46.086
Big Momma, Big Momma,
you know me.

50:46.086 --> 50:47.261
Hold it right there.

50:57.141 --> 51:00.318
-  Hold his head.

51:01.275 --> 51:03.060
Stop. Will you?

51:04.626 --> 51:07.760
I'll do it, Big Momma.
Whatever you want.

51:13.635 --> 51:16.986
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

51:16.986 --> 51:22.209
I wish you knew how bad
I wanna put you out your misery.

51:24.298 --> 51:26.996
I wish you were the Jack
I used to know.

51:27.823 --> 51:29.347
- But for one night,

51:29.347 --> 51:30.609
- you will be.

51:33.002 --> 51:35.918
I don't give a shit
if your head explode

51:35.918 --> 51:38.138
or if you catch fire.

51:38.834 --> 51:40.836
You ain't no good to me dead.

51:40.836 --> 51:42.708
You ain't much good alive.

51:42.708 --> 51:45.232
But you're gonna
give me a fight.

51:46.886 --> 51:48.975
This little burn ain't nothing.

51:48.975 --> 51:52.196
That little headache you got,
ain't nothing.

51:52.761 --> 51:54.981
Screw me again

51:54.981 --> 51:57.418
and you will know what hurt is.

51:57.418 --> 52:00.291
And I will feed
this sweet land of ours

52:00.291 --> 52:02.815
with your sorry skin and bones.

52:04.338 --> 52:08.168
Now take this with you
so you won't forget.

52:16.263 --> 52:17.569
<i>Jack.</i>

52:36.022 --> 52:37.241
It's okay, Jack.

52:38.242 --> 52:39.591
You can open up now.

52:48.121 --> 52:49.209
Listen to me.

52:51.690 --> 52:54.127
Tomorrow, Jack,
whatever you have to do

52:54.127 --> 52:56.260
to get him to leave you
alone, you do it.

52:57.870 --> 52:59.350
I can't.

52:59.350 --> 53:00.655
You're gonna have to

53:02.222 --> 53:04.572
because that little jackass
isn't going away.

53:05.747 --> 53:08.054
And he's gonna be
wherever you go

53:08.054 --> 53:11.492
because the world never runs out
of assholes like him.

53:13.494 --> 53:15.453
People who know
they have the odds.

53:18.499 --> 53:21.110
It doesn't matter
what he says about me.

53:22.068 --> 53:25.376
It doesn't matter
what he uses to pick a fight.

53:25.376 --> 53:27.682
Nobody has the right
to call you names

53:27.682 --> 53:29.206
or to hurt you.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.250
Nobody.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.124
What is it?

53:38.127 --> 53:39.694
I'm afraid if I do
anything bad...

53:41.783 --> 53:43.437
...they're gonna take me
away from you.

53:45.918 --> 53:47.180
Or you'll tell them

53:47.180 --> 53:48.703
you can't do it no more.

53:49.878 --> 53:51.532
That's what they always say.

53:52.403 --> 53:54.231
And I don't want it
to happen this time.

53:55.928 --> 53:57.451
I don't wanna leave you

53:58.931 --> 54:01.716
so I can't do nothing bad
or they'll take me away.

54:01.716 --> 54:02.717
Oh.

54:04.806 --> 54:05.764
Oh.

54:06.591 --> 54:08.593
I swear no such thing
will happen.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.508
I swear it.

54:12.684 --> 54:15.034
I will always be
on your side.

54:24.304 --> 54:25.479
What's today, Ern?

54:28.221 --> 54:30.136
-  Thursday, Big Momma.
- Mm-hmm.

54:30.919 --> 54:32.399
Sounds to me like Friday night

54:32.399 --> 54:34.662
would be a good night
for Jack's big comeback.

54:35.663 --> 54:38.187
We got shacks
full of fools tonight,

54:38.187 --> 54:39.711
we gonna spread the word.

54:40.538 --> 54:42.279
I figure this is
the kind of news

54:42.279 --> 54:43.932
that'll burn in quick.

54:43.932 --> 54:46.021
- What you think, Jack?

54:58.251 --> 54:59.383
Get up, Jack.

55:01.689 --> 55:02.734
Come on.

55:03.822 --> 55:05.737
Get that trash
that you brought in here

55:05.737 --> 55:06.912
out of my house.

55:08.217 --> 55:09.915
Go put it out there
in the dirt somewhere.

55:22.580 --> 55:25.060
Deep, Jack. Bury it deep.

55:26.366 --> 55:28.542
Where them damn dogs
can't dig it up.

57:12.254 --> 57:14.692
Get it off me.
Take this shit off me.

57:15.519 --> 57:16.563
Get it off me.

57:17.651 --> 57:20.567
Get it off me, get it off,
get it off me.

57:32.144 --> 57:35.103
Come on, you motherfucker.
Come on.

57:38.411 --> 57:39.456
Come on.

57:50.597 --> 57:53.208
You're a weak piece
of motherfucking shit,
you know that?

57:53.774 --> 57:55.254
She owns your ass now.

57:56.603 --> 57:58.126
She owns your ass now.

57:59.301 --> 58:01.608
Come on. You want me?

58:01.608 --> 58:03.610
Come on, take me,
motherfucker. Come on!

58:03.610 --> 58:06.483
I'll fucking beat
the fucking shit out of you,
you motherfucker!

58:06.483 --> 58:09.616
They own you, motherfucker.
Look at it. Look at it.

58:09.616 --> 58:12.532
Look at it! Look at it!
They own you, you piece of shit.

58:12.532 --> 58:17.058
They own your fucking ass.

58:39.603 --> 58:41.169
<i>Come on, motherfucker, come on!</i>

58:41.866 --> 58:44.346
Fuck you, you piece of shit!
I'll fuck you up.

58:45.086 --> 58:47.045
<i>I'm gonna kill you,
you fucking piece of shit.</i>

58:47.045 --> 58:49.526
How'd that feel?

58:50.831 --> 58:53.530
- How did that feel?

59:01.015 --> 59:02.277
How's that feel?

59:10.111 --> 59:13.114
How's that feel?
How's that feel?

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.138
-  Shit!

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:22.401
Hey!

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:28.423
What?

01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:34.038
How come your hands
don't never get dirty?

01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:37.258
My hands do get dirty,

01:01:37.258 --> 01:01:40.174
just not the same way
as yours do, Ricky Joe.

01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:45.092
That ain't true, baby girl.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.882
Ricky Joe acts like
he knows something.

01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:56.625
How come you say that?

01:01:58.018 --> 01:02:01.587
The way he was just
looking at me right now
and talking to me...

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.895
Shit was weird.

01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:07.114
Ricky Joe knows
how to fix

01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:08.289
any engine there is.

01:02:08.986 --> 01:02:10.770
Generally speaking,
he dumb as shit.

01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:13.860
That's the part that worries me.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.644
Dumb don't think it through.

01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:16.950
Dumb just does.

01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:30.616
You look spooked.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:36.274
Probably just the storm
had me up all night

01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:38.885
thinking about
all kinds of shit.

01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:42.715
Like what?

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:52.246
I need to go for a ride.

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:55.249
Where to?

01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:00.298
It don't really matter.
I just...

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.519
need to let the windows
down, you know?

01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:11.265
- Tell you what.

01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:12.440
Take my ride.

01:03:13.137 --> 01:03:15.966
Go on, I won't need it
for a while.

01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:40.224
I see you, girl.

01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:43.270
Mm, mm, mm.

01:05:03.508 --> 01:05:07.120
- Come on. Come on.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.992
You got a little secret,
don't you, baby girl, huh?

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:11.081
- You got a little secret?

01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:13.213
I'm gonna fucking
outstretch you,
you're gonna get it bad, girl.

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.913
-  Fucking bitch!
-  What the fuck's

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.740
wrong with you?
You stupid piece of shit!

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.481
- All right. Easy now.

01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:22.005
- Here, you wanna beat on me?

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.703
You wanna beat on me?
You wanna beat on me like that?

01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:25.747
- Where is it?

01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.358
I want that money.
Where is it?

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:28.533
I don't got shit.

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:30.100
The fuck you hiding
under there?

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.189
Uh-huh. I knew it.

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:40.762
- Oh, you wanna play too? Huh?

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:43.678
All right. All right.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.594
Come on. Come on, motherfucker.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.335
Huh, look at that.

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.337
That's cute.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.617
Piece of shit!

01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:12.403
Fuck. Fucking guy.

01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:13.491
Are you all right?

01:06:14.318 --> 01:06:16.973
"Are you all right" looks like
more of a question for you.

01:06:18.235 --> 01:06:19.323
Hold on, hold on.

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:22.891
Do I...

01:06:24.197 --> 01:06:25.285
do I know you?

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:29.681
I don't know you.

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:36.340
But thanks for...
you know.

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:43.303
- Son of a gun.
- Hm.

01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.653
I'll be damned. The Butcher

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.004
standing right here
in front of me
after all these years.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.527
- Yeah.
- I can't believe

01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:51.529
I didn't figure you out
when you came in the store.

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:52.878
- I've just been
standing there...
- I-I don't--

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:54.271
...thinking about it
like an idiot.

01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:55.881
I'm sorry, I...

01:06:55.881 --> 01:06:58.840
I don't seem to recall.
My head...

01:07:00.233 --> 01:07:02.061
I-I'm Gunner Clark's sister.

01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:04.846
- Ginny.
- Gunner Clark?

01:07:04.846 --> 01:07:07.501
You and him used to fight
the same nights up in Memphis.

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:08.763
Oh, yeah.

01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.591
Oh, God. We were all
a lot younger then.

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.637
- Yeah.
- Prettier too.

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:14.378
Hey, you, you're pretty.

01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:17.511
- You still fighting?
- Yeah.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.645
Do I look like
I could win a fight?

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:23.126
Well, what you looked like
never seemed to matter much.

01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:25.911
Only God above
has you figured out.

01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:27.956
And I bet you even
keep Him guessing.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.221
Son of a gun.

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:33.745
Well, you be good, Jack.

01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:36.008
- All right. You too.
- Woo, it's hot.

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.265
<i>So that man out there,
he's a fighter?</i>

01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:17.745
Like boxing or...

01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:19.530
Boxing and shit.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.402
He's a fighter
of the first kind.

01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:25.666
Nothing but air
between fist and face.

01:08:33.239 --> 01:08:35.241
Holy shit.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.528
<i>Jack?</i>

01:11:14.574 --> 01:11:16.010
Jack?

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:12.458
It's you and me, Jack.

01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:33.697
Hey.

01:12:46.927 --> 01:12:48.494
Look, I-I just wanted to...

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.106
thank you for, you know,
helping me out and--

01:12:52.106 --> 01:12:53.499
What'd you do, follow me?

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.764
Yeah, but I got reasons.

01:12:57.764 --> 01:12:59.070
Don't everybody.

01:12:59.723 --> 01:13:01.507
Hey, I got questions.

01:13:06.294 --> 01:13:07.339
You a cop?

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.168
Do I look like one?

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:12.126
Not one I ever seen.

01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:16.348
The lady at the store
said you were a fighter,
is that right?

01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:19.220
Once upon a time.

01:13:20.308 --> 01:13:21.832
- Hold on a second.

01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:24.356
If you ain't a cop, I gotta go.
My daylight is running out.

01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:26.532
Will you just look at me
and listen to me

01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:28.621
- for half a damn second?

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.847
Dammit. Fucking truck.

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.242
Son of a bitch.

01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:46.987
Looks like you need a ride.

01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:49.033
Yeah. Looks like I need a ride.

01:13:59.173 --> 01:14:00.827
Alrighty.

01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:06.006
- Do me a favor.
- What's all that?

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:08.661
Take that.

01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:10.620
Bring it inside.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.116
Hey, Maryann.

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:33.469
Hey.

01:14:36.297 --> 01:14:38.952
-  Hey. Hi, Maryann.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.825
Jack.

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:49.310
What happened to you, Jack?

01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:56.404
Were the kids being rough
with you again?

01:14:57.971 --> 01:14:59.277
No, Maryann.

01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:02.498
No, I'm fine.

01:15:04.412 --> 01:15:05.457
I'm okay.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:13.378
Can you put it
on the bed there?

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:48.718
You need to hear
something, Maryann.

01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:53.636
And you might not understand.

01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:57.857
You might not even know
who's saying it.

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:01.295
And that's okay.

01:16:04.037 --> 01:16:05.082
It's gone.

01:16:06.474 --> 01:16:08.215
Your family's land.

01:16:10.522 --> 01:16:11.567
All of it.

01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:19.400
The house is next...

01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:24.318
in only a few more days.

01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:29.323
I know I told you
I'd get you home, but...

01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:33.066
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to do that now.

01:16:34.894 --> 01:16:37.593
All I can do now is tell you...

01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:39.725
I'm sorry.

01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:45.557
But even saying it,
it sounds like bullshit.

01:16:57.308 --> 01:16:59.092
<i>You made me your son.</i>

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.141
<i>You gave it all to me.</i>

01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:11.017
<i>And I can't give
any of it back.</i>

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.072
You deserve to be home.

01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:26.772
<i>In the home
that you gave to me.</i>

01:17:33.213 --> 01:17:34.954
<i>I wanna tell you
I'm coming back.</i>

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:40.133
<i>I wanna sit with you,</i>

01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:43.484
<i>tell you all the things
I never could before.</i>

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:48.838
But I gotta go fight, Maryann.

01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:54.887
I'm gonna take the jewelry.

01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:58.978
That's all that's left
and I'm gonna beg like a dog.

01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:04.680
But I don't think it'll matter.

01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:08.858
It's gonna be a bad one.

01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:13.950
They're all bad.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.085
But nothing like this
is gonna be.

01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:29.879
I don't know if I'll make it.

01:18:34.187 --> 01:18:36.624
I don't know
if I'm gonna see you again.

01:19:43.474 --> 01:19:45.563
You ever know a woman
named Sally Magill?

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:48.827
Know her from what?

01:19:49.523 --> 01:19:51.264
From 25 years ago?

01:19:53.353 --> 01:19:55.529
Look in there if you want
but it doesn't go back that far.

01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:57.705
I did look.

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:00.360
You see her name?

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.406
There's nothing in here
that I can understand.

01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:03.407
Look,

01:20:04.408 --> 01:20:07.498
if this is what you're after,
I can't do it right now.

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:13.069
I can't help it.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.637
I saw you at that gas station
and that woman said

01:20:16.637 --> 01:20:19.205
that you were a fighter
and that your name
means "butcher."

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:22.295
Those are the only two things
Sally ever told me
about my father.

01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:25.472
He was a fighter
and that his name
meant something.

01:20:25.472 --> 01:20:27.474
Yeah, everybody's name
means something.

01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:31.870
Is all that true?
That stuff you told her?

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:34.786
Yeah.

01:20:35.482 --> 01:20:37.136
Why do you have
to fight tonight?

01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:40.052
Long story.

01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:43.099
Well, it seemed
pretty damn short in there.

01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:45.492
Then what the hell
are you asking for
if you heard it already?

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.800
I had the money
and then it was gone.

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:51.759
Look,

01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:54.501
I can't tell you
what you wanna hear.

01:20:56.329 --> 01:20:57.287
Besides,

01:20:58.157 --> 01:20:59.767
I wouldn't remember you anyway.

01:21:23.095 --> 01:21:25.097
- What happened to it?
- What?

01:21:26.577 --> 01:21:28.405
- The money,
what happened to it?

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:29.493
It don't matter.

01:21:33.584 --> 01:21:36.195
God knows I've imagined
what you might be like

01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:37.501
or look like.

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:42.506
God knows you are way
beyond any of that.

01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:45.378
You haven't imagined me
because you don't know who I am.

01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.818
Here's what you need
to learn, Jack.

01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:55.911
There is this great big world
out there spinning.

01:21:56.563 --> 01:21:58.826
And sometimes,
it spins with you.

01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:00.524
Sometimes, it spins
against you.

01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:02.178
But sometimes,

01:22:02.178 --> 01:22:04.702
it spins you right into
what you need.

01:22:06.138 --> 01:22:08.662
I heard what that woman said
about you being a fighter.

01:22:08.662 --> 01:22:12.362
So, I followed you to your house
because you're the only man,

01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:14.103
the only one I ever come across

01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:16.932
who I thought had a prayer
of being my father.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.846
- It's a long shot. I know.

01:22:18.846 --> 01:22:20.109
Most things are.

01:22:25.114 --> 01:22:27.594
I was a fighter.
I ain't anymore.

01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:31.294
Your story about the world
spinning around

01:22:31.294 --> 01:22:32.512
can't change any of that.

01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:41.869
Whether you believe it or not,

01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:44.263
I was sent here to help you.

01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:50.617
I don't know, okay?
I don't know
if I'm your daughter,

01:22:50.617 --> 01:22:54.404
but I sure as hell know
that I'm your angel.

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.276
I bet you never thought
an angel's doing

01:22:57.276 --> 01:22:58.538
such dirty work.

01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:01.672
I ain't no angel from heaven.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.283
But it don't really matter
where I'm from.

01:23:04.283 --> 01:23:05.371
It just matters...

01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:07.634
that I'm here.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.779
Where did you get that?

01:23:24.782 --> 01:23:26.958
This is another one
of those long stories.

01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:51.287
You are my angel.

01:25:12.194 --> 01:25:13.978
Better light one up
for me too.

01:25:17.286 --> 01:25:18.330
Oh, yeah.

01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:46.793
Are you sure
this is right?

01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:51.189
Yeah, it's the place.

01:26:24.962 --> 01:26:28.400
It's the Butcher! Jack Boucher!

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.837
- Keep on going.

01:27:03.653 --> 01:27:05.481
-  Let's go!

01:27:06.612 --> 01:27:09.093
Let's go, right here.
That's Jack Boucher.

01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:16.796
- I'll be right back.

01:27:16.796 --> 01:27:18.233
I'm going with you.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.538
You don't wanna go in there.

01:27:19.538 --> 01:27:21.627
I sure as hell don't
wanna be out here.

01:27:22.672 --> 01:27:24.108
Just keep the doors locked.

01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:29.331
And might as well keep
the engine running too.

01:27:38.905 --> 01:27:40.037
Hey, dog.

01:27:44.476 --> 01:27:45.695
Right on time.

01:27:51.309 --> 01:27:52.702
Who's the pretty boy?

01:28:00.318 --> 01:28:02.233
- What's that supposed to be?
-  It's what I owe you.

01:28:02.233 --> 01:28:03.495
Twelve large.

01:28:03.495 --> 01:28:06.063
-  You little bitch.
- Fuck you.

01:28:06.063 --> 01:28:07.804
- Hey, fuck you.
- Hey, how many times

01:28:07.804 --> 01:28:09.371
I gotta tell you to shut up?

01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:10.937
This don't concern you.

01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:14.898
I came here to fight.
That was my deal.

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:16.900
I know you ain't
back-talking Big Momma.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.728
You gonna get
to fight something.

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:34.613
Couldn't find nobody bigger?

01:28:34.613 --> 01:28:36.920
The bigger they are, Jack.
Ain't that how it go?

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.531
That's how it goes.
But it don't matter.
You got your money.

01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:41.664
Did it have a resurrection?

01:28:41.664 --> 01:28:43.535
Yeah, something like that.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:45.755
Come on, count it.

01:28:45.755 --> 01:28:48.323
- I don't need to.
- Good. I'm gone.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.498
Gone where?

01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:51.500
Away from here.

01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:06.776
That ain't how it works,
Big Momma. Even is even.

01:29:06.776 --> 01:29:08.430
We ain't gonna mess with you.

01:29:09.213 --> 01:29:10.345
You paid up.

01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:15.045
But you should at least
have a good look outside

01:29:15.045 --> 01:29:16.742
before you hightail it.

01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:22.139
Must be 500-strong.

01:29:24.315 --> 01:29:25.534
I don't care.

01:29:27.057 --> 01:29:28.885
You could make
some real money.

01:29:28.885 --> 01:29:29.973
I'm done.

01:29:32.541 --> 01:29:34.194
That ain't the Jack I know.

01:29:35.674 --> 01:29:39.069
The Jack I know,
eyes light up
at such a spectacle.

01:29:40.897 --> 01:29:42.159
The Jack I know

01:29:43.073 --> 01:29:45.945
make a bunch of fools
out of a whole bunch of people.

01:29:47.599 --> 01:29:48.644
The Jack I know

01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:51.516
rumbles through the dark

01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:54.824
like a man chasing something
he ain't never gonna catch,

01:29:54.824 --> 01:29:57.740
but he chases all the same.

01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:01.831
Knowing that there is something
out there somewhere,

01:30:02.658 --> 01:30:04.660
barely out of reach,

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.707
you can feel it on the skin
of your fingertips.

01:30:08.707 --> 01:30:10.970
It's so, so close.

01:30:12.145 --> 01:30:13.538
The Jack I know,

01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:18.848
always thinking,
"this could be the one."

01:30:21.894 --> 01:30:23.418
I've been rehabilitated.

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.681
Ain't no such thing.

01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:27.596
Or I'd be out of business.

01:30:28.945 --> 01:30:32.775
You out of one hole, Jack,
but not the other.

01:30:35.386 --> 01:30:37.606
I know what you still need.

01:30:40.217 --> 01:30:41.871
I hear that big house

01:30:41.871 --> 01:30:43.394
- goes up for auction...
- Hey.

01:30:43.394 --> 01:30:44.830
...first of next week,

01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:47.398
and that woman's still lying
in that other place.

01:30:47.398 --> 01:30:49.531
- I know where she's at.
- Mm, mm, mm.

01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:53.056
I also know you won't pay me
30 grand to fight
that big son of a bitch.

01:30:53.056 --> 01:30:55.362
You right. I won't.

01:30:57.016 --> 01:30:59.845
But you're a seven to one
underdog, sweetheart.

01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:21.040
So is that it?

01:31:22.346 --> 01:31:23.390
Hold on.

01:31:24.827 --> 01:31:26.785
Would you mind telling me
what the hell you're doing?

01:31:28.439 --> 01:31:29.527
Figuring the odds.

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.399
- Of what?
- The fight.

01:31:33.879 --> 01:31:35.620
But you gave her
the money, right?

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.926
She got it.

01:31:37.579 --> 01:31:40.016
Well, good. Then let's get
the hell out of here.

01:31:40.016 --> 01:31:43.672
- Wait.

01:31:46.588 --> 01:31:50.069
Oh, shit. Jack, is that
who you're supposed
to be fighting tonight?

01:31:50.069 --> 01:31:53.029
Why the fuck you all standing
around not doing shit?

01:31:53.638 --> 01:31:54.552
Yeah.

01:31:58.164 --> 01:31:59.514
He will kill you, Jack.

01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:02.473
I can keep the house.

01:32:02.473 --> 01:32:04.127
You could get a lot worse.

01:32:05.781 --> 01:32:09.872
Jack, please, let's just
go back to Maryann's.

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:13.745
You don't gotta do this.

01:32:13.745 --> 01:32:14.964
No.

01:32:16.313 --> 01:32:17.749
There is no in-between.

01:32:19.446 --> 01:32:22.798
Jack, if you get out
this damn car,

01:32:22.798 --> 01:32:25.409
I swear that I will
hurt you myself.

01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:33.243
You're an angel.

01:32:36.376 --> 01:32:37.682
It's gonna be all right.

01:32:39.728 --> 01:32:41.860
Jack. Jack!

01:32:49.955 --> 01:32:51.043
Seven to one?

01:32:51.043 --> 01:32:52.523
Seven to one.

01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:54.264
You gonna let me pick this up?

01:32:54.264 --> 01:32:56.658
I don't know.
What you think, Ern?

01:32:56.658 --> 01:32:59.965
I think that's the craziest
fucking White boy I ever seen.

01:33:00.705 --> 01:33:02.838
I reckon that means
you can pick it up.

01:33:03.447 --> 01:33:06.319
But when that clock strikes
midnight, Cinderella,

01:33:06.319 --> 01:33:08.321
there won't be no more magic.

01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:11.629
If you lose, you still owe me.

01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:13.370
And if I don't get my money,

01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:15.415
you'll be laying
with Skelly in that hole

01:33:15.415 --> 01:33:17.200
you already dug once.

01:33:22.814 --> 01:33:24.033
I wanna make a bet.

01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:35.740
I'm gonna miss you, Jack.

01:33:49.319 --> 01:33:50.407
What I say?

01:33:57.719 --> 01:33:59.372
What the hell is going on?

01:33:59.372 --> 01:34:00.765
I can't leave her there.

01:34:01.505 --> 01:34:03.507
I don't expect you
or nobody else to understand.

01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:06.815
Jesus Christ. You can't fight.

01:34:06.815 --> 01:34:07.990
It's done.

01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:10.166
What do you mean "it's done"?

01:34:10.732 --> 01:34:13.909
- That guy will kill you.
- I said it's done.

01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:15.650
- No.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.608
No, come on, Jack.

01:34:18.174 --> 01:34:20.045
I just found you.

01:34:20.045 --> 01:34:22.004
You don't have to do this.

01:34:22.004 --> 01:34:23.701
Yeah, I do.

01:34:24.789 --> 01:34:28.053
No, I'm supposed to be
shoving you out of your grave,

01:34:28.053 --> 01:34:30.142
not dragging you back
down into it.

01:34:30.142 --> 01:34:32.884
- Jack.

01:34:32.884 --> 01:34:34.146
Look, I need you to go.

01:34:35.104 --> 01:34:36.279
You don't get to tell me that.

01:34:36.279 --> 01:34:37.584
This ain't no place for you.

01:34:37.584 --> 01:34:39.761
Look around, this ain't
no place for nobody.

01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:42.546
You're batshit,
but I'm not leaving you.

01:34:51.903 --> 01:34:53.383
It's time!

01:34:56.865 --> 01:34:58.127
They say you could fight.

01:35:00.303 --> 01:35:01.913
I hope like hell it's true.

01:35:02.784 --> 01:35:06.265
Yeah!

01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:17.189
We got ourselves
a fight tonight!

01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:18.277
Yeah!

01:35:18.277 --> 01:35:20.715
Are you ready?

01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:25.154
Make some noise
for your hostess,
Big Momma Sweet!

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:28.766
- Whoo.

01:35:34.032 --> 01:35:35.338
All right now.

01:35:38.863 --> 01:35:41.997
Whoo, look at all these fools.

01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:46.088
- Yeah!

01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:02.931
You got this, Jack.
Rip his face off!

01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:14.029
-  Come here.
- Hey, don't touch her.

01:36:16.292 --> 01:36:18.685
- Damn you.
-  All you fuckers,
listen up.

01:36:18.685 --> 01:36:20.775
Brawling for your
pleasure tonight

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:23.212
on this fine piece
of Delta dirt,

01:36:23.212 --> 01:36:25.257
busting from out
the fire-crusted...

01:36:25.257 --> 01:36:26.519
- ...hellscape of...

01:36:26.519 --> 01:36:28.826
- Annette?

01:36:28.826 --> 01:36:32.090
- We got in this corner, Ax.
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:35.224
He looks like
a big old stack of pissed-off
pork chop fucker,

01:36:35.224 --> 01:36:38.053
drag you down to hell
and spit you back up.

01:36:38.053 --> 01:36:42.535
Squaring off against
this gargantuan slab
of overcooked meat...

01:36:43.972 --> 01:36:47.366
coming hot out of the chute,
he's everybody's favorite,

01:36:47.366 --> 01:36:49.499
Jack "The Butcher" Boucher!

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.899
Now you know
Big Momma's rules.

01:36:57.899 --> 01:37:02.381
No weapons, no tricks,
just skin to skin.

01:37:04.253 --> 01:37:06.864
We gonna get things
started up in a hot minute,

01:37:06.864 --> 01:37:08.605
- but in the meantime...
-  Jack!

01:37:08.605 --> 01:37:10.346
...y'all place your bets.

01:37:10.346 --> 01:37:12.130
Seven to one.
Lay your money down.

01:37:13.523 --> 01:37:15.830
- Seven to one, Jack.
-  Seven-one.

01:37:18.093 --> 01:37:19.921
What if he wins?

01:37:24.795 --> 01:37:27.929
Live or die! Live or die!

01:37:27.929 --> 01:37:39.941
Live or die! Live or die!

01:37:41.246 --> 01:37:42.334
Jack!

01:37:42.334 --> 01:37:43.553
Live or die!

01:37:43.553 --> 01:37:44.684
Don't listen to them.

01:37:45.337 --> 01:37:46.469
Look at me.

01:37:50.386 --> 01:37:51.691
Look at me.

01:37:51.691 --> 01:37:53.780
- I'm really fucking scared.
-  Hey.

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:55.043
Look at me. Only me.

01:37:55.043 --> 01:37:58.133
- It's gonna be all right.
- Let's go.

01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:05.662
I don't wanna lose you.

01:38:05.662 --> 01:38:07.098
Don't be scared.

01:38:07.969 --> 01:38:09.274
Look at my eyes.

01:38:09.274 --> 01:38:11.233
I see a storm
on the horizon.

01:38:11.233 --> 01:38:13.235
I want the blood dripping
before the water drops.

01:38:17.630 --> 01:38:18.980
Only this world.

01:38:20.851 --> 01:38:22.244
Only this world.

01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:24.681
- Only this world.

01:38:24.681 --> 01:38:27.684
- Look out!

01:38:35.953 --> 01:38:37.737
Ooh!
That's what I'm talking about.

01:38:37.737 --> 01:38:39.000
- Give him some of that!

01:38:53.014 --> 01:38:54.929
- Yeah!

01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:01.936
-  Oh!
-  Yeah!

01:39:05.591 --> 01:39:07.942
- Come on! Lets's go!

01:39:14.035 --> 01:39:15.253
-  Oh!

01:39:15.253 --> 01:39:16.907
You fucking kick his ass!

01:39:31.356 --> 01:39:33.315
Break his jaw, Jack. Come on.

01:39:51.333 --> 01:39:53.639
- Let's get it.

01:39:53.639 --> 01:39:56.120
Let them hands go.
Let them hands go.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.607
Come on. Come on,
you motherfucker! Come on!

01:40:34.898 --> 01:40:36.247
Come on, Jack.

01:40:55.832 --> 01:40:58.052
Jack. Jack.

01:41:03.666 --> 01:41:05.668
Motherfucker.

01:41:50.582 --> 01:41:52.802
-  Come on!

01:41:52.802 --> 01:41:54.325
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

01:41:57.198 --> 01:41:59.374
Come on, Ax.

01:42:04.422 --> 01:42:06.163
Come on, motherfucker.

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:23.528
Get up! Get up, Jack!

01:42:30.448 --> 01:42:32.450
I know he ain't getting
out of that one, Big Momma.

01:42:43.026 --> 01:42:44.027
Jack!

01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:47.248
Yeah!

01:42:48.901 --> 01:42:51.121
-  Beat his ass!
-  Big Momma,
you seeing this?

01:43:02.698 --> 01:43:04.917
- Ow.

01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:06.397
How long now?

01:43:11.663 --> 01:43:13.143
Come on. You're not giving up.

01:43:13.926 --> 01:43:15.493
-  You got more.

01:43:15.493 --> 01:43:18.540
Stop the damn fight.
Big Momma, stop the damn fight.

01:43:22.674 --> 01:43:25.460
Live or die! Live or die!

01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:30.116
Live or die!
Live or die! Live or die!

01:43:54.967 --> 01:43:58.580
-  Jack!

01:44:37.488 --> 01:44:40.665
Mercy. Mercy!

01:44:41.362 --> 01:44:43.451
- Mercy, goddamn it!
-  Mercy!

01:44:48.499 --> 01:44:50.458
-  Mercy.
Come on! Come on!
-  Yeah!

01:44:52.286 --> 01:44:55.289
-  Mercy! Come on!
-  Come on, Ax, get him!

01:44:57.421 --> 01:45:00.598
-  Come on! Come on!
-  Come on!

01:45:00.598 --> 01:45:01.730
Mercy!

01:45:58.134 --> 01:45:59.918
-  Jack.

01:46:04.096 --> 01:46:05.054
Mama.

01:46:06.142 --> 01:46:07.099
Mama.

01:46:09.928 --> 01:46:11.234
I can't, Mama.

01:46:12.496 --> 01:46:13.889
I'm so sorry.

01:46:13.889 --> 01:46:15.107
It's okay.

01:46:17.153 --> 01:46:19.416
Mama, it's too late.

01:46:27.903 --> 01:46:29.165
He gonna kill me.

01:46:29.774 --> 01:46:30.862
Catch your breath.

01:46:34.126 --> 01:46:35.606
He is coming.

01:46:45.007 --> 01:46:46.443
It's too late.

01:46:48.489 --> 01:46:50.142
It's never too late.

01:47:02.764 --> 01:47:03.808
Bring me home.

01:48:25.673 --> 01:48:27.370
<i>I wish I knew
where I came from.</i>

01:48:33.724 --> 01:48:36.118
Never mind.
I didn't mean it.

01:48:37.162 --> 01:48:38.424
Yes, you did.

01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:42.516
That's something
you'll never truly know.

01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:46.520
We are always looking
for who we are.

01:48:47.477 --> 01:48:49.305
You, me,

01:48:50.306 --> 01:48:51.394
all of us.

01:48:52.177 --> 01:48:54.876
And that doesn't have
anything to do with your blood.

01:49:00.055 --> 01:49:02.274
You'll never stop wanting
to know who you are.

01:49:02.274 --> 01:49:05.364
And as soon as you think
you have it figured out,

01:49:05.364 --> 01:49:07.671
life has a way of tapping you
on the shoulder

01:49:07.671 --> 01:49:09.543
and shifting what you
thought you knew.

01:49:12.328 --> 01:49:13.982
You'll wanna know
who you are...

01:49:15.026 --> 01:49:17.115
today, tomorrow,
and the next day,

01:49:17.115 --> 01:49:18.552
for the rest of your life.

01:49:24.166 --> 01:49:25.559
And that's good, Jack.

01:49:28.474 --> 01:49:29.780
Some days, you'll think about it

01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.303
more than other days.

01:49:34.393 --> 01:49:37.005
It'd be sad to me if you
didn't think about it at all.

01:49:56.502 --> 01:49:58.113
Now what do you see out there?

01:50:02.421 --> 01:50:03.901
I don't know what I see.

01:50:09.037 --> 01:50:10.604
That's why we keep looking.
