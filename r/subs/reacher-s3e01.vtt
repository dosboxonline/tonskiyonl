28:25.746 --> 28:27.622
Did he hit your car and run off?

28:27.623 --> 28:29.041
I don't own a car.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.505
[grunts]

28:35.798 --> 28:37.090
Zachary Beck. You know him?

28:37.091 --> 28:40.427
[Duffy] Shit's sake. Eliot, you don't
give the guy we're questioning

28:40.428 --> 28:43.596
the name of the subject,
then ask if he knows him.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.557
Sorry. Shit.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.560
I don't know him.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.896
You recognize anyone here?

28:51.897 --> 28:53.065
No.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.651
[Duffy] I'll tell you what I think.
I think you saw someone in that car

28:56.652 --> 28:59.070
you did recognize
and now you're looking for them.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.239
So who was it?

29:01.907 --> 29:04.617
[Villanueva] According to Powell,
you were some kind of Army super-cop.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.995
We checked you out.
More awards than Tom Brady.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.121
Fuck that traitor.

29:08.122 --> 29:10.583
That's why we're coming to you now.
We need your help.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.711
Then you really must be desperate.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.172
- Buddy, you don't know the half of it.
- [Reacher] And I don't want to.

29:17.173 --> 29:19.258
At least until you do something for me.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.344
You're not the kind of guy
I wanna do a favor for.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.597
- Why is that?
- You're a pain in the ass.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.182
You answer questions like an asshole.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.810
- You always so direct?
- You always so frustrating?

29:34.648 --> 29:36.733
So what can I do for you, Reacher?

29:36.734 --> 29:38.985
Check hospital records
around Linton, Virginia

29:38.986 --> 29:41.279
on or just after March 13th, 2012.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.865
- What are we looking for?
- An Asian American man in his 40s,

29:43.866 --> 29:45.283
brought in with injuries consistent

29:45.284 --> 29:47.160
with a small-caliber gunshot wound
to the head,

29:47.161 --> 29:49.621
a high fall and drowning.
Look, you're the Feds.

29:49.622 --> 29:52.332
You've got resources.
You find something, call me.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.960
Maybe then we can talk about
what you need.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.047
[duck quacking]

30:01.425 --> 30:03.969
[crickets chirping]

30:07.389 --> 30:09.517
[room phone ringing]

30:12.019 --> 30:14.605
[ringing continues]

30:16.190 --> 30:18.107
So, we found your guy.

30:18.108 --> 30:22.820
Washed up on a beach barely alive
just south of, uh, whatsit, Virginia.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.073
- Linton.
- Whatever.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.908
Wounds matched your description.

30:26.909 --> 30:30.537
Small-caliber bullet lodged in his skull,
massive internal injuries.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.330
Some beachcomber found him.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.707
Doctors figure
the freezin' water saved him.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.793
- Hypothermia.
- Yup.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.211
Slowed his heart so he didn't bleed,

30:38.212 --> 30:40.630
decreased oxygen demand
prevented brain damage.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.883
Took the docs about six months
to put Humpty Dumpty together again.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.261
He tell the medical staff
what happened to him?

30:46.262 --> 30:47.887
Claimed he didn't remember.

30:47.888 --> 30:48.930
File?

30:48.931 --> 30:52.058
Psychiatrists
interviewed the guy regularly

30:52.059 --> 30:53.268
when he was in the hospital.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.645
He stuck to his story.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.605
Do you see anyone else eating?

30:57.606 --> 30:59.774
What? I was at the Kinko's
first thing copying the files,

30:59.775 --> 31:02.277
- I didn't have time for break--
- They diagnosed traumatic amnesia.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.904
Thought he was probably
genuinely blank about the incident

31:04.905 --> 31:06.698
and the previous day or two,

31:06.699 --> 31:09.158
but they figured he must
remember things from before that.

31:09.159 --> 31:12.537
They got the impression
maybe he was pretending not to.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.914
They kept questioning him,
but he never cracked.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.958
Local cops look into it?

31:16.959 --> 31:19.669
County sheriff ran his prints,
but they weren't in the system.

31:19.670 --> 31:23.131
He also didn't match any missing persons
and no one came looking for him,

31:23.132 --> 31:24.632
so he stayed a John Doe.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.509
But from the way you're eye-fucking him,

31:26.510 --> 31:28.137
I think you know his name.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.851
Fuck you, big boy.
I showed you mine, you show me yours.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.477
Or are there no rules where you come from?

31:36.478 --> 31:38.104
I don't really come from anywhere.

31:38.105 --> 31:40.064
Well, I did. And on Emerson Street,

31:40.065 --> 31:42.818
if you didn't do what's right,
you got your ears boxed.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.410
Lieutenant Colonel Francis Xavier Quinn.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.245
Military Intelligence.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.291
Picked up extra cash selling
military secrets to hostile nations.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.209
We were never able to execute an arrest.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.379
- Who threw him off a cliff?
- Maybe an unsatisfied customer.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.049
He was in business with bad people.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.636
If this guy was Army, his fingerprints
should've been in the system.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.304
He had deep connections through M.I.

32:11.305 --> 32:14.057
Figure someone on the inside wiped 'em
from his file when he went on the run.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.851
Photos too, maybe.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.062
You saw Quinn in Beck's car.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.563
Yeah.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.524
[Duffy] And now you wanna find him.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.526
Yeah.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.278
[Duffy] So maybe we can
help each other out.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.073
Let's take a walk.

32:34.328 --> 32:37.205
Look, I think I can trust you,

32:37.206 --> 32:39.625
but I'm trying to figure out for sure.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.251
Why?

32:42.252 --> 32:44.379
Because I screwed up.

32:44.380 --> 32:48.299
Weeks of surveillance on Darien Prado,
he's the L.A. drug dealer,

32:48.300 --> 32:51.260
all inadmissible because of a bad warrant.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.262
How'd that happen?

32:53.263 --> 32:56.557
We surveilled and filmed him
from what we thought was public land--

32:56.558 --> 32:59.143
national forest, middle of nowhere--

32:59.144 --> 33:02.355
but it abutted private property.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.982
We were 20 feet over the line
and didn't know it.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.860
Warrant didn't let us film from there.

33:07.861 --> 33:09.821
You misread the surveyor's map?

33:09.822 --> 33:12.365
It was a real shit show, okay?

33:12.366 --> 33:16.369
Ton of work down the crapper
and the DEA pulled us off the case.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.204
Now you're working it off the books?

33:18.205 --> 33:21.290
[grunts]
I don't let bad guys walk.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.710
And I'm a team leader.
No one's watchin' my day-to-day.

33:23.711 --> 33:26.879
So now you're focused on Beck?

33:26.880 --> 33:30.216
[sighs] Prado flew all the way out here
to meet with him,

33:30.217 --> 33:32.385
so Beck could be a bigger fish.

33:32.386 --> 33:35.513
And if we net him,
we get Prado too, right?

33:35.514 --> 33:38.933
But Beck turned out to be a ghost.
Can't find out shit on him.

33:38.934 --> 33:42.311
So I got the bright idea
to reach out to an old C.I.

33:42.312 --> 33:45.231
Something tells me that didn't
work out like you planned.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.984
It's this kid named Teresa Daniel.

33:47.985 --> 33:50.737
Few years ago, she was tricked
by her scumbag boyfriend

33:50.738 --> 33:53.072
into delivering car parts
stuffed with coke.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.574
She had no idea.

33:54.575 --> 33:58.536
I busted her, flipped her, turned out
to be the best C.I. I ever had.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.039
This kid is so innocent, so unassuming...

34:02.040 --> 34:05.710
- No one suspects she's a plant.
- No one. She's a natural C.I.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.464
So when I saw Bizarre Bazaar had
a help wanted ad online for a secretary,

34:09.465 --> 34:10.965
I called Teresa.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.342
She lives with her grandmother,
she takes care of her,

34:13.343 --> 34:15.762
so I knew she needed money.

34:15.763 --> 34:18.014
She got the job
at Bizarre Bazaar's warehouse

34:18.015 --> 34:21.517
and was gonna just report back
what Beck was up to in there.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.020
But?

34:25.314 --> 34:28.025
About a week ago, she disappeared.

34:29.318 --> 34:32.528
I don't hear from her,
her grandma's got no idea where she is.

34:32.529 --> 34:35.865
She called Bizarre Bazaar, but they
said she never showed up for work,

34:35.866 --> 34:39.286
so the old lady's sure
her granddaughter's using again.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.871
But you think there's more to it.

34:41.872 --> 34:44.832
I know junkies. Teresa was past all that.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.834
She'd turned it around.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.836
I think she got caught snooping on Beck

34:48.837 --> 34:50.880
and something happened to her.

34:50.881 --> 34:53.883
I gotta find out what, but no judge
is gonna issue a warrant

34:53.884 --> 34:56.052
to search a prominent local businessman

34:56.053 --> 34:58.513
over an ex-druggie blowing off work.

34:58.514 --> 35:01.225
Like, she's 20,
but she's still just a kid.

35:03.393 --> 35:06.771
Look. She wears these,
uh, giant hoop earrings

35:06.772 --> 35:08.649
like my niece and her friends.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.569
Why are you showing me this?

35:14.154 --> 35:15.905
'Cause you need to know
what she looks like

35:15.906 --> 35:19.325
when I put you inside Beck's
operation to find her.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.994
I hate to break it to you,
but if Teresa was taken by someone

35:21.995 --> 35:25.164
associated with Xavier Quinn,
odds are you're too late.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.166
Why would you say something
like that to me?

35:27.167 --> 35:28.918
Because you're too smart to lie to.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.045
You'd see through it.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.213
He's that bad?

35:32.214 --> 35:34.423
He's the single worst person
I've ever known.

35:34.424 --> 35:37.051
Well, all the more reason
for you to get on board.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.469
You need to find Quinn.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.764
While you're doing that,
you can help me find Teresa.

35:41.765 --> 35:45.644
You know, I'm not just a pretty face.
I have a plan.

35:48.021 --> 35:50.398
[Duffy] Zachary Beck's son, Richard.

35:50.399 --> 35:52.608
Five years ago, he was kidnapped.

35:52.609 --> 35:55.528
You know how often people
get kidnapped in America these days?

35:55.529 --> 35:58.489
Could be a turf war thing.
Rival drug dealers.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.200
Especially since the kidnappers
cut off the kid's ear

36:01.201 --> 36:04.370
and mailed it to Beck, who,
by the way, never went to the cops.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.581
How do you know about it, then?

36:06.582 --> 36:10.793
Well, you walk around a college campus
with a missing ear and kids ask questions.

36:10.794 --> 36:14.255
Richard answered some of 'em,
and one of his classmates talked

36:14.256 --> 36:16.591
in exchange for us
dropping some minor drug charges.

36:16.592 --> 36:20.344
So the Beck kid's had it rough.
What's he got to do with your plan?

36:20.345 --> 36:22.471
You're gonna get in with Beck

36:22.472 --> 36:24.974
by saving his son
from getting kidnapped again.

36:24.975 --> 36:28.352
- Undercover informant?
- Yeah, what's the problem?

36:28.353 --> 36:30.104
The last one you had went missing.

36:30.105 --> 36:33.983
You remember what I said earlier
about you being an asshole?

36:33.984 --> 36:35.943
You're doing it right now.

36:35.944 --> 36:40.114
[♪ Eli "Paperboy" Reed: "Cut Ya Down"]

36:40.115 --> 36:43.034
[Villanueva] All right, so we get a solid
car from the DEA impound,

36:43.035 --> 36:46.495
ram the hell outta the bodyguard's car,
pin it so that it can't move.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.080
We still gotta deal with the guy.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.874
[Duffy] And he's no pushover either.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.793
Got a jacket and a half:
aggravated assault, armed robbery.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.128
He'll know how to use his gun.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.047
Great. How we gonna
keep from getting shot?

36:56.048 --> 36:58.049
'Cause we can't just kill the man.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.385
Hey, here he is. Gimme.

37:01.803 --> 37:04.221
- What's this shit? I said Dink's.
- A doughnut's a doughnut.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.389
Shut your filthy mouth.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.099
Okay, fine, I'll eat 'em all, then.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.351
Didn't say I didn't want 'em.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.811
- You take your Lipitor today?
- Still waiting on the refill.

37:10.812 --> 37:13.230
Oh.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.025
Let's say the impact
rings the bodyguard's bell.

37:16.026 --> 37:18.653
Doesn't mean he won't get a few shots off.

37:18.654 --> 37:21.907
Duffy's right. We need more.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.618
In Kuwait, we'd used flashbang grenades

37:25.619 --> 37:28.496
when we wanted to keep
a target alive for interrogation.

37:28.497 --> 37:31.749
Bodyguard won't be seriously injured,
but he'll be in no condition to retaliate.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.711
It'll blow out the windows,
really sell the lie to Richard.

37:35.712 --> 37:38.714
And it'll create a job opening.
Beck will need a new bodyguard.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.508
Okay, sorry. I'm confused.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.218
- Shocking.
- [Eliot] If the bodyguard
isn't really dead,

37:42.219 --> 37:44.553
he can just go tell Beck
what actually happened.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.973
So how do we get around that?

37:46.974 --> 37:49.016
We hold him indefinitely.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.686
Without so much
as the right to a phone call.

37:51.687 --> 37:54.605
Pretty sure the Constitution
says you can't do that.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.023
[Reacher] You're DEA.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.484
Grab some drugs from Evidence,
plant it in his car,

37:58.485 --> 38:00.778
say he was buying it from
some Central American dealer,

38:00.779 --> 38:02.405
then it becomes a narco-terrorism case.

38:02.406 --> 38:03.864
You can hold him as long as you want

38:03.865 --> 38:05.575
without formal charges
and no right to an attorney.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.328
- The law allows for that?
- It's kind of a gray area.

38:09.329 --> 38:12.541
A mouse's asshole is a gray area.
This is barely legal.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.585
But I don't think we have a choice.

38:16.586 --> 38:19.131
And while we got him,
we can question him. Good idea.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.259
Not just a pretty face.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.013
Okay, that takes care of our bodyguard.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.515
Who's playing our kidnapper?

38:31.852 --> 38:32.977
I'll do it.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.855
[scoffs] No. This one's
out of your comfort zone, precious.

38:35.856 --> 38:38.566
