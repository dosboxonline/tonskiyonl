to get him here.
Does that make sense?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.836
It does.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.214
Hmm.
He's a grown‐up now.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.091
He's gonna make
his own choices,

41:50.091 --> 41:53.011
even if I don't like
what those choices are.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.555
John, I'm gonna watch out
for him, okay?

41:55.555 --> 41:58.182
I know you will.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.434
To college dropouts.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.436
Actually, I went back to school
to get my degree.

42:01.436 --> 42:02.812
Mm?

42:02.812 --> 42:04.647
Good for you.

42:04.647 --> 42:06.983
Is your professor hot?
No comment.

42:06.983 --> 42:09.652
Oh, that's a yes.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.821
Oh, come sit down.
We need to talk.

42:11.821 --> 42:12.655
What are you studying?

42:12.655 --> 42:13.906
Ethics.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.324
Mm. Indeed.
Was she ethical?

42:15.324 --> 42:16.534
Yes.
