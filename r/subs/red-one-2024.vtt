Excuse me.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.124
What is this?

01:20.125 --> 01:22.415
Like I said, we're being played.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.374
Now, pay up.

01:25.375 --> 01:26.790
How'd you even find this stuff?

01:26.791 --> 01:28.999
I can find anything or anyone.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.790
Then why can't you find your dad?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.333
Hilarious, Gene.

01:33.833 --> 01:37.999
Look, I don't know what all this stuff is,
but Santa is coming tonight.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.915
Okay, can we talk about that for a minute?

01:39.916 --> 01:41.208
Jack O'Malley.

01:43.375 --> 01:44.458
Kids, go downstairs.

01:45.541 --> 01:47.333
Not you.

01:49.333 --> 01:50.707
What are you doing, pal?

01:50.708 --> 01:53.582
Look, we love having you here
for the holidays,

01:53.583 --> 01:55.290
but what are you telling your cousins?

01:55.291 --> 01:56.833
The cold, hard truth.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.415
Cold, hard truth?

02:01.416 --> 02:03.624
Jack, these are presents, yes,

02:03.625 --> 02:05.790
- but these aren't Santa's presents.
- Right.

02:05.791 --> 02:08.707
Because Santa Claus hasn't been here yet.

02:08.708 --> 02:10.708
It's Christmas Eve. He's coming tonight.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.082
He's coming here, to this house, tonight?

02:16.083 --> 02:18.499
- That's what you're telling me?
- That's what I'm telling you.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.749
And he's also going
to every other house in the world

02:21.750 --> 02:23.624
on the same night,

02:23.625 --> 02:26.040
using flying reindeer for transportation?

02:26.041 --> 02:27.207
Yes, Jack.

02:27.208 --> 02:30.416
And what fuels a flying reindeer exactly?

02:32.625 --> 02:34.165
Carrots.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.749
Okay, look, I don't know
exactly how it works.

02:36.750 --> 02:42.625
All I know is, when we wake up tomorrow,
Santa will have been here.

02:43.708 --> 02:45.457
All right.

02:45.458 --> 02:46.832
Let's go.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.999
You don't want to get
on the Naughty List, do you?

02:49.000 --> 02:53.166
Honestly, Uncle Rick,
I'm not that worried about it.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.458
Christine,
triple-shot Americano.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.665
Jack O'Malley.
I don't believe it.

03:45.666 --> 03:47.499
Lenny. Do you miss me?

03:47.500 --> 03:49.499
- Where's my money?
- I'm getting you your money.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.332
I told you I'm gonna get you your money.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.915
I'm on a job right now.

03:52.916 --> 03:55.165
In fact, I'm planning on doubling it.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.040
You still got Morris at plus-300?

03:57.041 --> 03:58.957
Morris? That stiff?

03:58.958 --> 04:00.707
Put me down for 25K.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.832
You got a lot of balls, O'Malley.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.916
I know. Brains, too.
It doesn't seem fair, does it?

04:17.500 --> 04:18.833
All right.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.249
Good. Feel it.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.832

07:27.833 --> 07:30.582
Got a 5-11, male grown-up,
hovering by the scented candles.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.874
Keep an eye out.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.583
Copy, chief.
I got eyes on him.

07:34.666 --> 07:36.707
Hi, Santa. We made cookies for you.

07:36.708 --> 07:38.541
Thank you.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.749
Chocolate chip and snickerdoodle.

I love snickerdoodle.

07:45.708 --> 07:46.790
How'd you know?

07:46.791 --> 07:48.207
- I made them myself.
- I helped.

07:48.208 --> 07:51.124
You know what? I've been meaning
to talk to you guys. Come here a minute.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.332
We're live! Yo, it's your boy, Beef Stew.

07:53.333 --> 07:56.332
And we're here at Christmas at the mall

07:56.333 --> 07:58.624
with the boy, the GOAT, Santa.

07:58.625 --> 08:01.124
And we're gonna get him
to put on Stew Crew T-shirt.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.790
Sir, you can't cut the line.

08:02.791 --> 08:04.665
Ah, what's the matter, big dude?

08:04.666 --> 08:07.040
You don't want to show
some Christmas love to the Beef?

08:07.041 --> 08:08.957
These kids have been waiting a long time.

08:08.958 --> 08:11.040
Look, man, it'll take two minutes.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.124
He puts on the shirt, and he says,
"Now we beefin'."

08:13.125 --> 08:14.874
- Sir.
- I'm a big deal.

08:14.875 --> 08:17.165
I have over 3,000 followers.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.790
I'm gonna make your boy famous.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.540
Just got to put the shirt on.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.249
He's already quite famous.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.790
Don't be a total--

08:23.791 --> 08:27.750
Sir, you can't cut the line.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.375
Have I made myself clear?

08:33.458 --> 08:34.582
Yes, very clear.

08:34.583 --> 08:38.582
Now, I wish you a merry Christmas.

08:38.583 --> 08:39.999
Yeah.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.208
Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna go. Um, yep.

08:43.291 --> 08:46.916
Now, you guys have
a very important appointment with Santa.

08:48.625 --> 08:49.999
Man, I needed that.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.290
So important to get out
and talk to the kids.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.540
Best part of the job.

08:53.541 --> 08:55.082
It's Santa!

08:55.083 --> 08:57.582
Nothing like a crowded mall
two days before Christmas.

08:57.583 --> 09:00.125
Yo, Santa, man! Merry Christmas!

09:01.208 --> 09:02.415
Merry Christmas, pal.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.750
♪ Man, it doesn't show signs of...

09:06.375 --> 09:07.874
Tell me you're not gonna miss this.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.624
God! What do you mean
you're sold out of essential oils?

09:10.625 --> 09:12.707
I'm gonna bash someone's skull in.

09:12.708 --> 09:14.665
I'm not gonna miss this.

09:14.666 --> 09:16.124

09:17.500 --> 09:19.374
Freddy, secondary array.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.165
Hundred-and-eighty-degree spread. Go.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.083
- Copy that.
- Copy that.
Red One is on the move.

09:24.541 --> 09:27.790
Vampire Assassin 4 is hot this year.

09:27.791 --> 09:30.332
- Thanks, Ginerva.
- Sure thing, Red.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.040
Carl, you got any milk up there?

09:32.041 --> 09:33.790
Of course, Red.

09:33.791 --> 09:35.625
I always love coming to Philly.

09:36.958 --> 09:39.125
You think we have time
to stop for a cheesesteak?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.374
Won't be the same without you, Cal.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.500
It'll be exactly the same without me.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.166
Stubborn pain in the butt.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.832
General.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.665
Red, good to see you.

10:19.666 --> 10:21.832
- Successful excursion?
- Yes, sir.

10:21.833 --> 10:24.999
The mall at Christmastime
is like oxygen for me.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.250
Thank you.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.625
Evening, ladies.

10:46.541 --> 10:48.958
What are you so excited about?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.499
Oh. Of course.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.458
Your boyfriend's here.

10:56.541 --> 10:58.749
Hey, girls.

10:58.750 --> 11:02.165
Okay. Okay.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.875
Of course I didn't forget.

11:04.958 --> 11:06.833
Yes, I brought extra.

11:07.916 --> 11:09.000
Who's hungry?

11:10.083 --> 11:11.916
There we go.

11:16.666 --> 11:17.999
Cal.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.375
Come on, man. Clock's ticking.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.874
Red One, you are clear for takeoff.

11:51.875 --> 11:54.332
All right, ladies.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.791
Let's go home.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.207
Thanks for the escort, fellas.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.583
See you next year.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.416
Kavalame!

13:01.333 --> 13:03.416
Come on, Morris.

13:21.458 --> 13:22.707
Go ahead.

13:22.708 --> 13:23.790
I got it.

13:23.791 --> 13:25.624
I don't know what the hell it is,
but I got it.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.165
Send the coordinates.

13:27.166 --> 13:31.207
Well, why don't you
send something my way first?

13:31.208 --> 13:35.958
Wiring the first half now,
the rest when the data is verified.

13:37.833 --> 13:39.332
Pleasure doing business with you.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.874
Yes! Yes!

13:41.875 --> 13:43.124
Yes!

13:43.125 --> 13:44.415
He's staggering.

13:44.416 --> 13:45.708
- He's in the corner!
- No.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.790
- No.
- Morris is down!

13:48.791 --> 13:52.083
No! Oh, my God.

14:21.958 --> 14:23.875
Home sweet home.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.791
Whoa, ladies.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.250
- Red, welcome back.
- Thank you.

15:18.458 --> 15:20.083
Where's the missus?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.165
I'm-I'm right here.

15:24.166 --> 15:25.915
Deliverables was a half hour ago.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.124
Larry, this is going to Bermuda.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.582
Copy that. Bermuda.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.249
Garcia.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.458
Welcome back, chief.

15:34.541 --> 15:36.207
- What'd I miss?
- Nothing.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.999
Everyone's working.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.415
There's a bottleneck in ribbons.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.624
Phil is blaming wrapping.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.415
Wrapping says Phil's being overdramatic.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.290
Everybody's feeling the heat.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.582
All right. I'll talk to him.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.582
Please. Phil's driving everybody nuts.

15:48.583 --> 15:51.332
Phil in ribbons
is having a total meltdown.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.999
Maybe it's time to find
a less stressful spot for Phil.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.290
I don't know, tinsel?

15:55.291 --> 15:56.749
Phil out of ribbons?

15:56.750 --> 15:58.040
Just a thought.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.540
He's got a dog named Ribbons.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.708
Yeah, right.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.582
Four ninety-five. Four ninety-six.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.582
Four ninety-seven. Four ninety-eight.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.291
Four ninety-nine. Five hundred.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.165
In five minutes. Not bad.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.749
Yeah, getting warmed up.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.124
All right,
I'm gonna run the simulation model

16:14.125 --> 16:16.832
on Belgium and Holland again
just to be safe.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.040
- Thank you, sweetie.
- All right, if you need me, yell.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.124
Hey, Callum. Jump in there.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.624
Get him ready, okay?

16:22.625 --> 16:25.208
- It's almost showtime.
- Yes, ma'am. Will do.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.124
Hey, boss.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.958
Cal.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.708
- Give me a spot, huh?
- Got it.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.875
Up.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.708
Tell me why.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.540
Time for a change, Nick.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.249
- It's like I told you.
- Yeah, I heard you.

17:16.250 --> 17:19.708
And I'll respect your decision,
but I want to know why.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.750
- Let's go heavy.
- Yeah. Got it.

17:27.416 --> 17:29.207
You're looking strong.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.207
We work for the kids, Cal.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.082
We do it for them.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.415
And I know you love that.

17:34.416 --> 17:36.500
You live for that.

17:37.791 --> 17:39.832
So, what's going on here?

17:39.833 --> 17:41.958
I love the kids.

17:43.125 --> 17:45.791
It's the grown-ups that are killing me.

17:47.791 --> 17:49.000
Go on.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.415
- The list.
- What about the list?

17:52.416 --> 17:54.707
We're up almost 22% year over year.

17:54.708 --> 17:57.249
I'm aware of the numbers, Cal.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.541
What are you getting at?

18:00.250 --> 18:03.665
For the first time ever, more people
are on the Naughty List than not.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.791
And it's like they don't even care.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.750
So much bad behavior out there
everywhere you look.

18:12.416 --> 18:14.833
Uh, you say it all the time, Nick.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.957
We choose every day who we want to be.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.249
With big decisions and little ones,

18:22.250 --> 18:24.583
and every one of them matters.

18:27.166 --> 18:30.708
But I look around,
and they act like none of it matters.

18:32.791 --> 18:37.416
If nothing matters to them, it seems to me
they need us now more than ever.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.875
That's why there's only one you.

18:42.958 --> 18:47.165
And no one with my doubts
should be so close to you.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.249
You need somebody younger,

18:49.250 --> 18:53.040
someone 300 years old, in their prime,
who wants to change things.

18:53.041 --> 18:56.082
Not our job to change people, Cal.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.999
People change themselves.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.499
We just show 'em that we believe in 'em.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.499
All of 'em.

19:02.500 --> 19:06.915
'Cause we know who they really are,
down deep.

19:06.916 --> 19:11.249
We know that somewhere
inside every lost grown-up

19:11.250 --> 19:13.249
is the kid they once were.

19:13.250 --> 19:18.375
Our gift is that we can see that,
even when they can't.

19:21.166 --> 19:24.249
We work for the kids, Cal,

19:24.250 --> 19:27.000
even when they're not kids anymore.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.833
I'm just having a really hard time
seeing it.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.041
And that's why.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.208
Let's have a cookie.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.000
The answer to everything.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.582
Got to carb up.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.249
You know, I burn about 400--

19:48.250 --> 19:50.415
You burn 430 million calories
every Christmas Eve.

19:50.416 --> 19:52.833
- Yeah.
- Yes, I know.

19:53.916 --> 19:55.708
One last ride, huh?

19:56.791 --> 19:58.208
One last ride.

20:06.416 --> 20:07.833
Mmm.

20:36.666 --> 20:37.833
Here!

20:38.958 --> 20:40.791
Get to it, Lads.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.457
Alpha check. It's Drift.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.915
Looks like a light just fried
on the anterior west face

21:54.916 --> 21:56.540
up around mail room 19-B.

21:56.541 --> 21:57.707
Anyone up there?

21:57.708 --> 21:59.457
Yeah,
this is Jeff in maintenance.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.165
You don't miss a thing, Commander.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.416
- I'll check it out.
- Thanks, Jeff.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.415
Hey, Jeff, looks like we got
a few more of 'em, too.

22:11.416 --> 22:13.458
What's going on up there?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.250
Jeff?

22:17.333 --> 22:18.916
Jeff, do you copy?

22:20.625 --> 22:21.790
Who's with Red?

22:21.791 --> 22:23.374
Arthur,
is he still with you?

22:23.375 --> 22:24.540
Negative, chief.

22:24.541 --> 22:27.500
- Kenny, do you have him?
- Not in the gym.

22:29.208 --> 22:30.915
Who's with Red?

22:30.916 --> 22:32.540
Gorman, are you in the residence?

22:32.541 --> 22:33.957
Finkle just took over.

22:33.958 --> 22:36.040
Finkle. Finkle!

22:36.041 --> 22:38.666
I need eyes on Red now!

22:41.500 --> 22:43.624
- Mail room, negative.
- Study, negative.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.999
Mistletoe hydroponics, negative.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.416
He's not in the gallery.

22:49.666 --> 22:52.040
Logistics, negative.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.332
Anteroom, negative.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.707
Candy cane packaging, negative.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.125
Nursery, negative.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.416
Nick. Nick!

23:18.791 --> 23:20.582
Breach!

23:20.583 --> 23:22.708
- We have a breach!
- Does anyone have eyes?

23:40.208 --> 23:42.833
Code green! Code green! Full lockdown!

23:43.916 --> 23:45.707
Armored snowcat heading north.

23:45.708 --> 23:47.415
Copy that.

23:47.416 --> 23:49.415
- Locating.
- Who has eyes?

23:49.416 --> 23:50.915
- Just turned right on Pine.
- Copy.

23:50.916 --> 23:53.166
Containment barrier five going up.

23:57.416 --> 23:58.750
Street unit six, deploy.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.333
Box 'em in!

24:16.458 --> 24:17.583
Agents down.

24:28.666 --> 24:30.957
Raise barrier 72!

24:30.958 --> 24:32.708
Raising 72.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.083
Snowcat just turned left on Candlestick.

25:21.708 --> 25:24.166
There's a hole in the dome.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.707
What the hell just happened?

26:38.708 --> 26:40.582
- There's been a breach, Director.
- I know.

26:40.583 --> 26:43.374
Red has been taken.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.707
What? Where's Cal?

26:45.708 --> 26:47.540
- I'm right here.
- Cal, what happened?

26:47.541 --> 26:49.665
- Who could've done this?
- Zoe, I don't know.

26:49.666 --> 26:51.082
We are 24 hours to Christmas Eve.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.750
- We cannot--
- Yes, I'm well aware.

26:53.875 --> 26:57.083
Okay. Okay, let's take a deep breath.

26:58.458 --> 26:59.915
Start from the beginning.

26:59.916 --> 27:03.582
They cut a hole in the CF Dome
using an atomic plasma torch.

27:03.583 --> 27:06.957
From the footprints, I'd say
there's eight to ten of them-- human.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.207
They rolled in
on a remote armored snowcat,

27:09.208 --> 27:11.540
which they used as a diversion
before they blasted out of here

27:11.541 --> 27:13.082
in a NORAD-blind cargo jet.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.374
Good God, Cal.

27:14.375 --> 27:15.957
I'm gonna find 'em, Zoe.

27:15.958 --> 27:17.750
We're gonna work together on this.

27:18.833 --> 27:20.790
We were just told that someone hacked

27:20.791 --> 27:22.332
the Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.

27:22.333 --> 27:25.165
I don't know if it's related,
but if someone knew where to look,

27:25.166 --> 27:27.165
that's the only vulnerability
in the cloaking.

27:27.166 --> 27:28.790
Who?

27:28.791 --> 27:31.332
We don't know yet.
The trolls are scouring the Web.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.207
Name and address.

27:33.208 --> 27:34.457
They're working on it.

27:34.458 --> 27:37.040
Then tell 'em to work faster.
We don't have time for this.

27:37.041 --> 27:39.374
Director, the trolls have a trace.

27:39.375 --> 27:40.749
Patch them in.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.249
What have you got?

27:42.250 --> 27:43.415
We traced the relays.

27:43.416 --> 27:44.583
Looks like The Wolf.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.082
The Wolf.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.249
Who the hell is The Wolf?

27:50.250 --> 27:53.749
Mercenary, bounty hunter,
works for the highest bidder.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.624
A ghost on the dark web.

27:55.625 --> 27:58.791
FBI's been trying to recruit him
for years, but he's a freelancer.

27:59.875 --> 28:02.291
He's probably
the best tracker in the world.

28:03.375 --> 28:04.458
The guy's a legend.

28:18.375 --> 28:19.457
What?

28:19.458 --> 28:21.290
Nice. Are you in town?

28:21.291 --> 28:22.457
That depends.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.290
- What do you want?
- I need you to do me a favor

28:24.291 --> 28:25.624
and go pick up Dylan.

28:25.625 --> 28:27.332
I'm right in the middle
of something important.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.082
This isn't a good time for me.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.374
Yeah. Me, either.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.457
I have two mothers-to-be
with weakening contractions

28:32.458 --> 28:34.665
and labor that's not progressing,
and Craig's out of town.

28:34.666 --> 28:36.165
Liv.

28:36.166 --> 28:37.332
Dylan got in trouble at school.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.707
I just need you to go pick him up
and drop him off at my place.

28:39.708 --> 28:41.082
- Liv.
- Jack.

28:41.083 --> 28:42.582
I'm stuck at work, and Craig's away,

28:42.583 --> 28:45.000
so just do me a favor
and go pick up your kid.

29:00.333 --> 29:02.666
I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it.

29:03.916 --> 29:06.041
Hey, buddy.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.582
- Hey, you got any aspirin?
- What?

29:11.583 --> 29:13.541
No.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.082
I got to get
something in my stomach.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.958
- You want a churro?
- No.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.125
Shut up!

29:24.625 --> 29:27.082
Hey, man. Can I get two?

29:27.083 --> 29:29.916
- I don't want a churro.
- I heard you. They're for me.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.790
So, what are they saying you did?

29:33.791 --> 29:37.415
Tampered with the school's
attendance records, which I did.

29:37.416 --> 29:39.207
Allegedly.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.082
Never admit that.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.499
Thank you. Have a good day.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
Yeah, yeah.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.457
The music teacher leaves his computer open
during fifth period.

29:50.458 --> 29:51.915
Mm-hmm.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.915
I started to ditch science
so I could go and practice guitar,

29:53.916 --> 29:55.165
then I'd change it on the computer.

29:55.166 --> 29:56.665
Makes sense.

29:56.666 --> 29:59.915
There's this girl in jazz band, Piper.

29:59.916 --> 30:02.624
She started to ditch with me,
but then Kevin--

30:02.625 --> 30:03.915
Who's Kevin?

30:03.916 --> 30:05.957
My best friend. At least he was.

30:05.958 --> 30:07.374
What'd Kevin do?

30:07.375 --> 30:09.124
Kevin found out and wanted to ditch, too.

30:09.125 --> 30:10.749
But he's not even in jazz band.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.457
He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

30:12.458 --> 30:14.249
I was the one hanging out with Piper.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.540
So I'm supposed to go in
and change his absent to present

30:16.541 --> 30:19.040
- so he can hang out with Piper?
- It's bullshit.

30:19.041 --> 30:21.124
So, instead,
I gave him three more absents.

30:21.125 --> 30:23.332
Good. Send a message.

30:23.333 --> 30:24.790
He got busted and told the vice principal.

30:24.791 --> 30:26.500
Kevin.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.166
So I slashed the tires on his bike.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.000
- I know, you're disappointed.
- I am disappointed.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.040
Look, if you're gonna hack a mainframe,
you do it quietly.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.582
You go in through a back door,
no fingerprints.

30:41.583 --> 30:44.040
But more importantly,
the second this kid Kevin

30:44.041 --> 30:46.665
knew what you were doing,
you got a loose end.

30:46.666 --> 30:49.832
Never trust anybody. Anybody.

30:49.833 --> 30:53.375
And never let someone get the upper hand
on you, 'cause they'll use it.

30:56.791 --> 30:57.791
Yeah.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.124
All right, I got to go practice.

31:08.125 --> 31:11.207
I have this dumb winter pageant thing
tonight for jazz band.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.499
A pageant? Oof.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.165
I know.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.124
I said it was dumb.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.250
Good luck.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.750
- We're gonna talk when I come in.
- I know.

31:25.833 --> 31:28.582
- Thought labor wasn't progressing.
- Yeah, then it did.

31:28.583 --> 31:30.540
Thanks for picking him up, though.

31:30.541 --> 31:33.332
I don't know what's going on
with him these days. He's acting out.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.749
Yeah, well, you know, growing up is tough.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.665
Is that why you're avoiding it?

31:37.666 --> 31:40.040
- I walked right into that.
- Yeah.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.624
Yeah.

31:41.625 --> 31:43.124
He'd really love to see you
more often, Jack.

31:43.125 --> 31:44.582
I just picked him up.

31:44.583 --> 31:46.665
- I know.
- It was really nice. We had a good talk.

31:46.666 --> 31:48.665
He told me about school.
I mean, I don't know what--

31:48.666 --> 31:50.624
He would love that to happen more often,
is all I'm saying.

31:50.625 --> 31:51.958
I got to go to work.

31:53.750 --> 31:55.499
Okay.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.000
Merry Christmas, Jack.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.415
Yeah.

32:00.416 --> 32:03.166
"Merry Christmas, Jack."

Hi, Jack.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.999
We know what you did.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.624
Huh?

34:51.625 --> 34:53.250
We know what you did.

34:58.833 --> 35:00.666
Okay. Um...

35:02.250 --> 35:05.041
First of all, sorry.

35:06.208 --> 35:09.040
Second, could you be more specific?

35:09.041 --> 35:11.624
Honestly, you could be talking
about 12 different things right now.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.125
Who are you working for?

35:14.708 --> 35:16.832
Lady, I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:16.833 --> 35:18.582
I work for whoever pays me.

35:18.583 --> 35:19.957
You have about 40 seconds

35:19.958 --> 35:22.332
to become helpful
before you have a terrible accident,

35:22.333 --> 35:24.665
so I'm gonna ask you one more time:

35:24.666 --> 35:26.915
Who hired you to find him?

35:26.916 --> 35:28.457
- Find who?
- You know who.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.040
I promise you I don't.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.540
If I did, I would tell you.

35:31.541 --> 35:33.791
I'm not a scrupulous person.
You can ask anybody.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.874
The Intercontinental
Seismic Surveillance System.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.083
Sound familiar?

35:41.791 --> 35:43.957
Yeah. I did that.

35:43.958 --> 35:45.165
It was a weird job.

35:45.166 --> 35:47.249
Somebody was trying to find someone
who was running tests

35:47.250 --> 35:50.207
on some weapons systems
in the arctic, and I...

35:50.208 --> 35:52.374
I found the location, and I walked.

35:52.375 --> 35:53.665
For who?

35:53.666 --> 35:55.040
I don't know.

35:55.041 --> 35:58.207
I'm telling you, all the communication
is encrypted and untraceable.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.957
That's how it's supposed to be

35:59.958 --> 36:02.916
so if someone like you shows up
I don't have any answers.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.457
Look, I don't ask questions.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.749
I just find people
that no one else can find.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.291
It's what I do.

36:14.125 --> 36:16.790
You really don't know what you did.

36:16.791 --> 36:19.165
I guess not.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.458
I mean, I can tell
you're very upset about it, though.

36:26.083 --> 36:27.332
Box him up.

36:27.333 --> 36:28.874
Box me up?

36:28.875 --> 36:30.458
Wait, wait. What do you mean? Hey.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.750
Is this really necessary?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.791
Ow.

37:03.041 --> 37:04.290
Cool place.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.500
How long you been here?

37:07.666 --> 37:08.790
M-O-R-A?

37:08.791 --> 37:10.249
MORA.

37:10.250 --> 37:12.749
The Mythological Oversight
and Restoration Authority.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.332
Come again?

37:14.333 --> 37:16.374
We are the multilateral
international organization

37:16.375 --> 37:19.625
responsible for securing and protecting
the mythological world.

37:21.708 --> 37:22.833
Come with me.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.249
- Did you say "the mythological world"?
- Yes.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.374
Right.

37:29.375 --> 37:33.124
So, uh, bigfoot,

37:33.125 --> 37:35.749
Loch Ness Monster, that kind of thing?

37:35.750 --> 37:37.082
That kind of thing.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.499
Okay, so...

37:39.500 --> 37:42.665
things that don't actually exist,
you guys are responsible for.

37:42.666 --> 37:44.041
Got it.

37:45.791 --> 37:47.166
Holy shit!

38:01.333 --> 38:03.207
If he knows anything, he ain't talking.

38:03.208 --> 38:05.790
All right. Horse back to the pen,
body back to Area 32.

38:05.791 --> 38:07.915
And get the pumpkin
back in the cryo-vault stat.

38:07.916 --> 38:09.499
Yes, Director.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.124
What the hell was that?

38:11.125 --> 38:12.415
The Horseman.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.958
We're questioning all the usual suspects.

38:16.541 --> 38:18.875
The Headless Horseman?

38:19.958 --> 38:22.665
Hey. What did that
Taser thing do to my head?

38:22.666 --> 38:24.874
It's not a Taser. It's an Acquiescer.

38:24.875 --> 38:27.833
Just take a deep breath
and have a seat, Jack.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.458
What am I doing here?

38:50.916 --> 38:54.540
Last night, at roughly 11:00 p.m. NPST,

38:54.541 --> 38:58.374
Red One, also known
as Saint Nicholas of Myra,

38:58.375 --> 39:01.291
was abducted from the North Pole complex.

39:04.500 --> 39:08.957
The data you retrieved from the I-Triple-S
was used to pinpoint the location,

39:08.958 --> 39:12.166
which has been secure and classified
for several hundred years.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.165
Use your words.

39:22.166 --> 39:25.540
Are you saying...

39:25.541 --> 39:29.165
Santa Claus has been kidnapped?

39:29.166 --> 39:31.707
And you think I had
something to do with it?

39:31.708 --> 39:33.000
Where is he?

39:36.250 --> 39:37.375
Is that him?

39:38.791 --> 39:43.041
Jack "The Wolf" O'Malley,
meet Callum Drift, commander of the E.L.F.

39:44.125 --> 39:45.540
The E.L.F.?

39:45.541 --> 39:47.290
Turns out Jack here didn't know
what he was doing.

39:47.291 --> 39:50.499
Somebody hired him to find the complex,
and incredibly, he did.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.915
Who?

39:51.916 --> 39:53.624
- He doesn't know.
- I don't know.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.874
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.832
They always know something.

39:57.833 --> 40:00.041
Sometimes you just
got to shake it out of 'em.

40:01.250 --> 40:03.124
I'm not gonna like you.

40:03.125 --> 40:06.125
I can tell right away, out of
everyone here, I like you the least.

40:07.458 --> 40:08.625
Garcia.

40:12.875 --> 40:14.957
What the...

40:14.958 --> 40:16.624
Yeah, chief.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.499
- This guy's not cooperating.
- Ah.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.249
Should we do the thing?

40:20.250 --> 40:21.749
I'm afraid we're gonna have to.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.665
- Cal, let's talk about this for a minute.
- There's nothing to talk about.

40:23.666 --> 40:25.415
You can't trust this guy.
He's on the list.

40:25.416 --> 40:27.499
- What list?
- You know damn well what list.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.583
Look, I'm not on any watch list.
I know for a fact that...

40:30.750 --> 40:32.665
Wait a minute.

40:32.666 --> 40:33.832
You don't mean--

40:33.833 --> 40:35.957
Yes, that list. You're on it. I checked.

40:35.958 --> 40:37.790
- NL-Four.
- Are you telling me

40:37.791 --> 40:41.040
this clown is a Level Four Naughty Lister?

40:41.041 --> 40:44.624
- A Level Four Naughty Lister?
- Oh, is that funny to you?

40:44.625 --> 40:46.624
Hey, hey, hey. What are we doing here?

40:46.625 --> 40:48.415
- Come on.
- I know this is killing you,

40:48.416 --> 40:49.749
but you have to trust me.

40:49.750 --> 40:51.290
Dismembering this shit bag
isn't gonna help.

40:51.291 --> 40:53.915
It would feel good, but it won't help.

40:53.916 --> 40:55.124
I'm right here.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.208
Shut up.

40:58.208 --> 41:00.582
- What are you thinking?
- We're gonna put him to work.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.165
- No, absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

41:03.166 --> 41:05.790
You said you work for whoever pays you.

41:05.791 --> 41:06.874
Today that's me.

41:06.875 --> 41:08.832
He's not telling us everything he knows.
Look at him.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.124
He is telling us
everything he knows.

41:10.125 --> 41:11.415
He just doesn't know who hired him.

41:11.416 --> 41:14.957
Well, I mean,
how much are we talking here?

41:14.958 --> 41:17.665
Garcia.

41:17.666 --> 41:22.457
Okay. I don't know who it was,
but I can figure out where they are.

41:22.458 --> 41:24.833
Or where they were last night.

41:25.916 --> 41:27.833
God.

41:30.625 --> 41:34.207
Look, it is anonymous--
I don't know who it is--

41:34.208 --> 41:38.915
but in my line of work, I need insurance,
you know, in case of billing issues,

41:38.916 --> 41:41.082
so I Trojan-horse a digital tracking bug

41:41.083 --> 41:42.832
- into their VPN.
- Are you saying--

41:42.833 --> 41:43.957
Yeah, I can track the device.

41:43.958 --> 41:45.374
Then I suggest you do it.

41:45.375 --> 41:47.124
Can we circle back
on the whole paying me thing?

41:47.125 --> 41:49.124
I know what they paid you.
We'll double it.

41:49.125 --> 41:51.249
- Triple.
- Garcia.

41:51.250 --> 41:52.915
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on!

41:52.916 --> 41:56.249
All right, all right. Double's fine.
It's Christmas.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.415
Wise choice.

41:57.416 --> 41:59.083
I need my cell phone.

42:05.666 --> 42:08.415
Whoever did this...

42:08.416 --> 42:10.249
- is in Aruba.
- Where in Aruba?

42:10.250 --> 42:11.499
I work alone.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.457
- You used to.
- No offense,

42:13.458 --> 42:16.290
but I'm not rolling into Aruba undercover
with a giant elf.

42:16.291 --> 42:18.290
It's E.L.F.!

42:18.291 --> 42:20.332
- Cal.
- We can't trust this guy.

42:20.333 --> 42:22.332
That's why you're holding the leash.

42:22.333 --> 42:23.583
And this...

42:25.166 --> 42:27.582
...is how I can find you
anywhere on Earth.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.374
You're mine until we find him.

42:29.375 --> 42:31.166
I suggest you get going.

42:33.666 --> 42:36.416
Claws!

43:01.041 --> 43:03.124
Well, this is unfortunate.

43:03.125 --> 43:06.582
No, this is what needed to be done.

43:06.583 --> 43:08.958
I sincerely doubt that.

43:10.416 --> 43:14.541
You know, I know a guy
who's gonna be very upset about this.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.083
What are you gonna do with that?

43:23.166 --> 43:26.041
The world is a mess
because they fear nothing.

43:27.916 --> 43:30.750
I'm going to give them something to fear.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.915
I'm going to do in one night

43:34.916 --> 43:38.874
what you have failed to do for centuries.

43:38.875 --> 43:40.957
And what is that?

43:40.958 --> 43:43.500
I'm gonna make the world a better place.

43:53.666 --> 43:54.749
What are you doing?

43:54.750 --> 43:57.125
Borrowing some of your energy.

44:00.041 --> 44:01.458
Now...

44:02.833 --> 44:05.333
...go to sleep, Nicholas.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.791
Go to sleep.

44:38.291 --> 44:40.707
We doing some last-minute
Christmas shopping?

44:40.708 --> 44:42.374
Gearing up.

44:42.375 --> 44:43.958
Grab a car, something practical.

44:45.625 --> 44:49.250
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la,
deck the halls...

44:57.083 --> 44:58.083
Here.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.833
Let's go.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.915
♪ Strike the harp and join the chorus ♪

45:12.916 --> 45:15.999
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪

45:16.000 --> 45:18.665
♪ Follow me in merry measure ♪

45:18.666 --> 45:20.790
♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la...

45:20.791 --> 45:21.958
Ooh!

45:39.500 --> 45:41.749
What the hell just happened?

45:41.750 --> 45:44.083
Toy stores.

45:45.166 --> 45:46.749
Toy stores what?

45:46.750 --> 45:48.707
The supply closets are portal stations

45:48.708 --> 45:52.208
for the North Pole Field Network
Transit System.

45:59.250 --> 46:00.500
Car.

46:04.958 --> 46:06.082
I said practical.

46:06.083 --> 46:07.582
Like what, a minivan?

46:07.583 --> 46:09.124
Who wants a practical Hot Wheels?

46:09.125 --> 46:10.540
Also, what difference does it make?

46:10.541 --> 46:12.707
I gave you a directive.

46:12.708 --> 46:14.124
A directive?

46:14.125 --> 46:17.915
Is that what
you think is going on here?

46:17.916 --> 46:20.207
I'm telling you now,
you better listen to me

46:20.208 --> 46:22.250
because things are about to get real.

46:37.333 --> 46:39.582
- How did--
- I adjusted it to reality.

46:39.583 --> 46:41.415
- And does that--
- No, it doesn't work on everything.

46:41.416 --> 46:43.374
No, you can't try it. No, you can't drive.

46:43.375 --> 46:45.249
No more questions. Now, get in.

46:45.250 --> 46:46.750
And be careful with those robots.

47:05.291 --> 47:08.791
So you're like the bodyguard
for Santa Claus.

47:09.875 --> 47:11.499
I'm the commander of the E.L.F.

47:11.500 --> 47:12.957
What's that stand for?

47:12.958 --> 47:14.832
Enforcement, Logistics and Fortification.

47:14.833 --> 47:16.624
But as far as you're concerned,
it stands for

47:16.625 --> 47:19.416
Extremely Large and Formidable.

47:21.291 --> 47:23.000
Mm-hmm.

47:24.791 --> 47:28.666
And that's all you do all year, just...
protect Santa?

47:29.750 --> 47:32.250
- It's a big job.
- Sure. Sure.

47:35.083 --> 47:36.208
It's one day, though, right?

47:37.583 --> 47:39.165
Like, it's a big job for one day.

47:39.166 --> 47:43.415
We work 364 days a year
because on that one day

47:43.416 --> 47:47.124
we deliver presents
to several billion individual domiciles

47:47.125 --> 47:52.290
across 37 time zones without ever
being detected by a single human being.

47:52.291 --> 47:56.624
We prep, we rehearse every moment,
every stop down to the last chimney.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.999
So yeah, it's a lot of work.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.290
Three hundred and sixty-four days?

48:01.291 --> 48:02.416
We have Boxing Day off.

48:05.625 --> 48:07.582
Wouldn't it be easier if you broke it up?

48:07.583 --> 48:11.040
You know, like send different teams out
different places, just more efficient?

48:11.041 --> 48:12.457
No, it doesn't work like that.

48:12.458 --> 48:13.874
He's got to do it all himself?

48:13.875 --> 48:16.207
He doesn't have to. It's his purpose.

48:16.208 --> 48:17.790
He's a singular force in the universe.

48:17.791 --> 48:21.082
Okay, so worst-case scenario--
is there someone that can step in for him,

48:21.083 --> 48:22.665
like a vice Santa Claus?

48:22.666 --> 48:24.499
Are you listening to me? No.

48:24.500 --> 48:26.290
No one can do what he does.

48:26.291 --> 48:29.124
He knows when you're sleeping,
he knows when you're awake,

48:29.125 --> 48:32.415
and he knows that about
every single person on this planet.

48:32.416 --> 48:36.290
He has a list the size of Rhode Island,
and he checks it twice.

48:36.291 --> 48:38.124
If you were to try to read that list
just once,

48:38.125 --> 48:40.582
it would take you a decade,
but he does it twice.

48:40.583 --> 48:42.915
And the reason why
he's able to do any of it

48:42.916 --> 48:47.790
is because he is Santa Claus,
the one and only,

48:47.791 --> 48:50.750
and no one else can execute his mission.

48:51.833 --> 48:53.082
Which is?

48:53.083 --> 48:55.582
To spread cheer, asshole.

48:55.583 --> 48:57.500
Good feeling.

49:00.375 --> 49:01.750
Ready for a test.

49:02.833 --> 49:03.833
Bring me the weapon.

49:56.750 --> 49:58.207
Duplication complete.

49:58.208 --> 50:00.165
Good.

50:00.166 --> 50:02.499
Now let's see if it works.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.749
Who do you have in mind, Mum?

50:04.750 --> 50:07.875
We'll start with
the first name on the list.

50:28.250 --> 50:31.208
All right, now we're talking.

50:32.916 --> 50:35.415
Well, it was nice to meet you, Cal.

50:35.416 --> 50:36.957
Good luck with everything.

50:36.958 --> 50:38.249
Thank you so much.

50:38.250 --> 50:39.957
I'm just gonna live here now.

50:39.958 --> 50:41.957
- Gonna marry her.
- Why don't you focus?

50:41.958 --> 50:44.124
We got to find your guy.

50:44.125 --> 50:46.625
Not a lot of fun, are you, Cal?

50:48.500 --> 50:49.874
Oh, I'm fun.

50:49.875 --> 50:52.915
As a matter of fact, I won the prize
for most fun gift wrapper

50:52.916 --> 50:55.791
for 183 years in a row.

50:57.291 --> 50:58.500
Well, I take it back.

51:03.458 --> 51:04.915
Want me to show you how to do this?

51:04.916 --> 51:06.540
I would suggest
you give it a shot.

51:06.541 --> 51:09.332
I see the worst in everyone, Cal.

51:09.333 --> 51:10.915
It's my gift.

51:10.916 --> 51:12.415
And it's the key to my work.

51:12.416 --> 51:15.583
I can see a person's worst qualities
just by looking at 'em.

51:16.916 --> 51:18.582
See, look at this guy.

51:18.583 --> 51:20.332
He's married but not to her.

51:20.333 --> 51:22.665
That's why he has a tan line
where his wedding ring should be.

51:22.666 --> 51:25.665
This guy's about to screw over that guy.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.749
That's why he's laughing too loud.

51:27.750 --> 51:31.457
And this guy... now, he's interesting.

51:31.458 --> 51:32.832
Why, you ask?

51:32.833 --> 51:34.832
- I didn't ask.
- Well, I'll tell you.

51:34.833 --> 51:36.874
Shoes.

51:36.875 --> 51:37.999
Look around.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.832
Anyone else at the beach wearing shoes
besides you, me and him?

51:41.833 --> 51:43.583
And we're all working something.

51:50.916 --> 51:52.749
Ah.

51:52.750 --> 51:54.332
He's a Karmanian Death Merc.

51:54.333 --> 51:57.374
So is that guy and that guy.

51:57.375 --> 52:00.082
You can tell by the tattoos
on their hands.

52:00.083 --> 52:02.624
This is all fascinating. How about we find
the guy we're actually looking for?

52:02.625 --> 52:05.458
That's the guy we're looking for.

52:06.791 --> 52:08.707
The Karmanians are his security detail.

52:08.708 --> 52:10.540
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

52:10.541 --> 52:12.665
We'll have a few drinks, paint some nails.

52:12.666 --> 52:13.957
We'll see where the afternoon takes us.

52:13.958 --> 52:15.207
Hey, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:15.208 --> 52:16.999
- What are you doing?
- Going to talk to him.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.790
No. No. We got to go in sideways here.

52:19.791 --> 52:21.540
Remember when I said
they're called Death Mercs?

52:21.541 --> 52:23.333
We'll be fine.

52:33.166 --> 52:34.374
Keep walking.

52:34.375 --> 52:36.249
I need to talk to him now.

52:36.250 --> 52:37.832
Keep walking.

52:37.833 --> 52:39.415
I'm gonna count to five.

52:39.416 --> 52:41.832
Then what?

52:41.833 --> 52:43.666
- Then you're gonna get hurt.
- Oh.

52:48.375 --> 52:50.874
Listen, dickhead. It's Christmas.

52:50.875 --> 52:53.708
So in the yuletide spirit,
I'm gonna say it one more time.

53:17.750 --> 53:20.791
That was... so disturbing.

53:21.875 --> 53:24.374
- What's this?
- What the hell, Ted?

53:24.375 --> 53:25.832
Just give me a minute, sweetheart.

53:25.833 --> 53:29.124
I got to talk to these absolute morons
for a second,

53:29.125 --> 53:31.124
and then we'll go get some boba.

53:31.125 --> 53:32.999
Okay.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.665
- Where is he?
- Who?

53:34.666 --> 53:36.665
- You know who.
- You really want to do this?

53:36.666 --> 53:38.999
Uh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.540
And while I'm enjoying this visit from,
uh, the Magic Mike Christmas brigade,

53:44.541 --> 53:46.249
I got a couple ladies
waiting on boba teas.

53:46.250 --> 53:49.124
- Okay. Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait.
- I'm playing, big boy. Come on.

53:49.125 --> 53:52.582
Before you implode this man's skull
across this heavenly beach,

53:52.583 --> 53:55.374
- can I have a crack at it?
- Look, I'm telling you,

53:55.375 --> 53:59.915
for your own health and well-being,
I suggest you leave right now.

53:59.916 --> 54:01.915
You don't know who I know.

54:01.916 --> 54:04.540
All right. Well, you know what I know?

54:04.541 --> 54:06.540
I know you bought
some information yesterday

54:06.541 --> 54:09.082
and you paid quite a bit for it.

54:09.083 --> 54:11.125
Coordinates, the arctic.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.250
I know this 'cause I'm the one
who sold 'em to you.

54:16.708 --> 54:18.041
You...

54:20.666 --> 54:21.958
You're The Wolf?

54:23.041 --> 54:25.499
No. You should not be here.

54:25.500 --> 54:27.915
Do you know what you've done
by coming here?

54:27.916 --> 54:29.790
My client is not to be messed with.

54:29.791 --> 54:31.790
Who's the client? New York?

54:31.791 --> 54:33.624
Much worse.

54:33.625 --> 54:35.790
She'll kill us. She'll kill us all.

54:35.791 --> 54:39.499
- Who is it?
- I can't say her name.

54:39.500 --> 54:41.500
She will hear.

54:45.791 --> 54:49.541
Write her name in the sand.

54:57.125 --> 54:58.790
- "Gree-la"?
- You idiot.

54:58.791 --> 55:00.415
- "Gry-la"?
- No!

55:00.416 --> 55:02.500
"Gree-la"?

55:26.791 --> 55:29.416
Cal, Cal.

55:45.958 --> 55:47.832
Callum Drift,

55:47.833 --> 55:53.583
storied warrior of the North Pole.

55:54.791 --> 55:57.916
Gryla, the Christmas Witch.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.832
It has been many years.

56:00.833 --> 56:02.957
Not enough.

56:02.958 --> 56:04.332
Where is he?

56:04.333 --> 56:08.041
He's right here, fast asleep.

56:10.041 --> 56:11.500
Signal from Commander Drift.

56:13.333 --> 56:15.165
Gryla,
where are you?

56:15.166 --> 56:17.082
The Witch.

56:17.083 --> 56:20.457
I need him back unharmed immediately.

56:20.458 --> 56:23.415
It is not to be, warrior!

56:23.416 --> 56:25.040
I need M-WAT teams in motion

56:25.041 --> 56:27.707
- to every one of her ancestral haunts.
- Yes, Director.

56:27.708 --> 56:29.249
What is it you want?

56:29.250 --> 56:34.165
The same thing I have always wanted
for hundreds of years.

56:34.166 --> 56:37.040
To make them behave.

56:37.041 --> 56:39.207
The time has come...

56:39.208 --> 56:42.457
...to punish the naughty.

56:42.458 --> 56:44.124
All of them.

56:44.125 --> 56:46.915
Everyone who is on the list.

56:46.916 --> 56:49.540
Everyone who has ever been

56:49.541 --> 56:50.999
on the list.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.290
From killers to jaywalkers.

56:54.291 --> 56:57.415
Anyone who's ever lied or littered.

56:57.416 --> 57:00.665
Anyone who's ever been rude or late.

57:00.666 --> 57:04.082
You're talking about almost everyone.

57:04.083 --> 57:06.707
Everyone I see fit.

57:06.708 --> 57:09.582
Tomorrow they will all be punished.

57:09.583 --> 57:14.707
And he is going to help.

57:14.708 --> 57:16.790
You know he doesn't punish people.

57:16.791 --> 57:19.832
Step away, warrior.

57:19.833 --> 57:21.415
Let him go, Witch.

57:21.416 --> 57:22.791
I've warned you.

57:23.875 --> 57:25.249
And I've warned you.

57:25.250 --> 57:27.415
You can't see it yet,

57:27.416 --> 57:31.165
but when you wake up
this Christmas morning,

57:31.166 --> 57:35.291
the world will be much, much...

57:36.458 --> 57:38.125
...nicer.

57:42.916 --> 57:44.791
What in the actual fu--

57:46.458 --> 57:48.041
Get those teams moving now.

57:49.708 --> 57:51.707
What the hell was that?

57:51.708 --> 57:53.874
What was that? What the hell was that?

57:53.875 --> 57:55.540
- Where is she?
- We got to get out of here.

57:55.541 --> 57:56.624
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

57:56.625 --> 57:58.457
I'm just a middleman. I brokered the deal.

57:58.458 --> 58:01.666
- I'm telling you,
she does not mess around.
- Cal. Cal.

58:54.708 --> 58:56.125
Snowmen.

59:09.916 --> 59:10.957
No.

59:10.958 --> 59:13.332
Get him out of here. He's our only lead.
Don't let him get iced.

59:13.333 --> 59:14.708
All right.

59:18.166 --> 59:19.416
Come on.

59:23.875 --> 59:26.041
Go. Go.

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:08.916
Just got to rip off their carrots.

01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:12.458
I'll remember that next time it comes up.

01:02:14.083 --> 01:02:15.499
Want to give me a hand here?

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.916
You'll figure it out.

Tell Grandma I don't have time

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.165
She can take the bus.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.082
Goodbye.

What do you mean it's still there?

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.124
It's supposed to come back to me.

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.875
The machine isn't working. Fix it.

01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:25.041
Now, or else the next test

01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:28.083
Yes, Mum.

01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:32.500
Careful.

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:35.958
That's it.

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.749
She iced the broker.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.415
She really wanted to shut him up.

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:44.165
By the time he thaws out,
he'll be useless to us.

Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:48.957
My guys scanned all the surveillance
footage from the Pole last night.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.916
Look at this.

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:55.332
- That her?
- Sort of.

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:57.165
She's a shape-shifter.

01:03:57.166 --> 01:04:00.582
She's actually a 900-year-old ogre
with 13 sons who kill on command.

01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:02.207
Huh.

01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:05.207
Tracking shape-shifters
is a nightmare.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:08.249
She said that she was gonna
punish them all, every level.

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.290
I'd be more worried
about what she didn't say.

01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:12.290
She wasn't negotiating.

01:04:12.291 --> 01:04:13.957
It's a kidnapping with no demands.

01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:15.207
Doesn't usually end well.

01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:18.749
Unfortunately, our only lead
is now an ice cube.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.500
Not pointing any fingers.

01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:23.249
- Cal, not helpful.
- Yeah, Cal.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.708
Not helpful.

01:04:26.416 --> 01:04:28.166
So, what would you normally do?

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:32.582
I mean, normally,
I'd be running credit cards,

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:34.332
checking pings off cell phone towers,

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:36.957
trying to build a footprint--
her, her associates.

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:39.332
Never tracked a witch before.

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:40.749
Dated a few.

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:41.957
Right, Cal?

01:04:41.958 --> 01:04:44.291
I've dated several witches.
What's your point?

01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.124
Would she have any footprint
that I wouldn't know about

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:49.999
because I'm, like, a regular human being?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.250
Have you run a check on recent UDMs?

01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:56.625
- What's that?
- Unauthorized deployments of magic.

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:00.832
Lot of hits. Pretty typical stuff.

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:03.832
Couple of abjurations in Nairobi.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.332
Handful of divinations
in Santiago and New Orleans.

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:07.707
No, she's a conjurer.

01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:12.165
Got a pair of conjurations
eight days ago, few hours apart.

01:05:12.166 --> 01:05:15.165
Picked up the echo
off the resonator in Germany.

01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:16.250
The brother.

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.082
- Whose brother?
- Nick's.

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:21.333
- Santa's got a brother?
- Adopted, yes.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.540
She's working with the brother.

01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:24.874
We don't know that.

01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:26.665
No, but can you think
of a better place to hold Nick?

01:05:26.666 --> 01:05:28.999
Think about it.
It's under a concealment dome,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.915
and MORA has no jurisdiction
because of the treaty.

01:05:30.916 --> 01:05:33.374
He doesn't leave, and we don't visit.
That's the deal.

01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:35.457
We bust in and Nick's not there--

01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:36.707
MORA's not going. We're going.

01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:38.082
And he's never gonna know we're there.

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:40.375
- Cal--
- T minus 17 hours, Director.

01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:47.874
Keep me in the loop every step.

01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:50.457
In two hours, I brief the presidents
and prime ministers

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:53.374
and kings and queens of everywhere
so they can prepare.

01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:55.166
Prepare for what?

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.125
For the possibility of no Christmas.

01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:08.332
Hey. You don't have a Wonder Woman
action figure, do you?

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.207
That's not how it works. Come on.

01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:12.166
Ah, damn it.

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:17.041
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:35.250
I can't believe
they're out of essential oils!

01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:42.790
Hey.

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:45.624
Dylan asked you to go
to his concert tonight and you said no?

01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:47.999
What? No, that's not what happened.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.665
He actually said I shouldn't go.
He said it was gonna be lame.

01:06:50.666 --> 01:06:52.415
If he didn't want you to go,

01:06:52.416 --> 01:06:53.665
he wouldn't have brought it up.

01:06:53.666 --> 01:06:55.874
An actual parent
doesn't need an invitation.

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:58.290
They just go,
whether the kid likes it or not.

01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:01.249
That's what parents do.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.540
Well, we both know
that's not my strong suit, Olivia.

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:06.207
Look, if he wanted me to go,
he should've just asked me.

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.707
He's vulnerable, Jack.

01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:10.540
He's a kid, and he knows
you never show up.

01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:13.165
Olivia, I'm in... I'm at work.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.707
What am I supposed to do?

01:07:14.708 --> 01:07:16.457
I don't want to have to tell you
what to do, Jack.

01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:19.124
I want you to figure it out on your own,
because it's pretty easy.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:20.707
The concert starts at 7:00.

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:22.582
Well, I'm not gonna be home by 7:00.
Just tell Dylan that I--

01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:23.832
I'm not telling him anything.

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:26.083
If you want to tell him something,
do it yourself.

01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:31.249
What?

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:33.541
I didn't say anything.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.791
Dylan, right?

01:07:58.458 --> 01:07:59.875
Yeah.

01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:02.499
He's a good kid.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.875
Yeah, I know he's a good kid.

01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:17.207
It's not what you think.
His mother and I were never together.

01:08:17.208 --> 01:08:19.541
I mean, I'm his father,
but I've never been his dad.

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.374
She's a doctor now,
and she's married to a really good guy,

01:08:24.375 --> 01:08:28.415
and he is a good dad,
so the last thing the kid needs is, like,

01:08:28.416 --> 01:08:31.290
you know, some spare dad
who's a degenerate gambler

01:08:31.291 --> 01:08:34.416
hanging out with the scum of the earth,
who's got nothing to offer him, so...

01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:38.832
Honestly, the best thing I can do
for the kid is keep some distance

01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:42.124
so I don't get in the way
and he's not disappointed all the time.

01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:43.583
Uh-huh.

01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:46.290
"Uh-huh," what?

01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:50.166
I'm just saying,
if you're trying not to disappoint him...

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
...doesn't sound like it's working.

01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:23.624
Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking this, but...

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.375
what's the deal with Santa
and his brother?

01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:34.332
They used to work together...

01:09:34.333 --> 01:09:35.874
back in the beginning.

01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:38.915
Red gave gifts to well-behaved children,

01:09:38.916 --> 01:09:41.499
and the brother helped keep track
of who they were.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.582
Then the brother started making lists.

01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:47.290
And Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:50.833
He didn't like the idea of a running list
of misbehaved children.

01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:54.291
But the brother became obsessed.

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.707
So you're saying Santa's brother
started the Naughty List?

01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:01.832
Yes.

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:04.374
And he started to punish
the kids who were on it.

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:07.749
Red was furious.

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:12.624
So he took the list away,
and the brother never forgave him.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.624
He went out on his own,
eventually hooking up with the Witch,

01:10:15.625 --> 01:10:18.540
who was also in the punishment game,

01:10:18.541 --> 01:10:22.041
working Iceland
and several other Nordic territories.

01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:26.791
They were together for years,
but it ended badly.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:31.958
Santa's brother have a name,
or is it just "Santa's brother"?

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500
His name is Krampus.

01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:44.082
All right, listen to me. I don't know
what's waiting for us in here,

01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:45.499
but the brother, the Witch,

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.207
they're extremely dangerous,
and not in the ways that you're used to.

01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:50.040
If you see them, do not engage.

01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:51.790
So don't pick a fight with the Witch.

01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:52.874
Got it.

01:10:52.875 --> 01:10:55.415
If Nick is here, he's probably
being held in the dungeon.

01:10:55.416 --> 01:10:57.249
There's a door around back
that the guards use.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.040
We're gonna have to quietly sneak
through the courtyard,

01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:00.957
past the guillotines,
break in and head down.

01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:02.040
The guillotines?

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:05.082
Also, do not touch anything
under any circumstances.

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:07.749
There is much in here
that is not of the natural world.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.707
You're human, therefore weak.

01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:12.541
So, if you need to touch anything,
get me to do it.

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:16.999
Wait a minute. Are you not human?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.875
Do I look human?

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.582
Hey. So listen, man.

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:07.082
I think, if you don't need me here,
I might just go back to the car.

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.458
Shh.

01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:16.583
- Hellhounds.
- Hellhounds?

01:12:24.666 --> 01:12:25.666
Stand back.

01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:33.833
Ellen, distract them.

01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:14.415
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:15.874
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:18.124
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:20.124
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha...

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.249
What'd you do?

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:22.624
What do you mean what did I do?

01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:23.999
I didn't do anything.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.832
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:29.458
Thieves!

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:32.000
Holy shit.

01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:35.040
Whoa, whoa.

01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:36.290
Cal! Cal!

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:38.290
My name is Callum Drift,
commander of the E.L.F.

01:13:38.291 --> 01:13:39.915
- We are not thieves.
- Yeah, we're not thieves!

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.915
We're not thieves!

01:13:41.916 --> 01:13:44.083
Oh!

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.165
This was in his pocket.

01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:48.499
All right, I can explain that.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.125
I can explain that.

01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:58.957
I told you not to touch anything.

01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:00.582
It was an innocent mistake.

01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:04.082
You tried to steal a priceless piece
of gold from the Dark Lord of Winter.

01:14:04.083 --> 01:14:06.707
Not innocent and not a mistake.

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:09.582
Well, who leaves their gold just lying out
in an open treasure chest?

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:12.040
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:14.208
Guests come, they leave him gifts.
You stole from it.

01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:17.791
I shouldn't be surprised.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.499
Is that 'cause I happen to be on the list?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.749
You disappointed in me, too, Cal?

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:27.875
I have no expectations of you, Jack,
so I can't be disappointed.

01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:36.707
You know, I got problems of my own.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:39.624
I owe somebody a lot of money
that I don't have.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:42.749
I see this giant pile of gold
sitting there.

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:45.457
If you look at it a certain way,
what choice did I even have?

01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:48.582
You have every choice. It's all choices.

01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:50.707
You don't just happen
to be on the list, Jack.

01:14:50.708 --> 01:14:53.332
You put yourself there.

01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:55.374
You decide to steal gold.

01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:59.540
You decide to only look out for yourself
over everyone else on this Earth.

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:02.791
Every one of those kids
who are counting on us.

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:07.416
Counting on me to do my job.

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:19.208
Nick always says that every decision,
big or small, is an opportunity.

01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.499
To be nice?

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.707
To be good.

01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:26.125
Or not.

01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:32.082
I was one day away from retirement.

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:33.833
Then this happens.

01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:37.666
After 542 years.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.290
I resigned yesterday.

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.791
You did?

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.000
Why?

01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:50.500
I couldn't see it anymore.

01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:52.833
Couldn't see what?

01:15:57.083 --> 01:15:58.708
Doesn't matter.

01:16:11.916 --> 01:16:14.125
The third touch.

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:21.875
Is that him?

01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:32.875
What are they doing?

01:16:36.958 --> 01:16:39.166
They're playing Krampusschlap.

01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:42.749
Krampusschlap?

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.916
It's the official game of Krampusnacht.

01:16:57.458 --> 01:17:02.791
Ever undefeated, Dread Lord Krampus!

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:14.499
Callum Drift.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.000
Lord Krampus.

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:20.165
The festivities are just beginning,

01:17:20.166 --> 01:17:22.916
but I don't remember inviting you.

01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:31.165
You shouldn't be here.

01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:33.665
You know you shouldn't be here,

01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:36.374
and yet here you are.

01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:38.166
And with a mortal.

01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:41.290
Uh, I'm Jack O'Malley.

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:42.832
I didn't... I'm not...

01:17:42.833 --> 01:17:45.332
We didn't even... I mean, obviously we...

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.040
I just met him today.

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:49.166
The big one was armed with this.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.124
A Northern Vambrace.

01:17:52.125 --> 01:17:53.582
Thank you.

01:17:53.583 --> 01:17:57.124
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.332
Krampus, I can explain--

01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.749
You're trying to find him,

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:04.333
and you thought he would be here.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.583
Well, guess what, Northerner.

01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:12.708
He's not here.

01:18:14.916 --> 01:18:17.875
Last night, he was taken
from the compound by the Witch.

01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:21.208
And I know that she was here not long ago.

01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:25.665
Are you accusing me of something, Drift?

01:18:25.666 --> 01:18:28.707
You and she were partners once.

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:31.665
Roaming the countryside, the villages.

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:33.165
Punishing people.

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:34.916
Yes.

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:37.666
But back then, she was glorious.

01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:41.165
An ogre 18 feet high.

01:18:41.166 --> 01:18:43.332
The skin of an elephant.

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.625
Giant pair of tails.

01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:52.040
And yes, punishing as the cruelest winter.

01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:55.958
We had some wonderful times together.

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.707
But I gave up that work, remember?

01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:04.999
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.040
trying to scare them into decency.

01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:10.000
I did my part!

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.583
The only punishing I do now...

01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:18.332
...is for fun.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.249
Like my good friend over here...

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:24.499
...enjoying his headache on Krampusnacht.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.290
But today is not Krampusnacht.

01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:29.332
In this house, Northerner,

01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:33.624
it is always Krampusnacht!

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:35.582
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:38.207
Ah, ah, ah! Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:40.082
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

01:19:40.083 --> 01:19:43.499
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.832
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah! Ooh, ah, ooh, ah!

01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:48.166
- Krampus!
- Ah, ah, ah! Ooh--

01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:50.500
Why was she here?

01:19:53.583 --> 01:19:56.874
Many years ago, she gave me a gift.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.165
She came because she wanted it back.

01:19:59.166 --> 01:20:01.540
A gift? What gift?

01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:03.790
The Glaskäfig.

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:07.457
On its face, a simple glass snow globe,

01:20:07.458 --> 01:20:11.165
but its true purpose is nefarious.

01:20:11.166 --> 01:20:12.999
Tremendously punishing.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.040
She wants to punish them all.

01:20:16.041 --> 01:20:19.749
The Glaskäfig is solitude.

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.125
A prison for but one.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.791
Krampus, I need to find him.

01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.750
Let me go.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:36.082
And why...

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:38.166
would I do that?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.833
Because we need him.

01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.541
Now more than ever, we need him.

01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.041
And you know that.

01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:53.166
Let me go.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.124
Northerner.

01:21:05.125 --> 01:21:07.500
You are not going anywhere.

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.540
You, get out.

01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:14.207
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:17.582
There is a price for this intrusion.

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:20.874
Now and forever,

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:23.208
Drift belongs to me.

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:28.707
So I can...

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:30.500
just walk out of here?

01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:32.833
I suggest you run.

01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.958
You'll learn to love it here.

01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.708
Take him away.

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:47.415
Wait. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, sorry. Wait.

01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:49.040
Um, uh, L-Lord... uh, Mister...

01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:51.957
Lord Krampus, um...

01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:53.541
you and I aren't so different.

01:21:58.125 --> 01:22:00.999
We're pretty different, but I think
we have some things in common.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.415
Ah. Do you, now?

01:22:03.416 --> 01:22:04.707
Yeah.

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:07.582
I mean, you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.874
Bit of a gambler?

01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:10.374
Well, so am I.

01:22:10.375 --> 01:22:14.832
Now, when we came in here, my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:17.832
at your game, uh, Krampusschlap.

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.832
What?

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.999
Now, initially, I said, "No way."

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.832
But the more I see him getting riled up,
I'm starting to like my odds,

01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:28.540
so just hear me out.

01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:31.624
If you win, we go to your dungeon forever.

01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:34.708
If he wins, we walk.

01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.749
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.582
I mean, I get that. He's a big guy.

01:22:39.583 --> 01:22:41.249
No shame.

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.625
Lot of people watching.

01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:50.582
Imbeciles.

01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:52.749
I love it.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:54.457
- Oh.
- Ooh, ooh, ah, ah!

01:22:54.458 --> 01:22:56.500
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah! Ah, ah, ah!

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:08.708
Smack the shit out of that goat.

01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:20.290
The rules are as follows:

01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:23.707
The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:27.500
The first to be knocked out or die loses.

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.540
First touch.

01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:36.250
That's you.

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:50.499
You know, I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.540
Come on.

01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:54.416
I'm sure you do.

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.915
He's still your brother.

01:23:57.916 --> 01:23:59.625
And he never gave up on you.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.040
What would you know about it?

01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:03.958
I know him.

01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:09.625
Take your best "schlap."

01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:27.000
Interesting.

01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:29.500
My turn.

01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.582
I could be merciful

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:41.290
and kill him on the first touch.

01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:44.500
But what fun would that be, huh?

01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.250
Oh, my God.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.749
Hey, buddy. You okay?

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.749
He just slapped the shit out of me.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:17.124
Yeah, that was so embarrassing.

01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:20.165
I love this game!

01:25:20.166 --> 01:25:22.290
I can't... I can't beat him.
He's a winter demigod. I--

01:25:22.291 --> 01:25:23.874
Just get up. Trust me.

01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:25.875
I can't...

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.250
Second touch.

01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:38.125
Oh. Sorry.

01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.541
Let me make it easier for you.

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.833
Come on.

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.708
Come on.

01:25:58.583 --> 01:25:59.875
Come on.

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.500
Cover us.

01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:07.458
Ellen, come on!

01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:28.500
I thought I had some shady friends.

01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:32.457
I can't believe that worked.

01:27:32.458 --> 01:27:34.832
Yeah, sorry about that.
It's all I could come up with.

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:36.415
No, it was great.

01:27:36.416 --> 01:27:38.125
Oh.

01:27:39.416 --> 01:27:40.833
I misjudged you.

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.749
Not what you'd expect
from a Class Four Naughty Lister, right?

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.040
Well, it's Level Four.

01:27:47.041 --> 01:27:48.749
- Ah.
- But that's what I'm saying.

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.208
You could've left, but you didn't.

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.166
Thank you.

01:27:55.458 --> 01:27:57.790
All right.

01:27:57.791 --> 01:27:59.666
Should we go find your guy?

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:02.833
Let's save Christmas.

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:06.207
Right.

01:28:06.208 --> 01:28:07.249
Say it.

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.207
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Say it.

01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:10.624
- I don't want to.
- Let's save Christmas.

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:11.874
I'm not gonna say that.

01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:15.707
I'm gonna need you to say,
"Let's save Christmas."

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:18.124
All right. God. Okay.

01:28:18.125 --> 01:28:19.915
Let's save Christmas.

01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:21.874
That was terrible.

01:28:21.875 --> 01:28:23.124
Okay.

01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:25.458
All right, all right.

01:28:27.666 --> 01:28:29.457
Let's save Christmas.

01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:31.332
- There it is.
- All right.

01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:34.040
All right, so the, uh, snow globe,
what's the deal with that?

01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:35.290
The "glossy pig"?

01:28:35.291 --> 01:28:37.957
Glaskäfig. It's German for "glass cage."

01:28:37.958 --> 01:28:39.249
Well, what do you think
Gryla's trying to do?

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:41.207
- Is there--
- Shh.

01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:43.208
...Gryla's trying...?

01:28:45.333 --> 01:28:47.041
We got to go.

01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:50.665
Mum.

01:28:50.666 --> 01:28:53.707
Ready for another test.

01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:54.999
Good.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.457
The next name on the list?

01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:59.915
No.

01:28:59.916 --> 01:29:02.333
I have a better idea.

01:29:04.541 --> 01:29:06.540
She said she wanted to punish them all.

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:08.582
It seems like the Glaskäfig
was just for one person.

01:29:08.583 --> 01:29:13.082
Is it possible she can make more of 'em
with, like, witch magic or--

01:29:13.083 --> 01:29:14.915
She would need billions of them.

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:17.458
She's immensely powerful,
but that's a big lift for a conjurer.

01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:19.624
Okay.

01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:22.499
I mean, honestly, the only place that has
that kind of manufacturing capacity--

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.875
Look out!

01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:50.750
This something that happens to you a lot?

01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:55.374
Unexplained player piano
in the middle of a German highway.

01:29:55.375 --> 01:29:57.833
No. This is rare.

01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:05.957
It's for you.

01:30:05.958 --> 01:30:08.499
Well, I'm not touching that thing.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.082
Just get back in the truck. We'll drive
right around the haunted piano.

01:30:11.083 --> 01:30:13.665
We have to open it.

01:30:13.666 --> 01:30:16.374
This... this is how it starts.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:18.416
You're doing it.

01:30:27.708 --> 01:30:31.166
Oh, see?

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.999
Dylan.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.249
Did you send me this stupid present
instead of coming to this thing?

01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.957
Wait, what?

01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:43.999
Because if you don't want to come,
I don't care.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.082
I wanted to be there. I really did.

01:30:46.083 --> 01:30:48.207
- Then something--
- Just stop, okay?

01:30:48.208 --> 01:30:51.457
You don't have to pretend
because my mom is guilt-tripping you.

01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:52.874
I'm not pretending.

01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:55.165
- I really want to find a way--
- You never come to anything.

01:30:55.166 --> 01:30:56.957
Yeah, I... I know.

01:30:56.958 --> 01:30:58.290
- I know.
- Whatever.

01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:01.665
I got to go. Just don't send me
any more stupid gifts, okay?

01:31:01.666 --> 01:31:04.165
W-Wait, wait.
Dylan, what'd you mean by that?

01:31:04.166 --> 01:31:05.333
This thing.

01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:09.290
- Dylan, don't touch that. Wait.
- No, don't.

01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:11.165
Do you seriously think
that there's anything--

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:12.832
Dylan, listen to me. Put that down.

01:31:12.833 --> 01:31:14.749
Because I'm here to tell you that--

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:16.165
What is this?

01:31:16.166 --> 01:31:17.458
What's going on?

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:22.957
What's happening?

01:31:22.958 --> 01:31:25.125
Put that down!

01:31:26.541 --> 01:31:28.582
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:29.875
I don't know.

01:31:34.333 --> 01:31:36.166
Jack.

01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:39.708
It's my kid.

01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.708
Find me.

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:56.999
Dad?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.082
- Dad! What's going on?
- Dylan.

01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:00.375
Where are we?

01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:04.625
Oh, my God.

01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:07.750
Oh, my God.

01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.041
It worked.

01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:19.207
Mm. Jack O'Malley.

01:32:19.208 --> 01:32:21.290
Level Four.

01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:24.582
What a perfect way to start my collection.

01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:27.416
Bring production online.

01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:52.415
Tonight, I will deliver one of these
to every single deviant on the list.

01:32:52.416 --> 01:32:55.499
And when they wake up and open their gift,

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.582
they'll join my collection,

01:32:57.583 --> 01:33:01.582
and the world will be
in the hands of the righteous.

01:33:01.583 --> 01:33:02.833
Finally.

01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:07.083
Tonight, I make the ride.

01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:11.457
Director, we have Drift.

01:33:11.458 --> 01:33:12.790
What happened?

01:33:12.791 --> 01:33:14.415
What do you know about the Glaskäfig?

01:33:14.416 --> 01:33:16.790
Mythical magic snow globe
used to imprison the naughty.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.290
Krampus has it. Why?

01:33:18.291 --> 01:33:20.290
Not anymore. The Witch has it.

01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:21.874
And I think she's trying
to punish everyone on the list.

01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:22.957
Wait. Slow down.

01:33:22.958 --> 01:33:24.374
O'Malley just got globed

01:33:24.375 --> 01:33:26.249
- and disappeared.
- What?

01:33:26.250 --> 01:33:27.457
His kid, too.

01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:29.249
Oh, dear Lord.

01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:31.416
- Run O'Malley's tag.
- Yes, Director.

01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:36.207
Zoe, I think she's trying
to mass-produce the Glaskäfig.

01:33:36.208 --> 01:33:37.999
- How could she possibly do that?
- Think about it.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.707
What's the one place that's capable
of something like that?

01:33:40.708 --> 01:33:42.082
The North Pole?

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.207
But Nick's not there.
The complex runs on his power.

01:33:44.208 --> 01:33:46.249
That can't be it.

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:48.582
- Unless--
- Unless he never left.

01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:52.625
- But the snowcat, the jet.
- Drones, diversions.

01:33:54.458 --> 01:33:55.874
Nick is still there.

01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:59.583
Director, I am not picking up
a signal for O'Malley's tracker.

01:34:01.625 --> 01:34:03.624
Because he's under the dome.

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:05.874
But I've been talking
to your team all night.

01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:07.791
You have?

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.915
Try Partridge.

01:34:12.916 --> 01:34:15.166
- Connect to Partridge.
- Yes, Director.

01:34:17.208 --> 01:34:19.999
- Hi. Cal.
- Hey. How you holding up, MC?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.457
Well, I can't sleep.

01:34:21.458 --> 01:34:25.040
I'm just keeping myself busy
baking cookies for him.

01:34:25.041 --> 01:34:26.457
For when he comes home.

01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:27.999
Well, he's gonna love that.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.290
What do you got baking?

01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:33.291
Just pulled out
a fresh batch of macaroons.

01:34:35.916 --> 01:34:37.333
He'll love that.

01:34:38.416 --> 01:34:40.582
Hang in. I'll keep you posted.

01:34:40.583 --> 01:34:42.500
Thanks.

01:34:44.083 --> 01:34:45.374
That's not her.

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:46.665
What do you mean?

01:34:46.666 --> 01:34:48.208
Nick hates macaroons.

01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:51.457
They're shape-shifters.

01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:52.957
The Witch, the Lads.

01:34:52.958 --> 01:34:54.666
They're all shape-shifters.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.500
The North Pole has been taken.

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:07.082
They're onto us.

01:35:07.083 --> 01:35:08.707
Where are we?

01:35:08.708 --> 01:35:11.665
- What's happening?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now, listen.

01:35:11.666 --> 01:35:15.207
Now, I know
what this is gonna sound like.

01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:17.708
Basically...

01:35:19.916 --> 01:35:25.374
...Santa is missing,
and that giant lady is a witch,

01:35:25.375 --> 01:35:30.249
and she got the snow globes
from a giant demonic Christmas...

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:31.749
goat man.

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:33.707
And now they're gonna make
millions of them

01:35:33.708 --> 01:35:37.165
with that magical photocopier thing.

01:35:37.166 --> 01:35:39.290
Look, I don't have
all the technical details,

01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:44.665
but basically, these globes are meant
to imprison the naughty people forever.

01:35:44.666 --> 01:35:46.875
Forever?

01:35:47.958 --> 01:35:49.958
Not forever. I didn't...
Scratch that last part.

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:58.875
Remember, can't trust anyone.

01:36:00.208 --> 01:36:02.082
I've got a signal.

01:36:02.083 --> 01:36:04.041
O'Malley is here somewhere.

01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:09.875
- We're close.
- Hey, chief.

01:36:11.375 --> 01:36:12.958
Fred?

01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:17.166
- I'll let the team know that you're back.
- How about you don't?

01:36:22.083 --> 01:36:23.500
Shape-shifters.

01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:26.166
Good tidings.

01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:34.041
It says he should be right here.

01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:39.416
The old tunnel system.

01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.041
Runs right beneath the original workshop.

01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:44.125
Let's go.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.582
Is this happening because I was ditching?

01:36:47.583 --> 01:36:48.707
What?

01:36:48.708 --> 01:36:50.040
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

01:36:50.041 --> 01:36:52.207
No, no, no, no, no, no, Dylan.

01:36:52.208 --> 01:36:53.624
You said it was for naughty people,
didn't you?

01:36:53.625 --> 01:36:55.082
Well, she said that, but--

01:36:55.083 --> 01:36:56.790
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

01:36:56.791 --> 01:36:58.291
Look at me.

01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:02.582
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:05.708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.999
You're only in here be...

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.916
because of me.

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:14.707
What did you do?

01:37:14.708 --> 01:37:17.207
Mm. Lot of stuff.

01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:19.625
It's... long list.

01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:23.957
But bigger than any of that,
it's what I didn't do.

01:37:23.958 --> 01:37:25.875
What are you talking about?

01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:34.208
I've been a terrible father.

01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:38.874
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. It is.

01:37:38.875 --> 01:37:40.582
I haven't been around.

01:37:40.583 --> 01:37:43.624
I told myself I was doing you a favor,
which is bullshit.

01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:47.166
It was bad for you,
and it was terrible for me.

01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:51.332
I've made some mistakes, pal. I know that.

01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:53.750
But I also know that I can do better.

01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:56.957
And I know that's easier said than done.

01:37:56.958 --> 01:38:00.625
I know it's a lot of work,
and I hope it's not too late.

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:08.791
Every day,
every decision is an opportunity.

01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:13.500
And I want to start taking some of those.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.957
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

01:38:16.958 --> 01:38:20.625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:24.540
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world,

01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:27.290
but I know I can do better,

01:38:27.291 --> 01:38:30.832
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

01:38:30.833 --> 01:38:33.125
I will never stop trying.

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.208
What just happened?

01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:07.000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:10.540
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

01:39:10.541 --> 01:39:13.333
First, we got to find somebody. Come on.

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:23.332
Ow.

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:25.291
Cal.

01:39:26.833 --> 01:39:30.000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now, what would it be?

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:32.749
Wonder Woman.

01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:33.999
It's him.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.249
You all right?

01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:37.374
Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:37.375 --> 01:39:38.915
It's good to see you.

01:39:38.916 --> 01:39:40.916
Dad?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.290
Buddy, come here.

01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:44.790
I want you to meet some friends.

01:39:44.791 --> 01:39:47.957
Cal, Zoe, this is my son Dylan.

01:39:47.958 --> 01:39:49.832
The one and only Dylan.

01:39:49.833 --> 01:39:51.250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:54.915
Welcome to the North Pole.

01:39:54.916 --> 01:39:57.249
Huh?

01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:59.999
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.832
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

01:40:01.833 --> 01:40:04.249
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds,

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:06.249
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:07.415
Cal, we saw her.

01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:09.499
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.374
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

01:40:11.375 --> 01:40:12.540
to everybody on the list.

01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:15.290
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

01:40:15.291 --> 01:40:16.540
Without him.

01:40:16.541 --> 01:40:18.125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.750
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.

01:40:23.416 --> 01:40:24.500
Wait.

01:40:32.416 --> 01:40:33.499
Chief.

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:34.832
Garcia.

01:40:34.833 --> 01:40:36.125
Cal.

01:40:39.208 --> 01:40:40.750
Ma'am.

01:40:41.833 --> 01:40:43.500
Where is he?

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.333
Gryla, stop!

01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:26.291
I was just leaving.

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:29.791
- Go. Take him.
- Come with me, Dylan. Got him.

01:41:46.708 --> 01:41:48.540
Come on!

01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:49.625
Go!

01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:16.333
Hyah!

01:44:19.166 --> 01:44:20.665
Nick.

01:44:20.666 --> 01:44:22.750
Come on, Red. I got you.

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.540
Red?

01:44:34.541 --> 01:44:37.207
Come back to me. Come back to me, boss.

01:44:37.208 --> 01:44:38.833
Wake up.

01:44:41.791 --> 01:44:43.790
Nick? Nick!

01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:45.708
It's Cal.

01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:58.916
Cal!

01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:12.500
Holy shit.

01:45:14.625 --> 01:45:15.625
Jack.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.625
Run.

01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:23.707
No way, man.

01:45:23.708 --> 01:45:26.082
For a guy like me,
there's worse ways to go out

01:45:26.083 --> 01:45:28.000
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:32.458
Gryla!

01:45:33.541 --> 01:45:34.750
It's time for you to go.

01:45:36.208 --> 01:45:38.832
Oh, I'll go,

01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:42.124
but I'm taking him with me.

01:45:42.125 --> 01:45:44.957
You're not taking him anywhere.

01:45:44.958 --> 01:45:48.624
His power has been wasted
for far too long.

01:45:48.625 --> 01:45:51.833
The punishing begins tonight.

01:45:52.916 --> 01:45:55.499
You're gonna have to go through me first.

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.332
With pleasure.

01:45:57.333 --> 01:45:59.665
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

01:45:59.666 --> 01:46:01.749
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:03.415
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

01:46:03.416 --> 01:46:05.457
Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

01:46:05.458 --> 01:46:08.791
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh, cha, cha.

01:46:17.958 --> 01:46:22.999
You imbeciles have no idea
how to talk to a woman like this.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.041
A real woman.

01:46:27.166 --> 01:46:28.750
She's my ex.

01:46:30.666 --> 01:46:32.832
Hello.

01:46:32.833 --> 01:46:33.999
My love.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.665
Get out of here, Krampus.

01:46:35.666 --> 01:46:38.832
I can't do that.

01:46:38.833 --> 01:46:43.665
And lovely as it is
to see your miserable face,

01:46:43.666 --> 01:46:48.416
my brother has somewhere to be.

01:46:57.458 --> 01:46:59.416
Just like old times.

01:47:31.166 --> 01:47:33.791
Haven't you had enough?

01:47:35.375 --> 01:47:37.999
If you want to take him,

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.333
you're gonna have to kill me.

01:47:41.416 --> 01:47:43.415
Gladly.

01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:45.540
Your sacrifice will mean nothing.

01:47:45.541 --> 01:47:47.375
Gryla!

01:47:49.708 --> 01:47:52.208
Enough!

01:47:53.458 --> 01:47:57.040
Any last words
for your most faithful warrior?

01:47:57.041 --> 01:47:59.208
Only one.

01:48:00.666 --> 01:48:03.125
Kavalame!

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:11.333
Merry Christmas, Witch.

01:48:25.625 --> 01:48:27.250
No!

01:48:36.458 --> 01:48:37.958
No.

01:48:41.708 --> 01:48:43.415
- No!
- Well, look at you.

01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:45.500
Oh, shut up!

01:48:48.666 --> 01:48:49.916
Nick.

01:48:51.333 --> 01:48:52.416
You okay?

01:48:54.375 --> 01:48:55.708
Yeah.

01:48:59.625 --> 01:49:01.250
What took you so long?

01:49:19.583 --> 01:49:22.790
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

01:49:22.791 --> 01:49:25.958
Let's not get mushy.

01:49:27.041 --> 01:49:28.291
Thank you, brother.

01:49:31.416 --> 01:49:34.374
Merry Christmas...

01:49:34.375 --> 01:49:36.250
brother.

01:49:37.916 --> 01:49:39.708
You want to maybe stick around a while?

01:49:42.958 --> 01:49:44.708
Don't push it.

01:49:47.291 --> 01:49:48.500
Get to work.

01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:52.124
And you...

01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:53.958
I want a rematch.

01:50:00.666 --> 01:50:03.000
Happy Krampusnacht!

01:50:09.666 --> 01:50:11.332
Oh, my God.

01:50:11.333 --> 01:50:12.707
Honey, where are you?

01:50:12.708 --> 01:50:14.833
Mom,
you're not gonna believe this.

01:50:16.916 --> 01:50:18.540
T plus
six minutes.

01:50:18.541 --> 01:50:19.957
Sky Train, this is Partridge.

01:50:19.958 --> 01:50:21.540
Back in the chair and back on track.

01:50:21.541 --> 01:50:23.291
Good to
have you back, ma'am.

01:50:29.708 --> 01:50:31.707
We are currently
six minutes behind schedule,

01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:34.250
so we're gonna run this preflight
like our hair's on fire.

01:50:50.166 --> 01:50:51.707
Dylan.

01:50:51.708 --> 01:50:52.999
Jack.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.749
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:50:54.750 --> 01:50:56.041
Thanks for your help today.

01:50:57.125 --> 01:50:59.124
He helped, too.

01:50:59.125 --> 01:51:00.958
I know.

01:51:04.583 --> 01:51:08.208
All systems
are go. Thirty seconds to launch.

01:51:10.291 --> 01:51:11.791
Hey, Drift.

01:51:13.375 --> 01:51:15.625
Have a great ride.

01:51:16.708 --> 01:51:18.708
Merry Christmas, Director.

01:51:20.083 --> 01:51:21.875
Dylan. Jack.

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:24.875
You guys coming?

01:51:26.583 --> 01:51:28.165
- What?
- Really?

01:51:28.166 --> 01:51:30.083
Come on, let's go. We got to roll.

01:51:31.958 --> 01:51:34.875
Red One, you are clear for takeoff.

01:53:03.416 --> 01:53:04.707
Copy that.

01:53:04.708 --> 01:53:06.125
We're coming at you.

01:53:44.166 --> 01:53:46.458
Yes! Yes!

01:53:57.375 --> 01:53:58.999
He really does it, doesn't he?

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.749
Goes everywhere
in the entire world in one night.

01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:05.165
He's a lot cooler than I thought he was.

01:54:05.166 --> 01:54:07.582
- And a lot more athletic.
- Yeah.

01:54:07.583 --> 01:54:09.625
- Guy's a beast.
- The guy is a beast.

01:54:38.666 --> 01:54:40.666
You're seeing it, aren't you?

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:43.500
Yeah, I knew you'd get it back.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.707
I lost it there for a while, Nick.

01:54:46.708 --> 01:54:48.833
It's easy to lose it, Cal.

01:54:50.208 --> 01:54:52.000
Important thing is to keep trying.

01:54:57.916 --> 01:54:59.374
Nick.

01:54:59.375 --> 01:55:01.291
I'd like to stay on.

01:55:02.458 --> 01:55:03.791
If you'll have me.

01:55:07.791 --> 01:55:09.541
You got it, Commander.

01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:17.666
Did we just save Christmas?

01:55:19.291 --> 01:55:21.583
I think we just saved Christmas.
