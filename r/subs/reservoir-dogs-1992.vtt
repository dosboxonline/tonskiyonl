00:19.190 --> 00:21.586
<i>So let me tell you what
Like a Virgin is about.</i>

00:21.626 --> 00:24.425
<i>It's all about a girl who
digs a guy with a big dick.</i>

00:24.506 --> 00:27.105
<i>The entire song - it's a
metaphor for big dicks.</i>

00:27.186 --> 00:31.025
No, it ain't. It's about a
girl who's very vulnerable.

00:31.715 --> 00:35.105
She's been fucked over a few times, then
she meets a guy who's very sensitive...

00:35.186 --> 00:38.613
Whoa. Time out, Greenbay. Tell that
fuckin' bullshit to the tourists.

00:38.651 --> 00:40.793
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

00:40.842 --> 00:45.006
Like A Virgin's not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

00:45.537 --> 00:48.305
That's what True Blue's about.
Granted, no argument about that.

00:48.386 --> 00:49.585
Which one's True Blue?

00:49.666 --> 00:52.248
You ain't heard True Blue? It
was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

00:52.295 --> 00:55.865
I don't even follow that Tops of the Pop
shit and even I've heard of True Blue.

00:55.935 --> 00:58.779
I didn't say I hadn't heard of it.
What I asked is how's it go.

00:58.802 --> 01:01.199
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.225
Personally, I can
do without her.

01:03.352 --> 01:05.631
I used to like her early stuff.
Borderline.

01:05.706 --> 01:08.690
But when she got off with that Papa
Don't Preach phase, I tuned out.

01:08.768 --> 01:11.623
But you guys are like making me
lose my train of thought here.

01:11.661 --> 01:13.500
I was saying something.
What was it?

01:13.786 --> 01:18.583
Oh, Toby's that little Chinese girl.
What was her last name?

01:18.622 --> 01:20.141
What's that?

01:20.255 --> 01:24.785
It's an old address book I found in a
coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

01:24.866 --> 01:27.625
- What was that name?
- Look, what the fuck was I talking about?

01:27.706 --> 01:30.585
You said True Blue
was about a guy...

01:30.666 --> 01:34.276
A sensitive girl who meets a nice guy, but
Like a Virgin was a metaphor for big dicks.

01:34.338 --> 01:37.345
Okay, let me tell you what
Like A Virgin's about.

01:37.426 --> 01:40.182
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.573
I'm talking morning,
day, night, afternoon.

01:42.620 --> 01:45.585
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.877
- How many dicks is that?
- A lot.

01:47.878 --> 01:52.345
So, one day she meets this John Holmes
motherfucker and it's like, whoa, baby!

01:52.426 --> 01:56.665
I mean, this cat is like Charles Bronson
In The Great Escape. He's digging tunnels.

01:56.746 --> 02:01.185
She's getting serious dick action, and she's
feeling something she ain't felt since forever.

02:01.306 --> 02:03.265
Pain. Pain.

02:03.386 --> 02:04.861
Chew? Toby Chew?

02:04.862 --> 02:07.925
It hurts. It hurts her.
It shouldn't hurt her.

02:07.945 --> 02:09.598
You know, her pussy should be
Bubble Yum by now,

02:09.661 --> 02:15.665
but when this cat fucks her, it hurts.
It hurts just like it did the first time.

02:15.746 --> 02:18.253
You see the pain is
reminding a fuck machine

02:18.300 --> 02:20.505
what it was once
like to be a virgin,

02:20.586 --> 02:23.465
hence... Like a Virgin.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.759
Wong!

02:26.146 --> 02:28.025
Give me that fuckin' thing.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.465
What the hell do you think you are doing?
Give me my book back.

02:30.586 --> 02:33.465
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

02:33.586 --> 02:36.065
What do you mean when we leave?
Give me it back now!

02:36.146 --> 02:40.185
For the past 15 minutes now, you've
been droning on about names.

02:40.266 --> 02:41.505
"Toby..."

02:41.626 --> 02:44.120
"Toby? Toby?"

02:44.167 --> 02:45.366
"Toby Wong."

02:45.431 --> 02:47.550
"Toby Wong? Toby Wong."

02:47.604 --> 02:50.612
"Toby Chung? Fucking
Charlie Chan!"

02:50.696 --> 02:53.215
I got Madonna's big dick
coming out of my left ear,

02:53.241 --> 02:56.840
and Toby the Jap I-don't-know-what
coming out of my right.

02:57.266 --> 02:59.105
Gimme that book.

03:00.231 --> 03:01.705
Are you gonna put it away?

03:01.786 --> 03:04.185
I'm gonna do whatever the
fuck I want with it.

03:05.403 --> 03:07.705
Well, then I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to keep it.

03:07.826 --> 03:10.985
Hey, Joe... want me
to shoot this guy?

03:11.066 --> 03:15.785
Shit! You shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologise.

03:19.906 --> 03:23.003
You guys been listening to K-Billy's
Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend?

03:23.004 --> 03:26.301
- Oh, yeah, man, it's fuckin' great.
- Can you believe the songs they've been playing?

03:26.351 --> 03:27.791
You know what I heard the other day?

03:27.981 --> 03:30.981
Heartbeat, it's A Lovebeat, by Little
Tony DeFranco and DeFranco Family.

03:31.066 --> 03:33.529
I haven't heard that song since I was
in the fifth fuckin' grade.

03:33.591 --> 03:37.049
When I was coming down here, The Night
The Lights Went Out In Georgia came on.

03:37.346 --> 03:39.905
I... I ain't heard that
song since it was big.

03:40.026 --> 03:43.423
When it was big, I must have heard
it a million trillion fuckin' times.

03:43.494 --> 03:48.265
This is the first time I ever realised that the
girl singing the song is the one who shot Andy.

03:48.346 --> 03:50.900
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

03:51.001 --> 03:52.969
I thought the cheating
wife shot Andy.

03:53.023 --> 03:55.101
Yeah, but they say at
the end of the song.

03:55.133 --> 03:57.023
I know, motherfucker.
I just heard it.

03:57.072 --> 03:58.578
That's what I'm talking about.

04:00.826 --> 04:03.476
I must have zoned out
during that part before.

04:03.506 --> 04:06.877
All right. I'll take
care of the check.

04:06.878 --> 04:08.917
You guys can get the tip.

04:09.390 --> 04:11.723
It should be about
a buck apiece.

04:11.724 --> 04:14.523
And, you, when I come
back, I want my book.

04:15.127 --> 04:17.326
Sorry, it's my book now.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.491
Hey, I changed my mind.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.611
Shoot this piece
of shit, will you?

04:25.906 --> 04:28.865
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

04:35.410 --> 04:36.910
Come on, throw in a buck.

04:37.222 --> 04:38.625
Uh-uh. I don't tip.

04:38.746 --> 04:39.985
You don't tip?

04:40.066 --> 04:41.345
No, I don't believe in it.

04:41.988 --> 04:44.187
You don't believe in tipping?

04:44.371 --> 04:47.316
You know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.072
Don't give me that. She don't
make enough, she can quit.

04:50.878 --> 04:53.545
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

04:53.923 --> 04:56.613
Let me just get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

04:56.614 --> 04:59.105
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

04:59.106 --> 05:01.160
All right, I mean I'll tip if somebody
really deserves a tip.

05:01.226 --> 05:03.481
If they really put forth the
effort, I'll give 'em something extra,

05:03.543 --> 05:06.305
but I mean this tipping automatically
is for the birds.

05:07.529 --> 05:09.566
As far as I'm concerned,
they're doing their job.

05:09.590 --> 05:11.972
- Hey, this girl was nice.
- She was okay.

05:12.026 --> 05:14.345
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

05:14.426 --> 05:16.305
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

05:19.826 --> 05:23.745
- I'd go over 12 percent for that.
- Look, I ordered coffee.

05:23.826 --> 05:26.545
We've been here a long fuckin' time.
She's only filled my cup three times.

05:26.666 --> 05:29.225
When I order coffee, I
want it filled six times.

05:29.346 --> 05:31.974
Six times? What if she's
too fuckin' busy?

05:32.021 --> 05:34.940
Words "Too fuckin' busy" shouldn't
be in a waitress's vocabulary.

05:35.107 --> 05:39.186
Excuse me, Mr. Pink, but the last fuckin'
thing you need is another cup of coffee.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.818
Jesus Christ, I mean these ladies
aren't starving to death.

05:42.094 --> 05:43.812
They make minimum wage.

05:43.813 --> 05:46.054
You know, I used to work
minimum wage and when I did

05:46.106 --> 05:48.945
I wasn't lucky enough to have
a job society deemed tip-worthy.

05:49.026 --> 05:51.266
But you don't care they're counting
on your tips to live.

05:53.836 --> 05:58.235
You know what this is? It's the world's
smallest violin playing just for the waitresses.

05:59.122 --> 06:02.227
You don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.774
These people bust their ass.

06:03.828 --> 06:05.507
This is a hard job.

06:05.681 --> 06:08.792
So's working at McDonald's but you don't
feel the need to tip them, do you?

06:08.793 --> 06:10.171
Why not? They're serving you food.

06:10.226 --> 06:12.695
But no, society says, "Don't
tip these guys here,"

06:12.696 --> 06:15.018
"but tip these guys over
here." That's bullshit.

06:15.019 --> 06:16.961
Waitressing is the
number-one occupation

06:17.015 --> 06:19.974
for female non-college
graduates in this country.

06:20.266 --> 06:24.388
It's the one job basically any woman
can get and make a living on.

06:24.389 --> 06:26.358
The reason is because
of their tips.

06:27.669 --> 06:29.188
Fuck all that.

06:31.403 --> 06:32.488
Jesus Christ!

06:32.504 --> 06:34.494
I mean I'm very sorry the
government taxes their tips.

06:34.507 --> 06:36.936
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

06:36.937 --> 06:39.022
You know it appears waitresses
are one of the groups

06:39.066 --> 06:41.382
the government fucks in the
ass on a regular basis.

06:41.425 --> 06:44.874
I mean, if you show me a piece of paper that says
they shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

06:44.943 --> 06:47.742
Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.
What I won't do is play ball.

06:47.775 --> 06:51.614
And this non-college bullshit you're giving me,
I got two words for that: learn to fuckin' type.

06:51.727 --> 06:55.286
If you expect me to help out with the
rent, you're in for a fuckin' surprise.

06:55.312 --> 06:57.007
He's convinced me. Give
me my dollar back.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.545
Hey,

06:58.954 --> 07:00.873
leave the dollars there.

07:01.730 --> 07:03.889
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

07:05.137 --> 07:07.536
Wait a minute. Who
didn't throw in?

07:07.986 --> 07:10.265
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

07:10.634 --> 07:13.416
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

07:13.417 --> 07:16.574
He don't tip? What do you
mean, you don't tip?

07:16.628 --> 07:18.827
- He don't believe in it.
- Shut up.

07:19.143 --> 07:21.065
What do you mean you
don't believe in it?

07:21.066 --> 07:23.425
Come on, you, cough up a
buck, you cheap bastard.

07:23.506 --> 07:25.265
I paid for your
goddamn breakfast.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.587
All right, since you
paid for breakfast, I'll put in,

07:27.631 --> 07:29.749
put in, but normally, I
would never do this.

07:31.466 --> 07:33.625
Never mind what you
normally would do.

07:33.706 --> 07:37.225
Just cough in your goddamn
buck like everybody else.

07:37.226 --> 07:38.610
Thank you!

10:19.991 --> 10:22.830
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

10:24.226 --> 10:26.465
Er... are you a doctor?

10:27.287 --> 10:29.006
Are you a doctor?

10:29.141 --> 10:31.179
Answer me, please -
are you a doctor?

10:32.506 --> 10:35.350
- Huh?
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

10:35.351 --> 10:39.470
Okay. So you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.

10:39.746 --> 10:42.592
So, if you're through giving
me your amateur opinion,

10:42.663 --> 10:44.265
just lie back
and listen to the news.

10:44.346 --> 10:46.585
I'm taking you back
to the rendezvous.

10:46.627 --> 10:51.386
Joe's gonna get you a doctor, this
doctor's gonna fix you up and...

10:51.586 --> 10:53.557
you're gonna be okay.

10:53.685 --> 10:54.677
Now say it!

10:54.678 --> 10:57.493
You're gonna be okay.

10:57.494 --> 10:58.791
Say it!

10:58.866 --> 11:01.705
You're gonna be okay!

11:01.786 --> 11:04.865
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

11:04.946 --> 11:08.673

- Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

11:09.985 --> 11:12.104
I'm okay, Larry.

11:12.257 --> 11:14.056
Correct!

11:14.293 --> 11:15.852
Correct.

11:18.226 --> 11:20.145
I'm okay.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.305

- Larry...

11:33.386 --> 11:35.945
you gotta save me, man!

11:36.026 --> 11:37.235
You gotta save me!

11:37.236 --> 11:39.483
- We're in the warehouse.
- Oh!

11:39.986 --> 11:43.945
Who's a tough guy? Who's a tough guy?

11:44.473 --> 11:47.426
- Come on, who's a tough guy?
- I'm a tough guy.

11:47.466 --> 11:50.425
- Who's a tough guy? You're a tough guy.
- Larry!

11:50.426 --> 11:52.272
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.665
Okay. Okay...

11:57.746 --> 12:00.505
We're in the warehouse.
Look where we are.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.945
We made it. We made it.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.627
We fuckin' made it.

12:04.628 --> 12:07.058
- We have fuckin' made it.
- Ohh!

12:08.146 --> 12:10.465
We're in the warehouse.
Look where we are.

12:12.670 --> 12:13.866
Look where we are.

12:13.936 --> 12:16.405
So hold on, buddy boy, hold on.

12:16.479 --> 12:18.318
Hold on, hold on.

12:18.420 --> 12:20.945
Oh... shit!

12:21.026 --> 12:24.225
Quit banging your head. You're
gonna bang a fuckin' hole in the floor!

12:25.912 --> 12:28.705
Yeah, you don't wanna hurt the
fuckin' floor, do you?

12:29.357 --> 12:31.721
- Oh!
- I can't do anything for you.

12:31.826 --> 12:33.585
But when Joe gets here...

12:34.706 --> 12:36.585
which should be any time now,

12:36.666 --> 12:39.785
he's gonna help you out.
He's gonna take care of you.

12:39.866 --> 12:42.305
Okay? We're just gonna sit
here and we're gonna wait for Joe.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.085
Who are we waiting for?

12:46.603 --> 12:48.042
Joe.

12:52.045 --> 12:55.884
Larry, I'm just
fuckin' scared, man.

12:59.119 --> 13:01.198
Would you please hold me?

13:02.441 --> 13:04.120
Yeah, sure.

13:29.490 --> 13:31.369
You go ahead and be scared.

13:32.557 --> 13:34.636
You've been brave
enough for one day.

13:39.066 --> 13:42.105
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

13:42.686 --> 13:45.036
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

13:45.037 --> 13:48.019
When Joe gets here, he'll
make you 100 percent again.

13:49.931 --> 13:52.890
I'm hurt, and I'm
hurt bad, Larry.

13:53.478 --> 13:55.797
It's not good, no.

13:56.699 --> 13:59.392
Larry...

13:59.396 --> 14:02.355
bless your heart for what
you're trying to do.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.825
I was panicking for a
minute back there...

14:07.346 --> 14:09.505
but I got my senses back now.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.561
The situation is... I'm
shot in the belly.

14:13.639 --> 14:16.305
Without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

14:20.372 --> 14:22.091
I can't take you to a hospital.

14:22.172 --> 14:23.811
Fuck jail, man!

14:23.907 --> 14:27.801
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front.

14:28.466 --> 14:31.665
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

14:34.670 --> 14:38.389
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.345
I swear to fuckin' God, man.

14:43.444 --> 14:46.819
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

14:48.271 --> 14:52.585
I won't tell them anything.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.739
You'll be safe, man.

14:56.506 --> 14:59.585
You're not gonna fuckin'
die, kid, all right?

15:00.439 --> 15:03.368
Listen to me: you're
gonna be fine.

15:05.035 --> 15:09.613
Along with the kneecap, the gut is the
most painful area a guy can get shot in...

15:09.668 --> 15:10.934
No shit.

15:10.981 --> 15:13.596
But it takes a long
time to die from it.

15:13.717 --> 15:15.441
I'm talkin' days.

15:16.292 --> 15:20.331
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

15:20.546 --> 15:21.785
Time is on your side.

15:22.136 --> 15:26.025
- Was that a fuckin' setup or what?
- Fuckin' right.

15:26.146 --> 15:28.305
Shit. Orange got tagged?

15:29.142 --> 15:30.861
Gut shot.

15:31.146 --> 15:33.778
Fuck. Where's, er... Brown?

15:33.848 --> 15:34.771
Dead.

15:34.772 --> 15:37.426
Fuck! How did he die?

15:38.292 --> 15:41.856
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.905
This is bad. This
is so fuckin' bad!

15:46.196 --> 15:47.795
Is it bad?

15:48.245 --> 15:49.964
As opposed to good?

15:50.906 --> 15:52.705
Man, this is fucked up.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.065
This is so fucked up!

15:55.146 --> 15:57.385
Somebody fucked us
up big-time, man!

16:00.676 --> 16:02.715
You really think we were set up?

16:03.124 --> 16:04.703
Do you even doubt it, man?

16:04.704 --> 16:06.746
I don't think we got set
up, I know we got set up.

16:06.789 --> 16:09.411
I mean, really, seriously, where
did all those cops come from, huh?

16:09.335 --> 16:11.561
One minute they're not
there, the next minute they're there!

16:11.615 --> 16:13.673
They're there! I didn't
hear any sirens.

16:14.127 --> 16:15.173
The alarm went off, okay?

16:15.196 --> 16:17.603
When an alarm goes off, you've got an
average of four minutes response time.

16:17.654 --> 16:20.306
Unless a patrol car is cruising that
street at that particular moment,

16:20.345 --> 16:22.923
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

16:22.979 --> 16:25.245
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there,

16:25.246 --> 16:26.130
all one of a barrel,

16:26.169 --> 16:30.208
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing and they were all just there!

16:30.938 --> 16:33.777
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars, okay?

16:33.139 --> 16:34.618
Those were the ones
responding to the alarm there

16:34.644 --> 16:38.485
but those first motherfuckers, I'm telling you
man, they were there and they were waiting for us.

16:38.637 --> 16:40.836
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

16:41.245 --> 16:43.324
I haven't had a chance to think.

16:43.906 --> 16:46.265
First, I just tried to get
the fuck out of there.

16:47.412 --> 16:50.102
And after we got away, I've
just been dealing with him.

16:50.103 --> 16:52.876
You better start fucking thinking about it
man, because that's all I'm thinking about.

16:52.906 --> 16:55.999
Now, I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was gonna drive... just drive off, man,

16:56.023 --> 16:58.499
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

16:58.579 --> 16:59.944
There could've been cops
here waiting for us.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.288
They could be coming here right now!

17:06.066 --> 17:09.145
Let's go in the other room.
Hey, in there.

17:10.593 --> 17:11.960
Please, don't leave me.

17:12.015 --> 17:13.454
I'm gonna die.

17:13.498 --> 17:16.680
I'm just gonna be in that room.
Just over the other side.

17:16.752 --> 17:20.136
I'll be back in a minute, okay?
I'll be right there looking at you.

17:20.182 --> 17:21.820
I'm right here
looking at you, okay?

17:24.098 --> 17:26.464
Right in here. Right over there.

17:37.506 --> 17:40.185
What the fuck
am I doing here, man?

17:40.266 --> 17:42.328
You know I felt funny
about this job right off.

17:42.329 --> 17:46.079
As soon as I felt it I should've said "No, thank you"
and just walked, but I didn't fuckin' listen!

17:46.107 --> 17:48.695
It was like that every time I got
caught buying weed. Same thing, man.

17:48.496 --> 17:51.222
I didn't trust the guy, I felt funny
about it, but I wanted to believe him, you know.

17:51.261 --> 17:54.222
Because if he's not lying and it really is
Thai stick then it's great, right?

17:54.277 --> 17:55.222
But no, it's never Thai stick.

17:55.269 --> 17:58.300
And I always said if I felt that way about
a job I'd fuckin' walk and I didn't!

17:58.347 --> 18:00.921
I didn't cause of the fuckin' money.

18:00.991 --> 18:03.523
What's done is done.
We need you cool.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.265
Are you cool?

18:07.806 --> 18:09.503
All right, I'm cool.

18:10.958 --> 18:13.037
Splash some water on your face.

18:17.002 --> 18:19.041
Take a breather.

18:33.469 --> 18:35.868
Relax. Have a cigarette.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.655
- I quit.
- All right.

18:39.656 --> 18:41.575
Why, you got one?

18:49.133 --> 18:50.612
Yeah.

18:52.454 --> 18:55.373
Here you go. Have
a Chesterfield.

18:55.508 --> 18:57.347
Thanks.

19:14.379 --> 19:16.978
Okay. Let's go through
what happened.

19:17.013 --> 19:17.977
Okay.

19:17.978 --> 19:20.192
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.464
- Then the alarm gets tripped.
- Right.

19:24.145 --> 19:27.064
Then I turn around and all
these cops are outside.

19:29.506 --> 19:32.825
Yeah, right, bam, I blink
my eyes and they're there.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.065
Everybody starts going ape shit.

19:35.186 --> 19:37.265
Then Mr. Blond starts
to shoot all the...

19:37.346 --> 19:40.352
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

19:40.353 --> 19:43.996
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

19:44.132 --> 19:47.731
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blond started shooting everybody.

19:47.804 --> 19:50.963
- As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
- No, I'm telling you, it wasn't that soon, okay?

19:50.964 --> 19:54.964
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blond became a madman, right?

19:54.965 --> 19:57.380
I'm not saying they weren't there.
I'm saying they were there.

19:57.403 --> 20:01.882
But they didn't make their move until after
Mr. Blond started shooting everybody.

20:01.916 --> 20:03.915
I mean, that's how I know
we were set up.

20:05.092 --> 20:08.279
- Come on, Mr. White, I mean, you can see that.
- Look, look, enough of this Mr. White shit!

20:08.326 --> 20:10.414
Wait, wait, wait, man. Don't tell
me your fuckin' name.

20:10.427 --> 20:12.071
I don't wanna know it.

20:12.072 --> 20:14.511
Jesus Christ, I ain't
gonna tell you mine.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.042
You're right, this is bad.

20:27.586 --> 20:29.745
How did you get out?

20:29.834 --> 20:33.233
I shot my way out. Everybody started
shooting, so I blasted my way out of there.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.056
Move it! Get out of the way!

20:40.146 --> 20:42.130
Get the fuck out of the way!

20:43.459 --> 20:45.928
Get the fuck out of the way!

20:46.986 --> 20:48.825
Move it! Get out of the way!

20:54.466 --> 20:57.585
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck is your problem, man?

20:57.666 --> 20:59.705
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck off!

21:00.866 --> 21:03.345
- Move!
- Keep down, Ernie!

21:09.790 --> 21:11.134
- Jesus!
- My car!

21:11.147 --> 21:13.313
Get the fuck out of the car!

21:13.761 --> 21:16.000
Move it! Move out of the way!

21:44.386 --> 21:46.065
I tagged a couple of cops.

21:46.935 --> 21:48.574
Did you kill anybody?

21:49.077 --> 21:50.676
A few cops.

21:50.984 --> 21:53.826
- No real people?
- Just cops.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.923
Man, could you
believe Mr. Blond?

22:09.035 --> 22:11.714
That was the most insane fuckin'
thing I have ever seen.

22:12.545 --> 22:15.205
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

22:15.206 --> 22:16.545
I don't wanna kill anybody,

22:17.352 --> 22:20.151
but if I gotta get out that
door and you're standing in my way,

22:19.506 --> 22:21.601
one way or the other you're
getting out of my way.

22:21.624 --> 22:23.783
That's the way I look at it.

22:24.186 --> 22:28.905
A choice between doing ten years or
taking out some stupid motherfucker...

22:30.586 --> 22:32.025
ain't no choice at all.

22:32.816 --> 22:34.838
But I ain't no madman either.

22:34.839 --> 22:39.753
What the fuck was Joe thinking? I
can't work with a guy like that.

22:41.837 --> 22:45.236
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

22:45.286 --> 22:49.085
I came this close to
taking his ass out myself.

22:49.426 --> 22:52.385
I mean, everybody
panics, everybody.

22:53.404 --> 22:55.646
Things get tense. It's
human nature to panic.

22:55.687 --> 22:59.036
I don't care what your name
is, you can't help it.

22:59.037 --> 23:02.835
Fuck, man, you panic on the
inside, in your head, you know?

23:03.430 --> 23:07.077
Then you give yourself a couple of
seconds, you get a hold of the situation,

23:07.078 --> 23:10.454
you deal with it. What you don't
do is start shootin' up the place and start killing people!

23:10.488 --> 23:14.327
No, what you're supposed to do is
act like a fuckin' professional.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.157
A psychopath ain't
a professional.

23:17.378 --> 23:19.217
I can't work with a psychopath.

23:19.338 --> 23:22.337
You don't know what those sick
assholes are gonna do next.

23:23.466 --> 23:28.185
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was, 20?

23:28.736 --> 23:30.900
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

23:32.586 --> 23:35.025
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

23:36.306 --> 23:39.985
Me and Orange jumped in the
car, Brown floored it.

23:40.066 --> 23:42.065
After that, I don't
know what went down.

23:42.186 --> 23:44.185
At that point, it was
every man for himself.

23:44.993 --> 23:48.752
As far as Mr. Blond and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest.

23:47.381 --> 23:49.376
'Cause once I got out I never looked back.

23:49.433 --> 23:51.321
What do you think?

23:51.647 --> 23:54.966
What do I think? I mean, you know, the
cops either caught them or killed them.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.261
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

23:59.404 --> 24:01.323
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

24:01.833 --> 24:04.872
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

24:06.586 --> 24:09.054
You don't think they fought for 'em and
they got a hold of the diamonds and...

24:09.146 --> 24:10.929
No, no way.

24:10.959 --> 24:13.038
How can you be so sure?

24:13.943 --> 24:16.342
I got the diamonds.

24:23.906 --> 24:25.505
That's my boy.

24:26.346 --> 24:29.265
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

24:29.673 --> 24:33.377
Look, if you wanna come with me, let's
go get 'em right now, right this second, man.

24:33.426 --> 24:35.185
Cause I think staying here, man,

24:35.266 --> 24:37.425
we should have our
fuckin' heads examined.

24:37.506 --> 24:41.185
- That was the plan. We meet here.
- Then where the fuck is everybody?

24:41.266 --> 24:44.585
I say the plan becomes null and void once
we find out we got a rat in the house.

24:44.619 --> 24:47.739
We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what
happened to Mr. Blond and Mr. Blue.

24:47.755 --> 24:49.754
I mean, they could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

24:49.773 --> 24:53.231
The cops could have them right now at
the station house, sweatin' them down.

24:53.234 --> 24:56.833
Yeah, they don't know our names but they
could be singing about this place.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.625
I swear to God, I think
I'm fuckin' jinxed.

25:08.564 --> 25:10.123
What?

25:12.115 --> 25:15.234
Two jobs back, it
was a four-man job.

25:15.277 --> 25:18.116
We discovered one of the
team was an undercover cop.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.261
No shit?

25:22.650 --> 25:25.225
Thank God we discovered in time.

25:25.259 --> 25:28.938
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

25:29.268 --> 25:31.347
So who's the rat this time?

25:31.553 --> 25:33.495
Mr. Blue?

25:33.541 --> 25:35.380
Mr. Brown?

25:35.430 --> 25:36.769
Joe?

25:36.801 --> 25:39.544
You know, listen, I mean, Joe set this
whole thing up. Maybe he set it up...

25:39.592 --> 25:43.090
No, I don't bite. Me and
Joe go back a long time.

25:43.146 --> 25:46.585
I can tell you definitely, Joe don't know
a fuckin' thing about this bullshit.

25:46.666 --> 25:48.425
Hey look, I've known Joe
since I was a kid, okay,

25:48.506 --> 25:51.628
and me saying he definitely had
nothing to do with it is ridiculous.

25:51.629 --> 25:54.548
I mean, I can say I definitely didn't do
it cause I know what I did or didn't do,

25:54.549 --> 25:57.854
but I cannot say that about anybody
else, cause I don't definitely know.

25:58.045 --> 26:00.164
For all I know, you're the rat.

26:00.253 --> 26:02.718
For all I know, you're
the fuckin' rat!

26:02.719 --> 26:05.102
All right, now you're
using your fuckin' head.

26:05.167 --> 26:06.846
For all we know, he's the rat.

26:06.881 --> 26:11.102
Hey, that kid in there is dying from
a fuckin' bullet I saw him take,

26:11.124 --> 26:12.763
so don't you be
calling him a rat!

26:13.071 --> 26:15.655
Look... I'm right, okay?

26:15.656 --> 26:17.735
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

26:22.908 --> 26:25.540
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

26:28.419 --> 26:32.378
Go down the hall, make a left, go
up the stairs and make a right.

26:40.828 --> 26:42.627
By the way, how's Alabama?

26:42.763 --> 26:44.722
Alabama?

26:44.780 --> 26:47.179
I haven't seen 'Bama in
over a year and a half.

26:48.346 --> 26:50.225
I thought you two were a team.

26:52.196 --> 26:53.853
We were for a little while.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.572
We did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

26:57.706 --> 26:59.305
Why?

27:02.186 --> 27:06.145
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

27:06.578 --> 27:08.099
What's she doing now?

27:08.100 --> 27:10.170
She hooked up with Frank McGarr.

27:10.226 --> 27:13.705
They've done a couple jobs together.
Hell of a woman. Good little thief.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.810
So, explain the telegram.

27:19.814 --> 27:21.313
Five-man job,

27:21.314 --> 27:23.891
busting in and busting out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

27:24.026 --> 27:27.166
Can you move the ice afterwards? I
don't know nobody that can move ice.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.454
No problem. We got
guys waiting for it.

27:29.860 --> 27:32.782
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

27:32.826 --> 27:35.185
He's doing 20 years
in Susanville.

27:35.375 --> 27:37.572
20 years! Holy God.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.852
- What for?
- Bad luck.

27:40.300 --> 27:42.179
I guess you can say that again.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.026
- What's the exposure like?
- Two minutes tops,

27:46.086 --> 27:47.769
but it's a tough two minutes.

27:47.826 --> 27:51.785
Daylight, during business
hours, dealing with a crowd.

27:51.866 --> 27:53.895
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

27:53.896 --> 27:56.723
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

27:56.866 --> 27:58.505
Security pretty lax.

27:58.555 --> 28:00.754
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

28:00.946 --> 28:04.265
You know, uncut stones from
the diamond syndicate.

28:04.307 --> 28:09.004
But on this particular day, they're getting
a shipment of polished stones from Israel.

28:09.005 --> 28:13.500
They're like a way-station, you know. They're to get
picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.

28:13.528 --> 28:15.487
No, they're not.

28:18.066 --> 28:20.225
What's the cut, Papa?

28:20.306 --> 28:22.065
Juicy, Junior,

28:22.146 --> 28:24.945
real juicy.

28:26.488 --> 28:29.887
Hey, look, man, you do what you want.
I'm out of here, man.

28:29.961 --> 28:31.920
I'm gonna check into a
motel for a few days.

28:32.018 --> 28:34.497
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.972
Oh, shit, did he
fuckin' die on us?

28:39.346 --> 28:41.158
Huh? Is he dead or what?

28:43.466 --> 28:46.785
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

28:46.906 --> 28:48.345
I think he's just passed out.

28:49.426 --> 28:53.505
Scared the fuckin' shit out of me, man.
I thought he was dead for sure.

28:53.540 --> 28:56.179
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

28:57.266 --> 28:59.985
What are we gonna do, man? We can't
take him to a hospital.

29:02.066 --> 29:05.865
Without medical attention, that man
might not live through the night.

29:06.469 --> 29:09.033
The bullet in his
belly is my fault.

29:09.034 --> 29:12.477
Now while that may not mean jack shit to
you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

29:12.746 --> 29:16.697
First things first, okay? Staying
here is goofy. We gotta book up.

29:16.698 --> 29:18.780
What do you suggest we
do - go to a hotel?

29:19.104 --> 29:20.928
We got a guy who's
shot in the belly.

29:20.929 --> 29:23.303
He can't walk, he bleeds
like a stuck pig.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.943
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

29:26.915 --> 29:28.945
You got an idea, spit it out!

29:29.392 --> 29:30.837
Joe could help.

29:30.878 --> 29:33.117
If we could get in
touch with Joe...

29:33.386 --> 29:37.745
Joe could get him to a doctor. Joe
could get a doctor to come to see him.

29:38.706 --> 29:42.585
Assuming we can trust Joe, how are
we gonna get in touch with him?

29:42.932 --> 29:47.164
Huh? He should be here but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about being here.

29:47.165 --> 29:50.794
Even if he is on the up-and-up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us, okay?

29:50.843 --> 29:53.442
He planned a robbery and he's
got a blood bath on his hands now.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.301
He's got dead cops, dead
robbers, dead civilians.

29:56.805 --> 29:59.989
Jesus Christ, I doubt he'll have a
lot of sympathy for our plight.

29:59.990 --> 30:05.105
I mean, if I was him I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as humanly possible.

30:08.346 --> 30:14.665
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was asking
me to take him to a doctor, to a hospital.

30:16.786 --> 30:19.945
Now, I don't like the idea of
turning him over to the cops,

30:20.026 --> 30:21.705
but if we don't, he's gonna die.

30:22.626 --> 30:24.585
He begged me to do it.

30:26.025 --> 30:29.516
Well... all right, then I guess
we take him to a hospital.

30:29.517 --> 30:31.384
I mean, if that's what he
said, let's do it.

30:31.854 --> 30:34.773
Since he don't know nothing about
us, I say it's his decision.

30:34.774 --> 30:36.251
Well, he knows a
little about me.

30:39.437 --> 30:42.836
What? Wait, wait. You didn't
tell him your name, did you?

30:42.886 --> 30:45.645
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

30:45.946 --> 30:47.425
Why?

30:49.106 --> 30:53.705
I told him where I was from a few days ago.
It was just a natural conversation.

30:54.442 --> 30:57.201
What was telling him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

30:57.525 --> 30:58.964
He asked.

31:00.693 --> 31:04.172
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.951
It was my fault he got shot.

31:07.797 --> 31:10.146
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

31:10.213 --> 31:11.892
He's screamin'.

31:12.706 --> 31:16.065
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

31:16.146 --> 31:17.945
I'm trying to comfort him...

31:18.974 --> 31:23.613
telling him not to worry, everything's
gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him,

31:23.709 --> 31:25.588
and he asked me
what my name was.

31:27.766 --> 31:32.547
I mean, the man was dying in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

31:33.826 --> 31:38.838
Tell him, "I'm sorry, I can't give
out that fuckin' information."

31:38.839 --> 31:40.737
"It's against the rules"?

31:41.666 --> 31:44.625
"I don't trust you enough"?

31:44.746 --> 31:48.108
Well, maybe I should
have but I couldn't!

31:48.109 --> 31:50.468
- I don't...
- Fuck you and fuck Joe!

31:50.901 --> 31:53.795
- I'm sure it was a very beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

31:53.796 --> 31:56.595
I have one question for you. Do they have a
sheet on you where you're from?

31:56.596 --> 31:58.842
- Yeah!
- Well, that's that, then, man.

31:58.901 --> 32:01.900
I mean, Jesus Christ, I was worried about
mug-shot possibilities as it was.

32:01.901 --> 32:04.119
Now he knows A, your name,
B, what you look like,

32:04.183 --> 32:06.182
C, where you're from,
and D, what your specialty is!

32:06.225 --> 32:09.504
They're not gonna have to show him
a hell of a lot of pictures for him to pick you out.

32:09.532 --> 32:13.092
I mean that's it, right? You didn't tell anything
else that can narrow down the selection?

32:13.346 --> 32:16.745
If I have to tell you again to back
off, we are gonna go round and round.

32:16.866 --> 32:18.705
We ain't taking him
to a hospital.

32:20.026 --> 32:21.665
If we don't, he's gonna die.

32:21.699 --> 32:24.578
I'm very sad about that but some
fellas are lucky and some ain't.

32:24.786 --> 32:27.505
What the fuck are you
touching me for, man?

32:32.306 --> 32:34.865
You wanna fuck with me? I'll show
you who you're fucking with.

32:34.946 --> 32:37.539
You wanna shoot me, you
piece of shit? Go ahead, take a shot.

32:37.553 --> 32:40.883
Fuck you, White, I didn't create
this situation, I'm dealing with it!

32:40.909 --> 32:42.857
You're acting like a
first-year fuckin' thief!

32:42.858 --> 32:44.392
I'm acting like a professional.

32:44.393 --> 32:45.812
They get him, they
could get you.

32:45.847 --> 32:48.838
They get you, they get closer
to me and that can't happen.

32:49.128 --> 32:50.846
You're looking at me
like it's my fault!

32:50.886 --> 32:54.145
I didn't tell him my name.
I didn't tell him where I was from!

32:54.479 --> 32:57.185
Shit, 15 minutes ago, you
almost told me your name!

32:57.226 --> 32:59.351
Your buddy got us stuck in a
situation you created.

32:59.372 --> 33:02.651
So if you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

33:03.012 --> 33:05.891
You kids shouldn't
play so rough,

33:06.106 --> 33:08.625
somebody's gonna start crying.

33:08.878 --> 33:10.077
Mr. Blond.

33:12.606 --> 33:14.945
Shit. Fucking kicking me.

33:19.638 --> 33:23.956
What happened to you?
I figured you were dead.

33:27.186 --> 33:29.745
Hey, are you okay?

33:31.306 --> 33:33.465
Did you see what
happened to Blue?

33:33.546 --> 33:35.354
We didn't know what
happened to you and Blue.

33:34.906 --> 33:37.360
That's what we were
wondering about. Come on, man.

33:39.278 --> 33:42.157
Look, Brown is dead, Orange
got it in the belly...

33:42.158 --> 33:44.412
Enough! Enough!

33:44.413 --> 33:46.452
You better start
talking, asshole...

33:47.558 --> 33:49.637
cause we got shit we
need to talk about.

33:50.478 --> 33:52.277
We're already freaked out.

33:52.328 --> 33:55.836
We need you acting freaky like we
need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

33:56.729 --> 33:58.288
Okay, let's talk.

33:59.196 --> 34:03.453
- We think we got a rat in the house.
- I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

34:03.454 --> 34:04.907
What makes you say that?

34:04.908 --> 34:06.704
Is that supposed to be funny?

34:06.982 --> 34:09.460
Look, we think this
place ain't safe.

34:10.127 --> 34:13.127
This place just ain't secure any more.
We're leaving. You should go with us.

34:13.504 --> 34:15.743
Nobody's going anywhere.

34:15.918 --> 34:18.619
Piss on this fuckin' turd!

34:19.016 --> 34:22.176
- We're out of here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

34:22.766 --> 34:25.165
Fuck you, maniac!

34:27.994 --> 34:30.181
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

34:30.415 --> 34:32.344
What's this guy's problem?

34:32.346 --> 34:35.143
What's my problem? Yeah,
I got a fuckin' problem.

34:35.226 --> 34:37.799
I got a big fuckin' problem...

34:38.146 --> 34:41.739
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

34:42.706 --> 34:44.864
What the fuck are
you talking about?

34:44.946 --> 34:47.099
That fuckin' shooting spree!

34:47.822 --> 34:50.141
In the store, remember?

34:50.222 --> 34:53.061
Oh, fuck 'em. They
set off the alarm.

34:53.346 --> 34:54.945
They deserve what they got.

34:55.065 --> 34:57.043
You almost killed me!

34:58.333 --> 35:00.012
Asshole!

35:01.750 --> 35:05.869
If I'd known what kind of guy you were, I
never would have agreed to work with you.

35:07.385 --> 35:09.944
Are you gonna bark all
day, little doggy...

35:11.586 --> 35:12.945
or are you gonna bite?

35:13.369 --> 35:15.448
What was that?

35:17.706 --> 35:19.990
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.

35:19.991 --> 35:21.470
Would you repeat it?

35:22.167 --> 35:25.166
Are you gonna bark all
day, little doggy...

35:26.654 --> 35:28.498
- or are you gonna bite?
- All right, hey look.

35:28.524 --> 35:31.523
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on! Let go.

35:31.706 --> 35:35.265
What, are we on a playground here, huh?
Am I the only professional?

35:35.346 --> 35:37.585
You're acting like a bunch
of fuckin' niggers, man!

35:37.666 --> 35:41.305
Have you worked with niggers? Just like you two.
Always saying they're gonna kill each other!

35:41.080 --> 35:42.862
You said you thought
about taking him out!

35:42.866 --> 35:43.979
You fucking said that?

35:43.980 --> 35:45.784
Yeah, I did, okay? I did.

35:45.805 --> 35:49.124
But that was then. Right now this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

35:49.486 --> 35:51.173
He's too fucking homicidal to
be in with the cops!

35:51.225 --> 35:52.393
You're taking his side?

35:52.394 --> 35:55.361
No, fuck sides! Man, what we need
here is a little solidarity.

35:55.429 --> 35:57.228
Somebody stuck a red-hot
poker up our ass

35:57.229 --> 35:59.559
and I wanna know whose
name's on the handle!

36:01.193 --> 36:02.252
Fuck.

36:02.253 --> 36:06.132
Look, I know I'm no piece of shit,
and I'm pretty sure you're okay,

36:06.527 --> 36:09.193
and I'm fuckin' positive
you're on the level,

36:09.256 --> 36:11.926
so let's try and figure out who
the bad guy is, all right?

36:14.786 --> 36:16.476
Wow!

36:16.477 --> 36:18.614
That was really exciting.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.039
I bet you're a big Lee
Marvin fan, aren't you?

36:25.570 --> 36:28.025
Yeah, me too. I love that guy.

36:30.386 --> 36:33.825
My heart's beating so fast I'm
about to have a heart attack here.

36:35.158 --> 36:39.797
I got something outside that, er, I'd
like to show you guys, so follow me.

36:39.863 --> 36:41.900
Follow you? Where?

36:42.961 --> 36:44.416
To my car.

36:45.546 --> 36:48.301
What, did you forget your French
fries to go with the soda?

36:48.302 --> 36:50.092
- No, I had them already.
- Yeah?

36:50.139 --> 36:53.938
I got something I think you might wanna
see, though. It's a big surprise.

36:54.052 --> 36:57.371
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

37:06.971 --> 37:09.050
We still gotta
get out of here, you know.

37:09.088 --> 37:12.005
No. We're gonna stick
around and we're gonna wait.

37:12.006 --> 37:15.064
- What for, the cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

37:15.388 --> 37:19.905
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he isn't
on a plane right now, halfway to Costa Rica?

37:19.986 --> 37:23.305
Because I spoke to him on the phone and
he said he's on the way down here.

37:23.426 --> 37:26.813
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck
didn't you say that in the first place?

37:26.814 --> 37:29.392
- Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fucking-har.

37:29.441 --> 37:32.200
- What did he say?
- He said stay put.

37:32.906 --> 37:35.265
So, in the meantime,

37:35.386 --> 37:37.305
let me show you guys something.

37:42.826 --> 37:44.265
Jesus Christ!

37:44.861 --> 37:47.736
Maybe our boy in blue here can
answer some of these questions

37:47.737 --> 37:50.490
about this rat business
you been talking about.

37:50.735 --> 37:53.334
You're a piece of
work, my friend.

37:53.821 --> 37:56.380
That ain't a bad Idea. Let's
get him the fuck out of here.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.734
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

38:00.883 --> 38:02.751
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

38:02.752 --> 38:04.424
I know you'll pay me back.

38:05.525 --> 38:08.444
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.813
So you had a few bad months.

38:12.097 --> 38:13.845
You do what everybody else does.

38:13.846 --> 38:18.472
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan or
Irving the tailor, you ride it out.

38:18.515 --> 38:21.114
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

38:21.142 --> 38:23.141
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

38:23.292 --> 38:25.091
Oh, tell him to come in.

38:25.187 --> 38:26.791
- I gotta go.
- Come on in.

38:26.792 --> 38:31.159
A friend of mine's outside. Keep your chin
up, I'll be talking to you. Don't worry.

38:35.903 --> 38:37.702
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

38:39.546 --> 38:41.847
How does freedom feel, huh?

38:41.848 --> 38:45.137
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

38:45.138 --> 38:48.176
Sit down, take your coat
off, make yourself at home.

38:48.177 --> 38:49.934
- Want a little drink?
- Yeah.

38:49.999 --> 38:52.678
How about a little Rémy Martin?

38:53.096 --> 38:54.928
Sure.

38:54.929 --> 38:56.608
Who's your parole officer?

38:58.626 --> 39:00.585
Seymour Scagnetti.

39:00.666 --> 39:02.425
How is he?

39:03.431 --> 39:04.990
He's a fuckin' asshole.

39:05.306 --> 39:07.225
Won't even let me leave
the halfway house.

39:07.306 --> 39:09.865
You know, it never
ceases to amaze me.

39:09.986 --> 39:14.409
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some
old woman's throat for 25 cents,

39:14.410 --> 39:16.831
he gets Doris Day for
a parole officer.

39:16.857 --> 39:20.923
Good fella like you winds up
with a ball-bustin' prick.

39:22.932 --> 39:26.211
I want you to know I appreciate all the
packages you sent me on the inside.

39:26.761 --> 39:30.579
What the hell was I supposed
to do, forget about you?

39:30.580 --> 39:33.120
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

39:33.121 --> 39:36.917
Hey, it was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could have done a lot more.

39:37.340 --> 39:39.019
Thanks a lot, Joe.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.773
Ah, Vic...

39:44.781 --> 39:46.420
Toothpick Vic.

39:48.426 --> 39:52.425
So, tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

39:52.506 --> 39:56.132
You son of a bitch. I see you sitting
there, but I don't believe it!

39:56.133 --> 39:58.397
- How you doing, Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

40:03.466 --> 40:06.364
Listen, I'm sorry. I should
have picked you up myself.

40:06.423 --> 40:09.420
I was... My fuckin'...
This week's been crazy.

40:09.421 --> 40:11.335
I've had my head up my
ass the whole time.

40:11.564 --> 40:14.883
It's funny you should say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were just talking about.

40:14.884 --> 40:16.513
That I should have
picked you up?

40:16.680 --> 40:19.039
No, that you had your
head up your ass.

40:21.826 --> 40:23.196
I walk in the door, he's like,

40:23.197 --> 40:27.365
"Vic, Vic I'm so glad somebody's finally
here who knows what's going on."

40:27.626 --> 40:30.185
"My son Eddie is a fuck-up."

40:30.266 --> 40:32.505
"He's ruining the business."

40:33.454 --> 40:37.173
"I mean, I love the guy but you know, he's
flushing everything down the toilet."

40:37.426 --> 40:40.665
I mean, that's what you said, right, Joe?
I mean, tell him yourself.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.345
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this, but

40:43.426 --> 40:46.305
well, Vic come in and asked
me how business was.

40:47.466 --> 40:50.665
You don't lie to a guy who's just
done four years in the slammer.

40:50.666 --> 40:52.620
Very true.

40:56.873 --> 40:59.716
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

40:59.798 --> 41:01.517
This ain't a playground!

41:05.666 --> 41:11.025
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

41:11.106 --> 41:12.985
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

41:13.986 --> 41:15.945
He got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me!

41:16.330 --> 41:17.290
You wish.

41:17.291 --> 41:20.751
You sick bastard. You tried to
fuck me in my father's office.

41:20.937 --> 41:25.456
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the
privacy of your own home, go to it,

41:25.506 --> 41:26.909
but don't try to fuck me.

41:26.910 --> 41:28.792
I mean, I don't think
of you that way.

41:29.014 --> 41:31.613
I like you a lot, buddy, but I
don't think of you that way.

41:35.106 --> 41:39.832
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy, I
wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.957
No, you wouldn't. You'd
keep me for yourself.

41:43.453 --> 41:45.605
You know, four years
fuckin' punks up the ass,

41:45.606 --> 41:47.735
you appreciate prime
rib when you see it.

41:47.782 --> 41:51.227
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

41:51.266 --> 41:52.895
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

41:52.957 --> 41:56.381
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger.

41:56.382 --> 42:00.707
You know what, I think it's all that black
semen been pumped up your ass so far now,

42:00.724 --> 42:04.683
it's backed into your fuckin'
brain, it's coming out your mouth!

42:04.756 --> 42:08.515
Eddie, you keep talking like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

42:08.746 --> 42:11.697
All right, enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

42:11.698 --> 42:13.247
Both of you, sit down!

42:18.966 --> 42:24.045
Now, Eddie, when you came in here, we
were talking some serious business.

42:25.353 --> 42:28.027
Now, Vic here's got
a parole problem.

42:28.028 --> 42:30.310
- Who's your PO?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

42:30.691 --> 42:33.330
Scagnetti. Fuck.

42:33.624 --> 42:36.583
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

42:37.206 --> 42:40.605
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

42:40.896 --> 42:43.375
You come back to
work for us, right?

42:46.343 --> 42:48.222
Well, I wanna,

42:48.249 --> 42:51.335
but first I gotta prove
to asshead

42:51.400 --> 42:54.835
that I can get a regular, you
know, job, job-type job,

42:54.872 --> 42:56.591
before I can move out on my own.

42:58.153 --> 42:59.896
I can't come back to
work for you guys

42:59.897 --> 43:02.247
if I gotta worry about
making some silly-ass

43:02.284 --> 43:04.902
ten o'clock curfew
every fuckin' night.

43:05.806 --> 43:09.285
All right, we can work
this out, can't we, Eddie?

43:09.546 --> 43:11.265
This ain't all that bad.

43:11.386 --> 43:13.705
Look, we can get you a
lot of legitimate jobs.

43:14.613 --> 43:17.212
I'll get you down in Long
Beach as a dock worker.

43:17.371 --> 43:19.490
I don't wanna lift no
fuckin' crates, Eddie.

43:19.491 --> 43:22.124
Vic, you're not gonna lift shit.

43:22.386 --> 43:24.305
You don't even work there.

43:24.386 --> 43:27.105
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

43:27.451 --> 43:29.865
I'll call Matthews the foreman,
and tell him he's got a new guy.

43:29.891 --> 43:32.013
Boom, you're on the rotation.

43:32.059 --> 43:35.498
You get a time card, it's clocked
in and out for you every day.

43:35.533 --> 43:37.621
And at the end of the week
you get a nice paycheck.

43:37.622 --> 43:39.404
Dock workers do very well.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.874
So you can move into a halfway decent
place without Scagnetti fucking going,

43:42.902 --> 43:45.021
"Hey, where the fuck's the
money come from?"

43:45.213 --> 43:48.612
And if he decides to
make a surprise visit,

43:48.755 --> 43:53.394
that's the day we've sent you to Tustin, to
pick up a load of shit and bring it back.

43:53.460 --> 43:55.408
If he comes back again

43:55.507 --> 43:57.465
"Hey, sorry, Seymour,
you just missed him."

43:58.084 --> 44:01.682
"We had to send him to Taft
airstrip five fuckin' hours away."

44:01.683 --> 44:04.682
"We had a load of shit we had
to have him pick up there and bring back here."

44:04.683 --> 44:08.040
Look, part of your job is going different
places, that's the beauty of it.

44:08.130 --> 44:10.809
We got places all
over the place.

44:10.913 --> 44:12.992
See, Vic, did I tell
you not to worry?

44:13.112 --> 44:17.174
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you out to Long Beach tomorrow.

44:17.226 --> 44:21.025
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

44:22.732 --> 44:25.331
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doing,

44:25.366 --> 44:30.525
but I'd like to know when I can come
back, you know, do some real work.

44:31.466 --> 44:35.985
Well, it's hard to say. It's
kind of a strange time now.

44:36.988 --> 44:37.984
Things are kind of...

44:37.985 --> 44:39.963
They're a little fucked
up is what they are.

44:41.827 --> 44:44.785
Look, we're just getting ready
for a big meeting now in Vegas.

44:45.069 --> 44:49.548
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

44:49.582 --> 44:52.864
Get you a job, give
you some cash,

44:52.865 --> 44:55.944
and get this Scagnetti
fuck off your back.

44:56.306 --> 44:58.385
Then we'll talk to
you, all right?

44:59.384 --> 45:03.783
- Huh?
- Dad... I got an idea.

45:04.106 --> 45:06.225
Now, just... just hear me out.

45:07.087 --> 45:10.727
I know you don't like using
the boys on these jobs...

45:10.728 --> 45:15.067
but Vic here, I mean, he's only
been nothing but good luck for us.

45:15.266 --> 45:18.305
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's
foot, for crying out loud.

45:19.382 --> 45:21.301
I'd like to have him in.

45:21.758 --> 45:25.077
You know he can handle himself and you
damn sure know you can trust him.

45:27.106 --> 45:29.145
Now, Vic,

45:29.226 --> 45:33.105
how would you feel about pulling a
job with about five other guys?

45:35.746 --> 45:37.825
I'd feel great about it.

47:48.873 --> 47:51.352
What in the Sam
Hill's going on here?

47:51.426 --> 47:54.305
- You're asking what's going on?
- Hey, Nice Guy, we got a cop.

47:55.586 --> 47:57.825
Holy shit, Orange is dead.

47:58.343 --> 48:01.964
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

48:01.965 --> 48:04.467
We were set up. The cops
were there waiting for us.

48:04.468 --> 48:06.562
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up!

48:06.614 --> 48:09.278
- The cops were there waiting for us, man!
- Bullshit.

48:09.309 --> 48:13.585
Hey fuck you, man. You weren't there, we were. And
I'm telling you, the cops had that store staked out.

48:13.759 --> 48:18.158
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective, you're
so fuckin' smart, huh, who did it?

48:18.176 --> 48:20.415
What the hell do you
think we've been asking each other?

48:20.416 --> 48:24.082
Yeah, what did you come up with, huh?
You think I did it? You think I fuckin' set you up?

48:24.139 --> 48:26.978
I don't know, but somebody did.

48:27.512 --> 48:28.871
Nobody did.

48:28.946 --> 48:30.874
You fuckin' assholes turn
a jewelery store...

48:30.887 --> 48:32.709
Don't you call me an asshole!

48:32.710 --> 48:33.820
You fuckin' idiots

48:33.846 --> 48:36.171
- turn a fuckin' jewelery store into a Wild West show,
- Don't you call me a fucking idiot.

48:36.215 --> 48:39.774
...and you wonder why the fucking cops show up?

48:40.526 --> 48:41.605
Where's Joseph?

48:42.116 --> 48:44.336
I don't know. I ain't
talked to him.

48:44.337 --> 48:48.275
I talked to Dove. He said Daddy's coming
down here and he's fuckin' pissed!

48:48.598 --> 48:50.997
He's pissed? I told
you he'd be pissed.

48:51.266 --> 48:52.518
What'd Joe say?

48:52.519 --> 48:54.503
I told you I ain't
talked to him!

48:54.546 --> 48:56.292
All I know is he's pissed!

48:56.425 --> 48:57.984
What are you gonna do about him?

48:58.043 --> 49:00.541
Jesus Christ, give me a
fuckin' chance to breathe.

49:00.542 --> 49:03.359
- I got a few questions of my own.
- You ain't dying, he is!

49:03.394 --> 49:06.909
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

49:06.974 --> 49:08.453
Who?

49:08.845 --> 49:12.344
A fuckin' snake charmer! Who do you think?
I'll call a doctor!

49:12.345 --> 49:13.922
He'll fix him right up.

49:14.128 --> 49:16.607
Now, what happened
to Brown and Blue?

49:16.672 --> 49:18.632
Brown's dead. We don't
know what happened to Blue.

49:18.666 --> 49:21.180
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

49:21.251 --> 49:23.195
I'm sure. I was there.

49:23.223 --> 49:24.845
He took one in the head.

49:24.846 --> 49:27.273
Nobody's got a clue what
happened to Mr. Blue?

49:27.274 --> 49:29.266
Either he's alive or he's dead,

49:29.327 --> 49:32.508
or the cops got him...
or they don't.

49:35.197 --> 49:37.851
I take it this is the
bastard you told me about?

49:37.852 --> 49:39.625
Why are you beating on him?

49:39.706 --> 49:42.118
Maybe he can tell us who
the fuck set us up.

49:42.119 --> 49:46.658
If you fuckin' beat this prick long enough,
he'll tell you he started the goddamn Chicago Fire.

49:46.684 --> 49:49.697
Now, that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

49:49.786 --> 49:51.625
Come on, man, think!

49:51.626 --> 49:56.265
All right, first things fuckin' last.
Who's got the stones?

49:56.386 --> 50:00.105
Please, somebody at least tell me one
little fuckin' favor just for my sake.

50:00.186 --> 50:02.425
I got a bag. I got a bag, okay?

50:02.546 --> 50:05.505
I stashed it till I could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

50:05.586 --> 50:07.905
Good for you. Now,
let's go get it.

50:07.986 --> 50:10.134
But first we gotta get rid
of those cars outside.

50:10.135 --> 50:11.891
It looks like Sam's Hot
Car Lot out there.

50:12.502 --> 50:16.341
Okay, Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

50:16.859 --> 50:19.609
White and Pink, you
take a car each.

50:19.988 --> 50:21.656
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.

50:21.657 --> 50:23.162
Pick up the stones.

50:23.626 --> 50:27.065
While I'm following you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

50:27.146 --> 50:28.825
We can't leave these
guys here with him.

50:29.445 --> 50:32.924
- Why not?
- Cause he's a fuckin' psycho.

50:33.451 --> 50:35.907
And if you think
Joe's pissed off,

50:35.908 --> 50:38.889
that ain't nothing compared to
how pissed off I am at him,

50:38.890 --> 50:41.373
for putting me in the same
room as that bastard.

50:43.106 --> 50:45.465
You see what I've been
putting up with, Eddie?

50:45.546 --> 50:49.825
I fuckin' walked in here, I told
these guys about staying put.

50:50.658 --> 50:54.049
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's sticking it in my face,

50:54.050 --> 50:57.757
calling me a motherfucker, saying
he's gonna blow me away...

50:57.807 --> 51:00.085
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

51:00.149 --> 51:03.348
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shooting spree.

51:04.311 --> 51:06.185
What are you, a fuckin'
silent partner?

51:06.211 --> 51:08.010
Tell him!

51:08.146 --> 51:10.625
He went crazy in the store
but he seems all right now.

51:12.026 --> 51:13.067
This is what he was doing.

51:13.128 --> 51:15.342
Bam! Bam!

51:15.815 --> 51:18.186
Bam! Bam!

51:18.187 --> 51:20.604
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

51:20.868 --> 51:23.987
I told them not to touch the
fuckin' alarm, they did!

51:24.021 --> 51:28.880
If they hadn't have done what I told
them not to do, they'd still be alive.

51:30.160 --> 51:32.029
My fuckin' hero!

51:34.146 --> 51:36.025
Thanks.

51:36.146 --> 51:38.985
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

51:39.308 --> 51:41.427
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

51:44.744 --> 51:47.286
What does it matter who
stays with the cop?

51:47.287 --> 51:49.424
We ain't letting him go,
now he's seen everybody.

51:49.466 --> 51:51.345
I haven't been
lookin' at you guys.

51:51.346 --> 51:53.531
Shut the fuck up, man!

51:53.855 --> 51:57.000
You guys should never have taken him out
of the trunk in the first place.

51:57.001 --> 52:00.825
- We tried to find out if he knew about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

52:00.906 --> 52:02.345
Now, here's the news.

52:02.466 --> 52:05.065
Blondie, you stay here and
take care of these two.

52:06.106 --> 52:10.520
White and Pink, you come with me. 'Cause if Joe
gets here and he sees all these cars parked outside,

52:10.521 --> 52:13.501
I swear to you he's gonna be just as
mad at me as he is at you.

52:13.586 --> 52:15.665
Fine. Let's go!

52:36.532 --> 52:38.491
Alone at last.

52:59.774 --> 53:02.013
Guess what.

53:02.306 --> 53:04.385
I think I'm parked
in the red zone.

53:10.132 --> 53:12.077
Now, where were we?

53:14.287 --> 53:17.538
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

53:17.628 --> 53:18.987
Mm-hm.

53:19.146 --> 53:20.874
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

53:20.887 --> 53:22.625
They don't tell me anything.

53:25.186 --> 53:28.145
Nobody tells me shit. You can
torture me all you want.

53:28.981 --> 53:31.778
Torture you. That's a good...
That's a good idea.

53:31.803 --> 53:33.722
I like that one. Yeah.

53:34.906 --> 53:37.905
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup!

53:40.026 --> 53:41.545
My what?

53:41.587 --> 53:43.066
Your boss.

53:44.186 --> 53:46.225
Excuse me, pal,

53:46.306 --> 53:50.185
one thing I wanna make clear to you.
I don't have a boss.

53:50.266 --> 53:52.145
Nobody tells me what to do.

53:52.937 --> 53:55.745
You understand? You hear what
I said, you son of a bitch?

53:55.866 --> 53:59.105
All right, all right, all right.
You don't have a boss. All right.

54:02.306 --> 54:04.305
Get that fuckin' shit off.

54:12.417 --> 54:14.856
Lookit, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

54:16.903 --> 54:20.062
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know.

54:21.788 --> 54:23.867
But I'm gonna
torture you anyway.

54:26.306 --> 54:27.785
Regardless.

54:27.843 --> 54:29.802
Not to get information.

54:31.906 --> 54:36.305
It's amusing to me
to torture a cop.

54:36.386 --> 54:39.585
You can say anything you want,
cause I've heard it all before.

54:40.866 --> 54:45.145
All you can do is pray
for a quick death...

54:48.094 --> 54:52.333
which... you ain't gonna get.

55:08.186 --> 55:09.865
Ah, God.

55:18.226 --> 55:22.065

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:57.291
Fuck!

01:00:57.318 --> 01:01:00.557
- Hey.
- Ah... shit!

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:04.269
Hey.

01:01:07.066 --> 01:01:09.305
What's your name?

01:01:12.506 --> 01:01:13.785
Marvin.

01:01:15.769 --> 01:01:17.768
Marvin what?

01:01:21.306 --> 01:01:22.825
Marvin Nash.

01:01:29.546 --> 01:01:32.145
Listen to me, Marvin, I'm a...

01:01:34.226 --> 01:01:36.945
Listen to me, Marvin
Nash, I'm a cop.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.705
Yeah, I know.

01:01:43.146 --> 01:01:44.785
You do?

01:01:45.866 --> 01:01:49.225
Yeah. Your name's
Freddy something.

01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:51.886
Newandyke.

01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:55.225
Freddy Newandyke.

01:01:58.902 --> 01:02:04.941
Frankie Ferchetti... he introduced
us about five months ago.

01:02:07.906 --> 01:02:09.665
I don't remember that at all.

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.379
I do.

01:02:16.462 --> 01:02:18.621
Fuck!

01:02:18.732 --> 01:02:20.891
Freddy?

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:24.025
Freddy.

01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:26.025
Freddy?

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:30.945
How do I look?

01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:34.692
What?

01:02:43.306 --> 01:02:45.425
I don't know what to
tell you, Marvin.

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:51.345
That fuck!

01:02:53.044 --> 01:02:56.025
Ah, that sick fuck!

01:02:56.277 --> 01:02:59.156
That fuckin' bastard!

01:03:00.973 --> 01:03:03.052
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

01:03:04.546 --> 01:03:07.385
There's cops waiting to
move in a block away.

01:03:08.527 --> 01:03:10.886
What the fuck are
they waiting for?

01:03:11.769 --> 01:03:17.345
This fuckin' guy slashes my face
and he cuts my fuckin' ear off!

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.705
I'm fuckin' deformed!

01:03:19.786 --> 01:03:21.403
Fuck you!

01:03:21.404 --> 01:03:24.625
Fuck you! I'm
fuckin' dying here!

01:03:24.706 --> 01:03:26.825
I'm fuckin' dying!

01:03:34.946 --> 01:03:38.105
They're not to make a move
till Joe Cabot shows up.

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:41.294
I was sent in to get him.

01:03:42.246 --> 01:03:45.345
All right? Now you heard.

01:03:45.426 --> 01:03:47.008
They said he's on his way.

01:03:47.009 --> 01:03:49.065
Don't pussy out on
me now, Marvin.

01:03:51.275 --> 01:03:53.498
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed until

01:03:53.537 --> 01:03:56.265
Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin'
head through that door.

01:04:17.866 --> 01:04:19.745
Say hello to a
motherfucker who's inside.

01:04:19.866 --> 01:04:23.025
Cabot's doing a job and take a big
fat guess who he wants on the team?

01:04:23.106 --> 01:04:25.505
This better not be some
kind of Freddy joke.

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:29.345
It's no joke. I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.848
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

01:04:39.849 --> 01:04:43.309
He says I should just hang in my
apartment and wait for a phone call.

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:47.339
But after waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin' phone, he calls me last night

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.944
and says Joe's ready, he'll
pick me up in 15 minutes.

01:04:50.092 --> 01:04:53.202
- Who all picked you up?
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.

01:04:53.244 --> 01:04:55.673
- What bar?
- Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

01:04:55.706 --> 01:04:57.305
- Mm-hm.
- We get there

01:04:57.386 --> 01:05:00.425
and I meet Joe and a
guy named Mr. White.

01:05:00.506 --> 01:05:02.385
It's a phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:05.265
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

01:05:06.346 --> 01:05:08.385
Okay, Mr. Orange...

01:05:08.506 --> 01:05:12.145
- you ever seen this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

01:05:12.226 --> 01:05:13.825
Yes, Mr. Orange, Mr. White.

01:05:14.383 --> 01:05:15.788
No, he ain't familiar.

01:05:15.826 --> 01:05:19.425
He's ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

01:05:19.546 --> 01:05:21.705
- Joe knows him real good.
- How can you tell?

01:05:21.887 --> 01:05:24.916
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're real buddies.

01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:26.945
- The two of you talk?
- Who, me and Joe?

01:05:27.784 --> 01:05:29.065
Mr. White.

01:05:29.186 --> 01:05:30.705
- A little.
- About what?

01:05:30.786 --> 01:05:33.345
- The Brewers.
- The Milwaukee Brewers?

01:05:33.426 --> 01:05:35.374
Yeah. Apparently, they
won the night before.

01:05:35.387 --> 01:05:36.512
He made a killing off 'em.

01:05:36.582 --> 01:05:37.371
This is sweet, man.

01:05:37.426 --> 01:05:40.465
If this crook's a Brewers fan, his
ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.269
- Bing!
- I'll bet you everything

01:05:42.316 --> 01:05:44.470
from a diddled-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-l-know,

01:05:44.471 --> 01:05:47.466
that Milwaukee, they got a sheet
on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass.

01:05:47.467 --> 01:05:50.420
So what I want you to do
is to go through the mugs

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:53.389
of all the guys from old Milwaukee
with a history of armed robbery,

01:05:53.439 --> 01:05:55.118
put a name to the face.

01:05:55.466 --> 01:05:57.705
- Nice work.
- Thank you, my man.

01:05:58.506 --> 01:06:00.345
How was Long Beach
Mike's referral?

01:06:00.346 --> 01:06:03.295
Perfecto. He's backing me
up a long fuckin' way.

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:05.934
I told 'em it was Long Beach
Mike I did the poker game with.

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:08.809
When Nice Guy called him to check
it out, he said it was A-OK.

01:06:08.859 --> 01:06:11.966
He said I was a good
thief, I didn't rattle,

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:13.736
I was ready to make a move.

01:06:13.783 --> 01:06:15.205
Do right by him.
He's a good guy.

01:06:15.268 --> 01:06:17.387
I wouldn't be inside
if it wasn't for him.

01:06:17.388 --> 01:06:19.104
No. No, no, no, no.

01:06:19.124 --> 01:06:21.730
Long Beach Mike is not
your fuckin' amigo, man.

01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:25.616
Long Beach Mike is a fuckin' scumbag.
He is selling out his amigos.

01:06:25.986 --> 01:06:28.505
That's what kind of a nice guy
he fuckin' is, all right?

01:06:28.626 --> 01:06:32.479
I'll take care of his fuckin' ass, man, but
you get that lowlife scumbag out of mind

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.612
and you take care of
business, you hear me?

01:06:34.717 --> 01:06:36.396
Gone.

01:06:42.053 --> 01:06:43.772
You use the commode story?

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.865
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene, man. Memorize it.

01:06:49.562 --> 01:06:50.353
A what?

01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:52.833
Look, man, an undercover cop's gotta
be Marlon Brando, right?

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:55.187
To do this job, you
gotta be a great actor.

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:58.601
You gotta be naturalistic. You
gotta be naturalistic as hell.

01:06:58.666 --> 01:07:01.242
Right, because if you ain't a great
actor, you're a bad actor,

01:07:01.243 --> 01:07:03.218
and bad acting is
bullshit in this job.

01:07:04.017 --> 01:07:05.625
What is this?

01:07:05.626 --> 01:07:07.905
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

01:07:09.485 --> 01:07:10.572
What?

01:07:10.573 --> 01:07:14.772
Something funny that happened to you while
you were doing a fuckin' job, man. Damn.

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.860
I gotta memorize all this?

01:07:16.861 --> 01:07:18.849
There's over four fuckin'
pages of this shit!

01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:20.854
Just think about it
like it's a joke, all right?

01:07:21.012 --> 01:07:24.131
You memorize what's important, the
rest you make your own, all right?

01:07:24.462 --> 01:07:27.335
- You can tell a joke, can't you?
- No.

01:07:27.336 --> 01:07:31.345
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles or
some-fucking-body and tell a joke, all right?

01:07:31.426 --> 01:07:34.213
Now the things you gotta
remember are the details.

01:07:34.214 --> 01:07:36.199
It's the details that
sell your story.

01:07:36.233 --> 01:07:39.192
This particular story takes
place in a men's room,

01:07:39.414 --> 01:07:41.973
so you gotta know all the
details about the men's room.

01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:46.025
You gotta know if they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands with.

01:07:46.106 --> 01:07:49.705
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not, man.

01:07:49.771 --> 01:07:51.450
You gotta know if
they got liquid soap

01:07:51.493 --> 01:07:54.772
or that pink granulated powdered shit
they used to use in high school, remember?

01:07:54.986 --> 01:07:56.374
You gotta know if they
got hot water or not.

01:07:56.387 --> 01:07:57.785
If it stinks.

01:07:57.866 --> 01:07:59.585
If some nasty, lowlife,

01:07:59.706 --> 01:08:03.905
scum-ridden motherfucker, man, sprayed
diarrhea all over one of the bowls.

01:08:03.986 --> 01:08:07.585
You gotta know every detail there
is to know about this commode.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:12.385
So, what you gotta do is take all them
details, man, and make them your own.

01:08:12.466 --> 01:08:16.345
And while you're doing that, you gotta
remember that this story is about you,

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:19.625
and how you perceived the
events that went down.

01:08:19.706 --> 01:08:22.477
The only way to do
that, my brother,

01:08:22.478 --> 01:08:27.651
keep saying it and saying it and
saying it and saying it and saying it.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:34.745
This was during the Los
Angeles marijuana drought in 1986.

01:08:35.385 --> 01:08:38.354
I still had a connection,
which was insane, 'cause

01:08:38.742 --> 01:08:41.359
you couldn't get weed any-fucking-where.

01:08:42.572 --> 01:08:48.560
Anyway... I had a connection with this hippy
chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.732
They'd give me a call and
they'd say, "Hey, Freddy..."

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:57.718
They'd
say, "Hey, dude, you getting some?"

01:08:58.245 --> 01:09:00.578
"Can you get some for me too?"
Like, they knew I still smoked,

01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:03.971
so they asked me to buy some for
them when I was buying for me.

01:09:04.124 --> 01:09:05.683
But it got to be...

01:09:06.866 --> 01:09:08.944
Got to be, got to be...

01:09:09.988 --> 01:09:12.825
Got to be... every time
I bought some weed,

01:09:12.906 --> 01:09:15.865
I was buying for four or five
different fuckin' people.

01:09:15.866 --> 01:09:20.301
Finally I said, "Fuck this shit!
I'm making this bitch rich."

01:09:20.337 --> 01:09:23.944
She didn't have to do jack shit. She
never even had to meet these people.

01:09:23.973 --> 01:09:25.732
I was doing all the work.

01:09:26.094 --> 01:09:30.263
But then that got to be a pain in the ass.
People calling me on the phone all the fuckin' time.

01:09:30.264 --> 01:09:33.992
I couldn't even rent a fuckin' tape without
six fuckin' phone calls interrupting me.

01:09:34.024 --> 01:09:37.285
"Hey, when's the next time you're
getting some?" Motherfucker!

01:09:37.286 --> 01:09:40.988
I'm trying to watch The Lost Boys, you know.
"When I get some, I'll let you know."

01:09:41.622 --> 01:09:44.358
Then these rinky-dink
potheads come by.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.944
They're my friends and
everything, but still, you know?

01:09:46.946 --> 01:09:48.921
I got all my shit
laid out in $60 bags.

01:09:48.969 --> 01:09:51.304
They don't want $60 worth.
They want $10 worth.

01:09:51.328 --> 01:09:53.890
Breaking it up is a major
fuckin' pain in the ass.

01:09:53.892 --> 01:09:57.088
I don't even know what
$10 worth looks like.

01:09:57.384 --> 01:09:59.610
This is a very weird situation.

01:10:00.777 --> 01:10:05.256
I don't know if you remember back in
'86, there was a major fuckin' drought.

01:10:05.494 --> 01:10:06.853
Nobody had anything.

01:10:06.996 --> 01:10:10.355
People were living on resin, smoking
the wood in their pipes for months.

01:10:10.356 --> 01:10:12.172
This chick had a bunch,

01:10:12.266 --> 01:10:14.428
and she's begging me to sell it.

01:10:14.429 --> 01:10:17.117
So I told her, I wasn't gonna
be Joe the Pot Man any more,

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:21.156
but I would take a little bit and sell
it to my close, close, close friends.

01:10:21.277 --> 01:10:23.996
She agreed that we'd keep the
same arrangement as before,

01:10:24.022 --> 01:10:27.819
ten percent, free pot for me as long
as I helped her out that weekend.

01:10:27.866 --> 01:10:31.225
She had a brick of weed she was selling,
she didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

01:10:31.306 --> 01:10:35.008
Her brother usually goes with her
but he's in County unexpectedly.

01:10:35.009 --> 01:10:38.077
- What for?
- His traffic ticket's got a warrant.

01:10:38.078 --> 01:10:41.657
They stop him for something, found
warrants on him, took him to County.

01:10:41.756 --> 01:10:44.835
Now, she doesn't wanna walk
around alone with all that weed.

01:10:44.885 --> 01:10:46.364
I don't wanna do this.

01:10:46.399 --> 01:10:48.608
I have a very bad
feeling about it.

01:10:48.746 --> 01:10:51.185
She keeps asking me, keeps
asking me, keeps asking me.

01:10:51.306 --> 01:10:53.465
Finally, I said okay cause
I'm sick of hearing it.

01:10:53.546 --> 01:10:55.366
Now we're picking the guy
up at the train station...

01:10:55.428 --> 01:10:56.037
Wait a minute.

01:10:56.066 --> 01:10:59.065
You go to the station to pick up
the buyer with the weed on you?

01:10:59.186 --> 01:11:01.464
The guy needed it right away.
Don't ask me why.

01:11:01.465 --> 01:11:05.660
Anyway, we get to the train station
and we're waiting for the guy.

01:11:05.813 --> 01:11:09.617
I'm carrying the weed around in one of those
little carry-on bags, I gotta take a piss.

01:11:09.706 --> 01:11:12.625
I tell the connection I'll be right
back, I'm going to the boys' room.

01:11:17.546 --> 01:11:20.585
<i>So I walk in the men's room
and who's standing there?</i>

01:11:22.395 --> 01:11:25.794
<i>Four Los Angeles County
sheriffs and a German shepherd.</i>

01:11:27.786 --> 01:11:28.942
They're waiting for you?

01:11:28.968 --> 01:11:31.343
No, it's just a bunch of cops hanging
out in the men's room talking.

01:11:31.407 --> 01:11:33.591
<i>When I walk through the
door they all stop what</i>

01:11:33.592 --> 01:11:35.785
they were talking about
and they looked at me.

01:11:36.756 --> 01:11:40.625
That's hard, man.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

01:11:40.706 --> 01:11:42.385
The German shepherd
starts barking.

01:11:44.106 --> 01:11:45.825
He's barking at me.

01:11:45.906 --> 01:11:48.345
I mean, it's obvious
he's barking at me.

01:11:49.191 --> 01:11:51.799
Every nerve ending, all my senses,

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.996
blood in my veins, everything
I have is screaming,

01:11:54.039 --> 01:11:57.838
"Take off, man. Just bail. Just
get the fuck out of there!"

01:11:58.075 --> 01:11:59.670
Panic hits me like
a bucket of water.

01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:02.004
First there's the shock of it.
Bam, right in the face.

01:12:02.078 --> 01:12:04.324
I'm just standing there,
drenched in panic,

01:12:04.426 --> 01:12:07.265
and all these sheriffs are looking
at me, and they know, man.

01:12:07.346 --> 01:12:10.865
They can smell it, sure
as that fuckin' dog can.

01:12:10.946 --> 01:12:12.745
They can smell it on me.

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:14.958
Shut up!

01:12:15.978 --> 01:12:18.105
Hey, so, so, anyway...

01:12:18.164 --> 01:12:19.803
I got my gun drawn, right,

01:12:19.828 --> 01:12:25.147
and I got it pointed right at this guy and
I tell him, "Freeze! Don't fuckin' move!"

01:12:25.197 --> 01:12:27.916
And this little idiot's
looking right at me, nodding his head yea,

01:12:27.935 --> 01:12:30.142
and he's saying,
"I know, I know, I know."

01:12:30.161 --> 01:12:33.610
But meanwhile, his right hand is
creeping towards the glove box.

01:12:33.706 --> 01:12:38.702
And I scream at him. I go, "Asshole, I'm
gonna fuckin' blow you away right now!"

01:12:38.703 --> 01:12:40.625
"Put your hands on the dash!"

01:12:40.678 --> 01:12:43.366
And he's still looking
at me, nodding his head,

01:12:43.434 --> 01:12:46.132
you know, "I know, buddy.
I know. I know."

01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:49.885
And meanwhile, you know, his hand
is still going for the glove box.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:55.779
And I said, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face",

01:12:55.923 --> 01:12:58.767
"if you don't put your hands
on the fuckin' dash!"

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:04.237
And then this guy's girlfriend, this
real sexy Oriental bitch, you know,

01:13:04.238 --> 01:13:07.253
she starts screaming at him, "Chuck!
Chuck! What are you doing?"

01:13:07.506 --> 01:13:10.185
"Listen to the officer! Put
your hands on the dash!"

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:13.112
So, you know, then like nothing,
the guy snaps out of it

01:13:13.113 --> 01:13:14.992
and casually puts his
hands on the dash.

01:13:15.112 --> 01:13:18.671
- What was he going for?
- His fuckin' registration.

01:13:20.369 --> 01:13:21.197
You're kidding!

01:13:21.198 --> 01:13:25.208
No, man! Stupid fucking citizen doesn't know
how close he came to getting blown away.

01:13:25.391 --> 01:13:27.470
That close, man.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.517
Bonehead running around the neighborhood.
Police brutality.

01:14:00.617 --> 01:14:02.377
<i>You knew how to
handle that situation.</i>

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:05.345
You shit your pants
and dive in and swim.

01:14:08.109 --> 01:14:10.335
<i>Tell me more about Cabot.</i>

01:14:10.336 --> 01:14:11.855
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:13.871
<i>He's... He's a cool guy.</i>

01:14:13.906 --> 01:14:16.836
<i>I don't know. He's funny.</i>

01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:18.236
He's a funny guy.

01:14:19.029 --> 01:14:21.633
You remember the Fantastic Four?

01:14:22.423 --> 01:14:26.142
Oh, yeah, with that invisible
bitch and "Flame On" and shit.

01:14:27.543 --> 01:14:32.902
The Thing. Motherfucker
looks just like the Thing.

01:14:36.186 --> 01:14:39.686
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey... show time.</i>

01:14:39.687 --> 01:14:42.366
<i>Grab your jacket. I'm
parked outside.</i>

01:14:42.565 --> 01:14:44.324
I'll be right down.

01:14:46.032 --> 01:14:47.291
He'll be right down.

They don't know shit.

01:16:13.706 --> 01:16:15.745
You're not gonna get hurt.

01:16:15.826 --> 01:16:19.945
You're fuckin' Baretta. They believe every
fuckin' word cause you're super cool.

01:16:27.586 --> 01:16:29.185
There goes our boy.

01:16:29.266 --> 01:16:33.745
I swear, the guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar to work undercover.

01:16:33.866 --> 01:16:36.745

Hey, I know what I'm talking about, okay?
Black women ain't the same as white women.

01:16:57.714 --> 01:16:59.313
There's a slight difference.

01:16:59.589 --> 01:17:01.979
Very funny. You
know what I mean.

01:17:02.033 --> 01:17:05.505
What a white bitch will put up with, a black
bitch wouldn't put up with for a minute, man.

01:17:05.586 --> 01:17:08.508
They got a line and if you
cross it, they fuck you up.

01:17:08.509 --> 01:17:11.105
I gotta go along with Pink on that one.
I've seen it happen.

01:17:11.124 --> 01:17:13.740
Okay, Mr. Expert, if this
is such a truism,

01:17:13.826 --> 01:17:18.157
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

01:17:18.158 --> 01:17:20.271
I'll make you a bet
that those same damn

01:17:20.307 --> 01:17:22.265
niggers who are showing
their ass in public,

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:24.825
when their bitches get 'em
home, man, they chill out.

01:17:24.954 --> 01:17:27.993
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah, those guys too.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.319
I'll tell you guys a story.

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:35.025
In one of Daddy's clubs, there's a
black cocktail waitress named Elois.

01:17:35.106 --> 01:17:37.662
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

01:17:37.663 --> 01:17:40.851
E-Lois. We called her Lady E.

01:17:40.946 --> 01:17:44.785
Where was she from? Compton?

01:17:44.866 --> 01:17:46.625
From Ladera Heights.

01:17:46.706 --> 01:17:49.545
Ladera Heights, that's
the black Beverly Hills.

01:17:49.626 --> 01:17:52.265
No, it's not the black Beverly Hills.

01:17:52.346 --> 01:17:54.825
It's the black Palos Verdes.

01:17:54.906 --> 01:18:00.305
Anyway, Lady E, I mean, she
was a man-eater-upper.

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:03.665
Un-fucking-believable. Every
guy who ever, ever laid eyes on her

01:18:03.786 --> 01:18:05.985
had to jack off to
her at least once.

01:18:06.066 --> 01:18:09.665
You know who she looked like?
She looked like Christie Love.

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:11.825
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love!,

01:18:11.906 --> 01:18:14.843
about the black female cop?
She always used to say,

01:18:14.921 --> 01:18:17.160
"You're under arrest, sugar."

01:18:18.586 --> 01:18:20.745
Who was the chick who
played Christie Love?

01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:22.865
- Pam Grier.
- No, it wasn't Pam Grier.

01:18:22.946 --> 01:18:24.665
Pam Grier was the other one.

01:18:24.746 --> 01:18:26.345
Pam Grier did the film.

01:18:27.074 --> 01:18:31.254
Christie Love was like a Pam
Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

01:18:31.313 --> 01:18:33.992
- So who was Christie Love?
- How the fuck should I know?

01:18:34.691 --> 01:18:36.847
Great, now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured!

01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:40.034
Whoever it was, it doesn't matter.
She looked like Elois.

01:18:40.061 --> 01:18:41.305
Anne Francis.

01:18:41.306 --> 01:18:44.137
No, that was Honey West.

01:18:44.231 --> 01:18:47.985
- Anne Francis is white.
- Shut up, all right? I'm trying to tell a story here.

01:18:48.066 --> 01:18:53.527
She looked exactly like Elois. Anyway...
I come into the club one night,

01:18:53.616 --> 01:18:57.495
and there's Carlos, he's the bartender.
He's a wetback. He's a friend of mine.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.373
And I says to him, "Carlos,
where's Lady E tonight?"

01:19:01.374 --> 01:19:05.598
And he... And now, apparently, Lady E was
married to a real piece of dog shit.

01:19:05.906 --> 01:19:08.825
I mean a real fuckin' animal.
He used to do things to her.

01:19:08.906 --> 01:19:11.425
Do things? Do things like what?
What would he do?

01:19:11.506 --> 01:19:13.345
Did he beat her up or something?

01:19:14.098 --> 01:19:16.496
I don't know what he did. He
just did things, all right?

01:19:16.546 --> 01:19:20.225
So, anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

01:19:20.306 --> 01:19:22.756
She waits for this bag
of shit to get drunk,

01:19:22.826 --> 01:19:25.427
he falls asleep on
the fuckin' couch,

01:19:25.506 --> 01:19:30.065
she sneaks up on him, and she puts
some wacko glue on his dick...

01:19:30.146 --> 01:19:32.105
- Ohh!
- And glues his dick to his belly!

01:19:32.287 --> 01:19:35.156
- No!
- Jesus Christ!

01:19:35.157 --> 01:19:38.008
I'm serious, man. I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:41.345
They had to call the paramedics to
cut the prick loose, literally!

01:19:41.466 --> 01:19:44.625
- ...do some crazy things with it.
- Was he all pissed off?

01:19:46.306 --> 01:19:50.905
How would you feel if every time you had to
take a piss you had to do a fuckin' handstand?

01:19:55.746 --> 01:19:59.025
You guys like to tell jokes and
giggle and kid around, huh?

01:19:59.146 --> 01:20:02.265
Giggling like a bunch of young
broads in the school yard.

01:20:02.346 --> 01:20:04.025
Well, let me tell a joke.

01:20:05.106 --> 01:20:09.790
Five guys sitting in a
bullpen in San Quentin

01:20:09.882 --> 01:20:12.767
wondering how the
fuck they got there.

01:20:12.864 --> 01:20:14.852
"What did we do wrong?
What shoulda we done?

01:20:14.896 --> 01:20:16.398
"What didn't we do? What happens now?

01:20:16.429 --> 01:20:19.945
"It's your fault, my fault, his
fault." All that bullshit.

01:20:20.026 --> 01:20:24.185
Finally someone comes up with
the idea, "Wait a minute,

01:20:24.266 --> 01:20:28.745
"while we were planning this caper, all we
did was sit around and tell fuckin' jokes."

01:20:29.255 --> 01:20:31.334
Got the message?

01:20:32.946 --> 01:20:35.105
Fellas, I don't mean
to holler at you.

01:20:36.357 --> 01:20:39.339
When this caper's over, and I'm sure
it's gonna be a successful one,

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:42.851
hell, we'll go down the Hawaiian
islands, I'll roar and laugh with all of you.

01:20:43.066 --> 01:20:45.175
You'll find me a different
character down there.

01:20:45.237 --> 01:20:47.676
Right now, it's a
matter of business.

01:20:48.586 --> 01:20:52.825
With the exception of Eddie and
myself, who you already know,

01:20:52.946 --> 01:20:55.665
we're gonna be using
aliases on this job.

01:20:56.106 --> 01:20:58.371
Under no circumstances

01:20:58.426 --> 01:21:03.905
do I want any one of you to relate to
each other by your Christian names,

01:21:03.986 --> 01:21:08.185
and I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

01:21:08.306 --> 01:21:14.265
That includes where you been, your wife's
name, where you might have done time,

01:21:14.346 --> 01:21:18.185
or a bank that you
robbed in St. Petersburg.

01:21:18.547 --> 01:21:24.186
All I want you guys to talk about if
you have to, is what you're gonna do.

01:21:25.075 --> 01:21:27.394
That should do it.

01:21:27.459 --> 01:21:28.858
Here are your names.

01:21:29.866 --> 01:21:31.225
Mr. Brown,

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.679
Mr. White,

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:34.014
Mr. Blond,

01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:36.562
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange,

01:21:36.633 --> 01:21:39.196
- and Mr. Pink.
- Why am I Mr. Pink?

01:21:39.197 --> 01:21:41.276
Because you're a
faggot, all right?

01:21:43.152 --> 01:21:45.351
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.159
No way. Tried it once,
it doesn't work.

01:21:48.186 --> 01:21:51.705
You get four guys all fighting
over who's gonna be Mr. Black.

01:21:51.786 --> 01:21:55.025
They don't know each other so
nobody wants to back down.

01:21:55.146 --> 01:21:57.425
No way. I pick. You're Mr. Pink.

01:21:58.013 --> 01:22:00.395
Be thankful you're
not Mr. Yellow.

01:22:00.396 --> 01:22:03.271
Yeah, but Mr. Brown, that's a
little too close to Mr. Shit.

01:22:03.466 --> 01:22:05.295
Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy.

01:22:05.367 --> 01:22:09.246
How about if I'm Mr. Purple? That
sounds good to me. I'll be Mr. Purple.

01:22:09.247 --> 01:22:11.705
You're not Mr. Purple.

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:15.985
Some guy on some other job is Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink!

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:18.089
Who cares what your name is?

01:22:18.132 --> 01:22:19.823
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You're Mr. White.

01:22:19.847 --> 01:22:21.785
You have a cool-sounding name.

01:22:21.866 --> 01:22:24.564
All right, look, if it's no big deal
to be Mr. Pink, do you wanna trade?

01:22:24.619 --> 01:22:28.185
Hey, nobody's trading
with anybody.

01:22:28.266 --> 01:22:31.385
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know?

01:22:33.308 --> 01:22:35.387
Now, listen up, Mr. Pink,

01:22:35.406 --> 01:22:37.845
there's two ways you
can go on this job:

01:22:37.887 --> 01:22:40.366
my way or the highway.

01:22:40.386 --> 01:22:42.225
Now, what's it
gonna be, Mr. Pink?

01:22:43.103 --> 01:22:46.158
Jesus Christ, Joe,
fuckin' forget about it.

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:48.874
It's beneath me, you know. I'm Mr. Pink.
Let's move on.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.839
I'll move on when
I feel like it.

01:22:51.908 --> 01:22:54.501
All you guys got the
goddamn message?

01:22:56.595 --> 01:22:59.954
I'm so goddamn mad hollering at
you guys, I can hardly talk.

01:23:01.746 --> 01:23:03.785
Let's go to work.

01:23:04.288 --> 01:23:06.727
<i>Let's go over it. Where are you?</i>

01:23:06.753 --> 01:23:08.316
<i>I stand outside
and guard the door.</i>

01:23:08.347 --> 01:23:10.972
<i>I don't let anybody
go in or go out.</i>

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.494
<i>- Mr. Brown?
- Mr. Brown waits in the car.</i>

01:23:13.565 --> 01:23:16.825
He's parked across the street. When I
signal he pulls up in front of the store.

01:23:17.304 --> 01:23:19.385
Mr. Blond and Mr. Blue?

01:23:19.386 --> 01:23:22.905
Crowd control. They handle
customers and employees.

01:23:22.986 --> 01:23:26.105
- That girl's ass?
- Sitting right here on my dick.

01:23:28.626 --> 01:23:30.545
Myself and Mr. Pink?

01:23:30.626 --> 01:23:34.745
Ah, you two take the manager in the back
and make him give you the diamonds.

01:23:34.866 --> 01:23:36.985
We're there for those
stones, period.

01:23:37.066 --> 01:23:41.665
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

01:23:41.746 --> 01:23:44.465
We're out of there in two minutes.
Not one second longer.

01:23:46.106 --> 01:23:49.945
What happens if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:53.385
When you're dealing with a store like
this, they're insured up the ass.

01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:56.427
They're not supposed to give
you any resistance whatsoever.

01:23:56.466 --> 01:24:00.305
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson,

01:24:00.386 --> 01:24:02.665
take the butt of your gun
and smash their nose in.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:05.545
It drops them right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

01:24:05.626 --> 01:24:08.345
He falls down screaming, blood
squirts out of his nose.

01:24:08.426 --> 01:24:12.385
Freaks everybody out. Nobody
says fuckin' shit after that.

01:24:12.466 --> 01:24:14.865
You might get some bitch
talk shit to you,

01:24:14.986 --> 01:24:17.585
but give her a look like you're
gonna smash her face next.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:20.145
Watch her shut the fuck up.

01:24:20.226 --> 01:24:22.385
Now if it's a manager,
that's a different story.

01:24:22.825 --> 01:24:25.210
The managers know better
than to fuck around.

01:24:25.266 --> 01:24:27.174
So, if you get one that's
giving you static,

01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:29.147
he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy,

01:24:29.186 --> 01:24:31.385
so you got to break that
son of a bitch in two.

01:24:31.959 --> 01:24:35.832
If you wanna know something and he won't
tell you, cut off one of his fingers.

01:24:35.906 --> 01:24:39.232
The little one. Then tell
him his thumb's next.

01:24:39.263 --> 01:24:42.742
After that he'll tell you if
he wears ladies' underwear.

01:24:46.386 --> 01:24:48.625
I'm hungry. Let's get a taco.

01:25:00.329 --> 01:25:01.848
Come on!

01:25:04.106 --> 01:25:06.425
Fuck!

01:25:16.066 --> 01:25:17.865
Fuck!

01:25:23.346 --> 01:25:26.185
Jesus! I got blinded, man.

01:25:26.290 --> 01:25:27.453
I'm fuckin' blind.

01:25:27.515 --> 01:25:30.101
You're not blind. You just got
blood in your eyes, all right?

01:25:43.954 --> 01:25:45.313
Is he dead?

01:25:45.746 --> 01:25:48.825
Did he die or not?

01:25:48.906 --> 01:25:50.545
Let's go.

01:26:24.955 --> 01:26:27.580
Hold it! Hold it! Right there!

01:26:29.186 --> 01:26:31.825
Get out of the fuckin' car!

01:26:46.506 --> 01:26:48.825
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Larry.

01:26:48.906 --> 01:26:51.385
I... I can't believe
she killed me.

01:26:51.466 --> 01:26:53.185
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

01:26:53.306 --> 01:26:55.745
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now.

01:26:55.826 --> 01:26:58.825
You're hurt. You're
hurt real fuckin' bad,

01:26:58.946 --> 01:27:00.425
but you ain't dying.

01:27:01.146 --> 01:27:01.974
Ohh!

01:27:02.026 --> 01:27:05.345
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

01:27:05.426 --> 01:27:08.265
I... I'm gonna die, I know it.

01:27:43.632 --> 01:27:44.593
What the fuck happened?

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.515
He slashed the cop's face, cut off his
ear and was gonna burn him alive.

01:27:49.981 --> 01:27:52.020
What? I didn't hear you.

01:27:52.257 --> 01:27:54.016
I said...

01:27:55.706 --> 01:27:57.185
Blond went crazy.

01:27:57.266 --> 01:28:01.705
He slashed the cop's face, cut off his
ear and was gonna burn him alive.

01:28:02.746 --> 01:28:04.385
This cop?

01:28:06.168 --> 01:28:07.418
No...

01:28:08.866 --> 01:28:13.105
He went crazy, something like that?
Worse or better?

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:17.127
Eddie, he was pulling
a burn, man.

01:28:17.746 --> 01:28:19.625
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

01:28:19.706 --> 01:28:21.625
When you guys walked
through the door,

01:28:21.706 --> 01:28:24.465
he was gonna blow you to hell
and make off with the diamonds.

01:28:24.546 --> 01:28:29.025
What'd I tell you? That sick piece
of shit was a stone-cold psycho.

01:28:29.106 --> 01:28:32.465
You could've asked the cop,
if you didn't just kill him.

01:28:32.546 --> 01:28:36.585
He talked about what he was gonna
do when he was slicing him up.

01:28:37.666 --> 01:28:39.270
I don't buy it.

01:28:39.301 --> 01:28:40.780
Doesn't make sense.

01:28:45.266 --> 01:28:47.105
Makes perfect fuckin'
sense to me.

01:28:47.645 --> 01:28:51.395
You weren't there during the job, buddy.
You didn't see how he acted. We did.

01:28:51.396 --> 01:28:53.333
He's right about the
ear, it's hacked off.

01:28:53.334 --> 01:28:57.951
All right, let me just say this out loud,
cause I wanna get this straight in my head.

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:01.777
You're saying that Mr.
Blond was gonna kill you,

01:29:01.826 --> 01:29:05.145
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us,

01:29:05.226 --> 01:29:07.185
take the satchel of
diamonds and scram.

01:29:07.266 --> 01:29:10.345
I'm right about that, right,
that's correct, that's your story?

01:29:10.981 --> 01:29:15.180
I swear on my mother's eternal
soul, it's what happened.

01:29:15.699 --> 01:29:18.667
The man you just killed just
got released from prison.

01:29:18.706 --> 01:29:21.785
He got caught at a company
warehouse full of hot items.

01:29:21.866 --> 01:29:23.585
He could've fuckin' walked.

01:29:24.586 --> 01:29:28.705
All he had to do was say my dad's name, but
he didn't, he kept his fuckin' mouth shut,

01:29:29.028 --> 01:29:34.427
and he did his fuckin' time and he did
it like a man. He did four years for us.

01:29:34.517 --> 01:29:36.836
So, Mr. Orange...

01:29:36.877 --> 01:29:39.883
you're telling me that this
very good friend of mine,

01:29:39.946 --> 01:29:42.705
who did four years
for my father,

01:29:42.786 --> 01:29:47.665
who, in four years, never made a deal, no
matter what they dangled in front of him...

01:29:47.746 --> 01:29:50.745
you're telling me that now
that this man is free,

01:29:50.866 --> 01:29:53.825
and we're making good on
our commitment to him,

01:29:53.946 --> 01:30:00.425
he's just gonna decide, out of the
fuckin' blue... to rip us off?

01:30:02.266 --> 01:30:05.494
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:08.004
What the hell for?

01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:10.529
It'd just be more bullshit.

01:30:12.826 --> 01:30:14.505
This man set us up.

01:30:15.746 --> 01:30:18.745
Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't
know what the hell's happening.

01:30:18.826 --> 01:30:20.305
It's all right, Eddie, I do.

01:30:21.073 --> 01:30:23.201
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:30:23.268 --> 01:30:26.867
That lump of shit's
workin' with the LAPD.

01:30:27.746 --> 01:30:32.545
I don't have the slightest fuckin'
idea what you're talking about.

01:30:32.626 --> 01:30:36.609
Joe, Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

01:30:36.633 --> 01:30:37.695
Like hell I am.

01:30:37.768 --> 01:30:40.687
Joe, trust me on this,
you've made a mistake.

01:30:41.316 --> 01:30:43.155
He's a good kid.

01:30:43.187 --> 01:30:45.665
I understand you're out!
You're super-fuckin'-pissed.

01:30:45.746 --> 01:30:47.505
We're all real emotional.

01:30:47.539 --> 01:30:50.257
But you're barking
up the wrong tree.

01:30:50.283 --> 01:30:52.163
I know this man, he
wouldn't do that.

01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.799
You don't know jack shit! I do.

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:56.665
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops,

01:30:56.746 --> 01:30:58.825
and got Mr. Brown and
Mr. Blue killed.

01:30:59.358 --> 01:31:00.616
Mr. Blue is dead?

01:31:00.661 --> 01:31:02.060
Dead as Dillinger.

01:31:02.438 --> 01:31:04.437
How do you know all this?

01:31:04.479 --> 01:31:07.118
He was the only one I
wasn't 100 percent on.

01:31:07.786 --> 01:31:10.866
I should have my fuckin' head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

01:31:10.898 --> 01:31:12.335
That's your proof?

01:31:12.336 --> 01:31:14.757
You don't need proof
when you have instinct!

01:31:14.786 --> 01:31:17.656
I ignored it before,
but no more.

01:31:19.538 --> 01:31:21.520
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

01:31:21.521 --> 01:31:24.421
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake.
I'm not gonna let you make it.

01:31:24.488 --> 01:31:27.671
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

01:31:27.722 --> 01:31:30.281
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

01:31:30.502 --> 01:31:31.885
Larry, look,

01:31:32.506 --> 01:31:34.305
it's been quite a long time.

01:31:34.558 --> 01:31:35.997
A lot of jobs.

01:31:36.367 --> 01:31:38.446
There's no need for this, man.

01:31:39.066 --> 01:31:41.545
Let's just put our guns down...

01:31:42.786 --> 01:31:46.065
and let's settle this with
a fuckin' conversation.

01:31:46.186 --> 01:31:49.785
Joe, if you kill that
man, you die next.

01:31:49.906 --> 01:31:51.865
Repeat: if you kill
that man, you die next.

01:31:51.986 --> 01:31:54.585
Larry, we have been friends...

01:31:55.626 --> 01:31:59.745
and you respect my dad and I respect you,
but I will put fuckin' bullets through your heart.

01:31:59.866 --> 01:32:01.865
You put that fuckin'
gun down now!

01:32:02.633 --> 01:32:04.872
God damn you, Joe...

01:32:05.266 --> 01:32:06.424
don't make me do this.

01:32:06.425 --> 01:32:09.422
Larry, stop pointin' that
fuckin' gun at my dad!

01:33:56.106 --> 01:33:58.065
I'm sorry, kid.

01:34:00.386 --> 01:34:02.785
Looks like we're gonna...

01:34:02.906 --> 01:34:05.825
do... do a little time.

01:34:12.106 --> 01:34:13.585
I'm a cop.

01:34:15.946 --> 01:34:17.465
Larry...

01:34:19.226 --> 01:34:20.905
I'm sorry.

01:34:22.150 --> 01:34:23.749
I'm...

01:34:24.026 --> 01:34:26.265
so... sorry.

01:34:29.106 --> 01:34:30.705
I'm a cop.

01:34:37.106 --> 01:34:38.545
I'm sorry.

01:34:39.026 --> 01:34:41.865
Oh! Oh!

01:34:47.626 --> 01:34:49.465
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:35:00.826 --> 01:35:02.665
I'm sorry.

01:35:04.737 --> 01:35:07.862
I'm... sorry...

01:35:08.972 --> 01:35:10.456
Larry, I'm sorry.

01:35:10.586 --> 01:35:13.785
Freeze! Drop the
fuckin' gun, buddy!

01:35:13.866 --> 01:35:15.585
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

01:35:15.666 --> 01:35:17.425
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

01:35:17.498 --> 01:35:18.733
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun.

01:35:18.759 --> 01:35:19.842
Drop the fuckin' gun!

01:35:19.946 --> 01:35:21.665
We're gonna fuckin' blow you away!
