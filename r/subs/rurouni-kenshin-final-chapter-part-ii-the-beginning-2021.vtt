WEBVTT

00:32.782 --> 00:37.245
1864

00:37.328 --> 00:40.415
With Japan now open to foreign trade,

00:40.498 --> 00:45.336
some seek to end the Shogun's rule

00:45.420 --> 00:48.965
and restore the Emperor's authority.

00:49.048 --> 00:52.051
Ambitions swirl together with ideals.

00:52.135 --> 00:56.264
Opposing factions face each other.

00:56.347 --> 01:00.018
Fighting spreads through the land.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.106
Trouble!

01:07.067 --> 01:08.485
There's trouble!

01:10.111 --> 01:11.738
Damn!

01:17.077 --> 01:18.995
There's trouble!

01:22.707 --> 01:25.835
KYOTO
TSUSHIMA DOMAIN RESIDENCE

01:25.919 --> 01:28.880
Open the gate! It's Hirata!

01:29.464 --> 01:30.632
Quick!

01:41.768 --> 01:44.020
So you made it, Hirata?

01:44.771 --> 01:47.690
We're having a hard time
making this man talk.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.908
Was it him?

01:58.618 --> 02:03.289
The one who attacked our men
and cut off your arm?

02:04.207 --> 02:06.084
It was dark.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.295
Where did you find him?

02:10.004 --> 02:13.091
He was wandering around
outside last night.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.718
Then it's not him.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.640
That guy had a nasty look.
A very dangerous character.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.435
He'd have been harder to take.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.439
I bear you no ill…

02:30.900 --> 02:32.861
but for the new age…

02:34.320 --> 02:35.446
What?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.410
You must all die.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.620
No!

02:51.129 --> 02:55.008
My ear!

03:01.514 --> 03:03.391
Someone!

03:05.059 --> 03:07.353
Help!

03:07.437 --> 03:09.647
Get him!

03:13.359 --> 03:15.403
Anyone! Help!

03:16.154 --> 03:17.947
It hurts.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.407
A demon!

03:19.991 --> 03:22.118
It's a demon!

04:29.644 --> 04:31.145
Damn you!

04:35.858 --> 04:37.986
You bastard! Who are you?

05:46.596 --> 05:47.430
Soji…

05:48.431 --> 05:50.933
The pro-shogun Tsushimas are dead.

05:52.894 --> 05:57.148
Meaning now the Tsushimas
are anti-shogun, Mr. Kondo?

06:07.366 --> 06:09.869
Lord Katsui!

06:13.206 --> 06:14.874
Describe the man.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.294
All these men, in a flash.

06:19.253 --> 06:24.342
You don't need to ask, Mr. Saito.
It was Battosai the Killer.

06:25.635 --> 06:29.639
Cold-blooded, emotionless.
A killing machine.

06:43.152 --> 06:47.824
Can you believe this guy
is getting married in these crazy times?

06:48.783 --> 06:50.159
Sorry!

06:50.243 --> 06:52.078
Oh, why not?

06:52.161 --> 06:54.038
He's a happy guy.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.290
I'm jealous.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.966
APRIL 5TH, KYOTO

07:05.049 --> 07:05.883
SHIGEKURA DOMAIN RESIDENCE

07:05.967 --> 07:07.468
Who's there?

07:08.052 --> 07:10.930
Inspector Jubei Shigekura, I assume?

07:11.013 --> 07:13.891
Who's there? State your name!

07:16.853 --> 07:19.439
-Hey!
-You're Battosai?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.237
Bastard!

07:34.162 --> 07:35.913
You Choshu rebel!

08:00.688 --> 08:03.316
I don't want to die.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.408
I can't die now. I can't.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.291
There's someone I care for.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.377
I can't die now!

08:37.975 --> 08:41.020
I can't die now!

08:41.103 --> 08:44.357
There's someone I love!

08:46.317 --> 08:47.985
I don't want to die!

09:16.514 --> 09:18.182
I can't die!

09:19.642 --> 09:21.227
I can't…

09:26.857 --> 09:28.734
There's someone I love.

10:23.122 --> 10:27.001
JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION

10:50.733 --> 10:54.153
KOHAGIYA INN

11:23.766 --> 11:28.771
There are still lots of shogunate men,
even without the Tsushimas.

11:28.854 --> 11:33.109
It'll be a while before we Choshu men
can show our faces again.

11:33.901 --> 11:37.029
But one day we will rule.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.809
With swords in hand…

12:06.892 --> 12:09.603
we'll show them who's loyal!

12:09.687 --> 12:11.105
Yes!

12:11.188 --> 12:13.899
But we have to be careful!

12:13.983 --> 12:17.820
We'll take back what we've lost!

12:17.903 --> 12:19.238
Step back!

12:20.030 --> 12:22.950
-Stop Aizu and Satsuma!
-We can't accept this!

12:23.033 --> 12:26.287
-The Emperor will listen!
-That's right!

12:31.667 --> 12:33.127
What's all this noise?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.587
Quiet down!

12:37.047 --> 12:38.549
Here he is.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.180
Been a while, Himura.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.600
What's that cut?

12:48.559 --> 12:50.853
A Shigekura man.

12:50.936 --> 12:51.854
I see.

12:52.855 --> 12:57.026
He must have been good
to score a hit on you.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.195
Not so much that.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.032
He had a strong will to live.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.537
After all the men you've killed,
you're still not used to it?

13:11.499 --> 13:15.252
Why did you call me here, Mr. Katsura?

13:15.836 --> 13:16.754
Hey!

13:17.796 --> 13:20.174
How dare you take that tone!

13:20.257 --> 13:22.968
I've killed a hundred in six months.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.056
I can hide, but one day
the shogun's men will find me.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.976
I shouldn't be seen around here.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.731
Then I'll make it short.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.986
The shogunate forces
grow stronger by the day.

13:42.071 --> 13:46.367
Especially the "Wolves of Mibu."

13:47.952 --> 13:50.746
The Shinsengumi police?

13:51.997 --> 13:56.377
They're probably the best men
the shogunate has.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.299
Be very careful.

14:03.342 --> 14:07.763
For them, Battosai the Killer
is their biggest threat.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.015
They'll try anything.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.893
I understand.

14:15.896 --> 14:16.814
This is…

14:18.148 --> 14:21.735
Furutaka of the Masuya.
He does a lot for us.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.279
At your service.

14:30.411 --> 14:34.039
Leaving already?

14:40.880 --> 14:45.092
You're probably thinking,
this isn't the time for women.

14:48.804 --> 14:53.142
Our movement exists so that
a girl like this can be happy.

15:05.696 --> 15:10.075
That samurai looked so sad…

15:11.660 --> 15:13.537
I've known him for a year.

15:14.413 --> 15:19.543
He acts all grown up,
but he hasn't changed a bit.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.266
Status means nothing here.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.225
1 YEAR EARLIER
AMIDAIJI TEMPLE, CHOSHU

15:35.309 --> 15:41.148
What matters is skill with a sword.
Anyone who has that is welcome.

15:41.732 --> 15:45.235
Our strike force depends on
the element of surprise.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.491
DON'T FEAR TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH

15:52.034 --> 15:53.118
Strike!

16:06.048 --> 16:06.882
Hey, you.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.052
Why do you want to join?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.223
To overthrow the Shogun.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.767
Are you some peasant's son?

16:16.850 --> 16:20.062
"Skill with a sword," the man said.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.522
Was he lying?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.232
What did you say?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.025
Then fight me.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.947
Let's start by seeing how good you are.

16:38.455 --> 16:42.042
I don't want to hurt someone
I'll be fighting together with.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.127
What did you say?

16:44.211 --> 16:45.254
Don't worry.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.510
Once he's drawn, he's ready for that.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.849
Show us what you've got.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.057
As you were.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.726
-Back to work!
-Resume!

17:40.809 --> 17:42.519
-Now!
-Hurry!

17:44.146 --> 17:45.856
The quick draw.

17:46.648 --> 17:49.651
But in a style I've never seen.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.572
What's it called?

17:54.823 --> 17:56.450
Hiten Mitsurugi-ryu.

18:07.086 --> 18:11.632
Have you ever killed someone?

18:15.803 --> 18:16.970
No.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.474
Do you think you could?

18:27.815 --> 18:30.359
If beyond the lives lost…

18:32.653 --> 18:36.657
lay a new age
where all lived in peace of mind.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.508
Drink!

18:56.885 --> 18:58.971
Here. Sit here.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.144
Hiten Mitsurugi-ryu.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.814
I'd heard of it…

19:09.398 --> 19:11.650
but I didn't believe it.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.912
Shinsaku…

19:25.289 --> 19:26.915
I want that man.

19:29.001 --> 19:33.922
If you want assassins,
why not be one yourself?

19:36.842 --> 19:40.512
You're the portable shrine
of our anti-shogun movement.

19:41.388 --> 19:46.768
I guess no one will carry it for us
if it's covered in blood.

19:51.899 --> 19:52.858
But…

19:54.651 --> 19:57.779
you're going to ruin that kid's life.

19:58.947 --> 20:03.827
Just make sure you keep yourself clean
right to the very end.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.589
You don't think I know that?

20:35.108 --> 20:42.032
With all the men he's killed,
he's still completely pure at heart.

20:44.993 --> 20:45.911
But…

20:48.580 --> 20:53.627
that's all the more reason
that killing is making him feel…

20:55.128 --> 20:56.755
uneasy.

20:58.215 --> 21:03.679
NAGURA TAVERN

21:03.762 --> 21:05.555
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

21:05.639 --> 21:07.432
-One more.
-Okay!

21:23.490 --> 21:25.325
<i>I can't die!</i>

21:27.327 --> 21:29.246
There's someone I love!

21:43.635 --> 21:44.970
Good evening.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.723
What can I get you?

21:47.806 --> 21:50.225
-A cold sake, please.
-Okay.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.061
This looks like fun.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.354
She's gorgeous.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.522
Yeah!

21:55.605 --> 21:57.065
And alone.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.483
I've never seen her before.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.952
Here you go.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.762
-Old man!
-Yes?

22:26.845 --> 22:28.055
Another!

22:28.555 --> 22:29.389
Okay.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.898
Woman…

22:39.149 --> 22:41.318
Pour us a drink.

22:41.401 --> 22:45.238
We're Emperor loyalists
from the Aizu Domain.

22:46.364 --> 22:51.578
We're out day and night
risking our lives for the likes of you.

22:52.621 --> 22:57.292
You owe us, you know.
You should be nice to us.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.378
Aizu's pro-shogun, stupid!

23:01.922 --> 23:03.340
What did you say?

23:08.011 --> 23:12.099
That's better. Just keep your mouths shut.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.229
That was close.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.231
It sure was.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.148
What?

23:20.732 --> 23:23.568
I was about to draw on you.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.697
What?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.496
Take my advice.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.833
Things are going to get worse.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.003
Kyoto's no place for fake patriots.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.801
If you value your lives,
go back to your village.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.776
What a pathetic pair!

24:05.569 --> 24:07.195
Fake patriots!

24:12.951 --> 24:16.204
I'll have my bill.
Sorry about the trouble.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.081
Okay.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.297
You're really going to kill him?

24:25.380 --> 24:29.009
Damn right! Nobody makes a fool of me.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.218
Here he comes!

24:45.859 --> 24:47.319
I would run if I were you.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.158
Hey!

24:53.241 --> 24:54.117
I don't run.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.087
Battosai, huh?

25:08.298 --> 25:09.633
You're mine!

25:52.175 --> 25:54.886
I thought I'd come out and say thank you.

25:58.223 --> 26:03.436
A rain of blood
is a cliché in tragic plays.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.233
But you really…

26:10.193 --> 26:12.070
make it rain blood.

26:33.675 --> 26:37.595
KOHAGIYA INN

26:55.530 --> 26:57.240
Thank you.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.700
Not at all.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.371
You Choshu men seem busy.

28:07.852 --> 28:12.273
Mr. Himura,
this isn't a brothel, you know.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.903
But I'll admit she works hard.

28:19.989 --> 28:20.824
Hey…

28:24.327 --> 28:25.412
You're better now?

28:27.247 --> 28:30.500
Thank you. I'm sorry about last night.

28:31.334 --> 28:34.045
It seems you looked after me.

28:37.006 --> 28:37.841
Hey…

28:45.557 --> 28:46.725
Your name?

28:48.476 --> 28:49.310
Tomoe.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.439
Tomoe Yukishiro.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.192
What are you doing here?

28:57.944 --> 29:00.864
As you can see,
I'm helping in the kitchen.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.582
Coming right up.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.299
You're looking cheerful today.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.971
How do you do? My name is Tomoe.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.098
I'll be working here.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.858
She's Himura's?

29:37.358 --> 29:40.653
I guess there's more to him
than meets the eye.

29:42.572 --> 29:43.698
Can I have more?

29:43.782 --> 29:44.908
Me too.

29:46.910 --> 29:50.205
She’s no friendlier than he is!

29:50.288 --> 29:51.206
Settle down.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.251
Me too.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.753
I'll have some too.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.338
I'm first.

29:58.421 --> 29:59.798
This is good!

30:07.013 --> 30:08.932
Is something wrong?

30:14.229 --> 30:16.105
You're a problem.

30:17.190 --> 30:20.568
Please forget
what you saw last night and leave.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.031
Is me being here a problem?

30:26.115 --> 30:28.284
Your family will be worried.

30:30.620 --> 30:35.291
If I had a family to go back to,
I wouldn't have been drinking alone.

30:38.628 --> 30:43.967
I don't know your story, but right now
we can't really have you here.

30:44.050 --> 30:49.472
Then will you kill me? Like you did
that samurai in black last night?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.689
Think whatever you want about me.

30:58.773 --> 31:02.777
But I kill to bring about
a new age of peace.

31:03.611 --> 31:05.780
I don't kill just anybody.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.075
Only the shogun's swordsmen.

31:10.660 --> 31:14.789
I don't kill townsfolk
or anyone with no sword.

31:19.294 --> 31:25.842
So killing depends only on
whether or not they have a sword?

31:28.386 --> 31:32.348
If I drew a sword right now,

31:33.600 --> 31:35.143
would you kill me?

31:39.814 --> 31:41.190
Well…

31:45.445 --> 31:50.199
When you find the answer to that,
come and tell me.

32:36.579 --> 32:39.582
<i>I heard you were attacked.</i>

32:40.166 --> 32:41.417
An ambush.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.086
Shinsengumi?

32:43.169 --> 32:44.128
No.

32:44.712 --> 32:49.384
Someone underground, like me,
who'd kill any way he could.

32:50.885 --> 32:54.722
A secret agent of theirs? Or perhaps…

33:00.812 --> 33:03.690
Only a few of us know about Himura.

33:04.273 --> 33:06.484
But he was ambushed.

33:07.068 --> 33:11.489
You mean to say
we have a traitor in our midst?

35:30.419 --> 35:31.879
You're still up?

35:37.385 --> 35:41.806
When you go out at night, I can't sleep.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.562
Don't get involved with me.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.364
For the blood.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.303
Do you intend…

36:22.847 --> 36:25.057
to go on killing forever?

37:05.431 --> 37:06.557
Thank you.

37:08.142 --> 37:11.938
-Help with the firewood, will you?
-Yes, ma'am.

37:15.524 --> 37:16.984
Over there.

37:27.161 --> 37:28.871
Careful, it's heavy.

37:48.391 --> 37:53.896
-Those men get their clothes so dirty!
-Right.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.064
We can't keep up!

37:58.150 --> 38:01.070
-Here we go.
-Take those too.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.739
Thanks, Tomoe.

38:03.823 --> 38:04.991
Thank you.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.499
Tomoe…

38:57.668 --> 39:00.463
Thanks a lot.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.480
Don't leave any.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.192
She's like a wife!

39:21.275 --> 39:23.402
They suit each other!

39:24.779 --> 39:26.822
The perfect pair!

39:29.158 --> 39:32.161
That woman never smiles.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.955
She's a strange one.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.211
Give me some tea.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.817
Really? With Himura?

40:06.445 --> 40:10.282
Are you sure she's not a spy?

40:11.409 --> 40:12.660
I don't know.

40:14.161 --> 40:20.960
Himura said she saw him kill,
so he had to keep her close.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.545
Where's she from?

40:23.170 --> 40:27.216
From her accent and bearing,
she's obviously not from Kyoto.

40:27.299 --> 40:30.928
She can read and write, so she's probably
the daughter of a samurai.

40:31.595 --> 40:36.851
Maybe a poor samurai's daughter
had to work as a whore.

40:37.643 --> 40:41.021
There's been no sign of her
trying to contact anyone.

40:41.772 --> 40:45.818
The only thing that worries me
is how Himura looks now.

40:46.318 --> 40:49.905
Himura, about tonight…

40:53.701 --> 40:55.828
Mr. Himura is asleep.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.293
<i>Asleep?</i>

41:03.002 --> 41:04.336
In plain view?

41:08.007 --> 41:11.385
I guess maybe he's mellowing.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.267
Tell Battosai…

41:18.934 --> 41:22.605
to cut down anyone
standing in the way of the new age.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.440
He can come to me for swords.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.817
I'll make all he wants.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.452
My swords will change history.

42:13.364 --> 42:19.370
Excuse the late hour.
May I come in for a minute?

42:20.788 --> 42:22.873
Mr. Himura goes out at night.

42:22.957 --> 42:24.208
I know.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.633
Do you have some business with me?

42:35.427 --> 42:37.012
There's something…

42:39.431 --> 42:41.559
I'd like you to know.

42:45.104 --> 42:49.692
"Gentlemen, go mad."

42:50.568 --> 42:56.115
Our mentor Shoin Yoshida said this to us
just before he was beheaded.

42:58.659 --> 43:04.164
We must go mad to end the rot
of a 300-year-old shogunate.

43:04.248 --> 43:10.462
And as the spearpoint of mad justice
that will bring this about…

43:11.714 --> 43:15.634
Himura has the harshest role to play.

43:29.565 --> 43:34.695
Please do nothing to blunt his sword.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.248
May I come in?

44:31.710 --> 44:33.962
Mr. Katsura left this for you.

45:01.407 --> 45:02.825
Do me a favor.

45:07.329 --> 45:09.373
Come out with me.

45:34.731 --> 45:36.191
Isn't he cute?

45:39.319 --> 45:43.073
His parents must be so proud
he was chosen for that role.

45:45.659 --> 45:50.122
Will he make a wrong move? Will he fall?

45:53.375 --> 45:56.587
I'm sure they're here watching,
feeling very nervous.

46:01.216 --> 46:05.596
Everyone here is someone's child.

46:07.139 --> 46:12.102
Everyone here has someone they love.

46:14.313 --> 46:19.818
And they all take it for granted
that their lives together…

46:21.111 --> 46:23.363
will go on and on.

46:29.453 --> 46:32.206
Is there really such a thing as…

46:34.291 --> 46:36.001
fighting for peace?

46:39.213 --> 46:40.797
If it's for us all,

46:42.799 --> 46:44.676
do ideals mean…

46:47.721 --> 46:50.265
that little things…

46:52.935 --> 46:55.562
must fall victim?

47:00.150 --> 47:01.568
And aren't you…

47:03.862 --> 47:06.031
a victim too?

47:14.081 --> 47:16.041
With a sword…

47:20.504 --> 47:22.714
that boy cuts the rope…

47:24.049 --> 47:26.468
dividing this world from the next.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.264
Only then does the parade begin.

47:34.643 --> 47:38.480
For times to change,
someone must use a sword.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.568
That just happens to be me.

48:03.880 --> 48:08.176
SHINSENGUMI HEADQUARTERS

48:18.604 --> 48:20.647
You piece of crap!

48:25.235 --> 48:26.486
Saito.

48:29.448 --> 48:30.490
Look.

48:34.202 --> 48:38.373
Everything else was burned,
but we found that in a shed.

48:39.416 --> 48:44.588
When the wind rises on Festival Eve,
they plan to burn the palace…

48:45.505 --> 48:48.342
and take the Emperor to Choshu.

48:51.303 --> 48:54.640
We'll look good if we can stop it.

48:56.016 --> 49:00.687
And we'll pay them back for
what they did to the Tsushimas.

49:12.699 --> 49:15.452
<i>Is there really such a thing as…</i>

49:16.370 --> 49:17.746
<i>fighting for peace?</i>

49:19.623 --> 49:21.124
<i>If it's for us all,</i>

49:22.459 --> 49:24.127
<i>do ideals mean…</i>

49:25.712 --> 49:28.632
that little things…

49:30.050 --> 49:32.260
<i>must fall victim?</i>

49:37.349 --> 49:40.936
<i>Kanryusai Takeda, Shinpachi Nagakura,</i>

49:41.728 --> 49:44.398
Heisuke Todo, and Soji.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.943
You ten form the Commander's unit.

49:48.777 --> 49:51.071
The rest will follow me.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.156
Mr. Kondo.

49:56.952 --> 50:01.915
Based on our inspectors' evidence,
we will search inns in Kawaramachi.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.711
Detain any Choshu men you find.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.171
If they resist…

50:10.173 --> 50:11.383
kill them.

50:14.052 --> 50:15.846
Follow the Commander!

50:17.681 --> 50:18.682
Let's go!

50:19.391 --> 50:21.101
Inoue squad!

50:26.022 --> 50:27.065
Himura!

50:29.317 --> 50:30.485
It's Mr. Katsura!

50:31.570 --> 50:32.904
What's wrong?

50:32.988 --> 50:38.160
The Shinsengumi arrested
our agent, Furutaka!

50:38.243 --> 50:39.661
At your service.

50:41.496 --> 50:44.958
The patriots have a plot
that happens tonight.

50:45.041 --> 50:47.544
They'll set fire to the palace,

50:47.627 --> 50:51.465
kidnap the Emperor,
and take him to Choshu.

50:52.507 --> 50:55.302
Mr. Katsura wants to stop them.

50:55.385 --> 50:56.428
Where are they?

50:56.511 --> 50:58.722
At the Ikedaya Inn.

51:00.432 --> 51:05.812
If Furutaka talked, the shogun's men
would get Mr. Katsura along with them!

51:45.185 --> 51:46.853
Where's the owner?

51:47.938 --> 51:52.067
IKEDAYA INN

51:57.489 --> 51:58.406
Yes?

51:58.490 --> 51:59.866
Police!

52:02.619 --> 52:04.162
Everyone upstairs!

52:04.246 --> 52:06.414
It's a raid! Go!

52:11.586 --> 52:12.754
Police!

52:18.677 --> 52:19.886
Kondo!

52:20.470 --> 52:21.596
Run!

52:22.681 --> 52:23.765
Get them!

52:32.649 --> 52:33.483
Go!

52:40.532 --> 52:42.284
Get them all!

53:12.772 --> 53:14.524
Run!

53:14.608 --> 53:17.277
Hands off me!

53:25.869 --> 53:29.289
Run, Kameyata!

53:29.831 --> 53:31.207
Quick!

53:35.795 --> 53:37.881
One's getting away!

54:40.694 --> 54:42.028
Don't worry.

54:42.529 --> 54:44.572
I'll make it look like suicide.

54:54.958 --> 54:56.292
What do you want?

55:00.338 --> 55:01.548
Leave him.

55:19.065 --> 55:21.109
Are you Battosai?

55:23.611 --> 55:25.405
This should be fun.

56:16.206 --> 56:20.085
Soji Okita, 1st Unit Captain
of the Shinsengumi.

56:22.879 --> 56:25.173
I can't let you reach the Ikedaya.

58:50.777 --> 58:53.196
Is this Battosai, Okita?

58:53.279 --> 58:54.113
Yes.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.659
He's not so tough as the stories.

58:59.077 --> 59:01.871
The Ikedaya's secure. I'll handle this.

59:03.915 --> 59:05.375
That won't do.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.712
You can't take him now.

59:27.564 --> 59:28.690
Himura, no!

59:34.028 --> 59:37.907
It's all right. Mr. Katsura got away.

59:39.492 --> 59:44.330
The Aizu men are coming.
There's no point in fighting now.

59:45.999 --> 59:47.083
Come on.

1:00:00.888 --> 1:00:01.973
Himura!

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:20.241
You're turning tail, Battosai?

1:00:28.416 --> 1:00:29.584
Come on, Himura!

1:00:34.714 --> 1:00:36.841
That's an order from Mr. Katsura!

1:01:00.865 --> 1:01:01.783
Stop.

1:01:05.244 --> 1:01:07.622
No matter how outnumbered,
you are no match for him.

1:01:49.872 --> 1:01:51.833
Make way!

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:55.461
The Shinsengumi will bring order
to the streets of Kyoto!

1:01:56.003 --> 1:01:57.964
Those are our orders!

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:12.311
JULY 19, 1864

1:02:12.395 --> 1:02:19.402
KINMON INCIDENT

1:02:31.789 --> 1:02:36.753
What could those idiots
have been thinking?

1:02:40.131 --> 1:02:41.466
Damn it!

1:02:43.009 --> 1:02:44.719
Now what?

1:02:46.679 --> 1:02:49.640
There are even more shogun's men around
since the Ikedaya.

1:02:50.641 --> 1:02:53.728
Our Choshu Restoration Patriots
have been destroyed.

1:02:54.896 --> 1:03:00.568
And since they burned the city,
we've been condemned as rebels!

1:03:04.572 --> 1:03:05.865
Rebels…

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:08.576
against the Emperor!

1:03:10.828 --> 1:03:11.704
Damn it!

1:03:12.413 --> 1:03:13.706
It sticks in my throat!

1:03:25.468 --> 1:03:26.886
We need to pull out.

1:03:28.763 --> 1:03:31.224
The Shinsengumi could come any time.

1:03:34.227 --> 1:03:35.770
Mr. Katsura's safe.

1:03:37.522 --> 1:03:39.106
That's good enough.

1:04:32.243 --> 1:04:33.369
I'm sorry.

1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:50.511
I boast about never killing townsfolk…

1:04:53.973 --> 1:04:56.142
and now look at me.

1:05:00.438 --> 1:05:01.939
Leave, please.

1:05:12.241 --> 1:05:13.659
I'll stay with you…

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:18.122
a while longer.

1:05:19.665 --> 1:05:26.088
Right now, you need something
to help you restrain your madness.

1:05:35.389 --> 1:05:37.391
In answer to your question…

1:05:41.812 --> 1:05:46.734
I would never kill you,
even if you had a sword.

1:05:52.657 --> 1:05:54.367
No matter what…

1:05:58.746 --> 1:06:01.082
I would never kill you.

1:06:09.423 --> 1:06:10.716
Not you.

1:06:14.595 --> 1:06:15.596
Never.

1:06:22.353 --> 1:06:23.396
Shinsengumi!

1:06:28.651 --> 1:06:30.152
This way. Hurry!

1:06:38.494 --> 1:06:39.328
Quick!

1:06:40.037 --> 1:06:41.163
Out the back!

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:02.268
Hurry!

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:45.394
What would the Shogun's
Shinsengumi want with us?

1:07:46.312 --> 1:07:48.355
-Search the place!
-Yes, sir!

1:07:49.982 --> 1:07:51.317
What do you think you're doing?

1:07:52.193 --> 1:07:54.195
Look again!

1:09:06.016 --> 1:09:07.351
Mr. Katsura.

1:09:13.566 --> 1:09:16.277
I have to make myself scarce.

1:09:17.570 --> 1:09:21.031
I can't go to Choshu,
but I'll get caught if I stay here.

1:09:25.327 --> 1:09:27.329
Does it all end here?

1:09:28.247 --> 1:09:31.500
We wait for our chance.
Now is not the time.

1:09:32.334 --> 1:09:33.669
And me?

1:09:34.211 --> 1:09:37.047
There's a village outside Kyoto.

1:09:38.090 --> 1:09:41.302
Hide there until we start again.

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:45.014
Iizuka or Katagai
will bring you what you need.

1:09:48.893 --> 1:09:50.144
All right.

1:09:52.605 --> 1:09:53.480
Tomoe…

1:09:54.773 --> 1:09:58.527
could you go and stay with Himura?

1:10:03.157 --> 1:10:06.327
A woman will make it easier
for you to hide.

1:10:07.661 --> 1:10:08.537
You only need…

1:10:10.247 --> 1:10:11.790
to pretend.

1:10:20.174 --> 1:10:21.550
Look after him.

1:10:44.448 --> 1:10:45.741
Well?

1:10:48.535 --> 1:10:52.748
I have nowhere else to go.

1:10:54.708 --> 1:10:57.002
I'm sure there's somewhere.

1:11:09.014 --> 1:11:10.266
I'm sorry.

1:11:11.558 --> 1:11:14.728
It's not fair to force
the decision on you.

1:11:18.691 --> 1:11:19.984
Live with me.

1:11:21.777 --> 1:11:26.407
Being who I am,
I can't say how long it will last.

1:11:30.869 --> 1:11:32.913
Not just pretending.

1:11:35.624 --> 1:11:36.834
For real.

1:11:42.965 --> 1:11:43.966
Yes.

1:11:46.427 --> 1:11:48.679
I'll go with you.

1:12:30.971 --> 1:12:33.223
Smell that earth!

1:13:36.453 --> 1:13:37.371
Thank you.

1:13:43.043 --> 1:13:44.837
You got lots.

1:15:58.345 --> 1:16:00.681
You're eating with an appetite.

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:22.744
I've realized something here.

1:16:29.918 --> 1:16:35.591
I've been fighting to bring
a new age of happiness…

1:16:36.592 --> 1:16:39.553
for as many people as possible.

1:16:41.263 --> 1:16:44.224
But now I know it was conceit.

1:16:50.397 --> 1:16:53.567
What is happiness?

1:16:56.236 --> 1:16:58.405
I didn't understand anything about it.

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:11.835
I feel like living here with you
has answered that question for me.

1:18:24.950 --> 1:18:29.454
You smile a lot more lately
than you used to.

1:18:51.977 --> 1:18:53.061
Hi.

1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:05.949
Thanks.

1:19:06.908 --> 1:19:11.413
You're coming to look like
a real married couple.

1:19:14.458 --> 1:19:16.084
I'll go outside.

1:19:21.298 --> 1:19:22.966
Did I say something?

1:19:23.592 --> 1:19:26.720
No. Why are you here?

1:19:27.304 --> 1:19:28.305
Well.

1:19:32.642 --> 1:19:34.227
Things aren't good.

1:19:38.106 --> 1:19:41.735
To please the shogunate,
our domain conservatives

1:19:41.818 --> 1:19:44.196
are ordering men to commit suicide.

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:48.241
They say there's not a day
that goes by without one.

1:19:49.576 --> 1:19:51.161
And Mr. Katsura?

1:19:52.579 --> 1:19:56.291
In the domain, they're calling him
"Runaway Kogoro."

1:19:57.876 --> 1:19:59.336
Choshu's finished.

1:20:00.754 --> 1:20:01.838
You can't mean that.

1:20:02.756 --> 1:20:04.508
That's how it is now.

1:20:06.551 --> 1:20:09.179
All we can do is wait.

1:20:13.642 --> 1:20:15.477
Here's some expense money.

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:17.729
From Mr. Katagai.

1:20:18.772 --> 1:20:19.898
And…

1:20:20.524 --> 1:20:21.483
I'll leave this.

1:20:23.443 --> 1:20:25.654
Sell potions.

1:20:26.905 --> 1:20:30.909
No one will suspect you
if you're out doing business.

1:20:43.964 --> 1:20:45.423
See you, Tomoe.

1:20:47.592 --> 1:20:50.178
Now you're a peddler's wife.

1:21:34.097 --> 1:21:38.435
The look in Battosai's eyes has changed
in the past few months.

1:21:44.566 --> 1:21:46.026
Now's your chance.

1:21:51.281 --> 1:21:56.912
This is quite the armory
your Shadow Warriors have laid in here.

1:22:07.380 --> 1:22:09.132
Iizuka, you traitor!

1:22:12.385 --> 1:22:16.723
Looks like you were followed.
You're slipping up, Iizuka.

1:22:22.854 --> 1:22:25.106
Katagai! He's Katsura's right-hand man!

1:22:25.190 --> 1:22:27.901
When they find out he's missing…

1:22:28.693 --> 1:22:29.736
In that case…

1:22:30.445 --> 1:22:34.532
let's get started on the operation
to eliminate Battosai.

1:22:37.327 --> 1:22:40.997
Enishi, you're on.

1:23:20.495 --> 1:23:21.788
Enishi?

1:23:23.665 --> 1:23:24.708
Enishi!

1:23:26.459 --> 1:23:30.755
What a surprise! It's been so long!

1:23:34.134 --> 1:23:35.885
You're all grown up!

1:23:37.887 --> 1:23:39.723
When did you come from Edo?

1:23:41.975 --> 1:23:43.476
Is Father well?

1:23:43.977 --> 1:23:45.103
I don't know.

1:23:46.855 --> 1:23:49.941
I left for Kyoto right after you did.

1:23:53.278 --> 1:23:54.612
What do you mean?

1:23:55.947 --> 1:23:57.657
What are you doing?

1:23:58.241 --> 1:23:59.617
Helping you.

1:24:07.709 --> 1:24:12.797
Enishi, how did you find me here?

1:24:13.381 --> 1:24:16.760
Easy. I'm a messenger, after all.

1:24:21.264 --> 1:24:22.515
Good news, Tomoe.

1:24:24.142 --> 1:24:29.397
It's finally time for heaven
to levy judgment on Battosai.

1:24:45.538 --> 1:24:46.581
Enishi!

1:24:55.090 --> 1:24:59.260
Welcome home. That was my brother, Enishi.

1:25:01.179 --> 1:25:05.809
Oh, you have a brother?

1:25:06.392 --> 1:25:09.062
Please excuse his behavior.

1:25:12.690 --> 1:25:15.401
Well, I've stolen his big sister.

1:25:24.536 --> 1:25:26.037
It's getting cold.

1:25:45.473 --> 1:25:50.103
Could I talk to you a little?

1:25:56.943 --> 1:25:59.028
My parents' home is in Edo.

1:26:01.406 --> 1:26:03.533
We weren't rich…

1:26:04.534 --> 1:26:11.332
but my father, my brother, and I
lived peacefully there.

1:26:15.879 --> 1:26:21.134
My father is a low-ranked samurai,
good with neither pen nor sword…

1:26:23.553 --> 1:26:25.471
but a kind man.

1:26:28.141 --> 1:26:34.564
My mother was frail and she died
just after Enishi was born.

1:26:40.862 --> 1:26:43.114
<i>He never knew her.</i>

1:26:44.866 --> 1:26:50.079
<i>He jumps to conclusions,
and that gets him in trouble…</i>

1:26:52.373 --> 1:26:54.125
<i>but he's dear to me.</i>

1:27:07.805 --> 1:27:09.140
I was…

1:27:11.726 --> 1:27:15.730
engaged to be married.

1:27:19.859 --> 1:27:25.865
He was the second son of a family
of the same status as ours.

1:27:27.700 --> 1:27:29.577
A childhood friend.

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:39.754
For my sake,
he said he wanted to rise in the world.

1:27:42.090 --> 1:27:47.220
He volunteered for the Watch,
and came to Kyoto.

1:27:53.768 --> 1:27:55.770
Before the wedding…

1:27:58.356 --> 1:28:04.821
in the unrest in Kyoto,
he made the ultimate sacrifice.

1:28:25.758 --> 1:28:27.593
If only I'd clung to him in Edo

1:28:30.722 --> 1:28:32.515
and stopped him from coming…

1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:45.153
If only I'd said I was happy
whether he rose in the world or not…

1:28:49.657 --> 1:28:51.951
Why didn't I?

1:28:57.540 --> 1:29:01.836
The more I think about it…

1:29:27.028 --> 1:29:28.404
That's enough.

1:29:32.241 --> 1:29:33.868
No more.

1:30:53.739 --> 1:30:55.700
When I first met you…

1:30:57.785 --> 1:31:03.374
you said I could make it rain blood.

1:31:06.627 --> 1:31:10.464
You asked if someone
could really fight for peace.

1:31:12.633 --> 1:31:13.551
Yes.

1:31:20.850 --> 1:31:22.560
I'm sure…

1:31:24.729 --> 1:31:27.690
I'll end up killing again…

1:31:30.318 --> 1:31:32.987
until the new age is here.

1:31:38.159 --> 1:31:39.827
But when that day comes,

1:31:42.997 --> 1:31:45.249
although this may sound foolish…

1:31:48.252 --> 1:31:50.379
I'll start looking for a way…

1:31:52.423 --> 1:31:54.884
to defend, not kill.

1:32:01.891 --> 1:32:06.020
A way to preserve the happiness of all…

1:32:09.023 --> 1:32:13.236
to bear the weight of my sins,
and atone for them.

1:32:18.783 --> 1:32:19.992
Tomoe…

1:32:22.245 --> 1:32:25.122
the happiness you've lost once…

1:32:28.084 --> 1:32:30.044
you will never lose again.

1:32:38.844 --> 1:32:40.012
Yes.

1:35:35.396 --> 1:35:36.605
Mr. Iizuka?

1:35:38.774 --> 1:35:40.234
We found our spy.

1:35:43.404 --> 1:35:44.405
It's Tomoe.

1:35:47.241 --> 1:35:48.284
What?

1:35:52.830 --> 1:35:56.709
There's proof. Look in her diary.

1:36:05.092 --> 1:36:07.511
<i>If you want revenge…</i>

1:36:08.929 --> 1:36:13.893
get close to Battosai and find out
all you can about him.

1:36:17.271 --> 1:36:21.484
Find his weak points.

1:36:58.771 --> 1:37:01.815
Why drag Enishi into this?

1:37:02.942 --> 1:37:05.361
We didn't do that.

1:37:06.362 --> 1:37:11.784
He was asking about you in Kyoto.
The shogun's men brought him here.

1:37:15.788 --> 1:37:16.997
Where's everyone else?

1:37:18.082 --> 1:37:19.583
At their posts.

1:37:21.877 --> 1:37:24.046
Without hearing my report?

1:37:25.047 --> 1:37:26.298
Report?

1:37:31.762 --> 1:37:33.681
On Battosai's weak points?

1:37:36.141 --> 1:37:37.726
We don't need that.

1:37:41.855 --> 1:37:48.279
It's faster to make one than look for
one that might not even be there.

1:37:52.074 --> 1:37:54.910
No matter how cold-blooded,

1:37:55.619 --> 1:37:58.455
no man is without feelings.

1:38:04.336 --> 1:38:06.755
When he finds out you're a spy…

1:38:07.965 --> 1:38:11.010
he'll be too torn up to think straight.

1:38:12.052 --> 1:38:15.639
He won't be able to fight at his best.

1:38:20.019 --> 1:38:24.857
Was that the plan all along? To use me?

1:38:53.052 --> 1:38:55.304
The man who gave you that scar…

1:38:56.847 --> 1:39:00.851
Tomoe was supposed to become his wife.

1:39:06.565 --> 1:39:08.150
<i>April 5th.</i>

1:39:09.151 --> 1:39:14.365
<i>Before our wedding,
Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

1:39:18.369 --> 1:39:20.079
<i>I can't die!</i>

1:39:22.081 --> 1:39:24.041
There's someone I love.

1:39:24.958 --> 1:39:26.251
I was…

1:39:27.044 --> 1:39:31.131
<i>engaged to be married.</i>

1:39:34.051 --> 1:39:37.805
<i>He was the second son of a family
of the same status as ours.</i>

1:39:39.098 --> 1:39:40.641
<i>A childhood friend.</i>

1:39:54.405 --> 1:39:56.073
<i>Rejoice.</i>

1:39:58.158 --> 1:40:01.286
You'll have your revenge…

1:40:02.204 --> 1:40:03.872
and you'll be free.

1:40:14.633 --> 1:40:16.176
You won't kill him!

1:40:20.222 --> 1:40:22.808
Your heart's ruling your head!

1:40:45.998 --> 1:40:51.253
<i>They're at an old temple in the hills.
Tomoe's probably there too.</i>

1:40:53.881 --> 1:40:55.424
Finish her off.

1:40:56.717 --> 1:40:57.968
<i>That's an order.</i>

1:41:03.974 --> 1:41:06.560
<i>The happiness you've lost once…</i>

1:41:07.644 --> 1:41:10.063
you will never lose again.

1:41:24.328 --> 1:41:25.454
Listen.

1:41:26.121 --> 1:41:31.251
In the end, love and hate
are two sides of the same coin.

1:41:33.045 --> 1:41:35.839
And that coin is karma.

1:43:42.966 --> 1:43:46.720
My task, if I can't bring you down myself…

1:43:46.803 --> 1:43:49.932
is to send you on to our next man.

1:43:59.483 --> 1:44:00.359
Now…

1:44:03.612 --> 1:44:06.573
all that's left is to die
and become divine.

1:44:25.425 --> 1:44:27.803
You're worried about him?

1:44:30.389 --> 1:44:34.142
Don't forget how this started.

1:44:37.396 --> 1:44:42.859
You must have meant everything
to that guy Kiyosato.

1:44:43.527 --> 1:44:47.572
Why else would he come to Kyoto
to join the Watch?

1:44:48.699 --> 1:44:54.413
He wanted to make you happy,
even if it meant risking his life.

1:44:59.251 --> 1:45:01.461
To make a woman happy,

1:45:02.671 --> 1:45:08.260
a man must defend his family, his village,
and the shogunate itself.

1:45:09.344 --> 1:45:12.639
Without peace, without the shogun,

1:45:14.641 --> 1:45:17.561
there is happiness for no one.

1:45:56.391 --> 1:45:57.517
<i>And thus…</i>

1:45:57.601 --> 1:46:00.187
no matter how small they are…

1:46:00.771 --> 1:46:05.692
any shoots of resistance to the Shogun
must be pulled out by the roots.

1:46:05.776 --> 1:46:10.322
That caution is why these shoguns
have brought 300 years of peace!

1:46:11.531 --> 1:46:15.452
That we must support,
and that we must preserve!

1:46:18.622 --> 1:46:20.540
We must preserve that happiness…

1:46:24.336 --> 1:46:26.088
with our lives.

1:47:25.814 --> 1:47:27.232
<i>Understand?</i>

1:47:28.525 --> 1:47:31.111
<i>That is a warrior's destiny.</i>

1:47:33.321 --> 1:47:35.198
We are all…

1:47:37.033 --> 1:47:39.327
sinful creatures.

1:47:41.037 --> 1:47:43.081
Battosai!

1:47:47.377 --> 1:47:49.671
You forgot this!

1:47:58.847 --> 1:48:00.348
Sumita…

1:48:04.686 --> 1:48:06.479
And Mumyoi?

1:48:30.253 --> 1:48:33.798
To defend our world,
and preserve the shogun…

1:48:34.841 --> 1:48:36.593
I will stop this man myself.

1:48:39.471 --> 1:48:46.228
That is the only way to honor
those who have died for the shogun!

1:48:49.439 --> 1:48:50.774
Lie there…

1:48:52.609 --> 1:48:54.653
and watch.

1:49:43.618 --> 1:49:45.203
Can you hear me, Battosai?

1:49:48.415 --> 1:49:51.418
Can you see me?

1:50:30.290 --> 1:50:31.750
Well, Battosai?

1:50:33.335 --> 1:50:38.882
How does it feel to love a woman
who came only to kill you?

1:52:20.066 --> 1:52:22.026
You don't have a chance.

1:52:25.780 --> 1:52:27.782
Why keep fighting?

1:52:29.701 --> 1:52:30.910
For who?

1:52:33.496 --> 1:52:34.789
For what?

1:53:22.003 --> 1:53:27.509
Do you want to die bit by bit,
or do you want it all at once?

1:53:29.177 --> 1:53:31.596
The choice is yours.

1:56:13.508 --> 1:56:15.885
I'm sorry…

1:56:18.096 --> 1:56:19.722
my love.

1:57:20.575 --> 1:57:22.076
Tomoe…

1:58:08.039 --> 1:58:09.791
Katagai's dead.

1:58:11.459 --> 1:58:14.378
Iizuka was the spy.

1:58:17.298 --> 1:58:19.509
We've sent someone after him.

1:58:22.136 --> 1:58:23.513
I see.

1:58:24.722 --> 1:58:31.104
The man we've sent is
as good with a sword as you.

1:58:32.105 --> 1:58:34.899
He'll do our assassinations from now on.

1:58:52.375 --> 1:58:55.002
And as for you, Himura…

1:58:56.629 --> 1:59:00.675
It might not be fair to you now,
but I'll need your sword…

1:59:01.509 --> 1:59:04.846
even more from now on.

1:59:06.430 --> 1:59:11.435
The Shogun's patriot hunt
gets worse every day.

1:59:12.186 --> 1:59:17.150
If we don't fight back,
we'll be wiped out.

1:59:24.323 --> 1:59:26.450
If I hang up my sword now…

1:59:29.745 --> 1:59:33.833
all the lives I've taken so far
will have been a waste.

1:59:40.089 --> 1:59:42.425
Until the new age comes…

1:59:43.885 --> 1:59:46.012
I will wield my sword.

1:59:49.891 --> 1:59:52.518
But the moment it arrives…

1:59:53.144 --> 1:59:56.314
You'll throw your sword away?

2:00:04.280 --> 2:00:05.740
I don't know.

2:00:09.285 --> 2:00:11.787
But I will never kill again.

2:00:14.248 --> 2:00:15.625
Not again.

2:00:17.251 --> 2:00:18.502
Never.

2:00:26.177 --> 2:00:27.511
I see…

2:02:32.303 --> 2:02:33.763
<i>April 5th.</i>

2:02:35.765 --> 2:02:40.936
<i>Before our wedding,
Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

2:02:43.314 --> 2:02:46.317
<i>I cannot believe he is no longer with us.</i>

2:02:47.610 --> 2:02:52.823
<i>The childhood days we spent together
seem like only yesterday.</i>

2:02:59.413 --> 2:03:01.248
<i>April 14th.</i>

2:03:02.166 --> 2:03:03.834
<i>I have learned the truth.</i>

2:03:06.170 --> 2:03:08.756
<i>I do not know what I should do.</i>

2:03:10.925 --> 2:03:13.010
<i>Should I just accept that it was fate?</i>

2:03:15.721 --> 2:03:17.723
<i>The rain goes on.</i>

2:03:20.101 --> 2:03:22.728
<i>I want to avenge Kiyosato.</i>

2:03:34.031 --> 2:03:36.951
<i>I wasn't there when he died.</i>

2:03:38.786 --> 2:03:40.996
<i>My happiness died with him.</i>

2:03:44.291 --> 2:03:46.085
<i>I could not catch and hold…</i>

2:03:48.045 --> 2:03:50.172
<i>the happiness I saw before me.</i>

2:03:53.175 --> 2:03:54.176
<i>If only…</i>

2:03:55.594 --> 2:03:57.721
<i>I had begged him not to go.</i>

2:03:59.974 --> 2:04:05.938
<i>I have given myself
to schemes to kill that man.</i>

2:04:09.859 --> 2:04:13.195
<i>Otherwise, I would go mad.</i>

2:04:16.657 --> 2:04:17.950
<i>And yet you say…</i>

2:04:19.827 --> 2:04:20.911
<i>you'd protect…</i>

2:04:22.955 --> 2:04:24.874
<i>a woman like me.</i>

2:04:38.053 --> 2:04:42.516
<i>I will leave Kyoto, and live with him.</i>

2:04:45.644 --> 2:04:47.438
<i>When did he become…</i>

2:04:48.314 --> 2:04:51.108
<i>so dear to me?</i>

2:04:55.070 --> 2:05:00.701
<i>He is still not used to it,
but he seems to enjoy fieldwork.</i>

2:05:03.162 --> 2:05:09.919
<i>I am glad to see that
the lines of his face have softened.</i>

2:05:14.965 --> 2:05:16.800
<i>December 26th.</i>

2:05:18.427 --> 2:05:19.803
<i>The rain has turned to snow.</i>

2:05:22.181 --> 2:05:23.974
<i>I feel that winter is here.</i>

2:05:30.898 --> 2:05:35.152
<i>He is the man who robbed me
of my happiness…</i>

2:05:36.904 --> 2:05:39.198
<i>whom I hated enough to kill.</i>

2:05:42.117 --> 2:05:47.873
<i>But the way things are going,
I will fall truly in love with him.</i>

2:05:56.590 --> 2:06:00.678
<i>He will kill again.</i>

2:06:01.845 --> 2:06:04.974
<i>But after all his killing is done…</i>

2:06:06.267 --> 2:06:11.021
<i>I am sure he will preserve
many more than he has killed.</i>

2:06:12.898 --> 2:06:14.733
<i>I must not let him die now.</i>

2:06:18.696 --> 2:06:20.030
<i>I will preserve him…</i>

2:06:22.616 --> 2:06:24.243
<i>though it means my life.</i>

2:06:30.874 --> 2:06:31.834
<i>Goodbye…</i>

2:06:34.962 --> 2:06:36.297
<i>to the second man…</i>

2:06:38.382 --> 2:06:39.717
<i>I loved.</i>

2:07:34.688 --> 2:07:36.023
Well…

2:07:38.067 --> 2:07:41.570
I'll be on my way, Tomoe.

2:08:48.137 --> 2:08:55.102
THE BATTLE OF TOBA-FUSHIMI
JANUARY 1868, KYOTO

2:09:29.595 --> 2:09:31.764
Saito! The shogunate dog!

2:09:32.264 --> 2:09:33.223
Ready!

2:10:04.838 --> 2:10:06.632
We've won!

2:10:07.132 --> 2:10:09.384
It's the Emperor's banner!

2:10:13.972 --> 2:10:15.140
Victory!

2:10:21.939 --> 2:10:23.148
So it has come, hasn't it?

2:10:25.025 --> 2:10:26.693
The new age…

2:10:33.367 --> 2:10:34.368
At last.

2:10:40.749 --> 2:10:41.959
Battosai!

2:10:54.888 --> 2:10:56.515
It doesn't end here.

2:11:38.682 --> 2:11:40.350
Some 160 years ago,

2:11:40.434 --> 2:11:45.022
the black foreign ships
led to the shogun's fall.

2:11:45.105 --> 2:11:51.695
Out of the resulting maelstrom
came a warrior, Battosai the Killer.

2:11:51.778 --> 2:11:58.577
When calm was restored, he vanished…

2:11:58.660 --> 2:12:05.667
and became a lone wanderer.

2:12:11.173 --> 2:12:17.638
It would be ten years
before he appeared again.

2:16:26.178 --> 2:16:31.808
