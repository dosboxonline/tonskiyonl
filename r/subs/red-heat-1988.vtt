03:15.834 --> 03:17.917
This is not a foundry worker's hand.

03:18.292 --> 03:20.167
If you work with steel,

03:20.459 --> 03:22.042
you should be used to the heat.

04:06.376 --> 04:09.709
I want Rosta! Viktor Rosta!

04:09.834 --> 04:11.501
- He left!
- Where?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.834
Druzhba Cafe!

07:01.084 --> 07:02.709
It's getting harder.

07:02.959 --> 07:05.792
Ten years ago, no drugs.
Now we have a problem.

07:06.167 --> 07:08.917
Another ten years, it'll be like Harlem.

07:09.126 --> 07:10.501
It'll never happen.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.209
You're wrong.

07:12.876 --> 07:17.292
You know your new nickname?
The officers called you Iron Jaw,

07:17.501 --> 07:22.042
but after the fight in the snow,
they call you Roundheaded.

07:27.792 --> 07:28.959
How's your cold?

07:29.084 --> 07:32.792
Awful. Did your mother teach you
any home remedies?

07:33.584 --> 07:36.126
Try holding a hot rock in your hand.

07:36.459 --> 07:39.042
All right, listen.
You go first and I'll stay behind.

07:39.376 --> 07:44.001
To make sure our men
are positioned properly.

07:44.501 --> 07:45.501
Let's get them.

08:46.251 --> 08:48.459
Everything's okay.
No problem, officer.

09:21.709 --> 09:23.417
Let's go. All of you.

09:24.667 --> 09:30.209
Why do you always
pick on us Georgians?

09:32.251 --> 09:36.167
We are just simple people.

09:37.209 --> 09:40.917
Maybe that is why we are such easy prey.

09:41.584 --> 09:42.959
What's this country coming to?!

09:43.084 --> 09:45.501
This is like the old days!

09:46.501 --> 09:49.001
We are not guilty of anything!

09:49.126 --> 09:52.334
Where is your evidence?

09:52.667 --> 09:54.501
I got his brother in the leg.

11:43.292 --> 11:44.417
Ivan!

12:32.209 --> 12:36.751
Freeze! You are under arrest!
Drop your gun!

12:36.876 --> 12:37.917
Now!

12:39.834 --> 12:41.834
Handcuffs would be a good Idea.

13:59.376 --> 14:03.751
Our informants say Rosta fled the country

14:05.251 --> 14:06.667
with two other criminals...

14:08.001 --> 14:11.667
Josip Baroda and Pytor Tatamovich.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.417
We'll find him.

14:16.001 --> 14:19.751
He'll pay for his crimes
against the people.

15:03.292 --> 15:05.012
Abdul Elijah
says we're in business.

15:05.042 --> 15:07.876
Get the capital in a safe place
as previously discussed, dig?

15:08.209 --> 15:10.102
<i>Meet me back here at three o'clock.
You bring me a key.</i>

15:10.126 --> 15:11.566
<i>We go check the color of your green.</i>

15:12.334 --> 15:14.518
Your shipment's on its way.
I believe you have something,

15:14.542 --> 15:17.022
a small item for me.
I'm supposed to give you a courier, right?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.501
<i>Bless Abdul Elijah and the brotherhood.
Nice doing business with you, comrade.</i>

15:54.084 --> 15:55.584
We're in business.

16:03.542 --> 16:08.751
Oh. Attention. Fun bag patrol.
Double bogies, 11 o'clock.

16:09.542 --> 16:11.667
Christ.

16:12.709 --> 16:15.167
You think she bought those?
I don't think so.

16:15.292 --> 16:17.092
I don't think so.
I think those are homegrown.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.869
- Yeah, those are definitely homegrown.
- Art.

16:21.876 --> 16:23.001
Just an opinion.

16:24.376 --> 16:25.584
Jesus.

16:28.501 --> 16:30.101
Guy's gotta be dead not to notice those.

16:30.167 --> 16:31.727
What's the matter with you,
Art?

16:31.751 --> 16:35.501
- I'm a man. I got needs.
- For Christ sake, we're on a job. Come on.

16:36.876 --> 16:38.001
We ought to arrest her.

16:44.709 --> 16:45.949
So what'd you squeeze him with?

16:46.626 --> 16:48.001
Caught him packing on parole.

16:48.709 --> 16:52.001
Gave him a choice: Whisper in my ear,
or I turn him into Miss Joliet

16:52.126 --> 16:53.542
for the next three to five.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.251
He tipped you to a big cleanhead deal?

16:55.376 --> 16:57.584
Oh man, don't tell me we're popping
the cleanheads here.

16:57.709 --> 16:59.459
I hate the goddamn cleanheads.

16:59.584 --> 17:01.504
All right. you are this close
to losing your job.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.376
Can you just give us a second, Charlie?

17:05.041 --> 17:06.166
Yeah, right.

17:09.209 --> 17:10.959
You're not helping yourself here, Art.

17:11.334 --> 17:14.126
This is a good tip.
I got it from my guy, Streak.

17:15.876 --> 17:18.584
All right. Come on, let's go.

17:31.001 --> 17:33.542
- Freeze!
- Freeze! Police! Hands up!

17:35.626 --> 17:36.751
Shut up!

17:36.876 --> 17:38.126
You ain't got shit.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.042
Follow me. You have the right
to remain silent.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.542
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

17:52.751 --> 17:54.167
You have the right to talk to a...

18:01.459 --> 18:02.584
Outside stairwell.

18:29.667 --> 18:30.917
Freeze, motherfucker!

18:33.126 --> 18:34.167
Don't get nervous.

18:34.292 --> 18:36.209
- I do this for a living.
- Gimme that.

18:36.334 --> 18:37.542
Come on.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.084
You look like Marvin Hagler to me.

18:40.834 --> 18:42.376
I lost money on Hagler!

18:58.167 --> 19:00.167
Hey! How long
you gonna be in there, man?

19:00.292 --> 19:02.167
You're not even using
the goddamn phone.

19:05.042 --> 19:06.167
Jerk.

20:13.792 --> 20:16.417
Yes, top priority.
I'm expecting confirmation.

20:16.876 --> 20:19.167
We'll take extreme precaution.

20:20.834 --> 20:25.459
Take this to Colonel Kulikov immediately.
Then send for Captain Danko.

20:25.959 --> 20:29.376
He is to report as soon as possible.

20:30.084 --> 20:32.376
Good news, comrade.

20:32.501 --> 20:33.959
America.

20:34.251 --> 20:35.709
America, yes.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.501
Chicago. Gangster.

20:50.126 --> 20:53.751
You are being given
a great responsibility, captain.

20:55.751 --> 20:58.501
Viktor has been arrested
for a minor offense.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.542
His two accomplices are still at large.

21:03.501 --> 21:08.709
Viktor was organizing a huge
cocaine shipment from America.

21:09.292 --> 21:12.292
Our informants say
five million dollars' worth.

21:13.751 --> 21:15.334
Bring Viktor home.

21:16.084 --> 21:19.667
Bring him home.
But don't tell the Americans.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.417
I repeat, tell the Americans nothing.

21:22.417 --> 21:23.917
Do not discuss our problems.

21:24.459 --> 21:25.876
Bring Viktor to us.

21:26.542 --> 21:31.626
We will avenge Yuri and protect ourselves

21:31.834 --> 21:33.667
from the poison of the West.

21:35.334 --> 21:36.417
Trust me.

21:45.209 --> 21:48.376
<i>O'Hare skybus leaving
for downtown in five minutes.</i>

21:49.292 --> 21:53.167
<i>O'Hare skybus leaving
for downtown in five minutes.</i>

21:55.084 --> 21:56.602
- How you doing, honey?
- Blow yourself.

21:56.626 --> 21:59.292
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good thinking.

22:01.792 --> 22:03.042
He should be out any second.

22:03.751 --> 22:05.626
He's going through customs right now.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.786
You read the report Stobbs wrote
on the cleanhead bust?

22:08.959 --> 22:11.626
Yeah. He said your performance
was adequate.

22:11.751 --> 22:14.459
Adequate. Jesus Christ. What a jerk.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.876
- It's a personality thing, Art.
- Yeah.

22:17.001 --> 22:19.209
Stobbs just doesn't like yours.

22:25.417 --> 22:26.917
Ten to one he doesn't speak English.

22:32.959 --> 22:35.334
- Captain Danko?
- Yes.

22:35.584 --> 22:39.084
I'm Detective Sergeant Gallagher,
Chicago Police Department.

22:39.209 --> 22:40.667
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.

22:42.084 --> 22:45.167
Oh, this is my partner,
Detective Sergeant Ridzik.

22:48.084 --> 22:50.751
- First time in Chicago?
- Yes.

22:51.376 --> 22:54.042
- You have a nice flight?
- Yes, fine.

22:55.501 --> 22:57.084
- You hungry?
- No.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.042
- Thirsty?
- No.

22:59.167 --> 23:01.959
Hate to break up this romance,
but I'm parked in a red zone.

23:03.209 --> 23:04.376
No offense.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.626
Uh, we got a car waiting outside for you.

23:08.751 --> 23:13.334
Be about a half-hour drive to the city.
It's a nice drive. You'll enjoy it.

23:15.126 --> 23:16.667
Nice night.

23:16.792 --> 23:17.792
Been real hot lately.

23:18.459 --> 23:20.751
Nothing hotter than Chicago in August.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.584
It's the humidity that gets to you.

23:25.459 --> 23:28.584
Humidity. You know, moisture in the air.

23:32.001 --> 23:34.209
- How's it been in Moscow?
- Hot.

23:35.501 --> 23:36.709
No moisture.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.751
Where'd you learn
to speak English so well?

23:41.001 --> 23:42.459
Army.

23:42.584 --> 23:46.126
Compulsory training.
Language school in Kiev.

23:46.251 --> 23:49.626
Oh, yeah. That's like as in Chicken Kiev.

23:50.126 --> 23:51.966
Yeah, we had that
at my sister's wedding.

23:53.917 --> 23:57.376
This Viktor Rosta, he must've
pissed off quite a few commissars...

23:57.751 --> 24:00.709
for them to send someone
all this way just to babysit him home.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.001
What did he do?

24:02.126 --> 24:03.917
Take a leak
on the Kremlin Wall or something?

24:07.376 --> 24:10.084
I gotta apologize for my partner, captain.

24:10.584 --> 24:12.751
You see,
he's just naturally suspicious of...

24:12.876 --> 24:14.251
Did you arrest Viktor?

24:14.626 --> 24:18.042
- Me? No, it was a couple of our patrolmen.
- Where?

24:19.209 --> 24:22.084
Right near his hotel, actually,
The Garvin.

24:22.209 --> 24:25.292
Yeah, it's a breeding ground
for pushers, pimps, prostitutes.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.302
- You know, anybody...
- Take me there.

24:28.001 --> 24:30.251
We got you booked at the Executive House.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.209
Please. Garvin.

24:39.626 --> 24:42.584
You sure you wanna stay here?
I mean, it's the pits. You have a choice.

24:42.709 --> 24:43.834
I stay here.

24:45.501 --> 24:48.167
- If you're on a budget I can talk to my...
- Thank you.

24:48.459 --> 24:49.459
I will be fine.

24:50.626 --> 24:52.584
Okay. You're the boss.

24:54.251 --> 24:57.012
I'll pick you up around
nine o'clock in the morning, okay?

24:58.792 --> 25:00.334
Hey, nice talking to you, captain.

25:07.542 --> 25:09.876
- What do you think, Art?
- I think he's a jerk.

25:18.792 --> 25:20.001
Danko.

25:20.251 --> 25:21.334
You're welcome.

25:33.084 --> 25:34.917
Put your name in the big book right there.

25:38.126 --> 25:40.376
You had man here called Rosta.

25:41.417 --> 25:42.459
Viktor Rosta.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.542
A Russian?

25:44.959 --> 25:46.334
Soviet.

25:46.834 --> 25:48.001
I want same room.

25:49.251 --> 25:50.501
Are you Russian too?

25:56.042 --> 25:57.167
Nice going.

25:59.876 --> 26:02.667
It's, uh... 302.

26:03.834 --> 26:05.126
Right up the stairs.

26:57.084 --> 26:58.126
Capitalism.

27:20.209 --> 27:21.626
And this is our booking area.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.251
Looks like a major crime wave
just hit, right?

27:27.501 --> 27:30.459
When I first walked in here
when they assigned me to this district,

27:31.167 --> 27:33.376
I thought all hell had broken loose.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.042
Nope.

27:36.167 --> 27:39.001
It was just a typical Monday morning.

27:39.126 --> 27:40.686
Is that a Russian cop uniform?

27:41.292 --> 27:44.167
Looks like a glorified postman
or something out of World War Two.

27:44.417 --> 27:47.334
- Be respectful to our guest, Audrey.
- Yes, sir.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.709
Not king.

27:51.292 --> 27:52.626
Checkmate in two moves.

27:53.251 --> 27:55.501
Use bishop to queen four.

27:56.584 --> 27:59.417
Thanks for your advice, comrade,
but, uh, I think I got it covered.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.042
This way, captain.

28:03.459 --> 28:05.167
The nerve of that guy.

28:07.001 --> 28:08.959
Captain Danko, Moscow Militia.

28:09.084 --> 28:11.542
This is Commander Donnelly,
chief of this district.

28:12.167 --> 28:14.376
Thanks, Tom. The captain
will be with you in a minute.

28:20.126 --> 28:24.084
This is an extradition order.
All it requires is your signature.

28:24.209 --> 28:26.876
He ran a red light.
Didn't have a valid driver's license.

28:27.001 --> 28:30.209
The arresting officer found a handgun
in his glove box, brought him in.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.167
We shook him down.
Then he refused to speak English.

28:33.292 --> 28:35.852
When we found the Cyrillic writing
tattooed across his shoulders,

28:35.876 --> 28:37.626
we figured out he was one of yours.

28:39.751 --> 28:44.334
- Viktor did not ask for political asylum?
- I think he's resigned to going home.

28:47.834 --> 28:50.709
Audrey, go get Sergeant Ridzik, will you?

28:51.084 --> 28:52.209
Right.

28:58.626 --> 28:59.834
Stress management.

29:01.209 --> 29:02.834
You watch the fishes.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.417
You water the plants.

29:04.626 --> 29:08.126
Special breathing exercises.
Monitor your blood pressure.

29:08.251 --> 29:10.371
Listen to pleasant sounds.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.126
Relax.

29:15.001 --> 29:17.209
Personally, I think
it may all be a pile of shit.

29:18.501 --> 29:22.584
But when you're facing a bypass,
you stop asking questions.

29:25.792 --> 29:27.751
Look, just out of curiosity,

29:27.876 --> 29:31.334
and, uh, since I figure
cops are cops the world over, uh...

29:32.542 --> 29:35.334
...how do you Soviets
deal with all the tension and stress?

29:36.751 --> 29:37.917
Vodka.

29:40.709 --> 29:43.334
- Yes, sir.
- Art, I want you to ride with Gallagher

29:43.459 --> 29:45.334
and the captain here to the city jail.

29:46.167 --> 29:49.376
Make sure he signs this form before
he and Gallagher go to the airport.

29:49.792 --> 29:51.334
Then bring the top copy back here.

29:51.667 --> 29:55.001
- Well, you're probably gonna want...
- Just bring the top form back to me.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.376
- Yes, sir.
- That'll make it official.

29:59.334 --> 30:02.001
So long, captain.
Nice doing business with you.

30:03.001 --> 30:04.161
- Gallagher!
- Yo!

30:04.209 --> 30:05.501
- Taxi service.
- Right.

30:18.001 --> 30:19.167
Stand up.

30:26.584 --> 30:29.084
I'm taking you home.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.917
Eat shit.

30:33.251 --> 30:34.571
You can tell they're old buddies.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.636
Body language is a beautiful thing,
isn't it?

30:39.417 --> 30:40.542
We are ready.

30:41.751 --> 30:42.792
Yes, sir.

30:57.501 --> 30:58.709
What is this key to?

30:59.459 --> 31:01.167
Kiss my ass.

31:02.751 --> 31:04.042
Do you know what this key open?

31:04.167 --> 31:05.876
Looks like a key to a locker to me.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.126
Why don't you ask your bud?

31:10.292 --> 31:11.292
You try it.

31:17.667 --> 31:23.042
Where is the locker that this key opens?

31:27.876 --> 31:29.667
- What'd he say?
- He say:

31:29.959 --> 31:32.917
"Go and kiss your mother's behind."

31:36.626 --> 31:38.709
You son of a bitch! Come here!

31:39.501 --> 31:41.542
- Stupid motherfucker!
- Take it easy!

31:41.667 --> 31:43.810
- All right, all right, I'm fine!
- For God's sakes.

31:43.834 --> 31:45.667
- Fine!
- Take it easy.

31:45.792 --> 31:47.876
- All right, all right.
- Take it easy.

31:48.001 --> 31:50.167
I'm fine. It happens all the time.

31:50.292 --> 31:53.001
Every day someone tells me
to go fuck my mother's ass.

31:55.084 --> 31:56.376
Have you seen my mother's ass?

31:57.042 --> 31:59.962
- No, I haven't seen your mother's ass.
- Well, you'd want to fuck it too.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.469
He shouldn't have said that
about my ma, Tom.

32:10.709 --> 32:13.626
What do you care what he says about
anything? It's not your case, Art.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.643
It's not my case.
It's not even an American case.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.209
All right, right, right, right, right.

32:17.584 --> 32:21.084
We're just an escort service here, Jesus.
Pull back on your emotions.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.893
Yeah. Well, you heard what he said.
How can I let that pass?

32:23.917 --> 32:26.001
- Then find a middle ground, Art.
- Yeah.

32:26.626 --> 32:27.667
This way, clown.

32:43.459 --> 32:44.709
All right, I'm out of here.

32:45.792 --> 32:48.042
Look, captain,
you have a good flight back, all right?

32:48.251 --> 32:51.167
And if you get a chance
to flush this giant turd down the toilet,

32:52.126 --> 32:53.209
do it over the Pole.

32:54.459 --> 32:57.299
Oh, by the way, you were right about
that chess move. I was dead in two.

32:58.084 --> 32:59.084
It was obvious.

33:08.126 --> 33:11.376
Forgive Ridzik, captain.
He's been having a hard time lately.

33:11.917 --> 33:15.001
- Put himself in a jam...
- I try to forget Ridzik.

33:23.917 --> 33:25.277
- Hey, Bernie.
- Yes, sir.

33:25.459 --> 33:27.667
Yeah, give me a <i>Sun Times</i>
and a Racing Action tip sheet.

33:27.792 --> 33:28.876
Yes, sir.

33:29.834 --> 33:30.959
You got a winner?

33:46.917 --> 33:48.334
Move!

33:48.459 --> 33:50.376
- Come on, let's move!
- I need the key!

33:54.959 --> 33:56.084
Come on, man!

33:56.292 --> 33:58.812
- Let's go, let's go!
- Move it. Let's move it, damn it!

35:07.959 --> 35:09.479
Well, how's he doing, doctor?

35:09.876 --> 35:11.334
It's still a little early.

35:12.334 --> 35:15.584
There's no fracture, but Captain Danko
does have a concussion.

35:15.709 --> 35:17.749
Well, we're gonna need him
to make a full statement.

35:18.292 --> 35:21.012
Well, I don't think you should plan
on getting much out of him today.

35:22.209 --> 35:23.209
Thank you very much.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.334
Gallagher didn't even get a shot off.

35:46.876 --> 35:48.516
I think it was the cleanheads who did it.

35:48.959 --> 35:51.352
Yeah, well, that's possible.
They all walked yesterday morning.

35:51.376 --> 35:52.501
Illegal warrant.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.667
- Even the guy with the shotgun?
- You bet.

35:54.792 --> 35:57.501
Walked right out the door
with a great big handshake from the judge.

35:57.751 --> 35:59.542
- Shit.
- Get a load of this.

35:59.834 --> 36:01.518
- This guy you nailed in here.
- Yeah.

36:01.542 --> 36:05.167
According to his ID, he's another Russian.
Can you believe that?

36:05.792 --> 36:09.709
Comrade Captain Danko,
this is Comrade Consul Stepanovich.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.084
I am Moussorsky, your liaison officer.

36:12.792 --> 36:14.542
We're here from Washington.

36:14.959 --> 36:18.584
We took the first flight
when we heard the news.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.084
We need to know what happened.

36:20.709 --> 36:24.042
Moscow must get a full report
when we return to Washington.

36:24.167 --> 36:25.792
There's nothing to report.

36:26.209 --> 36:28.292
Your attitude
is disappointing.

36:29.292 --> 36:33.001
He got away.
Get the details from the Americans.

36:33.334 --> 36:37.709
They ask too many questions.
It could be an embarrassment.

36:38.376 --> 36:41.001
Rosta escaped because of your stupidity.

36:41.209 --> 36:45.792
Rosta will finish his deal
and send the American poison home

36:46.126 --> 36:47.626
through his Georgian network.

36:48.209 --> 36:51.167
We are humiliated before the world.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.542
You've failed.

36:54.376 --> 36:56.667
Report whatever you want.

36:56.792 --> 36:59.709
I've already cabled Internal Affairs.

37:00.126 --> 37:04.876
Take the first plane to Moscow
when you leave the hospital.

37:05.501 --> 37:09.876
Your superiors want to see you
the moment you land.

37:20.959 --> 37:24.209
I'm sorry, but the police department
will have to bear with us, lieutenant.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.626
Captain Danko
should remain incommunicado.

37:27.751 --> 37:30.268
Well, the Russians got a chance
to talk to him. Why was that okay?

37:30.292 --> 37:32.084
They were the closest thing to family

37:32.209 --> 37:34.584
and they didn't intend to interrogate him.

37:38.376 --> 37:40.209
How did you get that piece
through customs?

37:41.876 --> 37:43.334
Diplomatic immunity.

37:44.001 --> 37:48.251
Great. That restores my faith
in airport security.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.417
You're not supposed
to have that gun, Danko.

37:51.834 --> 37:52.914
I'll tell you what, though.

37:54.667 --> 37:56.310
You tell me
what the hell's going on with Viktor,

37:56.334 --> 37:57.614
and I'll let you keep the piece.

37:58.126 --> 37:59.542
Take it.

37:59.751 --> 38:01.792
Oh, come on, give me a break
with this shit, huh?

38:01.917 --> 38:05.417
Maybe this Russian bully stuff
works on a chessboard, but not here.

38:06.709 --> 38:08.334
What, are you retiring your uniform?

38:08.459 --> 38:09.876
I now work undercover.

38:11.292 --> 38:12.459
Undercover?

38:13.126 --> 38:14.167
You look like Gumby.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.281
Yeah, you're gonna fit right in.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.792
For your information, captain,

38:21.667 --> 38:24.376
I bagged one of your Russians.
Unfortunately, he's not dead.

38:24.834 --> 38:26.501
He's in the intensive care unit.

38:26.626 --> 38:28.466
When he comes to,
maybe you should talk to him.

38:29.126 --> 38:30.917
How long before this happens?

38:31.209 --> 38:34.251
What is this, 60 Minutes?
Do I look like a doctor to you?

38:35.251 --> 38:36.626
Other things first.

38:38.959 --> 38:40.417
Hey, Gumby? Hey.

38:41.834 --> 38:43.518
Hey. Where the hell
do you think you're going?

38:43.542 --> 38:46.292
All right, lighten up.
Lighten up, I got it. Thanks.

38:47.542 --> 38:48.942
Hey, what are you doing out of bed?

38:49.209 --> 38:51.417
- He thinks he's gonna find Viktor.
- Oh that's cute.

38:51.542 --> 38:53.459
- Look, you keep an eye on him.
- Why me?

38:53.584 --> 38:56.251
Because I said so.
Look, he's a material witness.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.810
I'm gonna talk to Donnelly. Maybe
he can figure out what to do with him.

38:58.834 --> 39:01.518
- How come I get all the shit jobs?
- Because it fits you, Ridzik.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.709
- Yeah.
- You come with me, yes?

39:03.834 --> 39:07.126
- Well, you heard. I just got my orders.
- Take me to the same hotel.

39:07.542 --> 39:09.792
- Do I look like a fucking cab to you?
- Yes.

39:13.751 --> 39:14.852
Jessie, can I have the file...

39:14.876 --> 39:17.157
All right, all I did
was take him back to the hotel.

39:17.376 --> 39:19.459
He went in,
came out ten minutes later.

39:19.959 --> 39:22.477
I don't know what the hell to do with him,
so I brought him back here.

39:22.501 --> 39:23.876
Okay. Good.

39:25.084 --> 39:26.917
Look, about your involvement
in this thing,

39:27.917 --> 39:30.268
you know the standard procedure.
If you're a witness to a murder,

39:30.292 --> 39:33.102
you can no longer be an active participant
in the ensuing investigation.

39:33.126 --> 39:36.209
- But I think this is gonna be a little...
- Okay, okay, I know.

39:36.334 --> 39:38.042
I'm not taking you off the case.

39:39.084 --> 39:40.626
You and Gallagher were friends.

39:41.667 --> 39:42.959
I'll fit you in somehow.

39:45.417 --> 39:46.709
Send in Danko.

39:53.542 --> 39:56.001
The two Russian suits
that showed up out at the hospital.

39:56.792 --> 39:59.876
They want Danko. Want him in a big way.
So I told them that

40:00.001 --> 40:01.959
we'd put him on a plane
as soon as possible.

40:05.167 --> 40:06.542
Please be seated, captain.

40:07.459 --> 40:08.834
You've met Lieutenant Stobbs?

40:09.626 --> 40:11.866
Stobbs is the point man
in this investigation.

40:12.084 --> 40:15.167
We met. I'd like
to run this by you, captain.

40:19.209 --> 40:22.751
Viktor Rosta. Full name,
Viktor Sedgavich Rostavili.

40:22.876 --> 40:26.709
Born September 4, 1944. Georgia, Russia.

40:27.292 --> 40:30.334
His father had the distinction
of being hanged by the USSR

40:30.459 --> 40:32.376
for the crime of brigandage.

40:33.626 --> 40:34.876
Brigandage?

40:36.917 --> 40:39.001
Burning villages, raping women.

40:40.292 --> 40:42.542
That sort of thing goes on in Russia, huh?

40:42.792 --> 40:45.876
In past, during war. Not now.

40:46.584 --> 40:48.917
Hm-mmm. According to you.
According to this,

40:49.042 --> 40:53.084
Viktor spent three years in the army
and six on a forced labor camp

40:53.209 --> 40:56.917
for drug offenses.
Is currently wanted in the USSR

40:57.042 --> 41:03.042
on the charges of murder, kidnapping,
rape, extortion, currency speculation

41:03.167 --> 41:04.584
and drug dealing.

41:05.834 --> 41:07.459
Where did you get this information?

41:08.042 --> 41:10.962
Your boys in Washington
have decided to be incredibly cooperative

41:11.084 --> 41:14.501
since Viktor split.
In fact, they got a whole new attitude.

41:14.709 --> 41:17.334
I hear they're sending over
some caviar later.

41:21.126 --> 41:22.959
Why didn't you tell us this before?

41:23.292 --> 41:25.542
- I had no authorization.
- Bullshit.

41:27.209 --> 41:29.876
My government does not like
to do laundry in public.

41:30.792 --> 41:33.084
Is there anything else
we should know about?

41:34.292 --> 41:36.792
I will not leave this country
without Viktor.

41:38.667 --> 41:39.876
I need cooperation.

41:43.126 --> 41:44.251
Okay.

41:45.501 --> 41:46.917
You wanna stick around

41:47.417 --> 41:50.792
and find Viktor, captain,
that's, uh, fine by me.

41:54.042 --> 41:55.442
One more thing, captain.

41:56.209 --> 41:57.769
I don't want the press to get near you.

41:58.459 --> 42:01.334
And I don't want you rolling
through this town like the Red Army.

42:06.709 --> 42:08.001
Have you wigged out?

42:08.876 --> 42:12.292
Danko is the perfect weapon, Charlie:
A loose cannon.

42:13.209 --> 42:15.209
If he helps us find Viktor Rosta, great.

42:16.167 --> 42:19.959
If he screws up, breaks rules
along the way, he's a Russian.

42:20.084 --> 42:23.459
- Hmm, but what about Ridzik?
- Ridzik is a good cop.

42:23.584 --> 42:25.042
And a total expert at fucking up.

42:26.876 --> 42:30.334
Departmentally speaking,
I got no downside here.

42:31.459 --> 42:34.709
I have them bringing Gallagher's snitch,
the guy who helped us with the bust

42:34.834 --> 42:36.376
on the cleanheads the other day.

42:36.501 --> 42:38.584
- Excuse me.
- He's a sleazy shit,

42:38.876 --> 42:40.060
but if we can get him to talk,

42:40.084 --> 42:42.667
I think he can tell us
who's brokering the cleanheads deal.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.584
This man visits Viktor in jail?

42:44.709 --> 42:46.209
Only two folks had that honor:

42:46.542 --> 42:49.959
A skirt named Cat Manzetti
and, uh, that Russian I shot.

42:50.084 --> 42:53.001
All right now, the girl teaches dance
in Wicker Park for the city.

42:53.126 --> 42:55.686
We're gonna try to catch up with her
later on tonight, all right?

42:56.501 --> 42:58.876
About this pile of shit pimp in here.

42:59.001 --> 43:02.542
In this country, we try
to protect the rights of individuals.

43:02.667 --> 43:06.876
It's called the Miranda Act, and it says
that you can't even touch his ass.

43:07.001 --> 43:10.292
I do not want to touch his ass.
I want to make him talk.

43:12.417 --> 43:13.697
I'm gonna handle this one, okay?

43:22.042 --> 43:23.167
Hey, Streak.

43:23.709 --> 43:26.292
- You can't hold me here, dickweed.
- Oh! Hostility.

43:26.417 --> 43:28.209
You got nothing on me.
This is all bullshit!

43:28.334 --> 43:30.459
- Hey, easy.
- Where is Viktor?

43:30.584 --> 43:33.584
Hey. What the fuck are you doing?
Will you be civilized?

43:33.709 --> 43:35.102
I don't know who the fuck he thinks he is.

43:35.126 --> 43:36.393
I'll have both your fucking badges

43:36.417 --> 43:38.251
- for brutality.
- Easy, easy, easy, Streak.

43:38.376 --> 43:39.834
Just sit down and relax.

43:40.751 --> 43:43.626
Now, we wanna ask you
a couple questions about the cleanheads.

43:44.084 --> 43:45.626
Fair price for services rendered?

43:46.667 --> 43:48.167
Capitalism works, right, Streak?

43:49.251 --> 43:53.751
Cleanheads got a monster deal going down.
I told Gallagher. End of story.

43:53.876 --> 43:54.917
He lies.

43:55.834 --> 43:57.709
In this country,
he has that God-given right.

44:02.459 --> 44:03.584
Do I smell heroin?

44:05.084 --> 44:07.001
- What's this?
- Come on, man.

44:07.126 --> 44:09.185
- You bring this into the police station?
- Wait a fucking minute.

44:09.209 --> 44:11.792
- You planted that.
- Hey, that's disrespectful, you know that?

44:11.917 --> 44:14.084
- This is distribution weight.
- Fucking cop setup.

44:14.209 --> 44:16.435
You're fired, asshole.
You know who I got on retainer?

44:16.459 --> 44:18.376
Cleanheads deal: Who, when and where?

44:18.501 --> 44:21.209
The lawyer I got makes ACLU
look like Nazis.

44:21.417 --> 44:25.001
He lives for cop misconduct like this.
Probably sue you for fucking free.

44:25.126 --> 44:27.126
- Yeah?
- And I ain't telling you shit.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.917
Jesus! Oh, shit! Okay!

44:33.459 --> 44:35.417
Abdul Elijah's running the deal
from Joliet.

44:35.542 --> 44:37.917
Shit's coming in in a couple of days.
I don't know where.

44:38.042 --> 44:40.834
I swear on my balls,
I don't know where.

44:46.959 --> 44:48.959
Soviet method is more economical.

44:50.626 --> 44:54.209
I'm so glad I took the time
to explain to you an individual's rights.

44:57.292 --> 44:58.292
Streak.

45:00.167 --> 45:01.209
Sorry about that hand.

45:01.709 --> 45:04.709
You gotta watch these doorjambs.
They're dangerous.

45:07.167 --> 45:09.167
Breaking his goddamn fingers
right in front of me.

45:09.292 --> 45:12.251
You can't pull a stunt like that.
You fucking ignored me.

45:12.376 --> 45:13.834
- Miranda?
- Yes, Miranda.

45:13.959 --> 45:16.501
In your country,
it's okay to lie and put drug in pocket?

45:16.626 --> 45:18.459
Okay, okay, no, not really.

45:19.167 --> 45:21.367
Okay, maybe I was a little
out of line there, all right?

45:21.917 --> 45:23.997
But I was just trying
to get him to talk, that's all.

45:24.042 --> 45:26.282
I mean, I wasn't gonna prosecute the guy
for Christ sake.

45:26.459 --> 45:27.751
We both go too far.

45:28.209 --> 45:29.751
Shit. All I know

45:30.167 --> 45:32.501
is Gallagher's dead,
your Russian's on the loose somewhere,

45:32.626 --> 45:34.834
and I gotta chauffeur you around
all goddamn day.

45:35.501 --> 45:36.626
You know, it really sucks.

45:37.626 --> 45:39.292
Who is Abdul Elijah?

45:40.376 --> 45:43.959
He's got one of the biggest
criminal organizations going right now.

45:44.292 --> 45:46.792
- Where can we find him?
- In jail.

45:47.334 --> 45:48.959
Miranda Law is there?

45:49.542 --> 45:51.417
Yes. Miranda is there.

45:51.959 --> 45:54.542
Even scumbags have rights
in this country. I told you.

45:55.042 --> 45:56.209
In Soviet Union,

45:56.334 --> 45:59.417
only after two days
can scumbag talk to lawyer.

46:00.084 --> 46:01.376
You're shitting me.

46:01.917 --> 46:03.292
I am not shitting on you.

46:04.459 --> 46:06.084
We go see Abdul?

46:06.209 --> 46:07.959
- Yes?
- Sure. Whatever you say, Gumby.

46:09.042 --> 46:10.042
I'm your escort.

46:13.209 --> 46:15.129
That suit's not gonna explode
or anything, is it?

46:15.209 --> 46:17.001
- I think you're safe.
- Just checking.

46:18.251 --> 46:21.209
Once I lock one of these fuckers up,
the gangs take over.

46:21.667 --> 46:24.542
You got the Aryan brotherhood,
the cleanheads, the Muslims.

46:25.167 --> 46:27.251
Since most of these convicts
are repeaters,

46:28.209 --> 46:29.929
gang leader's got connection
to the outside.

46:30.042 --> 46:31.459
Big criminal operation.

46:40.084 --> 46:41.364
Cleanheads' playground.

46:42.001 --> 46:43.292
From now on, you're on your own.

46:44.209 --> 46:45.334
Thanks.

46:47.126 --> 46:49.751
There he is. Abdul Elijah.

46:49.876 --> 46:51.436
Sitting on his throne with his cronies.

46:51.542 --> 46:54.042
He makes them all shave their heads
to prove their obedience.

46:54.792 --> 46:56.632
I guess the rules are different
for the bosses.

46:58.084 --> 46:59.684
Kind of like your government, huh, Ivan?

47:00.834 --> 47:02.042
Come here, you.

47:02.251 --> 47:03.501
I wanna talk to you.

47:04.876 --> 47:06.251
This is Captain Ivan Danko.

47:06.376 --> 47:08.856
He's come all the way from Russia
to speak to your scoutmaster.

47:08.959 --> 47:11.292
Well, that's nice,
but who the fuck are you?

47:11.709 --> 47:14.959
These men have no respect
of our authority as police officers.

47:15.459 --> 47:16.584
No shit.

47:17.001 --> 47:20.834
Revolutionary political leaders,
like myself, are incarcerated

47:20.959 --> 47:24.167
- to keep us quiet.
- What is your political crime?

47:25.292 --> 47:26.626
I robbed a bank.

47:27.917 --> 47:31.042
Now, let's get to it, Mr. Moscow.
What is it you want?

47:32.292 --> 47:35.292
- I have Viktor's key.
- If that's true, then you also have

47:35.417 --> 47:38.251
Viktor's money, and all you need
is half a hundred dollar bill

47:38.376 --> 47:40.542
then you and me are in business.

47:40.959 --> 47:42.084
I give you key,

47:42.209 --> 47:43.459
you give me Viktor.

47:44.751 --> 47:46.292
That isn't ethical.

47:48.501 --> 47:49.584
You keep cocaine.

47:52.001 --> 47:57.042
Man. You're trying to make me
compromise my principles.

47:57.667 --> 47:59.542
We are not like American police.

48:00.084 --> 48:04.209
You ship drugs to my country,
and one morning you will wake up

48:04.417 --> 48:08.084
and find your testicles floating
in jars of water next to your bed.

48:08.584 --> 48:12.376
I'm a holy man.
I got no need for testicles.

48:13.209 --> 48:15.167
Then I settle for your eyes.

48:16.792 --> 48:19.417
You can't threaten me, white boy.

48:23.667 --> 48:27.459
You want to know what my crime is?
My crime was being born.

48:27.876 --> 48:31.542
I'm 38 years old
and I've been locked up 26 of those.

48:31.751 --> 48:35.126
I educated myself in here.
And I've come to understand

48:35.251 --> 48:38.459
that this country was built
on exploiting the black man.

48:39.376 --> 48:42.542
Of course, I don't hear anything
about brothers in your country.

48:43.126 --> 48:45.459
But your country
exploits its own people just the same.

48:45.584 --> 48:49.584
So I guess that makes me
the only Marxist around here,

48:50.376 --> 48:51.876
right, comrade?

48:52.459 --> 48:57.167
You see, this ain't just no drug deal.
This is politics, baby. This is economics.

48:57.292 --> 48:58.542
This is spiritual.

48:59.417 --> 49:04.751
I plan to sell drugs to every white man
in the world...

49:05.542 --> 49:06.792
and his sister.

49:10.834 --> 49:14.667
- I still want Viktor Rosta.
- Yeah, real bad. I can tell.

49:14.876 --> 49:19.167
- Where can I find him?
- I tell you what I am gonna do, captain.

49:21.126 --> 49:23.042
I'm gonna put
you two white boys together,

49:23.167 --> 49:25.251
see if you can't work this thing out.

49:26.001 --> 49:27.292
I need Viktor.

49:27.626 --> 49:28.876
And he needs that key.

49:30.251 --> 49:31.459
And you...

49:33.209 --> 49:36.751
You're just another motherfucker
we gonna have to deal with.

49:39.709 --> 49:40.792
Be cool.

49:53.417 --> 49:56.917
- Okay, so tell me. How did it go?
- Fine.

49:57.459 --> 49:58.667
Fine?

49:58.792 --> 50:00.167
All right. You wanna cut the shit?

50:00.292 --> 50:03.459
You were talking to that jazzbo so long,
I thought about having my head shaved.

50:05.459 --> 50:06.626
Could be a good idea.

50:09.667 --> 50:11.792
- What's that?
- My watch.

50:12.001 --> 50:14.792
- It's on Moscow time.
- Time to pick up Pokey?

50:15.626 --> 50:17.792
- Time to feed parakeet.
- What's that?

50:17.917 --> 50:19.542
Russian for jerking off?

50:22.876 --> 50:24.167
I guess not.

50:24.292 --> 50:25.584
What's wrong with parakeet?

50:25.792 --> 50:27.952
Nothing. I didn't say
anything was wrong with parakeet.

50:28.417 --> 50:30.084
My kid sister used to have a parakeet.

50:30.542 --> 50:32.959
You want a parakeet,
it's okay with me. I don't give a shit.

50:33.376 --> 50:35.084
You think that parakeet is feminine?

50:35.959 --> 50:38.501
Did I say that? I didn't say that, did I?

50:39.542 --> 50:41.462
What the hell do I know?
I guess it's okay.

50:42.251 --> 50:44.709
- Christ, it's fine.
- Thank you.

50:44.834 --> 50:46.474
You're welcome.

50:46.792 --> 50:50.667
Slow and fast.
One, two, three, four,

50:50.792 --> 50:56.459
five, six, seven, hips.
One, two, three and four, five, six. Easy.

50:56.584 --> 50:58.834
One, two. Whoo! Wham. Bam.

51:00.459 --> 51:04.001
One, two, smooth, five, six.

51:07.042 --> 51:09.709
Okay, that's great. That's fine.

51:16.751 --> 51:20.209
You mind showing me some ID?
I like to know who I'm talking to.

51:21.001 --> 51:24.959
Ridzik, Arthur, Detective Sergeant.
This is Captain Danko. He's from Moscow.

51:25.417 --> 51:27.537
Now, look, you went to see
Viktor Rosta in jail.

51:27.584 --> 51:29.209
- What did you talk about?
- The weather,

51:29.334 --> 51:30.834
taxes, inflation.

51:30.959 --> 51:33.001
So did you meet him
hanging around a hotel bar?

51:33.126 --> 51:34.876
You probably worked the lobbies, right?

51:35.501 --> 51:36.667
Fuck you.

51:36.792 --> 51:39.126
No thank you, I have a headache
and good taste.

51:39.334 --> 51:40.792
I don't have to listen to this shit.

51:43.167 --> 51:46.459
It's very important.
Many people could be hurt.

51:50.626 --> 51:51.751
Shit.

51:52.667 --> 51:54.042
It's really no big deal.

51:54.709 --> 51:56.629
He told me to go to The Garvin,
get his old room,

51:56.709 --> 51:58.126
told me exactly where to look.

51:58.584 --> 52:01.501
It was just a passport
and this hundred-dollar bill torn in half.

52:02.167 --> 52:05.292
I gave the stuff to a friend
of Viktor's. I don't even know his name.

52:05.667 --> 52:08.876
Oh, cut the shit, will you?
Just tell me where he's at.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.268
- I don't know.
- Got a phone number?

52:10.292 --> 52:14.626
- I lost it.
- Look, this Viktor's a very bad guy.

52:14.917 --> 52:17.042
- Really?
- Yeah, really. A cop died because of him.

52:17.167 --> 52:18.501
I don't know anything about it.

52:18.626 --> 52:20.386
Yeah? You know anything
about 11th and State?

52:20.417 --> 52:23.060
Maybe I'll take you down there
and book you for accessory to a murder.

52:23.084 --> 52:24.292
Are you trying to scare me?

52:24.417 --> 52:26.560
No. I'm just trying to figure out
why you're trying to help him.

52:26.584 --> 52:27.751
He's my husband.

52:33.126 --> 52:35.542
I'm gonna bust that bitch so hard
she bounces.

52:36.876 --> 52:40.417
Wait. We can use her to find Viktor.

52:42.417 --> 52:45.709
Oh. You got all the ideas.
Maybe I'll just go home and whack off.

52:46.459 --> 52:48.709
You know, watch old crime stories,
get some tips.

52:50.042 --> 52:54.167
Viktor uses fake name, marries American
to get travel visa to United States.

52:54.292 --> 52:57.709
All right. Why do I get the feeling
that you're taking this so personal?

52:58.042 --> 53:00.542
I shot his brother
six months ago in Moscow.

53:01.209 --> 53:02.709
- Shot him dead?
- Yes.

53:03.042 --> 53:04.626
- Way to go.
- Thank you.

53:04.751 --> 53:05.876
You're welcome.

53:19.376 --> 53:20.709
Why don't we stake it out?

53:21.292 --> 53:22.977
You go to the car,
I'll go get us something to eat.

53:23.001 --> 53:24.185
Don't worry,
I'll get you something healthy.

53:24.209 --> 53:25.393
Something from all four food groups:

53:25.417 --> 53:27.626
Hamburger, French fries,
coffee and donuts.

53:27.876 --> 53:30.126
- Wait.
- What, you don't like onions?

53:30.251 --> 53:32.459
- Give me key to car.
- It's unlocked.

53:33.251 --> 53:34.834
In case she leave.

53:34.959 --> 53:37.393
Oh, no, no, no. You can't drive that car.
That's against regulations.

53:37.417 --> 53:38.459
What if you crash it?

53:38.584 --> 53:41.251
That means I gotta fill out reports
until I retire.

53:42.209 --> 53:43.626
Key.

53:47.167 --> 53:50.001
All right.
But honk if you see something.

54:20.126 --> 54:23.001
Hey, asshole. You can't park here.

54:23.126 --> 54:25.126
This is my parking place.
I live right up there.

54:25.459 --> 54:28.417
So move your piece of shit car out now
or give me 50 bucks.

54:28.792 --> 54:31.959
- I do not understand.
- Let me make it real simple, moron.

54:32.084 --> 54:34.667
You move your ass or give me 50
or I take my Pete Rose here

54:34.792 --> 54:36.292
and fucking mutilate your car.

54:37.751 --> 54:38.959
Do you know Miranda?

54:39.084 --> 54:40.667
Never heard of the bitch.

55:04.834 --> 55:08.251
- Everything okay?
- Yes, fine. No problems.

55:08.459 --> 55:10.584
What about that sack of shit
laying on the sidewalk?

55:11.126 --> 55:12.334
He lives here.

55:15.209 --> 55:16.609
You're a real beaut, you know that?

55:17.709 --> 55:19.389
I called the squad room. Guess what.

55:19.459 --> 55:21.339
Tatomovich, you know,
that bastard I shot?

55:22.167 --> 55:24.251
Well, he's pulling out of his coma
at the hospital.

55:25.626 --> 55:28.506
Why don't we just go over there
and interrogate him, bag this shit?

55:28.876 --> 55:30.334
Here she is.

55:42.376 --> 55:44.167
- Now we go.
- Wait, wait, wait!

55:44.667 --> 55:48.584
Shit! Goddamn it! Jesus Christ!
I just burned off my dick!

55:48.792 --> 55:51.376
Oh, God! Jesus!

55:51.501 --> 55:54.459
Look at the mess I made, damn it.
Now I gotta wash the car.

55:54.584 --> 55:57.917
Just wrecked a goddamn suit
and I hard-boiled my nuts.

55:58.792 --> 56:01.501
It's gonna look like I pissed
in my pants all goddamn night.

56:02.084 --> 56:05.292
Hey, hey, careful with the driving,
will you? I don't want any accidents.

56:05.626 --> 56:08.084
I'll have to fill out paperwork
for the rest of my life.

56:08.209 --> 56:10.251
I have car under control.

56:10.709 --> 56:12.001
Yeah, sure. Sure.

56:12.126 --> 56:14.143
I suppose they taught you
everything you need to know about

56:14.167 --> 56:18.251
car wrecks and the price of insurance
in your famous school in Kiev.

56:18.834 --> 56:22.501
Socialist countries,
insurance not necessary.

56:23.042 --> 56:24.792
State pays for everything.

56:25.001 --> 56:27.334
Yeah. Well, tell me something, captain.

56:28.042 --> 56:30.042
If you got such a fucking paradise
over there,

56:30.167 --> 56:33.042
how come you're up the same creek
as we are with heroin and cocaine?

56:33.417 --> 56:34.542
Chinese find way.

56:35.751 --> 56:39.501
Right after revolution,
they line up all drug dealers,

56:39.959 --> 56:43.001
all drug addicts,
take them to public square

56:43.542 --> 56:45.167
and shoot them in back of head.

56:45.501 --> 56:46.626
Never work here.

56:47.292 --> 56:49.334
Fucking politicians wouldn't go for it.

56:49.751 --> 56:50.792
Shoot them first.

56:58.709 --> 57:00.251
Christ, they're right behind us.

57:01.126 --> 57:02.417
That's the general idea.

57:42.667 --> 57:45.334
Look at this, man. We have a pro
basketball team heading toward us

57:45.667 --> 57:46.959
with guns.

57:51.251 --> 57:52.709
- Hold this.
- What's this?

57:52.959 --> 57:55.084
- It's Viktor's key.
- Okay.

57:57.126 --> 57:59.834
- Put gun away.
- What? No. Are you nuts?

58:17.709 --> 58:19.542
I'm supposed to tell you
that this is a truce

58:19.667 --> 58:21.626
arranged by somebody named Abdul.

58:21.751 --> 58:23.477
You leave your guns
with those guys over there.

58:23.501 --> 58:27.126
No way. A Chicago cop
never relinquishes his weapon.

58:28.542 --> 58:29.751
Here.

58:35.542 --> 58:37.042
You got the key?

58:37.917 --> 58:40.209
Boy, am I glad we hid that key.

58:40.334 --> 58:42.054
Good thing
we didn't bring it with us.

58:42.209 --> 58:43.876
We'd really be in deep shit.

58:47.292 --> 58:48.542
Do not waste your time.

58:50.376 --> 58:52.751
- Where is Viktor?
- We got everything under control.

58:53.167 --> 58:57.751
- Well, good. I'll be the translator.
- You got a job. You're the hostage.

58:58.876 --> 59:01.751
I'm out of here.
I've had enough of this macho shit.

59:01.876 --> 59:03.556
Great. Thank you. I'm glad you could help.

59:03.584 --> 59:06.126
Hey, I'm sorry,
but this whole thing is way past me.

59:06.459 --> 59:08.459
Honey, I understand, really.

59:11.459 --> 59:12.917
Go see Viktor.

59:13.042 --> 59:16.042
He's down that ramp over there.
You get out of hand...

59:17.376 --> 59:18.876
your friend here gonna be gone.

59:20.334 --> 59:21.834
Hear that? Hmm?

59:23.501 --> 59:24.751
Prick.

59:46.542 --> 59:52.501
Greetings, comrade.
We meet in strange places.

01:00:02.501 --> 01:00:04.935
I don't like being used as bait.
I thought Viktor wanted to see me.

01:00:04.959 --> 01:00:06.542
Viktor wants you to get in car.

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:20.626
If they let me have my gun...

01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:23.251
you would be already dead.

01:00:24.834 --> 01:00:25.959
Cigarette?

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:35.751
The people have many needs.

01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:41.376
One is law and order.
Other, entertainment.

01:00:43.626 --> 01:00:45.584
We both have our codes, Vanya.

01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:49.209
Yours, one of the state.

01:00:49.876 --> 01:00:52.709
Mine, one of thieves.

01:00:54.626 --> 01:00:56.959
We both respect courage.

01:00:57.834 --> 01:01:00.626
We even hold our own lives in contempt.

01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:04.167
You have contempt for all life.

01:01:06.751 --> 01:01:08.292
You don't, huh?

01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:10.084
You killed my friend.

01:01:12.626 --> 01:01:14.834
You killed my brother.

01:01:15.126 --> 01:01:17.167
Your brother was criminal.

01:01:19.084 --> 01:01:20.792
A dead man is a dead man.

01:01:22.459 --> 01:01:26.209
After 70 years,
the doors begin to open in Moskva.

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:30.376
Our first taste of freedom
will be cut with cocaine.

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:35.042
Any country that can survive Stalin,
can certainly handle a little dope.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.667
I think you should come off
your high horse, captain,

01:01:39.792 --> 01:01:42.042
and start to talk business.

01:01:43.209 --> 01:01:45.751
You have my key.

01:01:46.584 --> 01:01:48.334
I need it quite badly.

01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:54.001
I'm willing to pay for it, generously.
More than you can make in ten years.

01:01:54.126 --> 01:01:55.834
I do not sell drugs.

01:02:01.126 --> 01:02:02.542
Foolish.

01:02:04.626 --> 01:02:07.542
You are so foolish.

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:14.459
I thought you might be more reasonable.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:18.542
Money has a way
of doing that to a man, but no.

01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:20.751
I don't think so.

01:02:21.709 --> 01:02:22.751
Not with you.

01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:28.334
You are one of those kinds of Soviets
that only look forward to death.

01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:32.834
I know you well, Vanya.

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:38.542
Without me,
you don't even exist.

01:02:54.459 --> 01:02:57.376
I don't give a shit if they did
give us the fucking guns back!

01:02:57.667 --> 01:03:00.667
These are the motherfuckers
that killed Gallagher, you know that?

01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:04.209
And you call yourself a fucking cop.
You know, in this country,

01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:06.209
we trust our partners.

01:03:06.751 --> 01:03:12.709
We don't hold back from our partners,
and we never leave our partners

01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:15.292
holding their dicks in their hands

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:19.376
while some bald motherfucker's
got a gun in his ear.

01:03:20.501 --> 01:03:23.417
Here. Here.
Take this goddamn key. Take it.

01:03:24.292 --> 01:03:27.876
Now we go to hospital
to question Tatomovich.

01:03:28.001 --> 01:03:30.209
You are a shithead.

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:34.334
Yes, third floor.

01:03:34.459 --> 01:03:35.619
We're here to see Tatomovich.

01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:37.389
Yeah,
I got him right over here.

01:03:37.709 --> 01:03:39.542
No, this is not part of our deal.
I've had...

01:04:19.876 --> 01:04:21.251
What is his condition?

01:04:21.376 --> 01:04:23.685
Well, he started coming around
about an hour or so ago,

01:04:23.709 --> 01:04:25.667
you know, mumbling something in Russian.

01:04:26.001 --> 01:04:28.042
They got a nurse in there
with him right now.

01:04:29.751 --> 01:04:31.018
Any visitors from downtown?

01:04:31.042 --> 01:04:33.126
Not so far,
but they're on the way.

01:04:33.417 --> 01:04:35.297
Yeah, you'd better wait
for Stobbs and Donnelly.

01:04:35.376 --> 01:04:37.626
- Ernie, let's get some coffee.
- Sure, okay.

01:04:42.251 --> 01:04:44.584
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:47.084
Check it out.

01:04:47.459 --> 01:04:49.167
I knew I should have been a doctor.

01:04:50.376 --> 01:04:52.584
Hey, this area's restrict...

01:04:55.084 --> 01:04:57.334
Hey, buddy. Hey, shithead.

01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:00.517
You talk to him. You speak his language.

01:05:00.834 --> 01:05:03.751
Tatomovich.

01:05:04.792 --> 01:05:06.292
Come on, scumbag, don't play dead.

01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:15.626
The nurse.

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.251
Hey!

01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:27.001
Hey.

01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:56.417
Hey.

01:06:00.167 --> 01:06:01.334
Hey!

01:06:04.334 --> 01:06:05.626
Shit. Look out.

01:06:08.376 --> 01:06:10.126
Goddamn it, lady, police!

01:06:10.251 --> 01:06:11.834
Stop, goddamn it, or I'll shoot.

01:06:12.126 --> 01:06:14.477
- Don't! Don't shoot her. Put it down.
- What are you doing here?

01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:16.876
- Put it down. Are you crazy?
- Move, goddamn it.

01:06:17.001 --> 01:06:18.935
- Put it down. Goddamn it.
- Get the fuck out of the way. Goddamn it.

01:06:18.959 --> 01:06:20.626
- Move. Move.
- Oh, God, no.

01:06:24.584 --> 01:06:26.126
Don't! Stop it!

01:06:27.792 --> 01:06:29.084
You...

01:07:19.292 --> 01:07:21.626
What the hell? It was a guy.

01:07:33.209 --> 01:07:34.334
Shit.

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:38.292
You are stupid.

01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:43.167
- I never meant for any of this...
- Viktor has ten women like you at home.

01:07:44.209 --> 01:07:45.917
They're all dead or in prison.

01:07:47.917 --> 01:07:49.084
What am I supposed to do?

01:07:57.709 --> 01:07:59.959
Go. Go.

01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:11.126
I just don't see how she can
disappear into thin air.

01:08:11.459 --> 01:08:13.959
- You checked the back stairs?
- Yes.

01:08:14.376 --> 01:08:16.084
- No sign of her?
- Yes.

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:18.667
- She just got away?
- Yes.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:22.959
- Nice work, Gumby.
- Thank you.

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.792
- I didn't mean that.
- I know.

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:28.376
- You got a shithouse in Russia?
- Yes.

01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:30.901
Well, we got one here
and you and I are standing right in it.

01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:34.291
And it's not only gonna hit the fan,
it's gonna go right through the ceiling.

01:08:34.626 --> 01:08:35.917
Watch it. Watch it, lady, okay?

01:08:36.042 --> 01:08:37.810
I don't know why you're insisting
on this tetanus shot.

01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:40.667
I had one 14 years ago. Easy.

01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:44.542
Shit, bitch.

01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:47.876
What's in that, cement?

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.709
All right, what's the score, Ridzik?

01:08:52.209 --> 01:08:54.667
Oh shit, it's been
a hell of a night, commander.

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:58.876
First of all, some cleanhead
stuck his damn gun in my ear.

01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:03.251
- And Danko here shot a drag queen.
- I've always enjoyed your reports, Ridzik.

01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:05.194
I'm especially gonna enjoy the one

01:09:05.292 --> 01:09:08.292
where you detail your cross examination
of Gallagher's informant.

01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:09.727
- Streak?
- According to his lawyer

01:09:09.751 --> 01:09:11.227
- you tried to break his hand.
- What?

01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:14.167
And he's now filing a criminal
and civil suit against the department.

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:16.209
Oh. Well, it's bullshit.

01:09:16.334 --> 01:09:17.626
We can beat that rap.

01:09:17.834 --> 01:09:20.435
He got his hand stuck in the door.
Danko was there. He'll tell you.

01:09:20.459 --> 01:09:24.501
Listen, the story is, after silencing
the alarm button on the EKG monitor,

01:09:24.626 --> 01:09:27.876
el transvesto killed Tatomovich
by shooting an air bubble into a vein.

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:29.876
He obviously didn't want us
to question him.

01:09:30.001 --> 01:09:32.459
Viktor did not want me
to question him.

01:09:32.584 --> 01:09:36.584
- The drag queen belongs to Viktor?
- Yes. He killed his own man.

01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:39.001
He knew I would get information
from Tatomovich.

01:09:39.834 --> 01:09:41.334
He thinks it's better to kill him.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:43.462
Well, did you get to his wife?
This, uh,

01:09:43.584 --> 01:09:46.224
Manzetti woman? We've been
trying to track her down all night long.

01:09:49.584 --> 01:09:50.917
No, we don't have shit.

01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:01.792
Tell me, captain.
Where did you get the gun you used?

01:10:01.917 --> 01:10:05.126
Registered in my name.
Moscow Militia Headquarters.

01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:07.917
- Ridzik.
- Yeah.

01:10:08.584 --> 01:10:10.001
He did not know about gun.

01:10:11.417 --> 01:10:14.185
Under the circumstances,
I'm gonna have to ask for your weapon.

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.292
And I say no.

01:10:16.042 --> 01:10:18.501
I see Ridzik is teaching you
his sense of humor.

01:10:18.751 --> 01:10:22.917
Your gun, captain. Now.
Don't fuck with me.

01:10:42.501 --> 01:10:45.417
Sergeant, I need to see
paperwork on this whole incident

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:47.001
by ten o'clock this morning.

01:10:47.459 --> 01:10:49.376
Every move you and Danko have made.

01:10:49.626 --> 01:10:50.751
You'll have it.

01:10:51.834 --> 01:10:53.352
Where did you put
the witnesses?

01:10:53.376 --> 01:10:55.167
Got them right down the hall, sir.

01:10:56.376 --> 01:10:57.542
I need other gun.

01:10:58.459 --> 01:11:01.459
Get away from me, man. Just get away
from me. I can't deal with that.

01:11:01.584 --> 01:11:04.209
Look, we got no leads, pal.
We're batting fucking zero.

01:11:04.334 --> 01:11:05.959
Don't even look at me like that.

01:11:06.084 --> 01:11:07.459
It's not happening.

01:11:07.751 --> 01:11:10.417
I mean, I give you a gun,
my ass is grass. You understand?

01:11:11.459 --> 01:11:14.501
Donnelly wants me for dog meat,
so forget it.

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:17.209
Just get in the car and relax.

01:11:21.626 --> 01:11:25.001
We have many men
like Commander Donnelly in Soviet Union.

01:11:26.459 --> 01:11:30.292
I understand him. He's like KGB.

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:36.251
All right, goddamn it.

01:11:39.834 --> 01:11:42.194
All right, I owe you one,
because you saved my life tonight.

01:11:44.417 --> 01:11:45.501
Here.

01:11:46.251 --> 01:11:51.667
Captain Danko, you are now the proud owner
of the most powerful handgun in the world.

01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:55.667
Soviet Podbyrin 9.2 mm

01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:58.251
is world's most powerful handgun.

01:11:58.501 --> 01:12:01.417
Come on, everyone knows the Magnum.44
is the big boy on the block.

01:12:02.126 --> 01:12:03.667
Why do you think Dirty Harry uses it?

01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:08.917
Who is Dirty Harry?

01:12:15.167 --> 01:12:16.834
Well, you got your site report,

01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:18.084
your preliminary report.

01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:19.959
You got your accident report.

01:12:20.084 --> 01:12:22.209
You got a questionnaire
from the coroner to fill out,

01:12:23.042 --> 01:12:25.167
which has to be typed in triplicate.

01:12:25.376 --> 01:12:26.685
How are you two fellows doing?

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:29.209
Great. Just had my ass jammed
with a horse needle.

01:12:29.334 --> 01:12:30.459
Poor baby.

01:12:31.626 --> 01:12:34.751
Look, lady, I just got my coffee
the perfect color.

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:37.091
It's the only thing
I got going for me tonight.

01:12:39.292 --> 01:12:40.292
You married?

01:12:42.542 --> 01:12:44.502
I'm just curious.
I mean, we are working together.

01:12:45.209 --> 01:12:46.959
- No.
- Ever?

01:12:48.209 --> 01:12:49.292
No.

01:12:50.084 --> 01:12:52.126
- You got a girlfriend?
- No.

01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:55.292
- Ever?
- Of course.

01:12:56.667 --> 01:12:57.959
Great. That's good to hear.

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.644
How about your dad? What was he, a cop?

01:13:05.126 --> 01:13:07.834
Army. Dead 11 years.

01:13:10.626 --> 01:13:15.001
- How about your ma?
- Nurse. Died when I was young.

01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:19.584
- Grandparents?
- Killed in war against Nazis.

01:13:22.376 --> 01:13:23.376
Pretty fucking grim.

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.959
- You got any brothers or sisters?
- No.

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:31.876
You?

01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:35.209
Oh yeah, I got one sister. Divorced.
Parents are both dead.

01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:39.292
My dad was a cop. A real good cop.

01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:42.102
I guess you and I
won't spend a lot of time

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:43.486
Christmas shopping this year, huh?

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:47.787
You don't like talking about
this stuff, do you?

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:51.042
I didn't think so.

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:55.709
Yo, sweet cheeks. While we're young, huh?

01:14:00.084 --> 01:14:01.167
Tea, please.

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:04.292
Uh, in a glass with lemon.

01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:08.084
- Right?
- Yes.

01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:11.667
I saw Dr. Zhivago.

01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:30.852
All right. Look, I'm gonna go back
to the station house.

01:14:30.876 --> 01:14:32.876
You catch a couple Z's
and take a shower, will you?

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:34.727
We'll get back to it in a couple hours.

01:14:44.792 --> 01:14:46.042
Hey, you're all wet.

01:14:46.584 --> 01:14:47.751
Messages.

01:14:49.126 --> 01:14:50.501
I'm just trying to be friendly.

01:14:52.292 --> 01:14:54.042
Oh yeah, you got
a whole mess of them here.

01:14:54.167 --> 01:14:55.417
All from the same honey too.

01:14:55.542 --> 01:14:57.834
Been calling every ten minutes
the last hour.

01:15:02.917 --> 01:15:05.917
Hey, buddy, I got an idea.
Why don't you just use my phone, okay?

01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:07.792
Just make sure it's a local, will you?

01:15:11.292 --> 01:15:13.376
Yeah.

01:15:13.501 --> 01:15:14.667
<i>This is Danko.</i>

01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:17.292
Yeah, look,
I can't be in the middle of this.

01:15:17.834 --> 01:15:20.001
If Viktor finds out,
you guys gotta promise that you'll

01:15:20.126 --> 01:15:22.251
<i>protect me.
Look, the drugs are coming in tonight.</i>

01:15:22.376 --> 01:15:24.001
<i>I give you Viktor, you let me walk.</i>

01:15:25.959 --> 01:15:27.376
I do not understand.

01:15:27.501 --> 01:15:28.709
You know exactly what I mean.

01:15:28.834 --> 01:15:31.042
You get Viktor, I go free.
You understand "freedom"?

01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:34.209
Look, I just want my life back.

01:15:35.042 --> 01:15:37.251
The city pays me $5.84 an hour
to teach kids to dance

01:15:37.376 --> 01:15:38.736
they hope won't turn into junkies.

01:15:38.792 --> 01:15:41.272
Viktor gives me ten grand
just to marry him. You figure it out.

01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:43.959
Look, he's gonna contact me.

01:15:44.751 --> 01:15:47.711
I find out when and where this big
drug deal's going down. I tell you guys.

01:15:47.792 --> 01:15:48.935
<i>Why would he tell you?</i>

01:15:48.959 --> 01:15:50.667
He trusts me. I'm his wife.

01:15:53.084 --> 01:15:55.792
Come on, Danko. Don't just breathe at me.

01:15:57.209 --> 01:15:58.417
I get Viktor,

01:15:58.542 --> 01:16:00.417
<i>I promise I do what I can to help.</i>

01:16:16.376 --> 01:16:17.776
<i>Shit, don't put it over here.</i>

01:16:19.626 --> 01:16:20.959
<i>There. Get it?</i>

01:16:30.292 --> 01:16:31.501
Come on, what's bugging you?

01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:33.209
What do you think?

01:16:33.334 --> 01:16:35.734
Check your messages, Art.
Your phone's been driving me crazy.

01:16:44.126 --> 01:16:46.084
<i>Yeah, uh, Ridzik,
Nelligan here.</i>

01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:49.251
<i>Listen, that 560 report,
please get it done tonight.</i>

01:16:49.376 --> 01:16:51.126
<i>It's got to be in by morning.</i>

01:16:51.667 --> 01:16:54.027
<i>Yo, Art, this is Pat,
your millionaire brother-in-law.</i>

01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:56.376
<i>Yo, hey, pay attention to me.</i>

01:16:57.126 --> 01:16:59.584
<i>This alimony business
with your sister is getting out of hand.</i>

01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:01.956
<i>We gotta talk. I'll be at the key shop
later tonight.</i>

01:17:58.376 --> 01:17:59.417
Hi, guys.

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:04.667
How you doing?

01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:07.501
Hey, you, uh...

01:18:09.042 --> 01:18:10.376
You want your old room back?

01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:05.912
<i>Okay, we're ready for our next case.</i>

01:19:06.001 --> 01:19:09.376
<i>So, Mr. Bennet,
please introduce our new couple.</i>

01:19:09.584 --> 01:19:12.417
<i>Your Honor, this is the case
of Antonello v. Antonello.</i>

01:19:12.626 --> 01:19:15.292
<i>Ben Antonello
is a 27-year-old police officer.</i>

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.751
<i>Roxanne Antonello is 23 and works at...</i>

01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:24.292
<i>Roxanne says Ben
keeps pulling it up,</i>

01:19:24.417 --> 01:19:26.584
<i>and she has the key to pushing it down.</i>

01:19:27.376 --> 01:19:28.376
Three-oh-two.

01:19:45.251 --> 01:19:47.091
<i>You shop full-time, then?</i>

01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:49.334
<i>As a matter of fact, I do.</i>

01:19:50.626 --> 01:19:52.167
<i>Roxanne, why...</i>

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:56.376
Where is he?

01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:58.459
He's in the bathroom.

01:20:19.001 --> 01:20:20.251
Wrong guy.

01:20:20.792 --> 01:20:21.917
Viktor set us up.

01:20:40.042 --> 01:20:41.334
It's him.

01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:43.626
No. Not me. I'm not with them.
I don't know anything about this shit.

01:21:43.876 --> 01:21:46.042
- I just wanna get out of here.
- How many more?

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:48.834
I don't know. They just came in
and blew my trick away.

01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:51.514
I don't know anything about this.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:54.834
Viktor.

01:21:57.084 --> 01:21:58.792
Hey, wait a minute.

01:22:06.751 --> 01:22:09.584
I don't believe this.
What is this all about?

01:22:13.876 --> 01:22:15.236
Hey, where are you going?

01:22:17.959 --> 01:22:19.834
You're not gonna start shooting again,
are you?

01:22:25.834 --> 01:22:27.501
What's in there?

01:22:33.334 --> 01:22:34.574
What are you gonna do?

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:37.751
Let's get out of here. Oh, God.

01:22:42.084 --> 01:22:43.417
Oh, God.

01:22:55.626 --> 01:22:56.959
Oh my God!

01:23:19.376 --> 01:23:20.976
Don't get any on your shoes.

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:24.102
Would you tell me who the hell's
gonna explain this to my boss, huh?

01:23:24.126 --> 01:23:27.959
That third floor looks like Beirut.
He's gonna shit bricks when he sees this.

01:23:28.084 --> 01:23:31.084
Who's gonna back me up when I tell him
that it's not my fault, huh?

01:23:31.209 --> 01:23:33.209
The city of Chicago? You cops?

01:23:33.459 --> 01:23:35.185
Yeah, somebody's gotta pay
for all this stuff

01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:39.042
and it sure as hell ain't gonna be
that fucking bastard Commie Russian.

01:23:39.167 --> 01:23:41.518
- I'm just here to get your statement.
- I don't know.

01:23:41.542 --> 01:23:43.376
I don't know about anything.

01:23:43.584 --> 01:23:46.334
- Everybody just started shooting.
- Where'd you get the gun?

01:23:46.751 --> 01:23:48.001
In my purse.

01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:51.167
I don't know nothing about any of this.

01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:55.584
- You carry a gun in your purse?
- Around here everybody's got a gun.

01:23:56.126 --> 01:23:57.917
You meet a lot of weirdos.

01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:02.501
- How many more upstairs?
- Three.

01:24:03.792 --> 01:24:06.477
There's only one thing that's clear to me
about this whole damn case.

01:24:06.501 --> 01:24:08.126
- Yeah.
- That Russian bastard

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:09.331
is still holding out on us.

01:24:09.417 --> 01:24:11.352
...<i>a young woman
found in the Chicago River tonight,</i>

01:24:11.376 --> 01:24:13.709
<i>as a Catherine "Cat" Manzetti.</i>

01:24:14.084 --> 01:24:15.792
<i>The victim was a dance instructor,</i>

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:18.376
<i>employed at Wicker Park
Performing Arts Center.</i>

01:24:18.876 --> 01:24:20.292
<i>She was 24 years old.</i>

01:24:21.001 --> 01:24:24.667
<i>The body was discovered beneath
the Kinsey Bridge by a local patrol unit.</i>

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:26.751
The cause of death
has not been determined,

01:24:26.876 --> 01:24:29.167
but foul play has not been ruled out.

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:32.501
<i>Thus far, investigators are refusing
to comment on the incident.</i>

01:24:33.292 --> 01:24:36.001
<i>Miss Manzetti was identified
by police records.</i>

01:24:36.251 --> 01:24:39.084
<i>In 1986, she was charged with pros...</i>

01:24:42.334 --> 01:24:43.454
It's Viktor's wife,

01:24:44.584 --> 01:24:47.251
Cat Manzetti. We fished her
out of the river about an hour ago.

01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:52.626
Preliminary med-path indicates
a broken neck, strangulation, the works.

01:24:54.751 --> 01:24:56.417
I want an autopsy right away.

01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:03.560
If I talk to either of them
right now, I'm gonna get a heart attack.

01:25:03.584 --> 01:25:05.584
Bring them both in,
shut them down, the end.

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:09.042
I'll interview Danko in my office later.
I want some debriefing.

01:25:10.167 --> 01:25:12.376
I was very wrong about the downside.

01:25:19.542 --> 01:25:21.876
Donnelly says
you're riding the desk starting now.

01:25:22.959 --> 01:25:25.459
We're sending you back
behind the curtain where you belong.

01:25:29.584 --> 01:25:30.626
Eat shit.

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:32.376
Excuse me?

01:25:33.959 --> 01:25:35.251
See you at the office.

01:25:43.959 --> 01:25:46.501
You stupid, goddamn, fucking Russians!

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:49.751
Don't take that personal, Danko.

01:25:50.334 --> 01:25:52.376
I didn't mean you.
I'm talking about Viktor.

01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:55.751
Except Viktor's not stupid,
because he's got the key.

01:26:04.334 --> 01:26:05.977
Okay, Art,
if you and your foreign friend

01:26:06.001 --> 01:26:08.501
wanna goosestep back here, we can talk.

01:26:08.626 --> 01:26:10.001
- These the books?
- Yeah.

01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:13.143
They're alphabetical order and they're
in English. Is that a problem for you?

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.626
- Hey, take a walk, will you?
- So what did you do, Art?

01:26:15.917 --> 01:26:17.877
Lock one of your girlfriends up
in the patrol car?

01:26:20.251 --> 01:26:21.935
Tell your greedy little sister
to stop calling me.

01:26:21.959 --> 01:26:23.727
Yeah, well, I'll give you
a pretty little tip, Pat.

01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:25.959
You pay your alimony on time
and she'll leave you alone.

01:26:26.084 --> 01:26:27.893
She said it was your idea
to go back to court.

01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:29.876
- Yeah.
- She can take me back to court,

01:26:30.001 --> 01:26:32.268
because I don't have any more money, okay?
We both agreed to the payments.

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:34.001
- Why can't she live...
- Very simple, Pat.

01:26:34.334 --> 01:26:37.709
Your May check arrived July 9th
and bounced like a superball.

01:26:37.834 --> 01:26:40.143
Well, maybe I'm doing too much free work
for the police department, huh?

01:26:40.167 --> 01:26:41.685
Yeah, maybe we should have
a pity party for Pat.

01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:43.518
Don't start with that, Art. Come on,
Pity, pity, pity, pity,

01:26:43.542 --> 01:26:44.768
- Talk to her. She'll listen to you.
- pity, pity, pity, pity.

01:26:44.792 --> 01:26:46.935
She don't listen to me. I told her
not to marry you in the first place.

01:26:46.959 --> 01:26:48.667
I offered her money
not to marry you.

01:26:48.792 --> 01:26:51.084
Oh yeah? Well, I gave her
the best six months of my life.

01:26:51.209 --> 01:26:53.334
But you know what you are?
You're cheap, man.

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:54.727
You hurt her, and you owe her money,

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:56.102
- I'm not listening to this, okay?
- and you should pay up.

01:26:56.126 --> 01:26:57.477
- I don't have to listen to this.
- You're a sleazebag.

01:26:57.501 --> 01:26:58.602
Get out of my face, onion breath.

01:26:58.626 --> 01:27:00.518
- I don't care what you got?
- If I wanted a fight I'd still be married.

01:27:00.542 --> 01:27:02.422
Hey, you pay her.

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:12.709
Find anything?

01:27:30.126 --> 01:27:31.251
Coffee.

01:27:47.376 --> 01:27:48.417
Thank you.

01:28:09.959 --> 01:28:12.626
Everything okay, yes?

01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:16.834
Sure.

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:21.751
The stuff's coming in on the 9:30
from El Paso. Check it out.

01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:24.417
I trust you.

01:28:24.751 --> 01:28:27.251
Spread it all over Siberia, right, man?

01:28:46.376 --> 01:28:48.042
All right. Let's go in.

01:28:48.834 --> 01:28:51.042
Wait a minute. Now, look,

01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:54.459
I know you really want this guy,
but this is a Chicago Police matter.

01:28:54.917 --> 01:28:56.477
You go in the front
and work your way to the rear,

01:28:56.501 --> 01:28:59.417
I'm gonna cover the back.
And don't try to be a hero.

01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:01.042
You dig?

01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:05.001
You dig? Capiche?
You understand? Dig?

01:29:05.417 --> 01:29:07.084
What, they didn't teach you that in Kiev?

01:29:07.417 --> 01:29:08.834
I'm not on holiday here.

01:29:09.792 --> 01:29:11.084
Then let's go.

01:29:32.417 --> 01:29:33.584
Excuse me.

01:29:35.084 --> 01:29:37.167
You got change for a $100 bill?

01:29:42.042 --> 01:29:43.402
This is the smallest I have.

01:29:52.292 --> 01:29:54.334
Your merchandise is in the luggage trunks.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.501
Hey.

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.667
You did not make it, Viktor.

01:30:35.042 --> 01:30:36.376
Back off, captain.

01:30:37.251 --> 01:30:40.501
He killed a Chicago police officer.
Chicago gets him first.

01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:42.584
I have my orders.

01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:44.459
What, are you fucking nuts?

01:30:46.084 --> 01:30:48.376
All right, come on,
get real, Danko.

01:30:48.959 --> 01:30:51.417
Look, we're doing good things here.
We'll take him... Move!

01:30:51.542 --> 01:30:53.209
Move!

01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:36.602
I'm not leaving yet, mister.

01:31:36.626 --> 01:31:37.751
- Get out.
- Wait a minute!

01:31:39.584 --> 01:31:40.917
Hey!

01:31:42.042 --> 01:31:43.626
Hey. Hey.

01:31:48.334 --> 01:31:50.792
- Get in.
- What were you gonna do? Leave without me?

01:31:57.417 --> 01:31:59.334
Where did you learn
to drive a bus, anyway?

01:32:00.042 --> 01:32:01.584
Kiev. In the army.

01:32:02.417 --> 01:32:04.626
Jesus, we're going down
the wrong way street.

01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:06.667
Get over on the other side of the street.

01:32:07.876 --> 01:32:10.834
Danko. Danko,
you're not listening to me.

01:32:11.584 --> 01:32:15.792
Christ. Go to the right.

01:32:22.126 --> 01:32:25.584
Way to go.
That was a fucking Chicago landmark.

01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:49.021
Where the hell are all the cops?

01:32:49.626 --> 01:32:51.810
Damn, they're never around
when you need one, you know that?

01:32:51.834 --> 01:32:56.084
You make a U-turn, and they're all over
your ass. Where the fuck are they?

01:33:10.292 --> 01:33:11.501
Watch it, watch it!

01:33:25.084 --> 01:33:26.376
Shit!

01:34:20.542 --> 01:34:23.042
Shit. You know what we call this?
This is called Chicken.

01:34:23.167 --> 01:34:24.967
But you're not supposed
to play it with buses.

01:34:25.167 --> 01:34:27.709
- This is no game.
- No shit.

01:34:31.084 --> 01:34:32.542
Get ready to swerve.

01:34:34.292 --> 01:34:35.959
Come on, get ready to swerve.

01:34:40.292 --> 01:34:43.376
Come on. You crazy fucker.

01:35:22.251 --> 01:35:25.376
You're a rock.
You're a rock. You're a rock.

01:35:25.501 --> 01:35:28.917
You're a rock! You fucker.
You almost killed both of us, goddamn it.

01:35:29.042 --> 01:35:30.292
And Viktor!

01:35:30.417 --> 01:35:32.751
- Fuck Viktor!
- Hey, man. What's wrong with you?

01:35:33.084 --> 01:35:36.126
Are you crazy?
You almost got us both killed!

01:35:36.376 --> 01:35:39.334
Jesus Christ, man! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:42.959
You son of a bitch.

01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:52.792
I take care of this.

01:36:00.917 --> 01:36:03.084
I give up. This whole thing's very Russia.

01:36:06.167 --> 01:36:09.292
Hey, Gumby. Honk if you need me.

01:36:56.834 --> 01:36:57.959
Did you get him?

01:37:01.751 --> 01:37:03.334
Nice grouping of your shots.

01:37:04.834 --> 01:37:06.334
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:37:07.084 --> 01:37:09.209
I still like Soviet model better.

01:37:13.876 --> 01:37:15.542
Got a real attitude problem, Danko.

01:37:51.584 --> 01:37:53.876
<i>High, left center.</i>

01:37:56.417 --> 01:37:58.667
I do not understand this sport.

01:37:58.792 --> 01:38:00.592
You're not supposed to.
It's totally American.

01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:03.424
You should stick to things
that you're good at.

01:38:04.209 --> 01:38:08.251
You know, like knee dancing, training
those cute little bears for the circus.

01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:11.834
We play baseball now in Soviet Union.

01:38:12.584 --> 01:38:13.709
Come on.

01:38:13.834 --> 01:38:16.459
Give me a break, will you?
You haven't got a shot.

01:38:17.292 --> 01:38:18.917
This is our national pastime.

01:38:20.001 --> 01:38:21.167
Forget it.

01:38:23.876 --> 01:38:26.209
It'd be a hell of a World Series,
though, wouldn't it?

01:38:27.292 --> 01:38:28.626
We will win.

01:38:33.084 --> 01:38:35.751
Hey, Danko, listen, I been wanting
to ask you something.

01:38:36.751 --> 01:38:39.959
Remember when we were back
at the bus station, both of us had Viktor?

01:38:40.542 --> 01:38:42.167
You turned and pointed the gun at me.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:45.596
You weren't gonna really shoot me,
were you?

01:38:51.167 --> 01:38:52.376
Yeah, that's what I figured.

01:38:54.167 --> 01:38:55.376
Just checking.

01:39:03.001 --> 01:39:08.959
It is custom in Soviet Union to exchange
article as souvenir for friendship.

01:39:10.542 --> 01:39:13.209
I decide to give you this.

01:39:14.834 --> 01:39:15.834
That's really nice.

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:18.851
Here. Here, I want you to have my watch.

01:39:20.042 --> 01:39:24.667
This here is a, uh, $1000 marvel
of Western technology.

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:27.004
I got it at, you know,
a discount from my cousin.

01:39:30.667 --> 01:39:31.876
Thanks.

01:39:32.001 --> 01:39:33.042
This is really...

01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:37.084
a $20 East German watch.

01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:43.126
Thank you.

01:39:46.042 --> 01:39:47.126
Ridzik.

01:39:49.584 --> 01:39:50.876
We are police officers...

01:39:52.584 --> 01:39:54.042
not politicians.

01:39:54.667 --> 01:39:56.126
It's okay to like each other.

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:08.376
Sorry, my Russian's a little rusty.

01:40:11.251 --> 01:40:12.376
Good luck.

01:40:14.084 --> 01:40:15.209
Farewell.
