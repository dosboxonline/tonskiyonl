00:01.436 --> 00:03.873
<i>Previously</i> <i>
on "Resident Alien"...</i>

00:03.916 --> 00:05.092
Break me out of here,
but you have to do it quick.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.310
What do you mean?

00:06.354 --> 00:07.659
Your people will send
someone else

00:07.703 --> 00:08.834
to kill everyone for you.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.053
Including Asta?

00:10.097 --> 00:12.012
You're an alien.
You know, phone home.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.926
Call them
and tell them not to come.

00:13.970 --> 00:17.365
<i>I will try to build a radio</i> <i>
to contact my people.</i>

00:17.408 --> 00:19.193
Mm.

00:19.758 --> 00:20.933
Yes!

00:20.977 --> 00:22.674
<i>Time for you two</i> <i>
to get to Colorado</i>

00:22.718 --> 00:25.982
<i>to find me whatever</i> <i>
was flying that machine.</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:29.507
Max, who is that?
Why is he wearing a white coat?

00:29.551 --> 00:32.771
- Are you the town doctor?
- Yes, I am.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.258
I remember everything,

00:41.302 --> 00:43.565
even though
I'm not supposed to.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.958
Most people don't.

00:46.002 --> 00:49.310
There were others in the ship,
you know, who were taken?

00:49.353 --> 00:52.791
Like
an intergalactic orphanage.

00:52.835 --> 00:56.447
Growing up that way
probably felt very alienating.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.364
Showed me my mom and dad
a few times.

01:00.408 --> 01:03.759
Been searching for them
ever since the aliens

01:03.802 --> 01:06.153
dumped me back here
five years ago.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.720
Then I can imagine
the complicated feelings

01:08.764 --> 01:10.548
you have for them.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.247
All that time,
all those missed opportunities.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.727
It's the missing things,
right, Doc?

01:15.771 --> 01:19.209
The missing things
are what help you heal.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.603
Attachments, like you said.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.562
Feel like I'm a single thread

01:24.606 --> 01:26.869
from blowing away
in the wind altogether.

01:28.436 --> 01:32.570
Unfortunately,
we're out of time this week.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.530
- Same time next week?

Listen up, skin bags.

03:15.456 --> 03:19.068
I have built a radio
to tell my people

03:19.111 --> 03:22.811
not to come and kill everyone,
including you.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.509
That was difficult.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.903
I am now the savior
of the human race,

03:27.946 --> 03:30.688
so you can give me
my alien ball back.

03:30.732 --> 03:34.388
I would, but I gave your ball
to my dad.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.737
He uses it to golf.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.392
You cannot golf
with that ball.

03:38.435 --> 03:41.090
Maybe you can't
because you're a bad golfer,

03:41.133 --> 03:45.050
but he got a hole in one,
and in that hole was bird poop.

03:45.094 --> 03:48.793
So now your silver alien ball
is covered in bird poop.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.535
I changed my mind.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.886
I am going to tell my people
to save everyone but you,

03:54.930 --> 03:57.715
and when you are dead,
I'm going to freeze you

03:57.759 --> 04:00.979
and make snow cones
out of your gross, dead ice

04:01.023 --> 04:04.853
and add the worst
snow cone flavor to it--papaya.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.899
That's dark.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.597
You know
what I'm gonna do to you?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.294
What could you do to me?

04:23.959 --> 04:25.395
You are a monster.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.576
You will bring me
my alien ball.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.885
You sick, broken child.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.497
That's cool.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.717
He's building a radio
to save us.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.633
Are you a goldfish?
It's not a radio.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.245
It's a bomb.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.646
<i>Humans live to consume,</i>

04:58.689 --> 05:00.735

05:27.936 --> 05:29.372
Whoo!

05:29.416 --> 05:32.593
He seems like a nice guy.
She looks happy.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.986
I am not engaging.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.641
Keeping my distance,
and you don't have to comment.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.514
It's called boundaries.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.472
Could you hypothetically
do a background check?

05:42.516 --> 05:45.519
Wait, nope. Say nothing.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.130
All right, Patience!

05:48.173 --> 05:49.349
Let's hold 'em to zero runs.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.307
That's right, zero runs

05:51.351 --> 05:52.352
on the board for Jessup.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.483
Three for Patience.

05:53.527 --> 05:56.181
Thus Patience--
better than Jessup.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.487

05:57.531 --> 06:00.098

06:02.274 --> 06:04.102

how to do a real braid.

want me to have the pitcher

so you can get a hit.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.413

or as fast as you want to go.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.075

- No way.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.296
- You're out.
- Yeah!

06:42.445 --> 06:43.881

06:43.925 --> 06:46.841
The fate of everyone on Earth
is at stake.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.191
She thinks
Harry's building a bomb.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.975
He's not. It's a radio.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.282
When somebody
shows you who they are,

06:53.325 --> 06:55.719
believe them the first time.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.808
That's pretty deep
for someone your age.

06:57.852 --> 07:01.551
It's Maya Angelou.
Dr. Maya Angelou.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.335
An actual doctor,

07:03.379 --> 07:05.860
unlike the alien
who pretended to be one.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.166
What else does
he pretend to do?

07:11.735 --> 07:13.520
- Oh!
- Foul ball.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.565
Ha!

07:15.609 --> 07:18.307
Ha ha ha.
- Harry.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.657
What are you looking at?
Get your own ball.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.355
- Harry.
- Mine.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.575
I just caught it.
- Harry.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.011
Here you go.
- Thanks.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.056
Good job, kid.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.710
I want that back.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.582
What are you doing?

07:32.626 --> 07:34.149
Watching the game.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.761
When these
hammy humans are finished,

07:37.805 --> 07:39.633
I'm going to pick
the celestial flowers

07:39.676 --> 07:42.026
that grew from the water
of my spaceship.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.289
It is for my radio.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.728
What do flowers
have to do with your radio?

07:47.771 --> 07:50.426
Plants have the most
complex biochemistry

07:50.470 --> 07:52.472
of anything in nature,

07:52.515 --> 07:55.126
yet humans give them to say,

07:55.170 --> 07:56.563
"I love you.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.522
Here are some flowers.
You are dead."

07:59.566 --> 08:00.871
I want to see this radio.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.969
<i>Why is she looking at me</i> <i>
like that?</i>

08:12.013 --> 08:14.668
<i>Do I have a booger</i> <i>
on the edge of my nose?</i>

08:14.711 --> 08:16.278
<i>Is it on my face?</i>

08:16.321 --> 08:18.367
You know, I've always really
been interested in radios.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.675
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, how do they work?

08:21.718 --> 08:23.415
You know, like this one,
for instance.

08:23.459 --> 08:27.202
Like, how does it actually send
a signal across the universe

08:27.245 --> 08:29.509
all the way to your planet?

08:29.552 --> 08:31.511
In two days,
at exactly 11:06 a.m.,

08:31.554 --> 08:32.903
the Earth's axial tilt

08:32.947 --> 08:35.602
will be in line
with the Mars Transit Station.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.909
Transit station on Mars?
That's weird.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.563
We didn't know
anything about that.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.044
Ha ha ha!

08:43.087 --> 08:47.265
Humans don't know anything
about anything.

08:47.309 --> 08:50.573
- Mm-hmm.
- It's funny because it's true.

08:50.617 --> 08:54.969
So this fissure of tellurium

08:55.012 --> 08:57.014
will boost the radio signal,

08:57.058 --> 08:59.843
bouncing the message
off of the radio transmitter

08:59.887 --> 09:03.194
which humans
have named Oumuamua.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.152
Huh.

09:05.806 --> 09:08.504
And it will send
the message to my people.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.681
All the way to your planet.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.857
Off the radio transmitter.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.339
Anyway,
it will send them the message,

09:17.382 --> 09:20.168
and they will not come
and kill everyone.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.735
I have to do it
at that exact time.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.998
Why that exact time?

09:24.041 --> 09:25.086
Because the...

09:27.436 --> 09:28.829
The conditions will be ideal,

09:28.872 --> 09:32.615
and they will not be ideal
again for an entire year,

09:32.659 --> 09:34.878
and then it will be too late.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.140
Why are you squinting at me?

09:36.184 --> 09:37.577
Why are you asking
so many questions?

09:37.620 --> 09:41.450
Do I have a booger on my face?
Point at the booger.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.671
Mm, I think you're lying
about what this is.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.237
Painful.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.762
Your last radio ended up
being a human death bomb,

09:48.805 --> 09:50.241
and you lied that whole time.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.852
Well, you just lied to me
just now

09:51.895 --> 09:53.505
about being interested
in radios.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.682
I knew you were lying.
You're not a good actress.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.598
You could not play
a beach corpse

09:58.641 --> 10:00.643
on "Law and Order."
- Excuse me.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.079
You know,
this "tellurium fissure,"

10:02.123 --> 10:03.690
it goes right through
the reservation,

10:03.733 --> 10:06.301
so I think that's maybe where
we're gonna go to set it up.

10:06.344 --> 10:09.957
- We?
- Yes, we.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.219
My dad and I are coming

10:11.262 --> 10:13.047
just to make sure
you're not lying.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.355
Still painful.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.714
Good to see you.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.759
<i>I like being</i> <i>
on the reservation.</i>

10:29.803 --> 10:33.807
<i>It feels comfortable.</i> <i>
There is a warmth to it.</i>

10:33.850 --> 10:36.374
<i>They must like it too,</i> <i>
since they're always together.</i>

10:36.418 --> 10:39.987
Hey, Harry.
Let's get you some food.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.119
Yes.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.555
Big Leroy.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.209
- Yep.
- Get Harry a plate, yeah?

10:45.253 --> 10:46.428
Yeah, for sure.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.734
Oh, oh, hey, hey.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.954
- And how's little Leroy?
- Hopefully almost here.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.783
Starting to kick
like a little fancy dancer.

10:53.827 --> 10:54.784
Oh.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.441
Are you outdoorsy, Harry?
- Yes.

10:59.484 --> 11:02.444
My people prefer it outdoors.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.925
Oh, who are your people?

11:04.968 --> 11:06.404
The Dutch.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.018
All right, here you go. Enjoy.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.672
Thank you.

11:23.073 --> 11:26.337
You're that Harry weirdo
who came with Dan and Asta.

11:27.991 --> 11:31.821
And you're that weirdo
who talks to weirdos.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.518
Weirdo.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.393
I'm Drew.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.224
It's all kind of my fault.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.661
You know, it's like
every time I leave the city

11:45.705 --> 11:47.184
and come back to the rez,

11:47.228 --> 11:49.360

to get my name.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.457
It's Elliot.

22:51.500 --> 22:55.112
I even got a lanyard
from my worksite.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.418
- Worksite?
- Yeah.

22:56.462 --> 22:57.637
Very adult.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.203
I got a degree
in archaeology

22:59.247 --> 23:02.293
thinking I was gonna be
the Indigenous Indiana Jones.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.426
I'd watch that.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.211
So did you find the Ark?

23:07.255 --> 23:09.213
Not yet.

23:09.257 --> 23:10.389
I don't give up very easily

23:10.432 --> 23:12.869
when I'm looking
for something special.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.784
Right.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.266
Coming.

23:21.225 --> 23:24.446
- He's cute.
- That guy? No.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.536
I can't date him.
His hair's way nicer than mine.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.451
You're, like,
even worse than Mike.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.887
Oh, real talk, though.

23:30.931 --> 23:34.151
The Munsters are coming to town
for the summer.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.544
Gerald and Bethany are here?

23:35.588 --> 23:36.893
It's my dad's
birthday tomorrow.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.200
- Aw.
- Will you come to dinner?

23:39.243 --> 23:41.028
They love you,
and if you're there,

23:41.071 --> 23:43.726
maybe they'll have fun
and not try to fix my life.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.337
Of course,
and it will be fun.

23:46.381 --> 23:49.819
But why are you
still talking to me?

23:49.863 --> 23:52.039
Sorry, ma'am,
we're all out of T-shirts.

23:52.082 --> 23:52.996
Damn it.

23:55.695 --> 23:59.394
- Asked around about you.
- Oh, great.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.917
So you know I'm a disaster.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.267
I know
you're a professional skier.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.921
That was a long time ago.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.446
Who you were
isn't who you are.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.580
You're funny and smart,

24:11.624 --> 24:13.800
and you got a wicked arm.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.933
And you're pretty.

24:16.977 --> 24:21.503
Uh, actually, I think
you're really, really pretty.

24:23.113 --> 24:26.334
So you should let me take you
out to dinner tomorrow.

24:26.377 --> 24:29.076
I already have
a dinner thing,

24:29.119 --> 24:32.732
but if you're down for dessert,
we could meet up after.

24:35.909 --> 24:39.434
Okay, oh, and be sure
to be holding a single red rose

24:39.478 --> 24:40.783
so I can tell you apart

24:40.827 --> 24:43.960
from all the other hot guys
waiting for a lady.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.006
That's good.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.486
Now can I buy a drink
for your friend

24:47.529 --> 24:48.617
down at the end of the bar

24:48.661 --> 24:51.141
for telling you
to flirt with me?

24:58.235 --> 25:00.020
Courtesy of our mayor.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.894
Hi, Mitch Green,
Mayor of Jessup.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.549
It is so nice to have
a fellow mayor visiting.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.377
Good to meet you, Ben.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.510
That is so nice of you.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.816
This water
is from the '73 wildfire.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.992
Smoke settled
on an exceptional snowpack,

25:16.036 --> 25:18.212
giving the water clear tones
of mesquite.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.780
Yeah, I think we're probably
pretty good on the water.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.173
You're angry about the ad.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.915
Look, a little rivalry's good
for the both of us.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.395
You'll understand
in a few years

25:27.438 --> 25:29.005
when you've been a mayor
for a little longer.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.660
Well, I have been a mayor
for quite some time,

25:31.704 --> 25:33.880
and I have seen...
a lot.

25:33.923 --> 25:37.536
The truth is, you just have
a tougher hill to climb.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.277
See, we have the best water
in the world,

25:40.321 --> 25:42.541
and you have 59 dead miners.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.325
It's...so tragic.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.196
That's not tragic.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.372
The 59 is a story
about sacrifice.

25:48.416 --> 25:50.287
Sorry, Mrs. Mayor,

25:50.331 --> 25:51.680
but doesn't
play like sacrifice.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.377
It plays like the beginning
of a horror movie.

25:53.421 --> 25:54.553
Am I right, Ben?

25:54.596 --> 25:56.076
I actually have a name.
It's Kate.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.947
I'm a teacher
- and I have a JD/
- Ph.D.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.123
in Environmental Law
from CU Boulder.

26:00.167 --> 26:03.562
- I meant no disrespect.
- Oh, yes, you did.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.215
The 59 is a beautiful story

26:05.259 --> 26:08.436
about people who are willing
to die to save each other.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.872
We're a town full of heroes.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.874
And if you can't see that,
you're an idiot.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.920
By the way,
your water tastes like shit,

26:13.963 --> 26:16.444
and who the hell puts
cacao nibs in a citrus salad?

26:16.487 --> 26:17.706
It's gross.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.447
Can't help with
the anger issues,

26:19.490 --> 26:22.624
but...
your salad will be comped.

26:31.285 --> 26:34.636
What happened to "He's
probably a perfectly nice guy?"

26:34.680 --> 26:36.420
Screw him.
We're outta here.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.074

your favorite?

32:12.756 --> 32:15.020
"Dream Warriors", obviously.

32:15.063 --> 32:18.414

Freddy line of all time.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.590
both: Welcome to
prime time, bitch.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.772
Oh, my God, he's on a date.

32:28.816 --> 32:31.558

- That is shoulder dystocia.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.709
- Is that bad?

in the middle of nowhere,

35:37.657 --> 35:39.441
that's full of people

35:39.485 --> 35:41.878
who don't know
how to leave well enough alone.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.535
Good night.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.842
Oh, no.
Excuse me.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.725
<i>How are you doing,</i> <i>
really, sweetheart?</i>

36:02.769 --> 36:05.206
Are you okay?
- Great, I'm happy.

36:05.250 --> 36:09.210
I'm doing incredibly good.
Too good, actually.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.517
Because, you know,
your mother and I were talking,

36:11.560 --> 36:12.779
and there's a lot of
very interesting possibilities

36:12.822 --> 36:14.781
in Park City.
- Some really cute men too.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.870
Very outdoorsy.
You like that.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.350
You know you can
accomplish anything

36:18.393 --> 36:20.090
if you just
put your mind to it.

36:20.134 --> 36:22.005
Remember how driven she was,
even as a little girl?

36:22.049 --> 36:24.443
Remember that time on TV
she saw that guy

36:24.486 --> 36:25.835
pull the tablecloth
off the table

36:25.879 --> 36:27.837
without spilling anything?
Do you remember that?

36:27.881 --> 36:30.971
Yes, she was so determined.
she practiced and practiced.

36:31.014 --> 36:33.539
She dressed up like a magician.
She had the hat--

36:33.582 --> 36:35.628
I know, and she actually
pulled the trick off.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.891
She was so proud of herself.

36:37.934 --> 36:40.589
You know, sweetheart,
I have a friend, Bill,

36:40.633 --> 36:41.895
who runs a realty business.

36:41.938 --> 36:44.376
Maybe there might be something
in that for you.

Yeah.

I was elbow deep

up for adoption

39:21.184 --> 39:26.015
because we send our offspring

What do you know
about lighthouses, Ethan?

41:24.264 --> 41:29.095
I did a work-study one summer
at a lighthouse

41:29.138 --> 41:32.315
off the coast of Portugal.
It was breathtaking.

41:32.359 --> 41:37.059
They're symbols of guidance,
of strength, of truth.

41:39.453 --> 41:43.196

the truth.

I know it hasn't been
very comfortable,

41:51.334 --> 41:55.861
but we've done everything
above board because, in part,

41:55.904 --> 41:59.081
I have a lot of reverence
for your kind.

41:59.125 --> 42:03.085
Mid-westerners?

42:03.129 --> 42:06.654
You're very likable, Ethan.

42:08.787 --> 42:12.007
Show me your true form.

42:13.313 --> 42:17.230
- You're looking at it.
- I know the truth.

42:17.273 --> 42:21.800
My father and I, we saw
your kind at the lighthouse,

42:21.843 --> 42:25.238
and everyone made him feel
like he was crazy.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.330
And so he took his own light
out of this world.

42:32.158 --> 42:37.032
But I evolved.
We evolve through pain.

42:42.124 --> 42:44.344
I thought that would
make you change.

42:44.387 --> 42:46.215
My hand.

42:48.478 --> 42:51.307
You're a doctor.
Fix it.

43:00.403 --> 43:02.928
What is it?
- We just picked up a signal.

43:02.971 --> 43:06.714
Lines of encrypted code,
but the signature is alien.

43:13.678 --> 43:15.941
Ah, shut it off.
Shut it off.

43:15.984 --> 43:17.856
Ah, just woke me up
from the best dream.

43:17.899 --> 43:19.945
I was having a threesome
with a starfish

43:19.988 --> 43:21.686
and a Little Neck clam.
