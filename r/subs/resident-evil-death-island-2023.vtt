WEBVTT

01:05.973 --> 01:08.528
<i>Unit
6, come in. What's your ETA?</i>

01:08.661 --> 01:11.132
Be there in five.
Crossing the bridge now.

01:11.264 --> 01:14.667
<i>When you arrive, drop the
team off and stand by for orders.</i>

01:14.802 --> 01:15.802
Roger that.

01:17.705 --> 01:19.974
Why do you think
they made us gear up like this?

01:20.107 --> 01:22.342
Whatever it is,

01:22.475 --> 01:25.545
it's serious enough
to call us off-duty guys in.

01:25.678 --> 01:28.381
Shit, Dylan, we could be
in San Fran right now,

01:28.515 --> 01:30.583
eating crab and drinking beer.

01:30.718 --> 01:33.686
Frisco isn't going anywhere
anytime soon, JJ.

01:35.688 --> 01:38.092
Let's just get through this.

01:38.225 --> 01:41.162
We're almost at
Raccoon City, so listen up.

01:41.294 --> 01:43.396
The city's on lockdown.

01:43.530 --> 01:47.168
Orders are to assist evacuation
of Umbrella Corp execs

01:47.300 --> 01:49.502
and government officials only.

01:49.636 --> 01:51.404
No civilians.

01:51.538 --> 01:53.874
Repeat. No civilians.

01:55.042 --> 01:56.676
What if they try to get past us?

01:56.811 --> 01:58.779
You're cleared to shoot to kill.

02:00.881 --> 02:02.016
Seriously?

02:07.854 --> 02:09.454
I want a line
in front of the truck.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.456
Double time.
Move. Move.

02:16.528 --> 02:18.674
<i>This is a warning to all civilians.</i>

02:18.698 --> 02:20.967
<i>Return to your homes
and shelter there.</i>

02:21.100 --> 02:23.203
<i>Repeat, return to your homes.</i>

02:24.570 --> 02:26.739
What the hell is going on?

02:26.873 --> 02:28.741
That's what I wanna know.

02:28.875 --> 02:30.109
<i>Heads up.</i>

02:30.243 --> 02:31.811
<i>An Umbrella exec
is coming through.</i>

02:31.945 --> 02:33.213
<i>Close ranks and stay sharp.</i>

02:42.688 --> 02:46.059
They're rioting!
Safeties off. Fire on my orders.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.432
Goddamn, this hurts!

02:53.565 --> 02:54.801
They fucked chief up!

02:54.934 --> 02:56.278
What's wrong with those people?

02:56.302 --> 02:57.412
Tore his body wide open.

02:57.436 --> 02:59.105
They got rabies or something.

02:59.239 --> 03:02.809
They took his body and...
Motherfuckers!

03:02.942 --> 03:04.643
I've stopped the bleeding.

03:04.777 --> 03:08.014
Just hang tight, okay?
We're calling for evac.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.949
Carl. Carl.

03:11.317 --> 03:12.752
Carl?

03:12.886 --> 03:14.153
Copy that.

03:14.287 --> 03:16.521
We managed
to get our wounded to safety.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.424
- We need evac or they're...
<i>- They're infected.</i>

03:19.558 --> 03:21.426
Sorry, i-infected?

03:21.560 --> 03:25.098
<i>Affirmative. Quarantine
them and wait for orders.</i>

03:25.231 --> 03:27.399
Y-you want us to do what?

03:34.974 --> 03:37.043
What are you doing?

03:37.176 --> 03:39.178
You can't lock them in there.

03:39.312 --> 03:41.948
We need to get them
to a hospital. Now.

03:43.615 --> 03:47.353
HQ says we have to quarantine
them and stand by.

03:48.654 --> 03:49.822
Quarantine?

03:49.956 --> 03:51.324
<i>Unit 6, come in.</i>

03:51.456 --> 03:53.159
<i>Anyone in Raccoon City
who's infected</i>

03:53.293 --> 03:55.828
<i>must be shot on sight.
No exceptions.</i>

03:55.962 --> 03:58.131
<i>Not even our people.</i>

03:58.264 --> 04:00.900
You want us to kill our team?

04:01.034 --> 04:02.634
<i>Terminate
with extreme prejudice.</i>

04:02.769 --> 04:05.171
<i>Then we'll send evac. Over.</i>

04:10.276 --> 04:12.544
No, man. No.

04:12.678 --> 04:15.381
We gotta do this.
Are you fucking crazy?

04:15.514 --> 04:17.183
That's our team.
You can't kill them.

04:17.317 --> 04:19.185
If we don't, there's no evac.

04:24.122 --> 04:26.590
This has to be a mistake.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.228
They just need a doctor
or something!

04:30.362 --> 04:31.629
They need help!

04:32.965 --> 04:35.599
Don't do this!
You'll regret it!

04:35.734 --> 04:38.636
I'll regret it more
if they get loose!

04:46.577 --> 04:50.481
Stop it!

06:19.738 --> 06:22.474
So, what's the deal
with this Dr. Antonio Taylor guy?

06:22.606 --> 06:25.676
<i>He's wanted
for espionage and aiding enemy states.</i>

06:25.811 --> 06:28.780
<i>San Francisco PD sent SWAT
to his last location,</i>

06:28.914 --> 06:30.882
<i>but they were attacked
by an unknown group</i>

06:31.016 --> 06:32.784
<i>with a lot of firepower.</i>

06:32.918 --> 06:35.653
<i>Whoever these people are,
they have Taylor now.</i>

06:35.787 --> 06:37.654
That can't be good.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.557
<i>That's an understatement.</i>

06:39.689 --> 06:42.359
<i>He was involved in top-secret
research for our military.</i>

06:42.493 --> 06:44.728
<i>And now foreign agents
are after him too.</i>

06:44.862 --> 06:48.132
<i>We need him in custody ASAP.
Like, yesterday ASAP.</i>

06:48.265 --> 06:50.401
You love to rush me, don't you?

06:50.534 --> 06:51.902
<i>We know the route the van took.</i>

06:52.036 --> 06:53.504
<i>If our calculations are correct,</i>

06:53.636 --> 06:54.876
<i>it should pass you in a minute.</i>

06:54.972 --> 06:56.140
They're early.

07:41.218 --> 07:42.353
Oh, shit.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.555
I loved that bike.

09:07.570 --> 09:09.105
Smells rancid.

09:10.306 --> 09:11.674
Look at that!

09:11.808 --> 09:12.808
Excuse me.

09:18.581 --> 09:20.950
Hey there.
Are you from the city?

09:21.084 --> 09:23.286
Yeah. Who are you?

09:23.419 --> 09:25.188
Claire Redfield from TerraSave.

09:25.321 --> 09:27.523
I'm William Gunnar.
Fish and Wildlife.

09:29.025 --> 09:31.060
Thanks for coming down.

09:31.194 --> 09:33.229
There was a TerraSave tracker
on this thing,

09:33.363 --> 09:35.665
so we figured you had
an interest in it.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.170
Uh...
Is your group, like,

09:41.304 --> 09:44.340
an environmental protection
agency or something?

09:44.474 --> 09:45.842
Actually, we're an NGO

09:45.975 --> 09:48.211
supporting the victims
of bioterrorism.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.015
Huh.

09:52.148 --> 09:53.149
Weird.

09:54.517 --> 09:56.519
Well, whatever.

09:56.653 --> 09:59.155
At least someone's here
to help deal with this mess.

10:03.993 --> 10:05.228
This bite is huge.

10:07.130 --> 10:08.665
Was it a shark?

10:08.798 --> 10:11.301
No. They don't mess with orcas.

10:12.568 --> 10:16.139
Besides, the bite radius
is so big.

10:18.474 --> 10:21.177
There's no shark alive
that could have done this.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.208
<i>Jill, come in.</i>

10:53.409 --> 10:54.544
Go for Jill.

10:54.677 --> 10:55.978
<i>Based on first reports,</i>

10:56.112 --> 10:58.147
<i>this looks like
a bioweapon situation.</i>

10:58.281 --> 11:00.416
<i>Cordon off the street
and wait for backup.</i>

11:00.550 --> 11:03.052
Too late. I'm inside.

11:03.186 --> 11:05.221
Checking for survivors.
<i>Don't go rushing in.</i>

11:05.355 --> 11:06.790
<i>Wait for backup. That's an...</i>

13:55.757 --> 13:56.757
Clear!

13:56.858 --> 13:58.392
Room clear. Restack!

14:03.030 --> 14:04.030
Freeze!

14:13.340 --> 14:14.575
Stand down.

14:15.643 --> 14:16.811
She's with me.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.483
Why'd you go in alone?
I'm not waiting for backup

14:22.616 --> 14:24.819
when there's a chance
someone's in danger.

14:24.953 --> 14:25.987
Right, but...

14:52.747 --> 14:54.983
Hi, Rebecca.
Hey, Chris.

14:55.115 --> 14:56.550
Where's Jill?

14:56.684 --> 14:59.153
I'm having her write up
the report about last night.

14:59.286 --> 15:02.389
Ah. I get it. Punishment.

15:02.523 --> 15:03.792
Don't even go there.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.161
Anyway, the city
now has 12 cases

15:07.294 --> 15:08.662
like the one last night.

15:10.799 --> 15:13.133
Did your tests turn anything up?

15:13.267 --> 15:14.707
Well, they were all infected

15:14.803 --> 15:16.738
with an improved version
of the T-Virus,

15:16.871 --> 15:18.372
and they all have needle marks.

15:18.505 --> 15:20.008
- No bites?
- Hm-mm.

15:20.174 --> 15:22.509
None of them were bitten,
only their victims.

15:22.643 --> 15:26.848
And their victims didn't turn.
They died from their wounds.

15:26.982 --> 15:28.582
From what I can tell so far,

15:28.717 --> 15:32.053
this virus isn't spread via
airborne particles or saliva.

15:34.355 --> 15:36.123
It's something new, then.

15:37.726 --> 15:39.994
We have to stop
whoever's behind this.

15:40.126 --> 15:41.126
Fast.

15:42.295 --> 15:44.832
Jill wasn't bitten, was she?

15:44.965 --> 15:46.599
No.

15:46.734 --> 15:49.870
Just being reckless, as usual.

15:50.004 --> 15:51.504
Why are you so hung up on that?

15:51.638 --> 15:52.906
You think you're the only one

15:53.040 --> 15:54.908
allowed to risk your life
to save others?

15:55.042 --> 15:56.275
What?

15:56.409 --> 15:57.945
After all she's been through,

15:58.078 --> 16:00.047
she's finally back in the field.

16:00.179 --> 16:02.615
If she's being reckless,
like you say,

16:02.750 --> 16:04.493
it's probably because
she's trying to make up

16:04.517 --> 16:06.120
for what happened to her.

16:06.252 --> 16:08.454
You mean,
how Wesker brainwashed her

16:08.588 --> 16:10.189
and made her come after us?

16:10.323 --> 16:12.258
No one's blaming Jill for that.

16:12.392 --> 16:13.559
No one.

16:14.828 --> 16:15.929
Except Jill.

16:54.802 --> 16:55.802
What's up?

16:57.738 --> 17:00.007
I want you off this case.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.307
You need some time off.

17:01.441 --> 17:03.276
You're joking.

17:04.944 --> 17:06.244
It's good you're back.

17:06.378 --> 17:09.116
I just don't want you
to push yourself too hard.

17:09.248 --> 17:10.650
You've been through a lot.

17:12.986 --> 17:15.856
When I was being
mind-controlled by Wesker,

17:15.989 --> 17:18.523
all I wanted was to kill you.

17:18.657 --> 17:20.492
All of you.

17:20.626 --> 17:24.897
I was conscious,
but I couldn't stop myself.

17:26.265 --> 17:27.968
It was like
living in a nightmare.

17:29.136 --> 17:30.303
Sometimes...

17:31.637 --> 17:33.439
the nightmare sticks with you.

17:35.142 --> 17:37.410
And if you're not careful,
it'll swallow you up.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.481
I'm fine now.

17:43.249 --> 17:44.584
Don't worry about me.

17:53.626 --> 17:55.494
There was this guy named Piers.

17:59.699 --> 18:01.768
I wanted him
to take over after me.

18:04.669 --> 18:07.173
I trusted him,
and he trusted me.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.675
He fought alongside me, then...

18:13.780 --> 18:15.181
he died to save me.

18:18.951 --> 18:22.320
We have to be ready to die
in the line of duty.

18:22.454 --> 18:23.823
It's part of the job.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.993
But rushing in
like you did last night,

18:27.126 --> 18:28.828
you're not just
risking your life.

18:30.062 --> 18:31.230
Honestly,

18:31.363 --> 18:33.733
I probably would've
done the same as you.

18:33.866 --> 18:35.935
That's why our job is hard.

18:36.068 --> 18:39.172
We have to consider
stuff like that. Always.

18:42.975 --> 18:47.046
We've been in this fight for so
long, we're getting numb to it.

18:48.547 --> 18:51.383
So we have to be
even more careful now.

18:51.516 --> 18:52.718
Because if we're not,

18:54.020 --> 18:55.755
that numbness...

18:55.888 --> 18:58.090
will burn right down
to our souls.

18:59.992 --> 19:04.429
Innocent people are being
poisoned and used as weapons.

19:04.563 --> 19:07.465
Whoever's doing that
has no soul.

19:07.599 --> 19:09.235
And if we wanna stop them,

19:09.367 --> 19:12.238
we can't afford
to think about being numb,

19:12.370 --> 19:15.942
or souls, or any of that shit.

19:16.075 --> 19:17.910
At least I can't.

19:18.044 --> 19:19.477
Hey.

19:19.611 --> 19:21.747
Come on, Jill. Don't...

19:49.809 --> 19:50.809
Well...

19:52.311 --> 19:53.312
you've done it.

19:54.613 --> 19:57.149
We have a prototype now.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.452
We can move straight
to the mass-production phase.

20:02.554 --> 20:03.923
Nice work...

20:05.291 --> 20:06.726
...Dr. Taylor.

20:26.410 --> 20:27.478
Hm.

20:53.838 --> 20:56.141
Congratulations.

20:56.274 --> 20:59.778
Fate has decided
you'll die some other way.

21:28.672 --> 21:31.443
Hey, Jill. Chris.

21:31.575 --> 21:33.945
Hi, Claire. Thanks.

21:34.079 --> 21:36.547
What's shaking
at the B.S.A.A. these days?

21:37.648 --> 21:38.783
Same old thing.

21:38.917 --> 21:41.086
Bioterrorists sure are stubborn.

21:43.188 --> 21:44.789
How are things at TerraSave?

21:44.923 --> 21:47.258
Oh, you know.
Same.

21:48.893 --> 21:52.964
I'm dealing with my own set
of stubborn bad guys.

21:53.098 --> 21:56.101
Well, neither are as stubborn
as you two.

22:01.039 --> 22:03.607
This area
around the Farallon Islands

22:03.742 --> 22:06.244
is a giant national
marine sanctuary.

22:06.378 --> 22:09.748
Some whales we were tracking
have been disappearing.

22:09.881 --> 22:11.916
There, off Alcatraz.

22:12.050 --> 22:15.787
Oh... Lost whales aren't really
the B.S.A.A.'s thing.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.057
So why'd you call us?

22:19.190 --> 22:21.393
I checked the DNA
we got from a bite wound

22:21.525 --> 22:23.261
on an orca carcass
that washed up.

22:23.395 --> 22:26.097
It had a strain
of T-Virus in it.

22:26.231 --> 22:28.832
It's similar to the virus
we found in the infected

22:28.966 --> 22:30.566
that have been turning up
in the city.

22:30.701 --> 22:32.436
You're kidding.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.338
And get this.

22:34.471 --> 22:36.173
The police
couldn't find a connection

22:36.306 --> 22:38.075
between the folks
that were infected.

22:38.208 --> 22:39.642
But I dug a little deeper

22:39.777 --> 22:42.212
and found they all had one thing
in common.

22:48.719 --> 22:50.653
No way.

22:50.788 --> 22:53.323
They all visited
Alcatraz recently.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.042
<i>...a
modern marvel of engineering.</i>

23:02.066 --> 23:03.867
<i>If it's on your list
of things to see</i>

23:04.001 --> 23:07.037
<i>while visiting San Francisco,
you can check it off right now.</i>

23:07.171 --> 23:10.707
<i>And straight ahead, folks,
there it is, Alcatraz.</i>

23:13.977 --> 23:16.213
Rebecca, we're almost there.

23:16.346 --> 23:17.815
Gotcha.

23:17.948 --> 23:20.484
Hey, this virus is similar
to the other versions

23:20.616 --> 23:22.286
we already have vaccines for.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.621
Yeah, I think
I can slap together

23:25.756 --> 23:27.558
a vax for this one too.

23:27.691 --> 23:30.660
That's the best news
I've heard in a while.

23:30.794 --> 23:32.229
Get to it.

23:32.362 --> 23:35.199
I'll call you
if we find anything.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.401
<i>When the National
Park Service got involved,</i>

23:37.534 --> 23:39.369
<i>they opened up the island,</i>

23:39.503 --> 23:42.239
<i>so that the public could enjoy
not only its rich history...</i>

23:42.372 --> 23:43.874
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

23:44.007 --> 23:46.310
<i>...but also the bird,
marine and animal life</i>

23:46.443 --> 23:49.513
<i>that has flourished here over
the years. Alcatraz has...</i>

23:57.888 --> 24:00.858
I guess he realized
his days were numbered.

24:02.559 --> 24:05.129
Oh, well. He won't get far.

24:14.304 --> 24:15.305
Perfect.

24:18.008 --> 24:22.212
There is a torture device
called the bull of Phalaris.

24:23.347 --> 24:26.116
It was a bull made of bronze.

24:26.250 --> 24:30.954
You put a person inside,
light a fire under it,

24:31.088 --> 24:34.191
then sit back
as the bull heats up

24:34.324 --> 24:38.095
and slowly burns the person
inside alive.

24:38.228 --> 24:40.564
So elegant.

24:42.232 --> 24:46.769
You know, the man who made
the bull died in it.

24:50.373 --> 24:52.542
That's some debut.

24:59.282 --> 25:02.752
Now that our esteemed guests
have arrived...

25:05.121 --> 25:08.925
it's time we debuted
our creation.

25:10.126 --> 25:14.664
I gotta say, uh, this bed sucks!

25:17.033 --> 25:18.768
Hey, it's your boy Zach here.

25:18.901 --> 25:22.838
And today,
I'm checking out Alcatraz!

25:22.972 --> 25:26.075
Help me!

25:28.044 --> 25:30.279
First things first,
hit that subscribe button...

25:30.413 --> 25:33.416
We won't find anything if we
stick with these tourists.

25:33.549 --> 25:35.117
Hm.

25:35.251 --> 25:37.520
I'll go and check the shoreline.

25:37.653 --> 25:39.455
You and Chris
can scope out the places

25:39.589 --> 25:41.857
they don't take the tourists.

25:41.991 --> 25:43.960
Everyone keep your comms open.

25:44.093 --> 25:46.762
But if the shit hits the fan,
call Rebecca.

25:46.896 --> 25:47.930
She'll send backup.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.335
What is that?

25:52.468 --> 25:53.736
Oh, my God.

26:00.676 --> 26:01.676
What is that?

26:04.113 --> 26:06.482
Get back!
Stay away from it!

26:10.586 --> 26:12.321
He just shot him!

26:12.455 --> 26:13.956
We gotta go. Let's go.

26:14.090 --> 26:15.410
Hey, let's go. Come on.

26:17.927 --> 26:20.129
Come on. Everybody, let's go.

26:20.263 --> 26:22.307
- The hell was that?
- Are they dead?

26:22.331 --> 26:23.833
Holy shit!

26:23.966 --> 26:25.736
Yo, yo, yo. Pan over there.

26:25.868 --> 26:28.471
Some dude shot some other dude.
You see that?

26:28.604 --> 26:29.472
What the...?

26:37.880 --> 26:38.881
Oh, shit.

27:00.235 --> 27:01.903
No, no, no. No! No!

27:23.591 --> 27:26.094
Are you okay?
Did it bite you?

27:26.227 --> 27:27.662
No. I'm okay.

27:30.332 --> 27:31.332
Get inside!

27:34.269 --> 27:37.138
Drag that desk over here!
We need to make a barricade!

27:37.272 --> 27:38.373
Got it!
Okay.

27:42.010 --> 27:43.746
Keep it against the door!

27:54.356 --> 27:55.457
Watch out! Up there!

28:01.797 --> 28:02.797
Oh, shit!

28:15.410 --> 28:16.812
How the hell...?

28:20.281 --> 28:22.183
No, they're coming in!

28:22.317 --> 28:23.918
Goddamn it!

28:37.065 --> 28:38.066
Get back!

28:48.343 --> 28:50.678
What the
fuck is wrong with them?

29:02.023 --> 29:03.625
Are you okay?

29:03.759 --> 29:04.860
Are you hurt?

29:38.225 --> 29:39.526
No, no, no.

30:55.168 --> 30:57.839
<i>Did good and evil exist...</i>

30:57.972 --> 31:00.374
when dinosaurs
were killing each other?

31:03.577 --> 31:05.980
Is there even
such a thing as evil...

31:07.047 --> 31:08.382
in a food chain?

31:10.718 --> 31:12.619
Of course not.

31:12.754 --> 31:15.823
Such concepts
were unnecessary back then.

31:40.781 --> 31:41.915
Isn't that right...

31:43.616 --> 31:44.685
JJ?

31:53.359 --> 31:56.997
Stop it!

32:04.670 --> 32:05.671
Shit!

32:34.166 --> 32:35.468
Come in, HQ.

32:37.403 --> 32:38.705
Two survivors.

32:42.208 --> 32:44.343
One's bit and he's bleeding bad.

32:45.578 --> 32:46.713
We need evac.

32:48.048 --> 32:49.382
<i>Negative.</i>

32:49.515 --> 32:52.019
<i>Orders are to terminate
anyone bitten.</i>

32:52.151 --> 32:53.352
<i>No exceptions.</i>

33:48.640 --> 33:51.543
<i>Help me. Please.</i>

34:07.425 --> 34:09.594
Jill, come in.

34:09.728 --> 34:11.797
I can't get through.

34:11.931 --> 34:12.931
Shit.

34:13.933 --> 34:15.433
Comms are down too.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.569
They're jamming us.

34:19.170 --> 34:20.806
We have to find Jill.

34:20.940 --> 34:23.775
Hold on. There could be
more of these in here.

34:23.909 --> 34:25.143
Tons more.

34:25.275 --> 34:28.313
She's alone.
I can't leave her behind.

34:57.810 --> 35:00.112
Wait. Don't shoot.

36:09.214 --> 36:11.149
Leon?

36:11.282 --> 36:14.953
Well, what do you know?
Jill Valentine.

36:15.086 --> 36:16.086
How's it going?

36:20.058 --> 36:24.062
So, uh, Jill, what are
those things doing here?

36:24.195 --> 36:25.629
They were tourists.

36:27.397 --> 36:29.200
That's one fucked-up tour.

36:32.103 --> 36:33.103
You got a gun?

36:33.204 --> 36:34.906
Nope. Lost it.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.542
Here.
Thanks.

36:46.650 --> 36:48.119
Uh-oh.

38:17.341 --> 38:18.341
Duck!

38:26.183 --> 38:27.184
Let's go.

38:30.854 --> 38:32.555
How many of these are there?

38:32.689 --> 38:34.557
I ain't stopping to count.

38:44.868 --> 38:45.868
Move!

38:53.944 --> 38:55.078
Zero.

38:56.213 --> 38:57.646
What?

38:57.781 --> 38:59.615
You wanted to know
how many there were.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.920
Oh.

39:07.891 --> 39:09.026
Anybody here?

39:14.131 --> 39:17.300
What's going
on? Are you guys security?

39:17.434 --> 39:18.935
Police?

39:19.069 --> 39:21.405
I'm with the B.S.A.A.

39:21.537 --> 39:24.107
My name's Chris Redfield.
Who are you?

39:28.278 --> 39:31.982
Well, I'm Tony. Tony Davis.

39:34.151 --> 39:35.986
I'm Claire with TerraSave.

39:36.119 --> 39:38.587
TerraSave? Oh, great.

39:39.790 --> 39:41.291
Is there a problem?

39:41.425 --> 39:43.460
Not unless you're recruiting
for your cult.

39:43.592 --> 39:45.328
I heard what happened
in Harvardville.

39:45.462 --> 39:46.963
You're a bunch of terrorists.

39:47.097 --> 39:49.833
Yeah? And if
you watched real news,

39:49.966 --> 39:52.436
you'd know that we got framed
over some bioweapon bullshit.

39:52.568 --> 39:54.603
That's enough. Both of you.

39:54.738 --> 39:56.907
We've got bigger things
to worry about.

39:57.974 --> 39:59.443
We don't know what's down here,

39:59.575 --> 40:00.643
so keep an eye out.

40:07.684 --> 40:10.253
These are definitely not
the usual infected.

40:11.488 --> 40:12.488
Yeah.

40:14.124 --> 40:15.325
They turn fast.

40:17.094 --> 40:18.361
And without being bitten.

40:22.866 --> 40:24.968
Wait. Where'd the asshole go?

40:29.638 --> 40:31.108
Get away!

40:33.275 --> 40:34.275
Shit.

40:48.623 --> 40:49.623
Fuck!

41:24.326 --> 41:26.128
Let me see.
I wasn't bitten!

41:26.262 --> 41:27.563
Shut up and let me see.

41:29.498 --> 41:32.768
Just a scrape. You're fine.

41:35.571 --> 41:40.276
I... I called you
a terrorist before.

41:40.409 --> 41:43.179
You honestly think I wouldn't
help you because of that?

41:44.113 --> 41:45.247
We'd treat your wounds

41:45.381 --> 41:47.550
even if you were
one of the bad guys.

41:47.683 --> 41:49.018
Hm.

42:05.634 --> 42:07.636
What's up with this tunnel?

42:07.770 --> 42:09.004
It's to move munitions,

42:09.138 --> 42:11.674
back when Alcatraz
was a military fortress.

42:11.807 --> 42:14.610
Thanks for the history lesson.

42:14.743 --> 42:18.047
After this, I'm putting
tour guide on my résumé.

42:19.114 --> 42:20.482
Why are you here?

42:23.552 --> 42:26.088
Dr. Antonio Taylor.

42:26.222 --> 42:28.791
He's a specialist
in robotics engineering.

42:28.924 --> 42:31.126
He tried to sell his research
to another country,

42:31.260 --> 42:33.329
but got kidnapped
by a bunch of terrorists.

42:33.462 --> 42:35.831
Intel said they brought him
to Alcatraz.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.300
What are you doing here?

42:39.401 --> 42:41.303
A new virus is on the loose.

42:41.437 --> 42:42.972
Clues pointed here,

42:43.105 --> 42:46.375
so me, Chris and Claire
came to have a look around.

42:46.508 --> 42:49.010
Our cases seem to be connected.

42:55.416 --> 42:56.417
What's wrong?

42:59.654 --> 43:00.788
You feel that?

43:04.525 --> 43:05.525
What?

43:06.661 --> 43:07.795
There's a draft.

43:14.703 --> 43:16.004
It's coming from here.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.902
We don't know where it goes.

43:48.036 --> 43:51.707
Maybe outside
or farther into this maze.

43:51.839 --> 43:55.043
Either way,
it's better than here.

43:55.176 --> 43:58.079
Come on. It'll be like
we're breaking out of prison.

43:58.212 --> 43:59.080
It'll be fun.

44:20.034 --> 44:21.869
This is not good.

44:23.706 --> 44:26.307
At least we know
we're on the right track.

44:26.441 --> 44:28.242
No. You think?

44:29.444 --> 44:30.713
Yup. Come on.

45:01.542 --> 45:04.011
Comms are down and ammo's low.

45:04.145 --> 45:05.747
I wonder how Jill's doing.

45:09.249 --> 45:11.719
You should take Davis
and get back to the city.

45:13.153 --> 45:14.521
What about you?

45:14.654 --> 45:16.423
I'll find Jill.

45:16.556 --> 45:18.458
We're in way over
our heads here.

45:21.094 --> 45:22.596
Claire?

45:22.730 --> 45:24.799
Claire? What's wrong?

45:26.333 --> 45:27.501
Claire!

45:30.470 --> 45:31.505
Aw, shit!

45:31.638 --> 45:34.941
No. Hey. Can you move?

45:36.243 --> 45:38.111
Oh, my God.

46:19.219 --> 46:21.923
What's a submarine dock
doing here?

46:22.055 --> 46:25.325
Probably another holdover
from when this was a fortress.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.001
They're using
it for an armory now.

46:39.239 --> 46:40.240
Let's check it out.

46:54.387 --> 46:56.223
<i>F.O.S., this is Hunnigan.</i>

46:56.356 --> 46:58.391
Hey, I'm Rebecca.

46:58.525 --> 47:00.695
So Leon's working
with you on this?

47:00.828 --> 47:02.797
<i>Yes, but I still
can't reach him,</i>

47:02.930 --> 47:04.464
<i>so let's save the chitchat.</i>

47:04.598 --> 47:06.199
<i>Did you look
at the info I sent you?</i>

47:06.333 --> 47:07.869
Yeah, I checked it out.

47:08.001 --> 47:09.603
But I'm having no luck
getting through

47:09.737 --> 47:10.977
to Chris and the others either.

47:11.104 --> 47:13.106
I've been trying
for two hours now.

47:13.240 --> 47:15.108
What do you want me
to tell them?

47:15.242 --> 47:17.444
<i>Someone accessed
the DoD's server.</i>

47:17.577 --> 47:19.446
<i>They were looking
for top-secret files</i>

47:19.579 --> 47:23.215
<i>on previous bioterrorism cases,
going back to Raccoon City.</i>

47:23.349 --> 47:24.727
You think this might have
something to do

47:24.751 --> 47:26.920
with the op we're on?
<i>Most likely.</i>

47:27.052 --> 47:30.489
<i>They managed to steal data on
key personnel on those cases:</i>

47:30.623 --> 47:32.491
<i>Leon, Chris, Jill, and Claire.</i>

47:51.878 --> 47:53.078
What are they?

47:54.480 --> 47:55.614
Bio-drones.

47:56.917 --> 47:58.450
That room
we passed through before

47:58.584 --> 48:00.452
is the incubation tank.

48:00.586 --> 48:03.622
The guy I'm here for,
Antonio Taylor,

48:03.757 --> 48:05.959
this is his area of expertise.

48:06.091 --> 48:08.594
And these drones
look ready to go.

48:08.728 --> 48:11.765
So he's gotta be around here
somewhere.

48:13.465 --> 48:15.167
He can wait.

48:15.301 --> 48:17.169
Let's burn it all.

48:17.303 --> 48:19.271
Yeah. We'll start
with the incubation tank.

48:19.405 --> 48:22.308
<i>Well, if it isn't Jill Valentine</i>

48:22.441 --> 48:24.711
<i>and Leon S. Kennedy.</i>

48:24.844 --> 48:27.346
Well, if it isn't...

48:28.414 --> 48:30.282
whoever you are.

48:30.416 --> 48:32.451
Why don't you come out and talk?

48:34.688 --> 48:37.356
<i>How about you come to me?</i>

48:37.489 --> 48:40.559
<i>I'm in the main prison block.
Ground floor.</i>

48:40.694 --> 48:42.896
<i>Chris and Claire
are waiting for you.</i>

48:49.468 --> 48:51.972
- Ready, Miss Chambers?
- Good to go.

48:52.104 --> 48:53.405
What's that?

48:53.539 --> 48:54.540
Vaccine.

48:55.675 --> 48:57.543
I just hope I made enough.

48:57.677 --> 48:59.012
Let's get moving, then.

49:30.209 --> 49:31.711
Chris? Claire!

49:33.245 --> 49:36.414
Leon?
What are you doing here?

49:37.916 --> 49:40.385
Hey, Jill. You're okay.

49:40.518 --> 49:44.123
Oh, my God.
You're so pale.

49:44.255 --> 49:46.424
Claire? Hang in there.

49:47.726 --> 49:49.661
Hurry! Get us out of here!

49:50.863 --> 49:52.563
Son of a bitch.

49:52.698 --> 49:53.899
Antonio Taylor.

49:55.433 --> 49:57.136
What?

49:57.268 --> 49:59.738
His name's Davis.

49:59.872 --> 50:01.639
No. That's a fake name.

50:01.774 --> 50:03.608
He's Taylor, all right.
How did you...?

50:03.742 --> 50:05.811
This scumbag's wanted
for leaking national secrets

50:05.944 --> 50:08.179
to the enemies
of the U.S. of A.

50:13.886 --> 50:16.021
Welcome to Alcatraz.

50:17.255 --> 50:19.557
I'm Dylan Blake.

50:19.692 --> 50:23.829
It's an honor
to have you all here.

50:23.962 --> 50:24.962
Together.

50:27.132 --> 50:28.934
I bet you're wondering

50:29.068 --> 50:33.138
how people are being infected
without being bitten.

50:35.941 --> 50:39.178
That was one of
my prototype bio-drones.

50:39.310 --> 50:44.149
I tell it who to infect,
and it always finds its target.

50:44.282 --> 50:45.818
Leon?

50:45.951 --> 50:47.294
The mass-production versions

50:47.318 --> 50:49.088
are what you saw
in the other chamber,

50:49.220 --> 50:51.322
and they're ready to go.

50:51.456 --> 50:53.424
By tomorrow morning,

50:53.558 --> 50:57.062
my virus will be
all over the world.

51:04.103 --> 51:05.269
I get it now.

51:06.337 --> 51:07.337
The tech...

51:08.741 --> 51:10.809
the virus...

51:10.943 --> 51:12.577
you got them from Arias.

51:13.746 --> 51:15.379
That's why she's here.

51:15.513 --> 51:19.118
Arias and I did
a lot of business together.

51:19.250 --> 51:22.888
So you could say
we were sort of close.

51:23.021 --> 51:26.657
And since you murdered
poor Maria's father,

51:26.792 --> 51:30.528
I thought this was a good
opportunity to settle the score.

51:30.661 --> 51:31.864
For both of us.

51:33.664 --> 51:35.466
Right now, they're probably
cheering us on

51:35.600 --> 51:37.202
from the afterlife.

51:38.302 --> 51:40.239
Picking up...

51:40.371 --> 51:42.406
where Arias left off.

51:42.540 --> 51:44.176
Oh, no.

51:44.308 --> 51:47.512
This is way different
from what he wanted to do.

51:47.645 --> 51:49.148
Well, it's over now.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.548
Get your hands up.

51:55.119 --> 51:59.589
B.S.A.A., D.S.O., TerraSave.

51:59.724 --> 52:03.393
You still think you're fighting
evil syndicates like Umbrella,

52:03.527 --> 52:06.164
saving the world,
et cetera, et cetera.

52:06.296 --> 52:07.296
We...

52:08.331 --> 52:09.466
We protect...

52:10.534 --> 52:12.703
the innocent.
Hardly.

52:12.837 --> 52:16.174
The huge corporations and the
corrupt execs that run them,

52:16.306 --> 52:18.910
the ones
getting big, fat bonuses

52:19.043 --> 52:21.245
for maintaining the status quo,

52:21.378 --> 52:26.083
that's who you work for,
who you really protect.

52:26.217 --> 52:29.921
And the innocent
will continue to suffer

52:30.054 --> 52:33.191
as long as you do.

52:34.892 --> 52:38.562
You're nothing more than pawns,
suckers.

52:40.765 --> 52:42.233
What do you know?

52:43.701 --> 52:44.936
What do I know?

52:48.538 --> 52:49.740
Confusion.

52:51.042 --> 52:52.043
Betrayal.

52:53.711 --> 52:55.246
Guilt.

53:07.892 --> 53:10.328
<i>Repeat, terminate anyone bitten.</i>

53:10.460 --> 53:11.762
<i>No exceptions.</i>

53:14.232 --> 53:15.833
Help me.

53:15.967 --> 53:16.967
Please.

54:07.784 --> 54:10.854
I know I'm sick of this world

54:10.987 --> 54:13.156
and how the ones
with all the money and power

54:13.290 --> 54:16.458
get to decide
what's right and wrong,

54:16.592 --> 54:18.695
good and evil.

54:18.828 --> 54:23.133
There's no such thing as justice
in a world like that.

54:23.266 --> 54:27.037
So I'm going to use my virus

54:27.170 --> 54:29.505
to clean the slate.

54:31.640 --> 54:35.078
Sure. Kill everything.

54:35.211 --> 54:36.713
Like a terrorist.

54:37.814 --> 54:40.050
Not everything.

54:41.685 --> 54:43.386
With these bio-drones,

54:43.519 --> 54:47.390
I decide who gets infected
and who doesn't.

54:48.624 --> 54:52.095
Example, Ms. Valentine.

54:52.228 --> 54:55.432
I left her alone
so she could experience

54:55.564 --> 55:00.337
what I went through
so many years ago,

55:00.469 --> 55:03.907
when I thought
I was on the side of justice.

55:04.040 --> 55:05.507
You're insane.

55:06.743 --> 55:09.545
Instead of pointing
your gun at me,

55:09.679 --> 55:12.349
you should be worried about him,

55:12.481 --> 55:15.218
trapped in that cell
with Claire.

55:15.352 --> 55:17.387
She's not looking too good.

55:19.856 --> 55:23.559
It won't be long
before Claire turns.

55:23.693 --> 55:25.561
And when she does,

55:25.695 --> 55:29.699
she'll rip the not-so-good
Dr. Taylor's guts out.

55:31.167 --> 55:34.404
And another innocent life
will be lost.

55:35.839 --> 55:37.240
You heard him.

55:37.374 --> 55:39.376
Shoot her before she kills me!

55:43.246 --> 55:44.513
Claire!

55:46.449 --> 55:47.684
Goddamn you!

55:57.559 --> 55:59.396
Cut the engine. Goggles on.

56:19.816 --> 56:23.618
Here we have Leon S. Kennedy,

56:23.752 --> 56:28.357
working hard for people who lie
and cover up the truth,

56:28.490 --> 56:33.495
who propagate the endless cycle
of battles he keeps fighting.

56:35.297 --> 56:37.933
And you're
all burnt out from it.

56:38.067 --> 56:40.601
Yeah, well, it's a living.

56:41.804 --> 56:43.705
And Claire Redfield.

56:43.839 --> 56:46.975
You think your group
helps people.

56:47.109 --> 56:48.710
But they don't do anything

56:48.844 --> 56:52.647
to stop the actual cause
of all the suffering.

56:52.781 --> 56:56.085
They offer bandages
instead of real solutions.

56:57.453 --> 56:59.955
I bet you keep doing it
out of pride.

57:00.089 --> 57:04.625
Because it makes you feel
like you're doing good.

57:04.760 --> 57:06.462
Nothing wrong...

57:08.130 --> 57:09.998
...with helping people.

57:10.132 --> 57:11.567
Sure.

57:11.700 --> 57:13.969
Keep telling yourself that.

57:14.103 --> 57:16.138
We both know you prefer
sitting back

57:16.271 --> 57:18.340
and letting others
do the dirty work.

57:21.310 --> 57:23.812
And Chris Redfield.

57:24.612 --> 57:25.914
Despite the fact

57:26.048 --> 57:30.853
you lose team members
on every single mission,

57:30.986 --> 57:33.489
you keep coming back with more.

57:34.857 --> 57:37.092
How many lives
have you sacrificed

57:37.226 --> 57:39.695
in the name of justice,
I wonder.

57:40.996 --> 57:43.065
And finally...

57:43.198 --> 57:45.067
we come to Jill Valentine.

57:46.667 --> 57:49.438
You could shoot Claire
right now and save a life,

57:49.571 --> 57:52.107
but you hesitate.

57:52.241 --> 57:55.377
I get she's a friend and all,
but still,

57:55.511 --> 57:59.014
I thought you want
to protect the innocent.

57:59.148 --> 58:02.751
That's hard to do when you let
your emotions get in the way,

58:02.885 --> 58:05.053
isn't it?

58:05.187 --> 58:07.089
Go fuck yourself.

58:08.257 --> 58:11.426
Like all of you, I did my duty,

58:11.560 --> 58:14.463
protecting the sons of bitches
in power.

58:14.596 --> 58:19.935
The ones who forced me to watch
my best friend beg for his life.

58:21.270 --> 58:23.338
And then ordered me
to kill him anyway.

58:26.942 --> 58:28.977
None of you know what it's like

58:29.111 --> 58:32.047
to live with that
hanging over your head.

58:34.850 --> 58:35.850
Do you?

58:45.993 --> 58:46.993
But soon...

58:49.297 --> 58:51.899
you will know
that kind of suffering.

58:52.033 --> 58:55.236
My bio-drones
will deliver it to the world.

58:55.369 --> 58:59.073
And when people start killing
their friends and family,

58:59.207 --> 59:01.742
there won't be
any more cover-ups.

59:01.876 --> 59:04.845
And there won't be
any more use...

59:04.979 --> 59:06.247
for you.

59:11.118 --> 59:12.118
Move out.

59:13.287 --> 59:14.956
I got movement, 7 o'clock.

59:16.791 --> 59:17.825
Prepare to engage.

59:21.262 --> 59:23.497
Four hundred yards and closing.

59:23.631 --> 59:24.631
Keep it tight.

59:26.968 --> 59:27.968
Three hundred.

59:35.643 --> 59:37.679
Two hundred.
It's coming in fast!

59:44.352 --> 59:45.653
Shit, fire! Fire!

59:50.291 --> 59:52.526
Flip and fire! Fire!

59:52.660 --> 59:54.895
Reload! Stay alert!

59:55.029 --> 59:56.998
It's coming back!
Twelve o'clock!

01:00:32.734 --> 01:00:35.102
You waited too long, Jill.

01:00:35.236 --> 01:00:36.672
I'm disappointed.

01:00:37.706 --> 01:00:38.706
You bastard!

01:00:42.744 --> 01:00:43.744
Jill!

01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:12.405
Don't worry about them.

01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:15.875
They'll suffer for a while,
then turn soon enough.

01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:17.177
As for Jill...

01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:20.380
she can do whatever she wants.

01:01:21.514 --> 01:01:23.350
We're at the final stage now.

01:01:26.853 --> 01:01:29.824
<i>Once the bio-drones hatch
from their Licker hosts,</i>

01:01:29.956 --> 01:01:31.891
<i>we'll have millions.</i>

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.360
<i>They'll leave the island</i>

01:01:33.493 --> 01:01:37.230
<i>and then
there's no stopping them.</i>

01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:51.611
You're bleeding bad.

01:01:51.746 --> 01:01:53.546
I have to stop it.

01:01:54.782 --> 01:01:56.249
Don't bother.

01:01:56.383 --> 01:01:58.385
Worry about yourself.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.090
Can't do anything about me.

01:02:06.126 --> 01:02:08.995
But I can stop your bleeding.

01:02:09.129 --> 01:02:11.164
What's the point?

01:02:11.297 --> 01:02:15.001
After what he said,
don't you feel like giving up?

01:02:17.137 --> 01:02:18.739
He made his choice.

01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:22.175
We made ours.

01:02:22.308 --> 01:02:23.476
That's all.

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.514
The world's fucked up.

01:02:29.182 --> 01:02:30.350
No denying it.

01:02:32.452 --> 01:02:33.788
Destroying it is easy.

01:02:36.189 --> 01:02:39.392
The hard part's
doing the right thing...

01:02:39.526 --> 01:02:40.627
regardless.

01:02:42.028 --> 01:02:43.630
Can't save the world...

01:02:44.931 --> 01:02:46.867
by killing it.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.303
We're all dying.

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:52.807
How can you be so calm?

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:56.811
We got Jill.

01:03:03.283 --> 01:03:05.051
If she's still out there...

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.954
there's hope.

01:03:17.864 --> 01:03:19.431
Stop, stop.

01:03:19.565 --> 01:03:21.533
Thank you. It's okay.

01:03:24.737 --> 01:03:26.505
My life was all about me.

01:03:28.474 --> 01:03:31.443
I didn't care
about anything else.

01:03:31.577 --> 01:03:34.681
If I'd met you all sooner...

01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:37.717
maybe I could've
turned it around.

01:03:37.851 --> 01:03:39.853
Just let me help you.

01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:46.558
I made a back door
to the network.

01:03:49.194 --> 01:03:50.730
For insurance.

01:03:53.833 --> 01:03:56.936
In case they screwed me over,
which they did.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.611
He probably changed all codes
after I escaped.

01:04:07.179 --> 01:04:10.950
But if you enter the password...

01:04:12.117 --> 01:04:13.285
you'll get in.

01:04:17.623 --> 01:04:20.125
Good... luck.

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:48.120
Rebecca!
Jill?

01:04:48.253 --> 01:04:51.691
Thank God you're okay.
I hope you brought some backup.

01:04:51.824 --> 01:04:55.028
They're dead.
I have the vaccine though.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.030
As long as the infection
hasn't killed anyone,

01:04:57.162 --> 01:04:58.597
it can bring them back.

01:04:58.731 --> 01:05:01.633
Awesome.
Okay, follow this waterway.

01:05:01.768 --> 01:05:04.971
It'll take you to the prison.
You'll find Leon and the others.

01:05:05.103 --> 01:05:06.605
They're infected.
What?

01:05:06.739 --> 01:05:08.942
I have to destroy
the incubation tank.

01:05:09.074 --> 01:05:10.743
Tell them I'm headed
to the armory.

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.226
Open the floodgates, Maria.

01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:18.043
Claire!

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:19.175
Claire!

01:06:26.384 --> 01:06:27.384
Shit.

01:06:41.232 --> 01:06:43.035
Rebecca.

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:44.602
Leon!

01:06:44.736 --> 01:06:46.570
I have the vaccine.

01:06:46.705 --> 01:06:48.639
I saw Jill out there too.

01:06:48.774 --> 01:06:49.640
Jill?

01:06:49.775 --> 01:06:51.743
She's headed for the armory.

01:06:52.944 --> 01:06:54.211
This will sting a bit.

01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:26.778
What's he up to?

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:40.092
How are you doing?

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:42.525
This stuff works fast.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:44.294
I feel better already.

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:46.563
Thanks, Rebecca.

01:07:48.766 --> 01:07:50.768
Is Leon out there on his own?

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:53.236
Yeah. I doubt
he's 100% yet.

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:55.973
No time to rest, then.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:58.843
Let's go help him.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:09.220
Why's he letting
all the water in?

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:11.488
Huh?

01:08:16.827 --> 01:08:19.529
I am glad the virus
didn't kill you.

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:25.002
I wanted to be the one to do it.

01:08:25.136 --> 01:08:27.203
You don't always get
what you want.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.822
This is for my father!

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:48.024
He was Arias's guard dog.
You were his bitch.

01:09:14.919 --> 01:09:15.986
Dylan!

01:09:19.354 --> 01:09:22.259
I was wondering
where you scuttled off to.

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:23.928
Give up.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.964
Rebecca's cured
the others by now.

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.096
So what?

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.268
I expected she would.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:35.104
It doesn't matter now anyway.

01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:46.850
Soon...

01:09:48.219 --> 01:09:50.520
everyone will see things
as I do.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:55.625
That there is no justice.

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:59.428
That good and evil mean nothing.

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:07.237
And I'll finally atone
for murdering my friend...

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:10.773
so that I could survive.

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:30.659
What the hell?

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:15.097
I will make you pay
for killing my father.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.737
Yeah, well,
your dad was kind of a dick.

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:24.565
Now you can
be with your dad again.

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:34.408
Jill!

01:13:35.643 --> 01:13:37.045
You're all okay.

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:39.815
Guys. They
released the bio-drones.

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.216
We have to stop them.

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:02.003
What the hell is that?

01:14:04.172 --> 01:14:08.176
Dylan used the virus
to fuse with a bioweapon.

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.847
Looks like we're dealing
with this first.

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.184
Let's do it.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.452
Yeah.

01:14:56.656 --> 01:14:57.691
Excuse me.

01:14:58.759 --> 01:15:00.161
He's all yours.

01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:12.406
That thing doesn't wanna die.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.275
He's a tough cookie, all right.

01:15:20.181 --> 01:15:22.883
- Claire!
- What?

01:15:23.017 --> 01:15:25.219
You got that password
Taylor gave you?

01:15:25.352 --> 01:15:27.254
Yeah, right here.

01:15:27.388 --> 01:15:28.622
Fantastic.

01:15:28.756 --> 01:15:31.225
Take Rebecca
and stop those drones!

01:15:31.358 --> 01:15:33.894
We'll keep this guy busy.

01:15:34.028 --> 01:15:35.028
On it!

01:15:36.463 --> 01:15:38.465
Don't die!

01:15:38.599 --> 01:15:39.466
Jill!

01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:13.100
All right.

01:16:14.768 --> 01:16:16.604
Okay, I got this.

01:16:21.342 --> 01:16:23.010
Okay.

01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:24.878
And...

01:16:25.012 --> 01:16:26.113
we're in.

01:16:26.247 --> 01:16:28.683
Great.
Let's stop those bio-drones.

01:17:20.633 --> 01:17:22.302
Chris! Leon!

01:17:24.971 --> 01:17:26.906
What's that?
A plasma rifle.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.042
It heats up to 20,000 degrees,

01:17:29.175 --> 01:17:31.444
but it's short range.

01:17:31.577 --> 01:17:33.379
Can you get that thing
any closer?

01:17:35.882 --> 01:17:37.685
"Can we get it closer?"
she says.

01:17:53.032 --> 01:17:54.100
Hang on!

01:18:08.081 --> 01:18:09.081
Okay, link it.

01:18:09.115 --> 01:18:11.384
Done.

01:18:11.517 --> 01:18:13.419
There's three parameters
on the control code.

01:18:13.553 --> 01:18:15.555
Overwrite those.
Got it.

01:18:18.726 --> 01:18:21.260
It's in manual mode.
Now we can stop them.

01:18:21.394 --> 01:18:23.563
Hold on a sec!

01:18:23.697 --> 01:18:25.231
Why?

01:18:25.365 --> 01:18:28.836
We control the drones now,
so why don't we use them?

01:18:28.968 --> 01:18:31.204
Mm...
Hm?

01:18:34.474 --> 01:18:36.075
I hope this works.

01:18:36.209 --> 01:18:38.779
Definitely going on vacation
after this.

01:19:03.935 --> 01:19:05.671
Time to light you up.

01:19:14.246 --> 01:19:16.448
Is that it? Did we kill it?

01:19:32.964 --> 01:19:34.533
One more to finish you!

01:19:41.039 --> 01:19:42.140
Goddamn it.

01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:53.385
Come on.

01:19:53.518 --> 01:19:54.619
Come on!

01:19:57.622 --> 01:19:58.622
Fuck!

01:20:23.348 --> 01:20:25.751
Go get him!
What's happening?

01:20:27.219 --> 01:20:28.855
The drones are pumping
their virus in,

01:20:28.987 --> 01:20:30.288
overloading it.

01:20:30.422 --> 01:20:32.424
It's messing
with the creature's chemistry.

01:20:32.557 --> 01:20:33.557
See?

01:20:35.928 --> 01:20:37.562
Oh, nice.

01:20:53.779 --> 01:20:55.247
It's heading for open water.

01:20:56.281 --> 01:20:57.516
Like hell it is.

01:21:00.218 --> 01:21:02.654
This controls the gate.
Hurry!

01:21:02.788 --> 01:21:04.256
Yeah. Going down.

01:21:46.063 --> 01:21:47.164
Hey!

01:21:48.332 --> 01:21:49.433
Ugly!

01:21:51.168 --> 01:21:54.171
That's it. Come get me.

01:21:55.907 --> 01:21:57.441
Come on.

01:21:57.575 --> 01:21:59.610
Come get me!

01:21:59.744 --> 01:22:01.211
Come on.

01:22:01.345 --> 01:22:02.345
Come on!

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.382
You know how to use this?

01:22:05.516 --> 01:22:06.818
It's got a trigger, doesn't it?

01:22:08.352 --> 01:22:09.352
That goes in here.

01:22:14.025 --> 01:22:15.894
You'd kill everyone

01:22:16.027 --> 01:22:18.997
because you feel guilty
for killing your friend?

01:22:22.266 --> 01:22:24.970
Deal with it yourself, asshole.

01:23:10.147 --> 01:23:11.582
Down.

01:23:11.716 --> 01:23:13.283
A little higher.

01:23:13.417 --> 01:23:14.417
Yeah.

01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:23.695
Fire!

01:23:43.179 --> 01:23:44.682
And that's that.

01:23:56.894 --> 01:23:58.796
Ha. We did it.

01:23:58.929 --> 01:24:00.563
Is it dead?

01:24:02.231 --> 01:24:03.767
Super dead.

01:24:08.438 --> 01:24:11.709
Looks like us suckers win.
Again.

01:24:13.443 --> 01:24:14.778
Yeah.

01:24:14.912 --> 01:24:17.114
And we'll keep
coming back for more.

01:24:18.247 --> 01:24:19.917
Like always.

01:24:59.255 --> 01:25:02.993
Well, I know what I'm gonna
take away from this experience.

01:25:05.028 --> 01:25:06.496
What's that?

01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:07.998
Prison tours suck.

01:25:09.767 --> 01:25:11.935
So do giant shark monsters.

01:25:13.203 --> 01:25:14.637
So did this op.

01:25:16.874 --> 01:25:20.177
Yeah. But we sure did
kick some ass, didn't we?

01:25:21.377 --> 01:25:22.478
We sure did.

01:25:23.947 --> 01:25:24.982
All of us.

01:25:41.965 --> 01:25:43.033
Glad you're back.

01:25:44.168 --> 01:25:45.168
So am I.
