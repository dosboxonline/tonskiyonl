02:24.828 --> 02:25.953
Hike!

02:30.042 --> 02:31.668
Martel!

02:31.919 --> 02:34.045
Martel, you're a wimp!

02:34.254 --> 02:37.400
I can't believe that!
Martel goes for a give-up slide!

02:37.500 --> 02:38.700
<i>He did look a little cautious.</i>

02:38.750 --> 02:40.718
I got one foot on the grave
and I could have scored on that!

02:40.928 --> 02:42.929
<i>That could be the last play of the season.</i>

02:43.138 --> 02:46.140
<i>In case you haven't heard,</i>
the players' strike became official

02:46.350 --> 02:48.017
<i>at 4 p.m. Eastern time.</i>

02:48.227 --> 02:50.400
<i>I am very sad that the players' demands,</i>

02:50.450 --> 02:53.000
<i>which center around a rise
in the current salary cap,</i>

02:53.200 --> 02:55.274
<i>have been rejected by the owners.</i>

02:55.859 --> 02:58.111
<i>Now, I have told my union brothers to walk.</i>

02:58.320 --> 03:01.197
Get me Jimmy McGinty.
Have him here tonight, huh?

03:01.400 --> 03:02.500
Yes, sir.

03:03.409 --> 03:04.659
<i>I'm here with Washington
Quarterback Eddie Martel,</i>

03:04.868 --> 03:07.286
<i>and, Eddie, there are a lot
of angry fans out there tonight</i>

03:07.496 --> 03:09.497
<i>that feel the players are being
too greedy with their demands.</i>

03:09.665 --> 03:11.749
<i>Anything you'd like to say to that?</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:14.900
<i>Yeah, Dwight, look, I know 5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money,</i>

03:15.003 --> 03:18.589
<i>but I have to pay 10% to my agent, 5%
to my lawyer. I've child support, alimony...</i>

03:18.799 --> 03:21.676
<i>Do you have any idea what insurance
costs on a ferrari, mother--</i>

03:21.885 --> 03:24.053
<i>Pat, back to you.</i>

03:24.263 --> 03:26.931
Okay, <i>that was Washington
running back Malcolm Lamont.</i>

03:27.141 --> 03:30.518
<i>You know, it's all about money, folks,
but, heck, isn't it always?</i>

03:30.728 --> 03:34.605
<i>It usually is. This is Pat Summerall
for John Madden saying so long</i>

03:34.815 --> 03:36.399
<i>from Nextel stadium.</i>

03:37.359 --> 03:40.445
- You look like shit.
- Well, I'm dying, Jimmy.

03:43.073 --> 03:44.699
Come on.

03:45.075 --> 03:46.576
You've been dying for 20 years.

03:48.454 --> 03:49.871
Salut.

03:55.127 --> 03:57.336
- Give me a cigarette.
- I quit.

03:58.964 --> 04:01.007
Nobody likes a quitter, Jimmy.

04:03.385 --> 04:05.261
- See the game today?
- Nah.

04:05.596 --> 04:06.763
Why, you liar!

04:08.223 --> 04:10.933
Could you believe that slide by Martel?

04:11.727 --> 04:14.020
What a pussy!

04:16.648 --> 04:19.483
- What's up?
- Take a ride with me, Jimmy.

04:21.737 --> 04:23.154
How's the wife?

04:23.363 --> 04:25.573
She had her lips donee.

04:25.783 --> 04:28.534
I never even knew
you could have your lips done.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.205
Looks like a large mountain bass.

04:35.292 --> 04:38.586
Look, Jimmy, I'm too old to screw around.
Let me give it to you straight, huh?

04:38.796 --> 04:39.921
I want you back.

04:41.131 --> 04:43.716
- You already have a coach.
- Well, I'll take care of that.

04:43.926 --> 04:46.928
- Yeah, like you took care of me.
- Now, Jimmy!

04:47.137 --> 04:51.224
You don't have any players. They all flew home
to their castles in their private jets, remember?

04:51.433 --> 04:53.518
Well, we're gonna finish the season anyway.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.978
We're gonna use replacement players.

04:56.355 --> 05:00.316
- Jeez, what a business.
- Well, we've got four games left.

05:00.526 --> 05:02.485
We win three, we're in the playoffs.

05:02.694 --> 05:03.736
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:03.946 --> 05:06.113
Win three out of four
with replacement players?

05:06.323 --> 05:11.452
- That's not too much to ask, is it?
- You won for me once, you can do it again.

05:12.788 --> 05:14.288
What's the matter, Jimmy?

05:14.498 --> 05:17.834
Look, nobody's gonna give you
a better chance than this.

05:18.043 --> 05:19.877
After that Dallas mess.

05:21.547 --> 05:24.882
- I was right about that.
- It had nothing to do with being right!

05:25.092 --> 05:27.593
You went head to head with
an $8 million quarterback.

05:27.803 --> 05:31.347
Who the hell did you think was gonna win?
But that's not gonna happen here.

05:31.557 --> 05:35.893
I'm talking about a team of
poor nobodies who play to win.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.312
Not a bunch of bitchy millionaires!

05:40.065 --> 05:41.315
Come on, Jimmy!

05:42.526 --> 05:44.026
I'm thinking.

05:49.032 --> 05:53.160
Hello!

06:06.508 --> 06:08.718
I want total control of my team.

06:08.927 --> 06:12.722
I wanna be able to recruit anybody
that I want, no interference.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.101
My word is my bond.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.813
I want it in writing.

06:22.316 --> 06:23.900
Okay, Jimmy.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.318
Okay.

06:27.529 --> 06:29.864
Well, we thought we'd skip
special teams for the moment.

06:30.073 --> 06:33.242
It's gonna be tough enough just putting an offense
and a defense together in less than a week.

06:33.452 --> 06:36.037
- We're gonna go a different way.
- Different way?

06:36.413 --> 06:39.498
Here's a list of people I've been
keeping my eye on over the years.

06:39.708 --> 06:42.835
They've all played football somewhere.
Not all of them in the pros,

06:43.045 --> 06:45.630
but they all have something
unique to bring to the game.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.841
We're gonna take those people
and try to put together a winning team.

06:49.051 --> 06:52.178
If nothing else, they should be fun to watch.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.931
Daniel Bateman, S.W.A.T. team officer.

06:55.599 --> 06:58.351
Awarded a purple heart for losing
a kidney during the gulf war.

07:00.228 --> 07:01.604
Yeah!

07:03.732 --> 07:06.776
He was a walk-on at Michigan state
before he gave up football

07:06.985 --> 07:10.029
to sneak back in the service
for one more tour of duty.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.323
Clifford Franklin.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.116
Great attitude, great desire,

07:14.326 --> 07:17.536
and the fastest son of a bitch I've ever seen.

07:19.164 --> 07:21.874
Hey! Clifford! Twinkie!

07:27.798 --> 07:30.299
What's up, man? Got any twinkies?

07:30.509 --> 07:31.592
But can he catch?

07:42.771 --> 07:44.897
That's why I have you, Leo.

07:45.107 --> 07:47.024
André and Jamal Jackson.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.194
Together, these guys were the best
tandem team of guards in the game.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Hello. Who is it? You're kidding me!

07:55.491 --> 07:57.284
André got traded, and they both fell apart.

07:57.494 --> 08:01.455
B.F.D., bro. He ain't our problem no more.
We gonna play football.

08:01.665 --> 08:03.249
- Football?
- Football.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.793
- Football.
- Football.

08:06.920 --> 08:11.215
Nigel Gruff. A striker out of Cardiff,
now residing in Hell's Kitchen.

08:12.634 --> 08:16.679
They call him "the leg", because he can kick a
soccer ball the entire length of the field and score.

08:16.888 --> 08:18.139
Gentlemen...

08:18.348 --> 08:20.558
The drinks are on the house!

08:23.603 --> 08:24.770
- Oh, bollocks.
- Hey!

08:25.647 --> 08:27.648
- Pissing away our money again, huh, Nigel?
- No, no, no, no.

08:27.858 --> 08:31.152
- The money's on the way.
- Yeah, on the way where, to the O.T.B.?

08:31.361 --> 08:34.030
Listen, I got a line on a horse.
It's a winner. I swear on my mum's grave.

08:34.239 --> 08:35.799
Your what? Your mother's grave?
Vito, listen to this guy.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.198
He's swearing on his mother's grave now.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.534
Nigel, listen to me. I want my money!

08:39.745 --> 08:42.455
- Has he kept in shape?
- By Welsh standards.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.916
Shane Falco.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.171
Shane Falco?
Footsteps Falco from Ohio state?

08:50.338 --> 08:51.380
The same.

08:53.091 --> 08:56.677
- He hasn't played in years.
- Should be well rested then.

09:00.724 --> 09:03.059
You look like a swordfish I caught once.

09:03.268 --> 09:05.394
Yeah, he hit the deck just like that.

09:07.397 --> 09:09.774
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.817
Jimmy Mcginty.

09:12.027 --> 09:14.361
That old coach from the 80s.

09:16.865 --> 09:18.657
And we met just before the Sugar Bowl.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.409
I remember.

09:21.828 --> 09:24.330
Hell of a game, that Sugar Bowl.

09:24.539 --> 09:28.250
- What'd you lose that by, 40 points?
- That would be 45.

09:30.295 --> 09:33.881
Sometimes a game like that, really
sticks with you. You never shake it off.

09:34.091 --> 09:37.635
- Got three concussions to prove it.
- That's why girls don't play the game.

09:40.263 --> 09:41.472
Why are you here, coach?

09:41.681 --> 09:44.350
I'm back with the Sentinels.
I want you to quarterback.

09:44.559 --> 09:47.144
I found the best guards available
to protect you and a wide receiver

09:47.354 --> 09:48.938
even you couldn't overthrow.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.400
- I'm retired.
- Retired?

09:54.611 --> 09:57.780
Well, it looks like things have
gone real well for you since.

09:59.449 --> 10:01.283
I got no complaints.

10:01.618 --> 10:03.410
It's quiet here.

10:04.121 --> 10:05.287
Nobody bothers me.

10:05.705 --> 10:09.500
Well, that's the great thing about plankton,
you know, it pretty much keeps to itself.

10:12.796 --> 10:15.589
You know what separates
the winners from the losers, kid?

10:15.799 --> 10:17.258
The score.

10:20.095 --> 10:22.596
Getting back up on that horse
after been kicked in the teeth.

10:22.806 --> 10:25.141
I've watched films of your game
since the Sugar Bowl.

10:25.350 --> 10:28.894
You should have been carrying a clipboard
that first year, not trying to carry the whole team.

10:29.104 --> 10:31.605
Your teammates leaned on you,
and you crumbled.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.300
- Is that how you want to be remembered?
- I don't want to be remembered at all.

10:38.488 --> 10:41.991
You're still young. If you do well, who knows
what 'll happen once the strike ends.

10:42.200 --> 10:46.162
I'm not gonna make you any promises, Shane,
but why don't you take a chance, huh?

10:46.746 --> 10:51.333
Rather than hang out here scraping crap
off the bottom of somebody else's toys?

11:04.931 --> 11:06.515
Think it over.

11:08.685 --> 11:10.436
Could be part of something.

11:13.356 --> 11:15.800
I am down here in our nation's capital,
to remind the football fans that

11:15.850 --> 11:18.485
what these owners are doing
is absolutely unconscionable.

11:18.695 --> 11:20.738
They have blatantly gone out
and hired scabs.

11:21.406 --> 11:24.000
Which goes against all the principles
of our Constitution,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.701
and the Declaration of Independence,

11:25.911 --> 11:27.400
and the Emancipation Proclamation as well.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.580
And, here come the scabs now!

11:32.000 --> 11:34.710
Hey, that's Eddie Martel!
Hey, that's Wilson Carr!

11:36.129 --> 11:40.049
Hey, Wilson, I love you, man!
Hey, what's happening?

11:41.968 --> 11:43.260
Hey, I love you, man!

11:44.846 --> 11:47.848
I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass
and in your ass!

11:48.099 --> 11:51.644
Piss off!

12:18.755 --> 12:20.881
Get that bible out of here!

12:23.761 --> 12:27.053
Sorry. Sorry, lads. Sorry about this.

12:28.098 --> 12:30.432
We are all from god!

12:37.983 --> 12:40.025
I'm very sorry. Sorry.

12:40.777 --> 12:42.361
Hey, forget you!

12:46.366 --> 12:49.034
Get a job, you wankers!

13:07.679 --> 13:08.804
Hell, yeah!

13:09.472 --> 13:10.806
Looking good out there, kid!

13:11.016 --> 13:13.517
You got the goods, baby.
You got the goods!

13:13.727 --> 13:15.978
Where in the hell did you learn
to catch like that?

13:33.496 --> 13:37.499
Roberts, make that D-back commit
before you cut, all right?

13:38.168 --> 13:39.376
Jimmy...

13:39.586 --> 13:43.422
- My tight end is deaf.
- Yeah, l know.

13:43.631 --> 13:46.467
Jimmy, how am I gonna coach a deaf man?

13:46.676 --> 13:47.718
You won't need to.

13:47.927 --> 13:51.513
Brian Murphy would have gone in the first round
5 years ago, if he hadn't been born deaf.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.558
Played his college ball
right here in D.C., Gallaudet.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.686
But, Jimmy, I got to be able
to communicate with him, and how...

13:58.229 --> 14:00.939
- Learn to sign, you know.
- Oh, horseshit!

14:01.149 --> 14:05.235
Look at it this way. He'll never be
called offsides on an audible.

14:05.653 --> 14:07.571
- Hey, coach.
- Hey, Nigel. Good to see you.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.000
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

14:09.100 --> 14:11.033
- Good, good.
- Great.

14:12.494 --> 14:13.619
This is "The Leg"?

14:15.038 --> 14:18.332
I thought you told me he was solid muscle.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.250
Well, he's much stronger than he looks.

14:20.877 --> 14:22.586
I'm wiry.

14:23.046 --> 14:24.922
Go get some kicks in.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.430
He's wiry.

14:34.724 --> 14:36.433
Wiry.

14:49.697 --> 14:52.199
Well, I'm sure that you've been briefed
as to your situation here.

14:52.409 --> 14:54.993
Coach Mcginty has requested you be
turned over to us for the next 5 weeks,

14:55.203 --> 14:57.000
and the governor has been
kind enough to comply.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.330
- You know...
- Nice watch.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.958
What? Oh, this?

15:01.167 --> 15:05.003
lt's a fake. Damn thing's always broken.

15:05.213 --> 15:07.005
It's only right twice a day.

15:07.215 --> 15:09.341
Well, why don't we go ahead
and join the others, shall we?

15:09.551 --> 15:14.721
No sense staying here, now,
by ourselves out of screaming distance.

15:14.931 --> 15:17.000
Come on, let's fire out of there.
Fire out of there!

15:17.100 --> 15:19.000
Hey, Jimmy. Falco... When is he coming?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.853
Relax, Leo. He'll be here.

15:21.062 --> 15:22.187
Come on, quick feet, quick feet!

15:22.397 --> 15:26.066
You know, I am relaxed. That's not the point.
I mean... No, no, it's nervous energy.

15:26.276 --> 15:28.819
Hey, case in point,
we don't have a quarterback, do we?

15:29.028 --> 15:32.072
- Fire out of there. Fire out!
- And we don't have a game plan for Sunday.

15:32.282 --> 15:36.243
And the only good thing I can say
about our one offensive weapon is...

15:36.453 --> 15:38.871
It's wiry! What the shit is that?

15:39.080 --> 15:40.330
No, no, no, it's wiry.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.542
- Well, however the hell you say it!
- Say it: "Wiry".

15:47.797 --> 15:51.717
- Wiry.
- Holy... Look at this mamma-jamma!

16:04.647 --> 16:05.731
Have you lost weight?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.275
Come on, coach, don't say that.

16:08.485 --> 16:10.986
No, you look great.
Why don't you work out on the... [Japanese]?

16:14.365 --> 16:16.992
- So he's lost weight?
- Sumo wrestler.

16:17.202 --> 16:21.288
Expert at pushing people around.
That's what pass blocking is, remember?

16:21.498 --> 16:22.539
That's right, yeah.

16:23.374 --> 16:24.750
All right, next one, 74, come on!

16:25.418 --> 16:27.877
Set! Hut! Keep your butt down!

16:28.296 --> 16:29.588
All right! Way to go!

16:31.007 --> 16:33.000
It's all about pushing people around!

16:33.300 --> 16:36.885
Set! Hut!
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive!

16:37.000 --> 16:41.058
All right, here's the coach's boy. Come on,
sumo boy. Let's see what you can do.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.976
Set! Hut!

16:47.148 --> 16:50.025
Yes! Good hit, sumo boy!
Now get this off of me!

16:50.235 --> 16:51.985
That'll do, pig, That'll do.

16:52.237 --> 16:56.281
- Screw you, cockroach.
- You'll have to find your dick first, Shamu.

16:56.491 --> 16:58.450
Get this off of me, sumo boy!

17:15.385 --> 17:17.970
- Hey, scab!
- What's up, sweet cheeks?

17:18.179 --> 17:20.722
- I don't want any trouble.
- Oh, you guys hear that?

17:20.932 --> 17:23.684
He's taking away my job,
but he doesn't want any trouble.

17:23.893 --> 17:27.521
Not only is he taking your job,
he's taking your parking space, too.

17:27.730 --> 17:29.356
What's up?

17:29.566 --> 17:31.608
Is that right, Falco?

17:32.443 --> 17:34.850
I didn't know it was yours. I'll move it.

17:34.946 --> 17:36.405
No, let us do that for you.

17:36.781 --> 17:39.408
Guys, move the new boy's ride for him.

17:39.617 --> 17:41.743
Coming right up, Mr. Falco.

17:46.958 --> 17:48.333
Ready, fellas?

17:48.543 --> 17:51.295
One, two, three!

18:00.763 --> 18:02.264
Thanks, guys.

18:03.891 --> 18:05.058
Assholes!

18:05.268 --> 18:08.437
Jesus! Footsteps Falco!
They must really be getting desperate.

18:08.646 --> 18:10.063
Hey, Falco!

18:10.273 --> 18:12.482
You're not even a "has been".

18:12.942 --> 18:14.276
You're a "never was"!

18:19.240 --> 18:20.616
Go!

18:25.288 --> 18:27.122
Come on, let's pick it up.

18:27.332 --> 18:29.583
Bateman! Bateman!

18:32.879 --> 18:35.881
Form a line here! Come on, form a line!
Let's go 7 on 7.

18:37.675 --> 18:40.135
Check it out, y'all. It's our new quarterback.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.562
Jimmy, we're in business now.

18:54.525 --> 18:57.361
- You're late.
- Car trouble.

18:57.987 --> 18:59.738
You still got an arm?

19:05.328 --> 19:06.703
Hey, Falco.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.041
Go!

19:28.768 --> 19:30.185
That's gonna leave a mark.

19:31.729 --> 19:34.940
- Leo, Franklin's down again.
- Oh, I'm okay.

19:35.149 --> 19:37.609
I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:37.819 --> 19:39.236
Let's play some football!

19:42.365 --> 19:43.740
Yeah.

19:44.492 --> 19:46.535
4-22 split drive on go. Ready!

19:54.168 --> 19:58.422
- Ready!
- 3-30. 3-30.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.132
Hut!

20:06.139 --> 20:09.057
- Danny Bateman.
- Shane Falco.

20:09.267 --> 20:10.684
Nice pop, Danny.

20:11.519 --> 20:12.644
Thanks, coach.

20:12.854 --> 20:15.605
In practice, we don't hit the fellows
with the red shirts on.

20:15.815 --> 20:20.026
I know, coach, but I see that red, I just
wanna go after it like a bull, you know!

20:22.238 --> 20:25.198
- Okay, Danny.
- Huddle up!

20:25.950 --> 20:27.075
Hey.

20:29.746 --> 20:33.373
I want you to get used to setting up
on the run. Move fast, think even faster.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.543
- You'll live a lot longer.
- I'm very interested in that.

20:36.753 --> 20:37.878
Huddle up!

20:46.596 --> 20:49.639
- Hey! Shane Falco.
- Hey.

20:49.932 --> 20:52.476
I lost a ton of money on that
Sugar Bowl disaster of yours.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.686
What a bloody shambles that was.

20:54.896 --> 20:57.731
You could smell the stink
all the way back in Wales.

Hey-hey, ho-ho #

23:03.441 --> 23:07.068
# Could anyone play better?
Say-say, no-no#

- Thank you.

23:36.390 --> 23:37.557
Can you dance?

23:43.600 --> 23:45.600
So what's up up in here?

23:47.100 --> 23:47.600
Hey, girl.

23:48.110 --> 23:51.237
- Let me have that duck salt over there, man.
- Man, they ain't got no Kool-Aid.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.449
- What the hell is this?
- Chinese spareribs.

23:54.659 --> 23:57.452
You don't want 'em,
get the fuck out of here.

23:57.662 --> 24:00.747
I'm trying to figure out
how the Chinaman over here

24:00.957 --> 24:03.750
gets 700 pounds off eating this shit.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.794
I'm Japanese, not Chinese.

24:06.337 --> 24:08.004
- Same difference.
- What?

24:08.214 --> 24:09.464
It's the same difference!

24:09.632 --> 24:10.674
All that big...

24:15.346 --> 24:16.888
Niggah, please.

24:17.098 --> 24:20.475
You do know Japan and China
are two different countries, right?

24:20.685 --> 24:23.395
- You do know I got a atlas, bitch.
- Really, gangster?

24:23.604 --> 24:24.771
Yeah.

24:29.236 --> 24:33.655
Come on, lads! Hey, we're on the same team!
We're on the same team! Now chill out!

24:34.156 --> 24:37.450
- The mick's right.
- I'm not a mick. I'm bloody Welsh!

24:39.328 --> 24:40.370
Whatever.

24:40.579 --> 24:43.206
- Man, I'm going to sit with the deaf kid.
- Jesus Christ!

24:43.416 --> 24:46.835
Praise His glory, Nigel!
You praise His glory.

24:48.838 --> 24:51.089
# Slash 'em, slash 'em, cut 'em down #

24:51.298 --> 24:53.925
# Smear their blood all over town #

# Punch 'em, hit 'em, make it last #

24:57.054 --> 25:00.015
# Come on, boys, let's kick some ass #

25:04.854 --> 25:08.314
I played one game in the pros,
and I blew out my knee, and that was it.

25:08.691 --> 25:10.233
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

25:10.443 --> 25:14.779
All I wanna do is score one touchdown
before I hang up my pads, and that is it.

25:15.698 --> 25:16.740
You'll get it.

25:29.587 --> 25:30.920
Hey, man.

25:31.464 --> 25:33.965
Wilkinson! Earl Wilkinson!

25:35.718 --> 25:38.386
Boy, I knew I recognized you, man! I knew it!

25:38.596 --> 25:40.597
You played for Minnesota, baby!

25:40.806 --> 25:44.517
Oh, shit! Earl Wilkinson, man! Oh, my God!

25:44.727 --> 25:49.272
Boy, you'd have been All-Pro, if you hadn't
beaten those cops and gone to jail.

25:49.732 --> 25:53.234
What l had meant to say was allegedly...

25:53.444 --> 25:57.530
allegedly beat up them cops,
and because...

25:57.740 --> 26:02.160
a good Christian boy like you
would never do nothing like that.

26:02.745 --> 26:03.912
That's right.

26:04.121 --> 26:07.165
The way I heard it, my man
didn't even do nothing anyway!

26:07.374 --> 26:09.709
Them cops are just jealous of the black man.

26:09.919 --> 26:12.587
You hear what I'm saying?
My boy been living large!

26:12.797 --> 26:16.049
I can't stand the cops. Know what I'm saying?
I better not see a cop! Shit!

26:16.258 --> 26:20.595
- I'll whup a cop's ass. You can believe that.
- I'm a cop.

26:27.436 --> 26:28.686
Look!

26:28.896 --> 26:30.396
Bundt cake!

26:33.943 --> 26:36.611
- Look at all these yummy little monkeys.
- Hello.

26:36.821 --> 26:38.154
Oh, hey.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.823
-Hi.
-Hello.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.500
You... Yeah.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.495
So, are you Heather and Dawn?

26:46.122 --> 26:48.000
- Yup, we sure are.
- This is great!

26:48.050 --> 26:51.550
I can't tell you how excited I am that I actually
have some girls with some dance experience!

26:51.600 --> 26:52.600
You don't know.

26:52.700 --> 26:56.047
- I'm excited, too.
- I know! God, me, too, too.

26:56.257 --> 27:00.176
So, Heather, you were in "Cats",
which is, I can't tell you, so terrific.

27:00.594 --> 27:03.471
Oh, no. You know... "Pussycats".

27:03.681 --> 27:06.766
You know the club next to the airport?
# Pussycats #

27:07.059 --> 27:09.269
- Oh, oh!
- Yeah, yeah.

27:09.478 --> 27:13.857
- So that style of dancing that would...
- Is lap-dancing a style?

27:14.150 --> 27:15.775
No. I mean...

27:15.985 --> 27:18.945
Oh, my god! I forgot to tell you something.

27:19.155 --> 27:20.989
What?

27:21.323 --> 27:23.074
Oh, she always foes that.

27:25.619 --> 27:28.538
Well, I've seen all I need to see.

27:28.747 --> 27:31.332
No way! Oh, my God, l'm so excited!

27:31.542 --> 27:33.001
Go suit up.

27:33.210 --> 27:36.337
- Go down the tunnel and to the left.
- Okay. - Yeah.

27:36.547 --> 27:42.010
Hey, if you guys have any friends down
at the club, would you send them over?

27:42.219 --> 27:45.471
- Sure.
- Yeah, absolutely.

27:45.681 --> 27:48.892
- Where are you going, Number 48?
- Wherever you want me!

27:55.482 --> 27:57.901
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:59.361 --> 28:01.529
I was watching you today.

28:02.031 --> 28:03.156
You looked good.

28:03.365 --> 28:07.035
Good release, strong arm.
You're gonna do fine.

28:07.244 --> 28:10.038
- Thanks.
- I'm Annabelle Farrell.

28:10.623 --> 28:11.956
- Shane Falco.
- I know.

28:12.166 --> 28:15.335
I remember you from that
'96 Sugar Bowl game.

28:15.544 --> 28:18.129
Didn't anybody have anything
better to do that day?

28:19.840 --> 28:22.675
You should get some of your teammates
to help you turn this back over.

28:22.885 --> 28:26.763
Yeah, I was thinking I'd call
AAA later or something.

28:29.725 --> 28:32.310
- Do you want a lift?
- Yeah.

28:32.519 --> 28:36.064
Yeah, yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

28:40.277 --> 28:42.528
Why were you staying in the pocket
at practice today?

28:42.738 --> 28:45.281
Normally, I would never comment
to a quarterback about his style,

28:45.491 --> 28:48.952
but you need to keep scrambling against Detroit,
especially with Prescott back in the lineup.

28:49.745 --> 28:51.955
- Prescott hasn't crossed.
- He's going to on Sunday.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.850
They're keeping it quiet,
so you don't have time to prepare.

28:53.900 --> 28:54.900
How do you know that?

28:55.084 --> 28:57.752
A friend of mine's a cheerleader
for Detroit. She tipped me off.

28:57.962 --> 29:00.750
Since Prescott's a left-sided linebacker,
shotgun formation and roll right.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.465
No, Van Gundy's on the right.

29:02.675 --> 29:05.468
I know. He's been All-Pro 2 years in a row,
but one of my cheerleaders

29:05.678 --> 29:07.971
is friends with a girl whose sister
just broke up with Van Gundy.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.700
She says he's been on a drinking
binge ever since she left him.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.300
- Yeah?
- He's hungover!

29:12.500 --> 29:14.894
He's a good second slower
off the snap than usual.

29:15.104 --> 29:16.688
So I should stick to the right side.

29:16.897 --> 29:19.524
Unless what they say about Martinez is true.

29:22.069 --> 29:25.363
- That was fun.
- This is great. You live out here?

29:25.572 --> 29:27.073
Which one's yours?

29:27.283 --> 29:30.743
Yt's over here. You see that
white yacht with the satellite dish?

29:31.120 --> 29:35.800
I'm the old houseboat next to it,
covered in seagull shit.

29:36.792 --> 29:39.794
- So what did you name her?
- <i>Phyxius</i>.

29:40.004 --> 29:43.756
- <i>Phyxius</i>. What does that mean?
- "Putting to fight".

29:46.135 --> 29:48.720
You wanna come onboard for a beer?

29:49.763 --> 29:53.433
Nothing personal, Shane,
but I don't date football players.

29:53.809 --> 29:55.351
I don't blame you.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.103
Not even quarterbacks?

29:57.313 --> 29:59.772
Especially not quarterbacks.

29:59.982 --> 30:01.858
You guys are the biggest babies of all.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.943
The biggest babies?

30:04.153 --> 30:05.528
Yeah.

30:06.822 --> 30:09.032
- Thanks for the ride.
- Good luck on Sunday.

30:10.326 --> 30:12.827
- Be careful out there.
- I will.

30:23.547 --> 30:25.048
Shane.

30:25.674 --> 30:27.133
What are you up to?

30:27.343 --> 30:29.344
Just...

30:29.970 --> 30:31.763
...watching the game.

30:33.932 --> 30:34.974
Nervous?

30:36.393 --> 30:38.853
No, I'm... I'm good.

30:40.189 --> 30:42.440
You' re like a duck on a pond.

30:42.649 --> 30:45.485
On the surface, everything looks calm, but...

30:45.694 --> 30:49.072
beneath the water, those little feet
are just churning a mile a minute.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.866
You'll be fine.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.453
You just have to find a way to
lead your team, earn their respect.

30:56.163 --> 30:57.538
Yeah.

31:00.042 --> 31:01.584
How are you doing?

31:02.378 --> 31:03.669
Me?

31:05.339 --> 31:07.632
I'm just another duck on the pond.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.512
Hey, coach, can I ask you a question?

31:14.014 --> 31:16.391
- Yeah. shoot.
- Why me?

31:19.895 --> 31:22.605
I look at you, and I see two men.

31:22.815 --> 31:26.192
The man you are,
the man you ought to be.

31:26.402 --> 31:28.778
Someday, those two will meet.

31:29.113 --> 31:31.280
Should make for a hell of a football player.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.204
Get some sleep, kiddo.

31:38.747 --> 31:40.873
You're playing professional
football tomorrow.

31:57.975 --> 32:00.560
<i>Welcome to Nextel stadium
in our nation's capital.</i>

32:00.769 --> 32:03.646
I'm Pat Summerall, and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

32:03.856 --> 32:07.942
<i>Detroit went out and bought an entire
semi-pro team once the strike happened.</i>

32:08.152 --> 32:10.862
<i>Washington management
is going with a bunch of unknowns.</i>

32:11.071 --> 32:13.406
<i>Although we'll probably see
a few guys we know today.</i>

32:13.615 --> 32:17.000
<i>Like Shane Falco,
that talented college quarterback</i>

32:17.050 --> 32:19.829
<i>who fell out of sight after a disastrous
showing in the Sugar Bowl.</i>

32:26.211 --> 32:29.213
There's my man. Having a little
snacky-food before the game, are you?

32:29.423 --> 32:31.800
- It does a body good.
- You are one crazy son of a bitch.

32:31.850 --> 32:32.800
- Huh?
- Yeah.

32:32.850 --> 32:34.343
- You know how I know that?
- How?

32:34.553 --> 32:37.180
'Cause only a crazy son of a bitch
would eat eggs before a game!

32:37.639 --> 32:39.891
Come on, coach, gimme a break.
I need to bulk up. You want one?

32:40.100 --> 32:42.351
- No!
- It's good for you.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.239
All right, Sentinels, listen up.

32:56.992 --> 32:59.327
Welcome to professional football.

33:02.372 --> 33:04.916
There are some who will say
that your accomplishments today

33:05.125 --> 33:09.462
will soon be forgotten, that you're not
real players, that this isn't a real team.

33:09.671 --> 33:12.298
And I say that is bullshit!

33:12.508 --> 33:16.552
Because as of today,
you're all professional football players.

33:16.762 --> 33:20.640
You're being paid to play,
and I want you to remember that because...

33:20.849 --> 33:24.602
the men whose places you've taken
forgot that a long time ago.

33:25.562 --> 33:28.064
- All right, let's bring it in here.
- Bring it in, guys.

33:29.566 --> 33:31.275
Let's play some football!

33:31.485 --> 33:33.236
- <b>D.C.</b>
- Hooray!

33:33.529 --> 33:35.947
<i>For some of these players,
this is another shot.</i>

33:36.156 --> 33:38.157
<i>And a last shot for a guy like Falco.</i>

33:38.367 --> 33:40.743
<i>Remember that beating he took
from Florida state, John?</i>

33:40.953 --> 33:46.457
<i>Oh, yeah. But that's nothing compared to some
of those beatings that he took up there in Seattle.</i>

33:46.667 --> 33:49.919
<i>One thing we do know</i>
is that Falco can take a hit.

33:50.128 --> 33:53.589
<i>Well, I'll tell you,h e sure as heck
had a lot of practice at it.</i>

34:00.138 --> 34:04.559
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington Sentinels!</i>

34:10.732 --> 34:13.317
- Did you see that?
- Wow, that's a pretty good hit.

34:14.402 --> 34:18.864
<i>Will the medical trainers
please report to the east tunnel?</i>

34:23.411 --> 34:25.788
Maybe he was a little overanxious, huh?

34:28.500 --> 34:32.085
<i>And now, the rest of the
Washington Sentinels!</i>

34:53.609 --> 34:55.484
<b>Kickoff!</b>

35:02.367 --> 35:06.500
- Offense, let's go! Let's go!
- Let's go! Hustle out there, guys!

35:06.622 --> 35:10.249
There can only be one leader out there,
all right? You be it.

35:20.344 --> 35:22.470
- That's where I stand, man.
- No, it's not, man.

35:22.679 --> 35:25.014
- Come on, man, that's my spot in the huddle.
- It's not.

35:25.223 --> 35:27.892
- Get your spot, bro!
- Let's go, chopstick!

35:28.560 --> 35:30.603
Let's play some football!
What do you say?

35:36.360 --> 35:38.819
- It's my spot now!
- Not for long, you tub of rice!

35:39.029 --> 35:40.905
Hey, hold on. What's the problem here?

35:41.657 --> 35:43.741
You ain't kickin' jack shit!

35:43.950 --> 35:46.827
- Pork rice!
- I'm Japanese, not Chinese!

35:47.037 --> 35:48.579
Hey, man, don't be messin' with my brother!

35:48.789 --> 35:50.289
What the heck's goin' on down there?

35:50.499 --> 35:53.167
<i>I don't know. Something seems
to be going on in the huddle.</i>

35:55.629 --> 35:57.421
<i>Falco's on his back.</i>

35:57.631 --> 36:00.174
- Come on!
- <i>They haven't run a play yet, and Falco's down.</i>

36:00.384 --> 36:02.343
He got hit with a left hook by his own guy!

36:02.552 --> 36:07.098
He was looking at his earhole
for a minute. This isn't a good sign.

36:07.307 --> 36:11.268
- What happened? Am I hurt already?
- Your partner knocked your head off.

36:11.478 --> 36:13.229
Let's go, buddy.

36:14.690 --> 36:16.000
Come on, Shane, get it together!

36:16.100 --> 36:18.150
<i>Washington penalty, delay of game.</i>

36:18.360 --> 36:21.654
I'm the quarterback. I'm the only one
that's supposed to talk in the huddle.

36:21.863 --> 36:23.948
- But he was in my spot, Shane.
- I don't give a shit!

36:24.157 --> 36:25.658
Now huddle up.

36:29.621 --> 36:30.871
Hey!

36:31.415 --> 36:34.709
If you've got something to say,
raise your hand.

36:34.918 --> 36:36.377
Is that understood?

36:38.714 --> 36:40.923
Suppose, like, you don't feel good
or you're hurt, or something.

36:41.133 --> 36:44.135
Then tell me before the huddle starts. Okay?

36:44.344 --> 36:45.845
- Right.
- Okay, here we go.

36:46.054 --> 36:48.723
D.C. right, switch, 25 blast. It's up...

36:50.016 --> 36:51.434
What?

36:51.643 --> 36:53.269
- That's to the left, right?
- No, that's to the right.

36:53.478 --> 36:54.687
It's to the left!

36:57.566 --> 37:00.151
All right, Shane, you got to be quiet,
or they gonna hear us, and then what?

37:00.527 --> 37:02.820
I'm not blocking to nobody's defense.

37:03.905 --> 37:05.197
<i>Delay of game!</i>

37:05.407 --> 37:08.409
<i>Number 16 on the offense. 5 yards.</i>

37:09.119 --> 37:10.995
Well, Pat, so far the Sentinels

37:11.204 --> 37:14.165
have minus 10 yards offensively.

37:14.583 --> 37:17.960
I've seen monkey shit fights at the zoo
that were more organized than this.

37:20.422 --> 37:23.591
D.C. Right, pro, 4-24 tomahawk,
on one, on one. Ready?

37:32.684 --> 37:33.809
Ready?

37:34.686 --> 37:35.728
Green 22!

37:36.313 --> 37:37.855
I'm coming for you, Footsteps!

37:40.484 --> 37:42.067
Green 22!

37:42.778 --> 37:44.028
Hut! Hut!

37:46.865 --> 37:47.990
Come on, Shane! Come on!

37:52.412 --> 37:55.206
<i>You could hear Falco's fillings
drop all the way up here, Pat!</i>

37:55.415 --> 37:59.293
<i>And Detroit will take over the football
with excellent field position.</i>

37:59.503 --> 38:01.300
- Give me an S!
- <b>S!</b>

38:01.400 --> 38:02.755
- Give me an E!
- <b>E!</b>

38:02.964 --> 38:04.423
- Give me an N!
- <b>N!</b>

38:04.633 --> 38:06.050
- Give me a T!
- <b>T!</b>

38:06.259 --> 38:07.301
Give me an...

38:07.511 --> 38:09.053
- <b>l!</b>
- l!

38:10.000 --> 38:12.890
- <i>Fumble recovery. First down Detroit.</i>
- We'll get 'em next time, Shane.

38:13.683 --> 38:14.767
Get them! Get it!

38:15.519 --> 38:19.897
- Bring it in, team!
- Eagle over cover 4!

38:20.106 --> 38:21.398
On three, get ready!

38:22.000 --> 38:26.200
Bateman was all comin' out all day!
All day, blue eyes!

38:26.300 --> 38:28.500
It's Christmas morning,
and Santa's coming down the chimney!

38:28.550 --> 38:29.500
Ready!

38:29.550 --> 38:31.000
I'm gonna bury your family!

38:31.100 --> 38:33.410
- Cadillac 55!
- I'm gonna bury your dog!

38:34.746 --> 38:36.000
Check! Check!

38:40.710 --> 38:41.794
Now that's football!

38:42.003 --> 38:43.796
You get it?! You get it?! You like it?!

38:46.675 --> 38:50.261
<i>I think the Sentinels just set a record
for penalties in the first 3 minutes.</i>

38:50.470 --> 38:54.306
<i>- We're still waiting for the stats on that.
- Personal foul.</i>

38:54.516 --> 38:57.000
- <i>Number 56 on defense.</i>
- Bullshit!

38:57.100 --> 38:59.228
<i>Half the distance to the goal.</i>

38:59.437 --> 39:01.939
Bateman on that one, Pat,
that was just a cheap shot.

39:02.148 --> 39:04.000
<i>That should be worse than a penalty.</i>

39:04.100 --> 39:06.193
They're running up the middle too much.
They're walking right through us.

39:10.991 --> 39:12.408
<i>Touchdown Detroit!</i>

39:17.747 --> 39:18.998
Oh, honey, don't worry about it.

39:34.890 --> 39:36.265
Let's go!

39:41.771 --> 39:43.606
Double slot zag, 88...

39:43.815 --> 39:45.858
- What?
- I don't feel too good.

39:46.067 --> 39:48.068
- Come on, suck it up, huh?
- Come on!

39:48.737 --> 39:50.112
Jesus Christ.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.200
- Eggs!
- That's right!

39:56.250 --> 39:57.300
Jesus!

39:58.663 --> 40:00.080
What did you eat, man?

40:00.332 --> 40:03.334
Shane, we gots to move, man.
If we don't move, I'm gonna blow chow, too.

40:03.543 --> 40:07.296
We're in a huddle here.
Double slot zag, 88 slide...

40:09.591 --> 40:11.050
Jesus!

40:11.801 --> 40:13.177
- Goddamn!
- Hey, I tried to tell you, man.

40:13.386 --> 40:16.764
I can't be around somebody puking,
or I start puking.

40:17.307 --> 40:18.807
Shit.

40:19.768 --> 40:21.477
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

40:21.686 --> 40:23.145
On three...

40:24.105 --> 40:27.608
everyone move left.
Ready! Hut, hut, hut.

40:31.821 --> 40:33.739
What the hell is that?

40:34.449 --> 40:35.574
What the shit?

40:37.869 --> 40:40.746
<i>John, how many years
we've been calling games together?</i>

40:40.956 --> 40:43.374
- <i>19, I think.</i>
- Ever see anything like that?

40:46.503 --> 40:48.462
Not on a football field.

40:49.130 --> 40:51.423
- Leo, what the hell are your guys doing out there?
- Beats the hell out of me.

40:51.633 --> 40:55.719
Look at it this way. It's the first thing
we've done together as a team.

40:55.929 --> 40:58.472
- Hey!
- Clean it up! Let's go!

40:58.723 --> 41:00.099
<b>Break!</b>

41:13.405 --> 41:15.614
Ready! Blue 42!

41:18.576 --> 41:20.160
Blue 42!

41:21.663 --> 41:22.746
Hut!

41:36.500 --> 41:40.200
<i>Pass complete to number 34,
Walter Cochran.</i>

41:40.300 --> 41:42.474
<i>First down Washington.</i>

41:43.601 --> 41:45.477
- Was it out of bounds?
- Yes, on 23.

41:45.687 --> 41:47.146
23!

41:47.480 --> 41:51.483
- Blue right 60, x-post.
- Blue right 60, x-post.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.694
Let's go! Let's go!

41:54.404 --> 41:55.904
Gold 44! Hut!

42:10.378 --> 42:12.755
Yo, now we rollin'! Now we rollin'!

42:12.964 --> 42:15.174
<i>Signs of life from Washington here, John.</i>

42:15.383 --> 42:19.720
<i>Yeah, well, that last completion by Falco</i>
puts them back in field goal range.

42:19.929 --> 42:21.847
- Field goal, let's go, let's go!
- <b>Field goal.</b>

42:22.057 --> 42:23.557
Nigel! Nigel!

42:25.351 --> 42:30.022
It's over the bar, not under. Okay?
Go get 'em.

42:30.398 --> 42:33.000
- Hold that, wheezy.
- <i>And here comes the field goal team.</i>

42:33.100 --> 42:36.779
<i>This will be about a 40-yard attempt
for kicker Nigel Gruff against the wind.</i>

42:36.988 --> 42:42.284
<i>And here's a guy from Wales, and he's
out there kicking his first field goal ever.</i>

42:42.494 --> 42:43.744
<i>This is a tough distance.</i>

42:59.000 --> 43:02.638
Yes! Yeah, she's there! She's there!

43:03.264 --> 43:04.306
Boom! Boom!

43:04.516 --> 43:06.767
<i>Nigel Gruff's kick is good.</i>

43:06.976 --> 43:11.438
<i>Halftime score: Washington 3, Detroit 14.</i>

43:23.868 --> 43:26.745
<i>That's the second time tonight
a Washington player has been</i>

43:26.955 --> 43:30.249
- knocked out by his own teammate.
- You know, there's a rule in sports.

43:30.458 --> 43:33.836
"Don't do anything great,
if you can't handle the congratulations."

43:34.254 --> 43:35.838
- There is?
- Yup.

43:36.798 --> 43:38.298
- Give me an S!
- <i>S!</i>

43:38.550 --> 43:40.092
- Give me an E!
- <i>E!</i>

43:40.301 --> 43:41.802
- Give an N!
- <i>N!</i>

43:42.095 --> 43:44.054
- Give me a T!
- <i>T!</i>

43:44.264 --> 43:45.305
Give me a...

43:53.273 --> 43:54.982
Watch the wheel! Watch the wheel!

44:01.365 --> 44:04.825
All right! All right, let's go! Let's go, let's go!

44:12.709 --> 44:16.420
<i>Touchdown Smith. John, that one gets
the Sentinelsback into the ball game.</i>

44:16.629 --> 44:19.298
<i>I'll tell you, this guy is a heck of a player.
I don't know him.</i>

44:19.507 --> 44:22.384
<i>According to the Sentinels here,
it says Ray Smith is...</i>

44:22.594 --> 44:25.387
<i>Hey, that's weird!
No college given, no high school.</i>

44:25.597 --> 44:28.265
<i>It just says he's been a resident
of the state of Maryland</i>

44:28.474 --> 44:31.602
<i>for that last 2 years and 2 months</i>
and he likes... to embroider.

44:31.811 --> 44:34.605
- He does some fancy work with the ball, all right.
- Weird, man!

44:41.696 --> 44:42.863
Ready!

44:46.409 --> 44:47.576
Green 11!

44:48.244 --> 44:50.537
Green 11! Hut!

44:56.044 --> 44:58.545
<i>Falco's sacked, and the ball comes loose.</i>

44:58.755 --> 45:01.757
<i>It's Detroit's ball with only a minute
remaining in the game.</i>

45:02.000 --> 45:04.426
- <i>Fumble recovery. First down Detroit.</i>
- Let's go! Let's go!

45:05.345 --> 45:06.970
- Let's get some!
- Danny, Danny, Danny!

45:07.347 --> 45:10.515
- I need that ball. Get me the ball.
- You need the ball.

45:10.892 --> 45:12.267
- Get me the ball.
- Get you the ball.

45:12.477 --> 45:13.977
- Are you gonna get me the ball?
- I'm gonna get you the ball!

45:14.187 --> 45:17.438
I want that ball! I want that ball!
You go get it!

45:18.983 --> 45:20.817
I hope he doesn't kill somebody.

45:22.904 --> 45:24.821
I'm back! I'm back!

45:25.031 --> 45:26.615
Get the ball!

45:42.882 --> 45:44.716
I got it!

45:44.926 --> 45:47.219
<i>Now that is all-Madden team.</i>

45:47.428 --> 45:48.887
- You're the man!
- I'm the man!

45:49.097 --> 45:50.650
- You got me the ball!
- I got you the ball!

45:50.700 --> 45:51.848
- You got the ball!
- I got the ball!

45:52.058 --> 45:55.310
- You got me the ball!
- I got you the ball!

45:58.398 --> 46:00.482
- Go sit down now, Danny.
- Okay.

46:02.110 --> 46:04.403
<i>Number 56 Daniel Bateman
recovers the ball.</i>

46:04.612 --> 46:06.822
- Falco!
- <i>First down Washington.</i>

46:07.031 --> 46:09.366
Okay, we got to pass, all right?
It's got to be in the end zone.

46:09.575 --> 46:12.995
D.C. Right, zig, 90 eagle. Eagle.
You can do this, now, come on.

46:13.204 --> 46:16.832
All right? Let's do it. Come on!

46:20.169 --> 46:21.461
On 2, on 2. Ready!

46:27.302 --> 46:28.635
Ready!

46:29.512 --> 46:32.139
- Blue 25!
- Here comes the pain, baby!

46:32.348 --> 46:34.642
Blue 25!

46:37.603 --> 46:39.146
- Check, check!
- What are you doing?

46:39.689 --> 46:41.231
Check!

46:41.816 --> 46:44.318
- Pump back, pump back.
- Black 32!

46:44.527 --> 46:46.320
- What does that mean?
- He's changing the play, listen.

46:46.529 --> 46:48.780
He's checking off to run. I told him to pass.

46:49.073 --> 46:50.407
Black 32!

46:53.661 --> 46:54.745
Shit!

46:55.513 --> 46:57.205
Hut! Hut!

47:20.313 --> 47:22.731
<i>Falco calls an audible
at the line of scrimmage,</i>

47:22.940 --> 47:25.275
<i>and Cochran nearly takes it in
for a touchdown.</i>

47:25.485 --> 47:27.611
What a heartbreaker for Washington.

47:36.120 --> 47:39.581
- <i>Final score: Washington 10, Detroit 14.</i>
- Shane!

47:39.791 --> 47:43.001
If I'd have wanted Cochran to have
that ball, I would have called it that way.

47:43.211 --> 47:44.836
- I read blitz.
- Bullshit!

47:45.046 --> 47:48.006
I put the game in your hands.
You got scared.

47:48.216 --> 47:49.383
I read blitz.

47:53.971 --> 47:56.973
Winners always want the ball
when the game's on the line.

48:33.300 --> 48:36.000
<i>This is W.F.A.N., the sports fan's show
for Greater D.C. You're on the line.</i>

48:36.100 --> 48:37.250
<i>How do you feel about that strike?</i>

48:37.400 --> 48:39.000
<i>Now, the only ones getting
screwed are the fans.</i>

48:39.100 --> 48:42.060
<i>Now, I got season tickets to the Sents
that I can't give away!</i>

48:42.270 --> 48:44.400
<i>Okay, so what? You're not gonna
check out these replacement players?</i>

48:44.450 --> 48:45.981
<i>What for? They're a bunch of nobodies!</i>

48:53.948 --> 48:56.908
# First I was afraid
I was petrified #

48:57.118 --> 49:01.788
# Kept thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side #

49:06.961 --> 49:09.337
Man, why you play that dumb-ass song?

49:09.547 --> 49:12.215
I put on "The Commodores".
That shit just came on.

49:12.425 --> 49:14.843
Can somebody please cut that bullshit off?

49:15.052 --> 49:18.000
Hey, we did the best we can do.
That's all we can do.

49:18.100 --> 49:19.723
You don't get points for trying.

49:19.932 --> 49:22.350
Let's face it, boys,
we screwed the pooch today.

49:25.438 --> 49:27.439
Hey, there they are!

49:27.690 --> 49:29.149
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:29.358 --> 49:32.402
your Washington Sentinels!

49:35.406 --> 49:38.575
Hell, he's the luckiest guy here.
At least he couldn't hear the booing today.

49:41.370 --> 49:44.039
Hello! Anyone home?
Did I hear an echo?

49:44.790 --> 49:47.375
Hey, Rainman, where'd Mcginty get you,
the Special Olympics?

49:47.668 --> 49:50.700
No wonder they couldn't win the game
today. He can't even order a drink!

49:53.174 --> 49:55.008
Hey, Shane.

49:56.385 --> 49:58.094
- Lay off.
- Lighten up, Falco.

49:58.304 --> 50:00.805
- It's not like he can hear what I'm saying.
- I can.

50:06.562 --> 50:08.230
What's that say?

50:08.689 --> 50:12.442
"There's one good thing about being deaf.
It makes it easy to ignore the assholes."

50:13.861 --> 50:16.905
You... asshole.

50:18.491 --> 50:19.533
That's funny.

50:22.370 --> 50:25.372
- Hey, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

50:25.623 --> 50:27.290
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

50:30.044 --> 50:32.462
- You had enough?
- Do you believe this?

50:32.672 --> 50:35.757
You got balls, Falco. You got shit
for brains, but you got balls.

50:35.967 --> 50:37.008
Thank you.

50:37.218 --> 50:38.343
Hey!

50:39.053 --> 50:42.597
Danny! Remember what I told you
about red shirts in practice?

50:42.807 --> 50:44.182
- Yeah.
- Forget about it.

50:44.850 --> 50:46.810
- Okay.
- Martel.

50:53.901 --> 50:57.320
Who's the man?! Who's the man?!

50:57.530 --> 50:59.155
Come on! Come on!

51:04.203 --> 51:06.246
Come on! Come on! Stop!

51:07.957 --> 51:10.000
Let's play football, bitch.

51:15.006 --> 51:17.090
We are all god's children here, please!

51:29.937 --> 51:34.024
"And deliver thee
into the hands of brutish men"!

51:39.864 --> 51:42.000
Ezekiel 21:31.

51:47.121 --> 51:48.705
Same old bullshit.

51:48.914 --> 51:51.082
I think it'd be more of a homecoming for you.

51:51.292 --> 51:53.209
Oh, now all of a sudden
you gonna be a funny man?

51:53.419 --> 51:56.463
Hey, Bateman, Wilkinson!
Hey, come on, guys, what are you doing?

51:57.673 --> 52:00.300
Come on, can't we all just get along?

52:02.720 --> 52:03.887
Come on.

52:04.096 --> 52:07.098
What I want to know,
why are we the only ones in this jail?

52:07.308 --> 52:10.602
- It's simple. They're winners.
- Hell, no. Not tonight.

52:10.811 --> 52:14.439
That was pretty sweet the way
you sat on Wilson's head, Jumbo.

52:15.691 --> 52:16.733
Thanks, Jamal.

52:23.699 --> 52:25.825
Fumiko wasn't the only one that
kicked some ass tonight, was he?

52:26.035 --> 52:28.411
Oh, you're the man tonight, Clifford Franklin!

52:30.164 --> 52:33.124
- What?
- You were hiding behind the jukebox.

52:33.334 --> 52:34.626
Wasn't he?

52:35.500 --> 52:36.700
Hey, man...

52:37.296 --> 52:41.007
At first, I admit, I was afraid.

52:41.842 --> 52:45.011
- Shit, I was petrified.
- You were petrified?

52:45.221 --> 52:47.681
Thinking I could never live
without you by my side.

52:49.016 --> 52:52.185
- The Lord is by your side.
- Have mercy.

52:52.395 --> 52:56.272
And then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong.

52:58.526 --> 53:00.193
A¤d I grew strong.

53:00.403 --> 53:02.612
You know I hate this damn song.

53:02.822 --> 53:05.532
# I learned how to get along
and so you're back #

53:05.741 --> 53:07.659
# From outer space #

53:07.868 --> 53:11.621
# I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face #

53:11.831 --> 53:16.042
# I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key #

53:16.252 --> 53:20.130
# If I'd have known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me #

53:20.339 --> 53:21.840
# Go on, now, go #

53:22.049 --> 53:23.675
# Walk out the door #

53:24.301 --> 53:25.677
# Just turn around now #

53:26.303 --> 53:28.096
# 'Cause you're not welcome anymore #

53:28.472 --> 53:29.514
You remember this here?

53:29.724 --> 53:32.350
# Weren't you the one that tried
to hurt me with good-bye? #

53:32.810 --> 53:34.436
# You think I'd crumble? #

53:34.645 --> 53:37.021
# You think I'd lay down and die #

53:37.231 --> 53:40.024
# Oh, no, not I
I will survive #

53:41.360 --> 53:45.530
# As long as I know how to love
I know how to stay alive #

53:45.740 --> 53:49.534
# I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give #

53:49.744 --> 53:52.287
# And I'll survive
I will survive #

53:53.289 --> 53:55.415
# Hey, hey! #

54:10.723 --> 54:13.516
# It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart #

54:13.726 --> 54:17.687
# Kept trying hard to mend
the pieces of my broken heart #

54:17.897 --> 54:22.025
# And I spent, oh, so many nights
just feelin' sorry for myself #

54:22.234 --> 54:26.112
# I used to cry
And now I hold my head up high #

54:26.405 --> 54:27.530
# And you see me #

54:36.707 --> 54:37.832
Franklin.

54:40.211 --> 54:41.711
Oh, shit.

54:43.255 --> 54:46.800
I want you to know that if anything
like this bar fight happens again,

54:47.009 --> 54:50.011
there'll be no place on the football team
for any of you!

54:51.305 --> 54:54.641
- Do I make myself perfectly clear?
- Yes, sir.

54:54.850 --> 54:56.893
And just for the record...

54:57.645 --> 55:01.147
I would've loved to have been there
to see Martel get his ass kicked.

55:01.315 --> 55:02.357
All right, come on, let's get out of here.

55:10.324 --> 55:11.783
Hey, Shane.

55:12.201 --> 55:15.203
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

55:15.412 --> 55:17.121
My job.

55:17.748 --> 55:21.543
- You're a professional football player.
- Sure. This week.

55:21.752 --> 55:24.295
But when that's all over, you know...

55:24.505 --> 55:28.091
I'll be back here.
I don't want to lose my customers.

55:29.677 --> 55:32.679
Well, I was on my way to work.
I thought maybe you might need a ride.

55:32.972 --> 55:34.889
Oh, I'm good.

55:35.099 --> 55:38.810
- I got my truck back.
- How is it?

55:39.019 --> 55:42.355
Flatter. But it runs.

55:44.483 --> 55:48.069
And you? How are you
running after last night?

55:49.697 --> 55:51.072
You heard about that?

55:51.282 --> 55:53.408
Yeah. I think the whole
town heard about that.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.869
Is that from the game or from the fight?

55:56.161 --> 56:00.331
I'm not sure. It's all kind of blurred
into one big beating.

56:01.667 --> 56:04.002
The good news is,
you guys got into a rhythm out there.

56:04.211 --> 56:07.714
Apart from that vomiting thing,
which was on "Sportscenter" by the way.

56:08.173 --> 56:09.799
Oh, God!

56:10.217 --> 56:12.468
But after that, the team was really clicking.

56:14.388 --> 56:16.472
Yeah, it was starting to come together.

56:16.682 --> 56:18.099
Yeah.

56:19.977 --> 56:22.478
- You want to sit down?
- No, I should go.

56:24.023 --> 56:26.441
- Thanks for coming by.
- Yeah.

56:28.700 --> 56:29.700
What?

56:31.739 --> 56:32.989
Jesus!

56:33.198 --> 56:36.034
- Oh, it looks worse than it feels.
- Oh, it looks like hell.

56:36.577 --> 56:39.913
- Oh, then it looks exactly like it feels.
- Oh, here, I've...

56:43.000 --> 56:44.208
"Wild yam"?

56:44.418 --> 56:45.500
Yeah.

56:46.128 --> 56:51.424
Don't laugh, it works. It's great
for sore muscles and bruises and...

56:51.634 --> 56:54.761
- I use it all the time.
- You don't have to do that.

56:54.970 --> 56:57.000
Are you gonna put it on?
You can barely move.

56:57.100 --> 56:58.848
Okay, now, this is going to be a little bit...

56:59.058 --> 57:02.101
- Cold!
- Sorry, sorry.

57:03.311 --> 57:05.229
Here, on your shoulders.

57:08.484 --> 57:09.692
Better?

57:09.902 --> 57:11.111
Better.

57:21.205 --> 57:23.581
You know, you're the first player
I can remember who seems

57:23.791 --> 57:26.501
to care more about his teammates
than he does himself.

57:28.087 --> 57:31.965
And that's something that this team's
been missing for a really long time.

57:33.300 --> 57:35.885
It's a good thing you did last night.

57:36.303 --> 57:37.887
It was stupid.

57:40.975 --> 57:42.100
Thanks.

57:46.355 --> 57:48.940
- I'm gonna to be late for work.
- You got practice?

57:49.149 --> 57:50.525
No, actually, I have work.

57:50.943 --> 57:54.904
We only make 50 bucks a game,
so we got to pay the bills, right?

57:55.114 --> 57:58.574
Mac's, down on "A" street.
Come in. I'll buy you a beer.

57:59.201 --> 58:00.868
All right. I'll do that.

58:01.370 --> 58:02.870
Okay.

58:04.248 --> 58:06.124
Keep putting that yam on.

58:23.767 --> 58:25.184
Guys!

58:33.485 --> 58:35.194
You got to be kidding.

58:35.404 --> 58:37.447
Come on, Martel, I didn't park in your space.ace.

58:37.656 --> 58:39.532
No, no, no.

58:39.742 --> 58:42.577
But unfortunately you did park
in Lamont's space.

58:42.953 --> 58:45.000
He's not nearly as lenient as I am.

58:45.200 --> 58:47.206
On three, fellas.

58:47.458 --> 58:49.709
One, two, three!

58:55.049 --> 58:59.010
- We got this. We got this.
- Y'all want to put the car back?

58:59.219 --> 59:01.179
This is none of your business, gentlemen.

59:01.889 --> 59:03.306
Shane's our business.

59:03.515 --> 59:06.225
- We're the guards.
- And we protect our quarterback.

59:08.979 --> 59:12.398
This is funny to these bozos.
You got a joke? You got a joke?

59:12.775 --> 59:15.068
That's your ride right there, ain't it?

59:16.070 --> 59:17.570
Yeah.

59:22.618 --> 59:25.078
- That's my windshield, you crazy mother...
- Put the car back!

59:25.287 --> 59:26.537
Son of a bitch!

59:27.456 --> 59:28.915
Son of a...

59:29.124 --> 59:32.627
Oh, son of a bitch! Oh, l'm a son
of a bitch? Son of a bitch?!

59:34.838 --> 59:36.380
Stop, stop, stop!

59:36.590 --> 59:38.382
All right, come on, goddamn it, help me!

59:39.468 --> 59:41.010
You're gonna pay for this!

59:41.220 --> 59:45.348
No, I'm not. And stop messing
with my man. That includes his ride.

59:45.557 --> 59:46.933
Matter of fact, wax that motherfucker.

59:47.518 --> 59:49.602
Give it a tune-up, too.

59:51.146 --> 59:53.231
Ready to go to practice, Shane?

59:53.440 --> 59:55.300
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah.

59:55.359 --> 59:57.777
- How's that arm?
- Good.

59:58.445 --> 01:00:00.863
- What's that smell?
- Wild yam.

01:00:01.073 --> 01:00:03.866
- Mm. That's nice.
- You like that?

01:00:04.076 --> 01:00:05.118
Watch yourself, Shane.

01:00:05.327 --> 01:00:09.455
And so, boys and girls,
if anybody does have any firearms,

01:00:09.665 --> 01:00:12.291
you need to turn those in
as soon as possible.

01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:13.835
No questions asked, now.

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.921
Understood?

01:00:23.262 --> 01:00:24.637
All right.

01:00:24.847 --> 01:00:27.098
Okay, coach, it's all yours.

01:00:29.351 --> 01:00:30.935
Nigel. Nigel.

01:00:34.314 --> 01:00:40.778
Last sunday, I saw a team on the field play
as hard as they could to win a football game.

01:00:40.988 --> 01:00:44.866
We lost. Not because of effort or desire,

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:49.328
but because of lack of leadership, lack of trust.
One of those issues has been resolved.

01:00:49.538 --> 01:00:53.166
But leadership means nothing,
if a team doesn't believe in each other.

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:57.044
Players spend years together
before they develop trust in one another.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:01:00.715
I'm asking you to do it in a week.
Not a reasonable request, but...

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:03.384
these aren't reasonable times.

01:01:04.178 --> 01:01:08.222
Now, I know you all have concerns
about this Sunday.

01:01:11.852 --> 01:01:13.644
But a real man...

01:01:16.857 --> 01:01:18.191
...admits his fears.

01:01:20.694 --> 01:01:23.613
That's what I'm asking you to do here tonight.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.743
Who wants to start?
Fears, let's talk about them.

01:01:29.494 --> 01:01:30.912
Fears. Fears.

01:01:36.668 --> 01:01:38.252
I'm scared of spiders, coach.

01:01:40.756 --> 01:01:43.674
- That's not what I meant.
- Me, too, coach. I'm afraid of spiders, too, coach.

01:01:43.884 --> 01:01:47.470
Yeah. Goddamn spiders freak me, too, fellas.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.348
Well, I didn't mean that, though.
What I'm talking about--

01:01:50.557 --> 01:01:53.643
Especially in your bed, man. Ever get one
of those spiders crawling up your arm, man?

01:01:53.852 --> 01:01:55.770
- And they be crawling on you?
- Damn!

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:59.232
Thanks, Jumbo. You can just
rock me to sleep tonight.

01:02:00.275 --> 01:02:03.000
Okay, that's great, but that's
not what I'm talking about.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.072
What l'm talking about is
what scares us on the field.

01:02:06.281 --> 01:02:08.199
What do you mean?
Like spiders on the field?

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:11.369
Can we get beyond the spiders, please?

01:02:12.913 --> 01:02:14.330
Bees.

01:02:14.539 --> 01:02:15.623
Bees?

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.208
- Bees?!
- Bees.

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:19.252
Yeah, l don't know about them bees.

01:02:19.461 --> 01:02:23.547
Anybody here afraid of anything
other than insects? Huh?

01:02:23.757 --> 01:02:25.258
Come on!

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:26.717
Quicksand.

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:31.305
Oh, shit, yeah!
Hey, quicksand's a scary mother, man.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:34.000
I mean, first of all, it suck you right in,
and even if you scream,

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.100
- you get all that muck in your mouth--
- All right, all right.

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:36.800
I don't think that's what Shane
had in mind, Franklin.

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:37.800
Huh?

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.481
That's not what he had in mind.

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.442
- What you talking about then, coach?
- Well, why don't you ask him?

01:02:46.571 --> 01:02:48.447
Hey, what's up, Shane?

01:02:50.575 --> 01:02:52.285
You're playing...

01:02:52.494 --> 01:02:56.664
And you think everything is going fine,
but then one thing goes wrong.

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.582
And then another...

01:02:59.418 --> 01:03:00.710
And another...

01:03:00.919 --> 01:03:06.090
And you try to fight back, but the harder
you fight, the deeper you sink,

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.092
till you can't move.

01:03:09.678 --> 01:03:11.220
You can't breathe.

01:03:12.806 --> 01:03:14.765
Because you're in over your head.

01:03:17.185 --> 01:03:18.853
Like quicksand.

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:28.571
That's deep shit, Shane.
That's some deep shit!

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:34.368
Anything else you're afraid of?

01:03:35.704 --> 01:03:38.039
- Going back to the mini-mart.
- The shipping yard.

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:39.540
The auto plant.

01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:41.459
Prison.

01:03:42.169 --> 01:03:43.753
Yeah, all right.

01:03:48.508 --> 01:03:51.218
The truth is, you guys
have been given something

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:53.387
that every athlete dreams of...

01:03:54.681 --> 01:03:56.515
A second chance.

01:03:57.184 --> 01:03:58.726
And you're afraid of blowing it.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:00.811
We all are.

01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:03.981
We all are, but now our fear is shared
and we can overcome it together.

01:04:04.358 --> 01:04:07.985
Let's lose that fear this Sunday
and put it into San Diego!

01:04:08.695 --> 01:04:09.904
Come on!

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:22.166
<i>There's another vicious hit
by the All-Pro Hank Morris.</i>

01:04:22.376 --> 01:04:24.210
<i>That's his third of the game.</i>

01:04:24.419 --> 01:04:25.961
It's just me, dickhead.

01:04:26.171 --> 01:04:29.298
<i>I tell you, he is really putting
a hurt on Falco, Pat.</i>

01:04:29.508 --> 01:04:32.385
I'm not sure how much more
of this abuse he can take.

01:04:33.887 --> 01:04:35.950
Huddle up! Huddle up!

01:04:36.681 --> 01:04:38.474
<i>Second and 10.</i>

01:04:38.683 --> 01:04:41.143
Same play. Except let Morris by.
Nobody touch him.

01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:43.562
- What?!
- It's 16-0 already!

01:04:43.772 --> 01:04:45.898
I said let him through!
On 2, on 2. Ready. Break!

01:04:48.068 --> 01:04:50.986
Get some penetration, Morris!
Get some penetration!

01:04:51.196 --> 01:04:52.988
Blue 80!

01:04:54.408 --> 01:04:56.158
Hut, hut!

01:05:06.628 --> 01:05:07.962
Now, that is a hit!

01:05:12.175 --> 01:05:15.010
- Holy shit!
- Let's haul ass, round boy!

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.512
Follow me! Follow me!

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:23.811
Holy shit! Holy shit!

01:05:26.273 --> 01:05:27.690
Go!

01:05:28.442 --> 01:05:29.692
Jump on his back!

01:05:30.277 --> 01:05:32.403
Here it comes! I'm coming through!

01:05:33.447 --> 01:05:34.822
Jump on his back!

01:05:39.453 --> 01:05:41.620
<i>Fumiko scores! Fumiko scores!</i>

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:44.123
I love to see a fat guy score.

01:05:44.332 --> 01:05:45.666
Why?

01:05:45.876 --> 01:05:49.962
<i>Well, because you get a fat guy spike,
and then you get a fat guy dance.</i>

01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:55.468
- Pork rice!
- Yeah!

01:06:00.098 --> 01:06:02.391
I don't remember that from the play book.

01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:05.478
- Yeah.
- Maybe we should put it in.

01:06:09.774 --> 01:06:11.150
Kickoff!

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:45.059
So, Annabelle, what do you,
like, think of our friends?

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:47.436
I think...

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:50.300
...they're friendly.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.274
I know. Aren't they?

01:06:52.484 --> 01:06:53.609
Yeah.

01:07:05.372 --> 01:07:08.123
We'll stretch them.
We'll stretch them right here.

01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:13.212
Green 95!

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.464
Green....

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:17.466
Green...

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:19.635
...95!

01:07:19.844 --> 01:07:21.512
What the hell?

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.021
Start the ball! Get the ball off!

01:07:32.732 --> 01:07:33.774
Hold the play clock.

01:07:39.906 --> 01:07:41.657
Start the ball on the play clock.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Hut!

01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:45.500
Oh, shit!

01:07:49.249 --> 01:07:51.417
<i>False start on the offense.</i>

01:07:51.626 --> 01:07:57.400
<i>Number 72, number 77, number 60,
number 61, number 87 and number 53.</i>

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.500
Yeah.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.927
<i>Five yards. Still first down.</i>

01:08:02.137 --> 01:08:06.223
That's bullshit! The one girl slapped
the other girl on the ass, Jimmy!

01:08:06.433 --> 01:08:07.600
You're killing me!

01:08:08.101 --> 01:08:10.853
You want to see mine?
Baby, l got something for you.

01:08:18.444 --> 01:08:20.571
- Here we go!
- Don't throw it!

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:26.160
No! No! No!

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Tackle him!

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:31.122
Damn it! They did it again!

01:08:32.292 --> 01:08:35.002
<i>Ray Smith with the interception.</i>

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.337
<i>First down, Washington.</i>

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:41.634
- Nice going!
- You are killing me!

01:08:41.843 --> 01:08:43.926
- Defense, get out there!
- Let's go!

01:08:46.848 --> 01:08:49.558
Stop them from shaking their ass
for two minutes!

01:08:51.144 --> 01:08:54.772
- 98 shake.
- 98 shake, come on!

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.609
Green 99!

01:09:00.528 --> 01:09:01.612
Hut!

01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:03.529
Blitz! Blitz!

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.925
- Not bad, Falco.
- Yeah!

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:28.430
<i>Touchdown, Brian Murphy!</i>

01:09:30.725 --> 01:09:33.200
<i>Well, it's safe to say that everybody
in the stadium knows</i>

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:36.729
<i>that an on-side kick is coming
with 55 seconds left on the clock.</i>

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:40.776
<i>Now with just 55 seconds left,
Washington has to recover the ball,</i>

01:09:40.984 --> 01:09:45.238
<i>call a time-out real fast, so that Gruff
will have a shot at a field goal.</i>

01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:53.413
<i>Big ol' Bateman ends up with the ball!</i>

01:09:53.665 --> 01:09:55.332
Danny, go down!

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:58.961
<i>No one's gonna tackle him!
He's reversing his field!</i>

01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:01.046
<i>Maybe he forgot the clock's running out.</i>

01:10:01.256 --> 01:10:03.757
<i>He's trying to run out the clock.</i>

01:10:04.134 --> 01:10:07.219
Danny, go down!
You're using up the clock, Danny!

01:10:09.723 --> 01:10:13.016
- There is something you won't see every day.
- <i>You're right about that!</i>

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.603
Nice hit, Shane! Nice hit!

01:10:18.398 --> 01:10:19.450
What do you think?

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:22.400
We got time for one play.
We don't stop the clock, it's over.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.445
Give me a chance, boss. I'm bored.

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:27.322
You're looking at a 65-yard
field goal here, Nigel.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.702
You just hold it, Shane,
and I'll kick the bloody piss out of it.

01:10:34.164 --> 01:10:36.582
- What the hell.
- What the hell!

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.584
<b>Field goal!</b>

01:10:45.759 --> 01:10:50.053
<i>McGinty's gonna let Gruff try
this field goal from 65 yards out!</i>

01:10:50.263 --> 01:10:54.266
<i>I don't know if he has enough leg.</i>
I think that guy's smoking on the field!

01:10:54.476 --> 01:10:56.852
<i>Smoking?
I'm sure you just imagined that, John.</i>

01:10:57.061 --> 01:11:00.105
<i>No, no, I saw it!
I saw the smoke and everything.</i>

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Laces out!

01:11:12.619 --> 01:11:14.369
- Hey, Vito, look who's on TV.
- Bingo!

01:11:14.579 --> 01:11:17.998
He wants to keep his pub,
he's gonna start blowing some kicks.

01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:20.709
I'm telling you, that's him.

01:11:24.005 --> 01:11:25.172
All right!

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.972
Set!

01:11:46.319 --> 01:11:49.613
<i>It's straight enough.
It's got the distance.</i>

01:11:49.823 --> 01:11:53.242
<i>It has the distance!
It's good! Washington wins!</i>

01:11:55.870 --> 01:12:00.082
<i>65-yard field goal attempt
is good by Nigel Gruff!</i>

01:12:03.336 --> 01:12:08.298
<i>Final score: Washington 17, San Diego 16.</i>

01:12:12.971 --> 01:12:14.471
Yeah!

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:18.350
- You the man! You the man!
- Bollocks!

01:12:22.188 --> 01:12:23.689
Come here!

01:12:27.193 --> 01:12:29.361
Sorry, mate. Sorry. Excuse me.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:32.823
All right. Good game.
We snuck by on that one.

01:12:33.032 --> 01:12:34.825
- I'll take it.
- All right.

01:12:35.034 --> 01:12:37.369
I'll take it. Congrats.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.126
<i>- What do you think about the new team?
- What do I think? I think it's great.</i>

01:12:44.335 --> 01:12:45.878
<i>You know, these guys are like us, you know?</i>

01:12:46.087 --> 01:12:48.000
<i>This strike ain't about guys like me.</i>

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.400
<i>It's about them hotshot superstars
who want $8 million instead of 7.</i>

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.051
<i>You know what I say to that?
To hell with them!</i>

01:12:53.261 --> 01:12:56.179
<i>This is the most fun I've had
in football in years. Go Falco!</i>

01:12:56.389 --> 01:12:58.390
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.727
- Hey!
- All right. Let's go, baby, let's go!

01:13:01.936 --> 01:13:05.898
- I love you, Annabelle.
- I know you do, Alan. We're closed.

01:13:07.358 --> 01:13:08.775
Oh, hey.

01:13:09.569 --> 01:13:11.528
- No, you can come in.
- Come on in, buddy!

01:13:11.738 --> 01:13:13.238
You go.

01:13:13.573 --> 01:13:14.865
Out, out, out, out!

01:13:15.074 --> 01:13:16.325
You're Shane Falco!

01:13:17.118 --> 01:13:19.700
Way to go, Falco. You guys kicked ass.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.800
- Thanks.
- Out!

01:13:20.955 --> 01:13:24.625
- Way to go.
- All right, see you. Bye! Take care.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:26.084
Hi.

01:13:27.128 --> 01:13:30.839
You sure it's okay? I don't want to
get you in trouble with your boss.

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:34.843
Oh, no. She won't mind.

01:13:35.053 --> 01:13:38.263
- Come on in. You want a beer?
- Sure.

01:13:39.599 --> 01:13:43.393
So, we were so tight.
We had so much fun in here.

01:13:43.603 --> 01:13:46.772
Since I was 5 years old,
I've been sitting on those stools.

01:13:48.441 --> 01:13:51.818
And then, after he died, I took over.

01:13:53.112 --> 01:13:54.738
Is that you and him?

01:13:56.658 --> 01:13:58.200
Yeah.

01:13:59.494 --> 01:14:02.412
He was the biggest Washington fan
you have ever seen.

01:14:02.622 --> 01:14:06.541
Other kids were getting bedtime stories,
I got football stories.

01:14:10.505 --> 01:14:13.465
He used to talk all the time
about the glory days -

01:14:13.675 --> 01:14:16.176
Thank you. - of football.

01:14:16.386 --> 01:14:20.389
Said how they were gone forever.

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:23.642
I wish he was here to see you guys play.

01:14:26.312 --> 01:14:28.355
- I don't know about that.
- I do.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:31.274
- Good game today.
- Thanks.

01:14:44.622 --> 01:14:45.872
It's late.

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:49.167
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:54.548
- Us babies need our rest.
- Yeah, you do.

01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:57.718
I'm sorry about that. You know,
between the guys on the field

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:01.013
and the guys in the bar,
a girl's gotta keep her guard up.

01:15:01.222 --> 01:15:03.849
- Yeah, l imagine.
- Yeah.

01:15:06.519 --> 01:15:08.645
You coming to the game on Sunday?

01:15:08.855 --> 01:15:11.064
Nah, we don't travel with the team.

01:15:14.902 --> 01:15:17.988
Well, can I see you when I get back?

01:15:20.366 --> 01:15:21.616
Sure.

01:15:25.913 --> 01:15:27.706
Good night, Annabelle.

01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:30.459

<i>- What do you do here, John?
- You go for it, Pat. You have to.</i>

01:16:20.301 --> 01:16:24.471
<i>But Falco's been shut down
by this defense all afternoon.</i>

01:16:28.142 --> 01:16:34.106
<i>Yeah, well, I'll tell you this. All it takes is one
big play to get him back in the ball game.</i>

01:16:36.818 --> 01:16:39.069
<i>And here goes Falco.</i>

01:16:39.529 --> 01:16:49.400
<b> <i>Falco!</b></i>

01:16:49.497 --> 01:16:52.624
<i>Falco scores! Falco scores!</i>

01:16:54.001 --> 01:16:55.127
Yeah!

01:16:58.714 --> 01:17:03.635
Now here's Falco, and he's gonna try and
reverse pivot and turn and pitch out here.

01:17:03.886 --> 01:17:07.931
But in doing so, his left guard,
André Jackson, is going to pull,

01:17:08.141 --> 01:17:11.059
and Falco is going to hit him
with the ball right in the back.

01:17:11.269 --> 01:17:13.979
Doink! Then it's going to flop
around on the ground here.

01:17:14.188 --> 01:17:16.200
Here's gonna come Cochran,
he's gonna come across,

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.800
he's gonna kick it,
Franklin's gonna pick it up.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.110
Franklin's gonna get hit right here.

01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:23.071
Frap! The ball's gonna go flying in the air,

01:17:23.281 --> 01:17:25.490
and then here comes Falco,
he's gonna pick it up,

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:28.400
and the guy who started the play, Falco,

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.621
is going to end up with it
in the end zone for a touchdown!

01:17:31.831 --> 01:17:34.833
- Welcome to strike football.
- And the fabulous Falco.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:36.793
<i>If they can win next week against Dallas,</i>

01:17:37.003 --> 01:17:41.173
<i>they'll do something that Washington
has not been able to do in over 7 years.</i>

01:17:41.382 --> 01:17:42.883
<i>Get to the playoffs.</i>

01:17:47.847 --> 01:17:49.050
Come on.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.000
<i>Pass incomplete.</i>

01:17:51.684 --> 01:17:52.893
Shit!

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:56.188
- Call time out! Time out!
- Time out, time out, time out!

01:17:56.397 --> 01:17:58.523
- <i>Time out, Washington.</i>
- Shake it off.

01:17:58.733 --> 01:18:01.234
Franklin, come here, come here, come here.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:03.987
- I thought I had it and then the ball--
- Hey, shut up! Give me the Stick'em.

01:18:04.906 --> 01:18:05.947
Damn.

01:18:06.532 --> 01:18:09.409
- Coach, ain't that stuff illegal?
- What are they gonna do, put you in football jail?

01:18:09.869 --> 01:18:12.245
Now, you know this don't look natural.
You know it, don't you?

01:18:12.455 --> 01:18:16.333
Don't talk! We're gonna run the same play.
Do you hear me? You're gonna catch the ball.

01:18:16.876 --> 01:18:20.462
- Coach, I look like I just jacked off an elephant.
- Hey, say you understand!

01:18:21.339 --> 01:18:22.380
I understand.

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:25.000
Okay. Now, go out there and catch
a ball for a change, all right?

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.803
- All right.
- All right? Come on, let's go!

01:18:32.683 --> 01:18:35.060
Damn, this cup is stuck!

01:18:35.603 --> 01:18:37.771
- Gonna need some time on this one.
- You got it.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:41.024
Here we go. Same play.
Pro right switch 9--

01:18:41.234 --> 01:18:42.692
Franklin! Franklin!

01:18:42.902 --> 01:18:45.820
- Franklin!
- Shane, I can't get the damn cup off!

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:47.614
- You can do this.
- Okay.

01:18:49.617 --> 01:18:51.660
It's on 1, on 1, ready?

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:01.836
Ready!

01:19:02.046 --> 01:19:03.546
Blue 89!

01:19:03.756 --> 01:19:06.007
Blue 89! Hut!

01:19:21.607 --> 01:19:23.650
<i>Franklin catches the ball!</i>

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.695
<i>Who would have thought?
He never catches the ball.</i>

01:19:26.904 --> 01:19:31.157
<i>- But he caught the ball!
- That makes the score 21 to 20.</i>

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:35.078
<i>Now, conventional wisdom says
kick the extra point, tie the game,</i>

01:19:35.288 --> 01:19:38.957
<i>and go into overtime, especially
with the playoffs on the line.</i>

01:19:39.166 --> 01:19:43.100
But Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy, Pat.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:45.714
- And McGinty says, "Go for it."
- Let's go for the win!

01:19:45.923 --> 01:19:47.799
<b>Yeah!</b>

01:19:48.467 --> 01:19:50.593
I need a receiver! l need a receiver!

01:19:51.512 --> 01:19:54.639
4-22 Y cross, okay?
We gotta have it! Gotta have it!

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:04.816
Ready? Go! Ready! Hut!

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.948
<i>And this kind of situation has not been
Falco's strong point in the past.</i>

01:20:12.158 --> 01:20:14.576
<i>Falco rolls to his left and throws.</i>

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:18.621
<i>Right into the defender's hands!</i>

01:20:18.831 --> 01:20:22.751
<i>And he drops it right into the
unsure hands of Clifford Franklin.</i>

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.210
<i>Washington wins.</i>

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.381
<i>What a lucky break for Shane Falco,
who threw a bad pass</i>

01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:31.009
that could have blown
the game for Washington.

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:49.361
Get over it, all right? It's a win.

01:20:50.237 --> 01:20:51.905
Better lucky than good?

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.200
Right.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.900
Right.

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:57.243
# Olé, olé, olé, olé #

01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:03.333
Shane Falco.

01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:06.211
- Great game out there today.
- Thanks.

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:10.548
To what do you attribute this team's
sudden rise over these past few weeks?

01:21:10.758 --> 01:21:14.552
You know, you should talk to Franklin here.
He's the hero today.

01:21:15.554 --> 01:21:17.597
Clifford Franklin, terrific day today.

01:21:17.807 --> 01:21:20.517
Yeah, yeah. Today was a good day
for Clifford Franklin.

01:21:20.726 --> 01:21:22.852
And Clifford Franklin can't wait till tomorrow.

01:21:23.062 --> 01:21:24.771
You know, Clifford Franklin gets
better looking every day.

01:21:26.774 --> 01:21:30.568
You know, we really are just beginning to scratch
the surface of the talent of Clifford Franklin.

01:21:30.778 --> 01:21:34.030
Clifford Franklin has moves
even Clifford Franklin ain't seen yet.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.534
Right. Well, you did show us a few of
those moves today against Phoenix,

01:21:37.743 --> 01:21:40.245
but it could be a different story
against Dallas next week.

01:21:40.454 --> 01:21:42.956
Oh, that's really the same story,
different chapter, girl!

01:21:43.165 --> 01:21:46.960
Yuu see, the football is like
a one-man cold to Clifford Franklin.

01:21:47.169 --> 01:21:49.000
Clifford Franklin's only one catching it.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.425
Clifford Franklin's the only one
coming down with it.

01:21:54.885 --> 01:21:57.720
# Olé, olé, olé, olé #

01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:59.973
Hey, cheers, babe.

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:02.183
I think we got it.

01:22:04.603 --> 01:22:05.937
To victory!

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.817
Feels good, doesn't it, Jimmy?
One game away from the playoffs?

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:14.988
In the hunt? That ring so close,
you can almost feel it on your finger.

01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:16.990
- What are you up to?
- What?

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:21.161
I can't get excited about the future
of my team? Huh?

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:25.165
Okay, okay, I got some great news.

01:22:25.374 --> 01:22:28.918
Martel and Carr have crossed
the picket line.

01:22:29.128 --> 01:22:32.589
With the deal I made them swallow,
I can't afford now not to take them back.

01:22:32.965 --> 01:22:34.257
No.

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:35.967
No what?

01:22:36.886 --> 01:22:38.761
I'm sticking with Falco.

01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:40.805
Jimmy, come on.

01:22:41.015 --> 01:22:42.932
You read the newspaper?

01:22:44.226 --> 01:22:47.228
The entire Dallas team
has crossed the picket line.

01:22:47.438 --> 01:22:49.939
Thanksgiving night,
we play the world champions.

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:53.693
We have a deal.
No interference with my coaching.

01:22:53.903 --> 01:22:56.863
As long as the strike is on,
Shane Falco is my quarterback.

01:22:57.156 --> 01:23:00.074
We have to beat Dallas
to get into the playoffs.

01:23:00.659 --> 01:23:03.620
Falco can't do that. You saw
what happened out there yesterday.

01:23:03.829 --> 01:23:05.663
Jesus Christ!

01:23:05.873 --> 01:23:09.167
What? Do you think he's gonna have
that luck against Dallas, too?

01:23:09.376 --> 01:23:12.000
- They'll murder him.
- He's just getting his game back!

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.500
He falls apart whenever
the game is on the line.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.050
That's been his rap
ever since the Sugar Bowl.

01:23:19.136 --> 01:23:22.263
Remember, there are 21 other guys
who put their faith in you to lead them.

01:23:22.473 --> 01:23:27.101
And they'd be heartbroken, if you abandoned
them before the biggest game of their lives.

01:23:29.687 --> 01:23:32.690
You really are a son of a bitch,
you know that?

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:42.617
What are you doing here?

01:23:42.826 --> 01:23:44.400
I don't want to make the same mistake
I did in Phoenix.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.500
Look, kid...

01:23:45.579 --> 01:23:47.956
We might end up in that situation with Dallas.

01:23:49.041 --> 01:23:51.125
They like to send their safeties.

01:23:52.753 --> 01:23:53.962
Put the pressure on.

01:23:54.171 --> 01:23:56.422
- Shane...
- Yeah, coach?

01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:58.925
It's over.

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:01.010
Martel crossed.

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:04.264
Oh.

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:06.266
I'm sorry.

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:24.576
"Chokes with the game on the line."
Is that what O'Neil said?

01:24:32.585 --> 01:24:33.960
It's okay.

01:24:34.753 --> 01:24:36.379
It's better for the team, right?

01:24:36.964 --> 01:24:38.756
I mean, Martel...

01:24:39.466 --> 01:24:42.510
He is the best. The guy's got it all.

01:24:42.761 --> 01:24:44.178
No.

01:24:45.264 --> 01:24:46.889
He doesn't have heart.

01:24:49.143 --> 01:24:50.435
You do.

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:56.983
It's been a privilege.

01:24:59.486 --> 01:25:00.653
Thanks for believing.

01:25:13.751 --> 01:25:15.460
You give them hell on Thursday, huh?

01:25:37.441 --> 01:25:40.234
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:42.529 --> 01:25:45.573
I just wanted to tell you before you left...

01:25:47.034 --> 01:25:48.117
... that I'm sorry.

01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:50.870
- Thanks.
- No, really.

01:25:51.705 --> 01:25:54.248
I think it's terrible what they do to you guys.

01:25:57.169 --> 01:26:00.900
They make you believe that
you're better than you really are,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.132
and then they just pull the rug
right out from under you.

01:26:05.928 --> 01:26:09.514
The cruelest thing they can
give guys like you, Shane...

01:26:10.182 --> 01:26:11.224
...is hope.

01:26:17.022 --> 01:26:19.607
You're a real class act, Martel.

01:26:21.068 --> 01:26:23.111
A real class act.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.572
She deserves better.

01:26:28.033 --> 01:26:31.661
You're a sinking ship, Shane.
Don't drag her down with you.

01:26:34.164 --> 01:26:36.290
Take care of my guys, huh?

01:26:40.045 --> 01:26:42.505
- Come on, boys, let's go!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:26:42.715 --> 01:26:45.591
- Nothing but water left in here. Let's go, let's go.
- It's early.

01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:47.427
I have a date.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:51.097
- But I love you, Annabelle.
- I know you do, Alan, I know.

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:53.474
Bye, you guys! Be careful!

01:27:12.911 --> 01:27:16.914
# Olé, olé, olé, olé #

01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:43.524
# Olé, olé, olé, olé #

01:27:43.734 --> 01:27:45.276
Right, have a look at this.

01:27:48.781 --> 01:27:50.531
Here he is!

01:27:50.783 --> 01:27:52.742
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:27:52.951 --> 01:27:55.745
number 16 in your programs,

01:27:55.954 --> 01:27:58.623
number one in your hearts,

01:27:59.041 --> 01:28:01.918
Shane Falco!

01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:12.400
<b>Falco!</b>

01:28:12.513 --> 01:28:13.805
Cheers, mate. God bless you.

01:28:14.014 --> 01:28:15.306
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:25.483
Are you all right?

01:28:28.737 --> 01:28:31.155
- I'm done, Nigel.
- What?

01:28:32.032 --> 01:28:35.284
- Martel crossed.
- Bloody hell.

01:28:37.037 --> 01:28:39.038
When are you gonna tell the guys?

01:28:39.248 --> 01:28:41.499
- I don't know. I don't want to ruin--
- No, no, wait.

01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:43.709
- Nigel. Nigel.
- Cut that music! Cut it!

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:45.878
Turn the music off! Cut it! Cut it!

01:28:46.213 --> 01:28:48.339
Shane's got something to tell you.

01:28:50.926 --> 01:28:52.677
I've got good news.

01:28:53.512 --> 01:28:56.514
This Thursday, you're going to be playing
with the best quarterback in the league.

01:28:56.723 --> 01:28:58.182
Damn right!

01:29:01.228 --> 01:29:02.645
Martel.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.647
He crossed.

01:29:08.777 --> 01:29:10.403
Martel crossed.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.800
So...

01:29:14.825 --> 01:29:17.827
While you guys are getting
pounded by Dallas...

01:29:19.204 --> 01:29:20.329
Just kidding.

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:24.458
...I'm going to be drinking beer on my boat.

01:29:24.668 --> 01:29:26.210
Kicking back.

01:29:29.089 --> 01:29:30.590
Sentinels...

01:29:31.216 --> 01:29:33.092
Raise your glasses.

01:29:33.886 --> 01:29:35.553
This is to Shane Falco.

01:29:36.722 --> 01:29:40.892
He's our quarterback, he's our leader,

01:29:41.101 --> 01:29:44.395
but most of all, he's our friend.
This is for you, man.

01:29:44.813 --> 01:29:47.398
- To Falco!
- <b>To Falco!</b>

01:29:49.735 --> 01:29:52.945

01:29:54.448 --> 01:29:55.990

01:31:26.999 --> 01:31:30.000
John, it appears that the strike
is coming to a close.

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:33.629
<i>Eddie Martel will be resuming
the starting quarterback position tonight.</i>

01:31:33.839 --> 01:31:36.100
<i>Yeah, but I gotta admit,
I was really looking forward to seeing</i>

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.260
<i>what Falco could do with one more game.</i>

01:31:39.469 --> 01:31:42.346
<i>Because he made amazing
progress the past few weeks</i>

01:31:42.556 --> 01:31:44.557
<i>under the tutelage of head coach,
Jimmy McGinty.</i>

01:31:44.766 --> 01:31:50.062
<i>He really did, but tonight it'll be Martel

01:31:59.448 --> 01:32:01.866
<i>You know, Pat, I never thought I'd say this, but...</i>

01:32:02.075 --> 01:32:04.618

Come on, Martel. Get moving, get moving!

01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:49.622
Maybe you should try scrambling.

01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:52.650
That's brilliant. How about a quick kick?

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:56.000

If it ain't too much trouble, I would love
to get your autograph after the game.

01:33:21.029 --> 01:33:23.030

Hey, I'm talking to you!

I call the plays out on the field, not you.

01:36:51.614 --> 01:36:53.991
- That's not the way I coach.
- I don't give a shit,

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.744

need to get back into this ball game?</i>

- Heart.
- I'm sorry?

01:37:10.675 --> 01:37:11.925
You gotta have heart.

01:37:12.135 --> 01:37:13.719
<i>Can you elaborate on that?</i>

01:37:16.556 --> 01:37:17.890
Miles and miles of heart.

01:37:19.601 --> 01:37:22.978
<i>Well, there you have it
in a word from coach McGinty.</i>

01:37:23.188 --> 01:37:26.523
Washington will need heart
to get back into this--

01:37:30.528 --> 01:37:33.113
I ran it just like you said!
You just under-threw me!

01:37:33.323 --> 01:37:36.283
This isn't a track meet, asshole.
You have to look for the ball!

01:37:36.493 --> 01:37:39.828
Hey, hey, hey! I'll pull you off the field,
you spoiled little punk.

01:37:41.247 --> 01:37:43.000
And who do you think
O'neil's going to side with, huh?

01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.876
Some burnt-out old coach or
someone who puts fans in the stands?

01:37:46.127 --> 01:37:47.920
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, come on!

01:37:48.463 --> 01:37:51.590
What the hell are you thinking about?
We got a game to play.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.593
- Nobody could beat Dallas with these losers.
- I can.

01:37:58.098 --> 01:38:01.558
Hey, Falco, it's great to see you.
Now get the hell out of my locker room!

01:38:01.768 --> 01:38:03.727
- Coach?
- What the hell took you so long?

01:38:04.604 --> 01:38:05.896
Traffic.

01:38:06.106 --> 01:38:08.148
- Suit up!
- What?

01:38:08.358 --> 01:38:09.691
What?!

01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:12.611
- O'neil will fire your ass!
- It won't be the first time!

01:38:12.821 --> 01:38:15.072
This is bullshit!
I'm gonna put an end to this right now.

01:38:15.281 --> 01:38:16.865
Come and get some!

01:38:20.954 --> 01:38:22.788
You big fairy.

01:38:30.755 --> 01:38:32.131
This doesn't change anything, Falco.

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.842
I'm an All-Pro quarterback.
I got 2 Super Bowl rings.

01:38:35.051 --> 01:38:37.700
And you'll never be more
than a replacement player.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800
Yeah.

01:38:40.265 --> 01:38:42.015
Yeah, I can live with that.

01:38:42.642 --> 01:38:43.976
All right.

01:38:44.185 --> 01:38:47.646
My brothers, will somebody please,
please get this asshole out of here?

01:38:49.399 --> 01:38:51.358
- See ya!
- Take your hands off me, you gorilla!

01:38:51.568 --> 01:38:53.026
Hey, hey!

01:39:01.619 --> 01:39:05.247
Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy, Pat.

01:39:05.665 --> 01:39:08.600
<i>And Mcginty says,
with the playoffs on the line,</i>

01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.300
<i>"Go for it. Get to the playoffs."</i>

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.299
<i>Something that Washington has not been
able to do against Dallas in over 7 years.</i>

01:39:29.814 --> 01:39:31.023
Falco?

01:39:32.734 --> 01:39:34.693
What in the hell is he up to?

01:39:35.153 --> 01:39:37.654
<i>Look, Pat, here comes Falco!</i>
Falco's back!

01:39:37.989 --> 01:39:39.323
<i>What happened to Martel?</i>

01:39:39.532 --> 01:39:41.533
<i>I don't know, but the way
Falco's running there,</i>

01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:45.537
<i>and that look he has in his eye,
he thinks he's gonna play.</i>

01:39:50.043 --> 01:39:51.084
I'm sorry.

01:39:53.004 --> 01:39:55.000
They're playing zone out there,
and I think you can pick them apart,

01:39:55.050 --> 01:39:57.591
If you just keep your eyes open
for your secondary--

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.344
<i>Hey, he seems to be necking
with that cheerleader!</i>

01:40:01.346 --> 01:40:02.804
<i>That's what he's doing!</i>

01:40:03.014 --> 01:40:06.517
<i>Players are not supposed to be fraternizing
with the cheerleaders, you know that.</i>

01:40:06.726 --> 01:40:09.478
Yeah, but what are they gonna do, Pat?
Fire him?

01:40:10.021 --> 01:40:12.439
- You give me strength.
- You're late for work.

01:40:14.817 --> 01:40:16.068
Kick ass, Falco!

01:40:19.155 --> 01:40:22.407
What's all the celebrating about here?
We're down 17 to nothing.

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.159
Falco, it's nasty out there.

01:40:24.369 --> 01:40:26.745
- That's why girls don't play the game, coach.
- There you go.

01:40:26.955 --> 01:40:31.208
Listen up. This time tomorrow,
the strike will be officially over.

01:40:31.918 --> 01:40:34.000
Now, Dallas has made a big
mistake out there tonight.

01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:35.800
They haven't been afraid of you,
and they should be,

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:38.590
because you have a powerful
weapon working for you.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.884
There is no tomorrow for you.

01:40:41.094 --> 01:40:43.637
And that makes you all
very dangerous people!

01:40:50.979 --> 01:40:52.354
Kick ass on 1. Ready!

01:40:58.736 --> 01:41:00.404
Ready!

01:41:00.905 --> 01:41:03.991
Clifford Franklin is looking for a new home.

01:41:04.909 --> 01:41:06.535
Are you ready for some pain, Footsteps?

01:41:06.744 --> 01:41:08.912
- Bring it on.
- Oh, yeah. It's coming.

01:41:09.247 --> 01:41:10.706
It's coming.

01:41:10.915 --> 01:41:12.708
That's going to be illegal.
You see him coming in motion?

01:41:16.754 --> 01:41:18.547
<i>I've never seen anything like this!</i>

01:41:18.756 --> 01:41:19.965
<i>That's unbelievable.</i>

01:41:21.259 --> 01:41:24.928
<i>There's at least 5, 6 flags out there,
there's hats, everything.</i>

01:41:25.138 --> 01:41:27.556
This is what you'd call
an old-fashioned melee.

01:41:27.807 --> 01:41:30.934
<i>Unnecessary roughness,
number 16 and number 34,</i>

01:41:31.144 --> 01:41:33.895
<i>15 yards. So, that's... wait.</i>

01:41:34.105 --> 01:41:36.356
<i>45... 30...</i>

01:41:38.568 --> 01:41:41.069
<i>How many yards so far?</i>

01:41:41.279 --> 01:41:43.614
Who do they think they're playing here?

01:41:50.121 --> 01:41:51.788
Come on, let's go! Come on!

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:20.484
Oh, my knee! Oh! It's my knee!

01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:26.281
It's my knee, man. I think I broke it.

01:42:27.659 --> 01:42:29.409
Oh, god!

01:42:30.828 --> 01:42:32.204
Did I do it? Did I score?

01:42:32.413 --> 01:42:34.998
- Yeah, you did it.
- Oh, this hurts! Oh, this hurts!

01:42:35.208 --> 01:42:36.291
I'm sorry.

01:42:36.501 --> 01:42:39.711
Oh, don't be sorry, man. Going out
in front of 80,000 people ain't bad, huh?

01:42:41.214 --> 01:42:43.900
- You finish what you started, Shane.
- Yeah.

01:42:49.347 --> 01:42:51.473
White 24! Hut!

01:42:58.856 --> 01:43:00.148
Yeah!

01:43:00.608 --> 01:43:02.401
All day, baby, all day!

01:43:07.407 --> 01:43:09.491
Blue 15! Hut, hut!

01:43:38.062 --> 01:43:40.397
<i>First down, Washington.</i>

01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:45.000
- Good job.
- I got skills, baby.

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:48.363
- Hey, Danny, feel like running the ball?
- You better give it to Wilkinson.

01:43:49.073 --> 01:43:50.949
He's going to jail.

01:43:51.159 --> 01:43:54.161
- I'll clear the way.
- I'm right behind you.

01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:56.079
- All right.
- We need it! We need it!

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.300
Sweet!

01:44:09.093 --> 01:44:13.889
<i>A gain of 20 yards by Ray Smith.
First down.</i>

01:44:19.937 --> 01:44:22.481
I know you're tired, I know you're hurting,

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.567
and I wish I could say something
that was classy and inspirational.

01:44:25.777 --> 01:44:27.319
But that just wouldn't be our style.

01:44:29.947 --> 01:44:31.281
Pain heals.

01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:33.450
Chicks dig scars.

01:44:33.659 --> 01:44:36.244
Glory lasts forever.

01:44:36.454 --> 01:44:37.621
Right on, Shane.

01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:40.332
Right on, baby. Right on!

01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:42.501
Shotgun, D.C. right,

01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:45.796
flip 90 dig, on the center,
on the center, ready?

01:44:53.679 --> 01:44:55.347
Ready! Hut!

01:45:01.813 --> 01:45:05.273
<i>I'm telling you, John, we're looking at
a different team here in the second half.</i>

01:45:05.483 --> 01:45:09.569
<i>Absolutely, Pat. Washington is playing
like there's no tomorrow,</i>

01:45:09.779 --> 01:45:11.404
because, hey, there isn't.

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:16.500
- Touchdown, baby!
- Son of a bitch!

01:45:17.495 --> 01:45:19.746
Odd bullets, blitz coverage.

01:45:20.289 --> 01:45:22.600
- Pick him up.
- I got him, I got him.

01:45:28.506 --> 01:45:29.673
That's it! Go in and hit him!

01:45:29.882 --> 01:45:32.850
<i>And Daniel Bateman comes up
with a big stop on third and one,</i>

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.511
and that forces a Dallas punt.

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.808
<i>You know, Pat, with 28 seconds remaining now,
Washington needs a decent return here,</i>

01:45:40.017 --> 01:45:43.436
<i>in order to give Gruff a shot to tie the game.</i>

01:46:06.419 --> 01:46:08.545
<i>And with 12 seconds remaining...</i>

01:46:08.754 --> 01:46:11.047
- It's yours, Nigel. All the way.
- <i>...the sentinels will try a 32-yard field goal...</i>

01:46:11.257 --> 01:46:13.174
<i>...to send this game into overtime.</i>

01:46:13.384 --> 01:46:16.052
32 yards is just a chip shot for Gruff.

01:46:23.686 --> 01:46:26.855
# Olé, olé, olé, olé #

01:46:30.359 --> 01:46:31.484
Nigel.

01:46:32.236 --> 01:46:33.737
Nigel, are you all right?

01:46:34.947 --> 01:46:36.031
I'm sorry.

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.200
I had the money, but I pissed it
all away down at the track again.

01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:41.786
What? What are you talking about?

01:46:41.996 --> 01:46:45.665
They're gonna take my pub away from me.
It's all I got, Shane.

01:46:46.375 --> 01:46:48.001
Come on, Shane!

01:46:52.381 --> 01:46:54.966
# Olé, olé, olé, olé #

01:47:00.932 --> 01:47:04.809
<i>Hey, it's a fake. Falco still has it.
Look at this Pat. He's running with it!</i>

01:47:13.361 --> 01:47:15.362
<i>Touchdown, Falco!</i>

01:47:15.450 --> 01:47:16.988
<i>From Shane Falco.</i>

01:47:28.793 --> 01:47:31.920
<i>Holding, number 68 on the offense.</i>

01:47:32.129 --> 01:47:34.798
- <i>10-yard penalty. Repeat first down.</i>
- Come on!

01:47:35.007 --> 01:47:36.549
- Terrible call! Open your eyes!
- Time out, time out!

01:47:36.759 --> 01:47:39.260
- <i>Time out, Washington.</i>
- No touchdown.

01:47:41.806 --> 01:47:44.516
- You okay?
- I broke my arm.

01:47:44.725 --> 01:47:46.768
Cheers, Shane, you saved my ass.

01:47:47.311 --> 01:47:48.436
Take care.

01:47:48.646 --> 01:47:51.564
Someday you'll have to explain to me
what the hell that was all about.

01:47:53.192 --> 01:47:54.985
What's it gonna be, Shane?

01:47:55.194 --> 01:47:56.903
I want the ball.

01:47:57.822 --> 01:47:59.197
Winners always do.

01:48:00.157 --> 01:48:01.783
- Spread formation.
- All right, let's go!

01:48:01.993 --> 01:48:03.618
Let's go! Let's go!

01:48:09.542 --> 01:48:10.834
Damn!

01:48:17.758 --> 01:48:20.176
Sorry, Shane. Sorry, everybody.

01:48:20.386 --> 01:48:23.221
No problem, Jumbo. Just make sure
you rip someone's head off on this one.

01:48:23.431 --> 01:48:24.514
Consider it done.

01:48:24.724 --> 01:48:28.727
All right. So, besides me,
who really wants the ball?

01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:31.813
Yeah. You want it, Brian.

01:48:32.023 --> 01:48:35.775
Let's hook up. D.C. left,
Y motion, 88 warrior.

01:48:35.985 --> 01:48:37.193
Gentlemen...

01:48:41.407 --> 01:48:45.577
It's been an honor to share the field
of battle with you. It's on 1, on 1. Ready!

01:49:12.063 --> 01:49:13.521
We ain't losing this game.

01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:35.800
Green 86!

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:42.750
Green 86!

01:49:50.893 --> 01:49:52.185
Hut!

01:50:17.628 --> 01:50:21.756
-Yeah!
