00:43.302 --> 00:44.636
Creed doesn't know
where he is.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.304
It's blind instinct.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.099
But now it is
Creed coming back.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.517
Creed with the left hand!

00:51.602 --> 00:53.311
What's keeping
these two guys up?

00:53.395 --> 00:55.188
A tremendous closing moment.

00:58.859 --> 01:02.362
Here comes Balboa back. But the
champion back with another left.

01:07.076 --> 01:08.826
How they're getting up,
I don't know!

01:08.911 --> 01:10.662
A right hand!
A right hand!

01:10.746 --> 01:12.497
It's Creed!
Now it's Balboa!

01:12.581 --> 01:13.665
Now it's Creed!

01:13.749 --> 01:15.625
And now a tremendous
left by Rocky.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.086
They're standing dead in the
center of the ring, toe-to-toe.

01:36.356 --> 01:37.481
One.

01:40.610 --> 01:41.652
Two.

01:41.736 --> 01:43.654
Creed
will retain the title.

01:43.738 --> 01:47.866
If neither gets up, it's a draw,
and Creed will win the title.

01:47.951 --> 01:49.076
Four.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.703
Get up, my man.

01:50.787 --> 01:51.870
Five.

01:52.163 --> 01:53.330
Get up.

01:53.415 --> 01:54.498
Six.

01:54.791 --> 01:57.209
Each fighter is trying
to beat the count.

01:57.293 --> 01:58.752
Get up, Rocky!

01:59.295 --> 02:00.462
Eight.

02:02.132 --> 02:03.215
Nine.

02:03.299 --> 02:04.800
The champ is down!

02:04.884 --> 02:05.968
Ten!

02:06.970 --> 02:08.345
You're out!

02:11.141 --> 02:13.225
Balboa got to his
feet and he made it!

02:13.309 --> 02:15.561
Rocky Balboa has
shocked the world!

02:15.645 --> 02:17.980
He is the new heavyweight
champion of the world!

02:19.941 --> 02:22.192
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:22.277 --> 02:27.197
in a stunning upset,
scoring a win by a knockout,

02:27.282 --> 02:30.868
the new heavyweight
champion of the world,

02:32.120 --> 02:35.706
Rocky Balboa!

02:36.916 --> 02:39.084
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

02:40.044 --> 02:44.507
I just want to say one
thing to my wife, who's home.

02:46.927 --> 02:49.596
Yo, Adrian, I did it!

02:49.680 --> 02:52.891
I love you.
I love you.

02:54.935 --> 03:01.191
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

03:27.051 --> 03:28.802
Hit him one, Rocky!

03:53.244 --> 03:56.579
Risin' up,
back on the street

03:57.706 --> 04:00.835
Did my time,
took my chances

04:02.045 --> 04:05.339
Went the distance,
now I'm back on my feet

04:05.423 --> 04:09.134
Just a man and
his will to survive

04:10.428 --> 04:14.139
So many times,
it happens too fast

04:14.933 --> 04:17.560
You change your
passion for glory

04:19.271 --> 04:22.940
Don't lose your grip
on the dreams of the past

04:23.024 --> 04:26.819
You must fight
just to keep them alive

04:27.237 --> 04:31.532
It's the eye of the tiger,
it's the thrill of the fight

04:31.616 --> 04:35.744
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival

04:36.037 --> 04:40.207
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

04:40.458 --> 04:47.214
And he's watchin' us all
in the eye of the tiger

04:50.677 --> 04:54.054
Face to face,
out in the heat

04:55.098 --> 04:57.975
Hangin' tough,
stayin' hungry

04:59.227 --> 05:02.730
They stack the odds
till we take to the street

05:02.814 --> 05:06.525
For we kill with
the skill to survive

05:06.902 --> 05:11.238
It's the eye of the tiger,
it's the cream of the fight

05:11.323 --> 05:15.492
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival

05:15.785 --> 05:20.123
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

05:20.207 --> 05:24.711
And he's watchin'
us all in the eye

05:24.795 --> 05:27.923
Of the tiger

05:35.973 --> 05:39.100
Risin' up,
straight to the top

05:39.185 --> 05:41.937
Have the guts,
got the glory

05:43.940 --> 05:46.775
Went the distance,
now I'm not gonna stop

05:46.859 --> 05:50.987
Just a man and
his will to survive

05:51.197 --> 05:55.367
It's the eye of the tiger,
it's the cream of the fight

05:55.451 --> 05:59.746
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival

05:59.830 --> 06:04.125
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

06:04.210 --> 06:09.839
And he's watchin'
us all in the eye

06:11.050 --> 06:14.302
Of the tiger

06:23.854 --> 06:25.981
The eye of the tiger

06:32.363 --> 06:35.323
The eye of the tiger.

06:36.450 --> 06:39.662
I want Balboa!
I want Balboa!

06:39.746 --> 06:42.456
Hear that, old man? You tell
Balboa I'm coming for him!

06:42.541 --> 06:44.875
Nobody can beat me!
You tell him what I said!

06:44.960 --> 06:46.836
And he's next!
I'm gonna kill him!

06:46.920 --> 06:49.547
Nobody can stop me!
You tell Balboa that!

06:49.631 --> 06:51.716
I'm coming after him!
You tell him!

06:51.800 --> 06:52.967
I want a shot
at the title.

06:53.051 --> 06:55.302
If Balboa's got the guts
to meet me in the ring,

06:55.387 --> 06:56.429
or anywhere else.

06:56.513 --> 06:59.598
My whole life's been directed towards
this here title and nothing else.

06:59.683 --> 07:01.559
I live alone
and I train alone.

07:01.643 --> 07:03.811
I'll win the title
alone. I want him.

07:03.895 --> 07:05.521
He can't duck me forever.

07:05.605 --> 07:07.481
He can run,
but he can't hide.

07:07.566 --> 07:10.860
Well, another southpaw,
heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa,

07:10.944 --> 07:13.070
doesn't seem to be worried
about much these days.

07:13.155 --> 07:15.364
He's just defended his
title for the 10th time,

07:15.449 --> 07:16.991
and now he's even
agreed to take on

07:17.075 --> 07:18.868
the world heavyweight
wrestling champion

07:18.952 --> 07:21.412
in a sort of charity
benefit, with all the proceeds

07:21.496 --> 07:23.205
to go to a local
youth foundation.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.166
Now, I'll have to
give him credit.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.209
Mr. Balboa manages
to stay busy.

07:27.294 --> 07:28.544
He's a true sportsman.

07:28.628 --> 07:31.130
And it looks like the number
one contender, Clubber Lang,

07:31.214 --> 07:33.215
will have to continue to
play the waiting game.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.843
But that should be
a great, great matchup.

07:35.927 --> 07:38.304
Hey, Paulie,
take it easy, okay?

07:38.680 --> 07:41.348
Awesome.
Introducing the newest...

07:41.433 --> 07:43.392
Hey, you going?

07:43.477 --> 07:46.687
Hey, hey. Don't forget to
give Rocky my best, huh?

07:47.147 --> 07:49.774
You know, I've been
coming here years.

07:50.317 --> 07:54.361
How about you giving me,
Paulie, your best once?

07:55.155 --> 07:56.906
Take it easy, Paul.

07:58.034 --> 07:59.576
Hey, hey, Paulie.

07:59.660 --> 08:01.453
Hey, Paulie,
you heard me?

08:01.537 --> 08:05.373
Hey, when you see the Rock, tell
him the boys all said, "Hey!"

08:46.374 --> 08:47.916
40 thousand.

08:52.463 --> 08:54.214
Nice try.
Nice try.

08:55.341 --> 08:57.008
I got another one.

09:52.608 --> 09:53.774
Paulie.

09:58.739 --> 10:00.323
You want to hear
I owe you?

10:00.407 --> 10:01.699
You, I owe nothing.

10:01.783 --> 10:04.076
No, you don't
owe me nothing.

10:04.161 --> 10:06.287
So what do you
want I should do?

10:06.371 --> 10:07.622
My sister ain't here?

10:07.706 --> 10:08.831
She's home.

10:08.916 --> 10:12.627
You know, me and her used to
be tight until you come in.

10:12.711 --> 10:15.254
I raise her,
she don't come down.

10:15.339 --> 10:17.673
She don't know
about this.

10:17.758 --> 10:19.675
You and her can go to
hell, you know that?

10:19.760 --> 10:22.220
Hey, watch your
mouth, Paulie.

10:22.304 --> 10:24.555
You gonna whack me?
I don't sweat you.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.224
I don't sweat you.
Come on.

10:26.308 --> 10:28.476
Oh, come on, Paul, why don't
you screw your head on right.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.186
No, it ain't my head.

10:30.270 --> 10:32.521
Your freaking head is
the one on wrong.

10:32.606 --> 10:35.067
Yeah? Well,
what did I do?

10:35.151 --> 10:36.860
What'd you do?
Nothing.

10:36.945 --> 10:38.570
For yourself,
oh, nice.

10:38.655 --> 10:40.739
Look, you fixed
your face up handsome.

10:40.823 --> 10:41.907
Nice clothes.

10:41.991 --> 10:43.825
What did you do for
Paulie? Anything?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.911
Three years, did you get me a job?

10:45.995 --> 10:50.499
Look at this. You gave me a
lousy, stinking Ex-Lax watch. This!

10:51.376 --> 10:52.417
Hey, Paulie.

10:52.502 --> 10:53.543
What?

10:53.628 --> 10:55.504
What? There,
that's right.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.256
No, leave it down!

10:57.340 --> 10:59.633
It never kept
good time anyway.

11:00.843 --> 11:02.094
You know, you forget
when you were a punk

11:02.178 --> 11:04.763
and those guys used to laugh
at you because you were so jive.

11:04.847 --> 11:06.765
Who used to whack
them bums out?

11:06.849 --> 11:08.642
They laughed
at both of us.

11:08.726 --> 11:10.352
No one laughed at me.

11:11.354 --> 11:13.355
Tell me. Who fixed you
up with your first woman?

11:13.439 --> 11:15.357
Me, Paulie!
I was responsible!

11:15.441 --> 11:17.276
She was pregnant.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.362
So what? You was
no prize either.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.448
You know, I always
give you. I give you.

11:23.533 --> 11:27.411
What do you do? You buy a new
house, you move Mick in, right?

11:27.495 --> 11:30.914
Did you ask me? Is there
something the matter with me?

11:32.083 --> 11:33.709
I got feelings, you know?
This ain't cardboard.

11:35.044 --> 11:37.212
Everybody's got
them, Paulie.

11:37.588 --> 11:39.214
The hell with everybody.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.216
No, maybe it's
the hell with you.

11:42.051 --> 11:43.719
I don't wanna listen
to this crap.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.554
Come on, you talk like
everybody owes you a living.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.638
Shut your mouth!

11:46.723 --> 11:49.891
Look, nobody owes nobody
nothing. You owe yourself.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.351
You're wrong!
Friends owe!

11:51.436 --> 11:52.978
Friends don't owe.

11:53.062 --> 11:54.856
They do because
they want to do.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.567
Shut your freaking mouth.
You been keeping me down!

11:57.651 --> 11:58.735
Down?

11:59.903 --> 12:03.114
You know, you're like a crazy
brother to me. You really are.

12:03.198 --> 12:04.866
So I want to tell you
something. This is coming

12:04.950 --> 12:06.159
straight from
the heart, Paulie.

12:06.243 --> 12:07.827
And I mean this.

12:07.911 --> 12:11.080
You ain't down,
and you ain't a loser.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.501
You're just
a jealous, lazy bum.

12:16.670 --> 12:19.172
Okay, I'm gonna
break your mouth.

12:19.590 --> 12:21.799
I'm gonna bust
your mouth up!

12:32.978 --> 12:34.604
Can I have a job?

12:37.941 --> 12:39.984
All you had
to do was ask.

12:45.407 --> 12:47.200
You punch pretty good.

12:47.284 --> 12:49.160
Think so?
Superb.

12:51.955 --> 12:53.289
It cost a lot, huh?

12:53.374 --> 12:54.665
Yeah, a few bucks.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.751
Got an extra one?

13:00.005 --> 13:01.631
Any trouble
with Paulie tonight?

13:01.715 --> 13:03.466
Nah,
nothing unusual.

13:04.134 --> 13:06.636
Are you really gonna fight
that wrestler? They're so big.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.013
That's all right,
it'll be fun.

13:09.807 --> 13:12.308
You mind if I serenade you a while?

13:14.145 --> 13:16.063
Come on, it's your part.
What are you doing?

13:16.147 --> 13:17.272
Come on.
You can do it.

13:17.357 --> 13:18.440
No.

13:19.818 --> 13:21.318
Come on, Rocky, you're
gonna wake the baby.

13:21.403 --> 13:23.779
Adrian, come on,
let's do a duet.

13:27.492 --> 13:30.494
No, no. That's good,
but it's not "doe, doe. "

13:30.578 --> 13:33.330
It's "doo, doo,
doo, doo. "

13:35.792 --> 13:37.000
That's good, darling.

13:37.085 --> 13:39.336
I've been told

13:42.132 --> 13:45.134
By people and they all

13:47.011 --> 13:48.887
Say they'd take me back

13:48.972 --> 13:51.515
Take me back like before

13:55.311 --> 13:56.770
What's the matter?

13:56.855 --> 13:59.022
I don't know any more
of that composition.

13:59.107 --> 14:00.441
Hmm.

14:00.525 --> 14:01.608
Maybe we're lucky.

14:01.693 --> 14:03.235
Yeah. Maybe
we're very lucky.

14:03.319 --> 14:04.695
Very lucky.
Hmm.

14:12.203 --> 14:13.704
Well, howdy,
howdy, howdy, sports fans.

14:13.788 --> 14:16.790
This is Dennis James with Jim
Healy down here at ringside.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.126
Tonight we have a most
unlikely match for you.

14:19.210 --> 14:21.170
The boxer against
the wrestler,

14:21.254 --> 14:23.589
with all the proceeds
going to charity.

14:23.673 --> 14:25.007
What's your feelings
about a boxer

14:25.091 --> 14:26.341
against a wrestler
in the same ring?

14:26.426 --> 14:29.636
Well, you know what the age-old
theory is, that the wrestler,

14:29.721 --> 14:31.848
once he grabs that boxer,
that's all she wrote.

14:31.932 --> 14:34.392
What the hell goes
on inside your head?

14:34.477 --> 14:35.894
Anything normal
functions?

14:36.061 --> 14:37.479
Yeah, there's a few,
there's a few.

14:37.563 --> 14:40.148
I don't think so. Because to
fight a creature like this,

14:40.232 --> 14:42.859
you gotta have about 100
pounds of brain damage.

14:42.943 --> 14:45.778
I seen wrestlers that
was bigger than dinosaurs.

14:45.905 --> 14:48.323
You ever fight a dinosaur,
kid? No, not lately.

14:48.407 --> 14:50.783
They can cause
a variety of damage.

14:50.868 --> 14:51.993
Oh, yeah?

14:52.077 --> 14:54.829
The wrestling champion of the
world is now entering the arena.

14:54.914 --> 14:56.664
I tell you, he is quite a sight.

14:56.749 --> 14:58.666
All decked out in red.

14:58.751 --> 15:00.293
Why are they
carrying him?

15:00.377 --> 15:01.753
He's walking.

15:08.052 --> 15:10.428
I'm coming after
you, Balboa.

15:11.138 --> 15:12.347
Let's call it off.

15:12.431 --> 15:13.848
Oh, come on,
it's for charity.

15:13.933 --> 15:16.017
You're wearing your
anatomy out for charity.

15:16.101 --> 15:18.686
Nobody else does
this much for charity.

15:18.771 --> 15:20.396
Bob Hope would.

15:20.481 --> 15:21.814
That's true.

15:27.154 --> 15:29.531
Rocky, you better
call Bob Hope.

15:37.248 --> 15:39.666
To all my love
slaves out there,

15:40.584 --> 15:44.837
Thunderlips is here
in the flesh, baby!

15:44.922 --> 15:46.297
Oh, my God!

15:46.799 --> 15:51.804
The ultimate male versus
the ultimate meatball.

15:53.598 --> 15:55.391
Boy, he is a monster.

15:55.475 --> 15:58.227
How much would you take even
to get in the ring with him?

15:58.311 --> 16:00.271
Would you like to start at Fort Knox?

16:00.355 --> 16:03.691
In the white corner,
an incredible sight.

16:04.985 --> 16:07.152
Standing nearly seven feet,

16:08.363 --> 16:11.115
weighing 390 pounds.

16:12.617 --> 16:14.326
Large, ain't he?
The undisputed

16:14.411 --> 16:15.578
wrestling champion
of the world...

16:15.662 --> 16:19.081
That's the biggest
arm in the world!

16:19.165 --> 16:23.711
A man who calls himself "the
ultimate object of desire,"

16:24.796 --> 16:27.381
"the mountain
of molten lust. "

16:27.465 --> 16:31.010
The one, the only
Thunderlips!

16:34.431 --> 16:37.641
You're all trash!
You're all trash!

16:37.767 --> 16:40.978
You're all trash!
You're all trash!

16:44.274 --> 16:46.400
The slugger from
Philadelphia...

16:47.694 --> 16:50.696
You'd better shut up!

16:51.865 --> 16:53.866
I'll break him in half.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.784
How much do you
think he eats?

16:55.869 --> 16:58.120
About 202 pounds.

16:58.204 --> 17:00.914
...weighing 202 pounds,

17:00.999 --> 17:04.084
the reigning heavyweight
champion of the world,

17:04.169 --> 17:06.587
Rocky Balboa.

17:07.088 --> 17:11.009
Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

17:13.429 --> 17:15.221
Come to the center
of the ring, please.

17:15.306 --> 17:17.098
Okay, come on, Mick.

17:25.066 --> 17:27.025
All right, you guys,
you know this is for fun,

17:27.108 --> 17:29.903
so take it easy and
give them a good show.

17:31.364 --> 17:35.533
Listen, after the match, how about
we get a Polaroid together, okay?

17:36.994 --> 17:38.703
You're in trouble!

17:39.413 --> 17:41.873
He got me mad. I'm gonna
break him in half like this.

17:41.957 --> 17:43.750
Come on, Rocky, you can take him.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.252
Seems like lately, everybody
wants to beat me up.

17:46.337 --> 17:48.672
This is entertainment.
It's fun and games.

17:48.756 --> 17:51.424
Stay away, make faces,
move around the ring.

17:51.550 --> 17:53.468
Got it, kid? All right. He is the ring.

17:56.180 --> 17:58.682
I get nervous
every time he does that.

18:03.688 --> 18:07.232
Whoa. You move pretty fast
for a big guy, you know that?

18:07.316 --> 18:09.025
Listen, why don't we just
move around a little bit?

18:09.110 --> 18:10.485
You know, like,
give them a good show.

18:10.569 --> 18:12.654
First I'll chase you
and you chase me, okay?

18:12.738 --> 18:14.447
How's that? All right? I'll go easy.

18:14.532 --> 18:16.157
Here you go.
That okay?

18:16.283 --> 18:18.034
Stay away from him! Does
that hurt? You all right?

18:18.119 --> 18:19.536
Don't miss.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.830
How's that, okay?
Not bad, huh?

18:24.625 --> 18:26.042
Come on,
meatball. Come on.

18:27.211 --> 18:28.254
Hey.

18:31.216 --> 18:33.759
Think it's all fake,
meatball? All fake!

18:33.844 --> 18:36.554
Thunderlips has gone
absolutely berserk.

18:38.473 --> 18:40.307
Run for your life!

18:40.392 --> 18:41.976
Blast off, meatball.

18:49.693 --> 18:53.404
Get up, boy! Come on, meatball,
get some of this right here!

18:59.035 --> 19:01.454
Rocko, remember
the neighborhood!

19:02.622 --> 19:04.123
Get out of his way!

19:04.207 --> 19:06.667
No, no, no! Not yet,
not for the meatball.

19:06.752 --> 19:08.002
I'm not done
with him yet, boy.

19:08.086 --> 19:12.047
If I can't break your spirit, I
sure enough can break your back.

19:15.135 --> 19:16.886
Is Daddy having fun?

19:16.970 --> 19:18.345
Of course.

19:23.810 --> 19:25.936
Somebody hand me
a hatchet.

19:27.022 --> 19:28.439
Holy smoke!

19:28.857 --> 19:32.026
Here we go,
baby! Lights out, meatball!

19:36.364 --> 19:39.450
Oh, my God! Balboa
is really in pain.

19:39.534 --> 19:42.244
No one can believe the superhuman
strength of Thunderlips.

19:43.997 --> 19:45.372
I am the man.

19:45.457 --> 19:46.707
Stop him, will you?

19:46.792 --> 19:48.418
You want
this punching bag?

19:48.503 --> 19:49.544
Adrian!

19:49.629 --> 19:51.588
Rocky!
Then you got him!

19:51.672 --> 19:53.131
Catch me!

19:53.216 --> 19:58.637
That's incredible! Balboa was just
heaved clear into the fifth row!

19:58.721 --> 20:01.056
Now the fans
are outraged, too.

20:02.433 --> 20:06.144
Now you got me mad! I'm gonna drag
him down the aisle like a dirty rag!

20:06.229 --> 20:08.104
You weakling, Balboa.

20:09.398 --> 20:11.483
Take it easy.
Take it easy!

20:12.443 --> 20:14.110
What is it,
Mickey? You okay?

20:14.195 --> 20:15.153
It's my heart.

20:15.238 --> 20:17.280
The security guards are
rushing out to stop this.

20:17.365 --> 20:20.283
People are flying
everywhere! Teeth are flying!

20:20.409 --> 20:21.660
Cut my gloves off.

20:21.744 --> 20:23.745
What,
you finished?

20:23.830 --> 20:25.914
Come on, cut
my gloves off!

20:27.208 --> 20:30.669
That place is a zoo! This
place has turned into a zoo!

20:30.753 --> 20:32.045
This is very, very...

20:32.129 --> 20:34.506
Want me to get
a doctor? You sure?

20:34.590 --> 20:36.216
The girls have
gotten into it now.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.093
They're getting
beat up, too.

20:40.763 --> 20:42.889
Where are you going, you
fool? I'll be right back.

20:42.974 --> 20:45.225
You're a maniac!
Come back here!

20:45.309 --> 20:47.018
What are you doing?

20:47.103 --> 20:48.395
Come back here!

20:48.479 --> 20:50.313
Come on! You!

20:50.398 --> 20:53.191
Get out of my way,
worms! I'm coming up!

20:55.903 --> 20:57.529
Come on! Come on!

21:02.493 --> 21:04.911
All right, Thunderlips,
break it up! Break it up!

21:04.996 --> 21:07.123
No choking!
No choking!

21:09.960 --> 21:11.502
Paulie, don't!

21:14.423 --> 21:16.299
No, I don't
sweat you.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.767
Hang on there, kid!

21:28.395 --> 21:30.104
How do you
like it, huh?

21:30.188 --> 21:31.981
You're kind of cute!

21:32.399 --> 21:33.399
I don't need this.

21:33.483 --> 21:35.985
Rocky is out-and-out
strangling him.

21:36.111 --> 21:38.571
Rocky hanging on
like a bull terrier.

21:38.655 --> 21:41.657
Now he's got him
in a stranglehold.

21:41.742 --> 21:44.035
Rocky! Rocky!

21:49.917 --> 21:51.334
The body!

21:56.340 --> 21:58.174
Knock his block off!

22:06.183 --> 22:07.934
Timber!

22:10.646 --> 22:14.106
It's unbelievable!
Rocky actually did it!

22:14.191 --> 22:16.567
The human skyscraper has
been thrown out of the ring!

22:17.819 --> 22:20.738
All right, that's it,
that's it. Time is up.

22:23.700 --> 22:27.871
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a draw. A draw.

22:29.666 --> 22:32.793
Thank you all for attending
this 12th annual charity match

22:32.877 --> 22:35.420
between the Italian
Stallion, Rocky Balboa,

22:35.505 --> 22:37.965
and Thunderlips,
the Ultimate Male.

22:38.049 --> 22:40.342
See you next year.
Thank God.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.719
Are you all right?
Yeah, pretty good.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.596
Good match.

22:44.681 --> 22:46.807
Hey, why'd you get so
crazy on me out there?

22:46.891 --> 22:48.934
That's the name
of the game.

22:49.018 --> 22:50.435
Well, listen, while you're still calm,

22:50.520 --> 22:52.437
can we get that
Polaroid together?

22:52.522 --> 22:53.814
Yeah, sure.

22:53.898 --> 22:55.649
Adrian, come
on over here.

22:55.733 --> 22:57.985
My wife, Adrian.
My kid.

22:58.069 --> 22:59.945
That's Thunderlips.
Would you do that?

23:00.029 --> 23:02.572
That hurt.
Okay, that's all right.

23:02.699 --> 23:05.534
You know, sometimes
charity really hurts.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.249
And this Pinocchio,
he told a lie, you see,

23:12.375 --> 23:13.917
and his nose started
growing real big.

23:14.002 --> 23:16.545
Why didn't
his ears grow?

23:16.629 --> 23:18.922
I don't know. I didn't
write the story there.

23:19.007 --> 23:20.424
Are you fighting again?

23:20.508 --> 23:23.176
Today? No, I don't
plan on fighting today.

23:23.261 --> 23:24.261
Promise?

23:24.345 --> 23:26.304
Promise. Definitely, I promise.

23:26.389 --> 23:27.764
Good, I like
you here.

23:27.849 --> 23:29.349
Yeah? Well, I like
being here.

23:29.434 --> 23:30.600
Are you getting hungry?

23:30.727 --> 23:32.227
Huh? You want some breakfast? Yeah.

23:32.353 --> 23:33.645
What do you want, Wheaties? Yeah.

23:33.730 --> 23:35.313
What are Wheaties?
Champions!

23:35.398 --> 23:37.357
Breakfast of what?
Champions! Champions.

23:38.860 --> 23:41.987
And the father bear, he says,
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "

23:42.071 --> 23:45.742
And the little kid bear said,
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed

23:45.826 --> 23:47.201
"and there she is. "

23:47.286 --> 23:49.037
Thereby, he pulls
back the covers,

23:49.121 --> 23:53.041
and thereby exposing her to
the, you know, public, see?

23:53.125 --> 23:55.084
Come on, eat your cereal
before it sinks. Hurry up.

23:55.169 --> 23:57.545
Then what happened to Goldilocks?

23:57.629 --> 23:59.213
Happened to her?
I'm not exactly sure.

23:59.298 --> 24:01.758
Busted for trespassing and
got 30 days in the cooler.

24:01.842 --> 24:03.342
Oh, that's real
nice, Paulie.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.053
That's nice
to tell the kid.

24:05.137 --> 24:08.848
Rocky. Rocky,
the car is waiting.

24:08.932 --> 24:10.224
Go ahead. You
guys better go.

24:10.309 --> 24:11.809
Be a good boy, now.

24:11.894 --> 24:13.394
We'll have a fun time,
me and the kid.

24:13.479 --> 24:14.437
All right.

24:14.521 --> 24:17.148
Mrs. Stallion, you
almost look pretty good.

24:17.232 --> 24:19.108
Oh, thank you, Paulie.

24:19.651 --> 24:21.527
Don't give the kid
any beer, all right?

24:21.612 --> 24:25.031
Okay, we got to go. And Paulie, don't
take him to the track, all right?

24:25.115 --> 24:26.574
How you doing, Mick?

24:26.658 --> 24:27.867
Pretty good.

24:29.411 --> 24:31.829
Now, we got a problem in the seventh.

24:52.434 --> 24:55.812
Whatever happened to them
quiet, tender moments, huh?

25:13.248 --> 25:15.749
Thank you. Thank you,
one and all.

25:16.042 --> 25:20.170
Every once in a while, a person
comes along who defies the odds.

25:20.922 --> 25:26.009
Who defies logic and
fulfills an incredible dream.

25:26.970 --> 25:30.264
On behalf of all the
citizens of Philadelphia

25:30.348 --> 25:33.433
and the many who have been
touched by your accomplishments

25:33.518 --> 25:35.644
and your untiring
participation

25:35.728 --> 25:38.397
in this city's many
charity functions,

25:38.481 --> 25:42.151
it is with tremendous honor
that we present this memorial

25:42.235 --> 25:44.945
which will stand
always as a celebration

25:45.071 --> 25:47.823
to the indomitable
spirit of man.

25:48.449 --> 25:52.286
Philadelphia salutes its
favorite son, Rocky Balboa!

26:04.674 --> 26:05.966
It's beautiful.

26:06.050 --> 26:08.302
Definitely a thing
of beauty.

26:08.928 --> 26:11.513
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

26:11.598 --> 26:21.482
Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky!

26:21.609 --> 26:23.985
Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky!

26:24.069 --> 26:25.445
Thank you.

26:29.617 --> 26:31.367
Thank you very much.

26:36.123 --> 26:39.792
I don't know, what do you
say to something like this?

26:42.463 --> 26:44.339
About three years ago,

26:45.424 --> 26:50.553
this city really took
me inside, you know?

26:53.641 --> 26:57.936
And I want to thank you very
much for that. I really do.

26:59.271 --> 27:01.147
And I've been
thinking that...

27:01.232 --> 27:04.734
I wasn't gonna bring this
up, but I might as well, now.

27:05.486 --> 27:09.447
I would never do anything
to hurt this sport

27:09.531 --> 27:13.660
that has been
so really good to me.

27:14.578 --> 27:18.957
I've been talking it over
with my wife and my manager,

27:20.668 --> 27:22.418
and we think that...

27:23.295 --> 27:26.673
It's really hard to do
this. I feel like a bum.

27:27.591 --> 27:30.510
I'm thinking maybe
it's time that I should

27:31.387 --> 27:35.890
step down, maybe,
and retire.

27:35.975 --> 27:39.435
No! No! No!

27:39.520 --> 27:41.939
No, you can't
do that, Rocky.

27:42.023 --> 27:43.399
Getting out
while you can?

27:43.483 --> 27:46.110
Don't give this sucker
no statue. Give him guts.

27:46.194 --> 27:47.945
I told you
I wasn't going away.

27:48.029 --> 27:49.697
You got your shot,
now give me mine.

27:49.781 --> 27:51.448
Why don't you get
the hell out of there!

27:51.574 --> 27:53.284
Shut up, old man.
I ain't going nowhere.

27:53.368 --> 27:55.786
Why don't you tell all these nice
folks why you been ducking me?

27:55.870 --> 27:58.622
Politics, man. This country
wants to keep me down.

27:58.707 --> 27:59.832
Keep everybody weak.

27:59.916 --> 28:01.375
They don't want a man
like me to have the title,

28:01.459 --> 28:03.335
because I'm not a puppet
like that fool up there.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.462
You know, you've got
a big mouth, you know.

28:05.547 --> 28:08.549
Why don't you come down and
close it, Balboa? Come on!

28:08.633 --> 28:09.883
Anytime.

28:09.968 --> 28:11.927
That guy's crazy.
Don't listen to him.

28:12.012 --> 28:13.429
The little man don't
wanna come to me,

28:13.513 --> 28:15.431
then I'll come to you
people and lay out the truth.

28:15.515 --> 28:17.391
I am ranked
number one. One!

28:17.475 --> 28:18.684
That means
I'm the best.

28:18.768 --> 28:21.770
But this bum is taking the easy
matches, fighting other bums.

28:21.855 --> 28:23.605
I'm telling you
and everybody here

28:23.690 --> 28:26.108
I'll fight him anywhere,
anytime, for nothing.

28:26.276 --> 28:29.737
Fight him,
Rock! Fight him!

28:29.821 --> 28:31.530
But you people ain't
never gonna see that happen

28:31.614 --> 28:32.906
because he's
gonna retire.

28:32.991 --> 28:35.659
You see? He don't
fight no real man.

28:35.744 --> 28:37.286
He fights them setups.
What?

28:37.370 --> 28:39.204
You're a disgrace
to the sport.

28:39.289 --> 28:40.581
Shut up, old man!
You and that chump

28:40.665 --> 28:42.374
don't know where
I had to come from.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.293
Balboa, your family's
doing real nice, ain't it?

28:44.377 --> 28:46.545
You call yourself a
fighter? Prove it now.

28:46.629 --> 28:48.422
Give me the
same chance.

28:48.506 --> 28:50.466
The way he's been
ducking me is a disgrace.

28:50.550 --> 28:52.676
If he ain't no coward, why
don't he fight me, then?

28:52.761 --> 28:54.303
I can't listen to any more
of this. Hey, anytime...

28:54.387 --> 28:56.347
I don't care
what you're ranked.

28:56.431 --> 28:58.724
You don't get no shot,
and I mean that!

28:58.808 --> 29:00.101
I'm glad you people
are seeing this here.

29:00.186 --> 29:01.811
What are you doing?
I want to fight this guy.

29:01.896 --> 29:03.188
Well, you got him.

29:03.272 --> 29:05.148
But you'll fight
him without me.

29:06.108 --> 29:07.609
What are you saying?
It's finished.

29:07.693 --> 29:08.943
Yes, I'm finished.

29:09.028 --> 29:10.320
I don't want
no more of this.

29:10.404 --> 29:12.405
I don't want no more,
you understand?

29:12.490 --> 29:15.075
None of it!
It's over with!

29:16.952 --> 29:20.205
Hey, woman. Hey, woman! Listen here.

29:20.289 --> 29:22.123
Since your man
ain't got no heart,

29:22.208 --> 29:24.084
maybe you'd like
to see a real man.

29:24.168 --> 29:25.585
I bet you stay up
late every night

29:25.669 --> 29:27.462
dreaming you had
a real man, don't you?

29:27.546 --> 29:29.464
I'll tell you what. Bring
your pretty little self

29:29.548 --> 29:31.216
over to my
apartment tonight,

29:31.300 --> 29:32.675
and I'll show you
a real man.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.719
You want it,
you got it!

29:40.643 --> 29:41.684
You got it!

29:48.317 --> 29:51.694
Rocky, don't. Come on,
Rocky, please, let's go talk.

29:51.779 --> 29:54.030
Adrian.
Rocky, don't.

29:54.115 --> 29:56.825
Rocky! Let's talk.

30:01.539 --> 30:02.705
Why'd you leave?

30:02.790 --> 30:04.290
Why'd you walk
away like that?

30:04.375 --> 30:06.292
Life's too
short, kid.

30:07.169 --> 30:08.586
Where you going?

30:08.671 --> 30:11.339
I'm going on a
permanent vacation.

30:12.341 --> 30:14.592
What are you talking about?
We got one more fight.

30:14.677 --> 30:16.719
No, no. Not we, you.

30:18.557 --> 30:20.516
Why are you
doing this?

30:25.272 --> 30:26.730
I said, why are
you doing this?

30:26.815 --> 30:28.941
Because you can't
win, Rock!

30:29.025 --> 30:32.278
This guy will kill you to
death inside of three rounds!

30:32.362 --> 30:33.404
You're crazy.

30:33.488 --> 30:34.655
What else is new?

30:34.739 --> 30:35.906
He's just
another fighter.

30:35.991 --> 30:37.992
No, he ain't just
another fighter.

30:38.076 --> 30:41.662
This guy is a wrecking
machine, and he's hungry!

30:41.746 --> 30:44.290
Hell, you ain't been hungry
since you won that belt!

30:44.374 --> 30:46.667
What are you talking about?
I've had 10 title defenses.

30:46.751 --> 30:47.918
That was easy!

30:48.003 --> 30:49.086
What do you
mean, easy?

30:49.171 --> 30:50.963
They was hand-picked!

30:54.134 --> 30:56.802
Setups?
No, they weren't setups.

30:56.887 --> 31:00.639
They was good fighters, but they
wasn't killers like this guy.

31:00.724 --> 31:03.267
He'll knock you
into tomorrow, Rock.

31:23.079 --> 31:24.580
Jeez, Mick.

31:26.917 --> 31:28.501
Why'd you do it?

31:31.087 --> 31:33.506
Because the beating
that you got

31:33.590 --> 31:35.799
from Apollo should
have killed you, kid.

31:36.092 --> 31:37.135
It didn't.

31:37.220 --> 31:41.431
It was my job to keep you
winning and to keep you healthy.

31:47.271 --> 31:50.440
You really don't think I
got nothing left, do you?

31:51.234 --> 31:55.320
Well, Rock, let's
put it this way.

31:57.114 --> 31:59.741
Three years ago
you was supernatural.

32:00.618 --> 32:04.120
You was... You was
hard and you was nasty

32:04.205 --> 32:07.249
and you had
this cast-iron jaw.

32:08.292 --> 32:12.712
But then the worst
thing happened to you

32:12.797 --> 32:15.715
that could happen
to any fighter.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.010
You got civilized. Yeah.

32:23.558 --> 32:25.350
Don't worry, kid.

32:25.726 --> 32:30.397
You know, presidents
retire, generals retire,

32:30.481 --> 32:34.317
horses retire,
Man o' War retired.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.778
They put him
out to stud.

32:37.947 --> 32:40.657
That's what you
should've done, retire.

32:44.287 --> 32:46.871
I can't retire knowing all this, Mick.

32:47.456 --> 32:50.208
Don't push it. Well,
you been carrying me.

32:50.668 --> 32:52.002
We don't need it.

32:52.086 --> 32:53.628
You been carrying
me, though.

32:54.463 --> 32:56.257
I haven't been
carrying you.

32:56.341 --> 32:57.466
I've been
protecting you.

32:57.551 --> 33:00.886
No. Look, I want this
fight. Just one more.

33:00.971 --> 33:02.179
No, we don't need it.

33:02.264 --> 33:04.181
I'll live in the gym.

33:04.266 --> 33:05.391
We don't need it.

33:05.475 --> 33:06.892
Mick, I do.

33:08.103 --> 33:10.229
I'm asking you to
train me one last time.

33:10.314 --> 33:12.398
Oh, no, I can't.

33:12.482 --> 33:13.774
If you don't,

33:15.068 --> 33:18.279
I'm gonna tell everybody you ain't bought
a new pair of underwear in 10 years.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.116
You would,
wouldn't you?

33:22.200 --> 33:23.868
Yeah, absolutely.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.205
No, no.

33:28.290 --> 33:29.540
Come on.

33:31.376 --> 33:33.753
One more time,
it's over.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.672
It's a deal?
Come on, come on.

33:36.757 --> 33:39.258
It's your head, kid.
It's your head.

33:42.763 --> 33:45.473
Yeah, it is.
Thanks, Mick.

33:47.559 --> 33:50.519
Pushin', gettin'
ready for the fight

33:51.146 --> 33:54.398
Pushin', every
day and night

33:55.942 --> 33:59.195
Pushin', gettin' ready
for the fight

33:59.780 --> 34:02.782
Pushin', every
day and night

34:03.617 --> 34:05.951
Pushin', gettin' ready
for the fight...

34:06.036 --> 34:10.081
Rocky robes here. Get your Rocky
robes here. Hot off the truck.

34:10.165 --> 34:11.831
Rocky robes,
hot off the truck.

34:11.917 --> 34:13.708
Clean stuff.
Get your robes.

34:21.094 --> 34:23.679
On the night of the fight

34:23.763 --> 34:25.138
I will survive

34:25.223 --> 34:29.016
There's nowhere to run,
there's nowhere to hide

34:29.101 --> 34:30.851
On the night of the fight

34:30.937 --> 34:32.938
It's just you and I

34:33.022 --> 34:37.275
There's nowhere to run,
there's nowhere to hide...

34:37.360 --> 34:39.152
Right here.
Once in a lifetime!

34:39.237 --> 34:40.737
Get your buttons here!

34:40.947 --> 34:43.364
You can't stand
toe-to-toe with this guy

34:43.449 --> 34:45.992
or he'll deposit
you up there on Mars.

34:46.244 --> 34:48.995
He's too tough.
He's too strong.

34:50.331 --> 34:54.751
Listen, how the hell can we
train in this creep joint here?

34:54.877 --> 34:56.293
I mean, this is
kind of a house

34:56.379 --> 34:58.213
of ill reputes or
something, isn't it?

34:58.297 --> 35:00.215
Why did you
rent this joint?

35:00.299 --> 35:02.801
Oh, come on, Mickey. Let's
go out in style, okay?

35:02.885 --> 35:05.345
You wanna go out in style,
go out in one piece!

35:05.430 --> 35:07.013
Now, come on, let's get out of here!

35:07.098 --> 35:08.807
Let's go back to
the old gym, will you?

35:08.891 --> 35:11.351
Let's get some blood and
sweat and tears around you!

35:11.436 --> 35:12.853
Can we do that?

35:12.937 --> 35:15.897
Hey, will you just
relax and enjoy it, okay?

35:20.111 --> 35:21.778
They love it, Mick.

35:28.995 --> 35:31.496
Go on, fight!
Fight now, go ahead!

35:31.581 --> 35:34.167
Fight it, fight it.
Get rough, get tough.

35:34.251 --> 35:36.002
Get brutal.
That's it.

35:36.086 --> 35:38.045
Excuse me. Could I get a kiss?

35:38.130 --> 35:39.213
Yeah, sure.

35:39.673 --> 35:41.257
Get out of here,
will you?

35:41.341 --> 35:43.009
This is like
fighting in a zoo.

35:43.093 --> 35:44.719
This is a zoo,
you know?

35:44.803 --> 35:46.596
Is that the way you
train for Clubber?

35:46.680 --> 35:48.097
He ain't gonna
kiss you.

35:48.182 --> 35:50.141
He's gonna kill you,
you know that?

35:50.225 --> 35:51.350
Go on. Get
out of here!

35:57.191 --> 35:59.317
Rock, how about a picture? Yeah, sure.

35:59.401 --> 36:00.693
There you go.
Rock.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.664
Rocky! Rocky!

36:41.235 --> 36:43.986
Put a little
speed on there.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.239
Thattaboy.
That's it.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.960
All right, this will
tell us the story.

36:58.044 --> 37:02.464
That's it! Side to side!
Side to side, Rock!

37:03.258 --> 37:05.092
Shut up back there,
can't you?

37:05.176 --> 37:06.677
Change your tune or...

37:06.761 --> 37:09.596
That's it. Pull front
punches. That's it, kid.

37:09.681 --> 37:11.056
You're a deadly weapon.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.017
Time! Time, time,
time. Quit it.

37:14.477 --> 37:16.270
You're okay.
Come on.

37:16.980 --> 37:19.356
Here. Put this on before
you catch pneumonia.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.191
Okay. I'll give you
a little rubdown, too.

37:21.276 --> 37:23.360
Yeah.
And listen, kid.

37:23.444 --> 37:27.698
I don't like to hear much of
what comes out of people's mouths

37:27.782 --> 37:30.409
and I don't like
soft-talking moments.

37:30.493 --> 37:31.577
That's for sure.

37:31.661 --> 37:33.871
You know, but I just
wanna tell you one thing,

37:33.955 --> 37:35.539
that I'm proud
of you.

37:37.041 --> 37:38.166
Well, thanks
a lot.

37:38.251 --> 37:39.418
That's all
right, kid.

37:39.502 --> 37:41.295
Let's get out of here,
shall we? Hey, Mick.

37:41.379 --> 37:42.588
Yeah?

37:42.672 --> 37:44.381
What do you think we're gonna
do when it's all over, huh?

37:44.465 --> 37:48.051
I don't know. Maybe join up with
a circus or something. All right.

37:48.136 --> 37:50.345
Yeah, maybe. All right, let's get out.

37:57.186 --> 37:59.855
Good evening, everyone. Along
with Bill Baldwin, I'm Stu Nahan.

37:59.939 --> 38:02.357
And we welcome you to tonight's
heavyweight title fight

38:02.525 --> 38:05.027
Which may prove to be
the most memorable of all.

38:05.111 --> 38:06.737
For tonight is
the champion's final

38:06.821 --> 38:09.239
and perhaps most
difficult title defense.

38:09.324 --> 38:11.492
Rocky, do you feel you're in
the best shape of your career?

38:11.577 --> 38:13.411
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
I feel real good.

38:13.495 --> 38:16.331
He's a deadly weapon, he's one
of a kind. And he's gonna do it.

38:16.415 --> 38:18.082
Clubber, do you think
you're as fast as Balboa?

38:18.167 --> 38:19.834
I don't wanna do no talking.
I'll do my talking in the ring.

38:19.919 --> 38:21.753
Clubber,
dance for us.

38:23.589 --> 38:25.048
I told you, you better get out of here!

38:25.132 --> 38:26.507
I want to be alone!

38:26.592 --> 38:28.259
Will you
retire after this fight?

38:28.344 --> 38:29.886
Oh, yeah, this is
the last one for sure.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.512
After this, me and
Mick are finished.

38:31.639 --> 38:33.181
This is definitely
the last one.

38:33.265 --> 38:35.141
You're all parasites
and leeches.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.392
Get out of here!

38:36.477 --> 38:38.770
What will
you do after tonight?

38:39.563 --> 38:41.522
I'm not sure.

38:41.607 --> 38:43.483
Maybe join the circus,
huh, Mick?

38:43.567 --> 38:45.568
Yeah, have some fun.

38:45.653 --> 38:46.945
Come on,
take your robe off.

38:47.029 --> 38:49.656
Come on,
take off your robe!

38:49.740 --> 38:52.283
I told you to
get out of my face!

38:52.368 --> 38:53.785
With us this evening is the former

38:53.869 --> 38:55.203
heavyweight champion
of the world,

38:55.287 --> 38:56.537
Apollo Creed.

38:56.622 --> 38:58.164
Do you have any
predictions on this fight?

38:58.248 --> 39:00.208
How do you see this
fight going tonight?

39:00.292 --> 39:03.127
Well, I feel that strength would
have to go to the challenger,

39:03.212 --> 39:05.213
while experience and
the world's hardest head

39:05.297 --> 39:06.631
would have to go
to Rocky Balboa.

39:06.715 --> 39:07.924
And you know
I know about that.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.969
Now remember, Rock,
don't trade with this guy.

39:11.053 --> 39:13.012
Take your time.
Wear him down.

39:13.138 --> 39:15.139
But don't stand toe-to-toe
with him. Mmm-hmm.

39:15.224 --> 39:18.226
This punk's never been
15 rounds before.

39:18.894 --> 39:20.478
Take him good.
Okay.

39:20.562 --> 39:21.896
Take him good.
I will.

39:21.981 --> 39:23.356
That's it.

39:23.983 --> 39:25.441
So I predict that the
champ's gonna take this one.

39:25.526 --> 39:28.027
Now, wait a minute. Do you really
think the champ can hit that hard?

39:29.405 --> 39:30.739
Why do you think I'm
sitting out here with you?

39:49.217 --> 39:50.384
Hey, sucker!

39:50.468 --> 39:52.386
Balboa, you gone,
you finished!

39:52.470 --> 39:55.139
You through! You washed up!
I'm the baddest in the world!

39:55.223 --> 39:56.598
You don't look
so bad to me.

39:56.683 --> 39:58.017
What you say,
paper champion?

39:58.101 --> 39:59.184
I'm gonna beat
you like a dog.

39:59.269 --> 40:00.352
A dog, you hear me!

40:00.437 --> 40:02.354
Can't you get that
ape back into the ring?

40:02.439 --> 40:04.606
You made me wait too
long! You gonna pay!

40:04.691 --> 40:06.692
Come on, mouth!
Get out of my way.

40:06.776 --> 40:08.485
Get him out
of there, can't you?

40:08.570 --> 40:10.279
Get him out of there!

40:14.409 --> 40:15.826
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

40:15.910 --> 40:18.037
Back up.

40:18.121 --> 40:20.039
You know who I am? You know who I am?

40:20.123 --> 40:22.041
I'm the man!
I'm the man!

40:25.754 --> 40:29.131
You're dead meat! You're
dead meat! Let me go!

40:29.215 --> 40:31.550
Rocky! Rocky!

40:31.634 --> 40:33.177
Get off!

40:33.261 --> 40:34.887
What's the
matter? Mick!

40:34.971 --> 40:37.347
What's wrong, Adrian?
Get a doctor!

40:37.432 --> 40:39.808
Somebody get a doctor!
Come on!

40:41.603 --> 40:44.188
Sit here, Mick.
Get them out of here.

40:46.441 --> 40:48.275
Get them out of here!

40:49.278 --> 40:50.570
Come on, Mick, will
you sit on the table?

40:50.654 --> 40:51.988
Mick? Mick!
I'm all right.

40:52.073 --> 40:54.240
Just take a deep breath.
Get those guys out of here!

40:54.325 --> 40:56.534
Move! Mick, will
you sit on the...

40:56.619 --> 40:58.912
Paulie. Paulie, tell them
the fight's off. Go on. Go on!

40:58.996 --> 41:00.246
No! The fight's
not off.

41:00.331 --> 41:01.790
What, are you out of
your mind or something?

41:01.874 --> 41:03.374
The fight's on.
Are you crazy?

41:03.459 --> 41:04.918
Mick, we can't. Not
tonight. I ain't fighting...

41:05.002 --> 41:06.795
Yes, tonight.
We're gonna fight.

41:06.879 --> 41:08.880
Just let me get my breath.
Can't I get my breath?

41:08.964 --> 41:10.048
Is that against the rules or something?

41:10.132 --> 41:12.050
Mick... Will you
please get a doctor?

41:12.134 --> 41:14.010
Paulie, go on.
He's on his way.

41:14.095 --> 41:15.470
Mick, I can't go out
there and fight like this.

41:15.554 --> 41:16.805
I can't
go out there like this.

41:16.889 --> 41:19.599
Now, get out there.
Get going, will you?

41:19.683 --> 41:21.059
Take him.
Take him good.

41:21.143 --> 41:22.435
Get it over with,
why don't you?

41:22.520 --> 41:25.522
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

41:25.606 --> 41:28.191
Adrian, what am
I supposed to do?

41:28.275 --> 41:30.276
What the hell do you mean,
what are you supposed to do?

41:30.361 --> 41:33.404
After all these years together,
you don't know what to do?

41:33.489 --> 41:34.948
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

41:35.032 --> 41:37.033
Now get out there
and do it!

41:38.619 --> 41:39.786
Do it.

41:41.497 --> 41:42.664
Do it!

41:43.499 --> 41:45.083
You're the best.

41:45.584 --> 41:48.753
Okay. Okay.

41:48.879 --> 41:52.048
Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky!

41:52.133 --> 41:53.591
Oh, my God.

41:56.137 --> 41:59.055
Adrian, take care of him.
Take care of him.

42:04.228 --> 42:06.312
Well, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

42:06.397 --> 42:08.482
and welcome to
the feature event

42:08.567 --> 42:11.694
for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

42:11.778 --> 42:16.490
And, fans, with us tonight,
truly one of the fistic greats.

42:16.575 --> 42:20.744
He's coming up from ringside,
the Master of Disaster,

42:20.829 --> 42:25.332
the King of Sting, the
one and only Apollo Creed!

42:26.835 --> 42:28.919
And there he is,
the former heavyweight

42:29.004 --> 42:31.005
champion of the world,
Apollo Creed.

42:31.089 --> 42:33.299
Stu, he looks
like $9 million.

42:33.675 --> 42:34.758
Get out of my face.

42:34.843 --> 42:36.385
I don't need nothing you got no more.

42:36.469 --> 42:38.846
Don't need no has-been
messing in my corner.

42:38.930 --> 42:41.849
And you better get that bad look
off your face before I knock it off!

42:41.933 --> 42:44.560
Come on. Want to jump?
Jump, come on.

42:45.103 --> 42:47.313
Come on, Creed.
Come on.

42:48.982 --> 42:52.401
Yeah, come on. Yeah, just
like a chicken. You better run.

42:57.407 --> 43:00.367
Give everybody a present and
drop this chump, all right?

43:00.452 --> 43:02.578
All right.
Good luck to you.

43:07.292 --> 43:08.709
All right, fans,
here we go.

43:08.793 --> 43:11.712
Presenting to you, on my
left, out of the blue corner,

43:11.796 --> 43:17.051
hailing from Chicago, weighing
in at an even 235 pounds,

43:17.135 --> 43:20.054
the world's number
one challenger...

43:20.138 --> 43:21.388
I wonder how
Mick's doing.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.432
...the undefeated
Clubber Lang.

43:24.851 --> 43:28.313
I'm the best. I'm the
best. I'm the best.

43:28.814 --> 43:31.733
You and Clubber exchanged
words up there. Any comment?

43:31.817 --> 43:32.859
I have no comment.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.487
And his opponent in the opposite corner

43:35.571 --> 43:39.241
really needing no
introduction the world over.

43:39.325 --> 43:42.827
He weighs in at
a trim 201 pounds,

43:42.912 --> 43:47.707
the pride of Philadelphia,
the Italian Stallion,

43:47.792 --> 43:51.920
and the reigning heavyweight
champion of the world,

43:52.004 --> 43:55.590
Rocky Balboa!

43:58.761 --> 44:00.637
Listen
to this crowd.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.436
Now to give instructions
in the middle of the ring,

44:08.521 --> 44:11.147
the referee, Marty Denkin.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.193
Clubber, Rocky,
you know the rules.

44:15.861 --> 44:17.028
I want a good,
clean fight.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.697
When I tell you to break,
I want you to step back

44:18.781 --> 44:20.073
at my command
and break.

44:20.157 --> 44:23.952
Now, go back to the corner and
come out fighting at the bell.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.037
Dead meat.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.087
This is not gonna be a fight of finesse.

44:34.171 --> 44:36.381
These are two guys
that really throw punches.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.174
This thing could end with one
punch. The chump is scared.

44:38.301 --> 44:40.593
Scared. Scared. Yeah.
Tear him up, champ.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.721
See the look
in his eyes?

44:44.265 --> 44:48.185
I'm no trainer. Just go out and
kill the guy. Kill him, Rock.

44:49.396 --> 44:50.938
He's scared.

44:51.857 --> 44:53.816
I'm the new champion. I'm
the new champion as of today.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.109
I'm the new champion as of today.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.153
The Italian Stallion.
A rugged champion

44:57.237 --> 45:00.698
in the final fight of his
colorful career tonight.

45:00.782 --> 45:02.116
And Jimmy Lennon
was correct.

45:02.242 --> 45:04.577
He looks like...
Well, just great.

45:05.287 --> 45:09.081
Here we go! Oh, boy, the
champion came out swinging.

45:09.166 --> 45:10.416
Break his head!

45:10.500 --> 45:12.543
Balboa's off to
an incredible start!

45:12.627 --> 45:16.047
He looks determined to
destroy the bigger challenger.

45:18.675 --> 45:20.134
Clubber, get in
there, get in there!

45:20.218 --> 45:21.927
Move him back.
Move him back.

45:26.516 --> 45:27.933
Defense!

45:28.435 --> 45:29.894
Now it is Balboa.

45:29.978 --> 45:31.604
They're going at
each other now.

45:34.149 --> 45:36.442
You got him!
You got him, Rock!

45:36.818 --> 45:38.652
Double up!
Double up!

45:41.198 --> 45:44.658
Come on. Come on,
Balboa! Come on!

45:46.745 --> 45:50.289
The challenger is hitting
him with everything he's got.

45:50.540 --> 45:51.582
No!

45:52.501 --> 45:54.085
Come on, Balboa!

45:54.753 --> 45:57.046
Come on, Balboa!
Make me weak.

45:57.714 --> 46:00.549
Come on, Balboa!
Come on.

46:06.599 --> 46:09.893
Clubber away. Trying to
get him back to his corner.

46:09.977 --> 46:11.645
Grab him, Paulie.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.564
Where's Mick?
Where's Mick?

46:14.649 --> 46:15.732
He's okay.

46:15.817 --> 46:17.359
I need him now.
I need him here.

46:17.443 --> 46:20.404
He ain't nothing. I told you he
ain't nothing. He ain't nothing.

46:20.488 --> 46:21.780
He's too strong.

46:21.864 --> 46:23.907
Don't talk like that, Rocko. Come on.

46:23.991 --> 46:25.075
Tear him up!
I'm gonna smoke him.

46:25.159 --> 46:27.244
I'm gonna smoke him.
I'm gonna smoke him.

46:27.328 --> 46:29.830
I can't keep him off.
I can't keep him off.

46:30.164 --> 46:31.581
He's mine.
He's mine!

46:31.666 --> 46:33.083
I'm gonna get him!
I'm gonna get him!

46:33.167 --> 46:35.168
I'm losing it, Paulie.
Where's Mick?

46:37.338 --> 46:39.423
What do you got there? 200 over 50.

46:39.507 --> 46:41.550
All right,
let's start CPR.

46:42.468 --> 46:43.844
Rock, you can do it.

46:43.928 --> 46:45.011
I'll try.

46:46.639 --> 46:48.807
Rocky appears
to be staggering.

46:48.975 --> 46:50.434
Yeah, I'll get him.

46:50.518 --> 46:52.727
Coming out of the corner,
here comes Clubber.

46:54.105 --> 46:56.481
Come on, Rocky, show
him. Let's go. Come on.

46:56.566 --> 47:00.235
Come on, Balboa! Come on! Come
on, oversized hick! Give it to me.

47:00.319 --> 47:03.196
Let's see what you
can do. Bring it to me!

47:04.198 --> 47:05.866
Move on the inside!

47:07.034 --> 47:09.494
The champion
is nearly helpless.

47:09.579 --> 47:11.663
My gosh, what a beating he's taking.

47:16.544 --> 47:18.462
Don't stand
toe-to-toe with him!

47:18.546 --> 47:20.172
Come on, Balboa!

47:38.650 --> 47:39.859
Get up!

47:39.943 --> 47:43.154
Get up, sucker!

47:43.238 --> 47:45.448
Five. Six.
Come on, get up! Get up!

47:45.532 --> 47:50.995
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.
You're out!

47:51.246 --> 47:52.371
The champion
is finished!

47:52.498 --> 47:54.207
I did it! I'm the best!
In the second round!

47:54.291 --> 47:55.500
I'm the man!
I beat Balboa!

47:55.584 --> 47:57.168
Unbelievable.
Incredible upset.

47:57.252 --> 48:00.838
Balboa in the corner, out on
his feet. Out of the plank.

48:06.345 --> 48:08.387
We have the time.

48:08.472 --> 48:10.348
The winner by knockout,

48:10.432 --> 48:15.895
the new heavyweight champion
of the world, Clubber Lang!

48:15.979 --> 48:20.191
Yeah, I told you.
I told you I'd do it.

48:20.275 --> 48:23.319
Yeah! I'm the new
champ of the world!

48:32.037 --> 48:33.204
Come on,
get out of here!

48:33.288 --> 48:34.789
Get out of here, now.

48:39.461 --> 48:40.670
Oh, Rocky,
what happened?

48:40.754 --> 48:41.879
I'm all right,
how's Mick?

48:41.964 --> 48:43.590
He wouldn't go to the
hospital till you got here.

48:43.675 --> 48:45.592
What? Mr. Balboa, time is important.

48:45.677 --> 48:47.844
We must get him to the
hospital immediately.

48:47.929 --> 48:49.012
Okay.

49:03.027 --> 49:04.069
Mick?

49:04.821 --> 49:06.196
Yeah?

49:06.281 --> 49:07.489
Mick.

49:09.367 --> 49:13.495
What? What? What?
Is it over?

49:13.997 --> 49:17.291
Yeah, it's all over.

49:17.625 --> 49:21.003
Hey, listen,
what happened?

49:22.088 --> 49:23.797
It was a knockout.

49:25.675 --> 49:28.051
What round?
What round?

49:28.136 --> 49:29.970
Second round.

49:32.181 --> 49:33.724
Yeah, I knew it.

49:33.808 --> 49:36.351
That's good.
We did it, huh?

49:36.436 --> 49:39.229
We did it. We did it. All right.

49:39.314 --> 49:41.273
You don't have to worry
about nothing no more.

49:41.357 --> 49:42.608
No. Good.

49:42.692 --> 49:44.109
Everything's gonna be okay, Mick.

49:44.193 --> 49:46.236
You know? Yeah. I knew that we did it.

49:46.321 --> 49:48.697
You gotta get
to the hospital.

49:48.823 --> 49:51.158
You're not as young
as you used to be.

49:51.242 --> 49:53.827
You're the winner.

49:53.911 --> 49:56.663
We did everything right.
I did everything...

49:56.748 --> 49:59.625
No, no, listen. We ain't
done everything right.

49:59.709 --> 50:01.628
Listen, we got
more to do.

50:01.712 --> 50:04.797
Mick, whatever you wanna
do, we'll do it, okay?

50:04.882 --> 50:07.634
I love you, kid.
I love you.

50:08.886 --> 50:10.720
Mick?

50:10.804 --> 50:12.597
It hurts me.

50:15.184 --> 50:16.309
Mick?

50:20.731 --> 50:21.939
Mick?

50:30.574 --> 50:31.908
Mick.

50:43.962 --> 50:46.172
Oh, God!

50:52.596 --> 50:56.391
Don't go away,
please, don't.

50:56.475 --> 50:59.352
All the things
we didn't do.

50:59.436 --> 51:02.355
We got more
to do. We got...

51:03.607 --> 51:08.277
Oh, my God!
Oh, Jesus.

52:07.255 --> 52:09.673
This concludes
our service.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.393
That's not
the way to do it.

55:06.478 --> 55:07.853
Who's that?

55:09.189 --> 55:12.149
Why don't you hit it
straight? Step into it.

55:14.527 --> 55:16.320
Apollo?

55:16.404 --> 55:19.366
Right. I waited at your
house for about an hour

55:19.450 --> 55:22.077
and your wife said
you might be here.

55:22.453 --> 55:24.037
What are you
doing here?

55:24.163 --> 55:25.705
Business.

55:27.291 --> 55:29.167
If the papers knew we
were talking like this,

55:29.251 --> 55:31.378
they'd think
we was crazy.

55:31.963 --> 55:33.296
Why you?

55:33.381 --> 55:36.591
Because I'm the best, and you need
somebody to teach you different.

55:36.717 --> 55:38.843
Why? Well, to be honest with you,

55:38.928 --> 55:41.179
I don't think you could
pull it off without me, Rock.

55:41.263 --> 55:45.850
You still didn't give me the answer,
Apollo. What's the real reason?

55:45.935 --> 55:48.228
Listen. It's quiet,
isn't it?

55:49.689 --> 55:51.940
When you retire,
it's too quiet.

55:52.066 --> 55:54.359
I mean, we're too
young to retire anyway.

55:54.443 --> 55:56.695
Besides, with
the right touch,

55:56.779 --> 55:58.989
I could promote this thing into
the biggest gig of all time.

55:59.073 --> 56:00.865
It'd be bigger
than ours.

56:00.950 --> 56:05.161
Heaven knows, I don't mind being
involved with large numbers, right?

56:06.706 --> 56:09.249
I don't need this
no more. I...

56:09.333 --> 56:11.459
I don't want
this no more.

56:12.211 --> 56:17.465
Look, man. When you
beat me, I hurt all over

56:17.550 --> 56:21.761
and I didn't want to know from
nothing or nobody, not even my kids.

56:21.846 --> 56:23.930
Hell, every fighter
knows that hurt.

56:24.015 --> 56:27.183
And we get sick inside trying to
live with it, so don't back off now.

56:27.268 --> 56:31.187
Make it right for yourself
or you'll be sorry you didn't.

56:31.272 --> 56:34.691
We held the greatest title
in the whole world, babe.

56:36.611 --> 56:39.030
You lost that fight, Rock,
for all the wrong reasons.

56:39.114 --> 56:41.490
You lost your edge.

56:41.575 --> 56:46.454
All right, I know your manager
dying had you all messed up inside.

56:47.456 --> 56:50.166
But the truth is, you
didn't look hungry.

56:50.876 --> 56:52.752
Now, when we fought,

56:53.754 --> 56:56.797
you had that eye of the
tiger, man, the edge.

56:56.882 --> 56:58.215
And now you
gotta get it back.

56:58.300 --> 57:00.593
And the way to get it back is
to go back to the beginning.

57:00.677 --> 57:03.846
You know
what I mean?

57:03.930 --> 57:06.474
Maybe we could win
it back together.

57:08.226 --> 57:10.102
Eye of the tiger, man.

57:13.940 --> 57:16.067
Why'd you have
to come here?

57:17.069 --> 57:19.487
I have the plan.
Get back, man.

57:22.574 --> 57:24.325
You got me curious.

57:26.328 --> 57:28.329
You got me curious, Rock.

57:33.085 --> 57:37.129
Clubber, do you accept the
challenge for a rematch with Balboa?

57:37.214 --> 57:40.591
I reject the challenge,
because Balboa is no challenge.

57:40.675 --> 57:43.135
But I'd be more than happy
to beat up on him some more.

57:43.220 --> 57:44.970
I always said
he was nothing.

57:45.055 --> 57:46.764
I can't wait to
see this bum fall.

57:46.848 --> 57:49.934
What do you think of him
being trained by Apollo Creed?

57:50.018 --> 57:51.310
Apollo who?

57:51.394 --> 57:53.521
You talking about that
old fool, Apollo Creed?

57:53.647 --> 57:55.816
Shucks, one has-been teaching
another. Yeah, just keep talking, pal.

57:55.900 --> 57:56.942
That's all Apollo been
doing... Keep talking.

57:57.026 --> 57:58.610
...running off at
the mouth lately.

57:58.694 --> 58:00.904
And when I see him, I'm
gonna close it for him.

58:00.988 --> 58:03.657
All right. When will
the match take place?

58:03.741 --> 58:04.908
The sooner,
the better.

58:04.992 --> 58:06.201
I'm the champion
of the world.

58:06.285 --> 58:07.661
And nothing can
be done about that.

58:07.745 --> 58:10.038
I can't be beat,
and I won't be beat.

58:10.123 --> 58:11.748
This time I'm gonna
train even harder.

58:11.833 --> 58:13.375
There won't be no
quick knockdowns.

58:13.459 --> 58:14.751
I'm gonna torture him.

58:14.836 --> 58:17.045
I'm gonna crucify
him real bad.

58:17.213 --> 58:19.422
Hard words
from a hard man.

58:19.507 --> 58:23.385
The odds against Balboa
making a comeback at 34

58:23.469 --> 58:25.220
are very long indeed.

58:25.304 --> 58:28.473
Can he do it?
Most experts doubt it.

58:28.558 --> 58:33.812
Balboa was a fine champion, but his
time has passed. I wish him luck.

58:35.064 --> 58:36.940
Don't listen
to it, Rocky.

58:37.024 --> 58:39.609
No, do listen
to it, Rock.

58:39.694 --> 58:44.072
When this is over, a lot of folks
are gonna owe you an engraved apology.

58:46.242 --> 58:47.534
And you're gonna
owe me a big favor.

58:47.618 --> 58:49.161
What favor?

58:49.912 --> 58:51.788
When it's over.

58:57.086 --> 59:00.380
Rocko, come on. We're gonna
be late at the airport.

59:01.549 --> 59:03.717
Let's go. Think we forgot anything?

59:04.093 --> 59:06.595
I think we have it all.
Maybe another sweater.

59:06.679 --> 59:08.471
No, California's
not that cold.

59:08.556 --> 59:10.307
It's great, great.
A scorcher.

59:10.391 --> 59:12.809
Okay, listen, I want you
to be a good boy, okay?

59:12.935 --> 59:15.354
Okay. And don't give
anybody a hard time.

59:15.439 --> 59:19.692
Okay.
Give me a kiss. Yeah.

59:25.949 --> 59:28.826
We'll call when we
land. Yeah, we'll call.

59:32.831 --> 59:35.208
You'll be a good
boy? All right.

59:35.292 --> 59:37.668
I'll bring you
back something.

59:52.351 --> 59:54.727
I been told by

59:56.063 --> 59:58.481
Some people and they all

59:59.691 --> 01:00:01.984
Say to take you back

01:00:04.154 --> 01:00:06.697
Take you back like before

01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:11.160
I don't call that a reason

01:00:12.537 --> 01:00:18.000
I just call it
believin' in myself

01:00:18.752 --> 01:00:21.295
Believin' in myself

01:00:23.257 --> 01:00:25.049
What the hell are
we doing here in LA?

01:00:25.133 --> 01:00:26.259
Hey, man, this is
where I started.

01:00:26.343 --> 01:00:27.426
Yeah, so?

01:00:27.511 --> 01:00:29.178
So this is
where he's starting.

01:00:29.263 --> 01:00:30.429
But this place
is disgusting.

01:00:30.514 --> 01:00:31.597
Why don't we stay
at your place?

01:00:31.682 --> 01:00:33.267
Look, I think you're missing the point.

01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:35.727
Let's just go on and check in and
get over to the gym, all right?

01:00:35.812 --> 01:00:38.272
Rock, in my opinion,
we don't need this place.

01:00:38.356 --> 01:00:40.107
It's below you and
the sister's standard.

01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:43.485
We're gonna give it a try,
Paulie. Come on, Adrian.

01:00:54.747 --> 01:00:56.498
I don't even
have a gun.

01:01:04.215 --> 01:01:05.257
You know,
fun is fun.

01:01:05.341 --> 01:01:09.094
I like those kind of things, but
this I don't like. Look at this place.

01:01:09.178 --> 01:01:12.639
Rats even have more pride
than to be caught dead here.

01:01:13.641 --> 01:01:15.726
I mean, look
at the dump.

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:17.019
I just don't like it.

01:01:17.103 --> 01:01:19.688
Think of Adrian's health.
I'm fine, Paulie.

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:43.879
Balboa.

01:01:43.963 --> 01:01:45.255
What's he
doing out here?

01:01:51.722 --> 01:01:53.848
This is where
I started.

01:01:53.932 --> 01:01:55.433
That's your problem.

01:01:55.851 --> 01:01:57.935
Rocko, let's leave before
they leave us for dead.

01:02:01.273 --> 01:02:04.233
Yeah, you see that look
in their eyes, Rock?

01:02:05.736 --> 01:02:07.320
When we fought, Rock,
I trained hard,

01:02:07.404 --> 01:02:08.529
but I didn't have
that look in my eyes.

01:02:08.614 --> 01:02:10.948
You had it.
You won.

01:02:12.785 --> 01:02:15.036
You gotta get
that look back, Rock.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.704
Eye of the tiger, man.

01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:18.498
Eye of the tiger,
come on.

01:02:18.582 --> 01:02:20.416
Come on, let's go.

01:02:20.501 --> 01:02:23.461
Look at this place.
No class in here.

01:02:23.545 --> 01:02:24.879
Is he always
so cheerful?

01:02:24.963 --> 01:02:26.297
I don't sweat you.

01:02:26.382 --> 01:02:28.716
Hey. Hey, Paulie. Don't
get mentally irregular.

01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:30.134
It's a free country.

01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:31.928
Just don't get irregular, all right?

01:02:32.012 --> 01:02:34.263
I don't need no
philosophy lesson here.

01:02:34.348 --> 01:02:36.391
Well, it just takes about
six years to get to know...

01:02:36.475 --> 01:02:38.935
Well, I ain't
got six years.

01:02:39.019 --> 01:02:41.437
Hey, come on,
Paulie. Just relax.

01:02:41.563 --> 01:02:43.981
Come on. We're on business.

01:02:47.194 --> 01:02:49.112
Hey! Hey, champ!

01:02:49.196 --> 01:02:51.280
Hey, Duke, my man.

01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:52.824
Hey, everything's set
up and ready to go, baby.

01:02:52.908 --> 01:02:54.575
Good. I know you know who
this man is, don't you?

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.035
Yeah. It's gonna be
good working with you.

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.246
Certainly had enough
of working against you.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:02:59.997
Hey, how you feel?
Pretty good, thanks.

01:03:00.082 --> 01:03:01.582
He's doing great. We've
been living modern,

01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:03.084
but now we're
gonna train old.

01:03:03.168 --> 01:03:04.961
I'm going over here and talk
to some of the guys, all right.

01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:07.130
Hey! The
champ is home!

01:03:09.675 --> 01:03:12.428
We gotta leave.
I got a reputation.

01:03:12.512 --> 01:03:13.679
What do you mean,
reputation?

01:03:13.763 --> 01:03:16.223
You heard. I don't like these people.

01:03:16.307 --> 01:03:18.225
You don't like them?

01:03:19.644 --> 01:03:22.438
Maybe they don't like
you either, Paulie.

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.398
What'd I do to them?

01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:27.317
And they call
me punchy.

01:03:27.402 --> 01:03:30.612
Hey, Stallion, Stallion, come on
over here and meet some of the fellas.

01:03:30.697 --> 01:03:32.156
I'll be right back.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.032
How you doing, guys?

01:03:45.336 --> 01:03:47.963
That's it, that's it.
Come on, on the toes.

01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:49.465
On the toes,
on the toes.

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:51.091
On the toes, come on.

01:03:51.176 --> 01:03:52.676
On the toes,
on the toes.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.220
Come on, Rock.

01:03:55.972 --> 01:03:58.056
He ain't too graceful.

01:03:58.141 --> 01:03:59.808
That's why we're
here, Paulie.

01:04:00.101 --> 01:04:02.519
Waste of time.
He's got heavy feet.

01:04:02.604 --> 01:04:04.146
Get on the balls
of your feet.

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:06.190
Come on, relax, Rock.

01:04:06.274 --> 01:04:08.192
Come on, get those feet out
of the concrete. Come on.

01:04:08.276 --> 01:04:10.277
It'll take time,
but it'll come.

01:04:10.361 --> 01:04:13.780
He can't train to
the jungle junk music.

01:04:13.907 --> 01:04:15.991
Come on, relax, Rock. Here
we go. Here we go, come on.

01:04:16.117 --> 01:04:17.951
On the balls of your feet. Balance.

01:04:18.036 --> 01:04:19.077
Let your body
find the rhythm.

01:04:19.162 --> 01:04:21.788
Gonna start a new
dance called the crawl.

01:04:21.873 --> 01:04:24.500
I'm telling you, you can't
train him like a colored fighter.

01:04:24.584 --> 01:04:25.751
He ain't got
no rhythm.

01:04:25.835 --> 01:04:26.960
All right?
Come on.

01:04:27.045 --> 01:04:28.045
How stupid
do I look?

01:04:28.129 --> 01:04:29.631
You look great.
You look great.

01:04:29.715 --> 01:04:32.759
Everything we do works
off the jab. You can do it.

01:04:33.594 --> 01:04:34.677
Yeah.

01:04:35.679 --> 01:04:36.930
Can he swim?

01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:38.264
With a name
like Rock?

01:04:38.891 --> 01:04:40.475
No time to
waste! Let's go!

01:04:40.559 --> 01:04:42.060
Another lap!
Another lap!

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.062
Move it!
Another lap!

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:46.523
He ain't no tuna. We
belong back in the gym.

01:04:46.607 --> 01:04:48.149
Look, he's gotta stretch and use muscles

01:04:48.234 --> 01:04:50.193
he never thought he had. Come on, Rock!

01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:51.694
Come on, stretch now!

01:04:51.779 --> 01:04:53.321
Come on, move it,
Rock! Move it!

01:04:53.405 --> 01:04:54.572
Nobody can
change that much.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:57.033
He's a bruiser.
He ain't no boxer.

01:04:57.117 --> 01:04:59.035
You keep telling him
that and he'll be nothing.

01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:00.495
You know?
Yeah?

01:05:00.579 --> 01:05:02.455
Another lap! Come on now! Move it!

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:06.000
Move it! Come on!
Move it, Rock! Move it!

01:05:06.085 --> 01:05:08.044
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

01:05:08.212 --> 01:05:10.213
That's it, stretch it!
Stretch it out!

01:05:10.297 --> 01:05:13.258
That's it, let's go. You
gotta pull. Hard now, hard!

01:05:21.433 --> 01:05:24.644
Shut up, you Sterno bums!
I'll squash you!

01:05:25.145 --> 01:05:27.021
There's decent people trying to sleep!

01:05:27.106 --> 01:05:29.732
Shut up, you honky
scum bastard mother!

01:05:30.442 --> 01:05:32.610
Who needs
this sick place?

01:05:32.945 --> 01:05:34.153
I don't.

01:05:35.614 --> 01:05:36.864
No class.

01:05:40.494 --> 01:05:42.662
Damn, that
Clubber's strong.

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:45.456
Fifteen rounds is
a long time.

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:49.044
We gotta put
him away early.

01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:51.755
I figure with the
pace we gotta set,

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.301
Rock can last maybe
seven or eight rounds.

01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:59.763
Then we'll be
out of steam, man.

01:05:59.848 --> 01:06:02.016
We got to put
him away early.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.521
At least
the water's hot.

01:06:10.942 --> 01:06:13.569
Well, we never really had a honeymoon.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.364
It's not so bad.

01:06:19.826 --> 01:06:21.910
We've been in
worse places.

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:25.623
In the corner, Rocky's
in trouble in round two!

01:06:25.707 --> 01:06:27.041
He takes a right!
Another right!

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:29.043
He's been cut!
Rocky's been cut!

01:06:31.212 --> 01:06:34.298
Come on, Rock.
Come on, come on, now.

01:06:34.382 --> 01:06:36.800
Come on. You gotta get
tougher. You gotta get tougher.

01:06:36.885 --> 01:06:38.302
Think smooth.
Think smooth.

01:06:38.386 --> 01:06:39.553
Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

01:06:39.638 --> 01:06:41.847
Toes, toes, on
your toes, Rock.

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:44.099
On your toes! On your
toes! On your toes!

01:06:45.352 --> 01:06:47.811
Push yourself, Rock!
Concentrate.

01:06:47.896 --> 01:06:49.563
Let's move it, Rock!
Move it, now!

01:06:49.648 --> 01:06:51.523
Come on, Rock,
come on!

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:54.360
Have fun with this.
Have fun with it.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.987
That's it.
Easy, easy, easy.

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.156
Smooth. On the toes.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.575
Don't push it, don't
push it. Let it come.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.328
It'll come. This takes time, baby.

01:07:04.412 --> 01:07:06.205
This takes time. Come
on, move your head.

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:09.167
Move your head. Move
your head up and down.

01:07:09.251 --> 01:07:12.379
Come on, come on. Swift
now, up and down. In and out.

01:07:12.463 --> 01:07:15.924
Inside. Inside.
Inside, baby.

01:07:16.008 --> 01:07:17.217
Side to side.
Move your head.

01:07:17.301 --> 01:07:18.510
Watch it now.
Watch it now.

01:07:18.594 --> 01:07:20.845
Remember, he's got
two hands, right?

01:07:25.267 --> 01:07:27.352
Damn, man, what the hell are you doing?

01:07:27.436 --> 01:07:29.688
This guy will knock you on your ass!

01:07:31.982 --> 01:07:34.025
Come on, Rock,
it's not a game.

01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:38.029
You want to lay up in a hospital
for five weeks this time?

01:07:38.114 --> 01:07:40.532
You thought I was tough?
This chump will kill you.

01:07:40.616 --> 01:07:41.741
All right.

01:07:41.826 --> 01:07:44.244
Come on, come on. Get your
head on your shoulders, man.

01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:46.371
Think about the fight!
Think about the fight!

01:07:46.455 --> 01:07:49.207
Clubber Lang's in, he's trying to hurt
you, Rock. He's trying to hurt you.

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:51.751
Okay, here it comes.
Jab! He's jabbing!

01:07:51.836 --> 01:07:53.461
He's jabbing! He's trying to hurt you.

01:07:53.546 --> 01:07:55.880
You gotta fight.
You gotta move.

01:07:57.842 --> 01:07:59.634
He's up
against the ropes!

01:07:59.719 --> 01:08:01.469
He can't get
out of the corner.

01:08:05.808 --> 01:08:08.268
He's hooked you! He's
hooked you! He's hooked you!

01:08:08.352 --> 01:08:10.145
Damn, Rock, come on!

01:08:11.105 --> 01:08:12.605
What's the matter
with you?

01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:14.899
Tomorrow. Let's
do it tomorrow.

01:08:14.984 --> 01:08:16.776
There is no tomorrow!

01:08:18.028 --> 01:08:19.821
There is no tomorrow!

01:08:20.698 --> 01:08:22.657
There is no tomorrow!

01:08:28.081 --> 01:08:29.790
Look, there's just one thing
that you gotta remember.

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:31.667
We gotta get
some speed.

01:08:31.752 --> 01:08:34.670
You gotta get some flexibility.
You gotta get some quickness.

01:08:34.755 --> 01:08:35.962
You understand?

01:08:36.046 --> 01:08:37.465
Quickness, endurance,
that's the end of it.

01:08:37.549 --> 01:08:40.176
That's the only thing we gotta
concern ourselves with, Rock.

01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:43.011
All right. Mickey never had me do this.

01:08:44.139 --> 01:08:46.557
Yeah. Okay,
here we go.

01:08:48.143 --> 01:08:49.435
Ready?

01:08:53.607 --> 01:08:54.607
Set.
Yeah.

01:08:54.691 --> 01:08:56.149
Go!

01:08:56.234 --> 01:08:58.819
Come on, come on!
Dig, dig, dig!

01:08:58.904 --> 01:09:00.904
Come on! Come on!

01:09:08.662 --> 01:09:10.163
Come on!

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.375
You
can't win, Rock.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.962
You ain't been hungry
since you won that belt.

01:09:19.174 --> 01:09:21.716
He'll knock you
into tomorrow, Rock.

01:10:05.263 --> 01:10:06.930
What's the matter?

01:10:08.432 --> 01:10:09.766
It's over.

01:10:10.309 --> 01:10:11.810
It's all over.

01:10:22.655 --> 01:10:24.781
What's the matter
with you?

01:11:00.318 --> 01:11:01.985
Can I
talk to you?

01:11:06.658 --> 01:11:07.867
I wanna ask you
something important

01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:09.994
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

01:11:10.871 --> 01:11:12.163
What?

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:15.041
Why did you come here?

01:11:16.335 --> 01:11:18.878
I just don't
want it no more.

01:11:18.962 --> 01:11:22.381
If it's over because you
want it to be over, I'm glad.

01:11:23.091 --> 01:11:24.175
I do.

01:11:25.594 --> 01:11:29.305
It's just, you've never quit
anything since I've known you.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.686
I don't know what
you want me to say.

01:11:35.771 --> 01:11:37.855
I mean, how?
What happened?

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:41.025
How did everything that
was so good get so bad?

01:11:42.027 --> 01:11:44.153
What's so bad?
Tell me, what?

01:11:44.237 --> 01:11:47.406
I wrecked everything by
not thinking for myself.

01:11:47.491 --> 01:11:49.659
I mean, why couldn't Mickey
tell me where I was really at,

01:11:49.743 --> 01:11:50.993
right from the start?

01:11:51.078 --> 01:11:52.703
He didn't have to
carry me and lie to me

01:11:52.788 --> 01:11:55.748
and make me think I was better
than I really was when I wasn't.

01:11:55.832 --> 01:11:57.208
He never lied.

01:11:57.292 --> 01:11:59.460
Those fights weren't right.
They weren't, Adrian.

01:11:59.544 --> 01:12:01.420
I never fought anybody
who was in their prime.

01:12:01.505 --> 01:12:03.923
There was always some angle
to hold on to the title

01:12:04.007 --> 01:12:05.758
longer than I should have had it.

01:12:05.842 --> 01:12:07.677
I mean, do you understand
what I'm saying here?

01:12:07.761 --> 01:12:10.471
I understand. But you've gotta
understand that he loved you,

01:12:10.555 --> 01:12:12.348
and that was his job,
protecting you.

01:12:12.432 --> 01:12:14.433
Well, that protecting
don't help nothing.

01:12:14.518 --> 01:12:15.810
It only makes
things worse.

01:12:15.894 --> 01:12:19.355
You wake up after a few years thinking
you're a winner, but you're not.

01:12:19.439 --> 01:12:20.898
You're really a loser.

01:12:20.983 --> 01:12:23.819
And so we wouldn't have had
the title as long. So what?

01:12:23.903 --> 01:12:25.696
At least it would've been real, Adrian.

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.030
It was real.

01:12:27.115 --> 01:12:29.825
Nothing is real if you
don't believe in who you are.

01:12:29.909 --> 01:12:32.411
I don't believe in myself no
more. Don't you understand?

01:12:32.495 --> 01:12:33.870
When a fighter don't
believe, that's it.

01:12:33.955 --> 01:12:35.831
He's finished.
It's over. That's it.

01:12:35.915 --> 01:12:37.582
That's not it!
That is it!

01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:39.084
Why don't you
tell me the truth!

01:12:39.168 --> 01:12:41.294
What are you putting
me through, Adrian?

01:12:41.379 --> 01:12:42.504
You wanna know the truth?

01:12:42.588 --> 01:12:44.506
The truth is, I don't
want to lose what I got.

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:46.383
In the beginning, I didn't
care about what happened to me.

01:12:46.467 --> 01:12:48.927
I'd go in a ring, I'd get
busted up, I didn't care.

01:12:49.012 --> 01:12:50.887
But now there's you,
there's the kid.

01:12:50.972 --> 01:12:52.305
I don't wanna
lose what I got!

01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:54.975
What do we have that
can't be replaced? What?

01:12:55.059 --> 01:12:58.103
A house? We got cars. We got money.

01:12:58.187 --> 01:13:00.188
We got everything
but the truth!

01:13:00.273 --> 01:13:01.857
What's the truth,
damn it?

01:13:01.941 --> 01:13:04.359
I'm afraid, all right?

01:13:04.444 --> 01:13:05.610
You wanna hear
me say it?

01:13:05.695 --> 01:13:07.821
You wanna break me down?
All right, I'm afraid!

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:09.906
For the first time in
my life, I'm afraid.

01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:11.450
I'm afraid, too!

01:13:11.534 --> 01:13:12.909
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

01:13:12.994 --> 01:13:14.411
There is.
For me there is!

01:13:14.495 --> 01:13:15.871
Why? You're human,
aren't you?

01:13:15.955 --> 01:13:18.498
Look, I don't know what I
am. All I know is I'm a liar,

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:20.584
and because of that
Mickey ain't here no more.

01:13:20.668 --> 01:13:22.627
You didn't push
him into anything!

01:13:22.712 --> 01:13:25.380
He was a grown man and
he did what he had to do.

01:13:25.465 --> 01:13:28.884
And you have no right to feel
guilty for what happened, you don't!

01:13:28.968 --> 01:13:31.636
You were a champion. And you
did what you were expected to do.

01:13:31.721 --> 01:13:34.598
You did what I and everybody
else thought you should do.

01:13:34.682 --> 01:13:37.642
And you wanna tell me that those fights
weren't real? That you were carried?

01:13:37.727 --> 01:13:39.061
Well, I don't
believe it!

01:13:39.145 --> 01:13:40.437
But it doesn't matter what I believe.

01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:43.649
Because you're the one that's gotta
carry that fear around inside you.

01:13:43.734 --> 01:13:46.736
Afraid that everybody's
gonna take things away.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.946
Afraid you're gonna be
remembered as a coward,

01:13:49.031 --> 01:13:51.199
that you're not
a man anymore.

01:13:51.283 --> 01:13:54.535
Well, none of it's true, but
it doesn't matter if I tell you.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.747
It doesn't matter, because you're
the one that's gotta settle it.

01:13:57.831 --> 01:13:58.915
Get rid of it!

01:13:58.999 --> 01:14:00.958
Because when all
the smoke has cleared

01:14:01.043 --> 01:14:03.044
and everyone's through
chanting your name,

01:14:03.128 --> 01:14:04.921
it's just gonna be us!

01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:06.214
And you can't
live like this.

01:14:06.298 --> 01:14:08.216
We can't live like this.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.593
Because it's gonna bother
you for the rest of your life.

01:14:10.677 --> 01:14:13.012
Look what it's
doing to you now.

01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:21.979
Apollo thinks you
can do it. So do I.

01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:25.608
But you. You've gotta wanna
do it for the right reasons.

01:14:25.692 --> 01:14:27.485
Not for the guilt
over Mickey,

01:14:27.569 --> 01:14:30.154
not for the people,
not for the title,

01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:32.657
not for money or me,
but for you.

01:14:33.784 --> 01:14:35.785
Just you,
just you alone.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.833
And if I lose?

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:45.378
Then you lose, but at least
you lose with no excuses.

01:14:46.672 --> 01:14:48.464
No fear.

01:14:48.549 --> 01:14:51.050
And I know you
could live with that.

01:14:58.809 --> 01:15:00.686
How'd you get so tough?

01:15:02.856 --> 01:15:04.731
I live with a fighter.

01:15:11.239 --> 01:15:12.906
I really love you.

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:21.790
I love you.

01:15:44.898 --> 01:15:46.857
No, no, no, Rock. No.

01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:48.650
Just flick it, just
flick it. Just flick it.

01:15:55.283 --> 01:15:57.743
Come on, one more time. Come on!

01:16:08.963 --> 01:16:10.797
Good. Five more laps.

01:16:13.551 --> 01:16:14.927
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it.

01:16:15.011 --> 01:16:16.929
There you go, come on.

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.960
Jab.

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.881
You got to
move it faster.

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:59.347
Faster! Faster!
Go on. Kick it.

01:17:02.393 --> 01:17:03.726
Very nice!

01:17:19.493 --> 01:17:20.660
Move your head.
Move your head.

01:17:20.744 --> 01:17:22.495
Move it.
Move your head.

01:17:23.122 --> 01:17:25.456
That's right, under!
Under and over.

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:27.709
Up and down.
Turn around.

01:17:28.168 --> 01:17:29.460
That was nice.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:39.471
Come on, pick them up now.
On your toes. On your toes.

01:17:39.556 --> 01:17:41.181
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:17:41.266 --> 01:17:42.808
Come on, now. Speed, speed, speed.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:45.477
Faster, faster, faster.
Yeah! Good.

01:17:47.147 --> 01:17:49.231
Ready. Ready.

01:17:56.031 --> 01:17:57.573
Rocky the fish!

01:18:28.355 --> 01:18:29.480
Yeah!

01:18:45.538 --> 01:18:47.081
All right!

01:18:54.047 --> 01:18:54.129
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:57.050
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Stu Nahan along with Bill Baldwin

01:18:57.134 --> 01:18:59.386
and we welcome you to
Madison Square Garden,

01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:02.555
a most exciting backdrop for
the anxiously awaited rematch

01:19:02.723 --> 01:19:05.266
Between the former
champion, Rocky Balboa

01:19:05.351 --> 01:19:07.894
and the reigning heavyweight
champion, Clubber Lang.

01:19:07.978 --> 01:19:11.940
We now switch to our remote
cameras inside the dressing rooms.

01:19:12.024 --> 01:19:15.068
Would you care to comment on
how you plan to fight Balboa?

01:19:15.152 --> 01:19:16.236
What's your strategy?

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.404
Don't need any.

01:19:17.488 --> 01:19:20.824
Balboa's so predictable and stupid,
the man comes straight ahead.

01:19:20.908 --> 01:19:23.701
He's tailor-made for me
and he's gonna get hurt.

01:19:23.786 --> 01:19:24.953
Just make sure you...

01:19:24.995 --> 01:19:27.789
That's good. ... turn them over. Good?

01:19:28.374 --> 01:19:30.375
How does that
look? Okay? Huh?

01:19:31.043 --> 01:19:33.753
No, I don't hate Balboa,
but I pity the fool,

01:19:33.838 --> 01:19:37.382
and I will destroy any man
who tries to take what I got.

01:19:41.178 --> 01:19:43.388
Remember where
you came from.

01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:46.808
Remember what it
took to get you here.

01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:50.061
And you remember what he
did to you last time, right?

01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:52.188
Since both men
are brawlers, Stu,

01:19:52.273 --> 01:19:54.149
with the edge in power
going to Clubber Lang,

01:19:54.233 --> 01:19:56.276
I would say that
the odds are very long

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.486
against Balboa
regaining his title.

01:19:59.196 --> 01:20:00.905
Now it's your turn.

01:20:01.198 --> 01:20:02.991
It's your turn, huh?

01:20:04.118 --> 01:20:06.327
What's your prediction
for the fight, then?

01:20:06.412 --> 01:20:08.371
Prediction?
Yes, prediction.

01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:11.958
Pain.

01:20:12.835 --> 01:20:15.629
Lang is a brawler who likes
to hurt a man to the body.

01:20:15.714 --> 01:20:19.300
And, you know, Balboa may never
have psychologically recovered

01:20:19.384 --> 01:20:21.927
from that vicious knockout
that Clubber laid on him.

01:20:23.722 --> 01:20:25.055
It's time.

01:20:27.184 --> 01:20:28.517
Here.
What?

01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:33.814
I want you to wear these.

01:20:36.234 --> 01:20:38.652
Come on, Apollo,
these are

01:20:38.737 --> 01:20:41.071
the colors that you wore
in our first fight together.

01:20:42.616 --> 01:20:43.741
I can't wear your colors.

01:20:43.825 --> 01:20:45.117
Just wear it.

01:20:46.411 --> 01:20:48.370
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:20:49.581 --> 01:20:51.248
Thanks, Apollo.

01:20:51.333 --> 01:20:52.833
You just
make sure you wash them

01:20:52.918 --> 01:20:54.293
before you bring
them back, all right?

01:20:54.377 --> 01:20:56.086
Will do, will do.

01:20:57.464 --> 01:20:58.839
Hey, thanks, Apollo.

01:20:58.924 --> 01:21:01.800
And remember, after
this you owe me a favor.

01:21:02.969 --> 01:21:04.345
What favor?

01:21:04.513 --> 01:21:05.554
Bill, I have to agree.

01:21:05.639 --> 01:21:09.642
Toe-to-toe, Lang is utterly
devastating and he's much too strong.

01:21:11.937 --> 01:21:14.355
All right, listen. I just wanna
tell you that I'm proud of you.

01:21:14.439 --> 01:21:16.023
It takes a hell of a man
to change, and you did it.

01:21:16.107 --> 01:21:17.191
You're gonna prove
it to them tonight, right?

01:21:17.275 --> 01:21:18.317
Right.
Right.

01:21:18.401 --> 01:21:20.110
You did good, Apollo.
Thanks, Paulie.

01:21:20.195 --> 01:21:22.238
Okay, let's do
it, Paulie.

01:21:23.907 --> 01:21:26.242
And here comes Rocky,
and here comes Apollo,

01:21:26.326 --> 01:21:27.743
the two former champions.

01:21:27.827 --> 01:21:30.329
Look at that United States
Marine Corps Color Guard there

01:21:30.413 --> 01:21:31.705
along with the Drum
and Bugle Corps.

01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:32.998
Aren't they magnificent?

01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:34.918
Tremendous. Take
a look at Rocky.

01:21:35.002 --> 01:21:37.921
Look at the tenseness in his
face, the tautness of that body.

01:21:38.005 --> 01:21:39.381
Boy does he look
serious right now!

01:21:39.465 --> 01:21:40.757
Oh, that he
certainly does.

01:21:40.841 --> 01:21:42.717
And you know, Stu,
the word is that

01:21:42.802 --> 01:21:45.637
this is Rocky's last fight,
win, lose or draw.

01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:48.056
And there he is,
the Italian Stallion,

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.392
Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring.

01:21:50.476 --> 01:21:52.435
Boy, he looks incredibly
thin, doesn't he?

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.063
I'd say he's gotta be
about 20 pounds lighter.

01:21:55.147 --> 01:21:57.899
Rocky Balboa, the iron
man from Philadelphia!

01:21:57.984 --> 01:22:00.902
And this crowd is certainly
with him tonight. Listen.

01:22:02.822 --> 01:22:04.990
Balboa doesn't really
have any boxing skill.

01:22:05.074 --> 01:22:06.449
I've never seen
a fighter, though,

01:22:06.576 --> 01:22:08.201
with as much
raw determination.

01:22:08.286 --> 01:22:10.203
Hold it, Stu.

01:22:10.288 --> 01:22:12.747
And here comes the
champion now, Clubber Lang.

01:22:12.832 --> 01:22:14.833
Listen to this crowd.

01:22:16.127 --> 01:22:17.669
Take a look
at those eyes.

01:22:17.753 --> 01:22:21.923
I've never seen a guy with
such sullen eyes. He is tough.

01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:24.551
Clubber, go back
where you came from!

01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:29.222
He even belted a spectator on
the way in. Did you see that?

01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:30.432
Look at that man.

01:22:30.516 --> 01:22:31.558
Boy, awesome.

01:22:31.642 --> 01:22:34.144
Awesome! Man, he's tough. Look at that.

01:22:34.228 --> 01:22:37.397
Clubber Lang, the heavyweight
champion of the world.

01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:38.648
Keep it loose,
keep it loose.

01:22:38.733 --> 01:22:40.942
Hey, fool, you ready
for another beating?

01:22:41.027 --> 01:22:43.153
You should've
never came back.

01:22:43.237 --> 01:22:45.947
Don't look at him.
Let's just be cool.

01:22:46.032 --> 01:22:50.243
Hey, boy.

01:22:50.328 --> 01:22:52.245
After I crucify him,
you're next.

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:54.290
Just stay out of
my face, chump.

01:22:54.374 --> 01:22:55.416
Don't turn your
back on me, sucker!

01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:57.043
We got a brawl
before the bell!

01:22:57.085 --> 01:22:59.045
Apollo and Clubber
go at it.

01:22:59.087 --> 01:23:00.963
This ring is
ready to explode.

01:23:01.048 --> 01:23:02.840
The fight about
to officially begin

01:23:02.924 --> 01:23:04.842
but these guys
wanna start now.

01:23:04.926 --> 01:23:06.636
Come on! Let me go! Let me go!

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:07.845
That's right,
I'm gonna get you!

01:23:07.929 --> 01:23:09.013
I'm gonna get you!
Let him go!

01:23:09.097 --> 01:23:10.389
Come on!

01:23:10.474 --> 01:23:12.266
Let him go! I want him! I want him!

01:23:12.392 --> 01:23:14.310
I thought you said be
cool. That was cool.

01:23:14.394 --> 01:23:15.936
I'm the champ!
I'm the champ!

01:23:16.021 --> 01:23:17.480
I'll beat you
like I did last time!

01:23:17.564 --> 01:23:20.441
You won't have to look
to find me. I'm here.

01:23:20.525 --> 01:23:24.278
Ladies, gentlemen and
boxing fans around the world,

01:23:24.363 --> 01:23:26.906
welcome to Madison
Square Garden

01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:29.992
and tonight's heavyweight
championship of the world.

01:23:31.536 --> 01:23:32.870
Oh, this crowd
is ready tonight.

01:23:32.954 --> 01:23:38.918
Out of the red corner, the
challenger, weighing 191 pounds

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.756
from the fighting
city of Philadelphia,

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.468
the former heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:23:47.552 --> 01:23:54.058
the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa!

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.400
I'll tell you something.
He has so slimmed down.

01:24:02.484 --> 01:24:03.693
He looks like a middleweight.

01:24:04.736 --> 01:24:09.907
Out of the blue corner,
weighing 237 pounds,

01:24:10.325 --> 01:24:13.412
the hard-punching
battler from Chicago,

01:24:13.496 --> 01:24:17.791
the reigning heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:24:17.875 --> 01:24:20.627
Clubber Lang!

01:24:21.879 --> 01:24:24.089
Referee Lou Filippo.

01:24:24.507 --> 01:24:26.341
Okay, boys,
let's go.

01:24:27.635 --> 01:24:29.428
We went over
the rules yesterday.

01:24:29.512 --> 01:24:31.012
I'm just going to
repeat a few of them.

01:24:31.347 --> 01:24:33.890
Let's watch the low blows
and the rabbit punches.

01:24:33.975 --> 01:24:36.893
In case of a knockdown, you
go to the corner I tell you to

01:24:36.978 --> 01:24:39.438
and you stay there until
I tell you to come out.

01:24:39.522 --> 01:24:41.982
Is that understood?
Any questions?

01:24:42.692 --> 01:24:45.902
Okay. Let's go back to
your corner now. Let's go.

01:24:45.987 --> 01:24:47.904
I'm gonna bust you up.

01:24:48.656 --> 01:24:49.990
Go for it.

01:24:51.993 --> 01:24:54.953
Well, here we go.
The war is on.

01:24:55.037 --> 01:24:56.621
We're just waiting
for the bell.

01:24:56.706 --> 01:24:58.707
Take my belt off. I'm
gonna get that chump.

01:24:58.791 --> 01:25:00.751
Don't let this bum let
you fight his fight.

01:25:00.835 --> 01:25:02.419
You're the best!
You're the best!

01:25:02.587 --> 01:25:04.045
Here you
go, champ.

01:25:05.173 --> 01:25:06.214
Rhythm and power,
rhythm and power.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.925
Keep that jab up.
Thanks.

01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:14.389
Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky!

01:25:14.515 --> 01:25:16.016
Are we ready
for round one now?

01:25:16.058 --> 01:25:17.225
Should be
a great fight.

01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:19.227
And here we go.

01:25:19.312 --> 01:25:22.564
And he goes right out of his
corner after Clubber Lang!

01:25:22.648 --> 01:25:25.233
He's throwing rights and
lefts into Clubber's face.

01:25:25.318 --> 01:25:26.735
What a start
of a fight here!

01:25:26.819 --> 01:25:29.196
Another jab.
Another jab.

01:25:30.364 --> 01:25:33.117
And another! This is not
the Rocky we expected!

01:25:33.202 --> 01:25:34.535
He looks fantastic.

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.412
He's fighting more
like Apollo Creed.

01:25:39.082 --> 01:25:40.625
Another right!

01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:43.753
A right! Look at that,
right and left to the head!

01:25:43.837 --> 01:25:46.130
Clubber Lang doesn't know
what's happening right now.

01:25:46.215 --> 01:25:47.965
He's being stung
by this style.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:49.926
Look at the shots
he's taking.

01:25:51.637 --> 01:25:53.054
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

01:25:53.138 --> 01:25:55.640
but he can't corner the
fleet-footed challenger.

01:25:55.724 --> 01:25:58.059
It's absolutely
unbelievable!

01:25:59.645 --> 01:26:00.853
Come on, is that
the hardest you can hit?

01:26:00.938 --> 01:26:02.396
Bring it to me!
Come on! Hit me!

01:26:02.481 --> 01:26:05.525
That right hand is
just like a trip hammer.

01:26:09.196 --> 01:26:10.738
Rock, tie him up!
Bring it to me. Come on.

01:26:11.907 --> 01:26:13.282
Break it up.
Get back. Get back.

01:26:13.367 --> 01:26:14.659
Come on. Get back.

01:26:14.743 --> 01:26:17.370
Tough first round.
Tough first round.

01:26:17.454 --> 01:26:20.832
It is Rocky with a couple of rights
and lefts, right to the head of Lang.

01:26:20.916 --> 01:26:21.999
Get off! Get off!

01:26:22.084 --> 01:26:23.626
Now it's Lang
coming back!

01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:26.295
This crowd is
going absolutely wild!

01:26:30.801 --> 01:26:34.178
There's a good left-right
combination by Rocky.

01:26:34.263 --> 01:26:35.304
And a good left hand.

01:26:35.389 --> 01:26:36.389
Go!

01:26:39.643 --> 01:26:42.478
This is Rocky
Balboa's night.

01:26:51.322 --> 01:26:52.823
Getting him
back to his corner.

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:55.909
We've got pandemonium in the
ring at the end of round one.

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:57.244
They're holding
Lang back.

01:26:57.328 --> 01:26:58.453
Lang wants more.

01:26:58.538 --> 01:27:00.706
He can't realize
that the round is over.

01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:03.333
He's trying to
get back to Rocky.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:05.294
All right, all right,
you look great.

01:27:05.378 --> 01:27:06.712
Just don't get crazy
and we're home.

01:27:07.964 --> 01:27:10.507
I'll kill you, man!
The man's strong.

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:13.093
Tell me when's the next round. I'm
gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him!

01:27:13.177 --> 01:27:15.178
I'm gonna kill him!

01:27:15.889 --> 01:27:17.556
Now, he's gonna come hard, right? Yeah.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.683
You keep crowding him. Don't
give him a chance to set.

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:22.686
Counter and move. Counter
and move. Counter and move.

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.563
And he had
Lang at his mercy.

01:27:24.647 --> 01:27:28.066
I don't think Lang knew what hit
him there in this whole first round.

01:27:28.192 --> 01:27:30.652
Here we go now.
The bell for round two.

01:27:30.737 --> 01:27:34.823
Now it's Lang coming out for
Rocky at the starting of round two.

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:39.411
Here he comes back, but Rocky is
still landing those rights and lefts.

01:27:39.495 --> 01:27:42.414
Right now in the center of
the ring, a right to the head.

01:27:42.498 --> 01:27:44.791
Another right to the head.
He's really setting him up.

01:27:44.876 --> 01:27:46.084
A right!
Right! Right!

01:27:46.169 --> 01:27:47.669
Five unanswered shots!

01:27:49.005 --> 01:27:50.756
Kill him! Kill him!

01:27:55.386 --> 01:27:56.678
Get out of there!

01:27:56.763 --> 01:27:58.013
Get
back there!

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:04.394
All right! All right!

01:28:05.605 --> 01:28:06.897
Get him off of him!
Let's go now!

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:09.442
Come on, break it up!
Break it up!

01:28:09.526 --> 01:28:10.610
What are you doing?

01:28:10.694 --> 01:28:12.445
Come on!
Come on, Balboa!

01:28:12.529 --> 01:28:14.113
Come on. I'm gonna
give it to you!

01:28:14.198 --> 01:28:17.784
Get those feet moving! Get
your hands up! Come on, Rock!

01:28:17.868 --> 01:28:19.869
That right
hand hurt Rocky again.

01:28:19.954 --> 01:28:21.788
What a fight!

01:28:22.373 --> 01:28:25.917
He's got him cornered. Balboa's
a little in trouble now.

01:28:30.089 --> 01:28:32.215
Hold him, damn it!
Hold him!

01:28:33.676 --> 01:28:35.134
Come on, Rocky,
come on!

01:28:35.219 --> 01:28:36.928
This is Clubber's round so far.

01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:38.888
Lang's taken
momentum here.

01:28:40.224 --> 01:28:42.392
He's railing away
at Balboa.

01:28:43.894 --> 01:28:46.104
And Balboa is down!

01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:48.982
You think you're bad?
Get up. Get up, damn it!

01:28:49.066 --> 01:28:50.984
Come on! Come on!
Five.

01:28:51.068 --> 01:28:52.443
Can he get up?
Can he get up?

01:28:52.528 --> 01:28:54.195
He's in trouble,
but he's up.

01:28:54.279 --> 01:28:55.905
Six. Seven.

01:28:57.866 --> 01:29:00.159
Here comes Clubber again.
Lang with the left hand.

01:29:00.244 --> 01:29:02.745
Lang with another
left and now a right.

01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:05.081
A right! Another right!
A right! Another right!

01:29:05.165 --> 01:29:07.291
And down goes
Balboa again.

01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:09.961
Stop the fight.

01:29:10.045 --> 01:29:11.713
You better
stay down.

01:29:12.423 --> 01:29:14.215
I got some moves
if you get up.

01:29:14.299 --> 01:29:16.509
I got a lot of moves. I
got a lot of moves. Come on.

01:29:16.593 --> 01:29:19.137
Here we go again.
Clubber coming into him.

01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:21.347
Come on,
come on, fool.

01:29:24.268 --> 01:29:26.310
You ain't so bad.
You ain't so bad.

01:29:26.395 --> 01:29:28.355
You ain't so bad.
Come on.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.315
You ain't so bad.
You ain't nothing.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.650
You must be
crazy or something!

01:29:31.776 --> 01:29:33.736
I'm crazy? Yeah, I may be...
You're just a stupid fool!

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.362
...but I ain't
breathing heavy.

01:29:35.447 --> 01:29:37.865
He's a fool.
He's stupid.

01:29:37.949 --> 01:29:40.242
How could he come back
from a beating like that?

01:29:40.326 --> 01:29:42.453
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

01:29:42.537 --> 01:29:44.788
Look, it's strategy, that's
all. I know what I'm doing.

01:29:44.873 --> 01:29:46.331
No, you don't know
what you're doing!

01:29:46.416 --> 01:29:48.042
He's gotta come to you.
You're the champ.

01:29:48.126 --> 01:29:50.169
He's nothing.
He's mine.

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:52.337
You stand toe-to-toe with
this bum and he'll kill you!

01:29:52.422 --> 01:29:54.757
It doesn't take a man to stand
there and get their head beat off!

01:29:54.883 --> 01:29:56.967
Don't... He's getting
tired. He's getting tired.

01:29:57.052 --> 01:30:00.179
Don't go wasting your
punches. You're the champ.

01:30:00.263 --> 01:30:02.056
Don't try to take him
out with one punch!

01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.223
Use your head.

01:30:03.308 --> 01:30:05.726
Now, you wear him
down. He's all ours.

01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:07.603
I know what I'm doing, I
swear. I know what I'm doing.

01:30:07.687 --> 01:30:09.354
Don't tell me
what you think!

01:30:09.481 --> 01:30:10.647
Go out there
and do it, Rock.

01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:12.107
Eye of the tiger.
You understand?

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:13.400
Yeah.

01:30:13.485 --> 01:30:14.860
Go out there and
knock his head off.

01:30:14.944 --> 01:30:17.071
He's just a man, Rock.
He's just a man.

01:30:17.947 --> 01:30:19.782
Be more man than him!
Go get him.

01:30:19.866 --> 01:30:21.742
Eye of the tiger!
Eye of the tiger!

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:23.327
Up and down.
Side to side.

01:30:23.411 --> 01:30:25.537
All right, this is the
beginning of round three.

01:30:25.622 --> 01:30:27.790
Tough rounds to
call right now.

01:30:27.874 --> 01:30:29.500
This is a little
slower in the start.

01:30:29.584 --> 01:30:31.835
It's my round.
It's my round.

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.253
I'm gonna take
you this time.

01:30:33.338 --> 01:30:37.049
I'm gonna take you.
You're mine. You're mine.

01:30:37.175 --> 01:30:40.010
Come on. Come on. I'm gonna
get you. I'm gonna get you.

01:30:43.181 --> 01:30:46.309
And Rocky throws him three rights
to the head and a left. He is back.

01:30:46.393 --> 01:30:49.270
He's your heavyweight.

01:30:51.982 --> 01:30:54.317
Rock, get out
of there! Get out!

01:30:56.028 --> 01:30:58.530
A sharp left-hand
right to the head.

01:30:59.365 --> 01:31:01.282
Get out of there!

01:31:01.367 --> 01:31:02.659
Come on.

01:31:02.743 --> 01:31:04.285
Stick him! Stick him!

01:31:07.039 --> 01:31:08.790
Come on! Come on!

01:31:09.416 --> 01:31:10.583
Come on!

01:31:10.668 --> 01:31:12.377
Again, again!

01:31:12.586 --> 01:31:14.504
He's getting killed.
Oh, no, no, no.

01:31:14.588 --> 01:31:16.506
He's not getting killed,
he's getting mad!

01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:18.299
Come on, whole world's
watching. Knock me out.

01:31:18.384 --> 01:31:20.552
Come on, knock me out.

01:31:20.678 --> 01:31:23.638
Come on, harder. Hit me
hard. Hit me harder. Come on!

01:31:26.934 --> 01:31:29.018
No!

01:31:30.729 --> 01:31:32.438
Get out of there!

01:31:34.775 --> 01:31:35.942
Rocky!

01:31:38.737 --> 01:31:40.947
Come on, Rock.
Hands up, Rock.

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:42.824
Yeah.

01:31:44.076 --> 01:31:45.577
My mother hits harder
than that. Come on.

01:31:45.661 --> 01:31:47.203
A little harder. A little harder, champ.

01:31:47.288 --> 01:31:48.788
In the face. Come on.

01:31:48.873 --> 01:31:50.456
Again, come on, champ.

01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:53.084
Again, come on, champ. You ain't so bad!

01:31:53.169 --> 01:31:57.088
You ain't nothing!
You ain't nothing!

01:31:57.965 --> 01:32:00.341
Rocky! Rocky!

01:32:15.066 --> 01:32:16.984
I might believe
the strategy now.

01:32:17.068 --> 01:32:20.362
He's making Clubber Lang miss
now. You see how he drew him in?

01:32:20.447 --> 01:32:22.281
Now Rocky's
throwing the punches!

01:32:25.035 --> 01:32:27.286
Look at that! He's lifting
him right off the canvas

01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:30.122
with those powerful
punches to the ribs.

01:32:34.252 --> 01:32:37.463
He's coming. He's completely
psyched-out this guy.

01:32:38.423 --> 01:32:41.133
Lang has got to be
confused by all of this.

01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.972
Look at the condition Balboa is in
right now. Look at the condition.

01:32:47.057 --> 01:32:49.058
Somehow he's roared back.

01:32:53.438 --> 01:32:56.607
And Lang doesn't know
how to defend himself.

01:32:57.234 --> 01:32:59.026
Harder punches!
Now!

01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:01.362
What a comeback by Balboa!

01:33:08.745 --> 01:33:10.371
Come on. Come on.

01:33:11.498 --> 01:33:13.290
Come on. Come on.

01:33:14.834 --> 01:33:16.710
Come on. Come on!

01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:19.880
Yeah!

01:33:26.597 --> 01:33:28.682
The place
has gone bananas!

01:33:28.766 --> 01:33:30.767
It's a tremendous comeback!

01:33:30.851 --> 01:33:32.143
Get up!

01:33:32.228 --> 01:33:35.438
Five. Six. Seven.

01:33:35.523 --> 01:33:36.690
Seven.

01:33:36.774 --> 01:33:38.942
Eight. Nine.
Nine.

01:33:39.026 --> 01:33:41.695
Ten. You're out!

01:33:43.072 --> 01:33:45.073
The new heavyweight
champion again!

01:33:45.157 --> 01:33:47.617
He's down on the floor in ecstasy!

01:33:47.994 --> 01:33:50.620
Bowing, praying there,
beating the floor!

01:33:50.705 --> 01:33:54.124
And there he is, the new
heavyweight champion of the world,

01:33:54.208 --> 01:33:56.960
Rocky Balboa!

01:33:59.338 --> 01:34:01.214
Rocky is exhausted!

01:34:03.718 --> 01:34:05.260
We did it!

01:34:06.512 --> 01:34:09.889
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner by knockout...

01:34:10.224 --> 01:34:11.891
Are you all right?

01:34:12.059 --> 01:34:14.227
Never better.
Never better.

01:34:14.312 --> 01:34:18.481
Once again the heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:34:18.566 --> 01:34:24.195
the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa!

01:34:32.705 --> 01:34:32.954
Come on, come on!
We made a deal.

01:34:32.955 --> 01:34:34.331
Come on, come on!
We made a deal.

01:34:34.415 --> 01:34:36.624
I know, but this is extremely crazy.

01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:37.709
Yeah, it's mentally
irregular, right?

01:34:37.793 --> 01:34:38.793
Yeah.

01:34:38.878 --> 01:34:40.253
But it makes all
the sense in the world.

01:34:40.338 --> 01:34:41.671
You owe me a favor.

01:34:41.756 --> 01:34:44.592
I know, but when did
you think of this?

01:34:44.676 --> 01:34:46.427
About three years ago.

01:34:46.511 --> 01:34:48.346
This is very crazy, Apollo.

01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:49.513
Look, Stallion.

01:34:49.598 --> 01:34:52.475
Now look, when you won that last
fight, you won by one second.

01:34:52.559 --> 01:34:54.185
You beat me by one
second. One second.

01:34:54.269 --> 01:34:56.270
That's very hard for a man
of my intelligence to handle.

01:34:56.355 --> 01:34:59.815
Is it? But didn't you say after I beat
you, you learned how to live with it?

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.776
I lied.
Oh, you lied.

01:35:03.111 --> 01:35:05.404
So now you just gotta
prove it to yourself?

01:35:05.489 --> 01:35:06.489
Just for myself.

01:35:06.573 --> 01:35:08.699
No TV, no newspapers, just you and me.

01:35:08.784 --> 01:35:10.201
Nothing.
Just you and me.

01:35:10.285 --> 01:35:11.660
Age before beauty.

01:35:11.745 --> 01:35:12.953
Anything you say,
Stallion.

01:35:13.038 --> 01:35:14.705
I'll do all the work,
okay.

01:35:15.248 --> 01:35:17.208
I'll tell you, Apollo,
you better go slow

01:35:17.292 --> 01:35:19.543
because you ain't as young
as springtime anymore.

01:35:19.628 --> 01:35:22.004
I'm still young enough
to whip your butt, Stallion.

01:35:22.089 --> 01:35:24.173
Oh, yeah? Well, how you gonna do that?

01:35:24.257 --> 01:35:25.800
You taught me
everything you know.

01:35:25.926 --> 01:35:27.468
Almost everything.

01:35:27.552 --> 01:35:29.512
You gotta remember now, you fight great,

01:35:29.596 --> 01:35:32.098
but I'm a great fighter.
You ready?

01:35:32.808 --> 01:35:34.058
Absolutely.

01:35:34.142 --> 01:35:35.309
All right.

01:35:35.394 --> 01:35:38.854
You know, Stallion, it's too
bad we gotta get old, huh?

01:35:40.982 --> 01:35:43.150
Just keep punching, Apollo.

01:35:44.986 --> 01:35:46.737
Wanna ring the bell?

01:35:46.988 --> 01:35:48.322
All right.

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:49.949
Ding, ding.

01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:53.327
Come on, Stallion.

01:35:54.246 --> 01:35:56.414
Come on. Come on.

01:35:56.498 --> 01:35:59.583
Boy, you really move
good for an older guy.

01:36:00.752 --> 01:36:02.337
You're looking good,
Stallion.

01:36:02.422 --> 01:36:03.964
I taught you well.

01:36:04.048 --> 01:36:06.007
I think you
taught me too good.

01:36:06.092 --> 01:36:08.051
Looking fly.
Look out now.

01:36:08.136 --> 01:36:09.761
No, no.
You don't want any of this.

01:36:09.846 --> 01:36:11.513
Come on. Come on.

01:36:12.223 --> 01:36:14.057
Maybe I'm in here
with the wrong guy.

01:36:14.183 --> 01:36:15.725
Come on, watch yourself. Ready?

01:36:17.311 --> 01:36:20.522
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight

01:36:20.606 --> 01:36:24.943
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rival

01:36:25.027 --> 01:36:29.364
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

01:36:29.449 --> 01:36:36.288
And he's watchin' us all
with the eye of the tiger

01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:43.378
Risin' up back on the street

01:36:44.005 --> 01:36:47.215
Did my time, took my chances

01:36:48.468 --> 01:36:51.678
Went the distance,
now I'm back on my feet

01:36:51.762 --> 01:36:55.557
Just a man and
his will to survive

01:36:56.642 --> 01:37:00.437
So many times,
it happens too fast

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:04.232
You trade your
passion for glory

01:37:05.401 --> 01:37:09.237
Don't lose your grip
on the dreams of the past

01:37:09.322 --> 01:37:13.450
You must fight
just to keep them alive

01:37:13.534 --> 01:37:17.913
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight

01:37:17.997 --> 01:37:22.335
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rival

01:37:22.419 --> 01:37:26.756
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:33.554
And he's watchin' us all
with the eye of the tiger

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:40.269
Face to face, out in the heat

01:37:41.438 --> 01:37:44.106
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry

01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:49.028
They stack the odds
till we take to the street

01:37:49.112 --> 01:37:52.865
For we kill with
the skill to survive

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:57.662
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight

01:37:57.746 --> 01:38:02.083
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rival

01:38:02.167 --> 01:38:06.504
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

01:38:06.588 --> 01:38:13.427
And he's watchin' us all
with the eye of the tiger

01:38:21.144 --> 01:38:24.313
Risin' up, straight to the top

01:38:25.482 --> 01:38:28.109
Have the guts, got the glory

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.446
Went the distance,
now I'm not gonna stop

01:38:33.282 --> 01:38:36.993
Just a man and
his will to survive

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:41.707
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight

01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:46.128
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rival

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:50.549
And the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

01:38:50.633 --> 01:38:56.638
And he's watchin' us all
with the eye

01:38:57.348 --> 01:39:00.767
Of the tiger

01:39:09.861 --> 01:39:12.237
The eye of the tiger

01:39:18.661 --> 01:39:22.539
The eye of the tiger

01:39:23.305 --> 01:39:29.232
