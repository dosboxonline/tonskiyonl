Ray Robinson?

14:21.764 --> 14:24.266
I'm Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

14:24.350 --> 14:27.311
Oh, hey ... hey, hey, Jack!
How you doing, man?

14:27.353 --> 14:28.562
Good. Oh, good.

14:28.646 --> 14:30.272
How about us makin'
a record together?

14:30.314 --> 14:32.399
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hell, yeah! Let's do that.

14:32.483 --> 14:33.651
Can I help you?

14:33.734 --> 14:34.777
I don't think so.

14:34.818 --> 14:37.112
We're just talking
a little business.

14:37.196 --> 14:40.366
Then you need to talk to me,
'cause I'm his manager.

14:40.783 --> 14:42.159
Whichever way the wind blows.

14:42.243 --> 14:43.369
It's blowing.

14:43.452 --> 14:44.995
Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

14:45.079 --> 14:46.956
- Marlene Andres.
- Marlene?

14:46.997 --> 14:48.499
- Gossie McGee.
- Gossie McGee.

14:48.582 --> 14:49.792
Great set, baby.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.835
We're going to talk
with Mr. Lauderdale here.

14:51.877 --> 14:53.212
Come on, Jack. I'm buying.

14:53.295 --> 14:54.713
I'm coming in, uh, to talk to him.

14:54.797 --> 14:56.840
You are doing a fabulous job!

14:56.924 --> 14:57.967
Yes, man.

14:58.008 --> 15:00.010
Eh, look, let's talk to him
about this record.

15:00.094 --> 15:02.179
Hey, no, no, we're gonna
let Marlene handle that.

15:02.263 --> 15:04.181
You get Oberon
to call you a cab, all right.

15:04.265 --> 15:05.808
Great set, Ray.

15:06.934 --> 15:08.143
Goss!

15:08.185 --> 15:10.312
Hey, daddy-o, want a smoke?

15:10.854 --> 15:12.856
I got some gage, fresh off the boat.

15:12.898 --> 15:14.358
It's clean and seedless.

15:14.441 --> 15:16.193
So that's how it is, huh?

15:16.402 --> 15:19.196
You keep me high
while they talk the business?

15:19.363 --> 15:21.073
I ain't the one playing you, man.

15:24.201 --> 15:25.494
Oberon, listen ...

15:25.786 --> 15:29.164
You know, Marlene and Gossie are the
ones running the game on you, Ray.

15:29.206 --> 15:30.291
What?

15:30.374 --> 15:32.877
They sliced up the pie
the first night you played.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.670
35 percent off the top.

15:34.753 --> 15:36.797
Plus Gossie's
double scale as leader.

15:37.214 --> 15:38.507
Leader?
If anybody's leading the band,

15:38.549 --> 15:40.759
I'm the one that's the leader.

15:41.051 --> 15:42.595
Forget the bo' humps.
You know what?

15:42.678 --> 15:44.013
I ... I'm ... I'm gonna go
my own way.

15:44.096 --> 15:45.973
Who's gonna book your gigs?

15:46.098 --> 15:48.017
Marlene's got you locked up.

15:48.058 --> 15:50.853
And she ain't gonna give up
her golden goose.

15:50.978 --> 15:53.689
♪ Straighten up and fly right ♪

15:53.731 --> 15:56.275
♪ Cool down, papa,
don't you blow your top ♪

15:56.358 --> 15:58.527
Hey, Ray Robinson,
you are fantastic.

15:59.445 --> 16:01.739
There you go. Give me some skin.

16:03.365 --> 16:04.450
What's that?

16:04.533 --> 16:05.701
Jack's card.

16:05.784 --> 16:07.870
I got his number at the hotel.

16:13.709 --> 16:15.669
Come on, Q.
It's not that complicated.

16:15.753 --> 16:17.046
Now let's just play it again.

16:17.129 --> 16:18.964
That's a B flat, C 7, scale it up,

16:19.048 --> 16:20.966
and triple it off the back end.

16:23.260 --> 16:25.429
Yeah, nigger! Yeah, that's it.

16:26.972 --> 16:30.059
Ray, what did I tell you
about cookin' in the dark?

16:30.100 --> 16:31.769
Are you tryin'
to burn the house down?

16:31.852 --> 16:34.396
Think about it, Marlene. Uh ... uh,
what do I need the light for?

16:34.438 --> 16:36.232
Well, you don't need
to be cookin' anyway.

16:36.273 --> 16:37.858
We brought you
takeout from Oscar's.

16:37.942 --> 16:38.984
Well, get your money back.

16:39.068 --> 16:40.402
I got fried chicken right here.

16:40.486 --> 16:41.779
Come on, Seven-oh, try this.

16:41.862 --> 16:43.364
Yeah! About time.

16:45.199 --> 16:47.034
Hey, that's home-cooked,
right there.

16:47.117 --> 16:48.244
Mmm, no, thank you.

16:48.327 --> 16:49.745
This chicken is the mostest, huh.

16:49.787 --> 16:52.081
Just needs a little hot sauce
and it'll be perfect.

16:52.122 --> 16:54.166
Yeah. So, what did
Jack Lauderdale have to say?

16:54.250 --> 16:55.834
Oh, I clocked him
comin' out the gate.

16:55.918 --> 16:57.169
He's a two-bit hustler.

16:57.253 --> 16:58.420
Oh, I see.

16:58.462 --> 17:01.006
Yeah, turns out the only hit
that Swing Time ever had ...

17:01.090 --> 17:03.259
was Open the Door, Richard,
which was a joke record.

17:03.342 --> 17:05.219
Uh ... uh ... uh, what about him
recordin' me?

17:05.301 --> 17:07.637
Oh, he'll record you,
if we pay the freight.

17:07.805 --> 17:09.431
Scratch a liar, find a thief.

17:10.558 --> 17:12.059
What's that supposed to mean?

17:12.142 --> 17:13.352
This.

17:14.103 --> 17:15.980
You see I saw
Jack Lauderdale tonight,

17:16.063 --> 17:18.107
and he gave me a $500
advance on my record.

17:18.147 --> 17:20.442
He also said he'll put me
on the road with Lowell Fulson ...

17:20.483 --> 17:22.027
and pay me three times
what you pay.

17:22.111 --> 17:23.237
Now, that's a lie!

17:23.319 --> 17:26.740
Hey, no way he's not gonna put some
blind man on the road. Think about it.

17:26.824 --> 17:28.742
I mean, you ... you need
watchin' out for.

17:28.826 --> 17:31.036
And he ain't got the time to
look after you the way I do.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.539
Is that what you've been doing,
Gossie? Watchin' out for me?

17:33.622 --> 17:35.457
Is that why you get
paid double what I do?

17:37.001 --> 17:38.168
Who told you that?

17:38.252 --> 17:39.295
It's true, ain't it?

17:39.378 --> 17:41.380
You two have been
gaming me since I got here.

17:41.463 --> 17:43.424
Ray, baby, listen ...
I ain't listening to you!

17:43.507 --> 17:45.885
Ray, I've ... I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

17:45.968 --> 17:48.012
Then why aren't you talkin'?

17:50.389 --> 17:52.641
Um, look, Ray, Ray,
let's not do nothin' stupid.

17:52.683 --> 17:54.476
I might be blind,
but I ain't stupid!

17:54.518 --> 17:56.228
Q., get my bag from upstairs.

17:56.312 --> 17:57.438
- What?
- Get it!

17:57.521 --> 17:58.981
- Wha ... right now?
- Now.

17:59.064 --> 18:01.317
Ray, man, we done been
through a whole lot.

18:01.358 --> 18:04.111
Ray, now wait a minute.
I can explain everything.

18:04.403 --> 18:06.113
Think about what you're doing.

18:06.197 --> 18:08.032
Ray, Ray, now you're makin'
a big mistake.

18:08.115 --> 18:10.117
That clown is spoutin'
promises that he can't keep.

18:10.201 --> 18:11.952
You'd be a fool to follow him.

18:12.036 --> 18:13.329
Ray, Ray, we'll make a new deal!

18:13.412 --> 18:14.538
Whatever makes you happy!

18:14.622 --> 18:16.540
The deal is
you can lay the pipe now.

18:16.624 --> 18:20.044
You'll break your neck going down
these stairs by yourself. Hang on.

18:20.502 --> 18:21.545
Oh, man.

18:21.629 --> 18:25.382
Ray, I ain't never seen you do
nothing like that, man. Never.

18:25.466 --> 18:27.176
That ain't nothing, Seven-oh.

18:40.147 --> 18:41.982
Stop cheating, Ray.

18:42.816 --> 18:45.444
George, you can't catch me.
Come on.

18:45.528 --> 18:46.862
Aretha!

18:47.571 --> 18:48.864
Come on, George.

18:48.948 --> 18:51.450
Aretha Robinson,
have you lost your mind?

18:51.534 --> 18:54.828
Eula, you promised to split every
wash basket with me, fair and square!

18:54.912 --> 18:55.996
And I did!

18:56.080 --> 18:57.164
Hell, you did!

18:57.248 --> 18:59.333
You charge white folks
one thing and pay me another.

18:59.416 --> 19:00.834
Now who's gonna wash these?

19:00.918 --> 19:02.378
You can. Now pay me my money!

19:05.965 --> 19:07.967
Okay, I'm a-giving you
your two little dollars.

19:08.050 --> 19:10.177
But don't you be expectin'
no more work out of me!

19:10.261 --> 19:11.679
I got all I need out of you.

19:11.804 --> 19:13.264
Ray and George, come on!

19:13.305 --> 19:14.932
That's right.
Get out of my yard ...

19:15.015 --> 19:16.767
and don't y'all never come back!

19:19.687 --> 19:22.439
Y'all got to learn
to read and write real good,

19:22.523 --> 19:25.276
so you never have to work
for people like that.

19:25.359 --> 19:27.069
Scratch a liar, find a thief.

19:27.111 --> 19:28.112
Understand?

19:28.153 --> 19:29.321
Yes, Mama.

19:42.293 --> 19:44.920
Smell that, Ray.
Smell the success.

19:45.212 --> 19:46.630
We're in LA, man,

19:46.672 --> 19:48.966
the place where the Negro
comes to spread his wings.

19:49.049 --> 19:51.468
You ... you know, man, I know
my ears ain't deceivin' me.

19:51.510 --> 19:52.553
Is that Art Tatum?

19:52.636 --> 19:54.263
It sure is, baby.
You want to meet him?

19:54.346 --> 19:57.016
I ... I can't meet him.
A-Art Tatum is the most.

20:02.271 --> 20:06.734
So, Ray, we got to talk about
your name, man: Robinson.

20:06.817 --> 20:09.695
Sugar Ray got the Robinson
franchise all sewed up.

20:09.778 --> 20:13.449
So I'm thinkin' we go with
your middle name, Charles.

20:13.991 --> 20:15.367
As in, Ray Charles.

20:15.451 --> 20:17.161
I don't care
what you call me, man,

20:17.244 --> 20:19.038
just as long as my name's
on the record.

20:19.121 --> 20:20.497
But we're gonna toast to that.

20:20.581 --> 20:21.874
Hey, what's the haps, Jack?

20:21.957 --> 20:23.584
Oh, my goodness.
Give me some skin.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.711
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

20:25.794 --> 20:29.381
Lowell Fulson, meet your new
piano player: Ray Charles.

20:29.465 --> 20:32.009
Ray Charles, the blind sensation.

20:32.092 --> 20:35.888
Ow! Damn! I'm gonna use that
on the album cover.

20:35.971 --> 20:37.389
He's really the sensation.

20:37.473 --> 20:39.308
I ... I love your music,
Mr. Fulson.

20:39.350 --> 20:40.768
Uh, the man's got taste.

20:40.851 --> 20:43.145
Hey, and the man ain't
been on the road ...

20:43.187 --> 20:45.439
with a band before,
so now you take care of him.

20:45.522 --> 20:46.857
Like my own brother.

20:50.444 --> 20:51.695
Ray.

20:52.571 --> 20:53.697
I'm gonna be right back.

20:53.781 --> 20:54.823
All right.

20:55.366 --> 20:57.993
Yeah, you got the one
on the left.

20:58.035 --> 20:59.828
Look here,
let me do the talking.

21:28.649 --> 21:30.150
Don't go inside that place.

21:30.234 --> 21:31.694
You know what Mama said.

21:31.735 --> 21:34.238
Go home
and don't tell Mama nothin'.

21:34.738 --> 21:36.115
Go, George.

21:40.578 --> 21:42.413
George, get out of here!

22:08.188 --> 22:11.025
Hey, boy, who let you in?

22:11.275 --> 22:13.402
You must be Aretha's son, huh?

22:13.444 --> 22:15.696
Yes, sir. Ray Charles Robinson.

22:16.155 --> 22:18.908
I've been seeing you
sneakin' around here.

22:19.241 --> 22:20.910
You like the piano, huh?

22:21.493 --> 22:23.537
Come on, you want
to learn how to play?

22:23.621 --> 22:24.914
Come on over here.

22:24.955 --> 22:26.707
Let me show you how to play.
Come on.

22:26.790 --> 22:29.001
I'm gonna teach you how to play.

22:29.084 --> 22:32.004
What we'll do, I'm gonna teach
you three notes, right?

22:32.087 --> 22:34.173
This is the first note,
right here.

22:35.758 --> 22:36.842
Play that.

22:38.135 --> 22:40.346
And here's the second note,
right here.

22:41.513 --> 22:42.765
Play that.

22:44.475 --> 22:46.101
Here's the third note.

22:49.146 --> 22:50.439
Now, here's the way it goes.

22:50.522 --> 22:52.107
Listen. Listen closely, now.

22:55.861 --> 22:57.196
Play that.

22:58.781 --> 23:00.115
Good!

23:01.283 --> 23:03.035
Try the other notes.

23:11.877 --> 23:13.337
Every club we hit,

23:13.420 --> 23:15.881
it's your responsibility
to rehearse the band.

23:16.006 --> 23:18.008
These are some lazy-ass bastards,

23:18.092 --> 23:20.386
so you gotta make sure
that they don't slough off.

23:20.803 --> 23:22.930
You gotta be ready
and dressed to open the show.

23:23.013 --> 23:25.349
Now, Lowell likes to take
a nap before he goes on.

23:25.432 --> 23:28.477
You just do your thing
until he feels like comin' out.

23:28.561 --> 23:31.480
And when Lowell's playin',
you keep the band sharp.

23:31.522 --> 23:32.523
Uh ... uh, just one thing.

23:32.606 --> 23:33.524
What?

23:33.607 --> 23:35.734
Did Jack tell you that
I have to be paid in singles?

23:36.863 --> 23:39.247

you're gonna get your money.

Hey, what you doing, man?
Close the door, Fat!

27:14.411 --> 27:16.705
Say, Ray, we'll be in here
for a little while.

27:16.747 --> 27:19.542
Use the women's can,
down there on your right.

27:19.625 --> 27:21.168
I don't want to use
the women's can.

27:21.252 --> 27:22.294

27:44.358 --> 27:46.235

27:47.403 --> 27:49.113
Yeah, I must have slipped
on the wet.

27:49.196 --> 27:50.281
There's a pipe broke.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.907

You see it?

27:51.991 --> 27:53.909

27:53.951 --> 27:55.369
All right, quit playing, Ray.

27:55.452 --> 27:57.913

Now go on now!

28:05.629 --> 28:06.672
Where you from, Ray?

28:06.755 --> 28:07.965
North Florida.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.884
Oh, North Florida boy.

28:10.426 --> 28:11.594
Your people still down there?

28:11.719 --> 28:12.887
No.

28:14.096 --> 28:15.222
All right.

28:15.723 --> 28:17.224
Hey, uh, pardon me for askin',

28:17.308 --> 28:19.226
but how do you
get around so good ...

28:19.310 --> 28:21.186
without a cane or a dog?

28:21.979 --> 28:24.857
How do you get around so good
without a cane or dog?

28:25.482 --> 28:27.067
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

28:29.153 --> 28:31.238
My ears got to be my eyes, man.
Its ...

28:32.031 --> 28:33.282
Everything sounds different.

28:33.365 --> 28:35.451
You know that's why
I wear hard-soled shoes,

28:35.492 --> 28:37.494
so I can hear my footsteps
echo off the wall.

28:37.578 --> 28:40.789
So when I pass by an open
doorway, the sound changes.

28:40.915 --> 28:42.333
Wow. That's cool.

28:42.791 --> 28:46.378
You know you got to learn pretty quick
if you want to get around on your own.

28:46.462 --> 28:47.588
Yeah.

28:48.214 --> 28:50.466
You know, during the war,
there was a whole lot ...

28:50.549 --> 28:52.760
I had to learn fast,
or I wouldn't be here.

28:55.346 --> 28:57.723
Seein' that much death
ain't natural.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.936
Yeah, seein' death ain't natural.

29:06.398 --> 29:08.400
Boys, get from 'round that still.

29:08.484 --> 29:09.860
Y'all know better than that.

29:09.944 --> 29:11.362
Come on, catch me.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.911
Stay from 'round this fire
and get clean.

29:18.994 --> 29:20.579
Dinner will be ready soon.

29:20.663 --> 29:22.122
Hear me, Ray?

29:23.916 --> 29:25.167
I got you. I got you.

29:25.251 --> 29:26.627
No, you didn't. You missed me.

29:26.710 --> 29:28.003
Stop cheatin', Ray.

29:28.045 --> 29:30.673
Okay, you got me.

29:30.756 --> 29:32.508
But I got you back.

29:32.550 --> 29:34.301
I'm not playin' no more.

29:34.552 --> 29:35.719

29:37.429 --> 29:39.807
Come on, Ray.
Let's go swimmin'.

29:41.976 --> 29:44.478
Let's go swim in Mama's washtub.

29:45.521 --> 29:47.648
Ray, come on, Ray, play with me.

29:47.898 --> 29:50.025
You better get down
before Mama sees you.

29:50.067 --> 29:51.569
I'm a giant!

29:55.698 --> 29:57.157
Some giant.

29:58.242 --> 30:01.036
Come on, George.
I ain't playin' this game.

30:02.079 --> 30:03.581
That ain't funny.

30:05.541 --> 30:08.210
Boys, I got some field peas
and rice cooking.

30:08.252 --> 30:10.880
And there's that smothered
corn left from yesterday.

30:10.921 --> 30:14.925
And if you're real good, I might
have two pieces of peach cobbler.

30:15.676 --> 30:18.387
Ray, didn't I tell you
to get in this house?

30:21.765 --> 30:23.392
Dear God, no!

30:28.105 --> 30:29.315
That's Aretha's boy!

30:29.440 --> 30:30.774
Breathe, baby, breathe.

30:30.858 --> 30:34.236
Just breathe, baby, breathe.
Let it out!

30:34.320 --> 30:36.113
Let it out, please!

30:36.280 --> 30:37.615
Breathe for your mama, now.

30:37.698 --> 30:39.033
Come on, George.

30:39.283 --> 30:41.410
Why didn't you do somethin'?

30:41.911 --> 30:43.329
Why didn't you call me?

30:44.914 --> 30:46.582
Help us, Lord!

30:46.624 --> 30:48.250
The Lord done took him home.

30:57.885 --> 30:59.094
All right.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.931
Food and piss stop. Open it up.

31:05.267 --> 31:07.937
The food is hot.
You've got 45 minutes.

31:08.395 --> 31:10.397
- I could eat a horse.
- Where's it?

31:10.564 --> 31:12.566
Follow your nose. Right over there.

31:13.317 --> 31:14.443
Wilbur.

31:14.485 --> 31:15.569
What?

31:15.653 --> 31:17.947
45 minutes ain't enough time.

31:17.988 --> 31:19.490
We need more than that, Jack.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.158
Not to eat, you don't.

31:21.242 --> 31:23.327
Now if you got other business,
you better choose,

31:23.410 --> 31:24.912
because this bus
is rollin' on time.

31:24.995 --> 31:28.249

a washroom in the back.

31:28.582 --> 31:31.126
And you, you can smell it.

31:32.836 --> 31:33.837
Jeff.

31:33.921 --> 31:34.922
Yes, sir?

31:35.005 --> 31:36.257
Uh, could you help me in there?

31:36.340 --> 31:37.716
Sure thing, Ray.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.801
Hey, Mercedes.

31:38.884 --> 31:41.679
Hey, baby. I hope you wiped
your feet before you came in here.

31:41.762 --> 31:43.180
- There you go. Come on.
- Take that.

31:43.264 --> 31:45.140
The bathroom's right there
in front of you.

31:45.182 --> 31:46.183
Okay.

31:46.225 --> 31:47.476
You want me to fix you a plate?

31:47.560 --> 31:48.852
Uh, no, I'm ... I'm fine.

31:49.186 --> 31:50.312
All right.

31:50.396 --> 31:52.273
Sweet potato pie it is.

31:53.691 --> 31:54.817
Whoo, let's go, man.

31:54.900 --> 31:56.652
That was a long bus ride,
wasn't it?

31:56.735 --> 31:57.820
Oh, come on, man.

31:57.903 --> 32:00.990
Hey, man!
The can's down the hall.

32:01.073 --> 32:02.950
I know where the can is.
What y'all doing?

32:03.033 --> 32:04.660
Do yourself a favor and leave.

32:04.702 --> 32:06.579
I'll leave when
I'm gettin' ready to leave.

32:06.662 --> 32:08.163
Come on, Fathead, I want in.

32:08.247 --> 32:09.957

32:10.082 --> 32:12.042
And we ain't snorting no bitch.

32:12.084 --> 32:13.335

32:13.377 --> 32:15.880

null and void.

32:15.921 --> 32:17.506
So get on out of here, man.

32:17.590 --> 32:19.425
Null and void, just like my life.

32:19.508 --> 32:21.135
I'll be right at home.

32:21.218 --> 32:22.887
Look, I ain't gonna
wait all night.

32:23.012 --> 32:24.680

32:26.724 --> 32:28.767
Ray, let's go get
something to eat.

32:28.851 --> 32:30.436
I'll leave when I get a taste.

32:30.519 --> 32:31.687
Ray, what you gonna do, man?

32:31.770 --> 32:33.189
This train's pullin' out, brother.

32:33.272 --> 32:35.107
I ain't having nothin'
to do with this.

32:35.191 --> 32:36.859
- I warned you, Ray.
- Come on, man.

32:36.942 --> 32:38.152

32:38.235 --> 32:39.486

32:39.570 --> 32:41.071
I'm gonna take you
on a little ride.

32:41.155 --> 32:43.824
It'll cost you, though.
You got some cash?

32:43.908 --> 32:45.326
Will this do?

32:46.076 --> 32:47.077
That'll do.

38:53.944 --> 38:55.613
All right, who's next?

38:56.614 --> 38:58.032
It's a shame, Jimmy.

38:58.115 --> 39:00.075
You're just gonna
piss this right up your arm.

39:00.159 --> 39:02.703
You don't tell me
what to do with my money.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.749
All right, come on. Step up.
The $1 sensation.

39:11.962 --> 39:13.756
You wanna keep counting?

39:13.839 --> 39:15.591
What's the matter with you, boy?

39:15.633 --> 39:17.051
$50 ain't good enough for you?

39:17.134 --> 39:19.220
That ain't $50. Keep counting.

39:19.803 --> 39:23.098
I guess you want charity, since
that record of yours ain't selling.

39:26.185 --> 39:27.645
Get him off my back!

39:32.483 --> 39:34.109
Break it up!

39:34.276 --> 39:35.945
What the hell's going on in here?

39:36.487 --> 39:39.323
The blind sensation don't like
the money I'm trying to pay him!

39:39.406 --> 39:40.449
He's cheating me! I quit!

39:40.533 --> 39:42.201
Oh, you lying son of a bitch!

39:42.493 --> 39:44.620
Don't be fighting nobody
that can see!

39:44.662 --> 39:47.414
Listen, I ain't runnnin' around
lookin' for singles for this chump!

39:47.498 --> 39:48.582
There's $50 here, Ray.

39:48.666 --> 39:49.625
You see that, fool?

39:49.708 --> 39:52.545
Shut up, Wilbur! Ray, from now on,
I'll handle your pay myself.

39:52.628 --> 39:53.587
I'm tired of this!

39:53.671 --> 39:55.422
I'll tell Jack to
find you somebody else!

39:55.506 --> 39:56.715
You sure? It's cold out there.

39:56.799 --> 39:58.801
Don't worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

39:58.884 --> 40:01.053
- Ray!
- Damn it, Wilbur!

40:01.136 --> 40:02.137
Let him go!

40:02.221 --> 40:03.722
What we gonna do now?

40:11.522 --> 40:15.234
"After the death of Moses, the
Lord spake unto Joshua saying:

40:15.317 --> 40:17.695
Moses my servant is dead.

40:17.778 --> 40:20.239
Now therefore arise.
Go over to Jordan.

40:20.322 --> 40:21.448
Be not afraid,

40:21.532 --> 40:23.617
For the Lord thy God is with thee."

40:23.701 --> 40:25.160
Mr. Charles.

40:25.661 --> 40:26.996
Who is it?

40:27.121 --> 40:28.789
Mr. Charles,
my name is Ahmet Ertegun.

40:28.873 --> 40:30.457
May I have a moment of your time?

40:34.211 --> 40:36.088
What do you want, man?
I'm at church.

40:36.171 --> 40:38.465
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

40:38.591 --> 40:40.634
You're here now. What do you want?

40:41.927 --> 40:44.054
My company, Atlantic Records,
has acquired ...

40:44.138 --> 40:46.307
your contract from Swing Time.

40:46.807 --> 40:48.517
I'd like to discuss your future.

40:48.601 --> 40:51.437
Hold on. Don't jive me now.
I ain't for sale.

40:51.687 --> 40:53.147
May I sit down?

40:55.816 --> 40:57.776
You see, Mr. Charles,

40:58.485 --> 41:00.613
Jack Lauderdale has found himself,

41:00.738 --> 41:02.865
shall we say, a little overextended,

41:03.324 --> 41:06.118
and has had to
unload some of his talent.

41:06.202 --> 41:08.162
When your name
came up, I jumped at ...

41:08.245 --> 41:10.164
the chance to work with you.
I'm a big fan.

41:10.247 --> 41:12.124
What if I want to go
to another company?

41:12.208 --> 41:14.627
There's a guy out there right now
that is willing to pay me ...

41:14.710 --> 41:17.046
seven cents a record.
Can you do that?

41:17.421 --> 41:20.216
Man, I could promise you
15 cents a record,

41:21.091 --> 41:24.511
but you won't get it any more
than he'll pay you seven.

41:26.263 --> 41:29.391
What I will do is promise you
five cents a record ...

41:29.600 --> 41:31.894
and pay you five cents
a record.

41:32.645 --> 41:35.898
If you think pennies,
Mr. Charles, you get pennies.

41:36.774 --> 41:38.526
You think dollars,

41:39.527 --> 41:41.111
you get dollars.

41:43.113 --> 41:45.866
I like how you put
things together, man.

41:46.367 --> 41:47.868
Ahem, you know what?

41:48.369 --> 41:50.871
Omelet, you're all right with me.

41:51.288 --> 41:52.498
- Ahmet.
- Ahmet.

41:52.581 --> 41:53.749
What kind of name is that?

41:53.791 --> 41:55.042
I'm Turkish.

41:55.125 --> 41:56.335
Well, you know what?

41:56.418 --> 41:59.296
I guess Jack Lauderdale's bad
luck is my good fortune.

41:59.463 --> 42:02.508
I knew that Atlantic Records
was bigger than Swing Time.

42:02.591 --> 42:05.135
You guys do good music.
I dig Atlantic.

42:05.219 --> 42:06.679
You could have fooled me.

42:06.762 --> 42:09.431
Well, you know, I gotta keep
my eye on you city boys.

42:10.015 --> 42:11.851
Down home,
we call it "country dumb."

43:21.545 --> 43:22.838
Then give it to me right.

43:22.922 --> 43:26.342
I signed you because I sensed
something special in you ...

43:26.383 --> 43:29.595
not because you sound like
Nat Cole or Charles Brown.

43:29.678 --> 43:31.513
I thought you like what I do.

Ahmet, this is what I do, man.

43:41.232 --> 43:43.359
I gotta make a living.
This is what the people want.

43:43.442 --> 43:45.027
I don't know no other way.

43:45.110 --> 43:46.862

43:46.904 --> 43:49.240
Look, let's try a little
change of pace, okay?

43:49.323 --> 43:50.699
You're familiar with stride piano?

43:50.783 --> 43:54.078
You kidding me, man? The man who I
learned the piano from is a stride player.

43:54.161 --> 43:57.164
Okay, I got a song.
It's called "The Mess Around".

43:57.248 --> 43:59.083
"The Mess Around."
Cute title. Who wrote it?

43:59.166 --> 44:00.543
I did.

44:00.793 --> 44:02.211
Ah, you wrote it.

44:02.294 --> 44:03.295
Yeah.

I can read the lyrics.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.886

45:33.010 --> 45:34.053
Great, Ray!

45:34.136 --> 45:35.262
Unbelievable!

45:35.346 --> 45:36.430
Who's that?

45:37.431 --> 45:39.642
Ray, I want you to meet
my new partner, Jerry.

45:39.725 --> 45:41.268
Mr. Ray Charles, Jerry Wexler.

45:41.352 --> 45:42.353
Hey.

45:42.436 --> 45:45.481
Don't worry, Ray. I'm going to
step back, I'm gonna watch,

45:45.564 --> 45:47.983
I'm gonna learn how to produce
a record. I'm in awe.

45:48.025 --> 45:49.276
That was out of sight.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.153
That's some running
and riffing, man!

45:51.445 --> 45:53.155
Well, this'll make you shout, man.

46:01.247 --> 46:03.999
We're listening to that
new recording, Mess Around ...

46:04.083 --> 46:06.377
by Atlantic recording artist,
Ray Charles.

46:06.460 --> 46:09.964
And we have the gentleman
live here in the KCOH studios.

46:10.047 --> 46:13.092
So, Ray, when you're not making your
own music, what do you listen to?

46:13.175 --> 46:16.845
You know what, the fact is, King Bee,
I really and truly love gospel.

46:16.887 --> 46:19.807
One of my favorite groups
is from right here in Houston:

46:19.890 --> 46:21.725
The Cecil Shaw Singers.

46:21.934 --> 46:25.479
You heard it: Ray Charles endorses
Houston's own Cecil Shaw.

46:25.563 --> 46:27.481
We'll be playing
gospel all day Sunday ...

46:27.565 --> 46:29.233
but right now,
let's hear some more ...

46:29.316 --> 46:30.943
of that Mess Around
by Ray Charles.

46:31.026 --> 46:32.361
K.B., line 1.

46:34.738 --> 46:36.073
King Bee.

46:37.783 --> 46:38.784
Mmm-hmm.

46:39.785 --> 46:41.453
Yeah, he's right here.

46:42.079 --> 46:44.665
Miss Della Antwine
of the Cecil Shaw Singers.

46:48.127 --> 46:49.962
Hello, Miss Antwine.

46:50.379 --> 46:53.132
You sung tenor in
Jesus Is My Shepherd, right?

46:53.215 --> 46:54.425
Yes.

46:55.259 --> 46:57.011
How did you pick me out?

46:57.094 --> 47:00.055
Actually,
I ... I hear like you see.

47:00.806 --> 47:03.851
Like that hummingbird outside
the window, for instance.

47:10.065 --> 47:11.317
I can't hear her.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.651
You have to listen.

47:30.711 --> 47:31.754
Yes.

47:31.837 --> 47:32.838
Yeah.

47:33.130 --> 47:34.256
Yes, you can.

47:34.340 --> 47:35.382
OH-OH.

47:35.466 --> 47:36.425
You hear that?

47:36.508 --> 47:37.551
What?

47:38.302 --> 47:40.429
Her heart just skipped a beat.

47:42.681 --> 47:44.558
Oh, did you like my record?

47:44.850 --> 47:47.228
The one that King Bee was playin'?

47:48.646 --> 47:50.272
It was very nice.

47:50.523 --> 47:52.733
Different than the others.

47:53.317 --> 47:55.236
I've heard a lot of your music.

47:55.319 --> 47:56.862
Was it very nice, too?

47:56.946 --> 47:59.198
Look, Miss Antwine, if you
don't really like the record,

47:59.281 --> 48:02.660
you ain't got to beat around the bush
with me. I mean, my mama never did.

48:02.743 --> 48:05.037
It's not that I don't
enjoy your music.

48:05.120 --> 48:07.456
It's just that I feel
I've heard it before.

48:07.498 --> 48:10.042
I keep wondering what the
real Ray Charles sound like.

48:10.125 --> 48:11.585
Ray Charles? Who's he?

48:11.669 --> 48:13.587
Nobody, if you don't know.

48:13.671 --> 48:14.630
Huh?

48:15.464 --> 48:17.925
Sorry. I should have
kept my mouth shut.

48:18.008 --> 48:20.177
Oh, no, no.
Then you wouldn't be you.

48:21.387 --> 48:23.806
You know, it's not like
I haven't heard that before.

48:23.848 --> 48:27.184
I guess I just, uh, never
really listened, that's all.

48:29.395 --> 48:32.356
Ain't nobody ever put
it that sweet, I guess.

48:49.582 --> 48:51.500
You know what,
Miss Della Bea Antwine?

48:51.542 --> 48:53.669
You really are a country girl.
You know that?

48:53.752 --> 48:55.713
Yes.
How'd you know?

48:55.796 --> 48:57.840
I could tell by
the way you ordered.

48:57.923 --> 49:00.092
"Let me get molasses
with my cornbread."

49:01.343 --> 49:03.012
Were you raised on a farm?

49:03.095 --> 49:05.931
My mother did a little
sharecropping in Florida.

49:06.015 --> 49:07.474
Is she still there?

49:07.558 --> 49:10.394
God bless her heart, she passed
away when I went to school.

49:10.477 --> 49:11.979
Ray, I'm sorry.

49:12.438 --> 49:14.148
She never was real healthy.

49:14.231 --> 49:16.775
She just worked herself
to death, poor thing.

49:16.901 --> 49:19.653
That's why she didn't want me
carrying around no tin cup.

49:19.737 --> 49:21.447
The kids I went to school with,

49:21.530 --> 49:24.200
they were doing basket-weavin'
and wickerwork.

49:25.075 --> 49:27.369
But not you. Because of your gift.

49:27.494 --> 49:29.121
Because of my ears.

49:29.413 --> 49:31.332
See, I can mimic
damn near anybody,

49:31.415 --> 49:34.084
and I ... I ... I ... I make
a pretty decent living at it.

49:34.168 --> 49:36.212
It's just, if I
change my style up ...

49:36.295 --> 49:37.838
and people really don't dig it,

49:37.922 --> 49:40.174
I mean, what am I
left with, you know?

49:40.424 --> 49:42.760
I mean, when you're blind,
Miss Antwine,

49:42.927 --> 49:45.012
you ain't got that many choices.

49:46.263 --> 49:48.724
Seem to me like you got all
the choices in the world.

49:49.934 --> 49:51.727
God gave you the gift to sound ...

49:51.769 --> 49:54.063
like anybody you please,
even yourself.

49:55.814 --> 49:58.025
We're here. This is where I live.

49:59.151 --> 50:00.986
Well, you think
the preacher'd let me in?

50:01.070 --> 50:03.405
I mean, uh, I'm a sinner,
but I need a little prayer.

50:03.447 --> 50:05.950
His wife don't like
me having male company.

50:06.075 --> 50:09.203
Well, tell him there's
a soul out here that needs savin'.

50:09.954 --> 50:13.374
You know what, Miss Antwine,
you really got me thinkin'.

50:15.209 --> 50:16.669
About what?

50:16.794 --> 50:20.089
About my life. About my music.

50:22.216 --> 50:23.717
About everything.

50:25.970 --> 50:29.431
Ray, don't ... don't you think
we're movin' a little fast?

50:31.392 --> 50:33.143
Listen, I'm ... I'm gonna
go to New York ...

50:33.227 --> 50:35.729
for a couple of weeks,
and when I get back,

50:36.146 --> 50:38.607
you can take it as
slow as you want.

50:41.277 --> 50:43.112
All right, Mr. Charles.

50:44.488 --> 50:46.240
All right, Miss Antwine.

50:46.657 --> 50:48.284
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

50:48.325 --> 50:50.369
Well, hold on, now.
Let me call you a cab.

50:50.452 --> 50:52.121
I got it. Three blocks up,

50:52.204 --> 50:54.915
left for two, right for one.

50:54.999 --> 50:56.709
Fifteen giant steps,

50:56.792 --> 50:58.711
and I'm at the
Crystal White Hotel. Hello.

51:05.968 --> 51:08.554
"Mess Around" was
a positive step for us, Ray.

51:08.637 --> 51:09.763
We're making progress.

51:09.847 --> 51:11.974
Oh, come on, Ahmet.
Now, you've been nice to me.

51:12.057 --> 51:13.809
But I haven't given
you guys any hits.

51:13.893 --> 51:15.436
Atlantic Records
has been good to me,

51:15.519 --> 51:17.229
but if you want me to do
something special,

51:17.313 --> 51:18.647
I'm gonna need my own band.

51:19.148 --> 51:22.359
Oh, man. Taking a band out on
the road costs a mint, Ray.

51:22.443 --> 51:25.487
I mean, even Joe Morris is struggling.
His band's had a hit record.

51:25.571 --> 51:27.406
But, Ahmet, listen,
I'm not Joe Morris.

51:27.489 --> 51:29.742
Man, you told me if I think
pennies, I get pennies.

51:29.825 --> 51:31.702
I'm thinking dollars, man.

51:33.037 --> 51:35.873
Ruth Brown's got
a tour booked in Georgia.

51:36.999 --> 51:38.209
She needs a band.

51:38.292 --> 51:39.293
I ... I'll take it.

51:39.376 --> 51:42.129
I could write the charts
for her, I ... I could do backup,

51:42.213 --> 51:44.256
and also be an openin' act.

51:47.218 --> 51:48.552
Okay.

51:48.677 --> 51:50.930
But you're going to be
financially responsible.

51:51.013 --> 51:52.932
You're gonna have
to make it work, Ray.

51:53.015 --> 51:55.518
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna make it
do what it do, baby.

51:55.601 --> 51:56.977
Yeah.

52:09.114 --> 52:10.115
Ray!

52:10.366 --> 52:12.785
Miss Antwine, it's been two weeks.

52:12.868 --> 52:14.578
It's been three.

52:20.251 --> 52:22.711
Now, where's the preacher at?
And the wife?

52:22.836 --> 52:24.922
They in Dallas till Monday.

52:25.005 --> 52:26.757
Well, hallelujah!

52:36.976 --> 52:38.394
Della Bea.

52:39.270 --> 52:41.063
Kind of like a honey bee, right?

52:44.984 --> 52:46.652
Can I call you Bea?

52:47.653 --> 52:49.947
Yeah, I'd like that.

52:52.825 --> 52:56.662
There's only been two cats that
I ever really trusted in my life.

52:58.289 --> 53:01.417
There's Jeff Brown, he's going
to be my tour manager,

53:02.293 --> 53:04.587
Fathead Newman, my tenor man ...

53:06.797 --> 53:08.257
and now you.

53:15.973 --> 53:17.349
But you gotta do me a favor.

53:17.433 --> 53:19.518
Bea, you gotta
always tell me the truth.

53:19.602 --> 53:21.729
Oh, yeah.
Just like you did before.

53:22.605 --> 53:25.566
Don't feel sorry for me
just 'cause I'm blind.

53:26.692 --> 53:29.195
How could I pity
someone I admire?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.701
Can I play something for you?

53:35.784 --> 53:37.369
- Now?
- Yeah.

53:37.453 --> 53:38.579
No, Ray.

53:38.662 --> 53:40.581
Yeah, right now.
Right now. I'm gonna ...

53:40.664 --> 53:41.790
Ray!

53:45.669 --> 53:47.546
It's right there.
You got it.

53:47.671 --> 53:48.839
Okay.

53:48.923 --> 53:50.132
Yeah, yeah, this will work.

53:51.342 --> 53:53.636
Now you go ahead and play.
I'm gonna close these drapes.

53:53.719 --> 53:54.720
All right.

55:33.110 --> 55:34.904
Ruth Brown's pregnant,
so there's no tour.

55:34.945 --> 55:36.739

55:36.864 --> 55:38.866
Get LaVern Baker to take the tour.

55:38.949 --> 55:41.118
She doesn't have a record.
There's nothing to promote.

55:41.202 --> 55:43.370
You and Jesse get up there,
write a couple of songs,

55:43.412 --> 55:44.830

We got to do somethin'.

55:48.709 --> 55:50.377
Ray's got a whole
new band up there.

55:50.419 --> 55:52.755

together a band so fast?

55:52.838 --> 55:55.257

that's my opinion.

57:08.539 --> 57:10.583
Milt Shaw, meet Ray Charles.

57:10.666 --> 57:12.501
Ray, It was
Milt's dad, Billy,

57:12.543 --> 57:15.170
who first drew my attention
to a certain blind pianist ...

57:15.212 --> 57:17.214
when he was
booking Lowell Fulson.

57:17.298 --> 57:19.717
Ray Charles.
We believe in your talent.

57:19.800 --> 57:22.386
We wanna be
in the Ray Charles business.

57:22.469 --> 57:24.889
We've already got you
booked on a 10-city tour ...

57:24.972 --> 57:26.473

57:26.515 --> 57:27.725
Oh, Roy Milton, I love him.

57:27.808 --> 57:30.686
... and Tangula,
the Exotic Shake Dancer.

57:30.895 --> 57:33.439
She is gorgeous.

57:33.564 --> 57:34.857
Ray, I gotta tell you,

57:34.940 --> 57:37.443
we think you're onto
something very big here.

57:37.526 --> 57:40.613
Nobody's ever combined
R&B and gospel before.

57:40.696 --> 57:42.072
"I've Got A Woman" is a smash.

57:42.156 --> 57:44.992
You better start thinking about a
follow-up, my friend. Right now.

57:45.075 --> 57:47.203
You know, this sounds good.
I gotta run to Texas ...

57:47.286 --> 57:49.872
and take care of some business,
and, I'll be right back.

57:49.955 --> 57:52.541
Well, make it fast.
I'm ready to sell, sell, sell.

57:52.625 --> 57:55.878

me in front of Tangula.

59:03.988 --> 59:05.197
You know the place is small.

59:05.281 --> 59:06.657
We gotta have a little privacy.

01:00:27.863 --> 01:00:29.532
This ain't right!

01:00:29.698 --> 01:00:32.076
Just let the people
hear the music.

01:00:32.409 --> 01:00:35.329
Y'all sitting here,
listenin' to this devil!

01:00:35.412 --> 01:00:38.541
You're just givin' your money
to Satan, that's what you're doin'.

01:00:38.624 --> 01:00:40.584
Hold on, y — you got a problem?

01:00:40.668 --> 01:00:42.253
Yeah, I got a problem!

01:00:42.336 --> 01:00:44.171
That's gospel you're singin'!

01:00:44.255 --> 01:00:46.340
You're turning
God's music into sex.

01:00:46.423 --> 01:00:48.425
You're making money off the Lord!

01:00:48.509 --> 01:00:51.345
Don't y'all smile at me!
All of y'all are in it, too!

01:00:51.428 --> 01:00:53.472
All of y'all are
going straight to hell!

01:00:53.556 --> 01:00:54.557
She's right.

01:00:56.267 --> 01:00:57.434
No, this here's wrong.

01:00:57.518 --> 01:00:58.727
The whole thing's wrong.

01:00:59.895 --> 01:01:01.730
It's okay. It's okay.
Let ... let him go.

01:01:02.898 --> 01:01:04.692
You got a right to believe
in what you believe.

01:01:04.733 --> 01:01:06.902
You can go
to hell by yourself!

01:01:06.986 --> 01:01:08.529
Boss, you want
to cancel the show?

01:01:08.612 --> 01:01:09.947
Uh, no. I'm not gonna
cancel the show.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.574
Just find me
a bari player by tomorrow.

01:01:11.657 --> 01:01:14.034
I just want to ask
the folks right now:

01:01:14.076 --> 01:01:17.079
If all of y'all want me to keep
playing, let me hear you say "Amen."

01:01:17.162 --> 01:01:19.164
Amen!

01:01:19.248 --> 01:01:21.041
And while you're at it,
find me a girl ...

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:22.668
with church-training
that can sing ...

01:01:22.751 --> 01:01:23.919
but without the church attitude.

01:01:23.961 --> 01:01:25.045
All right.

01:01:25.087 --> 01:01:26.922
Let's go, y'all.
Keep it going, here we go ...

01:01:26.964 --> 01:01:28.591

01:01:47.151 --> 01:01:48.194
Yeah.

01:01:48.277 --> 01:01:51.906
Good. All right, baby,
your blue shirts are on top,

01:01:51.947 --> 01:01:55.409
the pants in between, and the
white shirts are on the bottom.

01:01:55.784 --> 01:01:58.454
Here's your glasses.
There you go.

01:02:00.122 --> 01:02:01.123
Bea.

01:02:01.624 --> 01:02:03.918
Why don't you come,
go on the road with us?

01:02:03.959 --> 01:02:06.086
Look, baby, what would
I do on the road?

01:02:06.128 --> 01:02:08.505
You'd do what I say you do,
that's what you're gonna do.

01:02:09.673 --> 01:02:13.469
I've been trying to get a female
voice in the band, anyway.

01:02:13.511 --> 01:02:16.347
Can't you just picture me
wobbling around on that stage,

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.640
big as a house?

01:02:17.723 --> 01:02:19.725
Well, I can't picture you,
you know that.

01:02:19.808 --> 01:02:21.268
But I know what I can do.

01:02:22.978 --> 01:02:25.731
Come on, now. Don't start
nothing you can't finish.

01:02:25.814 --> 01:02:27.233
Jeff is waiting.

01:02:28.692 --> 01:02:30.903
You know I can't go
on the road with you,

01:02:30.986 --> 01:02:32.446
not with your baby inside me.

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:33.572
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:33.656 --> 01:02:35.616
I'm gonna get your shaving kit.

01:02:36.617 --> 01:02:38.452
Uh, Bea,
I ... I got it.

01:02:39.078 --> 01:02:40.704
Bea, hold ... hold on.

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:46.669
Bea, let me get it.

01:02:47.711 --> 01:02:50.297
How long you been
hiding this from me?

01:02:51.715 --> 01:02:52.716
Ray!

01:02:54.176 --> 01:02:55.511
I'm your wife!

01:02:55.594 --> 01:02:57.471
Bea, I ... I was just so
excited to see you.

01:02:57.555 --> 01:02:59.849
I forgot to leave it back there
with the band, that's all.

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:01.225
Let me ... Let me get it.

01:03:01.308 --> 01:03:03.519
Oh, it's just a little medicine,
that's all, baby.

01:03:03.602 --> 01:03:05.020
That ain't medicine to nobody, Ray.

01:03:05.104 --> 01:03:06.480
Don't be lyin' to yourself.

01:03:06.564 --> 01:03:08.148
It ain't like I'm
dealing it, baby.

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:09.692
I just use it
to get a little taste.

01:03:09.775 --> 01:03:11.527
You don't taste poison, Ray.
It kills you.

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:12.653
Now, you got to stop.

01:03:12.736 --> 01:03:14.864
I ain't got to do
a goddamn thing!

01:03:16.448 --> 01:03:19.076
What about me?
What about your baby?

01:03:19.743 --> 01:03:20.744
Bea.

01:03:21.036 --> 01:03:23.205
It ain't like I'm new to this.

01:03:23.747 --> 01:03:26.417
If I felt like this was
jeopardizing my music, or you,

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.877
or providing for that baby,

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.087
I would stop in a minute.
But I know it won't.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:32.673
How do you know that, Ray?
How do ... How do you know that?

01:03:32.756 --> 01:03:35.217
You know what? You can talk till
you're blue in the face,

01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:36.969
it don't matter.
I'm not gonna stop.

01:03:37.052 --> 01:03:38.012
Then I'm comin' with you.

01:03:38.095 --> 01:03:39.013
No, no.

01:03:39.054 --> 01:03:40.139
Well, Ray, you just said ...

01:03:40.222 --> 01:03:41.849
No. No.
You know what it is, Bea.

01:03:41.891 --> 01:03:43.809
I ... I think
it's like you said.

01:03:44.226 --> 01:03:47.563
I don't think that the road
is a place for you and the baby.

01:03:50.149 --> 01:03:51.984
What are you saying to me, Ray?

01:03:52.067 --> 01:03:54.236
What I'm sayin' is
that when I get home,

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.655
I hope that you're
here at my house.

01:03:58.407 --> 01:03:59.742
Your house?

01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:06.123
Jeff, come get this bag.

01:04:06.207 --> 01:04:07.708

01:08:10.326 --> 01:08:11.660
No, I can't.

01:08:11.702 --> 01:08:12.703
Come on, Ray.

01:08:12.786 --> 01:08:14.288
I wouldn't know
what to do it right.

01:08:14.371 --> 01:08:15.998
That's what you came here for.

01:08:16.081 --> 01:08:18.334
Use this hand to hold his head.

01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:21.252
Okay. Right there.

01:08:31.388 --> 01:08:33.057
That's your daddy.

01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:34.350

01:08:36.185 --> 01:08:39.063

than a loaf of bread.

01:08:39.772 --> 01:08:41.064
Thank you.

01:08:41.857 --> 01:08:44.026
He's not my gift to you, Ray.

01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:45.736
He's your son.

01:08:46.946 --> 01:08:49.657
You know I'm gonna take care of
both of you. You know that, right?

01:08:52.201 --> 01:08:53.702

something I got to say.

I know you're a musician,
a working musician,

01:09:02.377 --> 01:09:05.005
but don't bring the road
into our home again.

01:09:05.089 --> 01:09:07.841

for you and our children.

01:09:07.883 --> 01:09:10.135
Bea, I ... I promise
I won't do that.

01:09:10.386 --> 01:09:11.886
It ... It's just there's
some things ...

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:14.014
No. Now, don't say no more.

01:11:55.885 --> 01:11:57.887
Yeah, yes, I am.

01:12:01.223 --> 01:12:02.892

You gotta have more discipline.

You know what, man? I ain't
messing up my high tonight,

01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:39.167
sitting here with you,
arguing about nothin'.

01:22:41.085 --> 01:22:44.130
Look, Fathead, just tie me off.

01:22:45.089 --> 01:22:46.466
Come on, Fathead. Fat.

01:22:47.759 --> 01:22:51.095
Take care of your bad self,
you know so damn much.

01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:53.598

01:22:54.015 --> 01:22:55.767
Bye, Fathead.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.813
Damn.

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.487
Ain't nothing free
in this world but Jesus.

01:23:13.785 --> 01:23:14.786
Hey, Margie.

01:23:14.869 --> 01:23:17.038
Yeah? What do you want?

01:23:17.455 --> 01:23:20.125
Do me a favor, sweetheart,
and ... and pick that up for me.

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:22.919
You're going to have to get me off.

01:23:25.421 --> 01:23:27.257
I'll do it,
if you let me try some.

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.424
Shit. No, honey.

01:23:28.508 --> 01:23:30.176
This ain't for no little girls.

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.220
I ain't no little girl!

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.514
I understand.
It's just that this stuff ...

01:23:34.597 --> 01:23:37.642
will take you places
that you don't want to go.

01:23:38.017 --> 01:23:39.561
See, I want to share
that with you.

01:23:39.644 --> 01:23:41.020

believe in Jesus!

01:23:48.403 --> 01:23:50.363

Ray, I watch your show

01:23:57.912 --> 01:24:00.081
And every night is new to me.

01:24:00.248 --> 01:24:02.417
Maybe because it's new to you.

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:06.379
It's like you live
every single word ...

01:24:06.754 --> 01:24:09.716

bend some crazy note,

01:24:11.259 --> 01:24:13.511

don't break my heart.

ATLANTIC is expiring in four months.

01:37:47.075 --> 01:37:49.035
Yeah, I've got the contract with me.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.079

Before we jump back in that pond,

01:37:53.248 --> 01:37:55.416
I thought I'd find out
what else was out there.

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:59.129
I had a very productive chat
with ABC-Paramount yesterday.

01:37:59.254 --> 01:38:01.172
ABC? Who told you to do that, huh?

01:38:01.256 --> 01:38:04.217
And you know, Atlantic is family,
just like the Shaw Agency.

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.719
Ray, my job is to get you
the best deal possible.

01:38:07.429 --> 01:38:09.389
ABC is very interested.

01:38:09.431 --> 01:38:10.473
No.

01:38:13.101 --> 01:38:14.436
How interested?

01:38:15.311 --> 01:38:20.233
How about a $50,000 advance
each year for three years?

01:38:20.275 --> 01:38:22.360
You produce your own records.

01:38:22.777 --> 01:38:25.280
They'll deduct recording costs
and give you ...

01:38:25.655 --> 01:38:27.323
75 percent.

01:38:30.994 --> 01:38:32.787
Ahmet and Jerry are
flying in tonight,

01:38:32.829 --> 01:38:37.748
so will you put them off until
I can talk things out with ABC?

01:38:39.794 --> 01:38:42.297
Well, my mama said, ain't
nothing wrong with talking.

01:38:43.423 --> 01:38:44.424
Hey, enough of the formalities.

01:38:44.507 --> 01:38:46.426
Come on, let's go back
into the office, Ray.

01:38:46.509 --> 01:38:47.552
I hope I can call you Ray.

01:38:47.635 --> 01:38:49.095
I want you to be comfortable here.

01:38:49.179 --> 01:38:52.223
Because I'll tell you something,
everything is gonna be better at ABC.

01:38:52.307 --> 01:38:54.225
Moving from an indie label
to a major ...

01:38:54.309 --> 01:38:55.935
means you can sell
a lot more records,

01:38:55.977 --> 01:38:59.272
as well as attract much larger
crowds, both white and Negro.

01:38:59.355 --> 01:39:02.942
Yeah, but Mr. Clark, you know,
I've been at Atlantic for so long,

01:39:03.485 --> 01:39:07.781
I just want to give those guys a chance,
you know, to at least match the offer.

01:39:07.822 --> 01:39:10.116
Mm-hmm. Oh, certainly, certainly.

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.701
But, uh, I doubt they'll be able to.

01:39:11.785 --> 01:39:13.745
We're giving you
a state-of-the-art deal here.

01:39:13.828 --> 01:39:17.207
Well, you know, since I'm producing my own
records, I was wondering if I could ...

01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:19.125
uh, own my masters, too.

01:39:26.674 --> 01:39:27.675
Well,

01:39:27.759 --> 01:39:29.969
Ray, we've ... we've never
done that before.

01:39:30.053 --> 01:39:32.097
No record company has.

01:39:32.222 --> 01:39:36.935
Well, I think I'm going to have to have it
that way for me to leave Atlantic Records.

01:39:45.777 --> 01:39:48.113
Ahmet believes
we're family here at Atlantic.

01:39:48.196 --> 01:39:50.240
I believe we're family
here at Atlantic.

01:39:50.323 --> 01:39:52.158
Obviously, you don't!

01:39:52.617 --> 01:39:54.160
Ahmet wouldn't believe it.

01:39:54.244 --> 01:39:55.787
You know what he said, Ray?

01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:57.831
He said you would never
turn your back on us.

01:39:57.914 --> 01:40:00.041
Never for a Schlockmeister
like Sam Clark!

01:40:01.209 --> 01:40:03.294
That's rich.
Sam Clark's a corporate slug,

01:40:03.378 --> 01:40:06.548
who wouldn't know the difference
between Earl Hines and Art Tatum!

01:40:12.887 --> 01:40:14.931
We let you grow here, Ray.

01:40:15.223 --> 01:40:18.893
And nobody's taking credit for
your talent, but we nourished it.

01:40:19.394 --> 01:40:21.354
We let you do your thing.

01:40:22.939 --> 01:40:25.150
God damn it!
We deserve better than this.

01:40:25.233 --> 01:40:27.277
You know what, don't think that
I don't appreciate ...

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.154
everything you guys
have done here, Jerry.

01:40:29.237 --> 01:40:31.865
Ahmet, I'm very proud of the work
that we've done here together.

01:40:31.906 --> 01:40:35.160
But, Atlantic has done pretty good
money-wise on my records, haven't they?

01:40:35.243 --> 01:40:36.661
Yes, we've done very well, Ray.

01:40:36.744 --> 01:40:39.956
You ... you were the ones that taught
me that making a record is business,

01:40:40.039 --> 01:40:42.375
and find the best
business deal you can.

01:40:42.459 --> 01:40:45.712
Now, 75 cents of every dollar,
and owning my own masters ...

01:40:45.795 --> 01:40:47.922
is a pretty damn good deal.

01:40:48.465 --> 01:40:50.091
Can you match it?

01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:55.180
Ray, we would love to
match it, but we just can't.

01:40:56.514 --> 01:40:59.350
That's a better deal
than Sinatra gets.

01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:03.730
I'm very proud of you.

01:41:06.232 --> 01:41:09.819
Looks like those boys are going
to get a taste of country dumb.

01:41:09.903 --> 01:41:11.070
Yeah.

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:15.325
He'll be all right, man.

01:41:16.493 --> 01:41:18.411
You guys always do find the best.

01:42:18.471 --> 01:42:19.931
They didn't.

01:42:20.598 --> 01:42:22.308
It was Ray's idea.

01:42:24.394 --> 01:42:25.437
Something new.

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:28.106
What are we then, Jeff?
Something old?

01:42:28.148 --> 01:42:31.818

Critics say you've gone
middle-of-the-road.

01:43:14.277 --> 01:43:17.363
The orchestra, the choir,
The Perry Como Show, man?

01:43:17.447 --> 01:43:20.992
If I feel the music,
that means it's real.

01:43:21.075 --> 01:43:23.703
No, it ain't.
Ray Charles is a sellout.

01:43:23.787 --> 01:43:26.790
The blind Liberace, leaving those
Rocking Chair roots behind.

01:43:26.873 --> 01:43:27.832
Quincy Jones.

01:43:27.916 --> 01:43:29.793
Can we get a picture
of these two guys?

01:43:29.876 --> 01:43:31.711
- Six-nine!
- Hey, boy.

01:43:31.795 --> 01:43:34.214
Look, here, uh,
this interview is over.

01:43:34.297 --> 01:43:36.174
I'd love to
get you two together, man.

01:43:36.216 --> 01:43:37.634
S-some other time.

01:43:37.967 --> 01:43:40.595
Look at you. How's it going, man?
You look good.

01:43:40.678 --> 01:43:42.722
Let me look at you.
You look good, too.

01:43:42.806 --> 01:43:44.474
You hear what they're
saying about me?

01:43:44.557 --> 01:43:47.644
I just said that I ... I can't do it
no more. I've gone middle-of-the-road.

01:43:47.727 --> 01:43:49.145
So crank out another hit.

01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:50.355
Let me tell you something,

01:43:50.396 --> 01:43:52.857
it ain't easy
to keep on being greezy, kid.

01:43:53.316 --> 01:43:54.734
Where you blow in from?

01:43:55.944 --> 01:43:57.028
Paris.

01:43:57.112 --> 01:43:58.238
Bonjour.

01:43:58.279 --> 01:44:00.490
Yeah, man.
France is where it's at.

01:44:00.657 --> 01:44:02.742
Yeah, man. And all that stuff
you've been playing,

01:44:02.826 --> 01:44:05.245
man, it's just ...
it really feels out of sight.

01:44:05.286 --> 01:44:07.789
You know, we gotta
record something together.

01:44:07.872 --> 01:44:09.624
I mean, people will really dig it.

01:44:09.707 --> 01:44:11.584
So, where you going
after the Festival?

01:44:11.626 --> 01:44:15.421
Oh, I ... I go to D.C., Richmond,
uh, Virginia, Georgia.

01:44:15.505 --> 01:44:18.383
You know what, once you get the
record out there, you gotta sell it.

01:44:18.425 --> 01:44:19.884
The South, man?

01:44:21.094 --> 01:44:22.387
I'm not doing that no more.

01:44:22.429 --> 01:44:25.265
Hey, come on, kid, that's where
the money is, baby.

01:44:25.348 --> 01:44:27.892
You know, When I left Seattle
with Hamp,

01:44:27.976 --> 01:44:29.185
we went down there, man.

01:44:29.269 --> 01:44:31.855
And it felt like
I walked into a prison cell.

01:44:31.938 --> 01:44:35.567
You know, a black man
is a "boy" in Mississippi, Ray.

01:44:35.650 --> 01:44:37.569
Even if he's 80 years old.

01:44:40.822 --> 01:44:43.241
I'm never playing
to Jim Crow again. Ever.

01:44:43.283 --> 01:44:45.118
If that's what you feel, baby.

01:44:45.201 --> 01:44:48.872
I'm serious, Ray.
Man, we gotta do something.

01:44:50.582 --> 01:44:52.459
Well, you know,
what ... what the hell, man.

01:44:52.542 --> 01:44:55.920
You're just going to leave a lot
more money on the table for me.

01:44:56.463 --> 01:44:58.131
You're welcome to it, man.

01:45:13.229 --> 01:45:14.773
You ready to work?

01:45:14.856 --> 01:45:16.149
Work on what?

01:45:17.358 --> 01:45:19.235
Get over here, you gotta
help me with this.

01:45:19.319 --> 01:45:20.737
Percy just sent me some new music.

01:45:34.793 --> 01:45:37.045
You know what
they're saying about me?

01:45:37.128 --> 01:45:39.547
Said I've lost something, said
I've gone middle-of-the-road.

01:45:39.631 --> 01:45:41.883
They may as well say
the same thing about you.

01:45:41.966 --> 01:45:43.301
You were the soul of this band.

01:45:43.343 --> 01:45:45.804
Now every time you're around,
you're just drunk.

01:45:47.806 --> 01:45:49.307
Drunk soul of a blind junkie.

01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:51.142
What a lovely couple.

01:45:51.226 --> 01:45:53.603
Why don't you
just get out of here?

01:45:55.438 --> 01:45:57.440
I ain't drunk, Ray.

01:45:58.358 --> 01:45:59.692
I'm pregnant.

01:46:00.902 --> 01:46:03.655
Yeah, that's right.
I'm having your baby.

01:46:03.696 --> 01:46:06.533
You ain't really ...
You ... you can't do that.

01:46:06.991 --> 01:46:08.660
I'm gonna have to
talk to the doctor.

01:46:08.701 --> 01:46:09.869
You gotta get rid of it.

01:46:11.287 --> 01:46:13.123
My God!

01:46:13.248 --> 01:46:15.416
What, because
I'm not your precious Bea?

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.211
I'm not good enough
to have this baby?

01:46:19.379 --> 01:46:21.965
You lay up
in my bed every night.

01:46:22.048 --> 01:46:23.258
My bed!

01:46:24.384 --> 01:46:26.052
I'm gonna have this baby, Ray.

01:46:29.264 --> 01:46:31.641
- No, Ray! No!
- Come on, come on. Come on, just listen.

01:46:31.724 --> 01:46:32.684
Just listen to me.

01:46:32.767 --> 01:46:34.102
You know
I care about you, baby.

01:46:34.185 --> 01:46:36.521
I won't let nothing happen to you.
I'll pay for everything.

01:46:36.563 --> 01:46:37.647
No!

01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:39.899
It's gonna cost you
more than money.

01:46:39.941 --> 01:46:42.944
I want you to leave her, Ray.
Come and be with our baby.

01:46:43.027 --> 01:46:46.531
You out of your damn mind. You knew
the rules when you got into this.

01:46:46.573 --> 01:46:48.950
You know goddamn well I ain't
gonna leave my family.

01:46:50.368 --> 01:46:52.036
Leave your family?

01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:54.873
You are a damn fool,
you know that?

01:46:55.623 --> 01:46:58.960
Between the dope
and the music and me,

01:46:59.043 --> 01:47:01.713
you already done left
your damn family!

01:47:02.213 --> 01:47:06.092
You know what the sad part about
it is, Ray, you don't even know it.

01:47:11.014 --> 01:47:12.515
You know what?

01:47:12.599 --> 01:47:16.102
From now on, it's strictly
business between you and me.

01:47:19.147 --> 01:47:21.900
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Keep that anger.

Can you hear me? It's Sam!

01:48:27.173 --> 01:48:29.801
Yeah, hey, Hit the Road
is our second number one.

01:48:29.843 --> 01:48:33.012
Yeah. ABC is taking out ads
in all the trades.

01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:35.932
Yeah, oh, and congrats
on your Grammy nomination.

01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:39.060
No, no, no I know
you're going to win.

01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:41.479
Hey, you feeling all right?

01:48:41.938 --> 01:48:44.524
Well, come on, baby, be happy.
You're doing good.

01:48:44.774 --> 01:48:45.859
Thank you, Sam.

01:48:47.068 --> 01:48:48.862
I really am happy about that.

01:48:49.404 --> 01:48:50.947
Yeah.

01:48:54.534 --> 01:48:57.912
I'll stop by Jeff's room
and get my money on my way out.

01:49:04.919 --> 01:49:05.920
Ray.

01:49:07.672 --> 01:49:09.549
Margie, you ain't gotta leave, baby.

01:49:09.716 --> 01:49:11.676
I'm on your hit record.

01:49:11.843 --> 01:49:14.679
If I'm ever going to go solo,
then now's the time.

01:49:14.721 --> 01:49:16.556
Yeah, I ... I don't want you ...

01:49:16.681 --> 01:49:18.475
I don't want you to go solo.

01:49:18.558 --> 01:49:21.019
Ray, for once,
I'm doing something for me.

01:49:22.061 --> 01:49:24.522
You remember the hummingbird,
right?

01:49:25.315 --> 01:49:26.316
What?

01:49:26.983 --> 01:49:28.735
The hummingbird, Bea.

01:49:41.664 --> 01:49:43.833
And I don't want you to go.

01:49:57.138 --> 01:49:58.598
Somebody will fetch you ...

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.183
when your bus gets to St. Augustine.

01:50:00.266 --> 01:50:02.393
And when you get there,
show them this sign,

01:50:02.477 --> 01:50:04.813
and tell them you're name is
Ray Charles Robinson.

01:50:05.772 --> 01:50:08.691
And them sandwiches I made, don't
eat 'em all at once. You hear?

01:50:08.775 --> 01:50:10.985
Oh, please, don't make me go away.

01:50:11.069 --> 01:50:12.695
I'll keep up with the normal kids.

01:50:12.779 --> 01:50:14.739
I'll be good, just like George.

01:50:14.823 --> 01:50:16.783
This ain't got nothing
to do with George.

01:50:16.866 --> 01:50:19.327
I've taken you
as far as I can, baby.

01:50:19.494 --> 01:50:22.747
Them teachers at that blind school,
they can teach you things I can't.

01:50:22.789 --> 01:50:24.541
And you need an education
in this world.

01:50:24.624 --> 01:50:25.792
I don't want no education!

01:50:25.875 --> 01:50:26.876
Don't say that!

01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.878
I don't! I want to stay with you!

01:50:28.962 --> 01:50:29.963
Stop it, Ray!

01:50:30.046 --> 01:50:32.715
I won't have you living
hand-to-mouth like me, you hear?

01:50:33.591 --> 01:50:37.011
Now listen, if you want to do
something to make your mama proud,

01:50:37.303 --> 01:50:41.099
promise me, promise me you'll never
let nobody turn you into no cripple.

01:50:41.182 --> 01:50:42.892
You won't become no charity case.

01:50:42.976 --> 01:50:44.894
You'll stand on your own two feet.

01:50:44.978 --> 01:50:46.312
I promise.

01:50:46.646 --> 01:50:48.106
I love you, baby.

01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:50.608
I'm so proud of you.

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:06.749
No more segregation!

01:51:06.833 --> 01:51:09.836
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:09.919 --> 01:51:13.006
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:16.968 --> 01:51:19.763
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:19.846 --> 01:51:22.849
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:22.932 --> 01:51:25.977
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:26.019 --> 01:51:27.812
Welcome back to Augusta, Ray!

01:51:27.854 --> 01:51:29.606
Hey, good to see you.

01:51:29.898 --> 01:51:32.859
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:32.901 --> 01:51:34.694
Do you believe
in the protest, Ray?

01:51:35.028 --> 01:51:36.404
Get out of here!

01:51:36.488 --> 01:51:39.032
Ray, I'm sorry about this.
Hurry on up inside.

01:51:39.115 --> 01:51:40.867
We got refreshments waiting.

01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:42.577
Mr. Charles!
Mr. Charles!

01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.370
You know tonight's show
is segregated?

01:51:44.454 --> 01:51:46.080
The dance floor is whites only.

01:51:46.164 --> 01:51:47.582
Negroes can't leave the balcony.

01:51:47.665 --> 01:51:49.751
That's how it is, man.
You know, this is Georgia.

01:51:49.834 --> 01:51:51.127
You think we don't know that?

01:51:51.211 --> 01:51:53.546
Negroes are persecuted
in this state every day!

01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:55.548
Ain't nothing I can do about that.

01:51:55.632 --> 01:51:58.718
I'm an entertainer. And ... and we
all gotta play Jim Crow down here.

01:51:58.802 --> 01:52:00.553
I'm sorry, man.
Now get out of here, boy.

01:52:00.637 --> 01:52:01.971
It doesn't have to be that way.

01:52:02.055 --> 01:52:04.307
You could change things,
right here and now!

01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:06.017
I'm sorry, son.
Ain't nothing I can do.

01:52:06.059 --> 01:52:08.103
You hear that, boy?
That's the way things are.

01:52:08.186 --> 01:52:09.813
Ain't nothing
or nobody can change it.

01:52:09.896 --> 01:52:12.732
Now get your black ass out of here,
and take that trash with you!

01:52:12.774 --> 01:52:16.069
Hold on ... hold on. He ...
he's right. He's right, Jeff.

01:52:16.152 --> 01:52:17.195
Get them on the bus.

01:52:17.278 --> 01:52:18.279
You sure?

01:52:18.363 --> 01:52:19.572
Get them back on the bus!

01:52:19.656 --> 01:52:21.282
Y'all heard him! Y'all heard Ray!

01:52:21.366 --> 01:52:23.118
Back on the bus!

01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:24.994
Are you serious?

01:52:26.246 --> 01:52:27.372
Get them on the bus.

01:52:27.413 --> 01:52:28.915
I can't do nothing here.

01:52:28.957 --> 01:52:30.250
Ray, you know me.

01:52:30.333 --> 01:52:33.711
I'm not gonna lose money just
because you suddenly got religion.

01:52:33.753 --> 01:52:34.921
Ain't nothing I can do, man.

01:52:35.004 --> 01:52:37.424
We have a contract with me.
You break it, I'll sue your ass!

01:52:37.507 --> 01:52:39.592
- I'll win, Ray!
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

01:52:39.676 --> 01:52:40.635
Look, I'll win big!

01:52:40.718 --> 01:52:41.803
Do what you gotta do.

01:52:41.886 --> 01:52:43.638
I told you, I'll own your ass, Ray!

01:52:45.432 --> 01:52:46.599
Thank you, Mr. Charles.

01:52:46.683 --> 01:52:48.059
You could be the first.

01:52:48.101 --> 01:52:49.727
No, thank you, son.
You were right.

01:52:49.811 --> 01:52:51.354
You're right.

01:52:52.981 --> 01:52:55.066
You'll never work Georgia again!

01:52:56.693 --> 01:53:00.113
He filed a lawsuit and
it's more than a fine, Ray.

01:53:00.738 --> 01:53:04.075
This guy's got juice. He can get you
barred from ever playing Georgia again.

01:53:04.909 --> 01:53:08.204
But he's willing to drop the
suit if you'll make up the gig.

01:53:08.705 --> 01:53:10.665
Not if it's segregated.

01:53:10.957 --> 01:53:11.916
Ray,

01:53:13.626 --> 01:53:16.588
I admire what you're doing, man,
but you can't afford this.

01:53:16.671 --> 01:53:18.298
Georgia is
our highest-grossing state.

01:53:18.381 --> 01:53:22.135
I'm not playing any more to Jim Crow
joints ever again, did you got that?

01:53:22.385 --> 01:53:24.053
Yeah. I got it.

01:53:24.554 --> 01:53:26.639
Jeff, get those people in here
so we can rehearse.

01:53:26.723 --> 01:53:28.224

Mr. Charles, it's Western Union!

We have a telegram for you.

01:55:12.745 --> 01:55:14.122
You have to sign for it, sir.

01:55:14.205 --> 01:55:15.206
I'm coming.

01:55:20.003 --> 01:55:23.006
Indianapolis police. Got a report
of loud music coming from here.

01:55:23.089 --> 01:55:25.216
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

01:55:26.468 --> 01:55:28.052
I'm just going to the bathroom.

01:55:28.094 --> 01:55:29.846
Handcuff this son of a bitch.

01:55:30.555 --> 01:55:33.516
Recognize this, Ray?
Heroin's a felony.

01:55:34.058 --> 01:55:36.019
It ain't like I'm dealing it, man.

01:55:36.102 --> 01:55:37.562
I'm not hurting nobody.

01:55:37.604 --> 01:55:39.522
Oh, no, you're hurting everybody.

01:55:39.731 --> 01:55:42.650
Your jungle music is
poisoning our kids' minds.

01:55:48.448 --> 01:55:49.616
I got responsibilities.

Why don't you tell that story
to these people.

01:55:51.785 --> 01:55:53.161
Bring them in!

01:55:56.122 --> 01:55:57.916
Ray! Was it a setup, Ray?

01:55:57.957 --> 01:55:59.834
How long you been on heroin?

01:55:59.918 --> 01:56:01.294
Come on, Ray.

01:56:01.336 --> 01:56:03.379

David.

01:56:46.381 --> 01:56:47.841
Uh, uh, Bea, he can stay.

01:56:47.924 --> 01:56:49.509
No. Baby, come on.

01:56:49.968 --> 01:56:51.261
- Bea?
- What?

01:56:52.929 --> 01:56:54.180
You know, since I got back ...

01:56:54.264 --> 01:56:55.890
Since you got out.

01:56:56.099 --> 01:56:57.350
Yeah.

01:56:57.725 --> 01:57:01.312
Well, since I got here, you haven't
said more than two words to me.

01:57:01.521 --> 01:57:03.481
Ray, what am I supposed to say?

01:57:03.857 --> 01:57:06.401
My words don't seem to
mean much to you anymore.

01:57:06.484 --> 01:57:07.902
Maybe they never did.

01:57:07.986 --> 01:57:10.196
Come on, Bea,
you ... you know I love you.

01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.990
Are you gonna stop then?

01:57:14.033 --> 01:57:16.119
You know what, Bea, what you
don't understand is ...

01:57:16.202 --> 01:57:18.496
there's a lot of mean-spirited
people out there.

01:57:19.706 --> 01:57:20.665
Yeah.

01:57:25.712 --> 01:57:26.838
Ray?

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:33.261
You know, I had to bring Junior
home from school today ...

01:57:33.344 --> 01:57:35.180
'cause of what
the other kids were sayin'.

01:57:35.221 --> 01:57:36.723
They got mean-ass kids
around here.

01:57:36.765 --> 01:57:38.725
I think we should move
to Beverly Hills.

01:57:38.767 --> 01:57:40.310
No, no, Ray,
we're not gonna move.

01:57:40.393 --> 01:57:42.353
'Cause it ... it's not
about where we live, Ray.

01:57:42.395 --> 01:57:44.773
It's about what you're doing
to yourself.

01:57:45.064 --> 01:57:46.691
And those boys worship you.

01:57:46.733 --> 01:57:49.152
You want them to end up
using that poison, too?

01:57:49.235 --> 01:57:50.904
Bea, that's not fair.

01:57:50.945 --> 01:57:53.615
What's not fair?
What's not fair, Ray?

01:57:53.698 --> 01:57:55.867
That ... that's a low blow.

01:57:58.244 --> 01:57:59.245
Hello?

01:58:00.747 --> 01:58:04.000
Don't jive me, Milt.
Don't jive me, man!

01:58:04.083 --> 01:58:05.210
Really?

01:58:05.543 --> 01:58:09.130
Ah, good, good, good. Tell ...
tell Sam I said thank you.

01:58:09.214 --> 01:58:11.216
All right. All right, then.

01:58:12.759 --> 01:58:13.802
Oh, yeah!

01:58:13.885 --> 01:58:16.596
What, Ray?
What? Come on, now.

01:58:16.638 --> 01:58:18.473
Ray, tell me what happened.

01:58:18.556 --> 01:58:20.767
ABC got the case dropped.

01:58:20.809 --> 01:58:22.602
The police didn't have a warrant.

01:58:22.685 --> 01:58:23.853
They bought them off.

01:58:23.937 --> 01:58:25.897
Damn it, Bea, do you
want me to go to prison?

01:58:25.939 --> 01:58:28.441
No. Ray, I want you
to stop lying to yourself,

01:58:28.483 --> 01:58:30.568
and they are making that
completely impossible.

01:58:30.652 --> 01:58:32.195
You know what,
you don't understand.

01:58:32.278 --> 01:58:33.947
Then make me understand, Ray!

01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:37.408
Baby, when I walk out that door,
I walk out alone in the dark!

01:58:37.450 --> 01:58:38.868
I'm trying to do something ...

01:58:38.952 --> 01:58:41.621
that ain't nobody ever done
in music and business.

01:58:41.704 --> 01:58:44.374
But I can't do it if I'm alone
everywhere I go.

01:58:44.958 --> 01:58:47.293
I don't want to be alone here, Bea.

01:58:47.377 --> 01:58:49.129
Not in my own home.

01:58:52.799 --> 01:58:55.427
Look, Bea,
if you don't understand me,

01:58:56.302 --> 01:58:57.846
then who will?

01:59:04.394 --> 01:59:05.979
I don't know, Ray.

01:59:09.607 --> 01:59:11.943
David? I'm coming!

01:59:13.027 --> 01:59:14.487
Mama's coming!

01:59:18.324 --> 01:59:22.245
Ray, we pull you out of the fire,
and you want country music?

01:59:22.328 --> 01:59:25.415
Look here, I've been singing
country music all my life.

01:59:25.498 --> 01:59:27.959
As a matter of fact, I used to
play with the Florida Playboys.

01:59:28.042 --> 01:59:29.544
We made a big investment in you ...

01:59:29.627 --> 01:59:31.087
and it's paying off handsomely.

01:59:31.171 --> 01:59:32.839
For both of us, I might add.

01:59:32.922 --> 01:59:34.466
We don't want to lose your fan base.

01:59:34.549 --> 01:59:36.634
Yeah, you know,
you got a point there,

01:59:36.676 --> 01:59:40.138
but I actually think that we have
more to gain than we do to lose.

01:59:41.097 --> 01:59:43.767
Ray, it's a bad idea.

01:59:45.810 --> 01:59:48.229
When I came to ABC, you guys
put in the contract ...

01:59:48.313 --> 01:59:50.356
that I can choose my own music.

01:59:51.232 --> 01:59:52.984
You want to read that paragraph?

01:59:57.197 --> 01:59:58.907
It's on page three.

02:00:00.241 --> 02:00:01.826
I don't need to see it.

02:00:11.211 --> 02:00:13.421
Good evening, Saint Louis.

02:00:13.505 --> 02:00:15.882
It's time
for the main attraction.

02:00:15.924 --> 02:00:19.511
The innovator of soul.
The genius himself.

02:00:19.844 --> 02:00:21.638
Ray Charles!

02:00:41.074 --> 02:00:42.242

02:00:47.413 --> 02:00:48.665
Thank you so much.

02:00:48.748 --> 02:00:51.918
You know what, I know that a
lot of y'all don't know that ...

02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:55.130
I ... I was brought up in the South.

02:00:55.213 --> 02:00:58.341
You know, every time you turn
on the radio there in the South,

02:00:58.425 --> 02:00:59.759
you hear the Grand Ole Opry.

02:00:59.843 --> 02:01:02.971
That's what I grew up singing,
so I hope you don't mind,

02:01:03.596 --> 02:01:07.100
I ... I want to sing something to give
you a taste of my country roots.

02:01:08.351 --> 02:01:09.644
"Unchain My Heart!"

02:01:09.853 --> 02:01:11.396

02:03:23.903 --> 02:03:25.989
They bought that country
jive hook, line and sinker.

02:03:26.072 --> 02:03:27.240
Ray, man, you're amazing.

02:03:27.323 --> 02:03:30.452
I'm gonna tell you something. Country
music. You know why they like it?

02:03:30.535 --> 02:03:32.662
The stories, man.
They got great stories.

02:03:32.745 --> 02:03:33.788
Hey, Joe.

02:03:33.872 --> 02:03:37.250
Ray, I want to introduce you to
Joe Adams. Hal Ziegler hired Joe ...

02:03:37.292 --> 02:03:39.669
as the announcer
for the rest of the tour.

02:03:39.753 --> 02:03:42.255
I know you, Mayor of Melody.

02:03:42.338 --> 02:03:44.799
I used to listen to your
radio show in L.A. In the '50s.

02:03:44.883 --> 02:03:47.427
We've both come a ways since then.

02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:50.138
What was that counting
you were doing back there?

02:03:50.263 --> 02:03:52.807
I was cueing down the lights.
That shuts up the audience ...

02:03:52.891 --> 02:03:55.518
so you can sing your ballad
instead of having to scream it.

02:03:55.602 --> 02:03:57.896
Hey, well, I'll be damned.
Who told you to do that?

02:03:57.937 --> 02:03:59.689
No one. It just needed to be done.

02:03:59.773 --> 02:04:01.608
See, that's what I'm talking about.

02:04:01.691 --> 02:04:04.611
I like to hear a person say
"It needed to be done" ...

02:04:04.652 --> 02:04:06.154
as opposed to a person saying,
"It ain't my job."

02:04:07.279 --> 02:04:07.914
Well, You know ...

02:04:08.114 --> 02:04:10.116
You know,
tell me about Central Avenue.

02:04:10.283 --> 02:04:11.618

We got the cover of Cash Box.

02:04:29.427 --> 02:04:32.639
The nation's hottest album:
"Modern Sounds of Country & Western."

02:04:32.722 --> 02:04:33.765

That's what they say.

02:04:34.933 --> 02:04:37.310
I've been watchin', your albums
are going through the roof,

02:04:37.393 --> 02:04:39.145
your concerts are
always selling out.

02:04:39.187 --> 02:04:40.772
You'll need shelters

02:04:45.318 --> 02:04:47.821
Jeff, Joe was in
the film Carmen Jones.

02:04:47.862 --> 02:04:49.405
Who was the director again?

02:04:49.489 --> 02:04:50.532
Otto Preminger.

02:04:50.615 --> 02:04:53.701
He was also on Broadway
with Lena Horne.

02:04:53.827 --> 02:04:56.287
She was the star.
I was supporting.

02:04:56.454 --> 02:04:57.997

You can see the whole L.A.
Basin from there.

02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:58.349
Not even Beverly Hills
has views like that.

How does it look, Bea, huh?
You like it, don't you?

02:06:01.186 --> 02:06:02.687
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

It has a big winding staircase,
just like "Gone With the Wind".

02:06:11.863 --> 02:06:15.033
We should get our portraits
painted, like Rhett and Scarlett.

02:06:15.241 --> 02:06:16.743
Bea, bring him on in here.

02:06:16.826 --> 02:06:19.245
Ray, wait till you hear
what's waiting in the living room.

02:06:19.287 --> 02:06:20.288
What is it?

02:06:20.413 --> 02:06:24.250
I had them build you a solid
marble fireplace, two stories high.

02:06:24.334 --> 02:06:26.503
Hot damn! How do you like it, Bea?

02:06:26.586 --> 02:06:27.670
It's awful big.

02:06:27.754 --> 02:06:29.339
It sure is: 8,500 square feet.

02:06:29.422 --> 02:06:31.216
Biggest house in the neighborhood.

02:06:31.257 --> 02:06:33.051
So, does this meet
with your approval?

02:06:33.093 --> 02:06:34.594
Man, this is a palace.

02:06:34.677 --> 02:06:37.180
You think this is big? Wait
until tomorrow when you see ...

02:06:37.263 --> 02:06:39.557

02:06:39.599 --> 02:06:41.392

02:06:41.434 --> 02:06:43.812

Your brand-new recording studio.

02:06:43.895 --> 02:06:45.522
Did you get everything I asked for?

02:06:45.605 --> 02:06:46.856
Totally state-of-the-art.

02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:50.902
Tom Dowd built an eight-track mixing
console, two recorders, the works.

02:06:50.944 --> 02:06:53.363
Now, this room is bigger
than most people's houses.

02:06:53.446 --> 02:06:55.865
- Got your own private bathroom
to your left. - Good.

02:06:55.949 --> 02:06:58.201

is my adjoining office.

02:06:58.284 --> 02:07:00.620
And step over to your
private bar to your left.

02:07:00.703 --> 02:07:02.622

Ray.

I'll be there as soon as I can.

02:07:53.882 --> 02:07:55.216

02:08:08.396 --> 02:08:10.356
I ... I just wouldn't
let that happen.

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:13.693
Yes, I'm sure, Ray.
I'm sure you set a fine example.

02:08:17.864 --> 02:08:19.616

02:08:24.078 --> 02:08:25.371

02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:28.124

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:32.337
He was born October 1, in
New York City. He's 3 years old.

02:08:33.296 --> 02:08:34.798

02:08:35.715 --> 02:08:37.509
He's at her sister's.

02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:41.221
All right. I'll start sending
them some money.

02:08:41.304 --> 02:08:44.390
You don't have to.
I send them money every month.

02:09:09.249 --> 02:09:10.875
In five minutes,
Mr. Charles will be here,

02:09:10.917 --> 02:09:12.419
and he'll be ready to go.

02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:14.045
Now the charts
Jeff is handing out ...

02:09:14.087 --> 02:09:16.923
should be turned in
at the conclusion of ...

02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:19.592
You're late, that's a $50 fine.

02:09:20.135 --> 02:09:21.594
I ain't late.

02:09:21.636 --> 02:09:23.721
I give them
a 10-minute grace period, Joe.

02:09:23.805 --> 02:09:27.100
Five minutes after two.
He's late. He'll be charged $50.

02:09:27.183 --> 02:09:29.686
What? You know what?
Where's Ray?

02:09:29.769 --> 02:09:32.105
You don't have to talk to Ray,
you're talking to me.

02:09:32.188 --> 02:09:36.401
I'll talk to whoever I damn well
please, and it sure as hell ain't you.

02:09:36.443 --> 02:09:37.777
Jive jerk.

02:09:42.532 --> 02:09:43.700
Hey, Ray,

02:09:43.783 --> 02:09:47.912
this fool Joe Adams is trying
to fine me for being late.

02:09:48.204 --> 02:09:49.664
What time did you get here?

02:09:49.748 --> 02:09:53.752
What? Just now.
The band's still setting up.

02:09:54.335 --> 02:09:55.962
- Jeff don't ...
- Look, I'm not Jeff.

02:09:56.045 --> 02:09:57.797
That's a fact, Jack!

02:09:58.965 --> 02:10:01.634
Ray, you said the band was my thing.

02:10:01.718 --> 02:10:03.178
It is.

02:10:03.261 --> 02:10:05.930
Then, Fathead,
you go on back to rehearsal.

02:10:06.973 --> 02:10:08.308
Ray.

02:10:08.767 --> 02:10:11.186
Ray, you know how it is,
you've been there.

02:10:11.728 --> 02:10:14.063
Fathead, go on now.
Let me handle this.

02:10:14.147 --> 02:10:15.857
Fathead, go on now.

02:10:19.319 --> 02:10:21.404
You want to tell me what the hell
is going on, Ray?

02:10:21.488 --> 02:10:23.490
I'm not doing anything
I haven't been asked to.

02:10:23.573 --> 02:10:25.116
Ray's running a business.

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:28.244
He shouldn't have to waste time
hearing why people were late.

02:10:28.328 --> 02:10:30.121
I'm not talking to you, Joe.

02:10:30.163 --> 02:10:31.915
I'm talking to Ray.

02:10:36.878 --> 02:10:39.839
Ray, now I know you think
I'm soft on the band,

02:10:39.881 --> 02:10:42.258
but those cats would do
whatever I ask.

02:10:42.342 --> 02:10:45.011
But If you come in here with this,
uh, "running a business" crap,

02:10:45.053 --> 02:10:47.305
you're gonna lose some good people.
I'm telling you, Ray.

02:10:47.347 --> 02:10:49.766
There are musicians waiting in
line to play with Ray Charles.

02:10:49.849 --> 02:10:52.685
Not for long,
once they get a taste of you.

02:10:53.353 --> 02:10:55.563
Ray, you're the leader, man.
Be one! Come on, now.

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:57.649
You now what Jeff, I mean
things have changed.

02:10:57.690 --> 02:11:00.777
It ain't like the days when it was
seven of us on the Chitlin' Circuit.

02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:04.322
I mean, if you weren't busy building
a bowling alley, you'd seen that.

02:11:04.697 --> 02:11:06.533
So you know about that, huh?

02:11:06.991 --> 02:11:08.910
I know about everything.

02:11:09.536 --> 02:11:11.496
I'm just trying to figure out
how you did it.

02:11:11.579 --> 02:11:13.206
You think
I'm stealing from you, Ray?

02:11:13.289 --> 02:11:16.543
If the Shaw Agency is gonna give you
a cut of the 10% I'm given them.

02:11:16.626 --> 02:11:19.587
I might as well keep the
goddamn money in my pocket.

02:11:19.879 --> 02:11:22.173
Leave us alone. We need to talk.

02:11:23.258 --> 02:11:24.342
Ray.

02:11:24.759 --> 02:11:26.803
You can step outside, Joe.

02:11:28.638 --> 02:11:30.432
I'll be in my office.

02:11:35.895 --> 02:11:39.774
Ray, now I know that jealous bastard
planted that lie in your head.

02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:43.403
But I have never stolen
from you, Ray, and I never will.

02:11:43.445 --> 02:11:47.282
I got a small business loan, and, yeah,
Milt Shaw was giving me a little extra,

02:11:47.365 --> 02:11:48.992
but I'm not a thief, Ray.

02:11:49.075 --> 02:11:50.410
Then what about that, Jeff, huh?

02:11:50.452 --> 02:11:54.539
A promoter swearing you did side deals
with him so you could split my overages!

02:11:54.622 --> 02:11:56.499
How could you do that to me?

02:11:56.583 --> 02:11:58.668
We've been through so much,
we be so like brothers.

02:11:58.752 --> 02:12:00.462
You know what, Ray?

02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:04.549
If we were like brothers,

02:12:04.883 --> 02:12:07.302
why are you paying Joe
more than you're paying me?

02:12:07.385 --> 02:12:09.763
Damn all that!
You broke my heart, man.

02:12:09.804 --> 02:12:14.142
Well, you know what, Ray? You broke
mine a long goddamn time ago!

02:12:14.976 --> 02:12:16.936
Well, then there it is.

02:12:23.568 --> 02:12:25.195
You know something, Ray?

02:12:25.278 --> 02:12:27.071
You're going to get yours one day.

02:12:27.113 --> 02:12:30.950
And I pray to God that he has mercy
on your soul, you son of a bitch!

02:12:38.708 --> 02:12:40.752
Everything all right, Ray?

02:12:41.961 --> 02:12:44.297
How the hell do you think it is?

02:12:54.974 --> 02:12:58.311
Go tell him. Go tell him!
Go, go tell him.

02:12:59.896 --> 02:13:01.272
Hey, Dad. Hi, there.

02:13:01.314 --> 02:13:03.358
I made the all-star team!
The game's on Thursday.

02:13:03.441 --> 02:13:04.484
Oh, that's great.

02:13:04.567 --> 02:13:07.320
Oh, damn! I'm not gonna be in town.
I'm gotta go on tour.

02:13:07.362 --> 02:13:09.948
How about I buy you guys
new uniforms, huh?

02:13:10.031 --> 02:13:12.075
Tell the coach I don't care
how much they cost.

02:13:12.158 --> 02:13:13.076
Okay.

02:13:13.159 --> 02:13:15.703
All right, son, you want to take
your dad's briefcase inside.

02:13:15.787 --> 02:13:18.415
The plane to Montreal leaves at 11:00.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

02:13:18.498 --> 02:13:19.457
All right.

02:13:19.999 --> 02:13:21.960
Did you hear what
Ray Junior said to you?

02:13:22.001 --> 02:13:22.961
Yeah.

02:13:23.002 --> 02:13:25.338
Do you know how much making the
all-star team means to him?

02:13:25.422 --> 02:13:27.882
I know. I got things on my mind.
We had to fire Jeff.

02:13:27.966 --> 02:13:28.967
What?

02:13:29.008 --> 02:13:30.051
He was stealing.

02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:31.219
- Jeff?
- Hmm.

02:13:31.302 --> 02:13:32.595
I don't believe it.

02:13:32.679 --> 02:13:34.639
Yeah, well,
we're better without him.

U.S. Customs!

02:14:39.287 --> 02:14:41.581
We're goanna need to see some
identification, please.

02:14:41.664 --> 02:14:43.416
You just arrived from Montreal?

02:14:43.458 --> 02:14:44.876
Yes. Is there a problem?

02:14:44.918 --> 02:14:47.253
We were alerted there might
be drugs on this plane.

02:14:47.337 --> 02:14:49.714
What? That's outrageous!
I'm going to call our lawyer.

02:14:49.756 --> 02:14:52.008
No lawyers
at international checkpoints.

02:14:52.092 --> 02:14:54.594
Now, we're going to have to
search everyone on this plane.

02:14:54.677 --> 02:14:57.430
Mr. Charles, if you don't mind
we'd like to start with you.

02:14:57.472 --> 02:14:59.349
I'd like to see your overcoat.

02:14:59.432 --> 02:15:00.642
I don't mind.

02:15:00.725 --> 02:15:02.102
Don't say anything, Ray.

02:15:02.769 --> 02:15:03.812
What's this?

02:15:05.772 --> 02:15:08.149
Ray, this isn't some judge
in Indiana.

02:15:08.233 --> 02:15:10.276
It's federal.
They can charge you with smuggling ...

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:12.070
which can mean real prison time.

02:15:13.363 --> 02:15:16.366
Our lawyers will do
what they can, but ...

02:15:36.136 --> 02:15:37.470
Hello.

02:15:39.597 --> 02:15:41.474
You can't hide out
in here forever, Ray.

02:15:41.516 --> 02:15:43.351
Look, it's my house.
I'm not in prison yet.

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:44.477
No, it's my house.

02:15:44.561 --> 02:15:47.439
You ain't been here more than
six days since we moved in.

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:49.566
No, Ray, no!
A needle ain't gonna solve this!

02:15:49.649 --> 02:15:50.608
Get out of the way. Move!

02:15:50.650 --> 02:15:52.485
Only thing
that can help you is God, Ray.

02:15:52.569 --> 02:15:55.280
Don't think of God? Do you have any
idea how it feels to go blind ...

02:15:55.321 --> 02:15:56.781
and still be afraid of the dark?

02:15:56.823 --> 02:15:59.993
And every day, you stand pray for just
a little light, and you get nothing.

02:16:00.076 --> 02:16:01.911
'Cause God don't listen
to people like me.

02:16:01.995 --> 02:16:03.037
Stop talking like that.

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:05.999
As far as I'm concerned, me and
God is even and I do what I please.

02:16:06.082 --> 02:16:08.126
If goddamn it, if I want
to shoot up, I shoot up.

02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:10.920
Then go ahead!
But you walk out that door ...

02:16:11.004 --> 02:16:13.339
and I'm doing something I should
have done a long time ago.

02:16:13.423 --> 02:16:15.175
I'm taking my boys and I'll leave.

02:16:15.216 --> 02:16:17.260
You're not going away.
You ... you have no place to go.

02:16:17.343 --> 02:16:18.845
- No place?
- No.

02:16:18.928 --> 02:16:21.014
You think I'm scared of losing this?

02:16:21.097 --> 02:16:24.017
Ray, the only thing I was
ever scared of losing was you.

02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:27.228
Because where was I ever gonna
find another Ray Robinson?

02:16:28.730 --> 02:16:31.316
So I put up with
some terrible stuff.

02:16:31.524 --> 02:16:33.359
Maybe that makes me part to blame.

02:16:33.442 --> 02:16:34.778
But I ain't scared no more.

02:16:34.861 --> 02:16:37.530
You know I love you and those
boys more than anything.

02:16:37.614 --> 02:16:40.032
That is a damn lie
and you know it!

02:16:41.575 --> 02:16:43.244
You ever look at this?

02:16:43.495 --> 02:16:45.746
Really look at it, Ray!

02:16:46.081 --> 02:16:49.166
Ray Charles Junior's
"Most Valuable Player."

02:16:50.584 --> 02:16:52.754
He was so proud this day,

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:57.717
until you came home too loaded
to go to his banquet.

02:16:57.759 --> 02:17:01.054
No! No! There is something you
love more than me and them boys,

02:17:01.096 --> 02:17:03.764
more than all the women you
ever slept with on the road,

02:17:03.848 --> 02:17:05.475
more than all
the dope you ever took.

02:17:05.558 --> 02:17:07.894
- What are you talking about?
- Your music.

02:17:09.771 --> 02:17:12.107
And if you don't stop
using that needle,

02:17:12.232 --> 02:17:15.360
they're gonna take away your
music and put you in jail.

02:17:19.239 --> 02:17:21.574
Is that poison
worth losing everything?

02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.368
Mr. Charles?

02:18:17.755 --> 02:18:19.257
Mr. Charles.

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:21.718
You don't have to go through this.

02:18:22.593 --> 02:18:26.431
We have a substitute that can
help wean you off heroin.

02:18:26.764 --> 02:18:30.977
I have to do it on my own.
I can do it. I can do it.

02:18:31.686 --> 02:18:33.146
Ah. Don't touch me.

02:18:36.483 --> 02:18:37.816
All right.

02:18:38.317 --> 02:18:40.028
We'll do it your way.

02:18:51.121 --> 02:18:52.457
Doctor?

02:18:52.707 --> 02:18:55.752
Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles,
I'm coming.

02:18:56.503 --> 02:18:58.213
He's got no fluids left.

02:18:58.338 --> 02:19:00.090
Get an I.V. in him right away.

02:19:00.507 --> 02:19:02.342
- I'll insert the needle.
- No needles.

02:19:02.424 --> 02:19:04.343
Yes. It's very important.
You need this.

02:19:04.427 --> 02:19:06.346
Runner, I've got a runner!

02:19:07.013 --> 02:19:08.013
Whoa.

02:19:09.599 --> 02:19:12.018
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Get him on the bed.

02:19:12.602 --> 02:19:15.105
Put those restraints on him.

02:19:15.563 --> 02:19:17.147
No needles.

02:19:35.416 --> 02:19:36.876
No, no.

02:19:37.877 --> 02:19:39.254
Oh.

02:19:43.258 --> 02:19:45.593
George, I miss you.
I miss you, George.

02:19:45.718 --> 02:19:48.054
I miss you.

02:19:52.725 --> 02:19:54.060
Oh.

02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:08.825
- Okay.
- Uh-oh.

02:20:08.908 --> 02:20:11.202
You might be in trouble
right there, Doc.

02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:22.505
Hot damn,
you whupped my ass again!

02:20:22.589 --> 02:20:25.341
I — I'll tell you what, I won't
lose again the same way twice.

02:20:25.425 --> 02:20:28.887
I spoke with the judge in Boston,
and he'll agree to probation.

02:20:29.179 --> 02:20:31.431
He was impressed with
your attorney's arguments,

02:20:31.514 --> 02:20:33.558
and he believes
you deserve one more chance.

02:20:33.641 --> 02:20:35.059
Oh, that's great.

02:20:35.101 --> 02:20:37.103
But you must complete
our program ...

02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:39.230
and agree to take
periodic drug tests.

02:20:39.314 --> 02:20:41.566
You know what. I'll do it.
I know people don't believe ...

02:20:41.608 --> 02:20:43.818
I'm done with this dope,
but I'm finished.

02:20:44.778 --> 02:20:46.112
Who's George?

02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:51.993
Ray,

02:20:52.619 --> 02:20:55.413
you've come through the worst of
the physical reactions.

02:20:55.997 --> 02:20:58.833
We should begin
psychotherapy sessions.

02:20:58.917 --> 02:21:01.503
Uh, look, forget
the head shrinking, Doc.

02:21:01.586 --> 02:21:03.213
I can handle this.

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:09.010
Mr. Charles,

02:21:09.094 --> 02:21:11.763
you're not the first
celebrity junkie I've treated.

02:21:11.805 --> 02:21:12.931
Junkie? What ...

02:21:13.014 --> 02:21:15.058
Nobody cons me at any price.

02:21:15.141 --> 02:21:16.142
I'm not trying to do that.

02:21:16.226 --> 02:21:19.437
If you want me to give that judge
a positive report,

02:21:19.479 --> 02:21:21.481
you will have to earn it.

02:21:24.943 --> 02:21:25.985
Doc?

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:28.404
Dr. Hacker?

02:21:28.905 --> 02:21:29.948
Doc?

02:22:02.397 --> 02:22:05.233
Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me!

02:22:09.279 --> 02:22:10.947
He ain't there.

02:22:19.330 --> 02:22:21.166
Talk to me, son.

02:22:22.125 --> 02:22:25.670
I ain't no bad dream.
I'm a part of you.

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:28.506
Even all that dope
couldn't keep me away.

02:22:31.468 --> 02:22:33.428
Mama, I kept my promise.

02:22:33.553 --> 02:22:35.430
You got strong all right.

02:22:35.513 --> 02:22:37.348
Went places I never dreamed of.

02:22:38.057 --> 02:22:40.310
But you still became a cripple.

02:22:46.065 --> 02:22:48.151
Come here, baby. Come here.

02:22:55.742 --> 02:22:56.910
Ray?

02:23:03.416 --> 02:23:05.168
It wasn't your fault.

02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:12.050
Now promise us ...

02:23:12.342 --> 02:23:14.052
you'll never let
nobody or nothing ...

02:23:14.135 --> 02:23:16.554
turn you into
no cripple ever again.

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:19.724
That you'll always stand
on your own two feet.

02:23:20.683 --> 02:23:21.851
Promise.

02:23:42.789 --> 02:23:44.833
Today we're here
to right a wrong ...

02:23:44.916 --> 02:23:48.336
that was done to one of our
native sons nearly 20 years ago.

02:23:48.878 --> 02:23:50.338
In 1961,

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:54.092
Ray Charles was banned from
performing in the state of Georgia ...

02:23:54.175 --> 02:23:57.303
because he refused to play
before a segregated audience.

02:23:57.595 --> 02:24:00.557
Thankfully, we've come
a long way since then.

02:24:00.974 --> 02:24:04.310
Some of us have fought for equality
through the political process,

02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:08.940
but Ray Charles changed American
culture by touching people's hearts.

02:24:09.274 --> 02:24:13.027
So on this day, March 7, 1979,

02:24:13.570 --> 02:24:16.740
we, the duly elected representatives
of the State of Georgia ...

02:24:17.073 --> 02:24:21.077
not only proclaim "Georgia on My Mind"
our official state song,

02:24:21.411 --> 02:24:24.622
we also offer Mr. Ray Charles
a public apology ...

02:24:24.664 --> 02:24:26.624
and welcome him back home.
