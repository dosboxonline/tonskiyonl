<i>Give me land, lots of land
under starry skies above...</i>

01:35.138 --> 01:39.475
<i>Let me be by myself in the evening breeze</i>

01:39.851 --> 01:43.813
<i>Listen to the murmur
of the cottonwood trees</i>

01:43.896 --> 01:45.648
<i>Send me off forever</i>

01:45.732 --> 01:47.817
<i>But I ask you please</i>

01:48.026 --> 01:50.236
<i>Don't fence me in</i>

01:50.778 --> 01:52.780
<i>Just turn me loose</i>

01:52.864 --> 01:54.824
<i>Let me straddle my own saddle</i>

01:54.907 --> 01:57.535
<i>Underneath the western skies</i>

01:57.618 --> 01:58.745
<i>Oo-oo</i>

01:58.828 --> 02:00.997
<i>On my cayuse</i>

02:01.080 --> 02:03.291
<i>Let me wander over yonder</i>

02:03.374 --> 02:05.251
<i>Till I see the mountains rise</i>

02:05.335 --> 02:07.045
<i>Oo-oo-oo-oo</i>

02:07.128 --> 02:12.842
<i>I want to ride to the ridge
where the West commences</i>

02:12.967 --> 02:16.804
<i>Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses</i>

02:16.888 --> 02:20.892
<i>Can't look at hobbles
and I can't stand fences</i>

02:20.975 --> 02:23.061
<i>Don't fence me in</i>

02:23.811 --> 02:25.855
<i>Just turn me loose</i>

02:25.938 --> 02:27.899
<i>Let me straddle my own saddle</i>

02:27.982 --> 02:30.276
<i>Underneath the western skies</i>

02:30.360 --> 02:32.445
<i>Oo-oo</i>

02:33.655 --> 02:35.323
On...

02:36.199 --> 02:37.867
Hey!

02:38.284 --> 02:39.577
Hey!

02:40.286 --> 02:41.454
Come back here.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.206
Hey!

02:43.623 --> 02:45.708
Hey!

02:46.334 --> 02:48.419
I hate that when you do that!

02:48.503 --> 02:50.296
I was bored to death.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.423
Well, I was having fun.

02:52.507 --> 02:54.425
Well, good for you.

02:54.509 --> 02:56.719
- Get in!
- No, I'm grabbing a cab.

02:56.803 --> 02:58.179
Get in!

02:58.262 --> 02:59.931
Stop it!

03:00.014 --> 03:02.100
Leave me alone, Eddie.

03:02.809 --> 03:06.187
Don't ever try that again...

03:06.980 --> 03:08.856
...or else!

03:08.940 --> 03:10.817
Or else what?

03:52.275 --> 03:56.362
Mr. Yoshida says,
"We regret we can go no further. "

03:56.446 --> 03:58.865
"This is our final proposal. "

03:58.948 --> 04:02.910
"Your company will benefit greatly
from this new relationship. "

04:02.994 --> 04:06.080
"Now you must decide the fate of MicroCon. "

04:06.164 --> 04:08.791
We should close at this price.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.711
Let's see if we can hold out
till Congress votes.

04:11.794 --> 04:13.755
We can't pull back just now.

04:13.838 --> 04:15.923
Deal's too far gone.

04:16.007 --> 04:19.302
We can't pull back just now.
Deal's too far gone.

04:19.385 --> 04:24.015
- They'll suspect if we stall.
- They'll suspect if we stall.

04:24.098 --> 04:28.311
Listen, I'm the last guy
who wants to screw this up.

04:28.394 --> 04:32.482
Deal's too good,
but we have to have some strategy.

04:32.565 --> 04:35.401
That's what I'm saying.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.699
They're going to stall.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.846
Hey, guys.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.432
- How's it going?
- Good.

05:07.809 --> 05:11.104
If there's anything you don't understand...

05:11.187 --> 05:13.189
Oh, no. We're uh...

05:13.272 --> 05:16.025
- We're fine.
- Great. That's good to hear.

05:16.109 --> 05:18.444
You're gonna be part of a great team.

05:18.528 --> 05:22.907
Once these guys draw
a line in the sand, that's pretty much it.

05:22.991 --> 05:26.369
You want that research and development
money, don't you?

05:26.452 --> 05:28.538
Nakamoto Group can do a lot for you.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.623
- Yeah, right.
- Great.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.418
That guy is an asshole.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.837
That guy is an asshole.

05:36.587 --> 05:41.676
The deal will put vital elements of our
military weaponry under Japanese control.

05:41.759 --> 05:45.305
Come on, Senator Morton.
That's really a scare tactic.

05:45.388 --> 05:50.435
During the Gulf War, the Japanese suggested
they could deny us that weaponry. In fact...

05:50.518 --> 05:53.563
- You're oversimplifying a complex issue.
- No...

05:53.646 --> 05:59.527
He's trying to say America is looking for
a new enemy now the Cold War is over.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.487
Talk about simplifying!

06:01.571 --> 06:04.741
You're doing the simplifying, Senator.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.163
Hold on.

06:10.246 --> 06:13.416
Let's let... Eleanor,
let the Senator in, please.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.585
I came here to Los Angeles because...

06:15.668 --> 06:20.632
Before we hear that, I couldn't detect
exactly how you're going to vote.

06:20.715 --> 06:24.344
- You know, they warned me about you.
- Well, they should!

06:24.427 --> 06:25.511
They should!

06:25.595 --> 06:28.806
- How are you going to vote?
- Against the sale of MicroCon.

06:28.890 --> 06:31.225
Thank you for saying that flat out.

06:31.309 --> 06:33.478
Let me ask you guys on this side.

06:33.561 --> 06:38.358
You sometimes make it sound as if
Japan's prosperity is bad for America.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.151
Is that what you mean?

06:40.234 --> 06:45.490
The real issue is that this technology
is paid for by American taxpayers...

07:07.095 --> 07:12.809
This discussion is degenerating
into the kind of argument we don't need.

07:12.892 --> 07:16.312
This is already a very tense situation.

07:16.396 --> 07:19.399
There will soon be a vote
in Congress and we will decide...

07:19.482 --> 07:21.776
...whether the MicroCon sale goes through.

07:27.699 --> 07:29.993
I don't get you, Eddie.

07:30.076 --> 07:32.161
So what?

07:46.884 --> 07:48.970
Oh, ladies, one thing.

07:49.429 --> 07:54.726
Do remember that the custom here
is bow when you're bowed to.

07:55.310 --> 07:58.396
Oh, wow!
They really rolled out the red carpet.

08:00.773 --> 08:03.776
- What floor are we going to?
- 45th.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.988
- After you, Greg.
- Thank you, Rick.

08:15.330 --> 08:17.332
Yokasai Irashaimase.

08:17.415 --> 08:20.126
Bow when you're bowed to.

08:20.209 --> 08:23.755
- Oh, wow! Look at this. Everybody's here.
- This is amazing!

08:23.838 --> 08:26.132
There's Barry Hirsch. The Mayor.

08:26.215 --> 08:30.303
- We're in the fast lane now.
- Oh, we sure are.

08:31.012 --> 08:35.265
- Look, here's Yoshida-san and the boys.
- Get ready to bow.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.562
Wife.

08:53.785 --> 08:56.162
- Taiko drums!
- Huh?

08:56.245 --> 09:01.209
Taiko drums. Long ago
they were used to drive away evil spirits.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.452
Come here.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.340
No, here.

11:16.469 --> 11:18.012
Yes.

11:35.905 --> 11:37.991
Yes...

11:41.327 --> 11:43.413
Yes... More...

11:43.496 --> 11:45.581
Ah, yes...

11:46.791 --> 11:49.335
Yo, what's up?

11:49.419 --> 11:53.923
Web. Tom Graham. You're on the chart
tonight, Special Services liaison.

11:54.007 --> 11:56.092
- Yeah, yeah.
- Better get over here.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.845
The new Nakamoto building. 1100 Figueroa.

11:58.928 --> 12:02.307
- I can't believe they're pulling this shit.
- What stuff?

12:02.390 --> 12:05.435
Demanding to see
the fuckin' Special Services liaison.

12:05.518 --> 12:09.564
They say the police can't proceed
until you get here.

12:09.647 --> 12:13.318
And what time
was that phone call from Lieutenant Graham?

12:13.401 --> 12:15.486
What time?

12:15.987 --> 12:18.239
Yes. What time was it?

12:18.323 --> 12:20.408
9:00 pm.

12:21.117 --> 12:22.910
February 9th.

12:22.994 --> 12:25.705
Four nights ago?

12:28.333 --> 12:30.418
Was that a yes, Lieutenant Smith?

12:30.501 --> 12:32.754
Yeah. It's a yeah.

12:34.422 --> 12:37.842
Lieutenant Smith,
we appreciate your cooperation.

12:37.925 --> 12:42.138
You waived your right
to be represented here by an attorney.

12:42.221 --> 12:47.435
So... Lieutenant Graham called for
the Special Services liaison.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.148
He said he had a homicide.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.026
Yeah, a homicide. Apparent 601.

12:55.109 --> 12:58.112
Caucasian female, I'd say 25.

12:58.446 --> 13:02.909
Lying flat on her back on the
boardroom table like a piece of sushi.

13:02.992 --> 13:06.371
Quite a sight. Better get down here.

13:08.915 --> 13:14.003
Hello. I'm a police officer.
Can I be of assistance?

13:14.796 --> 13:18.633
Konnichiwa. Watashi wa keisatsu kan desu.

13:19.550 --> 13:23.388
Konnichiwa. Watashi wa keisatsu kan desu.

13:26.849 --> 13:30.603
May I see your passport?
Pasuporto misete kudosai.

13:30.687 --> 13:34.482
Pasuporto, misha shugas...
mish shuga... nasai.

13:38.111 --> 13:41.406
- What's up?
- This is Watch Commander Hoffman.

13:41.489 --> 13:43.574
Yes, sir.

13:43.658 --> 13:47.245
You're on your way to Nakamoto Towers.
I want you to pick someone up.

13:47.328 --> 13:49.831
- Certainly, sir.
- A guy named Connor.

13:49.914 --> 13:52.500
- Connor?
- Yeah, John Connor.

13:53.126 --> 13:55.837
But I thought... he was long gone.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.132
No, he's very much alive.
They put in a request for him.

13:59.215 --> 14:02.051
- They? Who's they?
- You go. I'll phone him.

14:02.135 --> 14:05.722
- He lives by Little Tokyo. 428 Rose Street.
- Yes, sir.

14:26.659 --> 14:28.745
428 Rose Street.

14:50.058 --> 14:52.143
Connor?

14:58.232 --> 15:01.736
And you did not know
Captain Connor prior to this night?

15:01.819 --> 15:03.780
No, I did not.

15:03.863 --> 15:06.491
- I'd only heard about him.
- What had you heard?

15:06.574 --> 15:10.745
I heard that he had long ago
put himself on indefinite leave.

15:10.828 --> 15:14.791
That he had lived in Japan.
Some people thought they got to him.

15:14.874 --> 15:16.542
Some people said that...

15:17.335 --> 15:19.587
Said what?

15:19.671 --> 15:22.173
The man couldn't be trusted.

15:23.132 --> 15:24.801
You're late.

15:25.927 --> 15:27.220
Yeah, sorry.

15:27.303 --> 15:29.389
- The directions were...
- No.

15:29.889 --> 15:31.975
Be on time.

15:41.734 --> 15:43.277
Shoes.

15:55.748 --> 16:00.586
Is it normal procedure now for the Japanese
to demand a liaison officer?

16:00.670 --> 16:03.298
No. It's usually an assignment.

16:03.381 --> 16:05.216
What time were you called?

16:05.300 --> 16:08.136
Lieutenant Graham called at nine.
Hoffman called in the car.

16:08.219 --> 16:10.555
You were called twice?

16:10.638 --> 16:12.432
Yeah.

16:12.515 --> 16:15.018
I wish I'd known that sooner.

16:18.313 --> 16:20.815
Have you negotiated with the Japanese?

16:20.898 --> 16:22.692
Negotiated?

16:22.775 --> 16:26.321
Mm. Perhaps I can suggest the strategy.

16:26.404 --> 16:28.531
Well, this is hardly a negotiation.

16:28.614 --> 16:31.326
Oh? What is it, then?

16:33.411 --> 16:35.288
What is it?

16:35.371 --> 16:37.123
It's a homicide.

16:39.542 --> 16:43.588
When we arrive,
you take charge of the negotiations.

16:43.671 --> 16:46.007
Don't introduce me or refer to me.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.468
Don't even look in my direction.

16:48.551 --> 16:53.890
Keep your jacket buttoned at all times.
If they bow, you bow back.

16:53.973 --> 16:56.601
Believe it or not, I have done this before.

16:56.684 --> 16:58.770
You know, I do know these things.

16:58.853 --> 17:01.230
Do keep your hands at your sides.

17:01.314 --> 17:05.068
The Japanese find
big arm movements threatening.

17:05.693 --> 17:07.694
Keep your voice calm and even.

17:07.779 --> 17:10.865
You'll probably find them
irritating tonight.

17:10.948 --> 17:13.785
But whatever happens,
don't lose your temper.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.912
I don't lose my temper.

17:15.994 --> 17:18.080
That's good to know.

17:18.164 --> 17:20.916
When you start to get into trouble...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.002
I won't get into trouble.

17:23.086 --> 17:26.130
When you start to get into trouble...

17:26.214 --> 17:30.009
...I will say, "Perhaps
I can be of assistance?"

17:30.969 --> 17:33.221
From then on, I do the talking.

17:33.304 --> 17:37.016
You stand behind me.
And don't appear distracted.

17:37.100 --> 17:41.854
We may come from a fragmented,
MTV, rap-video culture, but they do not.

17:41.938 --> 17:46.985
Every aspect of your appearance
and behavior will reflect on you...

17:47.068 --> 17:49.821
...the Department, and me as your sempai.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.990
- My sempai?
- Mm.

17:52.073 --> 17:54.283
That wouldn't be massa, would it?

17:56.703 --> 18:03.251
No. The sempai is the senior man
who guides the junior man, the kohai.

18:05.295 --> 18:09.382
In Japan, the sempai-kohai relationship
is presumed to exist...

18:09.465 --> 18:12.677
...when the younger man and the older man
work together.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.888
Hopefully, they will presume that of us.

18:23.479 --> 18:27.150
So what does it mean
that I was called twice?

18:27.233 --> 18:29.319
It means they're ahead of us.

18:29.402 --> 18:32.572
For all they know,
I could have been five minutes away.

18:32.655 --> 18:36.868
They know who was on call tonight,
how long it would take you to get here.

18:36.951 --> 18:39.037
They know all about you.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.205
- All about me?
- Mm.

18:42.665 --> 18:45.376
- It took you long enough.
- Tom.

18:48.421 --> 18:50.632
What the fuck's he doing here?

18:50.715 --> 18:52.967
Fred Hoffman told me to bring him.

18:53.051 --> 18:55.136
The guy is trouble. Watch out.

18:55.219 --> 18:59.265
The Department put him on leave
because he's too close to Japan.

18:59.349 --> 19:02.560
- He's not a team player.
- Where is everybody?

19:02.644 --> 19:05.146
They made us put our cars around back.

19:05.229 --> 19:09.192
They keep saying
nothing must disrupt the grand opening.

19:09.275 --> 19:12.779
Finding that blonde piece of sushi
drove them nuts.

19:12.862 --> 19:15.990
Don't want their guests
or the press to know.

19:18.076 --> 19:20.161
Step aside, pal.

19:20.828 --> 19:23.539
- You come down already.
- Yeah?

19:23.623 --> 19:25.625
Well, now I go back up.

19:25.708 --> 19:29.128
Maybe come down, go up 10 times more. OK?

19:32.840 --> 19:37.011
We're still the fuckin' police
in our own country.

19:38.388 --> 19:41.099
Built this building in six months.

19:41.182 --> 19:45.895
Prefab units from Japan, slapped 'em
together here. Not one American worker.

19:45.979 --> 19:49.107
City gave 'em an eight-year break
on property taxes.

19:49.190 --> 19:51.567
Shit! We're giving this country away.

19:51.651 --> 19:53.486
Nobody forced us to do it.

19:57.490 --> 19:59.158
Jesus!

19:59.242 --> 20:03.788
If an elevator's gonna talk, it should
speak in American. What did it say?

20:03.871 --> 20:06.624
We're arriving at the 45th floor.

20:08.293 --> 20:09.877
No, no. Wait a second.

20:09.961 --> 20:14.924
The Japanese provide jobs here,
but US companies are moving jobs offshore.

20:15.008 --> 20:17.093
Ground floor, please.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.262
- They must...
- Going up, Senator.

20:19.345 --> 20:23.057
- No, no. I wish to go down.
- Get the next one, Senator.

20:23.141 --> 20:25.226
Come on.

20:27.895 --> 20:31.357
No, no, no. You don't understand!

20:32.692 --> 20:34.527
Senator Morton.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.322
Real nice to find him partying here...

20:37.405 --> 20:42.327
...considering he's on the committee
which sets all import regulations.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.997
Geronimo!

20:46.623 --> 20:48.708
Coming through!

21:05.933 --> 21:08.311
I have your liaison for you.

21:08.603 --> 21:10.730
Konbanwa. Hajimemashite.

21:10.813 --> 21:12.649
Hajimemashite.

21:12.732 --> 21:15.318
Watashi wa Sumisu desu. Dozo.

21:15.943 --> 21:18.946
Watashi wa Ishihara desu. Dozo.

21:19.072 --> 21:22.200
Is this your home phone, Detective?

21:22.825 --> 21:25.745
Yes. Right there at the bottom.

21:25.828 --> 21:28.790
Detective, let's dispense
with the formalities.

21:28.873 --> 21:32.543
We'd like to cooperate,
but you can't start without a warrant.

21:32.627 --> 21:36.422
- Bullshit. We don't need one.
- We can get one in 15 minutes.

21:36.506 --> 21:40.760
- But we do have a reported homicide here.
- More likely a drug overdose.

21:40.843 --> 21:43.179
We can't know that until we investigate.

21:43.262 --> 21:44.722
Obviously.

21:44.806 --> 21:49.686
But I'm concerned about the attempt to link
this death to our reception downstairs.

21:49.769 --> 21:53.940
I don't know, sir.
Looks like she's wearing a party dress.

21:54.023 --> 21:55.733
She is, I agree.

21:55.817 --> 21:59.862
Lieutenant, you have to appreciate
the position of the Nakamoto Corporation.

21:59.946 --> 22:03.074
- Sir, I...
- This is an important evening for us.

22:03.157 --> 22:05.243
A very public evening.

22:05.326 --> 22:09.622
We don't want it marred by the death
of a woman of no importance.

22:09.706 --> 22:11.958
- Of no importance?
- You have some nerve!

22:12.041 --> 22:14.545
I can't imagine how she came to be
in the building at all.

22:14.546 --> 22:15.546
You have some nerve!

22:15.628 --> 22:19.007
Your Lieutenant Graham intends
to interrogate everybody...

22:19.090 --> 22:21.759
...the Mayor, the Senators, and Congressmen.

22:21.843 --> 22:23.970
Graham said that?

22:25.263 --> 22:28.099
Oh, Christ! What is this?

22:28.182 --> 22:30.351
Do you mind turning around?

22:30.435 --> 22:33.396
- Who is he?
- Mr. Tanaka works for Nakamoto Security.

22:33.479 --> 22:37.025
- Get him outta here!
- We have authorized him to be here.

22:37.108 --> 22:40.987
I'm authorizing him out! He's
contaminating the area. And get his film!

22:41.070 --> 22:43.134
We must undertake
our own private inquiry.

22:43.135 --> 22:46.535
I'll get you a warrant
and a restraining order!

22:46.618 --> 22:49.120
Do that! Be my guest!

22:49.287 --> 22:53.791
Excuse me.
Perhaps uh... I can be of assistance.

22:59.589 --> 23:02.592
Hajimemashite. John Connor desu.

23:08.848 --> 23:10.933
John Connor-san.

23:14.062 --> 23:16.147
Watashi wa Ishihara.

23:18.441 --> 23:23.404
Ishihara-san, I'm sure none of your guests
are involved in this unfortunate incident.

23:23.488 --> 23:25.573
They are free to go as they wish.

23:26.866 --> 23:29.452
I am grateful for your assistance.

23:29.535 --> 23:34.374
But before they leave, give me
the names of those gentlemen, please.

23:35.166 --> 23:36.876
I'm sorry.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.796
The names of those gentlemen.

23:41.381 --> 23:43.466
May I ask why?

23:51.182 --> 23:54.811
- Ritchie! Mug shots! All of them!
- You cannot do this!

23:56.312 --> 23:58.731
No! You are to blame here!

23:58.815 --> 24:01.109
You will assist my detectives!

24:01.192 --> 24:03.695
And I want to know who discovered the body!

24:05.113 --> 24:07.198
And don’t you fuck with me!

24:10.243 --> 24:13.371
But of course... Captain.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.918
Yeah, don't fuck with us.

24:19.002 --> 24:22.714
Mount up, boys. Let's get it done
before she starts to smell.

24:22.797 --> 24:28.011
- Isn't it bad form to lose your temper?
- It is. But I had to, to assist Ishihara.

24:28.094 --> 24:29.846
Assist Ishihara?

24:29.929 --> 24:32.432
Now why would you wanna do that?

24:32.515 --> 24:35.101
He wasn't the most important man
in the room.

24:35.184 --> 24:37.687
- Oh, he wasn't?
- No. It was the older man.

24:38.479 --> 24:40.773
His juyaku, his superior.

24:40.857 --> 24:46.857
But I wanted to get the investigation going
so I played the out-of-control gaijin.

24:46.946 --> 24:49.324
So Ishihara wouldn't lose face.

24:53.661 --> 24:56.581
So now, Ishihara owes me a favor.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.085
Deep, isn't it?

25:01.169 --> 25:03.254
Heavy.

25:08.801 --> 25:10.887
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:12.305 --> 25:14.807
The executive fuck chamber.

25:15.475 --> 25:18.269
Oh, man, I like this! I like this!

25:18.811 --> 25:21.356
That's nice. That's nice.

25:21.439 --> 25:24.442
These guys sure know how to do business.

25:47.590 --> 25:49.676
Hold that.

25:50.969 --> 25:53.346
Her nostrils look like
a margarita glass rim.

25:53.429 --> 25:56.724
- Think she OD'd on coke?
- I don't think so.

25:56.808 --> 26:00.979
We'll get lab values on all fluids.
Some seminal fluid down here.

26:01.062 --> 26:03.564
External genitals are pretty raw.

26:03.648 --> 26:08.653
It looks like forced intercourse,
but I'm not sure she was murdered.

26:08.736 --> 26:12.490
Not sure she was murdered?
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.

26:12.573 --> 26:17.161
The make-up on the neck
covers signs of prior throat injuries.

26:17.245 --> 26:20.331
That suggests a pattern
of repeated cervical trauma.

26:20.415 --> 26:22.792
Could be a case of sexual asphyxia.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.752
She's a gasper.

26:24.836 --> 26:26.921
Which is what?

26:27.005 --> 26:31.551
Individuals sexually aroused by
the hypoxia of near-strangulation.

26:31.634 --> 26:36.431
They ask their partners to strangle them
or suffocate them during sex.

26:36.514 --> 26:39.350
It's easy to make a mistake and go too far.

26:39.434 --> 26:42.812
This looks like death from inhibition to me.

26:42.895 --> 26:46.524
- Instantaneous physiological death.
- Meaning what?

26:46.607 --> 26:48.818
The person just... dies.

26:48.901 --> 26:50.987
Happens with neck or chest injuries.

26:51.070 --> 26:54.657
Had a kid got hit with a baseball.
Fell down dead in the schoolyard.

26:54.741 --> 26:57.285
Yeah. Maybe she got hit with a baseball.

26:57.368 --> 26:59.454
Odds are she was strangled.

26:59.537 --> 27:02.832
But since having sex isn't a felony,
it wouldn't be murder.

27:02.915 --> 27:06.711
Anyway, file in the back of your mind
that maybe she just popped off.

27:06.794 --> 27:11.549
Cheryl Lynn Austin. Age 23.
This says she has a Westwood address...

27:11.633 --> 27:14.594
...but she hasn't changed
her Kentucky license yet.

27:14.677 --> 27:17.805
Japanese cigarettes and credit cards.

27:18.389 --> 27:22.894
Nice tight roll of $100 bills.
Miss Austin's well taken care of.

27:22.977 --> 27:25.229
These little guys eat shit in Tokyo.

27:25.313 --> 27:28.483
Crammed into subways,
working for big companies.

27:28.566 --> 27:30.943
They come here and they're rich and free.

27:31.027 --> 27:33.321
They all want to fuck a Rose Bowl queen.

27:33.404 --> 27:37.283
And then kill the Rose Bowl queen
on the Nakamoto boardroom table?

27:37.367 --> 27:40.495
Call the police and create a scandal?

27:42.038 --> 27:44.123
Is that your theory?

27:44.207 --> 27:46.292
- My theory?
- Mm.

27:46.376 --> 27:50.588
My theory is that these guys
are known perversion freaks.

27:50.672 --> 27:52.924
I got a nose for these things.

27:53.007 --> 27:55.093
I'm sure.

27:58.972 --> 28:01.265
Hey, Spider-san.

28:01.349 --> 28:03.434
Tell your pal they got a contest.

28:03.518 --> 28:06.104
Whoever kisses the most asses
wins a Toyota.

28:08.481 --> 28:10.775
Hey, Graham! Want some sushi?

28:10.858 --> 28:14.195
Nah. If I get a craving for mercury,
I'll eat a thermometer.

28:15.530 --> 28:19.075
In Japan, criminals expect to be caught.

28:19.826 --> 28:22.203
Convictions run about 90%.

28:23.121 --> 28:27.250
Here, it's closer to 17.5%.

28:28.167 --> 28:30.336
They think we're stupid.

28:31.087 --> 28:33.381
They think we're corrupt.

28:33.464 --> 28:35.967
And they're not often wrong.

28:47.603 --> 28:49.689
What the hell are you doing?

28:49.772 --> 28:52.275
Good evening, officers. Can I help you?

28:52.358 --> 28:54.736
Yes, you can. Where are you located?

28:54.819 --> 28:59.449
- Lobby level. Across from the elevators.
- Thank you.

28:59.532 --> 29:02.452
How long
have you been on duty tonight?

29:02.535 --> 29:04.621
About half an hour.

29:04.704 --> 29:07.707
Mr. Tanaka was here when I got here.

29:07.790 --> 29:10.126
Mr. Tanaka? Who's Mr. Tanaka?

29:10.209 --> 29:12.295
He's the head of security.

29:13.379 --> 29:17.008
Mr. Phillips, the 46th floor, the cameras?

29:17.091 --> 29:20.511
I know in Japan
they like to observe their workers...

29:20.595 --> 29:23.348
...to help them improve their efficiency.

29:23.431 --> 29:27.185
I saw at least four up there. Why so many?

29:35.109 --> 29:37.612
You didn't hear this from me.

29:38.029 --> 29:41.366
I guarantee we didn't hear it from you.

29:42.700 --> 29:48.122
Maybe they put in a couple of new cameras
to observe those negotiations.

29:48.206 --> 29:50.917
What negotiations were those?

29:51.709 --> 29:54.545
The ones that go on up
there during the day...

29:54.629 --> 29:57.256
...with a company called MicroCon.

29:57.340 --> 30:00.468
MicroCon. The computer chip company?

30:00.551 --> 30:04.180
There's a vote coming up
in Congress on that deal.

30:05.556 --> 30:07.642
Put up the 46th floor.

30:13.398 --> 30:15.984
Can the camera get in closer?

30:16.067 --> 30:19.278
- You have to use the gizmo.
- The gizmo? Show me.

30:23.741 --> 30:28.329
You, uh, use the gizmo... to zoom in.

30:28.413 --> 30:32.834
This is all next-generation. There is
nothing like this in this country... yet.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.003
You record by disk?

30:35.086 --> 30:37.547
Record? What do you mean, record?

30:37.630 --> 30:39.632
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:39.716 --> 30:42.218
The disks are all back there.

30:45.596 --> 30:50.268
It's all there on
next-generation laser disk.

30:59.402 --> 31:02.572
I'd like to see tonight's
disk for the 46th floor.

31:02.655 --> 31:04.741
Uh...

31:06.200 --> 31:10.455
You'd have to talk with my supervisor.
You got a warrant?

31:14.375 --> 31:18.004
These disks record for 12 hours.

31:19.631 --> 31:23.176
Why does the one on the 46th floor
only show two hours?

31:23.259 --> 31:25.345
Excuse me?

31:28.056 --> 31:31.851
The original disk isn't even here,
anyway, is it?

31:31.934 --> 31:34.437
Because it's been replaced.

31:35.229 --> 31:36.356
Uh...

31:36.439 --> 31:38.816
I wouldn't know about that.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.694
That's Mr. Tanaka's department.

31:42.403 --> 31:45.740
Someone at this very moment is watching us.

31:48.117 --> 31:52.372
Under the circumstances,
you've been more than helpful.

31:52.455 --> 31:56.000
I'd like to tell you officers something.

31:56.084 --> 31:58.169
This is a good job.

31:58.252 --> 32:02.966
Around here, if something doesn't work,
I got a problem...

32:03.049 --> 32:05.551
...I tell somebody, they fix it!

32:06.010 --> 32:10.640
It's not like when I was working
at GM out there in Van Nuys.

32:10.723 --> 32:13.851
- This is different here.
- You're part of a team.

32:13.935 --> 32:16.938
What, a team? What are they doing for you?

32:17.021 --> 32:19.899
They spotting for you?
Sending you in plays, huh?

32:19.983 --> 32:22.068
Maybe they got instant replay...

32:22.151 --> 32:25.530
Hey, brother, come on!
These people have been good to me.

32:25.613 --> 32:29.409
Kohai, I'm gonna call in a favor.
Stay here with Mr. Phillips.

32:29.492 --> 32:31.369
Come on, kohai.

32:31.452 --> 32:33.830
- Lieutenant Smith.
- Oh.

33:03.067 --> 33:05.445
Don't fuck with these guys.

33:11.743 --> 33:14.537
Hey, the honeys are out tonight.

33:14.621 --> 33:18.166
Oh, here's a nice one. Let's use the gizmo.

33:18.249 --> 33:20.335
Oh, yeah, she's nice.

33:20.585 --> 33:22.670
Not so nice.

33:23.004 --> 33:25.089
She's my ex-wife.

33:26.507 --> 33:29.010
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

33:29.093 --> 33:31.638
Don't be. She's a lawyer.

33:33.681 --> 33:35.892
It must be nice to fuck a lawyer...

33:35.975 --> 33:38.686
...instead of always being fucked by one.

33:40.647 --> 33:43.650
I've seen your friend
around here quite a bit.

33:43.733 --> 33:45.860
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:45.943 --> 33:48.363
Real friendly with Mr. Yoshida there.

33:48.446 --> 33:50.865
And who's Mr. Yoshida?

33:51.741 --> 33:54.077
Mr. Yoshida's the man!

33:54.160 --> 33:56.245
Let's listen in.

34:00.583 --> 34:02.669
I know nothing of this.

34:02.752 --> 34:05.463
Any recordings we have
are yours to examine.

34:05.546 --> 34:07.632
I will look into it immediately.

34:15.389 --> 34:17.475
What does that mean?

34:17.558 --> 34:20.143
Massa wants me to get the car.

34:28.945 --> 34:33.199
Senator Morton, you said
if the sale of MicroCon is approved...

34:33.283 --> 34:36.661
...they will control the market
and use the technology...

34:36.744 --> 34:39.038
...to compete against our own companies.

34:39.121 --> 34:42.333
You know that there is a time and a place
for business...

34:42.417 --> 34:47.547
...and tonight I just want to say
that our hosts threw one heck of a gala.

34:47.630 --> 34:51.259
But, Senator, you've said,
"Look what happened to our TV industry. "

34:51.342 --> 34:54.929
- Is there such a thing as off-duty?
- Let's wrap it up.

34:55.013 --> 34:57.515
Hey, you! Quit loafing!

34:57.598 --> 34:59.809
Get the Senator's car! We're waiting.

34:59.892 --> 35:02.228
No! You get the Senator's car.

35:02.312 --> 35:05.064
Wrong guy. Wrong fuckin' century.

35:06.107 --> 35:08.609
Penguin-lookin' motherfucker!

35:10.278 --> 35:12.238
Arigato.

35:12.322 --> 35:14.365
Let me smack this asshole.

35:14.449 --> 35:18.494
Captain Connor!
Remember me? Bob Richmond.

35:18.578 --> 35:20.663
Myers, Lawson and Richmond.

35:20.747 --> 35:24.542
I understand my Nakamoto guys
got a little frazzled tonight.

35:24.626 --> 35:27.128
If I can be of any help to you...

35:27.211 --> 35:29.297
...I’m available.

35:29.422 --> 35:31.507
That's comforting.

35:32.050 --> 35:34.135
Asshole!

35:34.218 --> 35:39.098
I knew him when he was a government
trade negotiator dealing with the Japanese.

35:39.182 --> 35:40.683
Now he's working for them.

35:40.767 --> 35:42.852
Like I said... asshole.

36:08.544 --> 36:09.879
Help you?

36:09.963 --> 36:11.965
Cheryl Lynn Austin.

36:12.048 --> 36:14.801
- She not in.
- Yeah, I know.

36:16.177 --> 36:17.845
Keys.

36:27.689 --> 36:30.066
- Room two.
- Arigato.

36:49.168 --> 36:51.254
The doorman's Yakuza.

36:51.337 --> 36:55.216
I noticed his tattoo. I didn't know
there were so many Yakuza in America.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.594
This isn’t America.
This is that shadow world.

36:58.678 --> 37:02.015
They have bars, clubs and... bettaku.

37:03.933 --> 37:09.105
Bettaku. Love residence
where mistresses are kept.

37:09.188 --> 37:11.691
- This is one, huh?
- Correct.

37:11.774 --> 37:13.860
Here we are.

37:22.785 --> 37:25.038
What time did it start raining tonight?

37:25.121 --> 37:27.206
After nine.

37:28.583 --> 37:30.793
Someone was here after nine.

37:32.003 --> 37:34.088
Correct.

38:46.869 --> 38:48.955
Look at this.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.045
She's with Eddie.

38:56.129 --> 38:57.964
You know him?

38:58.047 --> 39:00.258
Mm. Eddie Sakamura.

39:25.783 --> 39:27.660
What's this?

39:32.373 --> 39:36.002
Girlfriend was into some different shit.

39:41.382 --> 39:43.301
Look.

39:43.384 --> 39:48.222
What is with this guy? There's a lot of
pictures of her with your friend Sakamutu.

39:48.306 --> 39:50.391
- Sakamura.
- Whatever.

39:55.647 --> 39:58.983
Somebody's taken photos from here recently.

40:05.657 --> 40:09.202
Oh... I thought I heard Eddie's voice.

40:10.745 --> 40:12.664
Say, um...

40:12.747 --> 40:16.376
- Why is everybody in Cheryl's room tonight?
- Everybody?

40:16.459 --> 40:18.544
Well, you and...

40:18.628 --> 40:21.422
Aren't you just a little bit
off limits here?

40:21.506 --> 40:23.091
And who are you?

40:23.174 --> 40:25.259
Me?

40:26.344 --> 40:28.429
Well, I'm Julia.

40:29.097 --> 40:32.809
I'm just a little neighbor girl
who lives down the hall.

40:32.892 --> 40:34.978
Are you Cheryl's back-door man?

40:35.061 --> 40:37.021
And what if I am?

40:38.064 --> 40:40.149
Well...

40:40.233 --> 40:42.443
If you are...

40:42.527 --> 40:44.612
...mm, I heard of you.

40:45.613 --> 40:49.701
You better watch out
cos Eddie, he's the real jealous type.

40:49.784 --> 40:52.787
They don't call him Crazy Eddie for nothing.

40:52.870 --> 40:55.915
Really? Well, I'm kinda tough.

40:55.999 --> 40:58.084
Mm, well...

40:58.334 --> 41:00.503
...tough as you may be...

41:02.088 --> 41:05.842
...Eddie finds out,
then you're gonna be crying.

41:10.430 --> 41:12.515
Um, say...

41:12.598 --> 41:14.684
...is Cheryl all right?

41:14.767 --> 41:16.853
No, she isn't.

41:17.228 --> 41:19.314
Lieutenant Web Smith. LAPD.

41:21.024 --> 41:24.193
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

41:24.277 --> 41:27.030
I heard him screaming at Cheryl.

41:27.113 --> 41:32.160
Shouting things like, "I'll kill you",
before he took her to that party tonight.

41:33.953 --> 41:37.665
Many thanks, miss.
Someone from my office will contact you.

41:39.709 --> 41:42.795
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

41:44.172 --> 41:45.632
Kohai.

41:47.967 --> 41:50.053
You know, Web...

41:50.136 --> 41:56.059
Eddie's father is a, um...
big industrialist over there at Daimatsu.

41:59.771 --> 42:02.690
He has a, um... a friend he sees.

42:03.691 --> 42:05.652
Jeanette.

42:05.735 --> 42:08.237
Right up here on the second floor.

42:10.615 --> 42:12.909
You know how Eddie met Cheryl?

42:16.079 --> 42:17.997
Well...

42:18.081 --> 42:22.669
...she was working in that Toyota plant
back there in Kentucky.

42:23.586 --> 42:25.672
Then one day...

42:26.506 --> 42:30.969
...who should show up
in that small, little town...

42:32.762 --> 42:34.847
...but Eddie.

42:39.519 --> 42:41.604
Web...

43:08.131 --> 43:11.509
She was about to give up the murderer,
and you just walk away.

43:12.802 --> 43:15.513
Maybe I've been bought off by the Japanese.

43:15.596 --> 43:20.018
Sempai, apple pie, whatever I have
to call you... we have a murder here.

43:20.101 --> 43:22.895
I want to solve it,
not listen to true confessions.

43:22.979 --> 43:25.064
You know what's true?

43:25.148 --> 43:28.901
When something looks too good
to be true, then it's not true.

43:28.985 --> 43:32.155
Everything she said about Eddie
might have been true.

43:32.238 --> 43:34.824
The real question is
why was she saying it?

43:34.907 --> 43:37.201
OK! Why was she saying it?

43:37.285 --> 43:39.245
I'm not sure.

43:40.413 --> 43:43.333
Because she thought
Eddie killed the girl!

43:43.416 --> 43:46.085
This Julia accidentally walked in...

43:46.169 --> 43:49.922
Nothing is happening accidentally.
She's a messenger.

43:51.299 --> 43:54.510
- Oh, you think someone sent her?
- Mm.

43:54.677 --> 43:56.554
OK. Who?

43:56.638 --> 43:58.640
The bad guys.

43:58.723 --> 44:02.185
And I suppose they sent her in
to find out what we know.

44:02.268 --> 44:05.063
Or to tell us what they wanted us to know.

44:05.146 --> 44:07.231
Or maybe to slow us down.

44:08.066 --> 44:10.318
She certainly slowed you down.

44:10.401 --> 44:11.736
Bullshit!

44:11.819 --> 44:14.989
Bullshit?
Never underestimate your opponent.

44:15.073 --> 44:17.659
Never take what he offers you.

44:18.076 --> 44:20.328
You want to solve this crime?

44:20.411 --> 44:22.455
- Yes.
- Well, so do I.

44:22.538 --> 44:23.748
Now let's move.

44:28.252 --> 44:30.338
Come on, Eddie!

44:39.889 --> 44:43.726
Darling, those days are gone from your life.

44:46.187 --> 44:49.732
I could dance like that. I'm an old
song-and-dance man from way back.

44:49.816 --> 44:52.860
Oh, yeah? Wanna teach me some steps?

45:05.331 --> 45:09.877
- It's by invitation only, gentlemen.
- Mr. Sakamura.

45:09.961 --> 45:13.381
- Mr. Sakamura is not here.
- That's him. The bad tap-dancer.

45:14.966 --> 45:17.635
Mr. Sakamura is not available.

45:17.719 --> 45:22.015
Mr. Sakamura is a good friend of mine.
I'm sure he's available for me.

45:22.724 --> 45:26.019
Gentlemen, you're trespassing.

45:26.102 --> 45:30.898
Now, unless you have a search warrant,
you'll have to leave.

45:31.858 --> 45:34.652
You should know I'm a black belt.

45:34.736 --> 45:37.405
- But of course you are, dear.
- Need help, Perry?

45:37.488 --> 45:39.240
So is Jeff.

45:43.161 --> 45:45.663
OK, fellas. You're leaving.

45:48.583 --> 45:50.668
That's assault.

45:51.586 --> 45:53.671
I don't wanna hurt you.

46:00.511 --> 46:05.350
They say if you must resort
to violence, you've already lost.

46:05.433 --> 46:07.352
What do you think, Jeff?

46:07.435 --> 46:10.313
I think I'll go get Mr. Sakamura.

46:14.442 --> 46:17.111
- Ah, Captain Connor!
- Eddie.

46:19.113 --> 46:23.451
My father will be happy to hear
you're still up to your same old tricks.

46:23.534 --> 46:25.620
We're here to talk, Eddie.

46:26.287 --> 46:28.414
So talk. It's a free country.

46:28.498 --> 46:31.834
It's about the murder at Nakamoto tonight.

46:31.918 --> 46:34.212
Well, let's talk outside.

46:40.885 --> 46:43.429
Yeah. I heard about that. Some poor girl.

46:43.513 --> 46:45.390
You know her, Eddie.

46:46.391 --> 46:48.476
Cheryl Austin.

46:48.559 --> 46:51.312
Oh, yeah, Cheryl. Mm. That girl.

46:52.230 --> 46:54.315
Too bad.

46:55.441 --> 46:58.027
I hear she was a real hentai onna.

46:58.111 --> 47:00.071
You knew her better than that.

47:00.154 --> 47:03.032
You're putting her up at the Imperial Arms.

47:03.116 --> 47:06.577
Oh, that Cheryl.
Oh, I know her real well.

47:06.661 --> 47:10.039
- She was all over me, Connor-san.
- You're irresistible.

47:10.123 --> 47:12.208
That's true, but, uh...

47:12.292 --> 47:14.711
Connor-san, she had a big problem.

47:14.794 --> 47:18.506
She was a sick girl. She liked pain.

47:18.589 --> 47:22.885
Put a plastic bag over her head,
always saying, "Squeeze harder. "

47:22.969 --> 47:26.097
Squeeze the neck? You like that, do you?

47:26.180 --> 47:28.266
Me? No!

47:28.349 --> 47:31.185
I'm a straight meat-and-potatoes man.

47:31.269 --> 47:33.646
Don't let 'em see you like this. Get up!

47:33.730 --> 47:37.150
- Did you see her tonight?
- Tonight? Me?

47:37.233 --> 47:40.862
Maybe for two minutes at the party.
Just to say hello.

47:40.945 --> 47:44.073
Mr. Sakamura,
I think you'd better come with us.

47:47.619 --> 47:49.829
Yeah, I saw her tonight.

47:52.498 --> 47:54.709
I brought her to the party.

47:54.792 --> 47:57.378
But I have nothing to do with it.

47:57.462 --> 48:01.424
Look, I can prove it to you.
Just let me call you later.

48:01.507 --> 48:04.093
I will bring you something.

48:04.177 --> 48:07.305
- I think that’s a bad idea.
- Captain.

48:07.388 --> 48:09.641
Nakamoto is keiretsu.

48:09.724 --> 48:12.977
My father is Daimatsu keiretsu.

48:13.061 --> 48:18.274
If his son is arrested here,
there will be repercussions.

48:18.358 --> 48:21.778
Business is war. I know you understand.

48:33.873 --> 48:35.959
Do you have your passport?

48:36.042 --> 48:38.127
Yeah, sure.

48:41.297 --> 48:43.383
Give him your card.

48:43.466 --> 48:45.551
And you call him, Eddie.

48:47.971 --> 48:49.430
Connor-san!

49:01.025 --> 49:04.070
- I sure hope you know what you’re doing.
- Me, too.

49:04.153 --> 49:06.239
He's guilty as hell.

49:06.322 --> 49:08.992
Well, my dairokkan says he's not.

49:09.075 --> 49:11.786
I hope your intuition is right.

49:23.589 --> 49:25.591
Look, sempai...

49:25.675 --> 49:29.846
...my dairokkan tells me your dairokkan
wasn't why you let Eddie go.

49:31.097 --> 49:34.225
In Japan, his father saved my life.

49:35.268 --> 49:37.353
And Eddie reminded you of that?

49:37.437 --> 49:39.606
He would never remind me.

49:39.689 --> 49:42.400
It's my responsibility to remember.

49:42.483 --> 49:45.862
So what is all this bullshit
about his father's keiretsu?

49:45.945 --> 49:48.698
Bullshit? There's a keiretsuwar going on.

49:48.781 --> 49:52.118
A Japanese corporation never stands alone.

49:52.201 --> 49:57.540
A keiretsu is a united front
of hundreds of powerful companies...

49:57.624 --> 50:00.251
...all acting in partnership to win.

50:00.335 --> 50:01.669
To win what?

50:01.753 --> 50:03.838
Whatever's there.

50:03.921 --> 50:06.716
You ever hear "business is war"?

50:07.884 --> 50:09.969
The war is never over.

50:10.053 --> 50:13.306
Maybe you heard
"All's fair in love and war"?

50:13.389 --> 50:15.016
No.

50:15.099 --> 50:17.602
- So where does that leave us?
- Us?

50:19.228 --> 50:21.314
We're in the war zone.

50:38.665 --> 50:43.169
So, based on the lab results,
the guy who fucked her was Japanese.

50:43.252 --> 50:45.338
Semen analysis is blood type AB.

50:45.421 --> 50:49.550
Diego factor positive.
Negative for ethanol dehydrogenase.

50:49.634 --> 50:53.096
Asian pattern.
Male pubic hair also Asian in origin.

50:53.179 --> 50:56.432
Evidence points to a Japanese perpetrator.

50:56.516 --> 50:58.685
It's a Jap perp all right.

51:04.816 --> 51:07.110
Sumimasen... Sumimasen.

51:09.862 --> 51:11.948
What the hell's this?

51:15.785 --> 51:17.870
Looks like your guy confessed.

51:17.954 --> 51:20.373
No. It's just Sumimasen.

51:20.456 --> 51:25.545
If they're caught doing something wrong, to
get leniency, they must perform an apology.

51:25.628 --> 51:28.131
- You mean it's an act?
- Not exactly.

51:28.214 --> 51:31.134
He's genuinely scared
you'll create a scandal.

51:31.217 --> 51:36.180
Yoshida-san insisted that he find
the missing disk and deliver it to us.

51:36.264 --> 51:38.016
Yeah, good luck.

51:38.099 --> 51:41.436
That disk is probably
in a Tokyo landfill by now.

51:47.859 --> 51:49.944
What the hell's this?

51:50.028 --> 51:52.113
Daytime. 46th floor.

51:52.196 --> 51:55.408
Negotiations for MicroCon.
Semiconductors.

51:55.491 --> 51:57.577
Hey, can we skip the cartoons?

51:57.660 --> 51:59.746
Hold on. We're just starting.

52:04.459 --> 52:06.544
Richmond-san. Busy, busy.

52:06.628 --> 52:09.088
Hey, let's go. Get to it!

52:09.172 --> 52:11.674
Ah. Night-time. Same place.

52:12.634 --> 52:14.719
Looks different then.

52:16.471 --> 52:18.556
Jesus! It's her.

52:25.939 --> 52:29.150
Hello.

52:30.026 --> 52:32.111
Come on in.

52:48.503 --> 52:50.588
He looks Japanese.

52:51.422 --> 52:53.508
Maybe he's Polish.

52:57.136 --> 52:59.931
He's checking to see
if she's carrying a gun.

53:00.014 --> 53:02.183
Someone's using the gizmo.

53:02.266 --> 53:04.936
Gizmo. He's sure using it on her.

53:16.739 --> 53:19.325
There go the hands to the neck.

53:19.409 --> 53:21.494
Just the way she likes it.

53:43.725 --> 53:46.311
Hey, Mr. Nice Guy. Turn around.

53:50.148 --> 53:53.443
Oh, no! Don't tell me
he's gonna walk out in the dark.

53:53.860 --> 53:56.279
No! Step into...

53:56.362 --> 53:59.616
There! Back it up!

54:04.162 --> 54:05.830
There.

54:05.913 --> 54:08.291
That's right, I knew it all along.

54:08.374 --> 54:10.627
- I was right about this.
- Eddie.

54:10.710 --> 54:12.754
You know this fucker?

54:12.837 --> 54:14.464
Eddie Sakamura.

54:14.547 --> 54:16.382
We had him tonight.

54:16.466 --> 54:20.470
- What do you mean, you had him?
- We had him. We let him go.

54:21.471 --> 54:25.725
- I kept his passport.
- His fuckin' passport? Jesus!

54:25.808 --> 54:28.269
Get his ass, not his passport!

54:28.353 --> 54:33.316
What are you waiting for? You want banzai
carved on her ass with a samurai sword?

54:33.399 --> 54:36.402
Let's go get this Eddie Sock-it-to-me.

54:36.486 --> 54:40.990
I'm gonna break your arms, my friend.
I'm gonna love breaking them.

54:42.533 --> 54:44.619
Come on, Web!

55:17.026 --> 55:19.195
The old guy sucker punched me.

55:20.113 --> 55:22.490
If I see him again, he's dead meat.

55:22.573 --> 55:24.909
Oh, forget it.

55:34.377 --> 55:37.588
Good evening, Jeff. Mr. Sakamura in?

55:43.761 --> 55:45.847
Easy, big fella.

55:54.355 --> 55:56.524
Just like old times, Web.

55:56.608 --> 55:59.569
Do you miss it? A night out with the boys?

56:00.236 --> 56:04.157
- Sure beats all that diplomacy shit.
- I thought no violence.

56:05.158 --> 56:07.243
Last thing we want.

56:07.327 --> 56:09.829
The guy's a murderer, Spider-san.

56:09.912 --> 56:11.998
LAPD takes no chances.

56:12.081 --> 56:14.709
Yeah, but we do take prisoners. Right?

56:17.879 --> 56:20.131
Why did Connor let this guy walk?

56:20.214 --> 56:22.300
I can't say.

56:22.967 --> 56:25.053
What is he about?

56:25.887 --> 56:28.556
He's always careful not to offend their...

56:28.640 --> 56:31.142
What is it we're not supposed to offend?

56:31.225 --> 56:33.311
Fuck 'em, they break the law.

56:33.394 --> 56:35.897
If that brands me as a reactionary...

56:35.980 --> 56:39.400
- We're in position. Stand by.
- Moving in.

56:40.693 --> 56:43.196
Is reactionary a dirty word?

56:43.279 --> 56:45.365
Like racist, or something like that?

56:45.448 --> 56:49.661
All this talk of race.
Whatever happened to good and evil?

56:49.744 --> 56:51.829
A guy did it, you catch him.

57:43.506 --> 57:46.968
Plundering our natural resources.

57:47.051 --> 57:49.595
Fuckin' guys are into everything!

57:58.980 --> 58:01.065
What time you got, Web?

58:02.233 --> 58:04.319
2:10.

58:04.736 --> 58:09.407
Make a note.
At 2:11, suspect was apprehended.

58:09.490 --> 58:13.411
Eddie Sakamura calling. It's urgent.
I must speak about missing disk.

58:18.875 --> 58:20.960
Police! Get down!

58:23.004 --> 58:24.797
Stay where you are! Get down!

58:24.881 --> 58:26.633
Don't move! Get down!

58:26.716 --> 58:28.801
- You guys, out the back!
- You son of a bitch!

58:28.885 --> 58:30.970
What the hell? Get off of me!

58:31.804 --> 58:33.389
There he goes!

58:33.473 --> 58:35.475
Ow, shit!

58:35.558 --> 58:37.769
What the hell is wrong with you? Get off!

58:38.770 --> 58:41.064
You're nuts! Get off of me!

58:41.397 --> 58:43.483
Get that son of a bitch!

58:46.486 --> 58:49.989
- I'm a police officer!
- You're a piece of shit!

59:29.195 --> 59:31.281
8- Adam-65.

59:31.364 --> 59:33.533
I'm in pursuit of 187 suspect,
eastbound, Sunset.

59:35.785 --> 59:40.373
All units, stand by.
8- Adam-65 in pursuit eastbound...

59:42.959 --> 59:45.962
8- Adam-65, what is your location?

59:51.634 --> 59:53.928
Stay back, I want him alive.

59:54.846 --> 59:56.931
Holy shit!

01:00:04.897 --> 01:00:06.983
Damn! Damn, damn, damn!

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.821
Coroner's officials have taken possession...

01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:15.533
...of the charred remains
identified as Mr. Edward Sakamura.

01:00:15.617 --> 01:00:17.535
The crash took place after...

01:00:17.619 --> 01:00:19.912
We tried to take him, but he ran, Chief.

01:00:19.996 --> 01:00:23.833
Burnt beyond recognition.
The guy's a cinder.

01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:26.711
You got proof that Sakamura
committed the murder?

01:00:26.794 --> 01:00:31.049
- Absolutely. Got it all recorded. Right?
- Absolutely.

01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:34.093
You did everything by the book?

01:00:34.177 --> 01:00:36.429
By the book. Absolutely, Chief.

01:00:37.388 --> 01:00:39.474
Absolutely.

01:00:39.557 --> 01:00:42.894
But everything was not
absolutely by the book.

01:00:44.437 --> 01:00:46.522
Absolutely not.

01:00:46.606 --> 01:00:49.525
And when did you discover this?

01:01:04.415 --> 01:01:05.500
Yeah.

01:01:05.583 --> 01:01:07.585
- Lieutenant Smith?
- Yeah.

01:01:07.669 --> 01:01:10.380
This is division dispatcher.
Uncleared messages.

01:01:10.463 --> 01:01:14.050
- All right, go ahead.
- 5:27am, Captain Connor.

01:01:14.133 --> 01:01:16.177
Oh, Connor.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.764
He said to give you a
wake-up call at seven...

01:01:19.847 --> 01:01:22.642
...and to meet him at
the golf club at 9:15am.

01:01:22.725 --> 01:01:24.894
All right, all right. Anything else?

01:01:24.978 --> 01:01:27.063
Let's see... Nope.

01:01:27.146 --> 01:01:28.856
What about last night?

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.651
You got all your messages last night.

01:01:31.734 --> 01:01:33.820
No, I didn't call in last night.

01:01:33.903 --> 01:01:35.989
Yeah, you did.

01:01:36.281 --> 01:01:38.366
Let's see, uh... yep.

01:01:39.784 --> 01:01:44.122
2:33. Your clearance number was given
and messages were transmitted.

01:01:44.205 --> 01:01:47.000
Um... Look, I forgot.

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:50.211
Can you give those messages to me again?

01:01:50.295 --> 01:01:52.422
All right, just a sec.

01:01:52.505 --> 01:01:54.799
What were you doing last night?!

01:01:54.882 --> 01:01:56.676
Uh...

01:01:56.759 --> 01:01:59.512
- Sort of helping my career.
- Is that good?

01:01:59.595 --> 01:02:01.639
Yeah. It's always good.

01:02:01.723 --> 01:02:04.225
Cos you gotta look out
for yourself in life.

01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:07.228
Grandma says you gotta look out
for other people.

01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:10.231
Yeah. Well, you gotta do that, too.

01:02:10.315 --> 01:02:13.109
That's why everybody's so busy all the time.

01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:16.446
So, is that what business is?

01:02:16.529 --> 01:02:17.947
Business?

01:02:18.031 --> 01:02:21.034
No, business... Business is uh...

01:02:24.996 --> 01:02:27.081
Business is... is...

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:30.126
I can't explain it to you right now.

01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:33.129
Is that why Mommy says
you've no head for business?

01:02:33.212 --> 01:02:35.381
- Lieutenant Smith? Here we go.
- Yeah.

01:02:35.465 --> 01:02:39.052
Daddy? Why does Mommy call you a loser?

01:02:39.135 --> 01:02:41.220
Out!

01:02:41.304 --> 01:02:45.934
Ken Shubik, please call. Message reads,
"The Weasel's checking up on you. "

01:02:46.017 --> 01:02:47.894
- The Weasel?
- Yeah.

01:02:47.977 --> 01:02:50.980
Then 2:10 this morning,
Mr. Eddie Sakamura...

01:02:51.648 --> 01:02:54.150
- Eddie Sakamura?
- Correct.

01:02:54.233 --> 01:02:58.071
2:10 am. Message reads,
"Urgent. Must speak about missing disk. "

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.506
Nice shot!

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.771
Hey! I gotta talk to you!

01:03:33.648 --> 01:03:35.024
We gotta have a conversation.

01:03:35.108 --> 01:03:37.193
Ooh! Shit! Whoa, whoa!

01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:44.534
Yoshida-san. I'm embarrassed
by this crude interruption.

01:03:44.617 --> 01:03:46.703
You must play your stroke again.

01:03:46.786 --> 01:03:48.871
No penalty.

01:03:53.793 --> 01:03:56.087
- Ken Shubik.
- Hey, Ken! Web Smith.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:59.007
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah, about the Weasel.

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:01.968
Last night, I'm working late at the paper...

01:04:02.051 --> 01:04:04.554
I see the Weasel arrive, dressed in his tux.

01:04:04.637 --> 01:04:06.723
He goes right to the library.

01:04:06.806 --> 01:04:09.976
I could tell the ambitious turd
had the scent of blood.

01:04:10.059 --> 01:04:11.436
He's still here.

01:04:11.519 --> 01:04:14.897
I ask the librarian what he's checking out.

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:17.984
She says, "A cop named Web Smith. "

01:04:18.067 --> 01:04:22.363
- What?
- Yep. The guy's a scumbag for hire.

01:04:22.447 --> 01:04:25.950
He used to do jobs
for the studios and realtors.

01:04:26.034 --> 01:04:30.204
The little turd just got
a new Mercedes 500SL.

01:04:30.288 --> 01:04:33.541
Pretty good on a reporter's salary.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:36.419
Wonder who he's working for now?

01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:39.672
You get on the wrong side
of somebody last night?

01:04:39.756 --> 01:04:42.634
- Maybe.
- Somebody's got the Weasel tracking you.

01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:45.345
Something about
a charge brought against you.

01:04:45.428 --> 01:04:49.724
- A charge brought against me?
- You and a Lieutenant Tom Graham.

01:04:49.807 --> 01:04:52.268
At the hearing I was cleared.
It was bullshit!

01:04:52.352 --> 01:04:54.896
Maybe so,
but I thought you’d better know.

01:04:54.979 --> 01:04:58.066
Smells like something heavy coming down.

01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:05.323
What happened to the disk? We left it
with you when we went to get Eddie.

01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:08.785
And you got Eddie.
Oh, yes. It was all over the paper.

01:05:08.868 --> 01:05:13.456
There was no mention of the murdered girl
on the boardroom table, right?

01:05:13.539 --> 01:05:16.834
You had the disk.
It is against the rules to take evidence.

01:05:16.918 --> 01:05:18.836
The rules?

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.546
Whose rules?

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.507
The rules!

01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:24.676
The chief says we fucked up...

01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:28.763
The Japanese have a saying.
"Fix the problem, not the blame. "

01:05:28.846 --> 01:05:31.224
Find out what's fucked up and fix it.

01:05:31.307 --> 01:05:35.645
Nobody gets blamed.
We're always after who fucked up.

01:05:35.728 --> 01:05:37.689
Their way's better.

01:05:37.772 --> 01:05:38.731
Oh!

01:05:38.815 --> 01:05:41.651
Their way is better?
You wake me up to tell me that?

01:05:41.734 --> 01:05:44.445
Wake you up? That'll be the day.

01:05:50.118 --> 01:05:53.246
Keep it, sport.
Next time, try a parking meter.

01:05:54.205 --> 01:05:56.332
- Captain Connor?
- Yes.

01:05:56.416 --> 01:05:58.501
A gift from Mr. Hanada.

01:05:58.584 --> 01:06:00.962
Oh! Thank you. I appreciate it.

01:06:01.045 --> 01:06:03.298
Most welcome. Most welcome.

01:06:08.386 --> 01:06:11.514
You must have really
took those guys this morning.

01:06:11.598 --> 01:06:13.683
No. I lost.

01:06:13.766 --> 01:06:16.561
Lost? Guys didn't look all that good.

01:06:16.644 --> 01:06:18.730
Oh, they're not.

01:06:18.813 --> 01:06:22.150
It's difficult to lose
without making it too obvious.

01:06:22.233 --> 01:06:25.278
- That way they don't lose face.
- Saving face.

01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:27.822
Sounds more to me
like you were kissing ass.

01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:31.492
Not exactly. I've done services
for those men in the past.

01:06:31.576 --> 01:06:34.078
And we've shared information.

01:06:34.162 --> 01:06:38.082
They said that Eddie's death
will have repercussions.

01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:39.584
Yeah, right!

01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:43.630
I'm sorry. The guy was a fugitive.
He killed the girl.

01:06:43.713 --> 01:06:46.090
- I doubt it.
- You doubt it?

01:06:46.174 --> 01:06:48.343
Well, I saw it on the disk.

01:06:48.426 --> 01:06:50.511
Did you?

01:06:59.228 --> 01:07:01.731
It's the only space available to us.

01:07:01.814 --> 01:07:06.402
We analyze commercials and network news
to see how the public's being tricked.

01:07:06.486 --> 01:07:10.907
Problem is, most students want to learn the
tricks so they can use them to get ahead.

01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:13.076
OK, everybody!

01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:15.161
Class is over.

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:18.790
Ice-skating rink upstairs.
The ice melts down here.

01:07:18.873 --> 01:07:23.336
Speaking of ice, Captain, she's been at it
since you gave her the disk at 3am.

01:07:23.419 --> 01:07:27.340
Jingo Asakuma...
meet Lieutenant Web Smith.

01:07:28.299 --> 01:07:30.468
You're late.

01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:32.845
What have we got?

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.057
Something there.

01:07:37.558 --> 01:07:39.644
In the edge colors.

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:44.607
Look at shadow lines.
They added some shadows.

01:07:44.691 --> 01:07:46.776
Look at the light source.

01:07:48.361 --> 01:07:51.030
We can see her face, but we can't see his.

01:07:51.114 --> 01:07:54.033
- Perfect job, though.
- And what else?

01:07:54.117 --> 01:07:55.994
The reflection.

01:07:56.077 --> 01:07:58.746
- Of Eddie.
- It's fishy.

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:02.125
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:04.294
Oh. Here we are.

01:08:06.379 --> 01:08:09.882
Let's look at the color shift in the pixels.

01:08:09.966 --> 01:08:12.760
Yeah. Let's look at those pixels.

01:08:16.014 --> 01:08:18.349
Pixels have been doctored.

01:08:18.433 --> 01:08:20.518
See the blue edge?

01:08:20.602 --> 01:08:23.813
- This disk's a copy.
- A copy? Wait a minute.

01:08:23.895 --> 01:08:28.443
You're saying somebody put Eddie's face
there and it's not his reflection?

01:08:28.526 --> 01:08:30.612
Come on, that's bullshit!

01:08:30.694 --> 01:08:35.742
Bullshit? Where have you been, Lieutenant?
You don't think video can be altered?

01:08:35.825 --> 01:08:39.203
I want you to watch what I've been recording
on that camera.

01:08:56.845 --> 01:09:02.352
This is quick and crude, but imagine the
effect with more sophisticated equipment.

01:09:02.435 --> 01:09:04.312
Watch this.

01:09:04.395 --> 01:09:09.359
You're saying somebody put Eddie's face
there and it's not his reflection?

01:09:09.442 --> 01:09:11.527
Come on, that's bullshit!

01:09:12.612 --> 01:09:14.279
Hm!

01:09:14.363 --> 01:09:18.242
- They'd need photos of this man.
- They have photos of Eddie.

01:09:18.326 --> 01:09:21.162
From the dead girl's apartment.
Off the mirror.

01:09:21.245 --> 01:09:23.383
Do you believe in ghosts,
Lieutenant Smith?

01:09:23.584 --> 01:09:25.584
What do you mean,
do I believe in ghosts?

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:28.836
In Japan, when I was growing up,
we believed in many ghosts.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.046
I want you to watch this.

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.549
Tell me what you see.

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:38.388
See it?

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:40.139
- See what?
- Yeah.

01:09:40.223 --> 01:09:42.433
Play it again... but slowly.

01:09:42.517 --> 01:09:45.645
The way to see it is
to move slightly faster.

01:09:52.234 --> 01:09:54.194
It's a ghost!

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.448
- Look at that! It's a ghost!
- A third person.

01:09:57.532 --> 01:10:01.035
- It's been systematically erased.
- Erased?

01:10:01.119 --> 01:10:04.872
Just like airbrushing someone
out of a still, only much harder.

01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:08.376
It pisses me off, though.

01:10:08.459 --> 01:10:11.671
They expect us to be sloppy Americans.

01:10:11.754 --> 01:10:15.216
They think we will not be thorough,
not be intelligent.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.593
In Japan, I guess they'd have done it right.

01:10:18.303 --> 01:10:20.972
Right. The ghost would have stayed hidden.

01:10:21.055 --> 01:10:24.100
To do this, they would need
high-res video stills...

01:10:24.183 --> 01:10:26.769
...close-ups of the table,
anything in the area.

01:10:26.853 --> 01:10:29.480
They'd have to duplicate
the ghost's walk.

01:10:29.564 --> 01:10:33.359
Like someone walking through the room,
shooting photographs?

01:10:33.443 --> 01:10:35.528
- The security guy.
- Tanaka.

01:10:35.612 --> 01:10:38.906
He was walking backwards
through the room taking pictures.

01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:41.284
Wait. Here's something.

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:43.536
Look, there in the glass.

01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:48.207
Our ghost has left a reflection.

01:10:50.084 --> 01:10:54.047
I'm adjusting image resolution
and sharpening.

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:57.302
If I apply an edge
detection operation,

01:10:57.303 --> 01:10:59.303
I should be able to
isolate the reflection...

01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:01.471
...and pull out its shape.

01:11:06.309 --> 01:11:10.939
Let's... adjust resolution and...

01:11:11.022 --> 01:11:14.150
...magnitude of each of the color channels.

01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:34.504
Let's filter out all the noise
we picked up along the way.

01:11:44.305 --> 01:11:46.391
Holy shit.

01:11:47.016 --> 01:11:49.102
Eddie Sakamura.

01:11:49.185 --> 01:11:51.479
Then he witnessed the murder.

01:11:51.562 --> 01:11:54.649
How many hours
did they have to work on these?

01:11:54.732 --> 01:11:58.027
- I got my call at...
- The murder took place 8:30 pm.

01:11:58.111 --> 01:12:01.698
- Ishihara delivered the disk to us, 1:33am.
- Five hours.

01:12:01.781 --> 01:12:03.950
I doubt it could be done.

01:12:04.033 --> 01:12:06.160
If it could be done...

01:12:06.244 --> 01:12:08.413
...where would it be done?

01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:23.219
- It's quiet.
- Hardly anyone's in yet.

01:12:23.303 --> 01:12:26.598
They were working late
last night on a rush project.

01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:29.267
I'm sure Nakamoto
appreciates the hard work.

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:32.270
Yes. I heard it went real well for them.

01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:35.898
Mr. Donaldson is expecting you.

01:12:35.982 --> 01:12:40.612
Yes. We did some work together
when this was the Donaldson Corporation.

01:12:42.947 --> 01:12:45.450
- Jim, how are you?
- Captain Connor.

01:12:45.658 --> 01:12:47.660
- Web Smith.
- Hello.

01:12:47.744 --> 01:12:51.289
- What can I do for you?
- Well, we need your help, Jim.

01:12:51.372 --> 01:12:53.249
Anything.

01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:57.253
You worked on some disks last night
for Nakamoto.

01:12:57.337 --> 01:12:59.464
Some disks? Oh, I doubt that.

01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:02.258
You did. And I need their names.

01:13:03.009 --> 01:13:05.011
Our clients are confidential.

01:13:05.094 --> 01:13:07.889
I know, but er... we do need your help.

01:13:07.972 --> 01:13:11.017
Captain, we wouldn't have done
any work for Nakamoto here.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:16.064
You know damn well Nakamoto
and Hamaguri are competing keiretsu.

01:13:16.147 --> 01:13:19.776
Yes, but I've been told
by reliable sources...

01:13:19.859 --> 01:13:25.281
...that only you have the next generation
of technology to do this kind of work.

01:13:25.448 --> 01:13:27.533
Your reliable sources are wrong.

01:13:27.617 --> 01:13:31.245
Besides, we're way beyond
the next generation here.

01:13:31.329 --> 01:13:33.665
And I really don't know anything.

01:13:33.748 --> 01:13:37.418
- You still run this place, don’t you?
- Run it? Sure.

01:13:37.502 --> 01:13:40.922
I'm still the chief
executive here... sort of.

01:13:41.214 --> 01:13:44.258
Actually, my role is a little different now.

01:13:44.342 --> 01:13:46.386
You mean you don't run it?

01:13:46.469 --> 01:13:49.973
Look, we sold it. They own it.

01:13:50.056 --> 01:13:53.518
People who own things are entitled
to do whatever they want with them.

01:13:53.601 --> 01:13:55.687
That's the way it works.

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:59.274
But, hey, you know...
There's a bright side to everything.

01:13:59.357 --> 01:14:02.151
I'm getting out
to a lot more Dodger games lately.

01:14:02.235 --> 01:14:04.696
Having some fun. You know what I'm saying.

01:14:04.779 --> 01:14:06.864
Yes, I do, Jim.

01:14:06.948 --> 01:14:08.866
Fine.

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:11.369
Best regards to Mrs. Donaldson.

01:14:11.452 --> 01:14:13.913
How's uh... what's her name?

01:14:13.997 --> 01:14:15.999
She's fine.

01:14:16.082 --> 01:14:18.418
- Give her my best!
- I will.

01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:25.925
- So... what do we know now?
- Well, we know the disk was doctored here.

01:14:26.009 --> 01:14:29.387
And we know that they know that we know.

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:32.265
We're beating the grass
to startle the snakes.

01:14:32.849 --> 01:14:36.603
What? Look, where are you from, sempai?

01:14:36.686 --> 01:14:40.231
- Scotland Yard?
- No. Scotland back yard.

01:14:40.773 --> 01:14:44.485
So how did you become
the special liaison officer for Los Angeles?

01:14:44.569 --> 01:14:46.654
And uh... who is "what's-her-name"?

01:14:46.738 --> 01:14:51.534
What you should be asking is
why you and I were put together last night.

01:14:51.618 --> 01:14:54.912
- I was on duty. Nakamoto requested you.
- No, they didn't.

01:14:54.996 --> 01:14:58.750
Nakamoto is formally protesting
the fact that I'm on the case.

01:14:59.334 --> 01:15:01.794
You're saying someone else called you in.

01:15:01.878 --> 01:15:04.756
- Someone who...
- Has been manipulating things.

01:15:04.839 --> 01:15:08.468
We're playing that most American of games.

01:15:08.551 --> 01:15:09.802
Which is what?

01:15:09.886 --> 01:15:11.804
Catch up.

01:15:30.907 --> 01:15:35.495
My golfer friends also said
that Eddie's people might retaliate.

01:15:36.871 --> 01:15:39.707
Eddie's people might retaliate? Against who?

01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:42.710
Whoever they feel
was responsible for his death.

01:15:42.794 --> 01:15:45.046
What do mean when you say retaliate?

01:15:45.129 --> 01:15:48.841
- I shouldn't say any more.
- But you’ve been talking all morning!

01:15:48.925 --> 01:15:51.844
I just realized
they may have bugged your car.

01:15:51.928 --> 01:15:53.179
They? Who's they?

01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.977
Let's move!

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:16.286
- We're the cops! Why are we running?
- We're not running. We're eluding.

01:16:17.203 --> 01:16:19.080
Eluding.

01:16:45.857 --> 01:16:47.942
We're safe around here.

01:16:48.026 --> 01:16:50.111
You call this safe?

01:16:50.194 --> 01:16:53.448
Rough neighborhoods
may be America's last advantage.

01:16:55.283 --> 01:16:57.785
Perhaps I may suggest a strategy.

01:16:58.369 --> 01:17:01.289
Don't stare at these guys.
Keep your hands down.

01:17:01.372 --> 01:17:03.708
These guys don't like big arm movements.

01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:05.585
They might shoot you.

01:17:05.668 --> 01:17:08.713
Keep your voice calm...
Better still, don't say shit.

01:17:08.796 --> 01:17:11.674
If you hear me say
"Can I be of any assistance?"...

01:17:11.758 --> 01:17:15.011
...it's too late.
You can kiss your little ass goodbye.

01:17:17.513 --> 01:17:19.223
Hey, yo! What's up?

01:17:20.099 --> 01:17:23.436
Spider? Spider Web Smith
scored 40 against Crenshaw.

01:17:23.519 --> 01:17:24.562
48.

01:17:24.646 --> 01:17:27.440
- Yo, motherfucker. What year was that?
- '75.

01:17:27.523 --> 01:17:30.777
- Was that before Columbus or after?
- Very funny.

01:17:35.323 --> 01:17:37.825
- Armani?
- Yeah.

01:17:37.909 --> 01:17:39.577
Giorgio!

01:17:39.661 --> 01:17:41.746
You be doin' just fine, brother!

01:17:41.829 --> 01:17:45.041
Look, I'm escorting this old geezer
back to the loony farm.

01:17:45.124 --> 01:17:47.293
He stole sushi from some Japanese cats.

01:17:47.377 --> 01:17:51.339
Now they chasin' us.
So I need you guys to get behind us.

01:17:51.422 --> 01:17:53.508
Think you can help us out?

01:17:55.009 --> 01:17:57.095
We got your back.

01:18:19.659 --> 01:18:21.953
Hey! You guys lookin' for something?

01:18:33.715 --> 01:18:36.551
- Do your window, sir?
- Yeah, OK.

01:18:38.094 --> 01:18:40.054
You got your pink slip?

01:18:40.138 --> 01:18:42.223
Why pink slip?

01:18:42.307 --> 01:18:45.768
Because I was led to believe
this car would be for sale...

01:18:45.852 --> 01:18:47.270
...soon.

01:18:56.696 --> 01:19:00.074
- Senator Morton's campaign office.
- Senator Morton, please.

01:19:00.158 --> 01:19:03.077
- Who's calling?
- Captain Connor returning his call.

01:19:03.161 --> 01:19:04.662
And there he goes.

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:14.589
What's wrong with this picture?

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.637
- The clock isn't moving.
- Exactly.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.598
After the guy leaves, time stands still.

01:19:23.681 --> 01:19:26.601
What they probably did here
was rock and roll.

01:19:26.684 --> 01:19:31.272
Print the same scene over and over
to keep the pixels - the grain - alive.

01:19:31.356 --> 01:19:35.777
They removed what came after this guy's exit
and that made the disks the standard length.

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:39.572
So no-one would suspect
anything was missing after that. But...

01:19:39.656 --> 01:19:41.741
Something happened after that.

01:19:41.824 --> 01:19:45.995
If we only had the original disk,
we could see what happened after that.

01:19:46.079 --> 01:19:47.538
Exactly.

01:19:47.622 --> 01:19:50.041
You catch on fast, Lieutenant Smith.

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.835
Web.

01:19:53.127 --> 01:19:55.004
Yeah, I do.

01:19:57.006 --> 01:19:59.717
I should go and make
a copy of the disk for you.

01:20:09.352 --> 01:20:11.020
Miss Asakuma...

01:20:11.104 --> 01:20:13.189
- Jingo.
- Jingo.

01:20:13.273 --> 01:20:15.733
How do you feel about working with us?

01:20:15.817 --> 01:20:17.902
I mean the police.

01:20:17.986 --> 01:20:21.572
- Especially since you're...
- You mean... because I'm Japanese.

01:20:23.157 --> 01:20:24.826
Yeah.

01:20:26.494 --> 01:20:28.579
Here I'm Japanese.

01:20:29.789 --> 01:20:32.083
But in Japan, I was ainoku.

01:20:35.128 --> 01:20:37.213
My father was a kokujin.

01:20:37.297 --> 01:20:39.048
You know that word, kokujin?

01:20:39.132 --> 01:20:41.217
- Negro?
- Negro.

01:20:41.301 --> 01:20:43.469
Oh, yes. I know that word.

01:20:43.553 --> 01:20:45.722
Yes, a Black man.

01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:51.894
He was with the American Air Force.

01:20:52.312 --> 01:20:55.231
My mother worked in a noodle shop.

01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:58.276
Do you know the term...

01:20:58.901 --> 01:21:01.029
..."he's a bit burakumin"?

01:21:01.112 --> 01:21:03.197
It's like uh...

01:21:03.781 --> 01:21:05.783
Untouchable.

01:21:05.867 --> 01:21:08.453
I was even lower than burakumin...

01:21:09.162 --> 01:21:11.247
...because I was deformed.

01:21:11.331 --> 01:21:14.876
To the Japanese, deformity is shameful.

01:21:14.959 --> 01:21:17.795
It means you've done something wrong.

01:21:19.422 --> 01:21:21.507
And then on top of all that...

01:21:21.591 --> 01:21:23.676
...I really did something wrong.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.845
And what was that?

01:21:27.513 --> 01:21:29.682
I fell in love with a gaijin.

01:21:29.766 --> 01:21:32.268
A Caucasian who was living there.

01:21:32.352 --> 01:21:34.520
We were both ostracized.

01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:40.318
Made his work over there difficult
and my life impossible.

01:21:40.401 --> 01:21:42.445
He had to leave Japan.

01:21:42.528 --> 01:21:44.405
He left you?

01:21:44.489 --> 01:21:47.408
- Maybe we left each other.
- No.

01:21:47.492 --> 01:21:49.160
He ran out.

01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:51.037
He couldn't take it.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.206
Him?

01:21:53.665 --> 01:21:56.042
No, he could take anything.

01:21:56.626 --> 01:21:59.337
My friend is a very strange man.

01:22:00.004 --> 01:22:02.090
You know what he says?

01:22:02.465 --> 01:22:05.468
Always leave the cage door open...

01:22:06.010 --> 01:22:08.304
...so the bird can return.

01:22:09.722 --> 01:22:12.267
Your friend sounds like an idiot.

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:14.435
Let's go, kohai. We're late.

01:22:16.145 --> 01:22:18.439
And bring the disk.

01:22:25.488 --> 01:22:27.573
Thank you.

01:22:35.456 --> 01:22:37.458
Your pal took the disk.

01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:41.004
- Anyway, we got the right guy.
- Maybe we got the wrong guy.

01:22:41.087 --> 01:22:43.965
What are you talking about?
The case is closed.

01:22:44.048 --> 01:22:47.135
Just relax. Go home, get some sleep.
Slow down.

01:22:47.218 --> 01:22:49.304
Fuck you, slow down.

01:22:50.179 --> 01:22:52.265
- They're squeezing me.
- Who?

01:22:52.348 --> 01:22:54.934
- Who?
- Yeah, who's squeezing you?

01:22:56.894 --> 01:22:58.354
Come on, now. Wake up.

01:22:58.438 --> 01:23:01.149
These aren't the old days.
Just get me that disk...

01:23:01.232 --> 01:23:04.319
...and the case is closed,
just how everybody wants it to be.

01:23:06.487 --> 01:23:09.449
There's your disk.
Go make everybody happy.

01:23:09.532 --> 01:23:11.618
You close the case.

01:23:11.701 --> 01:23:13.786
What are you gonna do?

01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:15.955
I'm opening it up.

01:23:16.706 --> 01:23:18.291
What?

01:23:18.374 --> 01:23:21.711
Oh, what am I?
Endangering my chances for advancement?

01:23:24.714 --> 01:23:26.799
Baby, if you only knew.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.489
Five Japanese nationals inspecting
the remains of last night's car wreck.

01:23:49.572 --> 01:23:53.159
The guys from Nakamoto.
What are they looking for?

01:23:53.242 --> 01:23:55.328
An interesting question.

01:23:55.411 --> 01:23:57.497
Do you recognize the pick-up truck?

01:23:57.956 --> 01:23:59.832
Yeah.

01:23:59.916 --> 01:24:02.627
It was outside Eddie's last night,
by the Cadillac.

01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:05.171
It looked suspicious,
so we had it brought in.

01:24:07.548 --> 01:24:10.093
There's the ownership of the Toyota.

01:24:11.177 --> 01:24:13.263
Tanaka?

01:24:13.346 --> 01:24:14.806
Yeah.

01:24:16.641 --> 01:24:18.851
Head of Nakamoto security.

01:24:18.935 --> 01:24:22.522
Now, what was Tanaka doing
at Eddie's last night?

01:24:26.985 --> 01:24:28.444
Hey, Lieutenant Smith!

01:24:28.528 --> 01:24:30.863
Willy Wilhelm, LA Times. How's it going?

01:24:30.947 --> 01:24:33.032
- Pretty busy right now.
- I understand.

01:24:33.116 --> 01:24:36.244
We're preparing a story on you
about the Martino case.

01:24:36.327 --> 01:24:40.540
The accusation of accepting a bribe
brought against you by Mr. Martino?

01:24:40.623 --> 01:24:42.500
- Any comment?
- No comment.

01:24:42.583 --> 01:24:45.962
Lieutenant Graham made some
interesting comments. Wanna hear them?

01:24:46.045 --> 01:24:46.881
No.

01:24:46.882 --> 01:24:48.882
The DA's office is about to reopen the case.

01:24:48.965 --> 01:24:50.383
- No comment?
- No!

01:24:50.466 --> 01:24:54.429
Captain Connor, what about the charge
of Japan-bashing in tonight's paper?

01:24:54.512 --> 01:24:55.805
Hey!

01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:58.016
Hey? Hay is for horses.

01:24:58.099 --> 01:25:01.311
What is Japan-bashing? What does it mean?

01:25:01.394 --> 01:25:04.522
All animals are created equal
except the Japanese?

01:25:04.606 --> 01:25:07.066
You stupid little shit! Fuck off!

01:25:07.483 --> 01:25:09.569
Can I quote you on that, sir?

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.739
Japan-bashing? You?

01:25:12.822 --> 01:25:16.200
- What'll they think of next?
- Next?

01:25:16.284 --> 01:25:18.453
Next they'll call you a racist.

01:25:22.999 --> 01:25:25.084
Look. I've told you.

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:28.296
I have no idea where Mr. Tanaka is.

01:25:28.379 --> 01:25:30.465
I haven't seen him.

01:25:30.548 --> 01:25:33.301
- But did he come in today?
- I don't know.

01:25:33.593 --> 01:25:37.430
And even if I did know,
the answer is "I don't know. "

01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:39.432
Well, someone knows.

01:25:39.515 --> 01:25:43.394
You guys'll never beat 'em.
They're too good.

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:52.737
I've told you this in order
to avoid unnecessary embarrassment.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:56.032
I am surprised to hear this, Connor-san.

01:25:56.115 --> 01:26:00.203
Because, personally,
I welcome your involvement.

01:26:00.286 --> 01:26:02.372
I know that you're always...

01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:08.002
- Discreet.
- Ah, yes.

01:26:09.003 --> 01:26:11.089
You ask me about MicroCon.

01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:15.093
We were approached in Tokyo last year
by Richmond-san.

01:26:15.176 --> 01:26:18.429
And I'll tell you,
MicroCon needed a shot in the arm.

01:26:18.513 --> 01:26:22.600
So I thought that Nakamoto
would be just what the doctor ordered.

01:26:26.813 --> 01:26:28.898
Excuse me.

01:26:29.691 --> 01:26:31.776
Go on, sir.

01:26:34.404 --> 01:26:37.615
Frankly, we were surprised
it would be offered.

01:26:37.699 --> 01:26:41.661
We were cautious
to enter into negotiations.

01:26:41.744 --> 01:26:47.625
We received assurances that there would be
no objection to the sale from Washington.

01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:54.424
We have been criticized for trying
to help a company in financial difficulty.

01:26:54.966 --> 01:26:57.051
We feel very...

01:26:57.135 --> 01:26:59.470
...kitsu-tsuita.

01:26:59.554 --> 01:27:02.140
- Wounded. Yes.
- Yes.

01:27:23.953 --> 01:27:26.247
- That's bullshit, but...
- Life goes on.

01:27:26.331 --> 01:27:28.583
I remember when computers were fun.

01:27:28.958 --> 01:27:30.001
Hey, guys!

01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:34.464
See you back up there.
Let's get this deal closed.

01:27:34.547 --> 01:27:36.633
So, anyway...

01:27:37.425 --> 01:27:40.553
- Not much team spirit.
- They'll get into it.

01:27:40.637 --> 01:27:44.766
Especially now since they know
Senator Morton is changing his vote.

01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:48.978
He's been convinced his stand is racist.

01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:51.814
- Racist?
- What else could it be?

01:27:51.898 --> 01:27:55.735
Remember when Fujitsu tried
to buy Fairchild Semiconductor?

01:27:55.818 --> 01:28:00.114
The US government blocked the sale
saying it was against national security...

01:28:00.198 --> 01:28:02.033
...to sell it to a foreign company.

01:28:02.116 --> 01:28:04.911
Then later Fairchild is sold
to a French company.

01:28:04.994 --> 01:28:08.915
This time there's not a peep from
Congress, Senator Morton, or anyone.

01:28:08.998 --> 01:28:11.793
Apparently, it was OK
to sell to a foreign company.

01:28:11.876 --> 01:28:13.878
Just not a Japanese company.

01:28:13.962 --> 01:28:16.422
I'd say that's racist policy,
pure and simple.

01:28:16.506 --> 01:28:17.757
Captain Connor.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.969
Nakamoto is an honorable company.

01:28:21.177 --> 01:28:26.474
We have no part in any...
complications that have occurred.

01:28:26.849 --> 01:28:31.062
But if they don't want Japan to buy it,
don't sell it.

01:28:32.063 --> 01:28:36.234
- I will assist you in whatever way I can.
- I'm very grateful.

01:28:36.317 --> 01:28:38.611
Tomorrow at noon for golf?

01:28:39.279 --> 01:28:41.197
Tomorrow at noon.

01:28:42.532 --> 01:28:46.494
I will try to make it harder
for you to let me win.

01:28:56.504 --> 01:28:59.924
Senator. Are you comfortable
with this new position?

01:29:00.008 --> 01:29:04.596
Absolutely.
Because I don’t view it as a new position.

01:29:04.679 --> 01:29:06.764
I view it as a modification...

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.642
That's exactly what it is. A modification.

01:29:09.726 --> 01:29:13.354
The response has been ten to one
in favor of the way I've...

01:29:13.438 --> 01:29:15.231
...modified my position.

01:29:15.315 --> 01:29:17.400
Modified? It's a total reversal.

01:29:17.483 --> 01:29:19.569
Oh, no. Not at all.

01:29:20.528 --> 01:29:24.240
It's simply a...
refinement of my earlier views.

01:29:24.324 --> 01:29:27.035
Foreign trade invigorates America.

01:29:27.118 --> 01:29:29.996
I've always been a
proponent of fair trade...

01:29:30.079 --> 01:29:33.833
But you were against the sale
because it put our advanced weaponry...

01:29:33.916 --> 01:29:35.960
...in the control of the Japanese.

01:29:36.044 --> 01:29:38.755
Now, that's... really vastly simplified.

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:42.634
Ah! More affirmations.

01:29:43.343 --> 01:29:47.013
Oh, Senator Shanley.
It must have killed him to write this!

01:29:47.096 --> 01:29:49.223
All the polls have been positive.

01:29:49.307 --> 01:29:53.353
Ah! But I didn't bring you here
to discuss politics and economics.

01:29:53.436 --> 01:29:56.439
I know how that must bore men like you.

01:29:57.065 --> 01:29:59.150
I just wanted your input, gentlemen.

01:29:59.233 --> 01:30:03.488
I know you're investigating events
that took place at the Nakamoto party.

01:30:04.614 --> 01:30:09.410
I wondered if you felt there was any linkage
between those unfortunate events...

01:30:09.494 --> 01:30:11.788
...and the proposed sale of MicroCon.

01:30:12.914 --> 01:30:14.999
We're not aware of any linkage.

01:30:16.167 --> 01:30:21.297
Has Nakamoto done anything unfair
or improper in promoting this sale?

01:30:21.381 --> 01:30:23.341
Not that we're aware of, no.

01:30:23.424 --> 01:30:25.426
Good.

01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:27.845
Your investigation is concluded, then?

01:30:29.097 --> 01:30:30.723
Yes.

01:30:31.474 --> 01:30:33.309
Good!

01:30:33.393 --> 01:30:35.895
That's it, then, gentlemen. Thank you.

01:30:37.397 --> 01:30:39.482
There's one for you.

01:30:39.565 --> 01:30:41.442
Thank you.

01:30:41.526 --> 01:30:45.238
And one for you. Thank you very much.

01:30:45.321 --> 01:30:49.409
- John, here's some more faxes.
- Ah, more support! Always welcome.

01:30:51.452 --> 01:30:53.162
Mind if I give you some advice?

01:30:55.164 --> 01:30:57.000
No.

01:30:57.083 --> 01:30:59.168
If a battle can't be won...

01:30:59.252 --> 01:31:01.254
...don't fight it.

01:31:05.258 --> 01:31:07.969
If a battle can't be won, don't fight it?

01:31:08.052 --> 01:31:12.056
Mm. The Art Of War. Sun Su, China.
Fifth century BC.

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:15.101
- An educated guy, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

01:31:15.184 --> 01:31:17.437
He read a fortune cookie once.

01:31:19.230 --> 01:31:21.524
Keep this number between us.

01:31:25.862 --> 01:31:28.781
Lieutenant Smith?
I have Lauren Smith for you.

01:31:28.865 --> 01:31:31.242
Ah, just what I needed.

01:31:31.326 --> 01:31:34.245
Webster, I'm calling to inform you
I'm taking Zelda.

01:31:34.329 --> 01:31:37.915
- When? This weekend?
- Today at 5 o'clock.

01:31:37.999 --> 01:31:39.876
What are you talking about?

01:31:39.959 --> 01:31:44.047
I'm talking about charges being brought
against you concerning bribery.

01:31:45.173 --> 01:31:48.343
Come on, Lauren.
You know everything about that charge.

01:31:48.426 --> 01:31:50.511
It was thrown out. Remember?

01:31:50.595 --> 01:31:53.848
- Come off it! We both know what happened.
- Stop it, Lauren.

01:31:53.932 --> 01:31:56.851
- Plus the fact that you’ve become a racist.
- A what?

01:31:56.935 --> 01:31:59.020
And you associate with known racists.

01:31:59.103 --> 01:32:03.733
The courts will find that you're providing
an improper atmosphere for our daughter.

01:32:03.816 --> 01:32:06.653
- They want you to back off.
- You're not taking Zelly.

01:32:06.736 --> 01:32:11.199
Are you denying me my right? I'm with
my attorney. We're recording this call.

01:32:11.282 --> 01:32:15.203
Record this. Fuck you! And fuck
your lawyer too, if you already haven't!

01:32:15.286 --> 01:32:17.330
You're not coming near Zelly...

01:32:17.413 --> 01:32:19.916
That's enough.

01:32:23.586 --> 01:32:27.340
What the fuck are you doing?
You wanna take me on? Step out of this car!

01:32:27.423 --> 01:32:30.551
I've had enough of you!
You wanna take me on?

01:32:32.887 --> 01:32:34.764
Get out! Come on!

01:32:34.847 --> 01:32:37.517
I'm tired of your shit!
I'm tired of her shit!

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.104
Come on! I'll pimp-slap you
up and down this fuckin' street!

01:32:41.187 --> 01:32:43.606
Tell me about the bribery charge, kohai.

01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:46.234
- The what?
- The bribery charge.

01:32:46.317 --> 01:32:50.655
Look. The woman who filed the charge
was a chronic psychiatric case.

01:32:50.738 --> 01:32:53.533
The review board dismissed it.
You got that?

01:32:53.616 --> 01:32:56.536
All right. Now I gotta go get Zelly.

01:32:56.619 --> 01:32:59.247
I can't help you if you won't tell me.

01:32:59.330 --> 01:33:01.916
Tell you what?! It was dismissed.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.419
You know cops are always being accused...

01:33:04.502 --> 01:33:08.089
...of assault, molestation, taking bribes.
All kinds of shit!

01:33:08.715 --> 01:33:10.800
Jesus Christ!

01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:14.637
I'm a good cop!

01:33:32.196 --> 01:33:34.449
It was a domestic violence call.

01:33:34.532 --> 01:33:37.160
The kid is in the crib
screaming his head off.

01:33:37.243 --> 01:33:41.205
I pull back the covers and next
to the kid is a kilo of white brick.

01:33:41.289 --> 01:33:43.416
Graham says we can't make the arrest...

01:33:43.499 --> 01:33:47.462
...that the search is invalid, the wife
can't testify against her husband...

01:33:47.545 --> 01:33:50.048
...and that any decent
lawyer will beat this.

01:33:50.131 --> 01:33:53.301
The woman is screaming,
the kid is screaming.

01:33:53.927 --> 01:33:56.012
I'm losing my mind here.

01:33:58.681 --> 01:34:03.811
Suddenly the husband walks in
with an envelope this thick...

01:34:03.895 --> 01:34:05.647
...with $100 bills.

01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:09.525
He says to me,
"Thank you, officer, for all your help. "

01:34:10.318 --> 01:34:12.403
"Thank you very much. "

01:34:12.487 --> 01:34:15.657
Graham turns to me and gives me the nod.

01:34:16.074 --> 01:34:17.951
And you took the money.

01:34:18.034 --> 01:34:20.203
What was I supposed to do, man?

01:34:20.286 --> 01:34:23.873
I mean, my wife...
My wife was pregnant.

01:34:23.957 --> 01:34:27.377
Health insurance didn't cover it.
We had bills up to here.

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.796
Yes! Yes! I took the money.

01:34:29.879 --> 01:34:31.965
Me and Graham split it.

01:34:34.467 --> 01:34:37.178
Now you're the only one that knows about it.

01:34:38.304 --> 01:34:40.390
Graham knows and now...

01:34:40.473 --> 01:34:41.891
...who else?

01:34:41.975 --> 01:34:44.310
Yeah. Graham knows.

01:34:44.894 --> 01:34:46.980
Wanna know why I told you?

01:34:47.063 --> 01:34:50.275
- Why?
- I figure you're on the take, too.

01:34:50.733 --> 01:34:54.946
- What are you talking about?
- That fuckin' fat envelope in your pocket.

01:34:55.029 --> 01:34:58.199
The one the guy gave you
back at the golf club.

01:34:58.283 --> 01:35:00.451
This is a golf membership.

01:35:00.535 --> 01:35:03.705
Oh! So how much
is a membership worth these days?

01:35:05.623 --> 01:35:07.208
A hundred thousand.

01:35:07.667 --> 01:35:09.752
A hundred thousand.

01:35:09.836 --> 01:35:13.548
Boy, they sure make it easy
to take 100,000 bucks, don't they?

01:35:15.216 --> 01:35:17.302
Golf is how they do business.

01:35:17.385 --> 01:35:19.762
This is very important for what I do.

01:35:19.846 --> 01:35:24.142
Well, I guess that makes everything
all white now, doesn't it?

01:35:41.951 --> 01:35:44.287
Make sure she hasn't taken Zelly.

01:35:44.370 --> 01:35:46.914
Damn! If it's not one thing, it's another.

01:35:46.998 --> 01:35:49.083
Zelly!

01:35:49.417 --> 01:35:52.170
Zelly! Hey, babe, you here?

01:35:55.882 --> 01:35:57.967
Somebody's here.

01:35:58.051 --> 01:36:00.386
I was wondering where he would show up.

01:36:01.846 --> 01:36:03.306
Oh, my God!

01:36:07.101 --> 01:36:08.770
Put that phone down!

01:36:08.853 --> 01:36:12.440
- I'm just calling my guys.
- Put the phone down.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.989
- So who was killed in the car crash?
- Tanaka.

01:36:20.073 --> 01:36:21.991
- The security guy.
- Yes...

01:36:22.075 --> 01:36:23.743
...Tanaka.

01:36:23.826 --> 01:36:27.622
He worked for Nakamoto,
but he had a special relationship with me.

01:36:27.705 --> 01:36:31.584
My father's keiretsu could offer
a better future to him, understand?

01:36:31.668 --> 01:36:34.671
Tanaka... He liked women.

01:36:34.754 --> 01:36:39.425
And drugs too. And for that,
give me good information.

01:36:39.509 --> 01:36:44.138
- He tried to set you up as the murderer.
- Well, he was playing both sides.

01:36:44.222 --> 01:36:46.474
Look, I'm still alive. He's still dead.

01:36:46.557 --> 01:36:49.769
He double-crossed me,
but I double-crossed him better.

01:36:49.852 --> 01:36:53.815
He's afraid to get caught with me
so he uses my car... and kill himself.

01:36:55.441 --> 01:36:57.944
Ah, I didn't like the color anyway.

01:37:00.029 --> 01:37:02.198
You reported the murder.

01:37:02.907 --> 01:37:05.076
Then you called me in, hm?

01:37:05.159 --> 01:37:09.455
My father always said,
if you need help, call Connor-san.

01:37:09.539 --> 01:37:13.376
Those Japanese guys,
what were they looking for in the car?

01:37:13.459 --> 01:37:17.338
What Tanaka brought Eddie...
and what Eddie was going to give to us.

01:37:18.381 --> 01:37:20.466
That's right, Connor-san.

01:37:22.093 --> 01:37:24.637
- The original disk.
- Connor-san...

01:37:24.721 --> 01:37:26.806
...you smart cookie for a gaijin.

01:37:26.889 --> 01:37:29.475
But you're gonna be surprised
when you see this.

01:37:30.018 --> 01:37:34.355
Uh-uh. First, give me back my passport.

01:37:34.439 --> 01:37:36.566
I think I'm gonna need it.

01:37:41.738 --> 01:37:43.823
Careful, kohai.

01:37:43.906 --> 01:37:46.534
- Who is it?
- Me, Web. Let me in.

01:37:46.618 --> 01:37:48.703
It's Graham.

01:37:48.786 --> 01:37:50.872
Hide a sword with a smile.

01:37:54.459 --> 01:37:57.921
Hey, Tom! How you doing?
What are you doing here? What's wrong?

01:37:58.004 --> 01:38:00.423
- Wrong?
- Yeah.

01:38:03.051 --> 01:38:05.136
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:38:05.219 --> 01:38:07.305
What are you talking about?

01:38:10.099 --> 01:38:12.769
The squeeze is on, baby.

01:38:12.852 --> 01:38:14.812
Your ex is talking.

01:38:14.896 --> 01:38:17.857
The chief is shitting
and the Weasel's snooping.

01:38:17.941 --> 01:38:20.985
- Opening up new things.
- New things?

01:38:21.069 --> 01:38:23.154
What new things?

01:38:23.237 --> 01:38:25.323
Look, are you on the take?

01:38:25.406 --> 01:38:28.701
- Fuck you, the take.
- Are you on the fuckin' take?!

01:38:28.785 --> 01:38:32.121
Who the fuck are you to ask me about that?

01:38:32.205 --> 01:38:34.916
You started me off. You remember that?

01:38:35.625 --> 01:38:37.710
Now, play ball.

01:38:37.794 --> 01:38:41.589
You get to keep your kid, your job,
and your buddies. We're a team, Web.

01:38:41.673 --> 01:38:44.509
A team? What team are we on, huh?

01:38:46.719 --> 01:38:48.805
We know who you've got in there.

01:38:48.888 --> 01:38:51.182
You're harboring a murderer in there.

01:38:51.266 --> 01:38:53.768
How did you know Eddie was still alive?

01:38:53.851 --> 01:38:57.313
He's not! He's dead.

01:38:57.397 --> 01:38:59.524
He just forgot to lay down.

01:38:59.607 --> 01:39:01.401
- He didn't do it.
- Who did it?

01:39:01.484 --> 01:39:03.569
We don't know who did it!

01:39:04.487 --> 01:39:07.615
Send him out, Spider-san,
with the disk, too.

01:39:09.158 --> 01:39:11.244
I'll protect the guy.

01:39:11.327 --> 01:39:13.413
And what if I don't?

01:39:13.496 --> 01:39:15.498
If you don't?!

01:39:15.581 --> 01:39:18.543
If you don't, you're obstructing justice.

01:39:18.626 --> 01:39:20.712
You're harboring, baby.

01:39:20.795 --> 01:39:23.798
If you don't, we're coming in
after a murderer.

01:39:27.093 --> 01:39:29.178
What are you doing to your life?

01:39:31.639 --> 01:39:34.142
You know me, Web. I get my man.

01:39:34.225 --> 01:39:37.562
Yeah. Even if he's the wrong man.

01:39:37.979 --> 01:39:41.566
Who the fuck are you? The Supreme Court?

01:39:42.233 --> 01:39:47.322
You're putting a lot of guys
in the line of fire to protect one dead Nip.

01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:58.374
You risk your life and your child for me.

01:40:00.376 --> 01:40:02.754
Kariga dekimashita.

01:40:15.934 --> 01:40:18.019
We're like sitting ducks up here.

01:40:20.396 --> 01:40:22.482
Time to be among them.

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.326
Don't let anyone in.

01:40:34.827 --> 01:40:36.913
Put this on.

01:40:37.789 --> 01:40:39.874
And don't try to go out.

01:40:45.338 --> 01:40:47.215
Arigato.

01:40:58.142 --> 01:40:59.978
Daddy!

01:41:00.061 --> 01:41:01.229
Zelly.

01:41:02.647 --> 01:41:05.066
Baby, not right now, OK?

01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:07.860
You and Grandma want to stay in the room.
Go!

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:18.830
Don't do anything.
We'll take care of everything.

01:41:39.225 --> 01:41:41.227
They want us to wait.

01:41:41.311 --> 01:41:45.356
This Eddie guy's alive.
They want a shot at him.

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:50.945
I gotta figure this.

01:41:52.822 --> 01:41:55.325
The first rule is to protect your ass.

01:41:55.408 --> 01:41:58.953
Maybe we ought to get some backup.
What do you say?

01:42:19.682 --> 01:42:21.184
Hello.

01:42:33.279 --> 01:42:34.906
Hai.

01:43:13.319 --> 01:43:15.488
Kohai, it's me.

01:43:18.866 --> 01:43:21.995
Come on, let's go.
I've cleared the back staircase. Go!

01:43:22.078 --> 01:43:23.788
Come, come, come.

01:43:23.871 --> 01:43:25.957
I'll stay with Eddie.

01:43:28.543 --> 01:43:30.420
Daddy!

01:43:30.503 --> 01:43:32.171
Zelly.

01:43:55.903 --> 01:43:57.488
Eddie!

01:44:13.963 --> 01:44:15.506
Eddie!

01:44:30.271 --> 01:44:32.382
Eddie!

01:44:32.665 --> 01:44:33.609
Eddie!

01:44:39.322 --> 01:44:41.282
Eddie!

01:44:46.287 --> 01:44:47.497
Hey!

01:45:00.009 --> 01:45:02.053
Web!

01:45:02.553 --> 01:45:04.222
Web.

01:45:05.682 --> 01:45:07.767
Kohai.

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:13.940
And that's all I remember.

01:45:15.775 --> 01:45:18.695
Luckily, you were wearing the proper gear.

01:45:18.778 --> 01:45:20.989
Yeah. Luckily.

01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:26.619
You've read this morning's paper.

01:45:26.703 --> 01:45:29.580
You were caught
in the middle of gang warfare.

01:45:29.664 --> 01:45:34.127
Man, I was caught
in the middle of a business negotiation.

01:45:34.210 --> 01:45:36.254
No, Lieutenant.

01:45:36.337 --> 01:45:38.339
You can read.

01:45:38.423 --> 01:45:43.011
You were the target
of a drive-by shooting by a street gang.

01:45:43.094 --> 01:45:45.179
It was a grudge attack.

01:45:45.263 --> 01:45:47.974
None of the suspects has been apprehended.

01:45:48.057 --> 01:45:52.228
One gang member was found murdered
by ritual strangulation.

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:54.731
So Eddie's dead now.

01:45:54.814 --> 01:45:56.816
Officially.

01:45:56.899 --> 01:46:00.361
Officially, the case is closed.

01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:03.323
Under the circumstances...

01:46:03.406 --> 01:46:08.286
...we're recommending that you take
a voluntary leave of absence.

01:46:10.663 --> 01:46:12.707
And, Lieutenant...

01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:16.961
...would you be able to tell us
the whereabouts of Captain Connor?

01:46:20.214 --> 01:46:22.133
No.

01:46:22.216 --> 01:46:24.385
I have no idea where he is.

01:46:28.473 --> 01:46:30.558
They shut us down.

01:46:30.642 --> 01:46:33.770
Put a padlock on the front door,
just like that.

01:46:33.853 --> 01:46:35.688
Know how it works?

01:46:35.772 --> 01:46:39.984
A phone call to the university president
from major endowers.

01:46:40.902 --> 01:46:43.404
The fuckers can't stop us that easily.

01:46:45.448 --> 01:46:48.743
- They're still ahead of us, kohai.
- Got here as fast as I could.

01:46:48.826 --> 01:46:50.453
They're looking for you.

01:46:50.536 --> 01:46:53.122
We've been piecing it together.

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:56.334
Earlier in the evening,
Eddie and Cheryl made love.

01:46:56.417 --> 01:47:00.088
But at the party she met another man,
her secret lover.

01:47:00.171 --> 01:47:02.090
Her back-door man.

01:47:02.173 --> 01:47:05.426
Someone at Nakamoto
must have suggested...

01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:09.389
...that they use the executive bedroom
on the 46th floor.

01:47:09.472 --> 01:47:12.976
But they never got
beyond the boardroom table.

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:15.603
Here comes your ghost.

01:47:21.943 --> 01:47:24.612
Eddie. Before they erased him.

01:47:25.738 --> 01:47:28.950
- He's letting her get killed.
- He's seen this before.

01:47:29.033 --> 01:47:31.327
The gasper routine.

01:47:32.912 --> 01:47:35.498
Funny old world, eh?

01:47:35.582 --> 01:47:37.959
I thought Eddie was the jealous lover.

01:47:38.042 --> 01:47:40.628
A stronger passion overtook him.

01:47:40.712 --> 01:47:43.006
His loyalty to his father's keiretsu.

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:45.758
They also wanted to purchase MicroCon.

01:47:45.842 --> 01:47:49.387
Don't forget there's a keiretsuwar going on.

01:47:51.514 --> 01:47:53.600
Who is it?

01:47:54.225 --> 01:47:56.311
Who is it?

01:47:56.853 --> 01:47:58.396
Senator Morton.

01:47:58.479 --> 01:48:02.859
Eddie probably offered her
to the Senator as form of hospitality.

01:48:02.942 --> 01:48:05.111
So, Senator Morton killed her?

01:48:05.194 --> 01:48:07.363
Wait till you see the rest of the disk.

01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:10.950
We know they used this situation
to blackmail Senator Morton.

01:48:11.034 --> 01:48:13.995
They pinned the murder on Eddie
by doctoring the disk.

01:48:14.078 --> 01:48:18.333
- Why was Eddie protecting him?
- The Senator was voting in his favor.

01:48:18.416 --> 01:48:21.210
This is about who would control MicroCon.

01:48:21.294 --> 01:48:25.506
Whoever controlled the Senator
would control the fate of MicroCon.

01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:28.593
This is the part of the disk
we never saw before.

01:48:28.676 --> 01:48:30.762
There. You see that?

01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.097
Yeah, the clock. It's moving.

01:48:33.181 --> 01:48:35.558
No. The girl.

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:37.727
She's moving.

01:48:38.519 --> 01:48:40.605
Holy shit.

01:48:40.688 --> 01:48:42.190
She's alive.

01:48:42.273 --> 01:48:45.401
She was alive, until...

01:48:48.029 --> 01:48:50.114
Now, who the hell is this?

01:48:50.198 --> 01:48:52.951
Someone who's been observing...

01:48:53.034 --> 01:48:57.664
...and knows the exact location
of the hidden cameras.

01:49:47.922 --> 01:49:49.716
Please go on.

01:49:49.799 --> 01:49:52.176
What? That's it?

01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.512
That's all we got?!

01:49:54.596 --> 01:49:58.558
- We can't let 'em get away with this shit.
- Get away with this?

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.686
They won't get away with this.

01:50:02.103 --> 01:50:05.023
I am very, very okotta!

01:50:05.106 --> 01:50:07.900
- Pissed off.
- Yes! Pissed off.

01:50:08.568 --> 01:50:11.487
Good. So what do we do now?

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:14.115
Yes. What do we do now?

01:50:14.198 --> 01:50:17.452
- You're asking me?
- Yes.

01:50:17.535 --> 01:50:20.997
We beat the grass to startle the snakes.

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.166
Exactly.

01:50:34.385 --> 01:50:36.471
Oh, my God.

01:51:19.222 --> 01:51:20.974
Hai. Moshi-moshi.

01:51:21.057 --> 01:51:23.101
We had an agreement.

01:51:23.184 --> 01:51:25.395
You said nothing would happen.

01:51:25.478 --> 01:51:27.981
- We had a deal!
- Yes, sir.

01:51:28.064 --> 01:51:30.149
Did you see what I just got by fax?!

01:51:30.233 --> 01:51:33.820
I understand. Thank you.
Very kind of you to call.

01:51:33.903 --> 01:51:35.989
...the fucking technology would protect me!

01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:52.505
Oh, my God. Look at this.

01:51:52.589 --> 01:51:56.426
We will decide
whether the MicroCon sale goes through.

01:51:56.509 --> 01:52:00.680
I will be basing my vote
on my country's needs.

01:52:01.973 --> 01:52:06.436
You have aspirations
perhaps for the highest office in the land.

01:52:44.933 --> 01:52:46.684
Excuse me just a second.

01:52:46.768 --> 01:52:49.270
Hey uh... Can I help you with something?

01:52:49.354 --> 01:52:52.300
Hey! What's going on?
You can't barge in...

01:52:52.301 --> 01:52:53.201
You, shut up.

01:52:53.382 --> 01:52:55.026
Yoshida-san.

01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:56.986
Forgive this interruption.

01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:59.322
But there is something I must show you.

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:04.369
This is the original disk from your security
cameras that filmed this conference room.

01:53:04.452 --> 01:53:07.830
And recorded the murder... and the murderer.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:13.670
We are grateful to you, Yoshida-san, for
insisting that Ishihara deliver this to us.

01:53:14.545 --> 01:53:19.759
But instead... he replaced it
with this doctored version.

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:32.188
Please. Show us the original disk.

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.773
Arigato.

01:54:09.934 --> 01:54:11.811
I will deal with this.

01:54:11.894 --> 01:54:14.689
- Get out!
- Dete itte kudasai!

01:54:14.772 --> 01:54:16.774
Otoko ni mukatte nanda!

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.799
They are distancing themselves.

01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:51.935
- Holy shit.
- Senator Morton.

01:54:55.271 --> 01:54:57.148
At this moment...

01:54:57.231 --> 01:54:58.983
...she's not dead.

01:54:59.067 --> 01:55:02.779
And now we shall find out
who actually killed her.

01:55:08.618 --> 01:55:12.080
Why was I not told this?!

01:55:12.163 --> 01:55:14.624
What has been happening here?

01:55:31.766 --> 01:55:36.271
I was protecting the situation, Yoshida-san.

01:55:40.692 --> 01:55:43.236
He has been too long in America.

01:55:43.319 --> 01:55:46.030
He has adopted many bad habits.

01:56:11.222 --> 01:56:13.308
No!

01:56:13.391 --> 01:56:16.144
It was not me.

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:19.856
It was him!

01:56:43.421 --> 01:56:46.132
Hey, there's no running... Hey! Slow down!

01:56:52.013 --> 01:56:54.140
Hey, there's no running here!

01:57:43.648 --> 01:57:46.651
Keep eye contact at all times.

01:57:46.734 --> 01:57:50.280
And at all costs, don't lose your temper.

01:57:50.863 --> 01:57:52.949
I don't lose my temper.

01:57:58.288 --> 01:58:00.873
How are you doing, guys?
How are you doing?

01:58:00.957 --> 01:58:04.752
Konbanwa. Watashi wa...

01:58:04.836 --> 01:58:06.754
We're cops, man.

01:58:06.838 --> 01:58:09.966
Step aside, we'll have no trouble.
This is police business.

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:12.427
It seems like nobody's listening.

01:58:18.266 --> 01:58:20.351
Come on, come on!

01:58:45.376 --> 01:58:47.462
It's me.

01:58:49.964 --> 01:58:51.716
I could have taken 'em.

01:58:51.799 --> 01:58:54.594
Their objective was not to win,
but to delay us.

01:58:54.677 --> 01:58:56.429
And they've succeeded.

01:59:07.398 --> 01:59:09.567
Eddie's friends.

01:59:10.234 --> 01:59:12.987
Looks like they've got their revenge.

01:59:16.991 --> 01:59:18.243
Shit.

01:59:21.204 --> 01:59:23.706
We gotta stop this!
We gotta do something!

01:59:26.251 --> 01:59:28.336
Do what?

01:59:30.546 --> 01:59:32.632
He's finished.

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:37.720
That cement dries fast.

01:59:37.804 --> 01:59:41.557
And there's no way
they're gonna rip open that foundation.

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:44.227
Everyone wants this case closed.

01:59:50.775 --> 01:59:52.193
Besides...

01:59:52.277 --> 01:59:54.862
...they put us on leave of absence.

02:00:04.956 --> 02:00:07.250
So, what will MicroCon do now?

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:09.836
- Struggle on.
- We'll find a way.

02:00:09.919 --> 02:00:13.923
Or a way will find you.
I hope we can continue our friendship.

02:00:14.007 --> 02:00:17.719
- Uh, sure. Let's do lunch sometime.
- Let's do lunch.

02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:23.516
What's going to happen to him?

02:00:23.766 --> 02:00:25.935
They are retiring him.

02:00:26.019 --> 02:00:28.062
Ishihara will be given a window seat.

02:00:28.146 --> 02:00:32.191
He will spend the rest of his life in Japan,
staring out an office window.

02:00:32.275 --> 02:00:34.485
Too bad. He seemed like a heck of a guy.

02:00:34.569 --> 02:00:36.988
Personally, I got along great with him.

02:00:43.745 --> 02:00:46.205
If you sit by the river long enough...

02:00:46.289 --> 02:00:49.751
...you will see the body
of your enemy floating by.

02:00:50.919 --> 02:00:52.795
Connor-san.

02:00:52.879 --> 02:00:56.341
I wanna thank you.
I feel I should repay you with something.

02:00:56.424 --> 02:00:58.760
Repay me? For what?

02:00:58.843 --> 02:01:01.471
- Well...
- The key.

02:01:01.638 --> 02:01:03.348
Ah, yes. The key.

02:01:03.431 --> 02:01:06.976
The key is... don't talk about it.
Just do it.

02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:09.020
The kohai talks.

02:01:09.103 --> 02:01:11.189
The sempai knows.

02:01:11.272 --> 02:01:13.358
- If I wanna be a sempai...
- No.

02:01:13.441 --> 02:01:15.234
The key.

02:01:15.652 --> 02:01:18.863
- What?
- The key to your car.

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:21.616
Oh! Yeah.

02:01:21.699 --> 02:01:23.785
I knew that.

02:01:23.868 --> 02:01:26.329
Today at golf, we'll be discussing...

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:29.916
...how I can help Nakamoto
pull out of the MicroCon deal...

02:01:29.999 --> 02:01:32.252
...without losing face.

02:01:32.335 --> 02:01:35.505
- Keiretsu interruptus.
- Exactly.

02:01:42.095 --> 02:01:44.597
Very nice working with you, kohai.

02:01:44.681 --> 02:01:45.723
See you.

02:01:46.099 --> 02:01:47.934
See you.

02:01:48.393 --> 02:01:50.728
Yoshida-san.

02:01:51.688 --> 02:01:54.065
A perfect day for golf.

02:02:06.327 --> 02:02:10.707
Well, thanks to your help,
we were able to find out who did it.

02:02:11.374 --> 02:02:13.459
- Did you?
- Did we what?

02:02:13.543 --> 02:02:15.420
Find out?

02:02:16.754 --> 02:02:18.673
Find out? You mean who did it?

02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:21.426
Come on!

02:02:21.509 --> 02:02:24.929
You know in Japan,
the one who confesses to the murder...

02:02:25.013 --> 02:02:27.265
...doesn't have to be the one that did it.

02:02:27.348 --> 02:02:29.809
It's an old tradition that,
out of loyalty...

02:02:29.892 --> 02:02:32.061
...an innocent man
will take the rap for his boss.

02:02:33.021 --> 02:02:34.814
It's his duty.

02:02:34.897 --> 02:02:37.191
That's not what happened here.

02:02:37.275 --> 02:02:41.779
That Richmond guy would have done
anything to make that deal go through.

02:02:41.863 --> 02:02:44.157
He was working with Ishihara.

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:47.785
A yuppie facilitator,
a hustling business samurai.

02:02:48.328 --> 02:02:50.538
Wave of the future.

02:02:50.622 --> 02:02:52.624
If you say so.

02:02:52.707 --> 02:02:54.250
If I say so?

02:02:54.334 --> 02:02:58.963
Look, I'm a cop.
It's my business to know these things.

02:02:59.047 --> 02:03:01.841
Besides... what about Connor?

02:03:02.634 --> 02:03:06.012
- What about him?
- The guy's always right.

02:03:07.263 --> 02:03:09.349
If you say so.

02:03:12.727 --> 02:03:14.812
Did I say something to anger you?

02:03:14.896 --> 02:03:18.274
- No, nothing you said.
- Then, what is it?

02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:23.529
- Golf.
- Golf?

02:03:23.988 --> 02:03:25.782
I don't get it.

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:27.825
There it is up there.

02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:34.374
You live here.

02:03:34.457 --> 02:03:36.542
428 Rose Street.

02:03:37.377 --> 02:03:39.462
Well, well, well.

02:03:41.839 --> 02:03:45.260
When I came to pick him up
that first time...

02:03:45.343 --> 02:03:48.096
...behind the sliding panel...

02:03:48.179 --> 02:03:50.265
...that was you?

02:03:51.683 --> 02:03:55.436
The gaijin that you lived with in Japan...

02:03:55.937 --> 02:03:58.398
...that was Connor.

02:03:58.481 --> 02:04:00.525
Thanks for giving me a lift.

02:04:00.608 --> 02:04:02.360
Wait a minute.

02:04:02.443 --> 02:04:05.238
There's some things here I don't understand.

02:04:05.321 --> 02:04:06.823
Yes.

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.992
Goodbye, kohai.

02:04:09.367 --> 02:04:11.035
No, no!

02:04:11.828 --> 02:04:16.082
Now, look.
I mean, the guy, he's playing golf now.

02:04:16.291 --> 02:04:18.376
You and me, we're alone.

02:04:20.003 --> 02:04:21.671
And...

02:04:24.757 --> 02:04:27.260
I know.

02:04:27.343 --> 02:04:31.222
They say loyalty is important.
It all comes down to who you trust.

02:04:34.267 --> 02:04:36.269
Wait a minute.

02:04:36.352 --> 02:04:38.646
When he said that line about uh...

02:04:38.730 --> 02:04:42.984
..."Always leave the cage door open
so the bird can return"...

02:04:43.067 --> 02:04:46.404
...what the hell does that mean anyway?

02:04:47.322 --> 02:04:49.407
Who knows?

02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:52.201
When you figure it out, Web...

02:04:52.285 --> 02:04:54.370
...let me know.

02:04:57.749 --> 02:04:59.417
Damn!

02:05:21.564 --> 02:05:23.441
Hm.

02:05:39.624 --> 02:05:41.709
Kohai!
