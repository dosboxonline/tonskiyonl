00:01.127 --> 00:02.127
<i>Previously on "The Rookie."</i>

00:02.128 --> 00:04.254
- Hey!
- So I sent a reckless text.

00:04.255 --> 00:06.715
Reckless text?
That's criminal conspiracy!

00:06.716 --> 00:09.426
The fact that you are mad
at <i>me</i> kind of blows my mind.

00:09.427 --> 00:10.760
The fact that
you are judging me

00:10.761 --> 00:13.179
instead of empathizing
is blowing mine.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.597
- You're moving?
- Kind of.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.307
The Hammer
is called the Hammer

00:16.308 --> 00:18.143
because he likes to fight

00:18.144 --> 00:20.645
and there's no one he loves
to fight more than cops.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.732
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.317
We shouldn't.
- I know.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.487
Good morning.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.406
Thanks, everyone,
for being here.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.075
The hardest step is showing up,
and we got that one down.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.452
Yeah.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.078
Who wants to start?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.709
Tim?

00:42.710 --> 00:45.295
What's on your mind?

00:45.296 --> 00:49.674
I messed up with Lucy, I think.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.801
Well, Valentine's Day
is tough.

00:51.802 --> 00:55.221
Look, things have been
solid between us recently.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.265
You know, I--I--I really--

00:57.266 --> 01:00.518
I really feel like I'd earned
my way back in.

01:00.519 --> 01:04.689
You know? Both on a personal
and professional level.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.567
And then...

01:07.568 --> 01:09.486
we ended up in this hotel room,
and I--

01:09.487 --> 01:12.614
I knew it was a bad idea
in the moment,

01:12.615 --> 01:14.824
that I was being selfish.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.118
You know, that--

01:17.119 --> 01:19.329
That I hadn't finished
doing the work

01:19.330 --> 01:21.499
to fix what I had broke.

01:24.168 --> 01:27.253
I just--I couldn't help myself.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.506
This is said with love...

01:29.507 --> 01:32.467
but you're using a lot
of "I" language.

01:32.468 --> 01:34.636
I felt this, I did that.

01:34.637 --> 01:37.096
But Lucy was
a willing participant, yes?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.723
Yeah, of course.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.351
Then why are you
taking away her agency?

01:41.352 --> 01:44.270
If this was a mistake,

01:44.271 --> 01:47.524
then it's one
you made together.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.576
Last day as a rookie!

01:58.577 --> 02:01.287
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
It's just--it's very exciting.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.207
Yeah, no, it--it is awesome.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.668
Oh, I--
I sense a but in there.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.169
You know,
a high percentage of rookies

02:08.170 --> 02:09.796
suffer a setback
on their last day,

02:09.797 --> 02:12.757
so you just gotta stay on top
of it and don't get distracted.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.801
Well, that's certainly
taking the fun out of it.

02:14.802 --> 02:19.222
No, no. I'm sorry.
It--it is amazing.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.849
New lipstick.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.226
You're a little bit more, uh,
made up than usual.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.686
What's happening?

02:24.687 --> 02:26.563
Nothing.
I'm just switching it up a bit.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.481
Stop!
- What? Come on.

02:28.482 --> 02:32.235
Maybe I should too.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.820
No.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.321
Stay the course.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.698
Tomorrow I can go crazy.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.325
Tomorrow,
when I'm no longer a rookie.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.870
<i>♪ Oh, I'm gonna win
for you ♪</i>

02:41.871 --> 02:44.831
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

02:47.334 --> 02:48.585
Hang in there, man.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.670
Okay.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.839
We got your back, big dog.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.258
Thanks.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.593
What's happening?

02:56.594 --> 02:57.677
Everybody's heard
you and Bailey are fighting.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.888
Cops gossip more
than middle schoolers.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.265
First marriage
is just a trial run.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.226
There's no shame in divorce.
Every cop goes through this.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.895
Okay, it's not
my first marriage.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.439
And we're not getting divorced.
It--it's just a fight.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.482
Uh-huh.

03:11.483 --> 03:15.570
I used this guy for
my last three divorces.

03:15.571 --> 03:16.905
How many times have
you been married?

03:16.906 --> 03:19.741
This decade? Just three.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.701
You keep that. I don't think
I'll be needing it.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.411
Denial. I get it.

03:25.915 --> 03:29.709
Stay strong.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.836
This is ridiculous.
Couples fight.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.922
I mean, granted,
it's a bad one.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.298
But it's not over.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.674
Great.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.926
I feel like
you don't believe me.

03:37.927 --> 03:39.802
Feel like
you don't believe yourself.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.305
Yeah, I don't know.
It's just--

03:42.306 --> 03:43.473
God, it's taking up
so much space in my brain.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.308
I just gotta get of my head.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.309
You know what helps me?

03:46.310 --> 03:47.810
- Violence?
- Action.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.938
Pull some felony warrants,
get in trouble.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.898
Last thing you'll be thinking
about is a personal woe.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.816
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.568
Yeah.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.236
I mean, you and Camilla were
on completely different paths.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.697
It's clearly for the best.
- I know.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.951
But my problems right now are
minor in comparison to yours.

04:02.952 --> 04:04.369
How's the cancer treatment
going, my brother?

04:04.370 --> 04:05.870
So far, so good.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.372
You sure you're ready
to be here, Boot?

04:07.373 --> 04:09.248
Uh, yes, sir.
Thanks for asking.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.583
I'm not asking to be kind.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.793
I'm asking because
if you're not up to the task,

04:11.794 --> 04:13.711
you put the life of your TO
in jeopardy.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.922
Uh, no, sir.
I--I--uh, yes, sir.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.591
I mean I am good to go
and I will not let her down.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.510
Make sure you don't, or
we're going to have problems.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.475
You're here early.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.352
Sometimes being
Detective Harper

04:29.353 --> 04:30.937
is easier than being Mama.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.355
Or Mrs.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.607
Yes, that one is
really tough right now.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.860
The constant arguing over
policing is wearing me out.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.862
Harper, you're needed
in Interrogation One.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.030
- For what?
- No idea.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.574
That's just the message
I was given.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.702
Okay.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.373
What--uh--

04:50.374 --> 04:51.791
why?

04:51.792 --> 04:52.875
We were supposed to talk
this morning,

04:52.876 --> 04:54.794
and you left before I woke up.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.295
I'm sorry.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.423
I just--I have a really
heavy caseload right now.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.800
Nyla, you always do.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.385
But you're the one

05:02.386 --> 05:04.303
who raised the red flag
about our relationship

05:04.304 --> 05:06.472
and how our jobs
make our marriage

05:06.473 --> 05:08.725
that much more difficult
sometimes, and yet,

05:08.726 --> 05:11.352
you've been avoiding
talking about it.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.813
So yeah, I've had to resort
to gimmicks like this

05:13.814 --> 05:17.817
just to get some face time
with my wife.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.738
Okay. Uh, you are not wrong.

05:21.739 --> 05:25.533
What if there is no way to make
you feel good about what I do?

05:25.534 --> 05:29.037
Then we deal with it.

05:29.038 --> 05:31.372
I mean, maybe
that tears us apart,

05:31.373 --> 05:34.333
or maybe we get stronger
by solving it together.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.586
But either way,
it's a hell of a lot better

05:36.587 --> 05:38.421
than this slow dance
of silence.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.677
Now, I got to go to a meeting.
Um, I'll see you tonight.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.895
How are you feeling?

05:53.896 --> 05:56.564
Pretty good,
all things considered.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.733
Yeah, well, it seems like
there's a lot of options

05:58.734 --> 06:00.485
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

06:00.486 --> 06:03.362
Have you had any lymphedema?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.947
Not a lot of people know
about that side effect.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.824
Something's going on
with my rookie.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.117
It's on me to do the homework.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.536
Yeah, or try
to catch me in a lie.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.996
Never occurred to me that

06:11.997 --> 06:14.373
you would lie about
something like that.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.958
Look, I--

06:15.959 --> 06:17.126
I know I don't have
the best track record,

06:17.127 --> 06:19.755
but I would never
lie about cancer.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.091
If you have any doubts,

06:23.092 --> 06:24.842
you know you can always
check my medical records.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.511
I'm a rookie.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.721
I signed away my
medical privacy when I joined.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.807
I might do that.

06:30.808 --> 06:31.808
Yeah.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.893
Yeah, you should.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.144
You know, I'm--
I'm open to anything

06:35.145 --> 06:37.688
that'll help
rebuild the trust between us.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.735
Hey, stranger. What's up?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.487
I need to show you something.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.696
Can you meet me
at the apartment?

06:45.697 --> 06:47.406
Yeah.
I don't like the sound of that.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.909
Uh, I'll be there
in ten minutes.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.744
But it's my last day
as a rookie.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.954
I understand.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.998
Well, I was hoping
to avoid situations

06:55.999 --> 06:58.000
that would jeopardize
my graduation

06:58.001 --> 06:59.669
from the FTO program.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.505
And yet as your training
officer for this one last day,

07:02.506 --> 07:03.840
I set the agenda.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.467
And I say the agenda
is go hard.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.761
Is this so you won't have
to think about Bailey?

07:08.762 --> 07:09.762
If it is, do you really think

07:09.763 --> 07:11.639
it's a good idea
to say her name?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.099
No, sir.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.768
I am fully on board
with going hard.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.770
Whatever my TO wants.
- Great.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.564
Check the box,
see who's got warrants.

07:19.565 --> 07:22.775
Make sure they're felony NBA
so they're in a fighting mood.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.446
The ball's in his court.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.949
John knows where to find me
when he wants to talk.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.702
And if he doesn't?

07:32.703 --> 07:34.162
He will.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.497
Obviously, I don't really
know what's going on

07:36.498 --> 07:40.126
because you've been maddeningly
vague, but it's been a week.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.587
Might be time to reach out.

07:42.588 --> 07:43.713
You want me off your couch?

07:43.714 --> 07:44.964
No.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.507
A little.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.468
A timeline would be nice.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.013
<i>10-99 at
1600 Beechwood Street.</i>

07:52.014 --> 07:53.723
<i>10-99 at 1600--</i>

07:53.724 --> 07:55.641
- What's that?
- VARDA alarm.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.810
Bypasses dispatch to alert
all nearby units.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.645
Shelters and clinics have them
to speed up the response time

07:59.646 --> 08:01.772
for break-ins and assaults.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.191
It's the
Good Samaritan Women's Shelter.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.651
Control, 7-Adam-100
responding to that 10-99,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.737
1600 Beechwood Street.
Code-3.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.198
<i>Copy. Follow-up call
reports disgruntled husband</i>

08:10.199 --> 08:12.158
<i>attempting to enter,
armed with bat.</i>

08:12.159 --> 08:15.161
Punch it! Let's get there.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.705
Manya! Out of my way!
I want to talk to my wife!

08:17.706 --> 08:18.748
With a bat?

08:18.749 --> 08:20.750
Restraining order
says 100 yards.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.961
I warned you!

08:23.962 --> 08:25.963
Drop the bat!

08:32.804 --> 08:35.139
- Damn it!
- Give up! Drop the bat!

08:41.230 --> 08:44.106
I got him!

08:44.107 --> 08:48.110
Get off me!

08:48.111 --> 08:49.570
I saw your head
hit the concrete.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.613
How's your vision?

08:50.614 --> 08:52.114
Uh, fine.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.534
Uh, Cody went down harder
than I did thanks to you.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.536
I'd still like to get you
evaluated for a concussion.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.121
And let's splint this wrist.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.832
The bruising and swelling
indicates a fracture.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.167
Yeah.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.878
Why is it taking so long
to find a hot warrant?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.004
Yeah, turns out we've got

09:07.005 --> 09:09.298
most of the real bad guys
in custody.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.801
Yay us!

09:12.761 --> 09:14.178
Checking again.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.722
<i>7-Adam-15,

09:22.729 --> 09:24.230
What are the odds
that's our van?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.690
Fairly small, given there are

09:25.691 --> 09:27.566
several thousand blue vans
in Los Angeles.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.943
We're still going to stop
and investigate

09:28.944 --> 09:31.028
and hope it's full
of armed robbers?

09:31.029 --> 09:32.613
Now you're getting
the swing of today.

09:38.161 --> 09:42.081
7-Adam-15, we are Code-6,
Lancaster and Western,

09:42.082 --> 09:44.125
investigating possible
suspect vehicle.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.126
Driver!

09:45.127 --> 09:46.294
Please exit the vehicle,

09:46.295 --> 09:47.838
keeping your hands where
I can see them!

09:50.340 --> 09:51.758
Yep!

09:56.638 --> 09:58.097
No problem...

09:58.098 --> 09:59.098
officers.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.099
Oh.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.767
Steady, Officer Juarez.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.312
Need you to go clear the front.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.730
Step forward for me, sir.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.273
Uh, what can
I help you with today?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.608
It's not illegal
to run out of petrol, is it?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.068
A van matching
this description

10:11.069 --> 10:12.278
was involved
in an armed robbery.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.988
Wow.
Well, it wasn't this one.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.656
I've been stuck here
since about half-past

10:15.657 --> 10:16.907
waiting for a rescue.

10:16.908 --> 10:17.950
All right, the front's clear,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.785
but I can't really
see the back.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.830
Well, aren't you
a smile in a moor-gallop.

10:22.831 --> 10:23.956
Sir, I'm going to need
to see some ID.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.833
And I would love
to show you some,

10:25.834 --> 10:27.752
but I left the house
without my wallet.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.295
I barely remembered
to put on a shirt...

10:29.296 --> 10:30.963
if you can picture that.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.631
It happens to all of us.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.343
Well, then I'm gonna need
to see inside that van.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.344
No problem.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.970
Just a few bits and bobs
inside.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.638
You know, nothing of note.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.892
Which is a shame, really,
because something tells me

10:42.893 --> 10:45.853
being handcuffed by you
would be quite the treat.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.149
Yeah, sure.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.701
- What about the guns?
- Gotta write 'em off.

11:00.702 --> 11:01.786
<i>♪ Don't stop ♪</i>

11:01.787 --> 11:04.121
<i>♪ Why? ♪</i>

11:06.833 --> 11:09.835
Well, sir,
I think you got your fight.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.045
Happy?

11:11.046 --> 11:12.422
<i>♪ Why? ♪</i>

11:17.469 --> 11:19.095
My room looks bigger.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.721
Well, that's
'cause it's clean.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.099
Hi.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.683
- This the new Boot?
- Yeah.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.310
Tamara, Seth.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.686
It's a pleasure to meet you.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.315
What's up?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.859
Um...

11:33.860 --> 11:36.112
I got this on campus.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.780
Ooh, you worried
about cavities?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.952
They're Xanax
with a kick of ketamine.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.245
So I hear.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.413
I haven't tried it.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.206
These are
incredibly dangerous.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.791
You overdo it on these
and your heart stops.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.042
Where did you get these?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.377
My roommate's boyfriend.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.795
Said first one's free.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.046
Want me to make
an introduction?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.714
Yeah.
I mean, if you're up for it.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.426
We just have to find
a believable buyer.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.761
Somebody who is not a rookie.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.013
Whoever it is needs
to look like a college student.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.808
I can do it.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.478
Whoever it needs
to <i>look</i> like--

12:09.479 --> 12:11.480
Wow, okay.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.023
I get it. Thank you.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.359
I get carded
at movie theaters.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.902
I can do this.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.904
I'll introduce him
as my boyfriend.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.906
I'll say he goes to UCLA.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.742
Yeah, Tamara vouches for me,
I make the buy.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.870
Easy.

12:26.872 --> 12:27.788
Great.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.415
You can't do this, man.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.458
Look, I need
to talk to my wife.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.834
Shut up!

12:31.835 --> 12:33.169
You can't stay
in there forever!

12:33.170 --> 12:34.253
Shut up or I'll bust
your teeth out your mouth,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.504
you hear me?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.383
Did you just threaten
a suspect in police custody?

12:39.384 --> 12:41.010
He's an asshole!

12:41.011 --> 12:42.219
Yeah, he files a complaint
against the city and wins,

12:42.220 --> 12:43.512
he'll be a rich asshole.
That what you want?

12:43.513 --> 12:44.847
No, sir.

12:44.848 --> 12:45.848
Hey.

12:45.849 --> 12:46.975
What's up?

12:49.019 --> 12:51.854
There was a call back in
Texas my first year on the job.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.189
I didn't get there in time.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.276
He killed the kids too.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.195
Look.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.031
Those calls are hard
for all of us, all right?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.616
But crossing the line
gives guys like this

13:03.617 --> 13:07.119
a get-out-of-jail-free card,
and I know you don't want that.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.455
No, sir.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.833
I'll do better controlling
my emotions in the future.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.084
I saw that flawless
elbow strike

13:14.085 --> 13:15.794
that knocked the wind
out of him.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.921
Badass.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.381
I don't know.
Necessary, maybe.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.799
It's not the first time

13:20.800 --> 13:23.135
I have had
to defend myself from a man.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.304
It's why I do what
I do at the shelter.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.807
After my ex broke my rib,

13:28.808 --> 13:31.477
I swore never again.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.105
So now I am a blue belt
in Krav Maga,

13:35.106 --> 13:38.275
and it's the other guy
that has the broken rib.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.195
I'm a capoeira master
and a level one Krav Maga.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.488
For now.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.532
I thought I sensed
a kindred spirit.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.158
But you know, tough women,

13:46.159 --> 13:49.828
they often come
with dark stories.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.997
I just like
to learn new things.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.290
I see.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.501
Well, if you ever want
to talk martial arts,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.336
you know where to find me.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.463
Mm.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.550
Big guy's called the Hammer.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.510
His partner is Mickey Barnes.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.930
Their prints turned up at a gun
store robbery in Bakersfield.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.515
MO matches three other heists
in the area.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.350
They've been stealing guns
for the last four months.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.935
They planning
some kind of attack?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.228
They're not exactly planners.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.397
Most likely
they stole the guns to sell.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.566
At least they didn't
steal any more today.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.068
That isn't quite true,
though, is it?

14:21.069 --> 14:22.444
Uh, no, sir.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.946
They also got
the police-issue weapons

14:23.947 --> 14:25.197
in the back of the shop.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.116
And?

14:27.117 --> 14:28.617
And the ammo.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.411
And a police radio.

14:30.412 --> 14:33.372
A-and the onboard computer
and the vehicle itself.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.374
Officer Nolan,
remind me again

14:35.375 --> 14:38.043
how many times has
your shop been stolen?

14:38.044 --> 14:39.253
Twice.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.630
Sir, believe me,
I know how serious this is,

14:41.631 --> 14:43.048
and I will fix it.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.092
It wasn't entirely
Nolan's fault.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.470
Isn't this your last day
on probation, Officer Juarez?

14:48.471 --> 14:50.097
Was I saying anything?

14:50.098 --> 14:51.890
Sir, we will
get everything back.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.435
The tracker is still active
in the shop.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.894
We will chase it all down

14:55.895 --> 14:57.229
just as soon as we get
a temporary replacement.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.231
Don't lose that too.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.568
Officer Chen,
why do I hear you're Code-6

15:02.569 --> 15:03.569
<i>at your apartment?</i>

15:03.570 --> 15:05.237
Tamara came to me with a lead

15:05.238 --> 15:07.573
on a guy who's dealing ketamine
on a college campus,

15:07.574 --> 15:10.075
and I was wondering
if I had your permission

15:10.076 --> 15:12.202
to send Ridley
on an undercover buy.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.454
<i>You think he's ready?</i>

15:13.455 --> 15:15.247
Uh...

15:15.248 --> 15:18.042
yeah, I mean,
it's a simple hand-to-hand.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.085
He can do it.
- Okay, I trust your judgment.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.171
You'll need backup.
Grab Smitty.

15:22.172 --> 15:25.257
Oh, I was thinking maybe
Harper and Lopez?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.300
They're busy.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.468
<i>It's Smitty or no one.</i>

15:27.469 --> 15:28.595
Right.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.184
Yeah, that is them,
all right.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.061
Good news is,
they parked the shop

15:37.062 --> 15:39.271
right next to
the stolen weapons.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.524
Yeah, bad news is, they're
surrounded by stolen weapons.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.609
Yeah.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.527
So what's the play?

15:45.528 --> 15:46.987
Well, the last thing we want
is to get into a firefight.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.698
They're too well-armed.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.409
all: Oh.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.411
- Really?
- Ain't no harm in looking.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.247
Yeah, I'm referring
to the audible gasp.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.169
I say...

16:02.170 --> 16:03.337
We wait till they separate,

16:03.338 --> 16:05.130
then move in,
divide and conquer.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.007
Great.
How about we take Mickey.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.133
No.
Good try, Boot.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.302
<i>We</i> will take Mickey.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.096
You two get the Hammer.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.473
After this morning's debacle,
you two should be thanking us

16:14.474 --> 16:16.350
for giving you a chance
at redemption.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.352
Your thank you card's
in the mail.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.436
Can I just get
one quick peek?

16:19.437 --> 16:20.563
No.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.024
Oi, you done yet?

16:24.025 --> 16:25.734
Nearly.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.153
But I'd be a lot closer if you
got off your ass and helped.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.572
I just put on a clean shirt.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.324
But when you're done,
pull this people carrier out

16:32.325 --> 16:33.701
so I can back
that copper's motor in.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.036
And this one better run.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.371
That wasn't my fault.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.331
Dodgy Paul told me
it was top-of-the-line.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.708
Oh, and it never
occurred to you

16:40.709 --> 16:43.335
that a car thief named
Dodgy Paul might be lying?

16:52.721 --> 16:54.263
Hands up.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.347
Ooh.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.432
All right, lovely.
They're up.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.058
Turn around.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.059
Now it's getting kinky.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.394
Ooh.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.104
I do have a gun
in my right pocket.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.022
But I'm also happy to see you.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.233
Wow.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.234
Oh.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.457
Police! Hands up.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.376
Hello, sweetheart.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.044
You miss me?
- Hands on your head.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.088
Turn around.
Walk towards us nice and slow.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.090
I think we know what I'm
going to say to that, don't we?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.383
I'm unarmed.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.762
You can't shoot
an unarmed man, can you?

17:34.763 --> 17:38.515
You're right. We can't.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.564
Work smarter, not harder,
am I right?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.358
It's getting worse!

17:48.359 --> 17:50.195
Rubbing doesn't help!

17:54.240 --> 17:58.327
The dealer is Andy Hersh,
21 years old.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.079
This is a simple buy-walk deal.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.123
Buy drugs, walk away.
That's it.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.500
We will come back
for the arrest.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.126
We just need to get
the buy on the wire.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.503
There's also
the manufacturing arm.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.463
We need to know who's
importing the raw materials.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.757
No, no, no, no.
That's not today.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.258
Today, you buy and you walk.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.178
- Got it.
- Okay.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.222
That's him.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.107
Andy, hey!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.734
What's up?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.153
This is my boyfriend, Seth.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.321
He goes to UCLA.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.781
Oh, my condolences.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.116
Yeah, we keep
getting our asses kicked

18:38.117 --> 18:40.410
and Tam's telling me
that I got to transfer.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.412
Tam? Ew.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.413
It's cute.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.706
No, it's not.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.333
Well, life's better
on this side of town, so.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.459
That's what I hear.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.670
You got better teams.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.756
Better candy.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.216
I mean,
quality doesn't come cheap.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.717
It's not a problem.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.135
You know, only the best
for my girl, right?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.388
You're together.
We get it. Jeez.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.223
The kid's just selling it.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.141
Or maybe he's into her.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.309
Either way, what's the problem?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.395
He's--

19:06.396 --> 19:08.146
He's not right for her.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.314
Parenting is hard.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.732
But at some point,

19:10.733 --> 19:12.150
you gotta let the kids
spread their wings

19:12.151 --> 19:13.819
and make their own mistakes.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.737
Wait.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.738
Smitty, do you have kids?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.284
Do I?

19:20.285 --> 19:21.411
What?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.163
$300 a pop.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.254
Okay, you got the buy.
Now walk.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.465
Buy, walk, buy, walk. Jeez.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.342
Can you get more?

19:37.343 --> 19:38.844
What?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.596
I got a friend who's
throwing these parties

19:40.597 --> 19:42.723
and, you know,
he's always looking.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.808
Yeah, I can get as much
as he wants.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.268
Assuming he can pay.

19:46.269 --> 19:46.935
Yeah, I'll let him know.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.229
Cool.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.648
Good to see you.
- Yeah.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.949
You just opened the door
for a bigger bust.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.951
High five, kid.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.537
I can't believe we did that.
How are you so calm?

20:05.538 --> 20:06.830
Because I got a good partner.

20:06.831 --> 20:10.500
Ridley, it was risky
to push for more product.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.753
But it worked.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.632
I never should have
listened to Mickey.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.384
You can't pull a heist while
Mercury's in retrograde.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.594
And it's transiting Aries.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.387
You could not have
timed this worse.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.805
Exactly!

20:23.806 --> 20:25.807
Last time this happened,
my fiancée left me.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.935
Yeah, maybe she left you
because of the stars.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.811
Maybe it was all the arrests.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.939
Nah, she said
it was all the cheating.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.231
That'll do it.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.578
What? What?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.580
Go back to work.
Go back to work.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.332
He can't see you. Get to work.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.833
So just to be clear,
you still think that

20:51.834 --> 20:54.795
you're going to walk
on how many felonies?

20:54.796 --> 20:56.922
Three.
And so much evidence.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.716
I can't remember a time
we had this much evidence.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.593
Can you?
- Uh, let's see.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.595
Fingerprints,
surveillance video,

21:03.596 --> 21:06.765
eyewitness accounts,
body cam, shop cam, dash cam.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.267
I mean, it is
literally a mountain.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.938
Even if that were true,
you need me.

21:12.939 --> 21:13.981
Need you for what?

21:13.982 --> 21:15.941
To get to the bigger fish.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.943
We were supposed to deliver
those guns to the Butcher.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.947
So do you really want
to bust me,

21:21.948 --> 21:26.034
some street-level, cheeky,
little pirate...

21:26.035 --> 21:28.912
or do you want to take down
a real shot-caller?

21:28.913 --> 21:29.913
Hmm.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.581
It's compelling,

21:31.582 --> 21:34.334
but Mickey Barnes
is both snake and charmer.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.627
You of all people know

21:35.628 --> 21:38.338
my ability to sense
exaggeration is flawless.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.298
He's telling the truth.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.843
Okay. What's the timeline?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.803
Hammer and Mickey are
supposed to deliver the guns

21:44.804 --> 21:47.973
to the Butcher tomorrow.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.808
The DA's office can
offer reduced sentences

21:49.809 --> 21:52.644
if the LAPD can provide
full surveillance

21:52.645 --> 21:53.645
and arrest the Butcher.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.313
I'll authorize it.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.483
But we need to move Mickey
and the Hammer

21:58.484 --> 22:01.069
to a safe house tonight,
which means I need officers

22:01.070 --> 22:04.364
ready to transport
and work a graveyard.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.783
Uh, rumor mill says
Nolan is looking for anything

22:06.784 --> 22:09.494
to distract him
from his domestic situation.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.705
And I happen to know another
lonely senior officer

22:11.706 --> 22:13.749
happy to pick up
an extra shift.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.670
Checked and double-checked.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.006
Oh.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.383
Well, then that's it.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.720
You have reached the end
of your last day as a rookie.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.847
Oh,
I can't believe I made it.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.433
Thank you for everything.

22:31.434 --> 22:32.601
Being your training officer

22:32.602 --> 22:34.020
has been an honor
and a privilege.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.064
Officers!

22:37.065 --> 22:39.441
If I may have your attention
for a moment.

22:42.445 --> 22:43.987
Thank you.

22:43.988 --> 22:47.908
I am so proud to announce
that my rookie,

22:47.909 --> 22:50.452
Officer Celina Juarez,

22:50.453 --> 22:52.662
has successfully
reached the end

22:52.663 --> 22:56.041
of her POST-mandated training

22:56.042 --> 23:00.420
and has reached the capacity
of solo beat officer.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.547
Congratulations,
Officer Juarez.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.809
Thank you! Whoo!

23:23.611 --> 23:27.447
Oh, hi.
I was hoping I'd see you again.

23:27.448 --> 23:30.909
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said

23:30.910 --> 23:35.956
about tough women
having dark stories.

23:35.957 --> 23:41.086
I, um--I might have lied
in the ambulance earlier.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.421
We all do.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.174
It's the easiest way
to protect ourselves.

23:46.175 --> 23:49.761
I've been collecting ways
to protect myself for years.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.430
I fight fires, I shoot guns,
I jump out of planes,

23:52.431 --> 23:53.932
I save lives.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.100
Is it working?

23:55.101 --> 23:56.853
Yeah.

23:59.939 --> 24:04.151
- My ex was unimaginably cruel.
- Mm.

24:04.152 --> 24:07.779
He died trying to kill me.

24:07.780 --> 24:12.993
But he never hit me
while we were married.

24:12.994 --> 24:15.704
And even now,
I have a hard time

24:15.705 --> 24:18.790
labeling what
he put me through as abuse.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.208
Yeah.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.128
I never looked like
the women in a Lifetime movie.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.839
There were no black eyes,
no broken bones.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.508
Just a lot of gray area.

24:28.509 --> 24:29.801
Mm-hmm.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.804
Getting physical
in the bedroom,

24:32.805 --> 24:36.474
play that turned rough.

24:36.475 --> 24:40.478
No one knew I needed rescuing.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.480
So I rescued myself.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.691
But in the end, none of it
actually even mattered

24:44.692 --> 24:49.029
because my ex found me
and ripped my life apart again.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.822
And even now he's--

24:50.823 --> 24:54.159
he's dead, and he's still
haunting my marriage.

24:54.160 --> 24:58.747
My husband, who is the
greatest man I've ever known,

24:58.748 --> 25:03.168
isn't speaking to me because
of something I did out of fear.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.087
I was trying to protect myself.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.756
But if we don't work,

25:07.757 --> 25:10.717
my ex will have
taken everything from me.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.552
He would have won.

25:12.553 --> 25:15.096
Hey.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.518
He can't win.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.520
He's dead.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.231
You won.

25:24.232 --> 25:27.192
You got out alive
and you have all the power now.

25:27.193 --> 25:32.030
So yeah, you can talk about
what it was like for real.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.116
Gray areas included.

25:35.117 --> 25:38.286
Especially to this--
this husband of yours,

25:38.287 --> 25:41.957
you know,
that you love so much.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.875
He cannot help you heal

25:43.876 --> 25:46.211
if he doesn't know what's
still alive inside of you.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.637
Oi, does this thing
get the football?

25:55.638 --> 25:56.805
American?

25:56.806 --> 25:58.139
Ugh, savages.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.724
All right, boys.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.726
Doors and windows are locked,
the alarms are set.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.603
There's a patrol car in front
and behind the house.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.563
No one enters or leaves
until we depart

26:05.564 --> 26:07.148
for the weapon exchange
tomorrow morning.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.566
There is no internet,

26:08.567 --> 26:10.986
no contact with anyone
until after the handoff.

26:10.987 --> 26:12.737
Sergeant Bradford has
custody of the phone

26:12.738 --> 26:14.823
that you'll be using to
communicate with the Butcher.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.658
Are we clear on everything?

26:16.659 --> 26:18.243
What's the Hulu password?

26:18.244 --> 26:20.203
What part of no internet
do you not understand?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.579
I thought you lot had rules

26:21.580 --> 26:22.664
against cruel
and unusual punishment.

26:22.665 --> 26:23.832
Apparently not.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.919
Oh, this is going
to be a long night.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.630
Eh, beats going home
to an empty house.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.882
You and Bailey
still not talking?

26:32.883 --> 26:36.761
Oh, Hammer, got a couple
of sad coppers in here, mate.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.055
What happened, fella?
Catch your missus stepping out?

26:39.056 --> 26:40.265
Don't engage.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.975
Mate, give the poor sod
a break.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.185
A man's heartbreak is
no laughing matter.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.729
I wouldn't know.

26:45.730 --> 26:46.896
Tend to be the one
doing the breaking up,

26:46.897 --> 26:48.773
if you know what I mean.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.775
Weren't you getting engaged
last time I arrested you?

26:50.776 --> 26:52.277
Yeah, and then you
and that lady cop

26:52.278 --> 26:55.739
won the ring off of me
and everything fell apart.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.282
You won a ring off him?

26:57.283 --> 26:59.367
Randy pawned off Bailey's
ring the day of your wedding.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.786
Hammer bought it
and Lucy and I got it back.

27:01.787 --> 27:02.787
What?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.122
You're welcome.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.292
What?

27:07.293 --> 27:09.294
<i>- Babe, we need wine out here.
- On it.</i>

27:09.295 --> 27:13.131
So James and I are
supposed to talk tonight,

27:13.132 --> 27:17.093
and I just can't do it again.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.970
You know,
it's like I start talking

27:18.971 --> 27:22.807
and then he starts talking,
and fundamentally, we agree.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.976
Policing in this country
should be better.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.729
But then
we get into the details

27:27.730 --> 27:29.731
and all of a sudden
we don't agree

27:29.732 --> 27:31.316
and then it's a fight

27:31.317 --> 27:34.069
and we don't even know
how we got there.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.653
Thank you, Wesley.
- No problem.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.697
But it comes with
a little unsolicited advice.

27:37.698 --> 27:38.907
Oh, God.

27:38.908 --> 27:39.991
No, no. This is good.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.785
Please, I need
a man's perspective.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.371
Hmm.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.122
Okay.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.332
Generally speaking,

27:47.333 --> 27:49.000
we're simple,
straightforward creatures.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.668
And we do like to talk,

27:50.669 --> 27:52.295
but that talk has
to have an endgame.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.173
We're working it out, great.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.800
But what did we decide,
you know?

27:56.801 --> 27:58.343
Like, what's the plan?

27:58.344 --> 28:01.346
And James doesn't have to
change his position or tactics

28:01.347 --> 28:04.015
because philosophically,
you agree with him.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.435
So it's on me
to do something.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.187
Actions speak louder
than words.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.856
Basic guy code.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.234
<i>Look at him.
He can't take it.</i>

28:14.235 --> 28:17.737
<i>Soft little--</i>

28:17.738 --> 28:19.030
Perimeter's secure.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.490
Ingress and egress have
been double-checked.

28:20.491 --> 28:23.868
Sheriff's office is still
posted out front and out back.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.704
Good.
The burner phone's quiet.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.749
I suspect the Butcher
won't reach out until morning.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.042
I can, uh, take first watch

28:31.043 --> 28:32.293
if you want to get
some shut-eye.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.711
I don't sleep when
I'm on shift.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.713
But go ahead. You look wrecked.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.341
Yeah, hard to sleep when
she's not there.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.885
Um, can I ask you
a personal question?

28:40.886 --> 28:42.429
Usually I'd say no,

28:42.430 --> 28:44.389
but I've been working on being
more emotionally available,

28:44.390 --> 28:46.434
so shoot.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.312
How did you, um--

28:51.313 --> 28:54.399
with Isabel, how did you know
when it was over?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.943
I didn't.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.069
Not for a long time.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.362
You know, it turns out

28:59.363 --> 29:00.905
you can only fracture something
so many times

29:00.906 --> 29:03.074
before it's impossible
to put back together.

29:03.075 --> 29:08.037
Problem is, I didn't
realize that until I had tried.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.748
You're saying the only way
I can...

29:10.749 --> 29:12.917
know for sure that it's over
is to try and fix it?

29:12.918 --> 29:14.085
If that's what you want.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.253
We're both so dug in,

29:15.254 --> 29:17.797
I don't see how
we can move forward.

29:17.798 --> 29:18.965
One step at a time.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.508
And maybe you're right, okay?

29:20.509 --> 29:23.761
Maybe things between
you and Bailey can't be fixed.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.097
But don't make the same mistake
I did with Lucy

29:26.098 --> 29:28.766
and quit before
the battle's done.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.060
If you love her, fight.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.189
Otherwise, you might
spend the rest of your life

29:34.190 --> 29:37.400
wondering if you
could have done more.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.825
You are one hour away
from being a full-fledged cop.

29:45.826 --> 29:49.120
How do you feel?
- Mm, good, I think.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.789
Mostly. A-and also not.
- Mm.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.124
You know, being a rookie

29:53.125 --> 29:54.292
was one of the hardest things
I've ever done.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.002
And as a reward for passing,

29:56.003 --> 29:58.963
I get to keep doing it
for 30 years.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.882
Yay!

30:02.426 --> 30:04.052
Mm.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.057
What?

30:09.058 --> 30:12.810
Tamara and Seth are
on a date?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.230
They'd be so cute!

30:15.231 --> 30:18.483
That's a bad thing.
How could they?

30:18.484 --> 30:20.193
Where do we even start?

30:20.194 --> 30:23.112
It's like ice cream Jenga.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.532
UCLA.

30:25.533 --> 30:28.993
So boss man Javi
wants to meet you.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.204
Great. Um, cool.

30:31.205 --> 30:32.539
Anytime.
- Great.

30:32.540 --> 30:33.456
Get in the car.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.044
Sorry, guys.
He's mine tonight.

30:38.045 --> 30:41.089
- So come.
- No.

30:41.090 --> 30:44.468
This ice cream was, like, $30,
and somebody's gotta eat it.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.347
Don't worry. I'll be back.
I promise.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.988
Mm.

31:04.989 --> 31:07.115
Hey, are you with Seth?
I saw that photo.

31:07.116 --> 31:10.076
I mean, I was,
but he just left with Andy.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.203
Stop.
Andy from the drug buy?

31:12.204 --> 31:14.038
<i>Yeah, um,
he had a couple guys</i>

31:14.039 --> 31:15.373
<i>and said Javi wanted to talk.</i>

31:15.374 --> 31:17.375
I took a picture of the plate
just in case.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.294
Okay.
And--and Seth went with them?

31:19.295 --> 31:21.546
<i>Yeah. I mean, they just
think he's a buyer, right?</i>

31:21.547 --> 31:23.131
He'll be okay.

31:23.132 --> 31:25.466
He has his police ID on him
and his off-duty weapon.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.552
<i>If they search him, it's over.</i>

31:43.444 --> 31:44.402
Hey, what's up?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.154
Hey, uh, Seth is in trouble

31:46.155 --> 31:47.947
and I was hoping that

31:47.948 --> 31:49.073
you could help me and Celina
get him out of it.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.575
We're tracking a license plate.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.619
I'm on a safe house detail
tonight with Nolan.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.287
Let me get an officer
to replace me.

31:54.288 --> 31:55.330
Text me your location.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.585
Your shift doesn't start
for 20 minutes.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.669
Lucy called.

32:01.670 --> 32:02.962
Seth's in trouble.
They need backup.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.213
I'm going to call the station

32:04.214 --> 32:05.423
to have a replacement officer
brought in.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.424
Get two. I'll go with you.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.134
The handoff isn't for hours.

32:08.135 --> 32:09.135
Where's Mickey?

32:09.136 --> 32:10.428
In the loo.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.514
I'm gonna move him along.

32:15.351 --> 32:17.436
Mickey, let's go.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.065
Mickey, I'm coming in.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.034
Tim?

32:35.245 --> 32:36.287
What's going on?

32:36.288 --> 32:37.288
Do not move.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.456
Is there a problem?

32:38.457 --> 32:39.624
Where's Mickey?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.125
Get down on the floor.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.251
Like hell I will.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.629
Hammer, do not push me.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.382
I need you in cuffs
so I can check on my sergeant.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.092
You need to tell me
what's going on.

32:49.093 --> 32:50.343
Where's Mickey?

32:50.344 --> 32:51.678
Hammer.

32:51.679 --> 32:54.138
Ooh, get his gun.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.974
Hammer, if you take one step,
I will shoot you.

32:56.975 --> 33:01.104
Mickey, what
in God's name are you doing?

33:01.105 --> 33:02.313
I'm going to get us
out of here.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.065
But we've made a deal
with the coppers.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.983
And I made a different deal,
all right?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.110
With my lawyer.

33:07.111 --> 33:08.111
The Butcher's
going to set us up.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.112
What if I don't want

33:09.113 --> 33:10.154
to get set up with the Butcher?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.698
I like the sound of WITSEC.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.075
A fresh start,
a new chance at love.

33:14.076 --> 33:16.035
Man, I don't have
time for this.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.578
You owe me.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.330
Now get his gun and tune
him up a little, all right?

33:19.331 --> 33:21.416
You like fighting cops.
Knock him around. Let's go.

33:21.417 --> 33:22.750
He's gonna shoot me!

33:22.751 --> 33:23.751
No, he isn't.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.044
Yes, I am.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.462
He shoots you,
I shoot his partner.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.673
Shoot 'em both.
Don't worry about me.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.757
Now, that's
just unreasonable.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.592
Listen, use your nut.

33:31.593 --> 33:34.011
There is no reason anyone
needs to get shot, okay?

33:34.012 --> 33:38.182
So Hammer,
will you get his damn gun?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.350
Uh...

33:39.351 --> 33:41.269
no, I want my deal.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.193
Can't believe you just
did me dirty like that.

33:49.194 --> 33:52.280
Well, next time you change
the plan, you talk to me.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.198
Well, here he is.

33:57.619 --> 34:02.290
Hammer, seriously, thank you.

34:02.291 --> 34:03.500
Turn around.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.047
Javi has to be Javi Rosio.

34:10.048 --> 34:13.050
He has a history of importing
and pressing Xanax.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.385
Okay.
What's his last-known address?

34:14.386 --> 34:17.221
45th and Fig.
Javi is a career criminal.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.474
He'll definitely search Seth
when he arrives.

34:19.475 --> 34:23.060
Yeah, we need to stop them.
Um...

34:23.061 --> 34:24.353
you know what?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.820
God, I love this song, man.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.241
Hey, man, you know I can
totally drive if you want.

34:42.372 --> 34:44.123
Ah, you're kidding me.

34:44.124 --> 34:45.500
All right.

34:45.501 --> 34:47.336
All right, be easy, guys.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.181
- Evening.
- Yeah, how's it going?

35:02.601 --> 35:05.187
- License and registration.
- Yeah, sure thing.

35:09.733 --> 35:12.109
That's not mine.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.196
Turn off the vehicle.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.451
Let's go.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.494
Can--can you just please
not tell my parents?

35:21.495 --> 35:23.204
My dad is gonna kill me.

35:23.205 --> 35:24.664
Sure, kid.

35:24.665 --> 35:25.748
Thanks.

35:25.749 --> 35:26.749
In you go.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.380
Hey.

35:32.381 --> 35:33.714
Hi.

35:33.715 --> 35:37.218
Thank you for the rescue.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.386
Thank Tamara.

35:38.387 --> 35:39.637
She told us what
we needed to find you.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.430
Yeah.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.182
Yeah, it's a good thing
we were hanging out, huh?

35:43.183 --> 35:44.643
I wouldn't say that.

35:46.436 --> 35:51.691
Hey, can you get
these things off me?

35:51.692 --> 35:54.318
I'm sorry.
I don't have any keys on me.

35:59.867 --> 36:01.826
Ah. Heard things got a
little rough at the safe house.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.327
Yeah, thanks
for volunteering us.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.204
Thanks for the middle-
of-the-night wake-up call.

36:05.205 --> 36:06.873
Are the Butcher's guys
in interrogation?

36:06.874 --> 36:08.207
Ready and waiting
for you to flip them,

36:08.208 --> 36:09.166
get an arrest warrant
for the Butcher,

36:09.167 --> 36:10.293
and take all the glory.

36:10.294 --> 36:12.837
Oh, it's good
to be detective.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.339
I'll be right there.
Hey, do you have a minute?

36:15.340 --> 36:16.674
Of course.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.384
Okay, so
I've been thinking about

36:18.385 --> 36:21.220
putting feet to all this talk
about policing with James.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.638
If I were to start
a group of cops

36:22.639 --> 36:25.308
who were dedicated to reform,
would anyone join?

36:25.309 --> 36:26.475
Absolutely.

36:26.476 --> 36:27.852
You might make
a few enemies too.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.186
Oh, I don't care about that.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.521
Great.
Let me be the first to sign up.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.772
Do we get a secret handshake?

36:31.773 --> 36:33.399
No. There is nothing secret
about this.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.859
The whole point
is to put a public face

36:34.860 --> 36:36.652
on change from within.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.905
Right. May I recommend
matching T-shirts?

36:38.906 --> 36:40.531
- No.
- Think about it.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.533
How's Seth?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.660
Yeah, yeah, he's great.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.829
Um, I need to talk to you
about something.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.206
About how weird you were
about us hanging out?

36:49.207 --> 36:52.543
Look, Tamara,
you don't know Seth like I do.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.920
What does that mean?

36:53.921 --> 36:56.839
He lies a lot.
Like, habitually.

36:56.840 --> 36:57.965
He's training to be a cop.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.842
I know, and--
and I'm working on that.

36:59.843 --> 37:03.346
But the point is...

37:03.347 --> 37:04.347
you can't date him.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.390
I--I can't?

37:06.391 --> 37:07.309
Uh--

37:08.477 --> 37:09.727
I--I misspoke, all right?

37:09.728 --> 37:11.855
I just think that--
- It's not up to you.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.734
What was that about?

37:16.735 --> 37:19.570
Well,
she has a thing for Seth

37:19.571 --> 37:22.907
and I tried to warn her about
him and it did not go well.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.241
You want me to put the
fear of Bradford in him?

37:24.242 --> 37:25.993
Yeah.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.578
No.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.665
No, that would just
make things worse.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.627
Ma'am?

37:34.628 --> 37:36.671
Officer Miles Penn.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.756
I responded to the incident at
your shelter yesterday morning.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.384
Of course.
Um, call me Diana, please.

37:41.385 --> 37:45.429
Um, thank you
for your prompt response.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.599
It looked like you had things
pretty well under control.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.435
I did until I didn't.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.813
Ugh, one of
the most frustrating things

37:53.814 --> 37:57.316
about being a woman is that
no matter how--

37:57.317 --> 38:00.444
how strong,
how skilled I become,

38:00.445 --> 38:04.407
an angry 200-pound man will
always have the upper hand.

38:04.408 --> 38:05.741
Well, that's--
that's actually why I'm here.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.493
If you're interested,

38:07.494 --> 38:10.454
I would like to offer my
services to you free of charge

38:10.455 --> 38:12.957
as a security guard
for your shelter

38:12.958 --> 38:14.542
or the downtown women's center.

38:14.543 --> 38:16.377
When I'm off-duty, that is.

38:16.378 --> 38:20.589
That's an incredibly
generous offer.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.718
I just don't want
to see another woman get hurt.

38:23.719 --> 38:25.720
Neither do I.

38:25.721 --> 38:28.472
<i>♪ To dance you out
to the garden ♪</i>

38:28.473 --> 38:33.436
<i>♪ Where this bloom,
it stays... ♪</i>

38:33.437 --> 38:36.856
I have coffee, wine,
or a sleep aid,

38:36.857 --> 38:39.483
depending on your vibe.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.735
I love you.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.695
And I'm sorry I had
to run out last night.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.363
It's all good.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.824
I know who I married.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.909
And I love you too.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.621
So I'm doing a thing.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.457
I realized it was time

38:54.458 --> 38:56.500
for me to put my money
where my mouth is,

38:56.501 --> 39:00.671
so I talked to Grey,
and he has given me approval

39:00.672 --> 39:05.342
to start a police
accountability advocacy group

39:05.343 --> 39:07.636
within the station
so that cops who believe that

39:07.637 --> 39:09.680
changes in policing
are necessary

39:09.681 --> 39:12.558
can work together
to be that change.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.561
And I hope you don't mind,
but I have

39:15.562 --> 39:19.107
volunteered you to be
our chief community liaison.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.612
Of course I don't mind.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.906
But won't that cause trouble
for you down at the station?

39:26.907 --> 39:28.491
I have been undercover
with cartels,

39:28.492 --> 39:29.992
so those cops don't scare me.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.078
So let's get to it.

39:32.079 --> 39:35.706
What is first on the agenda?

39:35.707 --> 39:41.921
Well, uh, by far the most
important action item...

39:41.922 --> 39:43.547
is this.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.557
Hey.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.727
Do you want some coffee?
I made a pot.

39:56.728 --> 40:01.732
Uh, no, thank you, I'm good.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.611
Right, this is the part where
I explain why I'm here.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.696
If you want.

40:07.697 --> 40:10.783
Or we could just sit.

40:10.784 --> 40:15.871
No, I want to explain.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.124
There's a lot that
I haven't told you

40:18.125 --> 40:20.626
about my marriage to Jason.

40:20.627 --> 40:23.587
Not because I wanted
to keep secrets from you.

40:23.588 --> 40:29.093
I was in denial about
a lot of my experiences.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.845
And I made
a new friend recently

40:30.846 --> 40:36.600
who helped me see that
denial is no longer serving me.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.770
And reminded me that
you are the best ally

40:39.771 --> 40:43.607
to help me face what happened
and heal it.

40:43.608 --> 40:47.444
For years,
I've only acknowledged

40:47.445 --> 40:50.614
the emotional abuse
Jason put me through

40:50.615 --> 40:53.701
because it kept me out
of the battered wife category,

40:53.702 --> 40:57.204
but when he escalated
to framing me,

40:57.205 --> 41:01.959
stalking me,
and trying to kill me,

41:01.960 --> 41:04.795
so did I.

41:04.796 --> 41:09.175
Malvado was a desperate move
for safety.

41:09.176 --> 41:12.678
I was--I was scared.

41:12.679 --> 41:16.807
So scared that it--
it broke me.

41:16.808 --> 41:21.104
And I did a stupid thing.

41:23.565 --> 41:26.150
And then
I made you feel judged.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.569
Instead of supported.

41:28.570 --> 41:32.781
I wish I could go back and
do it all over again and...

41:32.782 --> 41:34.992
show you that the fear

41:34.993 --> 41:39.038
I was feeling about that phone
was for you...

41:39.039 --> 41:41.165
for the danger
you put yourself in.

41:41.166 --> 41:45.044
But all I can do is apologize.

41:45.045 --> 41:47.713
For making you feel alone,
because you are not alone.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.180
You're loved.

41:56.181 --> 42:00.267
Now I know how we fix this.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.102
The answer's together, right?

42:02.103 --> 42:03.520
Yes.

42:03.521 --> 42:07.107
Come here.

42:07.108 --> 42:10.027
Mm.

42:51.111 --> 42:51.820
<i>Damn it.</i>
