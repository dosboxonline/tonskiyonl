00:14.291 --> 00:16.833
from the short story by
ROALD DAHL

00:26.666 --> 00:30.916
[bell tolling in the distance]

00:39.250 --> 00:42.458
In the afternoon,
the rat man came to the petrol station.

00:42.541 --> 00:45.458
He sidled up the driveway
with a soft, stealthy gait.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.875
His feet made no noise at all
on the gravel.

00:47.958 --> 00:50.541
He had an army knapsack
slung over one shoulder.

00:50.625 --> 00:53.291
He wore an old-fashioned corduroy jacket
with large pockets.

00:53.375 --> 00:57.041
Corduroy trousers were tied around
the knees with lengths of white string.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.208
- Hello?
- Yes?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.166
Rodent operative.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.000
His small, dark eyes
moved swiftly over the premises.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.291
- The rat man?
- That's me.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.291
He was lean, leathery, a sharp face,

01:05.375 --> 01:06.875
two long, sulfur-yellow teeth

01:06.958 --> 01:09.375
protruding from the upper jaw
over the lower lip.

01:09.458 --> 01:12.416
His ears were round and thin,
set near the back of his head.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.875
The eyes were almost black,

01:13.958 --> 01:17.166
but when they looked at you,
there was a flash of yellow in them.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.958
- You've come quick.
- Special orders from the Health Office.

01:20.041 --> 01:22.041
And now
you're going to catch all the rats?

01:22.125 --> 01:23.041
- Yeah.
- How?

01:23.125 --> 01:23.958
Yes. How?

01:24.041 --> 01:27.250
Depends what rats, where they is.
Different methods for different rats.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.625
- Trap them, I suppose.
- What?

01:28.708 --> 01:29.625
- Trap 'em.
- Trap 'em?

01:29.708 --> 01:30.708
The rat man snorted.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.750
Won't catch 'em that way.
Rats ain't rabbits.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.083
He held his face up high,

01:34.166 --> 01:37.791
sniffing the air with a nose that
twitched perceptibly from side to side.

01:37.875 --> 01:41.250
Rats is clever. You wanna catch 'em,
you gotta know 'em.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.000
You gotta know rats on this job.

01:47.291 --> 01:49.625
You know what they do? They watch you.

01:49.708 --> 01:52.250
Whole time you're preparin'
how to exterminate 'em,

01:52.333 --> 01:53.416
they're watchin' you.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.291
This ain't a sewer job, is it?

01:55.375 --> 01:56.958
No, it's not a sewer job.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.500
- Tricky things, sewer jobs.
- I shouldn't think so.

01:59.583 --> 02:02.666
You shouldn't, should you?
I'd like to see you do a sewer job.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.416
Just exactly how'd you set about it,
I'd like to know.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.666
Poison them, I suppose.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.916
And where exactly
would you put the poison?

02:09.000 --> 02:09.833
Down the sewer?

02:09.916 --> 02:11.416
The rat man sparkled, triumphant.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.208
Yeah, I knew it. "Down the sewer."

02:13.291 --> 02:15.625
Know what'd happen?
Get washed away completely.

02:15.708 --> 02:17.625
All your poison. Sewer's like a river.

02:17.708 --> 02:20.875
All right. Well, what would you do,
Mr. Rat Man? On a sewer job?

02:20.958 --> 02:22.750
The rat man advanced a step closer.

02:22.833 --> 02:25.000
His voice became secretive
and confidential,

02:25.083 --> 02:27.750
the voice of a man
divulging professional secrets.

02:27.833 --> 02:30.916
You works on the understandin'
a rat is a gnawin' animal, see?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.458
Anythin' you give 'em, they gnaws on it.

02:33.541 --> 02:36.583
So you got a sewer job on your hands.
What d'you do?

02:36.666 --> 02:39.500
His voice had the soft,
throaty sound of a croaking frog,

02:39.583 --> 02:42.666
and he seemed to speak all his words
with a wet-lipped relish,

02:42.750 --> 02:44.708
as if they tasted good on the tongue.

02:44.791 --> 02:45.875
You go down the sewer

02:45.958 --> 02:48.416
and you take along
some ordinary brown paper bags

02:48.500 --> 02:51.166
filled with plaster of paris powder.
Nothin' else.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.583
Then you suspend 'em
from the roof of the sewer

02:53.666 --> 02:56.041
so they hangs down
not quite touchin' the water.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.125
Just high enough so a rat can reach 'em.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.625
Claud was listening, rapt.

02:59.708 --> 03:03.916
Old rat comes swimmin' along the sewer,
sees the bag. He stops.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.583
[sniffs] Takes a sniff at it.
It don't smell so bad.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.166
- What's he do?
- He gnaws it.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.208
That's it! He starts gnawin' at the bag,
and the bag breaks,

03:11.291 --> 03:14.708
and the old rat
gets a mouthful of powder for his pains.

03:14.791 --> 03:15.625
Well?

03:15.708 --> 03:17.000
Well, that does him.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.125
- That kills him?
- Stone dead.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.458
- Plaster of paris…
- It swells when you wet it.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.750
Gets into the rat's tubes
and swells right up

03:23.833 --> 03:26.375
and kills him
quicker than anythin' in the world.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.166
That's where you got to know rats.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.291
His face glowed with a shifty pride.

03:30.375 --> 03:34.291
He rubbed his stringy fingers together,
holding the hands up close to his face.

03:35.875 --> 03:38.250
Now, where's them rats?

03:38.333 --> 03:40.791
The word "rats" came out
with a rich, fruity sound

03:40.875 --> 03:43.000
as if he were gargling with melted butter.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.666
In the hayrick across the road.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.125
- Not inside?
- Only in the hayrick. Nowhere else.

03:47.208 --> 03:51.625
I'll wager they're inside too,
gettin' in your food, spreadin' disease.

03:51.708 --> 03:54.958
- Got any sickness here?
- He looked pointedly at me, then at Claud.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.541
- Everyone's well.
- Quite sure?

03:56.625 --> 03:58.250
- Quite sure.
- You never know.

03:58.333 --> 04:01.083
He'd taken upon himself
the mantle of a public health officer,

04:01.166 --> 04:03.916
disappointed we were not suffering
from bubonic plague.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.500
Nevertheless, the rats are in the hayrick.
How will you remove them?

04:07.583 --> 04:09.833
The rat man grinned a crafty, toothy grin.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.333
He reached into his knapsack
and withdrew a large tin,

04:12.416 --> 04:14.833
weighing it up and down
in his hands as he spoke.

04:14.916 --> 04:17.291
Poison. Special poison. Deadly poison.

04:17.375 --> 04:21.041
They'd put you inside if they caught you
with even a spoonful of this.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.333
There's enough here to kill a million men.

04:23.416 --> 04:24.750
- Want to see?
- Yes, please.

04:24.833 --> 04:27.000
He took a penny and prized open the lid.

04:27.083 --> 04:27.916
There it is.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.583
He spoke almost lovingly of the stuff
and held it forward for Claud.

04:31.666 --> 04:33.208
[Claud] Corn or barley, is it?

04:33.291 --> 04:35.666
Oats. Oats soaked in deadly poison.

04:35.750 --> 04:39.416
You take just one grain in your mouth
and you're a goner in three minutes.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.541
Never out of me sight, this tin.

04:41.625 --> 04:43.958
[editor] He caressed the tin and shook it…

04:44.041 --> 04:47.083
- [rat man mimics rattle]
- …so the oat grains rustled softly inside.

04:47.166 --> 04:50.458
But your rats don't get this today.
They wouldn't have it, anyway.

04:50.541 --> 04:54.833
That's where you got to know rats.
Rats is suspicious. Terrible suspicious.

04:54.916 --> 04:57.458
So today they get
some nice, clean, tasty oats

04:57.541 --> 04:59.375
as will do 'em no harm in the world.

04:59.458 --> 05:02.208
Fatten 'em up, that's all.
And tomorrow, the same again.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.625
And the day after that,
and the day after that.

05:04.708 --> 05:07.375
And it'll taste so good,
all the rats in the district

05:07.458 --> 05:09.166
will be comin' along soon enough.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.083
Very clever.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.041
You got to be clever on this job,
cleverer than a rat.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.583
And that's saying something.

05:14.666 --> 05:16.791
"You've almost got to be a rat yourself."

05:16.875 --> 05:18.708
It slipped out before I could stop myself.

05:18.791 --> 05:21.416
I couldn't help it,
I was looking at him at the time.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.250
The effect it had on him was surprising.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.291
- That's it!
- …he cried.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.500
Now you got it, you really said somethin'.

05:26.583 --> 05:29.541
A good ratter's gotta be
more like a rat than anythin' else.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.166
Cleverer even than a rat,

05:31.250 --> 05:33.958
and that is not an easy thing to be,
let me tell you.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.291
Well, let's get on with it.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.583
Lady Leonora Benson's
asking for me urgent up at the manor.

05:39.666 --> 05:40.750
She's got rats too?

05:40.833 --> 05:42.666
Everybody's got rats.

05:42.750 --> 05:45.041
The rat man ambled off down the driveway.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.958
The way he walked was so like a rat,
it made you wonder.

05:48.041 --> 05:51.625
That slow, almost delicate, ambling walk
with a lot of give at the knees

05:51.708 --> 05:54.625
and no sound at all
from his footsteps on the gravel.

05:54.708 --> 05:57.833
He hopped over the gate,
and walked quickly 'round the hayrick,

05:57.916 --> 06:00.416
scattering handfuls of oats
onto the ground.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.083
The next day he returned
and repeated the procedure.

06:03.166 --> 06:06.083
The day after that he came again,
and the day after that,

06:06.166 --> 06:09.500
and finally, on the fourth day,
he put down the poisoned oats.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.958
But he didn't scatter these.
Instead, he placed them in little piles

06:13.041 --> 06:14.875
at each corner of the hayrick.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.041
- You got a dog?
- [Claud] Yes.

06:19.125 --> 06:23.000
Well, if you want him to die a horrible,
twisting death, let him in that gate.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.166
The next day he came to collect the dead.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.958
Get me an old sack.
I'm gonna need one to put 'em in.

06:28.041 --> 06:31.541
He was puffed up and important now,
the black eyes gleaming with pride.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.875
He was about to display
the results of his catch to the audience.

06:34.958 --> 06:37.833
Claud fetched a sack
and we walked across the road.

06:37.916 --> 06:39.625
The rat man prowled around the hayrick,

06:39.708 --> 06:42.500
bending over to inspect
one of his piles of poison.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.458
- Something wrong here.
- …he muttered.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.000
His voice was soft and angry.

06:46.083 --> 06:49.500
He ambled over to another pile
and got down to examine it closely.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.041
- Something wrong here.
- [Claud] What's the matter?

06:52.125 --> 06:55.208
He didn't answer, but it was clear
the rats hadn't touched his bait.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.416
"These are very clever rats here," I said.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.666
The rat man was annoyed

06:58.750 --> 07:02.208
and showed it on his face and nose
and by the way the two yellow teeth

07:02.291 --> 07:04.208
were pressing into his lower lip.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.791
- Don't give me that crap.
- …he said, looking at me.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.708
Nothing's wrong with these rats,
somebody's feedin' 'em.

07:09.791 --> 07:12.541
They got somethin' juicy
to eat somewhere, plenty of it.

07:12.625 --> 07:16.708
No rats in the world will turn down oats
unless their bellies is full to burstin'.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.416
The rat man turned away, sullen.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.000
He knelt down again scooping up
the poisoned oats with a small shovel,

07:22.083 --> 07:24.250
tipping it carefully back into a tin.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.916
When he had finished, all three of us
walked back across the road.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.125
The rat man stood by the petrol-pump,

07:31.208 --> 07:32.916
a rather sorry, humble rat man now

07:33.000 --> 07:35.666
whose face was beginning
to take on a brooding aspect.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.083
He had withdrawn into himself
over his failure,

07:38.166 --> 07:39.541
the eyes veiled and wicked,

07:39.625 --> 07:42.875
the little tongue darting out
to one side of the two yellow teeth.

07:42.958 --> 07:45.083
He looked up at me,
a surreptitious glance,

07:45.166 --> 07:46.125
then over at Claud.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.208
His nose-end twitched, sniffing the air.

07:48.291 --> 07:51.291
He raised himself up and down
on his toes, swaying gently,

07:51.375 --> 07:53.916
and in a soft voice,
soft and secretive, he said…

07:54.000 --> 07:55.333
You want to see something?

07:55.416 --> 07:57.708
He was trying to retrieve his reputation.

07:57.791 --> 07:59.875
- What?
- You want to see something amazing?

07:59.958 --> 08:03.000
He put his right hand
into the poacher's pocket of his jacket

08:03.083 --> 08:06.625
and brought out a large, live rat
clasped tight between his fingers.

08:06.708 --> 08:07.625
Good God!

08:07.708 --> 08:09.250
[chuckles] That's it. You see?

08:09.333 --> 08:12.000
He was crouching slightly
and craning his neck forward

08:12.083 --> 08:15.000
and leering at us and holding
this enormous brown rat,

08:15.083 --> 08:18.083
one finger and thumb making
a tight circle around its neck,

08:18.166 --> 08:20.500
clamping its head
so it couldn't turn and bite.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.416
Do you go around
with rats in your pockets?

08:22.500 --> 08:24.458
Always a rat or two about me somewhere.

08:24.541 --> 08:28.083
He put his free hand into the other pocket
and produced a small, white…

08:28.166 --> 08:30.708
- Is that a ferret?
- The rat man snickered, hissing.

08:30.791 --> 08:33.500
The ferret seemed to know him
and stayed still.

08:33.583 --> 08:35.875
Nothing will kill a rat
quicker than a ferret.

08:35.958 --> 08:38.208
He held the two animals
close in front of him

08:38.291 --> 08:41.541
so the ferret's nose
came within six inches of the rat's face.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.208
The pink beady eyes of the ferret
stared at the rat.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.000
The rat struggled,
trying to edge away from the killer.

08:47.083 --> 08:48.208
- Now.
- …he said.

08:48.291 --> 08:49.125
Watch.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.000
[editor] His khaki shirt
was open at the neck,

08:53.083 --> 08:55.500
and he lifted the rat
and slipped it down inside,

08:55.583 --> 08:56.708
next to his skin.

08:56.791 --> 08:59.708
His belt prevented the rat
from going lower than his waist.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.375
He slipped the ferret in next.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.333
Immediately, there was
a great commotion inside the shirt.

09:04.416 --> 09:08.000
It appeared the rat was running around
his body, chased by the ferret.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.833
Six or seven times they went around,
the small bulge chasing the larger one,

09:11.916 --> 09:15.000
gaining on it slightly each circuit,
drawing closer and closer

09:15.083 --> 09:17.708
until at last the two bulges
seemed to come together,

09:17.791 --> 09:20.500
and there was a scuffle
and a series of shrill shrieks.

09:20.583 --> 09:23.750
Throughout this performance,
the rat man stood absolutely still,

09:23.833 --> 09:26.041
legs apart, arms hanging loosely,

09:26.125 --> 09:29.166
dark eyes resting calmly
on Claud's frozen face.

09:30.041 --> 09:33.750
Finally, he took his hand
and reached down into his shirt

09:33.833 --> 09:35.500
and pulled out the ferret.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.958
With the other, he took out the dead rat.

09:38.041 --> 09:41.250
There were traces of blood
around the white muzzle of the ferret.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.791
"Not sure I liked that very much," I said.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.791
You never seen nothin' like it before,
I'll bet you that.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.166
Can't say I have.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.916
You'll get a nasty nip
in the guts one of these days.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.833
…Claud told him, but was intrigued,
and the rat man was becoming cocky again.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.041
You want to see something
far more amazing?

09:58.125 --> 10:01.208
Something you'd never believe unless
you're seeing it with your own eyes?

10:01.291 --> 10:03.833
I glanced at Claud
more than slightly apprehensive.

10:05.875 --> 10:06.708
Yes.

10:07.458 --> 10:09.583
The rat man slipped
the dead rat into one pocket

10:09.666 --> 10:10.916
and the ferret into the other.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
Then he reached into his knapsack
and produced a second live rat.

10:15.083 --> 10:15.916
Holy Christ!

10:16.000 --> 10:18.291
Always got one or two rats
about me somewhere.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.041
You got to know rats on this job,

10:20.125 --> 10:22.708
and if you wanna know 'em
you gotta have 'em around.

10:22.791 --> 10:26.375
This is a sewer rat, this one.
An old sewer rat, clever as buggery.

10:26.458 --> 10:30.000
See him watchin' me all the time,
wonderin' what I'm gonna do next?

10:30.083 --> 10:31.416
- See him?
- Most unpleasant.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.750
"What will you do?"

10:32.833 --> 10:36.166
I had a feeling I'd like
this demonstration less than the last one.

10:36.250 --> 10:39.333
- Fetch me a piece of string.
- Claud fetched a piece of string.

10:39.416 --> 10:41.791
The rat man
looped it around the rat's hind leg.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.666
The rat struggled,
but the rat man held it tight.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.291
Now, you got a table inside?

10:46.375 --> 10:48.333
"We don't want the rat inside," I said.

10:48.416 --> 10:50.791
Well, I need a table.
Or somethin' flat, anyway.

10:50.875 --> 10:54.125
We walked over to the petrol-pump
and he put the sewer rat on top.

10:54.208 --> 10:57.708
He attached the string to a post
so the rat was now tethered.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.250
At first, it crouched,
unmoving and suspicious,

11:00.333 --> 11:02.583
a big-bodied gray rat
with bright black eyes

11:02.666 --> 11:06.166
and a scaly tail that lay in a long curl
on the metal surface.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.750
It was looking away,
but watching him sideways

11:08.833 --> 11:10.416
to see what he was going to do.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.166
The rat man stepped back a few paces,
and immediately the rat relaxed.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.625
It sat up on its haunches

11:15.708 --> 11:17.958
and began to lick
the gray fur on its chest.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.583
Then it scratched its muzzle
with both front paws.

11:20.666 --> 11:23.875
It seemed quite unconcerned
about the other men standing nearby.

11:23.958 --> 11:26.333
- How about a little bet?
- [editor] …the rat man said.

11:26.416 --> 11:27.875
"No, thank you." I said.

11:27.958 --> 11:31.375
- [rat man] It's more fun if you bet.
- [Claud] What do you want to bet on?

11:31.458 --> 11:34.250
[rat man] I can kill that rat
without using my hands.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.458
I'll put 'em in my pockets
and not use 'em.

11:36.541 --> 11:39.250
[editor] It was apparent the rat man
was out to earn some money.

11:39.333 --> 11:42.625
I looked at the rat that was to be killed
and began to feel sick,

11:42.708 --> 11:44.625
not because it was going to be killed,

11:44.708 --> 11:47.166
but because it was to be killed
in a special way,

11:47.250 --> 11:49.333
with a considerable degree of enthusiasm.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.000
- No arms?
- No arms, no legs, no hands neither.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.708
- You'll sit on it.
- No squashing.

11:55.791 --> 11:57.583
- Let's see it.
- Bet me a quid first.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.500
Don't be bloody daft. Why should we?

11:59.583 --> 12:01.208
- What'll you bet?
- Zero. Nothing.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.166
All right. Then it's a no-go.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.625
- He made as if to untie the string.
- I'll bet a shilling.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.666
The sick sensation in my stomach
was increasing.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.375
But there was an awful magnetism
about this business.

12:10.458 --> 12:12.875
I found myself
unable to walk away or even move.

12:12.958 --> 12:13.916
- You too?
- No.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.708
Want me to do this for a shilling?

12:15.791 --> 12:17.750
- I don't want you to do it.
- Where's the money?

12:17.833 --> 12:19.625
Claud put a shilling on the petrol-pump.

12:19.708 --> 12:22.500
The rat man laid two sixpences
beside Claud's money.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.416
Bet's on.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.750
Claud and I stepped back.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.458
The rat man stepped forward,
put his hands in his pockets

12:27.541 --> 12:29.916
and inclined his body
from the waist toward the rat.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.583
The rat was crouching, alarmed.

12:31.666 --> 12:34.250
It seemed it was preparing
to spring at the rat man,

12:34.333 --> 12:36.041
but then it began to reverse away,

12:36.125 --> 12:38.500
dragging its body backwards
with crouching steps

12:38.583 --> 12:40.708
until the string tautened on its hind leg.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.916
The rat man
leaned further towards the rat,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.583
following it back and forth
with his eyes. Suddenly…

12:45.666 --> 12:48.291
- It panicked.
- …it panicked and leapt into the air.

12:51.166 --> 12:54.875
The string pulled it up with a jerk
that must've nearly dislocated its leg.

12:54.958 --> 12:56.458
It crouched again at the edge,

12:56.541 --> 12:59.416
as far away as the string would allow,
whiskers quivering,

12:59.500 --> 13:01.291
the long gray body rigid with fear.

13:01.375 --> 13:04.750
At this point, the rat man again
began to move his face very slowly,

13:04.833 --> 13:05.958
closer and closer.

13:06.041 --> 13:09.166
I wanted to cry out for him to stop,
but I couldn't speak.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.750
Something extremely unpleasant
was about to happen, I was sure of that.

13:12.833 --> 13:16.291
Something sinister and cruel,
but I had to see it now.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.666
Not more than the length of a man's hand
was separating the two.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.458
The rat pressed its body flat,
tense and terrified.

13:22.541 --> 13:23.916
The rat man was also tense,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.500
but with a dangerous active tensity
that was like a tight-wound spring.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.125
The shadow of a smile
flickered around the skin of his mouth.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.041
Then, suddenly, he struck,

13:32.125 --> 13:33.166
as a snake strikes,

13:33.250 --> 13:36.000
darting his head forward
with a swift knife-like stroke…

13:36.083 --> 13:38.125
…that originated in the muscles
of the lower body…

13:38.208 --> 13:40.750
[editor] …and I had a glimpse
of the mouth opening wide…

13:40.833 --> 13:41.875
…two yellow teeth…

13:41.958 --> 13:45.208
[both] …the whole face contorted
by the effort of mouth-opening.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.875
More than that, I did not care to see.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.291
I closed my eyes,
and when I opened them again,

13:50.375 --> 13:51.416
the rat was dead,

13:51.500 --> 13:54.041
the rat man
was slipping the money into his pocket

13:54.125 --> 13:55.750
and spitting to clear his mouth.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.875
And that's what
they makes licorice out of.

13:59.958 --> 14:03.875
Rat's blood's what the big factories
and chocolate-makers use to make licorice.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.083
Nothin' wrong with a drop of rat's blood.

14:08.791 --> 14:10.541
You are absolutely disgusting.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.083
But that's it, you see.
You eaten it many a time.

14:13.166 --> 14:16.250
Penny sticks and licorice bootlaces
all made from rat's blood.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.458
We don't want to hear
another word, thanks.

14:18.541 --> 14:21.291
Boiled up in great cauldrons,
bubblin' and steamin'

14:21.375 --> 14:23.416
and men stirrin' it with long poles.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.958
One of the big secrets
of the chocolate factories,

14:26.041 --> 14:29.875
and no one knows about it,
except the ratters supplyin' the stuff.

14:29.958 --> 14:32.875
Suddenly he noticed his audience
was no longer with him.

14:32.958 --> 14:36.083
Our faces were hostile
and sick-looking and crimson with anger.

14:36.666 --> 14:39.458
He stopped and turned away
without another word.

14:39.541 --> 14:44.125
We watched as he sloped onto the road
with a slow, delicate, ambling walk.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.083
His footsteps didn't make a sound,
not even on the gravel.

14:55.958 --> 14:57.708
[bell tolling in the distance]

15:00.375 --> 15:01.208
Strange.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.041
The rats never ate the poisoned oats.

15:05.375 --> 15:09.291
There must be
something nutritious in the hayrick.

15:14.541 --> 15:16.625
[wind blowing]
