WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:02.828
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.872 --> 00:04.178
MADI'S SKETCHBOOK.
HE KNEW THAT

00:04.221 --> 00:06.528
SHE STILL HAS THE MEMORIES
OF THE COMMANDER.

00:06.571 --> 00:09.313
SHE WOULD NEVER
BE SAFE.

00:09.357 --> 00:10.749
DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.012
I'M SORRY.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.665
UNH!

00:13.709 --> 00:15.058
SHEIDHEDA: IT SEEMS
YOU'RE THE KEY

00:15.102 --> 00:17.321
TO THE TRANSCENDENCE
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.931
THEY GAVE ME
A CHOICE--

00:18.975 --> 00:21.282
USE THESE TO BRING
YOU BACK PEACEFULLY

00:21.325 --> 00:24.111
OR THIS IF YOU
WOULDN'T GO WILLINGLY.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.895
AGH! UNH!

00:25.938 --> 00:27.679
MADI: SHEIDHEDA GOT AWAY.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.508
HE STABBED HIMSELF
IN THE GUT AND DISAPPEARED.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.206
RAVEN: THE STONE'S HERE.
IT CAN'T PINPOINT

00:32.249 --> 00:34.034
THE EXACT LOCATION.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.339
CADOGAN WILL JUST
KEEP SENDING
MORE PEOPLE

00:35.383 --> 00:36.601
UNTIL HE GETS ME.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.734
NO ONE ELSE IS DYING
TO SAVE ME.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.609
MILLER: BOMB!

00:48.178 --> 00:49.484
UNH!

01:18.339 --> 01:20.776
EMORI?

01:20.819 --> 01:22.038
EMORI!

01:26.434 --> 01:28.262
EMORI, ANSWER ME!

01:28.305 --> 01:29.698
RAVEN, DISTORTED:
MURPHY!

01:29.741 --> 01:31.352
MURPHY,
ARE YOU OK?

01:31.395 --> 01:33.093
I CAN'T FIND EMORI.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.616
-WHERE WAS SHE?
-SHE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!

01:34.659 --> 01:36.748
SHE WAS RIGHT--
SHE WAS RIGHT THERE.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.794
HEY, HEY. YOU'RE
PROBABLY CONCUSSED.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.317
HOW MANY FINGERS
AM I HOLDING?

01:40.361 --> 01:41.884
TOO MANY. WE NEED
TO FIND EMORI NOW.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.190
IF SHE WAS WITH YOU,
SHE WON'T BE FAR.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.539
WE'LL WORK A GRID.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.195
MURPHY: EMORI, EMORI,
SAY SOMETHING!

01:51.589 --> 01:53.548
EMORI: SOMETHING.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.988
MURPHY: WE GOT YOU,
WE GOT YOU.
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!

02:05.168 --> 02:06.996
THANK GOD. I THOUGHT YOU...

02:12.828 --> 02:14.830
WERE HURT.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.266
WHAT, THIS?

02:19.530 --> 02:21.141
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.178
MILLER: JAX, WE'RE COMING!

03:14.281 --> 03:16.108
WE CAN STILL GET
TO MADI.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.203
CLARKE, WE HAVE TO
THINK THIS THROUGH.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.378
OCTAVIA: GAIA'S RIGHT.

03:24.421 --> 03:27.207
ONLY THE SECOND PILL'S
FOR ME.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.773
WE'RE GONNA NEED
AN INSIDE MAN.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.474
CLARKE: GOOD.
LET'S DO IT.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.745
CADOGAN DISAPPEARED
RIGHT AWAY.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.616
WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING?

03:45.660 --> 03:47.531
HOPE: MAYBE SOMEBODY
HAS TO BE WAITING
IN BARDO

03:47.575 --> 03:49.229
TO PULL YOU THROUGH.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.543
UNH!

04:04.896 --> 04:07.464
AAH!

04:07.508 --> 04:08.900
CLARKE.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.511
WE HAVE TO GET TO MADI!

04:10.554 --> 04:13.601
CADOGAN COULD BE DIGGING
INTO HER BRAIN RIGHT NOW.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.255
AAH!

04:23.306 --> 04:24.699
SIR.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.745
AND YOU MUST BE
MADI.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.181
MY NAME'S LEVITT.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.748
SO GLAD YOU'VE CHOSEN
TO JOIN US.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.927
IT'S OK. JUST HAVE
A SEAT RIGHT HERE.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.369
I KNOW IT LOOKS SCARY,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.935
IT WON'T HURT.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.546
PAIN INTERFERES
WITH THE READINGS.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.910
IT'S NOT TOO BAD.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.129
GOOD. JUST LAY
YOUR HEAD BACK

05:04.173 --> 05:05.914
AND GET COMFORTABLE.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.590
WE'RE GONNA START
BY GOING THROUGH
A BASELINE SCENARIO.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.680
IMAGINE YOU'RE
IN AN ENDLESS DESERT

05:32.723 --> 05:34.986
WITH A VAST, PURPLE SKY.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.728
A HAND REACHES OUT
FOR YOUR OWN.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.469
WHOSE IS IT?

05:47.085 --> 05:49.523
HOLOGRAM MODE.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.176
NEURAL LINK ENGAGED.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.533
CADOGAN:
WELL DONE, MADI.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.448
I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID,

06:01.491 --> 06:04.668
BUT IF YOUR MIND CONTAINS
THE FINAL CODE,

06:04.712 --> 06:06.453
IT'LL ALL BE WORTH IT.

06:06.496 --> 06:07.889
MADI: YOU'RE WRONG.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.243
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:14.286 --> 06:17.115
GABRIEL SAID JORDAN
STUDIED THE TEXTS.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.382
YOU THINK IT'S A WAR
BECAUSE YOU WANT A WAR...

06:24.122 --> 06:27.517
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A TEST
SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.606
CADOGAN: I AM SORRY,
BUT I FIND IT UNLIKELY

06:29.650 --> 06:32.783
THAT A BOY WHO STUDIED
THE TEXTS ONCE

06:32.827 --> 06:35.307
KNOWS BETTER THAN THOSE
OF US WHO HAVE SPENT

06:35.351 --> 06:37.179
GENERATIONS WITH THEM.

06:37.222 --> 06:40.400
THAT SAID, TRANSLATION
IS AS MUCH AN ART

06:40.443 --> 06:42.706
AS SCIENCE.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.709
AFTER ALL, WHAT IS WAR
BUT A TEST

06:45.753 --> 06:49.974
OF MIGHT AND WILL?

06:50.018 --> 06:54.414
SO IF JORDAN IS RIGHT
AND IT IS A TEST

06:54.457 --> 06:59.375
OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL,
THEN...THAT'S A GOOD THING.

07:01.029 --> 07:04.380
MADI, I DON'T WANT A WAR.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.296
I DON'T WANT TO SEND
MY CHILDREN TO DIE.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.559
IF I COULD SPARE ALL
OF US THE PAIN

07:09.603 --> 07:13.563
OF FIGHTING, THEN
I WELCOME THAT TEST.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.482
FORGIVE THE INTERRUPTION,
MY SHEPHERD.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.179
WE RECEIVED A SIGNAL
FROM EARTH.

07:21.223 --> 07:25.140
TWO NANO-TAGS
HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.708
MADI'S PEOPLE ARE
NO DOUBT WORRIED
ABOUT HER,

07:27.751 --> 07:29.666
BUT SHE'LL BE WITH
THEM SOON ENOUGH.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.321
FOR NOW, LEAVE
THEM THERE.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.279
THEY'LL THANK US
AFTER WE'VE
TRANSCENDED,

07:34.323 --> 07:35.933
TAKING THEM WITH US.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.156
LEVITT: READY TO BEGIN.

07:43.332 --> 07:46.509
-YOU DOING OK, MADI?
-YES.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.032
I WANT TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.736
THINK BACK
TO THIS IMAGE.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.961
IS THE SYSTEM
MALFUNCTIONING?

08:04.005 --> 08:06.877
NO, SIR. JUST GIVE
ME A MOMENT.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.016
MADI, I NEED YOU
TO BE VERY STILL NOW.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.366
I'M GOING DEEPER.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.977
JUST FOCUS
ON THE DRAWING.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.153
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
REMEMBER ABOUT HER?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.987
NOTHING. I--I DON'T KNOW.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.348
CADOGAN:
DON'T WORRY, MADI.

08:43.392 --> 08:46.134
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT
TOGETHER.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.788
I'M NOT DOING THIS
FOR YOU.

08:47.831 --> 08:53.228
I'M DOING THIS
TO SAVE MY FRIENDS,
MY FAMILY.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.882
YOU'RE VERY BRAVE.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.974
LEVITT: SIR, IT'S STRANGE.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.976
THIS PARTICULAR MEMORY
IS NOT REGISTERING

09:02.019 --> 09:05.457
IN ANY OF THE AREAS THAT
MEMORIES ARE USUALLY STORED.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.938
SHE DREW THINGS THAT
SHE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN.

09:07.982 --> 09:11.594
THOSE MEMORIES ARE
IN HER MIND SOMEWHERE.

09:11.638 --> 09:15.206
SIR, I WOULD HAVE TO
SEARCH MUCH DEEPER
THAN JUST THE CORTEX.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.906
IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS,
AND I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.

09:18.949 --> 09:22.518
THEY TELL ME
YOU'RE THE BEST.
I TRUST YOU.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.998
FOR ALL MANKIND.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.841
MY INSIDE MAN IS SURE
TAKING HIS SWEET TIME.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.712
INDRA: WE SHOULD DISCUSS
THE PLAN.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.540
CLARKE AND OCTAVIA
BRING US OVER.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.543
WE GET MADI AND KILL
THEIR LEADER.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.980
GAIA: KILLING CADOGAN
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.113
HE CAN'T CHASE US
IF HE'S DEAD.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.811
YOU'VE SEEN FAITH,
MOTHER.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.900
YOU KILL THE COMMANDER,
ANOTHER TAKES HER PLACE.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.076
YOU KILL THE FLEIMKEPA,
ANOTHER TAKES HIS PLACE.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.905
FAITH DOESN'T JUST DIE.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.603
IT GETS CARRIED
FORWARD.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.822
CADOGAN'S PEOPLE
ARE NO DIFFERENT.

10:05.866 --> 10:09.217
THEN HOW DOES THIS END?

10:09.260 --> 10:12.002
OCTAVIA: BELLAMY ASKED
THAT QUESTION, TOO.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.744
ONE LAST WAR,

10:14.788 --> 10:17.442
AND THEN WE TRANSCEND
AND WE BECOME THE LIGHT.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.270
JORDAN:
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA,

10:19.314 --> 10:21.969
BUT FIGHTING IS NOT
HOW WE GET THERE.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.928
WAR IS A FAILURE
OF EVERYTHING,

10:24.972 --> 10:28.018
WHICH IS WHY
IT'S A TEST, NOT A WAR.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.499
HOPE: TEST, WAR,
TEST, WAR.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.632
THE DISCIPLES
HAVE BEEN STUDYING

10:32.675 --> 10:35.722
THE BARDO TEXTS
FOR OVER 1,000 YEARS.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.419
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU KNOW BETTER?

10:37.462 --> 10:39.421
YES.

10:39.464 --> 10:43.599
AND IT'S NOT JUST
THAT I READ SOME OLD BOOKS.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.428
I FELT IT.

10:47.908 --> 10:52.695
THAT RED SUN TOXIN
SHOWED ME SOMETHING.

10:52.739 --> 10:57.221
I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT,
BUT I KNEW IT WAS IMPORTANT,

10:57.265 --> 11:00.094
AND THEN I READ
THE BARDO TEXTS,

11:00.137 --> 11:01.835
AND IT HIT ME--

11:01.878 --> 11:04.576
THE NEXT STEP
IN HUMAN EVOLUTION.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.146
I DON'T CLAIM TO
FULLY UNDERSTAND IT,

11:09.190 --> 11:13.847
BUT...IN MY HEART,
I KNOW THERE'S
A PURPOSE TO EVERYTHING,

11:13.890 --> 11:15.675
AND WE DON'T FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS

11:15.718 --> 11:19.766
BY KILLING EACH OTHER
IN ANOTHER WAR.

11:19.809 --> 11:23.117
I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE
TOLD BELLAMY.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.901
CLARKE: NONSENSE.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.816
ALL THAT MATTERS NOW
IS SAVING MADI

11:26.860 --> 11:28.775
AND KILLING CADOGAN.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.994
THERE'S NO LAST WAR
OR TEST.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.735
BELLAMY'S DEAD BECAUSE
HE BELIEVED THAT CRAP,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.345
AND I'VE HEARD ENOUGH!

11:43.267 --> 11:45.400
WHAT THE HELL WAS
MADI THINKING?

11:45.443 --> 11:47.750
SHE JUST LEFT WITHOUT
EVEN TALKING TO ME.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.665
SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE ELSE I KNOW.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.755
NO. ALL I EVER DID WAS
TRY TO SAVE PEOPLE.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.845
WHILE PUTTING YOURSELF
IN DANGER.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.377
SHE'S DOING WHAT I DID.

12:07.857 --> 12:10.904
TRYING TO FIX EVERYTHING
ON HER OWN.

12:13.036 --> 12:17.258
IS THIS HOW MY MOM FELT
EVERY TIME?

12:17.301 --> 12:21.566
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH AIR.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.484
DID I DO THAT TO HER?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.054
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

12:31.098 --> 12:34.405
AND I'M SURE YOUR
MOTHER KNEW THAT

12:34.449 --> 12:36.799
JUST AS MADI DOESN'T
MEAN TO HURT YOU.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.548
IT'S NOT EASY
LOVING SOMEONE

12:46.591 --> 12:50.770
WHO PUTS THEIR OWN
LIFE AT RISK.

12:50.813 --> 12:54.643
MADI WENT TO BARDO
TO SAVE US.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.645
I'M PROUD OF HER
FOR THAT.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.042
I KILLED BELLAMY
TO PROTECT HER

13:02.085 --> 13:04.914
FROM THE DISCIPLES,

13:04.958 --> 13:07.569
NOT SO SHE COULD TURN
HERSELF IN.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.704
EVERYONE I LOVE DIES.

13:17.884 --> 13:22.192
I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS,
NOT AGAIN.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.810
IF I LOSE MADI, TOO...

13:33.508 --> 13:35.336
I'LL HAVE NOTHING...

13:39.906 --> 13:41.472
BE NOTHING.

13:42.952 --> 13:46.042
I CAN SHOW YOU HOW
TO STILL YOUR MIND

13:46.086 --> 13:48.131
IF YOU LET ME,
CLARKE.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.707
MURPHY: THIS SIDE,
THIS SIDE, THIS SIDE.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.187
OK.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.015
EMORI: AAH! MY LEG!

14:02.058 --> 14:03.581
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL US?

14:03.625 --> 14:07.324
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL IT.
NOW I DO.

14:07.368 --> 14:10.023
OVER HERE. EASY.

14:11.851 --> 14:16.333
IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.945
IT'S OK, IT'S OK.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.337
JACKSON: THE REBAR
CAN WAIT.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.730
SHE'S LOSING
TOO MUCH BLOOD.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.514
I DON'T THINK IT SEVERED
THE ARTERY,

14:23.558 --> 14:25.908
BUT WE NEED TO
CAUTERIZE THE WOUND.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.475
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.955
I JUST WISH I HAD
A PROPER ANESTHETIC FOR YOU.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.218
NOT AS MUCH AS SHE DOES.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.828
IT'S FINE, JOHN.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.830
MURPHY, PUT PRESSURE
ON THIS.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.701
UNH!

14:36.745 --> 14:39.487
HOW ABOUT YOU
DISTRACT ME?

14:45.188 --> 14:47.234
YOU'RE SMASHED,
AND THEN WE'RE LAYING DOWN

14:47.277 --> 14:49.671
ON KAYLEE'S GIANT BED,

14:49.714 --> 14:52.500
DRINKING JO JUICE,
JUST YOU AND ME.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.937
YOU HATED PLAYING
PRIMES.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.679
YEAH, BUT YOU LOVED IT.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.463
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.291
YEAH, I DID LOVE IT.

15:04.860 --> 15:09.125
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT I MATTERED.

15:09.169 --> 15:12.433
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.914
YOU ALWAYS MATTERED TO ME.

15:18.526 --> 15:21.398
HEY. YOU READY?

15:25.315 --> 15:27.665
YEAH.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.015
WHEN I SAY SO,

15:29.058 --> 15:30.930
YOU UNCOVER THE WOUND,
ALL RIGHT?

15:33.410 --> 15:36.936
3, 2, 1, GO.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.203
MURPHY: IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER!

15:43.246 --> 15:44.726
-IT'S OVER.
-OK.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.032
YOU DID SO GOOD.
YOU JUST GOT TO HANG ON

15:46.075 --> 15:47.294
WITH US NOW, OK?

15:47.337 --> 15:49.339
RAVEN: HEY.
I HEARD SCREAMING.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.559
DID YOU FIND ECHO

15:51.602 --> 15:53.256
OR ANY SIGN
OF THE OTHERS?

15:53.300 --> 15:54.997
NO. WHATEVER THAT
EXPLOSION WAS,

15:55.041 --> 15:56.738
THE HALLWAY IS
COMPLETELY COLLAPSED.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.696
FOR NOW, WE ASSUME
THEY'RE OK,

15:58.740 --> 16:00.916
BUT I WAS ABLE TO GET
INTO THE INFIRMARY.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.875
THIS IS ALL I COULD FIND.
MAYBE IT WILL HELP.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.965
I CAN'T DO SURGERY
OUT OF MY PACK.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.749
I NEED AN ACTUAL
SURGICAL THEATER,

16:07.792 --> 16:09.490
STERILE EQUIPMENT,
MEDICINE.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.927
I NEED TO GET TO SANCTUM.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.973
THE HELMET SHOWED ME
THE STONE WAS
IN THE REC ROOM.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.627
WE FIND IT, OPEN THE BRIDGE,
AND JUMP OVER.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.194
WHAT ABOUT MADI?

16:18.238 --> 16:20.457
WHAT ABOUT THE REST
OF OUR FRIENDS?

16:20.501 --> 16:23.112
WE WILL WORRY
ABOUT THEM LATER.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.809
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE
THE PRIORITY.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.898
YEAH. DAMN RIGHT.

16:26.942 --> 16:29.989
WE ONLY HAVE ONE PROBLEM.
WE COULDN'T FIND THE STONE.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.731
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
SEE SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S NOT THERE.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.759
MURPHY: WHY IS THERE
AN AZGEDA SYMBOL
ON THE FLOOR?

17:01.803 --> 17:03.370
DON'T KNOW,
DON'T CARE.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.981
ALL I KNOW IS "X"
MARKS THE SPOT.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.245
EMORI: UNH. JOHN,
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.730
RAVEN: I'LL GET THE GEAR.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.298
HEY, HEY. STAY WITH US.
STAY WITH US, ALL RIGHT?

17:18.341 --> 17:21.562
ECHO'S AZGEDA. YOU SHOULD BE
WORRIED ABOUT HER, TOO.

17:21.605 --> 17:22.998
I AM.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.652
YOU'RE NOT ACTING
LIKE IT.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.132
MURPHY: LOOK. EVERYONE ELSE
CAN TAKE CARE

17:26.175 --> 17:29.483
OF THEMSELVES FOR
A LITTLE WHILE, ALL RIGHT?

17:29.526 --> 17:33.748
YOU ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANY OTHER PERSON
IN THIS UNIVERSE.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.881
JACKSON: MURPHY, I
NEED TO REPACK THIS.

17:36.925 --> 17:40.972
HEY, THOR. LET'S GO.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.626
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.111
I HATE TO SAY THIS,

17:49.155 --> 17:51.244
BUT IF WE DON'T GET HER
TO SANCTUM SOON,

17:51.287 --> 17:53.072
SHE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.861
-AGH!
-AAH!

18:01.602 --> 18:02.820
AAH!

18:09.218 --> 18:11.786
CALLIE: LET'S JUST SAY
HE BELIEVES HE CAN
WALK ON WATER.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.744
BECCA: AND YOU DON'T?

18:13.788 --> 18:16.225
CALLIE: I BELIEVE
IN YOU.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.922
NO.

18:17.966 --> 18:21.012
NO. BRING IT BACK.
BRING IT BACK!

18:21.056 --> 18:22.797
LEVITT: I'M TRYING.
IT'S JUST A FRAGMENT.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.886
I HAD TO ACTIVATE
THE EXTRA-SYNAPTIC
GABA RECEPTORS

18:24.929 --> 18:26.540
JUST TO GAIN ACCESS.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.932
IT'S AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT PATHWAY

18:27.976 --> 18:29.151
FROM NORMAL MEMORIES.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.631
NO EXCUSES.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.330
I WANT TO SEE
MY DAUGHTER AGAIN.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.948
IF I PUSH DEEPER,
I MAY BE ABLE TO FIND MORE

18:43.992 --> 18:46.212
OF BECCA'S MEMORIES,

18:46.255 --> 18:48.170
BUT IT'S RISKY.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.824
THEN BE CAREFUL.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.783
WE NEED HER MEMORIES
INTACT.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.442
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MADI?

18:59.486 --> 19:02.489
I KNOW. YOU'RE TIRED,

19:02.532 --> 19:04.273
BUT YOU'RE DOING
SO WELL.

19:17.678 --> 19:20.202
ALIE WILL GET
THE FLAME EITHER WAY.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.204
NONE OF US...

19:22.248 --> 19:24.206
IS READY FOR THIS.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.034
I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

19:26.077 --> 19:29.080
BECCA: READY FOR THIS.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.039
NONE OF--NONE OF US.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.520
NONE OF US
IS READY.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.478
WE'RE NOT READY.

19:35.522 --> 19:36.610
I AM.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.351
WE'RE NOT READY.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.961
NOT YOU.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.876
ESPECIALLY--
ESPECIALLY NOT YOU.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.225
NO!

19:45.227 --> 19:46.359
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:46.402 --> 19:48.578
I SAW EVERYTHING.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.232
BECCA WENT
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.495
SHE SAID HE'S NOT READY.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.542
I'M DONE HELPING YOU.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.284
BECCA AND I HAD
A DISAGREEMENT

19:58.327 --> 20:01.591
A LONG TIME AGO.

20:01.635 --> 20:05.073
YOU'RE ONLY SEEING
HER SIDE OF THE STORY,

20:05.116 --> 20:07.510
AND SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
RIGHT BACK THEN,

20:07.554 --> 20:10.731
BUT I'VE SPENT
CENTURIES PREPARING US,
IMPROVING US.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.126
NOW IS OUR TIME.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.476
LEVITT: LET'S START AGAIN.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.609
I SAID NO!

20:19.653 --> 20:21.002
MADI, STOP IT. YOU'RE
HURTING YOURSELF.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.439
-GUARDS!
-YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF!

20:23.483 --> 20:26.181
CADOGAN: RESTRAIN HER!
WE CAN'T LET HER HARM HERSELF.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.530
GUARD: STEP ASIDE,
DISCIPLE LEVITT.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.489
TAKE IT EASY!
STOP RESISTING.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.882
YOU'LL ONLY GET HURT.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.276
CADOGAN: AGAIN,
MR. LEVITT.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.061
SIR, WE NEED TO
DO THIS ANOTHER WAY.

20:37.105 --> 20:40.195
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THIS.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.892
YOU'RE DISMISSED.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.981
GUARD: HOLD HER DOWN!
CADOGAN: SUMMON SHOANA.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.462
YES, SIR.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.862
MADI:
LEAVE ME ALONE! AAH!

20:54.905 --> 20:56.298
GUARD: FOR ALL MANKIND.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.143
GUARD: LEVITT DEPARTING
M-CAP.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.762
MADI, STOP THIS.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.590
ARE YOU TRYING TO
KILL YOURSELF?

21:29.853 --> 21:31.638
FOR THE GOOD OF THE MANY,

21:31.681 --> 21:35.511
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO CONTINUE.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.208
GO FLOAT YOURSELF.

21:45.695 --> 21:48.002
-LEVITT.
-I JUT CAME FROM THE SHEPHERD.

21:48.045 --> 21:51.310
THE NANO-TAGS FROM EARTH,
HE WANTS THOSE PEOPLE
BROUGHT OVER.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.356
-NOW.
-I THOUGHT HE ORDERED US

21:54.400 --> 21:55.792
TO IGNORE THEM.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.490
I SUPPOSE HE CHANGED
HIS MIND.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.754
WHO AM I
TO QUESTION THAT?

22:00.797 --> 22:03.452
FINE. I'LL GO TELL
THE SHEPHERD THAT YOU
REFUSED HIS ORDER.

22:03.496 --> 22:06.368
HE CAN COME HERE
HIMSELF.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.240
WAIT.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.634
BRINGING THEM OVER.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.288
IT'LL TAKE ME
A FEW MINUTES

22:13.332 --> 22:14.985
TO RELINK
TO THEIR TAGS.

22:20.382 --> 22:23.472
FOCUS ON YOUR BREATH.

22:23.516 --> 22:28.216
IN...AND OUT.

22:28.259 --> 22:33.308
LET ALL EARTHLY CONCERNS
FALL AWAY.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.267
THIS MIGHT WORK
FOR THE COMMANDERS,

22:36.311 --> 22:39.793
BUT MINE IS THE ONLY VOICE
IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW,

22:39.836 --> 22:42.230
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR
WHAT IT HAS TO SAY.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.232
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A COMMANDER TO FIND

22:44.275 --> 22:45.799
THE STILLNESS
IN YOUR MIND,

22:45.842 --> 22:47.540
BUT YOU DO HAVE
TO TRY.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.717
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW

22:50.760 --> 22:53.415
WHEN MY DAUGHTER IS
OUT THERE,

22:53.459 --> 22:55.069
PROBABLY BEING TORTURED
RIGHT NOW?

22:55.112 --> 22:57.114
YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW THAT?

23:00.117 --> 23:02.816
I LOVE HER, TOO,
CLARKE.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.601
I KNOW.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.516
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.616
IT'S WORKING.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.139
I'M NEXT.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.273
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ALONE AGAIN.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.449
SOMETIMES TO DO
THE RIGHT THING,

23:27.493 --> 23:28.885
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
A RISK.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.452
YOUR MOM KNEW
THAT, TOO.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.121
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.258
WHAT NOW?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.658
NOW WE HAVE FAITH.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.752
WHERE ARE THEY?

24:09.796 --> 24:11.537
WHERE'S THE BRIDGE?
WHAT IS THIS?

24:11.580 --> 24:14.104
WAR PREPARATIONS.
WE MOVED THE BRIDGE

24:14.148 --> 24:16.498
TO A STRATEGICALLY
ADVANTAGEOUS LOCATION.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.328
WHERE?

24:51.490 --> 24:55.537
NO. NO.

24:55.581 --> 24:59.802
MAN: DROP YOUR WEAPONS!
HANDS IN THE AIR!

24:59.846 --> 25:02.544
DIFFERENT MAN: HOLD YOUR FIRE.

25:18.995 --> 25:21.781
THE GAUZE SHOULD KEEP
THE BLEEDING UNDER CONTROL

25:21.824 --> 25:24.261
UNTIL WE GET YOU
INTO SURGERY.

25:24.305 --> 25:25.915
COME ON, JACKSON.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.526
WE BOTH KNOW
HOW THIS ENDS.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.919
HEY. DON'T TALK
LIKE THAT.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.182
WE ARE GETTING YOU
OUT OF HERE.

25:32.226 --> 25:33.923
-AGH!
-FASTER, RAVEN.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.795
YOU TRY DOING THIS
ONE GOOD LEG.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.449
AGH! UNH!

25:38.493 --> 25:40.756
I'M GOING TO HELP THEM.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.106
YOU HANG IN THERE.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.284
UGH!

25:47.328 --> 25:49.286
YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.
I CAN TAKE OVER.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.071
I'M FINE.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.769
I NEED
YOU TO TALK
TO EMORI.

25:56.076 --> 25:59.470
RECOVERY IS PSYCHOLOGICAL
AS MUCH AS IT IS MEDICAL.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.298
SHE THINKS SHE'S
GONNA DIE.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.605
COPY THAT.

26:03.649 --> 26:07.000
-OHH. HEY. DON'T GET UP.
-HEH HEH.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.523
UNH!

26:08.567 --> 26:10.220
UNH!

26:10.264 --> 26:13.528
YOU ALWAYS HATED
BEING HELPLESS.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.705
EVERYONE HATES
BEING HELPLESS.

26:16.749 --> 26:19.490
NOT LIKE YOU.

26:19.534 --> 26:22.015
OUR TIME ON THE RING,

26:22.058 --> 26:25.105
YOU HATED IT.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.716
ME...

26:27.760 --> 26:31.241
EVEN THOUGH WE WERE
TRAPPED IN A TIN CAN

26:31.285 --> 26:37.247
WITH NOTHING TO DO
AND NO WAY BACK TO EARTH,

26:37.291 --> 26:41.469
THOSE WERE STILL SOME
OF THE BEST TIMES
OF MY LIFE.

26:41.512 --> 26:44.646
WE WERE TOGETHER
AND SAFE.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.825
I LOVE YOU, YOU KNOW?

26:52.480 --> 26:54.787
EMORI, YOU ARE GETTING
THROUGH THIS.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.006
WE'RE ALMOST
TO THE STONE.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.709
WHEN YOU GET TO IT,

27:03.752 --> 27:06.233
I WANT YOU TO
GO TO BARDO.

27:06.276 --> 27:09.149
-WHAT?
-FORGET TAKING ME TO SANCTUM.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.455
IF I'M RIGHT,
THEN BY NOW

27:11.499 --> 27:13.370
MADI ALREADY TURNED
HERSELF IN.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.155
CADOGAN COULD ALREADY
HAVE THE CODE

27:15.198 --> 27:17.070
TO START THE LAST WAR.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.376
WE CAN'T LET HIM DOOM
ALL OF HUMANITY.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.248
STOPPING HIM IS
MORE IMPORTANT.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.989
SCREW THAT.

27:23.032 --> 27:25.121
JORDAN CLAIMS IT'S A TEST,
NOT A WAR,

27:25.165 --> 27:27.646
AND FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THAT'S CRAP, TOO.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.431
I'M NOT LETTING YOU DIE.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.042
WE ALREADY LOST
BELLAMY.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.960
IT'S TOO MUCH, RAVEN.

27:38.004 --> 27:42.269
IF IT'S A CHOICE
BETWEEN SAVING ME

27:42.312 --> 27:44.184
AND SAVING EVERYONE,

27:44.227 --> 27:47.709
YOU CHOOSE EVERYONE.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.669
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.975
PLEASE.

27:53.019 --> 27:56.152
JOHN--HE WON'T BE
ABLE TO,

27:56.196 --> 28:00.243
BUT YOU,
YOU'RE STRONG.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.463
YOU CAN MAKE
THE HARD CHOICE

28:02.506 --> 28:04.944
LIKE CLARKE.

28:04.987 --> 28:07.642
LIKE YOU DID
IN THE REACTOR.

28:07.686 --> 28:11.037
-YOU CAN.
-EMORI, NO, I--

28:11.080 --> 28:13.822
EMORI, I MADE
THE WRONG CALL.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.694
I TREATED HATCH
LIKE A PAWN.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.652
I--I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN
HIM A CHOICE.

28:17.696 --> 28:23.223
I...I WOULDN'T
DO IT AGAIN,

28:23.266 --> 28:26.792
AND I WON'T DO IT NOW.

28:26.835 --> 28:31.840
I AM DONE WATCHING
THE PEOPLE I LOVE DIE.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.189
YOU...

28:33.233 --> 28:34.713
MURPHY: COME ON! UNH!

28:36.366 --> 28:39.108
Y-YOU'RE BEING
STUBBORN, AREN'T YOU?

28:39.152 --> 28:42.285
HEH. YEAH.
IT'S KIND OF MY THING.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.160
I AM SAVING YOU...

28:49.336 --> 28:51.555
AND THEN I'M GONNA SAVE
EVERYONE ELSE.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.645
THAT'S KIND OF
MY THING, TOO.

28:54.689 --> 28:55.995
MURPHY: AGH!

29:02.871 --> 29:04.220
COME ON.

29:06.483 --> 29:11.010
YES! IT'S THE STONE,
EMORI! WE'RE--

29:11.053 --> 29:15.188
EMORI? EMORI!

29:15.231 --> 29:16.929
SHE'S--SHE'S NOT
BREATHING!

29:27.461 --> 29:29.158
I CAN KEEP HER BLOOD
CIRCULATING,

29:29.202 --> 29:31.378
BUT WE NEED TO GET
BACK TO SANCTUM!

29:32.945 --> 29:35.948
WORK FASTER.
COME ON! UNH!

29:37.123 --> 29:38.689
AGH!

29:38.733 --> 29:41.257
UGH! UNH!

29:57.273 --> 29:58.709
GUARD ONE: HE'S BEEN
SINGING THAT

29:58.753 --> 30:00.581
SINCE WE LOCKED HIM UP.

30:00.624 --> 30:03.366
GUARD TWO: FORTUNATELY,
HE'LL HAVE TO SHUT UP TO EAT.

30:03.410 --> 30:06.152
GUARD ONE: STAND ASIDE,
DISCIPLE.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.634
DAMN THING'S
BROKEN AGAIN.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.289
SINCE WHEN ARE LEVEL 11s
ON MAINTENANCE CREW?

30:13.333 --> 30:14.377
LEVITT: SINCE TODAY.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.749
CLARKE: SHUT UP!

30:40.403 --> 30:42.405
WE DID ALL THAT
JUST TO END UP
BACK HERE,

30:42.449 --> 30:44.799
LOCKED UP IN A CELL
NEXT TO SHEIDHEDA.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.890
HEY. WE'LL GET MADI BACK.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.765
THINK ABOUT IT.
SOMEONE BROUGHT US HERE.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.724
THAT MEANS WE HAVE HELP
ON THE INSIDE.

30:56.767 --> 31:00.032
IT'S JUST...

31:00.075 --> 31:03.209
A MATTER OF TIME.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.559
THANK YOU.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.778
FOR OFFERING TO COME.

31:07.822 --> 31:10.738
I TOLD YOU I GET IT NOW,
WHAT SHE MEANS TO YOU.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.392
IT'S WHAT HOPE MEANS TO ME.

31:12.435 --> 31:15.047
IT'S WHAT I MEANT
TO BELLAMY.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.833
YOU WERE EVERYTHING
TO HIM.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.922
THAT'S HOW I'LL
REMEMBER HIM.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.849
SORRY IT TOOK ME
SO LONG.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.199
CLARKE: HATE TO INTERRUPT,
BUT WE NEED TO GET TO MADI.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.332
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

31:39.375 --> 31:40.899
I DON'T KNOW.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.378
ISN'T THIS YOUR GUYS'
SPECIALTY?

31:42.422 --> 31:43.945
HOW WOULD YOU DO IT?

31:43.989 --> 31:46.252
USE THE SUITS,
GO INVISIBLE.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.993
NO. THAT WON'T WORK.
TOO MANY DISCIPLES

31:48.036 --> 31:49.690
WITH HELMETS AROUND.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.387
THEN WE COME IN HOT,
AND WE TAKE THEM ALL OUT.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.868
OR...

31:53.912 --> 31:56.044
WE CREATE A DISTRACTION.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.485
WELL, SINCE
NO ONE'S SHOOTING,

32:02.529 --> 32:04.444
I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS
YOU NEED ME.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.056
WHAT WOULD MADI THINK?

32:08.100 --> 32:09.840
OCTAVIA: THAT'S ENOUGH,
BOTH OF YOU.

32:09.884 --> 32:11.146
WE NEED TO STOP CADOGAN.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.366
I TRIED,
AND FOR MY TROUBLES,

32:13.409 --> 32:15.629
THEY LOCKED ME UP HERE.

32:15.672 --> 32:17.413
HERE'S THE DEAL.

32:17.457 --> 32:20.112
I'D LOVE TO KILL YOU,
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.157
WE NEED YOU.

32:22.201 --> 32:26.988
WE SET YOU LOOSE,
AND YOU DRAW THE DISCIPLES
AWAY FROM M-CAP.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.948
I'M NOT SOME
PETTY DISTRACTION.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.427
I'M THE HIGH KING
OF SANCTUM.

32:31.471 --> 32:34.996
OCTAVIA: OK, YOUR HIGHNESS.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.999
THEN WE WALK OUT OF HERE
AND LOCK THE DOOR BEHIND US.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.436
HMM.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.221
DISTRACTION IT IS.

32:48.488 --> 32:51.360
SHEIDHEDA: ATTENTION, SHEEP.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.275
I'M HERE TO KILL
YOUR SHEPHERD.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.364
GUARD: PRISONER BREACH.
SEND REINFORCEMENTS TO LEVEL 4!

32:55.408 --> 32:58.411
GO! WE HAVE TWO
DISCIPLES IN PURSUIT.

32:58.454 --> 33:01.283
UNH! AGH!

33:01.327 --> 33:02.676
AAH!

33:02.719 --> 33:04.112
OHH! AAH!

33:08.508 --> 33:10.031
HE'S OFFLINE.
ATTACK!

33:10.075 --> 33:11.685
AAH!

33:19.867 --> 33:22.478
DETAIN ON LEVEL 4.

33:22.522 --> 33:25.699
SHEIDHEDA: IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?!

33:25.742 --> 33:28.223
RAAAAH!

33:35.709 --> 33:37.493
RAVEN: THERE'S ONE SYMBOL
STILL COVERED.

33:43.978 --> 33:46.067
THAT'S IT! I CAN SEE
THE LAST SYMBOL NOW!

33:49.331 --> 33:50.898
GET BACK!

34:05.391 --> 34:06.957
JACKSON!

34:10.526 --> 34:12.528
WE GOT TO GO NOW!

34:14.443 --> 34:16.184
THANK YOU.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.925
WE'RE NOT LOSING
ANYONE ELSE.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.927
WE'LL COME BACK FOR MILLER.
LET'S GO.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.032
OCTAVIA: HE'S NOT HERE?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.860
CLARKE: WE KNEW THAT
WAS A POSSIBILITY.

34:39.903 --> 34:41.644
WE'LL DEAL
WITH SHEIDHEDA LATER.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.474
I GREW UP
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

34:45.518 --> 34:48.738
OCTAVIA: THAT'S WAR,
LEVITT.

34:48.782 --> 34:51.872
IT LOOKS EXCITING
IN HOLOGRAM MODE,

34:51.915 --> 34:53.830
BUT THIS IS THE REALITY.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.658
CLARKE: COME ON.
RIGHT NOW, ALL THAT MATTERS

34:55.702 --> 34:57.182
IS GETTING TO MADI.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.538
LOOKS LIKE
OUR DIVERSION WORKED.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.496
LEVITT, YOU GO
IN FIRST.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.455
THEY WON'T SEE YOU
AS A THREAT.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.688
CLARKE: MADI.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.125
HEY.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.608
MADI? MADI?

35:32.652 --> 35:35.655
MADI, I'M HERE. MADI?

35:37.309 --> 35:38.788
MA...

35:43.576 --> 35:45.317
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

35:45.360 --> 35:49.103
SHE'S BREATHING.
WHY ISN'T SHE RESPONDING?

35:49.147 --> 35:52.062
I'M HERE.

35:53.716 --> 35:56.241
LEVITT: I'M ACCESSING
THE HISTORY NOW.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.464
IT'S OK.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.515
MADI! MADI,
LOOK AT ME.

36:09.558 --> 36:12.518
HEY. HI.

36:12.561 --> 36:15.651
SAY--SAY SOMETHING.

36:15.695 --> 36:19.089
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.266
SAY SOMETHING!

36:37.412 --> 36:40.546
OH, MY BABY.

36:40.589 --> 36:43.853
MY BABY. MY BABY.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.908
WELL, HOW IS SHE?

36:54.951 --> 36:56.910
THERE'S STILL NEURAL ACTIVITY,

36:56.953 --> 36:59.478
BUT HER BRAIN STEM
SHOWS EVIDENCE
OF A MASSIVE STROKE.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.958
WELL, NEURAL ACTIVITY
IS GOOD, RIGHT?

37:02.002 --> 37:04.918
SHE'S CONSCIOUS,
BUT SHE CAN'T MOVE...

37:04.961 --> 37:07.660
ANYTHING.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.705
SHE'S LOCKED IN.

37:20.629 --> 37:23.241
CLARKE, SHE CAN HEAR YOU.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.723
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE HERE.

37:36.732 --> 37:39.996
HEY, BABY.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.912
I'M HERE.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.566
I'M RIGHT HERE.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.006
IS IT RECOVERABLE?

37:50.050 --> 37:52.095
WHAT? I--

37:54.750 --> 37:58.711
NO. THE AREAS
OF HER BRAIN RESPONSIBLE

37:58.754 --> 38:01.627
FOR VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.455
I'M SORRY.

38:03.498 --> 38:06.109
NO. NO.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.867
CLARKE...NO.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.228
I'LL DO IT.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.583
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
LIVE WITH THIS.

38:58.858 --> 39:02.905
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.952
DON'T BE SCARED.

39:08.258 --> 39:10.173
JUST LISTEN
TO MY VOICE, OK?

39:46.949 --> 39:49.125
LEVITT: NO.
HE GOT THE CODE.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.216
OH, GOD.

39:54.870 --> 39:57.438
OH, I'M SORRY.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.353
OH, GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.443
THE TEST CODE?
ARE YOU SURE?

40:04.576 --> 40:06.273
HOLOGRAM MODE.

40:19.242 --> 40:23.725
HE GOT WHAT HE NEEDED
AND LEFT HER HERE?

40:23.769 --> 40:26.075
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.513
IF ONE MAN REPRESENTS
THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE...

40:28.556 --> 40:30.253
IT CAN'T BE HIM.

40:30.297 --> 40:33.039
WE CAN STILL STOP HIM,
BUT WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.922
ARE YOU SURE?

40:46.966 --> 40:49.664
YOU'VE WANTED THIS
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.625
BEFORE YOU,
I DIDN'T HAVE A LIFE.

40:57.193 --> 40:58.891
CLARKE: I'LL COME BACK.

41:01.241 --> 41:04.810
I'LL BE BACK
AFTER I STOP THE TEST,

41:04.853 --> 41:08.814
AND I PROMISE I WILL NOT
LET HIM WIN.
