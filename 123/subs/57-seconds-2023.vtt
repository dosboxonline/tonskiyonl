I don't know if it's,
it might be too much.

34:45.321 --> 34:46.442
Franklin.
I love it.

34:46.538 --> 34:48.137
I hate parking it
out here, you know.

34:48.233 --> 34:50.538
Franklin, put this in
a parking lot immediately.

34:50.634 --> 34:51.722
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:51.817 --> 34:52.682
Do you see where we are?

34:52.777 --> 34:53.610
I know.
Yeah.

34:53.705 --> 34:56.234
[phone buzzing]

34:57.386 --> 34:58.378
Hello?

34:58.474 --> 34:59.882
[Anton] <i>Is now a good time?</i>

34:59.978 --> 35:01.226
Excuse me?

35:01.322 --> 35:02.794
[Anton] <i>The interview</i>
<i>you wanted.</i>

35:03.432 --> 35:04.586
Burrell interview.

35:05.225 --> 35:07.529
Uh, like right now, right now?

35:07.626 --> 35:09.482
[Anton] <i>Uh,</i>
<i>if you're available?</i>

35:10.121 --> 35:11.721
Yeah, yeah, I'm,
I'm available.

35:11.818 --> 35:12.937
[Anton] <i>Good.</i>

35:13.674 --> 35:15.209
<i>I've provided transportation.</i>

35:15.306 --> 35:16.298
Transportation?

35:18.218 --> 35:20.490
[mysterious music]

35:20.585 --> 35:22.186
[Anton] <i>See you soon, Mr. Fox.</i>

35:24.106 --> 35:24.970
Thank you.

35:28.457 --> 35:29.706
Here, have fun.

35:29.802 --> 35:31.050
I'll see you later.

35:31.145 --> 35:32.682
[Jala] All right,
well, good luck.

35:34.152 --> 35:35.498
[door opens]

35:37.386 --> 35:38.378
[door shuts]

35:41.514 --> 35:44.938
[ethereal music]

35:45.034 --> 35:46.218
[Anton] Mr. Fox.

35:48.874 --> 35:49.738
My hero.

35:50.890 --> 35:52.074
Welcome.

35:52.170 --> 35:53.961
Ingram will show you
to the boardroom.

36:00.266 --> 36:02.570
[electronic chirping]

36:03.722 --> 36:07.178
Oh, Mr. Burrell, thank you
so much for taking the time.

36:07.274 --> 36:10.665
No, sir, thank you for
your quick thinking.

36:10.762 --> 36:14.058
Oh, I, uh, just,
just reacted, sir.

36:14.154 --> 36:15.497
I'm not, not a fighter.

36:16.234 --> 36:17.385
I have a gift.

36:17.930 --> 36:18.794
Oh.

36:20.778 --> 36:23.786
You might wanna come closer.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.194
Right.

36:35.754 --> 36:38.954
[contemplative music]

36:41.706 --> 36:42.921
Thank you, Ingram.

36:44.554 --> 36:47.530
Here, for you.

36:49.194 --> 36:50.921
[electronic chirping]
Are these the new Fives?

36:51.017 --> 36:54.122
No, but they're
the best you can get.

36:54.218 --> 36:57.034
Unless you're me.
For you and your lady friend.

36:58.218 --> 36:59.370
I do my homework.

36:59.465 --> 37:01.930
I know that you were
a graduate of MIT.

37:02.026 --> 37:04.490
I know that you started
your own biotech company

37:04.586 --> 37:07.690
with your sister,
whom you lost to...

37:08.554 --> 37:10.985
well, let's say
unfortunate circumstances.

37:13.802 --> 37:14.857
Questions?

37:15.530 --> 37:16.905
Sorry?
[Anton] Your interview.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.122
Oh.
Questions.

37:18.218 --> 37:20.969
Unless you read minds.
No, no, I do not.

37:21.066 --> 37:25.130
Uh... I was thinking we could,
we could start big. Um...

37:26.121 --> 37:27.946
So do, do you
believe that one day

37:28.041 --> 37:30.378
your Tri-Band technology
will be

37:30.474 --> 37:33.034
a viable alternative
to medication,

37:33.129 --> 37:35.146
pills, syrups, inhalers?

37:38.857 --> 37:40.458
Alternative would be nice.

37:41.832 --> 37:44.202
Complete replacement
would be best.

37:44.906 --> 37:50.121
A technology that makes
medication an unnecessary...

37:52.778 --> 37:54.410
barbaric relic.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.946
But not all medical needs

37:56.042 --> 37:58.409
stem from poor
healthcare habits.

37:58.506 --> 38:01.802
What about accidents?
Car crash, ski injury, falls.

38:01.897 --> 38:04.841
What besides medication
can manage pain?

38:04.938 --> 38:06.890
You're asking
the wrong questions.

38:08.074 --> 38:12.842
It's not what do we need
to manage pain from accidents.

38:13.802 --> 38:16.458
It's why have accidents
in the first place?

38:18.442 --> 38:19.978
Let's step outside a minute,

38:20.074 --> 38:21.610
I'm feeling a little
claustrophobic.

38:21.706 --> 38:22.634
OK? Come on.

38:27.434 --> 38:28.682
In the future,

38:28.777 --> 38:31.338
your Tri-Bands are gonna
eliminate accidents?

38:31.434 --> 38:32.810
Not Tri-Bands.

38:32.906 --> 38:35.241
What I'm working on
will make Tri-Bands

38:35.338 --> 38:37.898
as antiquated
as a rotary telephone.

38:39.978 --> 38:41.770
The platform has limitations.

38:42.666 --> 38:44.137
It's reactive.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.538
In order to eliminate accidents,

38:46.634 --> 38:48.874
we're gonna need
a proactive solution.

38:48.969 --> 38:51.178
And you have one?

38:52.938 --> 38:54.089
Off the record?

38:54.858 --> 38:56.458
[Franklin] Sure.

38:56.554 --> 38:58.569
Years ago,
I stumbled on a substance

38:58.666 --> 39:01.226
that contained
quantum particles.

39:01.322 --> 39:03.146
Like quantum crystals.
Mm-hmm.

39:03.850 --> 39:05.386
I thought those were
just recently discovered.

39:05.482 --> 39:07.562
Oh, well, that's
what the world thinks.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.386
I discovered them decades ago

39:09.482 --> 39:13.993
while working on laser
technology, but early sixties,

39:14.090 --> 39:15.946
man of my complexion...

39:16.042 --> 39:18.378
How long would it be before
the technology gets stolen

39:18.474 --> 39:19.786
or I wound up dead?

39:19.882 --> 39:24.394
So I just kept it secret
and kept experimenting.

39:24.970 --> 39:27.466
But I do believe
that integrating AI

39:27.562 --> 39:30.282
with this substance
will eliminate accidents.

39:31.273 --> 39:32.554
No accidents,

39:32.650 --> 39:35.113
no injuries,
no injuries, no pain.

39:35.210 --> 39:38.218
No pain,
no need for medication.

39:38.634 --> 39:40.106
That, that sounds incredible.

39:40.202 --> 39:43.018
Well, forgive me
for sounding immodest,

39:43.690 --> 39:47.370
but if I'm truthful,
incredible is what I do.

39:47.465 --> 39:49.418
[chuckling]

39:49.513 --> 39:52.393
But you weren't being honest
with me completely before.

39:55.018 --> 39:55.914
About?

39:56.010 --> 39:57.770
About being a fighter.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.410
Look, I sense that
you're a modest man.

40:03.082 --> 40:05.833
Power and material things
don't hold much pull.

40:06.698 --> 40:09.673
But I also detect
a desire for justice,

40:09.770 --> 40:12.010
desire to make
the world a better place.

40:13.482 --> 40:16.842
Don't let
the intellectual fear in here

40:16.938 --> 40:20.138
keep you from pursuing
what's burning in here.

40:22.922 --> 40:24.010
Jay, do you,

40:24.650 --> 40:28.298
do you think that I should take
that meeting with Thorenson?

40:31.274 --> 40:32.713
What, you go see an angel

40:32.810 --> 40:34.666
and then you gonna go
meet with the devil?

40:34.762 --> 40:38.506
I mean, didn't you say
that he killed your sister?

40:39.210 --> 40:41.322
Yeah, but it's just,
just a meeting.

40:41.418 --> 40:43.914
You know, maybe I can,
I don't know,

40:44.010 --> 40:47.178
maybe I can get him to slip up
and say something he shouldn't.

40:48.394 --> 40:50.953
Blow it out to the world,
I don't know.

40:51.050 --> 40:52.873
Could be a little
bit of justice.

40:53.610 --> 40:56.394
[both mumbling]

40:56.490 --> 40:57.546
OK.

40:58.538 --> 40:59.818
[Franklin] <i>Despite the effort,</i>

40:59.914 --> 41:01.642
<i>I couldn't get Burrell's</i>
<i>words out of my head.</i>

41:01.738 --> 41:03.114
<i>I did have a desire</i>
<i>for justice,</i>

41:03.210 --> 41:04.874
<i>a fire burning inside of me.</i>

41:04.970 --> 41:07.146
<i>This was an opportunity to</i>
<i>confront the man responsible</i>

41:07.242 --> 41:08.746
<i>for my sister's death.</i>

41:08.841 --> 41:10.282
<i>And I wanted to take that fire</i>

41:10.378 --> 41:13.258
<i>and use it to light</i>
<i>Sig Thorenson the fuck up.</i>

41:13.354 --> 41:15.658
<i>All I had to do was</i>
<i>push past my fear.</i>

41:15.755 --> 41:17.770
<i>All I had to do</i>
<i>was take action.</i>

41:18.793 --> 41:20.170
[Calvert laughing]

41:20.266 --> 41:21.258
Change of heart.

41:22.281 --> 41:23.466
Good man.

41:26.858 --> 41:27.786
Follow me.

41:27.882 --> 41:28.810
[Franklin] All right.

41:30.826 --> 41:34.409
[Calvert] Mr. Thorenson,
meet Franklin Fox.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.106
Franklin Fox.

41:40.202 --> 41:41.098
Sig Thorenson.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.586
That beautiful woman
there is Renee Renzler.

41:44.682 --> 41:46.666
Brilliant mind, keeps
my business afloat,

41:46.762 --> 41:48.074
which is why
I don't have a problem

41:48.170 --> 41:50.346
that she won't give me
the time of day outside of work.

41:50.442 --> 41:52.138
Isn't that right, Calvert?

41:52.714 --> 41:57.738
But as you can see,
I do all right.

41:58.314 --> 42:00.906
Mmm. Give me a minute,
sweetheart, OK?

42:01.002 --> 42:03.146
Oh, ignore the
naysayers, Franklin,

42:03.242 --> 42:07.082
'cause money can buy you
happiness, and a lot of it.

42:07.178 --> 42:08.874
You want, you wanna
meet her girlfriends?

42:08.969 --> 42:11.593
Oh no, I'm good. I don't mix
business and pleasure.

42:11.690 --> 42:13.994
Oh, dull, but I like it.

42:14.090 --> 42:15.530
No, Renson Pharmaceuticals

42:15.626 --> 42:17.290
could use a persuasive
voice like yours

42:17.386 --> 42:19.370
to help us regain
some goodwill.

42:19.466 --> 42:20.874
'Cause fact is,
Zonastin has helped a,

42:20.971 --> 42:23.338
a lot of people
dealing with pain.

42:23.434 --> 42:25.835
Like it helped my sister?
Hmm?

42:25.930 --> 42:27.434
Took away her pain.
Oh?

42:27.530 --> 42:30.378
Took it away permanently
'cause it killed her.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.186
You knew about the dangers
of that drug and you put it out.

42:34.281 --> 42:37.930
So my truth is her death
is on your fucking hands.

42:38.954 --> 42:40.842
[chuckling]

42:40.938 --> 42:42.218
Well, this is awkward.

42:43.466 --> 42:46.026
Anything else before you
become a broken memory?

42:46.506 --> 42:47.562
Yeah.

42:47.946 --> 42:50.026
This.
[Sig grunting]

42:51.114 --> 42:52.651
Renson Pharmaceuticals
could use a--

42:52.746 --> 42:55.818
A persuasive of voice like mine
to help this company regain

42:55.914 --> 42:57.770
some goodwill,
get your story out there.

42:57.866 --> 42:59.658
I mean, the truth is,
Zonastin, it's,

42:59.754 --> 43:02.442
it's helped so many people
with so much pain.

43:02.538 --> 43:03.689
[Sig stammering]

43:03.786 --> 43:05.738
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

43:05.834 --> 43:06.826
[Franklin] Oh.

43:06.921 --> 43:08.426
Calvert says you have a gift.

43:08.522 --> 43:12.970
Right, you have a, a lucky
streak like nobody's business.

43:13.066 --> 43:15.850
Not so much luck as it is,
um, it's more of a skill.

43:16.266 --> 43:17.579
You know, I can,
I can see things,

43:17.675 --> 43:19.370
but my, my abilities
are rather limited.

43:19.467 --> 43:21.642
I can only see things that
are just about to happen.

43:21.738 --> 43:25.802
So you can see
what I'm thinking.

43:26.378 --> 43:27.594
Yeah.

43:27.689 --> 43:29.546
You're thinking that
I'm full of shit.

43:29.642 --> 43:31.881
[laughing]

43:31.979 --> 43:33.354
I like that. I like that.

43:33.449 --> 43:35.018
I'll tell you what,
let's make a wager. Hmm?

43:35.113 --> 43:37.450
You prove Calvert right

43:37.546 --> 43:40.362
and I'll pay you, I don't know,
what do you get for an article?

43:40.458 --> 43:41.450
About a thousand.

43:41.547 --> 43:42.698
All right,
you prove Calvert right

43:42.793 --> 43:43.914
and for every article you write

43:44.009 --> 43:45.321
that tells the world
Sig Thorenson

43:45.419 --> 43:47.626
knew nothing about the
addictive effects of Zonastin

43:47.722 --> 43:50.026
and elevates the Renson
Pharmaceutical name,

43:50.121 --> 43:53.353
I will multiply that by 100.

43:53.995 --> 43:55.273
100,000?

43:55.370 --> 43:56.778
A small price
for good publicity.

43:56.875 --> 44:01.066
Fail and I fire Calvert
for telling a ridiculous lie

44:01.162 --> 44:03.338
or being too stupid
to see through your scam.

44:03.434 --> 44:06.250
And you owe me five articles
at half your going rate.

44:07.306 --> 44:08.234
What do you say?

44:09.130 --> 44:10.379
I say you name the game.

44:10.475 --> 44:12.458
Ah, no, no, no, no game, no.

44:12.553 --> 44:15.338
You simply tell me
what will happen...

44:17.099 --> 44:18.313
after I whistle.

44:18.410 --> 44:21.770
You're gonna whistle?
And you predict the outcome.

44:22.250 --> 44:24.554
Come on, 100K if you
can do it right now.

44:24.650 --> 44:25.962
Let's have some fun.

44:26.474 --> 44:27.627
Sure. Uh...

44:27.723 --> 44:29.706
OK, uh, you're gonna whistle

44:29.802 --> 44:31.114
and then your dog's

44:31.210 --> 44:33.291
gonna come running from
outside and jump in your lap.

44:33.387 --> 44:34.730
Ah.

44:37.195 --> 44:38.570
[Sig whistles]

44:41.131 --> 44:43.146
[woman grunting]

44:48.426 --> 44:50.154
Mmm.

44:50.826 --> 44:53.258
Calvert, you're fired,

44:53.738 --> 44:55.978
and Franklin,
you owe me five articles.

44:57.578 --> 44:59.466
No, no, no, no game, no.

44:59.562 --> 45:02.026
You simply tell me
what will happen...

45:04.203 --> 45:05.258
after I whistle.

45:05.353 --> 45:06.474
So you're gonna whistle.

45:06.569 --> 45:09.226
And you predict the outcome.

45:10.762 --> 45:12.170
Yep.

45:12.266 --> 45:14.986
So the woman that was just here
behind you is gonna return.

45:15.082 --> 45:16.587
She's gonna trip along her way.

45:16.683 --> 45:17.994
Come around, kiss your neck

45:18.089 --> 45:19.658
and put her hands
on your shoulders.

45:19.753 --> 45:21.162
Maybe you get a massage.

45:22.154 --> 45:23.242
[scoffs]

Sig, are you sure about this?

46:01.002 --> 46:01.993
Him working here?

46:02.090 --> 46:03.531
Put him in the corporate office.

46:03.627 --> 46:06.507
No. Friends close,
enemies closer.

46:07.178 --> 46:10.475

it's true.

article to make him look good?

Yeah, 100K a pop.

that's like selling out

who read your blog

46:25.707 --> 46:27.018
and your sister.

46:27.114 --> 46:28.715
You're just gonna
let him buy you?

46:28.810 --> 46:30.315
Jala, come on, it's
not about the money.

46:30.954 --> 46:32.427
You don't think I
wanted to kill him

46:32.523 --> 46:33.994
when I was standing
in front of him?

46:34.090 --> 46:36.075
But if I go and work for him,
you realize I can get like,

46:36.171 --> 46:37.963
deep in underground
and get some actual proof

46:38.059 --> 46:39.433
that he knew about
Zonastin the entire time

46:39.530 --> 46:40.778
and mess up his entire world.

46:40.875 --> 46:44.394

reviews about the man. Mm...

46:44.907 --> 46:45.771
Yeah.

46:46.859 --> 46:47.722
No, I know.

46:49.515 --> 46:51.403
I'll find a way around that.

46:51.499 --> 46:52.395
In the meantime,

46:53.290 --> 46:54.347
I'll take his money

46:54.922 --> 46:57.610
and I'll use it for something
worthwhile, like us.

46:57.706 --> 46:59.147
Us?
Yeah. Us.

46:59.242 --> 47:01.546

shithole, get an insane house.

48:05.962 --> 48:07.307
[Sig] So what are you thinking?

48:07.978 --> 48:09.578
[Franklin] Well,
I was thinking instead

48:09.673 --> 48:10.954
of doing a bunch
of little articles,

48:11.051 --> 48:13.963
why don't we do one
big event-style piece

48:14.059 --> 48:16.618
where we completely rebrand
Renson Pharmaceuticals

48:16.714 --> 48:17.546
and yourself?

48:17.642 --> 48:19.210
What, like that
circus Burrell does?

48:19.915 --> 48:21.771
Well, I was thinking
something more in line of

48:21.867 --> 48:23.082
Renson Pharmaceuticals'
connection

48:23.178 --> 48:24.298

48:25.547 --> 48:27.274
[Sig stammers]
Yeah.

48:27.371 --> 48:29.419
Time and cost.
It's not a fast process.

48:29.515 --> 48:34.059
I would say... six months
to get it done right. Um...

48:34.155 --> 48:36.746
You need a lot of time to
really dig into the company and,

48:36.842 --> 48:38.602
you know, products and the
pipeline, that sort of thing.

48:38.698 --> 48:40.490
As far as cost, I can create
a budget for you.

48:40.586 --> 48:42.091
There's a shareholders'
meeting in August.

48:42.186 --> 48:43.434

48:43.529 --> 48:45.482

meeting in August.

48:45.579 --> 48:47.627

pay you per article,

rethink our collateral.

50:10.219 --> 50:11.850
[Sig] We gotta figure out
how he does that trick.

50:11.947 --> 50:13.355
And it better not
have anything to do

50:13.450 --> 50:15.851
with that ridiculous Tri-Band.

50:15.947 --> 50:18.059
Maybe we need to see
if he can do the trick

50:18.155 --> 50:19.466

50:19.563 --> 50:21.450

when I first saw him.

that, let's do that.

him up a little bit

has a girlfriend?

01:03:49.707 --> 01:03:51.499
Oh, he left a few hours ago.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.483
But he told me to give you this

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:55.499
when you were good
enough to drive.

01:03:58.475 --> 01:03:59.884
Come on, what?

01:03:59.978 --> 01:04:01.612
You didn't have a good time?

01:04:01.708 --> 01:04:02.827
Some gorgeous girls in there.

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:04.235
You spiked my fucking drink.

01:04:04.332 --> 01:04:06.476
That was a part
of the good time.

01:04:06.572 --> 01:04:08.363
[engine rumbling]

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.252
[tires squealing]

01:04:11.404 --> 01:04:14.347
[engine roaring]

01:04:15.467 --> 01:04:18.411
That fool's gonna kill
himself in that thing.

01:04:21.996 --> 01:04:24.107
Hey, hey.

01:04:24.203 --> 01:04:25.388
Sorry, sorry I'm so late.

01:04:25.484 --> 01:04:27.404
I, I got held up in
a meeting with Thorenson.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.396
[Anton] Franklin?

01:04:29.452 --> 01:04:30.443
Mr. Burrell.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.196
What? What's, what's going on?

01:04:33.292 --> 01:04:34.988
Oh, you mean what went on?

01:04:36.107 --> 01:04:38.860
Exhibition of paintings
by this talented young lady

01:04:38.956 --> 01:04:40.491
you're engaged to.

01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:43.147
Yeah, he just
stopped by the gallery.

01:04:43.243 --> 01:04:45.098
I find her paintings
so intriguing

01:04:45.194 --> 01:04:46.667
that I had to see some more

01:04:46.763 --> 01:04:49.034
before I decided
which one to buy.

01:04:49.516 --> 01:04:50.476
Couldn't decide.

01:04:50.891 --> 01:04:52.300
He brought them all.

01:04:52.971 --> 01:04:56.618
I just might have made
her independently wealthy.

01:04:57.739 --> 01:05:01.387
And you, woo,
so full of surprises.

01:05:01.483 --> 01:05:03.788
Predictive analysis
be damned, huh?

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:10.154
Saving Thorenson? Didn't see
that one on the horizon.

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:13.994
[ominous music]
[door closes]

01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:19.658
Did, did he just say...

01:05:19.754 --> 01:05:21.707
You took a meeting
with Thorenson?

01:05:22.412 --> 01:05:23.467
Yeah.

01:05:24.779 --> 01:05:25.868
You think these things
are spying--

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:27.244
Franklin, forget
the, the Tri-Band.

01:05:27.338 --> 01:05:28.876
You had a meeting
with Thorenson,

01:05:28.972 --> 01:05:30.251
that's why you bailed on me.

01:05:30.347 --> 01:05:32.556
No, no, I didn't bail on you.
I have a job.

01:05:32.652 --> 01:05:33.740
Oh, it's your job now.

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:37.867
I thought your job was to get
enough dirt on the asshole

01:05:37.963 --> 01:05:40.107
so that you could put
him out of business.

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:41.387
Yeah, it is.

01:05:42.156 --> 01:05:45.036
Is that why you smell like
cheap whores and stale beer?

01:05:45.739 --> 01:05:46.827
Or is it the other way around?

01:05:46.924 --> 01:05:48.554
I am so close to
nailing him, all right?

01:05:48.651 --> 01:05:49.643
Why did you save him?

01:05:49.739 --> 01:05:51.434
If you wanted
to get rid of him--

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.780
I saved him to save you, OK?

01:05:52.876 --> 01:05:54.604
Who knows how many people
that guy would've shot.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.787
Apparently you.

01:05:58.732 --> 01:06:00.011
I'm building a case.

01:06:00.107 --> 01:06:02.251
OK? Listen to me,
in four months,

01:06:02.348 --> 01:06:04.427
this all explodes at his
annual investor's meeting.

01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:05.420
Four months?

01:06:06.124 --> 01:06:08.492
Franklin, this is not about
your sister or the world.

01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:11.787
This is about you and
power and all this shit.

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:14.411
I think you like
taking his money.

01:06:14.507 --> 01:06:16.394
His money paid
for your art show.

01:06:16.491 --> 01:06:18.732
I knew you would hold
that over my head.

01:06:18.827 --> 01:06:20.491
You say you don't care about
the money, but you do, Jala.

01:06:20.588 --> 01:06:22.123
Leave me alone.
That makes you a hypocrite.

01:06:22.219 --> 01:06:23.723
I'm a hypocrite?
Yeah, it makes you a hypocrite.

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:24.748
I'm a hypocrite?
Yes.

01:06:24.844 --> 01:06:25.772
[Franklin grunting]

01:06:25.867 --> 01:06:29.100

01:06:41.932 --> 01:06:43.596
What? What?

01:06:43.692 --> 01:06:44.972
What was that?

01:06:45.707 --> 01:06:47.211
You were touching me.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:47.307 --> 01:06:49.163
'Cause we, we were,
we were out there in the water.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.858
It's OK. It's OK, all right.
I, I, I, I can--

01:06:50.954 --> 01:06:53.324
Franklin, what was that?
I can explain.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.923
What the fuck?

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.100
How the fuck did I
get in the water?

01:06:57.196 --> 01:06:59.884
I, I, I didn't--
I was in there. I saw it.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.163
It's the ring, OK?

01:07:04.716 --> 01:07:05.611
What is that?

01:07:06.092 --> 01:07:07.787
I, I found it.

01:07:09.004 --> 01:07:10.380
And it does that?

01:07:10.476 --> 01:07:13.580
Yeah, yeah, it takes you
back in time 57 seconds.

01:07:13.676 --> 01:07:14.507
No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:14.603 --> 01:07:16.556
That's not, that's not real.

01:07:16.652 --> 01:07:17.803
You want me to,
I can show you a--

01:07:17.899 --> 01:07:20.683
No, don't do it again.
Don't ever do it again.

01:07:21.578 --> 01:07:23.691
I feel like I'm
going fuckin' crazy. [sniffles]

01:07:26.603 --> 01:07:27.788
Where did you get it?

01:07:28.523 --> 01:07:30.604
I found it on stage the
night that I saved Burrell.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:31.883
But I don't know
where it came from.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.036
I don't know how it works.

01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:34.058
The night we met?

01:07:34.154 --> 01:07:35.596
So you've had it
this whole time?

01:07:36.716 --> 01:07:38.764
How many times
have you done that?

01:07:38.858 --> 01:07:40.460
And why can't I remember?

01:07:41.452 --> 01:07:42.794
I mean, I don't know.

01:07:42.891 --> 01:07:45.388
I guess you only remember
if you're like touching it,

01:07:45.484 --> 01:07:47.052
and if not,
it just, just resets.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:50.411
Do you use it to do
things, to get stuff, like...?

01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:53.580
That's it, isn't it?

01:07:53.676 --> 01:07:55.178
This house, all,
all this, all this shit.

01:07:55.274 --> 01:07:56.460
It's that thing.

01:07:59.244 --> 01:08:00.524
Did you use it with me?

01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:03.914
Is that how you got me?

01:08:04.011 --> 01:08:06.891
Just a redo until you
say what I want to hear?

01:08:06.988 --> 01:08:08.428
This ring gave us
everything, OK?

01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:10.348
Our whole life
is a lie, Franklin.

01:08:10.444 --> 01:08:12.044
It's not a lie, 'cause
when you press it,

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:13.771
it's like it never happened. OK?

01:08:13.868 --> 01:08:16.651
But it did happen.
It happened and you know it.

01:08:16.748 --> 01:08:18.571
It happened,
you know it, I forget it.

01:08:18.668 --> 01:08:21.612
You know what? I should have
gone with my gut from the start.

01:08:21.707 --> 01:08:23.532
You are a liar.

01:08:23.627 --> 01:08:26.156
[pensive music]

01:08:33.578 --> 01:08:34.732

[Calvert] <i>Talk to Renee.</i>

01:08:47.244 --> 01:08:49.898
She knows where all
the bodies are buried.

[pensive music]

01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:54.091
They're blackmailing everyone.

Franklin.

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:37.836
I heard you got a nice
gift from Mr. Thorenson.

01:09:37.931 --> 01:09:39.724
Yeah, I did, it was,
it was pretty nice actually.

01:09:39.818 --> 01:09:41.707
But you know what would
be an even nicer gift?

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:44.140
Hmm.
[Franklin] Code to that safe.

01:09:45.036 --> 01:09:46.316
[Renee scoffs]

01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:48.076
Let me know when
you're serious.

01:09:50.572 --> 01:09:52.140
How about right now?

01:09:52.236 --> 01:09:53.900
Give me the combination.

01:09:53.996 --> 01:09:55.404

[electronic whirring

01:10:21.067 --> 01:10:23.276
Do not scream
or I will kill you again.

01:10:23.371 --> 01:10:26.636
OK now, write down the code
to that goddamn safe.

01:10:26.732 --> 01:10:27.851
Write it down.

01:10:27.948 --> 01:10:29.228
Write it down!

Hey Renee, you wanna
see a magic trick?

01:10:42.508 --> 01:10:43.628
OK.

01:10:43.724 --> 01:10:45.516
I am going to get the
combination to this safe

01:10:45.612 --> 01:10:47.084
using only my mind.

01:10:49.324 --> 01:10:51.884
Franklin, that's not
something to play with.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.516

Huh?

Check this out.

01:11:08.076 --> 01:11:09.740

What?

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:14.732
OK, next time it won't be
your thigh, it'll be your head.

And trust me, it is not pretty.

01:11:16.204 --> 01:11:18.091

the code to the safe?

five, seven, eight.

Five, three,
five, seven, eight.

Five, three, five, seven, eight.

Shut up.

01:11:39.915 --> 01:11:41.164

01:11:49.676 --> 01:11:51.468
I did, it was very nice.

No, no,
I'm almost out the door.

01:11:54.668 --> 01:11:56.172
OK, well, I'm gonna
stick around for a while.

01:11:56.268 --> 01:11:58.188

I wanna finish up.
