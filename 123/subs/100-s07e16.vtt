WEBVTT

00:37.385 --> 00:38.864
ALMOST THERE!

00:38.908 --> 00:40.997
MURPHY: STAY WITH US, EMORI.
STAY WITH US!

00:41.041 --> 00:43.869
OK. SLOW, SLOW.
MURPH.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.697
MURPHY: I GOT IT!

00:45.741 --> 00:47.525
JACKSON: RAVEN, GET
THE DEFIBRILLATOR.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.440
-WHERE?
-THERE!

00:49.484 --> 00:50.659
MURPHY: HEY. COME ON, BABY.
COME ON, BABY.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.357
STAY WITH ME.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.098
JACKSON: GOOD. NOW--
RAVEN: I KNOW HOW.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.578
I'VE USED ONE
ON MYSELF.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.536
MURPHY: JAX,
WHAT CAN I DO?

00:58.580 --> 00:59.972
NOTHING YET.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.585
-OK.
-SET.

01:03.628 --> 01:04.847
CLEAR!

01:10.809 --> 01:12.072
COME ON!

01:12.115 --> 01:13.464
ONE MORE TIME.
COME ON.

01:13.508 --> 01:14.944
RAVEN, CLEAR!

01:26.477 --> 01:28.131
MURPHY: GOOD JOB.
JACKSON: HER PULSE IS WEAK.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.741
SHE'S LOST
TOO MUCH BLOOD.

01:29.785 --> 01:33.005
-SO WE GIVE HER MINE.
-MINE, TOO.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.485
JACKSON: MURPHY'S
A NIGHTBLOOD. YOU'RE NOT.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.705
-WHA--
-JUST GO BACK FOR THE OTHERS.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.663
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE
HER LIKE THIS.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.143
UNLESS YOU'VE DONE
ABDOMINAL SURGERY

01:40.187 --> 01:41.362
ON YOURSELF, TOO,
THERE'S NOTHING MORE

01:41.405 --> 01:43.015
YOU CAN DO.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.756
I'LL GET HER STABLE,
THEN TAKE OUT THE BAR.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.149
RAVEN, HE'S RIGHT.
THEY COULD BE
TRAPPED.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.455
YOU GOT TO GET
THEM OUT.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.326
-ALONE? HOW?
-I DON'T KNOW.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.719
NEVER MIND.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.373
JUST...

01:52.416 --> 01:54.766
JUST SAVE HER.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.682
MURPHY: HEY.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.162
ONCE OUR FRIENDS
ARE SAFE,

01:59.206 --> 02:00.859
YOU HAVE TO GO
AFTER MADI, OK?

02:00.903 --> 02:03.123
YOU HAVE TO STOP
CADOGAN.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.702
MAN: SHEPHERD EN ROUTE
TO BRIDGE.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.051
ALL DISCIPLES, STAY ALERT.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.405
LEVITT: THE SHEPHERD'S
UNIT WILL BE WITH HIM

02:24.448 --> 02:26.102
GUARDING THE DOOR.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.625
TOO BAD FOR THEM.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.240
GRENADES?
SO MORE KILLING,

02:33.283 --> 02:35.155
THAT'S THE ANSWER?

02:36.547 --> 02:38.767
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.073
MAYBE WE DON'T DESERVE
TO TRANSCEND.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.690
AGH!

02:54.478 --> 02:56.001
UNH!

03:00.876 --> 03:02.834
COVER ME.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.193
WE'RE TOO LATE.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.956
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

03:41.090 --> 03:44.572
HEH. OUR PIER.

03:44.615 --> 03:47.009
I TOOK YOU FISHING
HERE ONCE.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.924
WHY ONLY ONCE?

03:48.967 --> 03:51.361
YOU JUMPED IN.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.059
OH, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO,

03:54.103 --> 03:55.974
BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.325
HEH HEH HEH.
YOU NEVER LISTENED.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.416
SHE TOOK AFTER HER MOTHER.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.290
YOU'RE NOT CALLIE.

04:07.334 --> 04:10.380
NO. THIS IS WHO YOU CHOSE.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.643
WE MOST OFTEN TAKE THE FORM
OF THE SUBJECT'S

04:12.687 --> 04:14.471
GREATEST TEACHER

04:14.515 --> 04:17.518
OR THE SOURCE
OF THEIR GREATEST FAILURE.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.737
IN THE RARE
EMOTION-DRIVEN SPECIES

04:19.781 --> 04:21.348
SUCH AS YOUR OWN,

04:21.391 --> 04:23.698
IT CAN BE
THEIR GREATEST LOVE.

04:23.741 --> 04:27.397
SEEMS YOU'RE FACED
WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.790
ARE YOU GOD?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.531
HEH.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.664
FOR OUR PURPOSES,
YOU MAY CONSIDER ME
YOUR JUDGE.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.320
MY JUDGE? SO THEY
WERE RIGHT.

04:37.364 --> 04:41.933
THIS IS A TRIAL,
A TEST, NOT A WAR.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.587
CORRECT.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.634
THE LAST OF YOUR KIND
TO STAND BEFORE US--BECCA--

04:46.677 --> 04:48.810
REFUSED THE TEST.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.378
TELL ME...DAD,

04:51.421 --> 04:53.945
IS THE HUMAN RACE NOW
READY TO JOIN US?

04:53.989 --> 04:56.557
YES...
WE ARE READY.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.385
EXCELLENT.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.648
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
WE TALK,

05:00.691 --> 05:03.390
I ASK QUESTIONS,
YOU ANSWER TRUTHFULLY.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.870
IF YOU DO NOT,
I WILL KNOW IT.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.959
IF YOUR ANSWERS ARE
SATISFACTORY,

05:08.003 --> 05:09.570
YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS
AND THAT

05:09.613 --> 05:12.224
OF YOUR ENTIRE SPECIES
WILL BECOME ONE WITH OURS.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.966
YOU WILL TRANSCEND
YOUR HUMAN FORM
AND BECOME INFINITE.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.665
IF YOU FAIL TO EARN
THIS EVOLUTIONARY LEAP,

05:17.708 --> 05:19.580
YOU WILL BE ELIMINATED,

05:19.623 --> 05:21.364
TURNED TO CRYSTAL THE WAY
THE BARDOANS

05:21.408 --> 05:24.324
AND COUNTLESS OTHER
CIVILIZATIONS
BEFORE THEM WERE.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.847
SOUND GOOD?

05:27.718 --> 05:30.373
THE FIRST QUESTION IS
ABOUT LOVE.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.245
SO FEW SPECIES ARE
GIVEN THIS GIFT,

05:33.289 --> 05:37.337
YET YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED
TO ERASE IT IN PURSUIT
OF THIS MOMENT.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.251
WHY?

05:56.965 --> 05:58.401
PENCILS DOWN.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.800
JORDAN: UNH!
MILLER: MY TURN.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.063
GET SOME WATER.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.282
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE
GETTING CLOSER.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.814
GAIA TOOK THE LAST
OF THE WATER
ON HER HUNT.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.166
I'LL GO TO THE RIVER.

06:40.965 --> 06:44.839
HA. I HATE WAITING.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.057
DONE TOO MUCH
OF IT.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.842
TRUST ME, I KNOW.

06:50.671 --> 06:54.109
BUT OCTAVIA AND CLARKE
CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.764
THANK YOU.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.462
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS
ARE FOR.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.029
FRIENDS, HUH?

07:12.432 --> 07:15.435
CAN...FRIENDS
DO THIS?

07:27.229 --> 07:28.709
OH, THEY'RE BACK!

07:30.232 --> 07:32.843
INDRA: FORM UP!
ATTACK ON MY ORDERS!

07:42.592 --> 07:44.333
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

07:44.376 --> 07:47.118
RAVEN: SAVING OUR ASSES
AGAIN.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.558
THANK YOU.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.908
IT'S WHAT HATCH WOULD DO.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.823
-STONE'S RIGHT THROUGH THERE.
-COPY THAT.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.128
THE REST OF YOU BEAT IT
UNLESS YOU WANT

07:57.172 --> 07:58.695
A LUNG FULL
OF PULVERIZED BUNKER.

07:58.739 --> 08:03.091
MILLER: HEY! WE'VE GOT
PEOPLE DOWN THERE.

08:03.134 --> 08:06.094
SO YOU DO.
HEAR THAT, BOYS?

08:06.137 --> 08:07.878
MAN: YEP.
NIKKI: SET PHASERS TO STUN.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.445
MAN: YOU GOT IT.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.491
IT'S NOT JACKSON.
HE'S FINE.

08:11.534 --> 08:12.840
IN SANCTUM TREATING
EMORI.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.276
MURPHY'S WITH THEM.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.886
HOPE: IT'S GOT TO BE
ECHO OR NIYLAH THEN.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.192
WHY NOT THE OTHERS?

08:17.235 --> 08:18.628
INDRA: THERE ARE NO OTHERS.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.065
GABRIEL'S DEAD. CADOGAN
HAS MADI ON BARDO.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.067
CLARKE AND OCTAVIA WENT
TO GET HER BACK.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.330
THEY'RE TO RETURN FOR US
SO WE CAN HELP STOP HIM.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.984
NIKKI: FIRE IN THE HOLE!

08:28.812 --> 08:30.597
THEN LET'S DO THAT.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.555
MILLER: HOW? CADOGAN
WILL BE MOBILIZING
HIS ARMY FOR WAR.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.296
WE GOT 10 PEOPLE.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.689
INDRA: WITH SHEIDHEDA DEAD,
WONKRU WILL FIGHT.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.038
WE GO TO SANCTUM FIRST.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.040
WONKRU WILL LOSE, INDRA.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.563
HOPE: MILLER'S RIGHT.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.435
WHAT WE NEED IS
A DISTRACTION, NOT A FIGHT,

08:43.479 --> 08:46.830
A WAY TO GET A SMALL TEAM
PAST THEIR ARMY TO
KILL CADOGAN.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.356
ENERGY WEAPONS.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.402
THEIR WEAPONS REQUIRE
ENERGY, TOO.

08:53.445 --> 08:58.059
TOO BAD WE WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT
WE'RE FIRING OURS AT.

08:58.102 --> 09:01.236
MAYBE WE WILL.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.934
NIKKI: LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.414
ECHO: HOPE!

09:08.199 --> 09:10.593
NIKKI: MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WE'RE THROUGH THE COLLAPSE.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.421
GOOD. THEN LET'S GO.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.249
INDRA: WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT GAIA?

09:14.292 --> 09:15.946
I'M SORRY. CLARKE
AND OCTAVIA ARE
IN TROUBLE ON BARDO.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.513
SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.167
INDRA, WE CAN'T
WAIT FOR HER.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.603
MILLER: SLOW DOWN.
WE STILL DON'T HAVE A PLAN

09:20.647 --> 09:22.300
THAT DOESN'T END
WITH ALL OF US DEAD.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.564
ACTUALLY, I THINK JORDAN WAS
JUST ABOUT TO TELL US ONE.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.438
THIS ONE WOULD MAKE
MY FATHER PROUD.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.411
FOR MY FIRST TRICK,

09:46.455 --> 09:49.676
I WILL MAKE AN ARMY APPEAR.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.465
I'M OFFLINE. WEAPONS
NOT RESPONSIVE.

09:56.508 --> 09:57.640
I'VE GOT NOTHING.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.337
NONE OF US DO.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.080
INDRA: THIS IS NOT
THE STONE ROOM.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.734
THE DISTRACTION CAN
STILL WORK.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.606
INSERTION TEAM, GO NOW!

10:06.649 --> 10:08.433
RAVEN: COPY THAT.
ECHO, LEAD THE WAY.

10:08.477 --> 10:11.306
THE REST OF YOU,
INTO THE TREES!

10:13.351 --> 10:15.136
THE LAST WAR
IS HERE!

10:15.179 --> 10:16.703
THEIR WEAPONS
ARE DOWN.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.487
WHY AREN'T THEY
ATTACKING?

10:18.530 --> 10:21.446
MAN: MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

10:34.242 --> 10:37.027
WELL, THEY'RE
DISTRACTED.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.246
YEAH. LONG ENOUGH
FOR US TO DIE.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.682
WE ALL WILL DIE.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.162
WHEN IS OUT
OF OUR CONTROL.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.554
THIS IS A GOOD HOW.

10:46.341 --> 10:49.387
SHE'S AS STABLE
AS SHE'S GONNA GET.
IT'S TIME.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.911
MILLER: JAX.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.220
THANK GOD.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.138
RAVEN GOT YOU OUT?

11:01.182 --> 11:04.489
YEAH. SHE AND WONKRU
JUST LEFT FOR BARDO.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.274
WITHOUT YOU?

11:06.317 --> 11:08.015
I'M NOT LEAVING
YOU AGAIN.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.366
WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT,
WE STICK TOGETHER.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.891
MURPHY: I AM GLAD
YOU ARE SAFE.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.763
NOW HOW ABOUT
MY REUNION?

11:21.158 --> 11:22.769
MILLER: WHAT CAN I DO?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.727
HELP HOLD HER STEADY
WHILE I TAKE THIS OUT.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.294
IF SHE MOVES,

11:26.337 --> 11:27.817
IT'LL CAUSE
EVEN MORE DAMAGE.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.645
-YOU UNDERSTAND?
-YEAH.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.388
JACKSON: ON 3.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.825
1...

11:35.869 --> 11:37.392
2...

11:37.435 --> 11:38.959
3.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.182
MURPHY: HEY, HEY!

11:45.226 --> 11:47.663
HEY. COME ON.
EMORI, EMORI! EMORI!

11:47.707 --> 11:49.317
JACKSON: SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.710
I HAVE TO GET IN THERE
SURGICALLY AND FIND THE--

11:50.753 --> 11:53.190
HURRY UP!

11:54.888 --> 11:56.454
NO, EMORI!

11:59.066 --> 12:00.458
ADRENALINE.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.993
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.387
DO SOMETHING!
COME ON! DO SOMETHING!

12:16.431 --> 12:18.128
YOU'RE A DOCTOR! PLEASE!

12:19.956 --> 12:21.566
NO.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.441
NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:26.484 --> 12:29.009
HEY, HEY.

12:29.052 --> 12:32.577
EMORI. NO.

12:32.621 --> 12:36.103
EMORI, PLEASE.
EMORI, PLEASE.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.568
TAKE OUT
HER MIND DRIVE.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.049
-PLEASE.
-PLEASE WHAT?

13:09.092 --> 13:10.964
PUT HER MIND
IN YOUR HEAD?

13:11.007 --> 13:14.489
WE KNOW FROM CLARKE
AND JOSEPHINE HOW THAT ENDS.

13:14.532 --> 13:15.882
FINE.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.146
-I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
-MUR...

13:26.544 --> 13:28.459
IF YOU DIED

13:28.503 --> 13:30.853
AND I COULD SEE
YOU AGAIN,

13:30.897 --> 13:32.594
I WOULD DO
THE SAME THING.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.254
JACKSON: I GOT THIS.

13:42.386 --> 13:45.302
LEVITT: YOU DO REALIZE
THAT IF CLARKE CAN'T
STOP THE TEST

13:45.346 --> 13:47.304
THEN WE ARE BUYING TIME
FOR WANHEDA

13:47.348 --> 13:50.830
TO BE THE WITNESS
FOR THE HUMAN RACE.

13:50.873 --> 13:54.268
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

13:54.311 --> 13:56.923
IF SHE GETS IT DONE,

13:56.966 --> 13:59.142
WILL MY BROTHER
TRANSCEND?

13:59.186 --> 14:03.799
NO. SHEPHERD'S PASSAGE,
"BOOK OF BARDO,"

14:03.843 --> 14:05.670
CHAPTER 1, VERSE 6.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.411
"DEATH IS THE END,
MY FRIEND.

14:07.455 --> 14:10.458
ONLY THE LIVING
SHALL TRANSCEND."

14:10.501 --> 14:12.373
MUST HAVE SLEPT
THROUGH THAT CLASS.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.510
-WHAT?
-IF SHE DOES TAKE THE TEST,

14:19.554 --> 14:21.861
THEN TODAY'S THE END.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.646
EITHER WAY, TRANSCENDENCE
OR EXTINCTION...

14:27.867 --> 14:30.608
I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO LIVE A LITTLE FIRST.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.959
SAME.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.395
RAVEN: SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.875
OHH!

14:40.531 --> 14:43.534
-WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
-WE DID.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.145
RAVEN: DON'T TELL ME
CADOGAN KILLED MADI.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.624
OCTAVIA: WORSE
THAN KILLED HER.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.322
CLARKE WENT IN AFTER HIM
TO STOP THE TEST.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.540
RAVEN: WENT IN?
LEVITT: HOW DO YOU KNOW

14:49.584 --> 14:50.977
YOU WEREN'T FOLLOWED?

14:51.020 --> 14:52.456
RAVEN: HEY.
YOU CAN RELAX.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.631
THE DISCIPLES HAVE
THEIR HANDS FULL

14:53.675 --> 14:54.937
WITH WONKRU RIGHT NOW.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.330
WHAT, YOU BROUGHT
AN ARMY HERE?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.245
ECHO: THEY'RE NOT
HERE TO FIGHT.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.073
IT WAS A DISTRACTION
TO GET US INSIDE

15:00.116 --> 15:02.118
-SO WE CAN KILL CADOGAN.
-THE DISCIPLES DON'T KNOW THAT.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.120
IF CLARKE CAN'T
STOP THE TEST TO
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

15:04.164 --> 15:05.948
THE HUMAN RACE DESERVES
TO TRANSCEND

15:05.992 --> 15:07.950
WHILE WHAT'S LEFT
OF THE HUMAN RACE
IS FIGHTING A WAR...

15:07.994 --> 15:10.126
RAVEN: THAT WOULD BE BAD.
LEVITT: WORSE THAN BAD.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.346
IF WE FAIL,
THE TRANSCENDENTS
SEND GEM9.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.217
THE SPY UNDERSTANDS.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.916
LOOK. I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID
TO YOU, OK?

15:16.959 --> 15:18.656
I WASN'T MYSELF.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.136
OCTAVIA: WE'LL MAKE
FRIENDS LATER.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.529
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO
STOP THE WAR.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.139
LEVITT, ON ME.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.314
ECHO: I'M GOING
WITH THEM.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.621
RAVEN, GET
THAT BRIDGE OPEN.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.977
YOU DON'T SEE THAT
EVERY DAY.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.684
WHY AM I STILL HERE?

15:46.728 --> 15:48.425
LEXA: YOU KNOW WHY.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.868
LEXA.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.881
I'M NOT HER, CLARKE.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.579
I KNOW.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.069
THE TEST ISN'T OVER?

16:23.112 --> 16:28.117
NO. I'M SORRY.
WE CAN'T STOP WHAT'S
BEEN SET IN MOTION.

16:28.161 --> 16:31.555
YOUR SPECIES MUST NOW
BE JUDGED THROUGH YOU.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.651
THIS MAN WAS UNARMED,
NO THREAT TO YOU,

16:40.695 --> 16:44.090
YET YOU KILLED HIM.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.613
WHY?

16:48.268 --> 16:52.359
HE KILLED
MY DAUGHTER.

16:52.402 --> 16:55.057
IS MADI DEAD?

16:55.101 --> 17:00.106
NO, BUT SHE WILL BE
BECAUSE OF HIM.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.412
SO YOUR NEED FOR REVENGE
IS MORE IMPORTANT

17:02.456 --> 17:04.110
THAN THE FATE
OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE?

17:04.153 --> 17:08.288
IT'S NOT REVENGE.
IT'S JUSTICE.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.811
CLARKE...

17:20.430 --> 17:22.345
YOU DON'T KNOW
MY PAIN.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.565
YOU'RE WRONG.
DURING THE TEST,

17:24.608 --> 17:27.524
I SENSE EVERY PART OF YOU.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.483
I'M FEELING YOUR PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.094
REALLY?

17:32.138 --> 17:37.056
THEN FEEL ME HOLDING
LEXA AS SHE DIES.

17:37.099 --> 17:40.711
FEEL ME SEEING SOMEONE
ELSE WEAR MY MOTHER'S FACE.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.456
FEEL ME MURDER
MY BEST FRIEND

17:46.500 --> 17:48.197
TO SAVE MY CHILD,

17:48.241 --> 17:50.721
ONLY TO HAVE
HER DIE ANYWAY.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.942
FEEL THAT.

17:53.985 --> 17:56.031
YOU SUFFER

17:56.075 --> 17:59.426
AND INFLICT SUFFERING
ON OTHERS.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.298
PAIN BEGETS PAIN.
THAT'S NOT JUSTICE, CLARKE.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.086
YOU SAY YOU DO THESE THINGS
TO PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE,

18:07.129 --> 18:10.567
BUT YOU'RE ALL ONE...PEOPLE.

18:10.611 --> 18:14.049
THAT MUCH CADOGAN
HAD RIGHT.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.879
HE CREATED A WORLD
WITHOUT LOVE

18:17.922 --> 18:19.707
TO GET TO YOU.

18:19.750 --> 18:23.145
HE KILLED MY CHILD
TO GET TO YOU.

18:23.189 --> 18:26.844
HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDERED THAT
YOU'RE THE PROBLEM?

18:26.888 --> 18:30.326
HOW DARE YOU
JUDGE ME

18:30.370 --> 18:32.763
WHEN YOU ANNIHILATE
ENTIRE SPECIES

18:32.807 --> 18:35.679
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
LIVE UP TO YOUR IDEALS?

18:35.723 --> 18:38.987
HAVE I PULLED THE LEVER
TO COMMIT GENOCIDE?

18:39.030 --> 18:40.989
YES, I HAVE.

18:42.599 --> 18:45.472
AND DID LOVE MAKE
ME DO THIS?

18:45.515 --> 18:47.691
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
IT DID!

18:50.259 --> 18:52.348
BUT WHAT'S
YOUR EXCUSE?

18:52.392 --> 18:54.916
YOU PLAY GAMES
WITH PEOPLE

18:54.959 --> 18:59.007
AND CALL YOURSELVES
HIGHER BEINGS.

18:59.050 --> 19:03.011
YOU ARE NO BETTER
THAN THE MURDERERS
I'VE KILLED,

19:03.054 --> 19:06.057
AND YOU ARE NO BETTER
THAN ME!

19:07.450 --> 19:10.236
I AM SORRY FOR ALL
YOU HAVE LOST.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.151
YOU'VE BORNE SO MUCH...

19:13.587 --> 19:18.461
BUT IF YOU ARE HUMANITY,

19:18.505 --> 19:20.507
THEN I'M AFRAID HUMANITY
IS NOT WORTHY

19:20.550 --> 19:22.335
OF TAKING THE NEXT STEP.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.513
IT HAS BEEN DECIDED.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.818
MURPHY: I REMEMBER THAT.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.649
THE PLACE
WE FIRST MET.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.173
LOVE AT FIRST KNIFE
TO THROAT.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.657
OH, YOU ARE
SO BEAUTIFUL.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.355
JOHN, WHERE ARE WE?

20:26.399 --> 20:29.837
JOSEPHINE CALLED IT
THE MINDSPACE.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.013
IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I WOULD HAVE
CHOSEN OUR CAVE,

20:32.056 --> 20:33.406
BUT...

20:35.930 --> 20:38.498
I DIED.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.151
YOU DID.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.154
-NOT ACCEPTABLE.
-HEH HEH.

20:45.461 --> 20:46.854
HMM.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.076
YOU PUT MY MIND DRIVE
IN YOUR HEAD.

20:53.469 --> 20:58.822
TWO MINDS, ONE BODY.
YOU'LL DIE, TOO.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.476
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.261
WITHOUT YOU, I'D JUST
BE SURVIVING, EMORI.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.175
-I WOULDN'T BE LIVING.
-NO.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.830
HEY, HEY, HEY.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.658
I WOULD TAKE A FEW MORE
HOURS WITH YOU

21:08.702 --> 21:10.530
OVER FOREVER WITHOUT.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.663
NO, NO, NO.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.404
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

21:15.448 --> 21:18.712
I WON'T LET YOU
DO THIS, SO WAKE UP.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.453
-EMORI.
-WAKE UP.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.977
JUST WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!

21:23.020 --> 21:25.153
WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

21:25.196 --> 21:27.460
JACKSON! JACKSON,
WAKE HIM UP!

21:27.503 --> 21:29.636
-EMORI.
-DON'T LET HIM DO THIS.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.551
EMORI: JACKSON!
JOHN, JOHN!

21:31.594 --> 21:34.075
-STOP, STOP, HEY.
-DON'T! LET GO OF ME!

21:34.118 --> 21:36.338
THIS IS OK WITH ME.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.340
NO. IT'S NOT OK
WITH ME.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.168
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.520

23:02.468 --> 23:04.992
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

23:05.035 --> 23:06.428
CLARKE, WAIT!

23:06.472 --> 23:08.387
DID YOU TAKE THE TEST?

23:08.430 --> 23:11.085
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.479
I FAILED.

23:13.522 --> 23:16.569
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU,
NOT ME.

23:16.612 --> 23:19.398
THEY SHOULD HAVE PICKED
YOU FIRST.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.878
SO THAT'S IT?

23:21.922 --> 23:25.099
WE DON'T TRANSCEND?

23:25.142 --> 23:28.450
WE'RE WIPED OUT?
IT'S OVER?

23:28.494 --> 23:30.409
WELL, CAN WE CHANGE
THEIR MINDS?

23:31.845 --> 23:35.065
I DON'T KNOW.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.503
I NEED TO BE WITH MADI.
THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.243
CLARKE, WAIT!

23:57.784 --> 24:00.221
AH. TOUCHING A PULSAR.
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

24:12.842 --> 24:14.670
NO WAY.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.501
WAIT. WHERE'S EARTH?

24:19.545 --> 24:21.895
ABOUT 42 BILLION
LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

24:31.078 --> 24:33.167
YOU READ OUR THOUGHTS
AND TAKE THE FORM

24:33.210 --> 24:34.516
OF SOMEONE WE LOVE.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.518
VERY GOOD.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.912
YOURS IS
AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.392
NOT YOUR REAL MOTHER,

24:41.436 --> 24:45.440
YET HER OPINION OF YOU
MATTERED EVEN MORE.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.616
YOU FEAR HER JUDGMENT.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.009
AM I HERE TO TALK
ABOUT ME?

24:49.052 --> 24:50.750
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

24:50.793 --> 24:52.229
THE TEST IS OVER.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.666
AS YOU KNOW,
CLARKE FAILED.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.537
HOW CAN THAT BE?
CLARKE SACRIFICED

24:55.581 --> 24:57.974
EVERYTHING FOR US
SO THAT WE DIDN'T
HAVE TO.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.150
SHE GAVE UP HER SOUL
SO WE COULD KEEP OURS.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.022
SHE COMMITTED ATROCITIES.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.371
SHE WAS TRYING TO
SAVE US.

25:03.414 --> 25:06.896
SHE DOOMED YOU.
I'M SORRY.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.464
ARE YOU?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.639
BECAUSE TO ME,
IT LOOKS LIKE

25:10.683 --> 25:12.032
YOU DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.251
HAVE WE MADE MISTAKES?
YES.

25:14.295 --> 25:15.775
CLARKE, ME, ALL OF US,

25:15.818 --> 25:19.648
BUT WE WERE JUST
TRYING TO SURVIVE.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.389
I'M NOT SAYING WE'RE
READY NOW,

25:21.432 --> 25:23.783
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
US TO JOIN YOU, FINE...

25:25.393 --> 25:27.351
BUT AT LEAST LET
US LIVE,

25:27.395 --> 25:28.918
KEEP TRYING
TO DO BETTER.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.138
WE WILL. WE HAVE.

25:31.181 --> 25:34.097
YOU SAY YOU HAVE,

25:34.141 --> 25:37.144
YET EVEN NOW YOU ARE POISED
AND ON THE BRINK

25:37.187 --> 25:39.059
OF SELF-EXTERMINATION.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.018
LOOK.

25:51.462 --> 25:54.161
YOU SAY YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO BETTER,

25:54.204 --> 25:57.381
BUT ALL I SEE ARE TWO TRIBES
OF FRIGHTENED CREATURES

25:57.425 --> 26:00.820
WILLING TO KILL THE OTHER
TO SAVE THEMSELVES.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.561
BUT THEY'RE NOT FIGHTING.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.258
IT WAS JUST
A DISTRACTION.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.477
THIS PROVES NOTHING.

26:06.521 --> 26:09.872
THEY WILL FIGHT, RAVEN,
LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.787
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
KNOW THAT.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.702
HMM.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.621
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.149
STOP! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

26:26.193 --> 26:28.674
THEY CAN'T SEE
OR HEAR YOU.

26:28.717 --> 26:31.198
YOU CANNOT STOP THIS.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.634
NO ONE CAN.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.601
