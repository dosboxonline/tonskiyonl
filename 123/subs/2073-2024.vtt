00:41.125 --> 00:43.461
<i>I hope someone finds this.</i>

00:43.794 --> 00:48.339
<i>No one said or did anything to stop them.</i>

00:48.340 --> 00:50.760
<i>It’s too late for me.</i>

00:51.093 --> 00:52.470
<i>I was alone.</i>

00:53.512 --> 00:55.306
<i>It may not be too late for you.</i>

03:40.638 --> 03:42.013
Come on!

03:48.646 --> 03:51.482
<i>America's changed,
you understand that?</i>

03:52.691 --> 03:55.735
<i>I think to create the perfect
union of democracy</i>

03:55.736 --> 03:58.072
<i>has been a struggle...</i>

04:32.481 --> 04:34.107
<i>Dear passengers,</i>

04:34.108 --> 04:36.859
<i>people who behave disorderly
in public areas</i>

04:36.860 --> 04:39.446
<i>will be punished according
to regulations,</i>

04:39.655 --> 04:41.907
<i>and their behaviour will be recorded.</i>

04:42.074 --> 04:45.368
<i>To avoid any negative record
of personal credit,</i>

04:45.369 --> 04:47.704
<i>please follow the relevant regulations.</i>

05:27.494 --> 05:30.205
So, whatever else happens now,
it’s all in a day’s work.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.675
<i>I can still remember my grandma.</i>

07:10.430 --> 07:12.849
<i>I used to help her out.</i>

07:12.850 --> 07:14.559
<i>My grandma used to say her memories</i>

07:14.560 --> 07:18.105
<i>were slipping through
her fingers like sand.</i>

07:18.814 --> 07:20.440
<i>She said, we didn’t know it,</i>

07:21.483 --> 07:23.986
<i>but that was happening to all of us too.</i>

07:25.362 --> 07:29.867
<i>She said soon,
there’d be no past, no history.</i>

07:31.160 --> 07:35.247
<i>She said it was the truth,
and she didn’t care who heard.</i>

07:36.748 --> 07:39.668
<i>Then one day, they came for her,</i>

07:40.878 --> 07:43.505
<i>and she was gone.</i>

07:46.758 --> 07:48.927
<i>That stabbed to the heart of me,</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:51.805
<i>it silenced me.</i>

07:52.181 --> 07:54.099
<i>I never spoke again.</i>

07:56.643 --> 07:58.270
<i>I ran.</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:03.025
<i>I’m still running.</i>

08:17.789 --> 08:20.374
<i>My life’s turned into
one of those sci-fi comics</i>

08:20.375 --> 08:21.793
<i>I used to read.</i>

08:23.503 --> 08:25.088
<i>I live off-grid.</i>

08:27.883 --> 08:31.220
<i>My place is in Shoes,
on the lower ground.</i>

08:38.018 --> 08:39.811
<i>There are others here.</i>

08:42.272 --> 08:43.774
<i>Survivors.</i>

08:45.943 --> 08:47.486
<i>Renegades.</i>

08:58.205 --> 09:00.623
Know what I'm saying?
Anyone know why I’m saying this?

09:00.624 --> 09:02.792
<i>There’s a tunnel up to Fragrances,</i>

09:02.793 --> 09:04.752
<i>where the old entrance was.</i>

09:08.757 --> 09:11.426
<i>It’s one of the six ways
up to the surface.</i>

10:18.785 --> 10:20.162
Hey, Ghost.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.331
Going up?

10:23.582 --> 10:24.832
Stay safe.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.209
<i>I met this guy, Jack,</i>

10:27.210 --> 10:30.129
<i>dumpster-diving one night.</i>

10:30.130 --> 10:31.505
<i>It was me who got him in here.</i>

10:31.506 --> 10:34.509
Hey, I’ve found an old picture
you might like.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.304
<i>He’s got these goofy,</i>
p <i>uppy dog eyes.</i>

10:38.305 --> 10:39.972
I’ll show it to you later.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.558
<i>He’s an AI.</i>

10:42.267 --> 10:43.477
Stay safe.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.813
<i>He listens and watches everything.</i>

10:51.068 --> 10:53.070
<i>You can’t trust anyone anymore.</i>

11:01.078 --> 11:04.622
<i>When you glean up
on the surface, after curfew,</i>

11:04.623 --> 11:06.083
<i>you have to be quick.</i>

11:08.502 --> 11:10.461
<i>You avoid the dogs,</i>

11:10.462 --> 11:12.881
<i>you dodge the street militia.</i>

11:44.121 --> 11:47.164
<i>Move north,
destruction area north.</i>

11:47.165 --> 11:49.625
<i>This is now a civil disturbance.</i>

11:49.626 --> 11:52.378
<i>Failure to do so could result
in arrest and the use of force,</i>

11:52.379 --> 11:54.131
<i>including riot patrol agents and...</i>

11:56.007 --> 11:58.260
<i>People thought the world would end.</i>

12:01.930 --> 12:03.681
<i>But the world goes on.</i>

12:14.443 --> 12:16.403
<i>It's us who will end.</i>

12:20.991 --> 12:23.577
<i>...must leave
the area immediately.</i>

12:23.869 --> 12:27.371
<i>Failure to comply with this
order may subject you to arrest</i>

12:27.372 --> 12:30.458
<i>and may subject you to the use
of riot patrol agents</i>

12:30.459 --> 12:31.710
<i>or impact weapons.</i>

12:34.254 --> 12:36.381
<i>This is the police department.</i>

12:36.673 --> 12:40.010
<i>You are violating state imposed curfew.</i>

12:41.136 --> 12:44.555
<i>Go home or you will be arrested.</i>

12:57.527 --> 12:59.613
<i>Gleaning is how we get by.</i>

13:00.864 --> 13:05.118
<i>We pick over the leftovers,
the broken, the rejected...</i>

13:05.660 --> 13:07.537
<i>anything we can use.</i>

13:10.957 --> 13:14.127
Thanks, Ghost. I love it!

13:15.378 --> 13:17.255
<i>Those puppy dog eyes.</i>

13:17.672 --> 13:19.549
I love this hat.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.994
<i>I have no mercy or compassion in me</i>

13:48.995 --> 13:51.580
<i>for a society that will crush people,</i>

13:51.581 --> 13:54.792
<i>and then penalise them for not
being able to stand up</i>

13:54.793 --> 13:56.711
<i>under the weight.</i>

14:04.928 --> 14:06.054
<i>How did we get here?</i>

14:07.180 --> 14:08.639
<i>How did we let this happen?</i>

14:09.766 --> 14:11.684
In the late 1980s, early 1990s,

14:11.685 --> 14:14.729
you were in a moment of
democratic triumph.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.191
We’re now in a democratic recession,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.318
and it’s endemic in Eastern Europe,

14:21.319 --> 14:22.319
in Western Europe,

14:22.320 --> 14:24.655
in the United States, India,

14:24.656 --> 14:26.324
the Philippines.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.034
This is a new age of impunity.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.787
Some countries are actually
just going back to the age

14:31.788 --> 14:33.290
of elite power.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.333
The financial system is rocked
to its foundation,

14:36.334 --> 14:38.377
as top Wall Street institutions...

14:38.378 --> 14:41.171
If you have an economic crisis,

14:41.172 --> 14:44.049
and/or a refugee crisis,

14:44.050 --> 14:45.801
these demagogues rise.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.636
They’re promising to protect
you from a threat

14:47.637 --> 14:49.306
that doesn’t exist.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.937
You have an incredibly dishonest
right-wing media,

14:56.938 --> 14:58.355
who pushes disinformation.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.360
Hate and fear are being sown

15:03.361 --> 15:05.988
online across the world,

15:05.989 --> 15:12.037
spreading lies paid for with
illegal cash. It’s subversion.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.292
What Putin saw, is, he's like,

15:18.293 --> 15:21.046
“Holy shit, I can hack this system,

15:21.463 --> 15:24.799
and then control global
capitalism, and politics.”

15:29.554 --> 15:31.347
There are transnational oligarchs

15:31.348 --> 15:33.766
funding dark money think-tanks

15:33.767 --> 15:35.309
and fake institutions.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.935
Americans for prosperity.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.730
Renowned Washington
think-tank, the Cato Institute.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.983
The Institute of Economic Affairs.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.569
They’re lobby shops, set up
to influence politics

15:45.570 --> 15:49.866
on behalf of ideological
billionaires and big business.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.993
BP is a corporate donor to the lEA.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.371
They come to tons of our events.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.997
BP might say, you know,

15:56.998 --> 15:59.583
"We at BP are really struggling
with these regulations.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.170
Can you tell me why you're not going
to change this, Minister?"

16:02.379 --> 16:04.381
It’s disrupting democracy.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.468
Social media has enabled
the rise of these populist

16:09.469 --> 16:11.596
authoritarian-style leaders.

16:12.389 --> 16:16.308
We will root out the communists, Marxists,

16:16.309 --> 16:18.602
fascists and the radical left thugs

16:18.603 --> 16:22.774
that live like vermin within
the confines of our country.

16:24.234 --> 16:28.029
We will make America great again.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.949
Jews will not replace us!

16:31.700 --> 16:36.412
So, you would say that white
supremacist tied publications

16:36.413 --> 16:39.416
meet a rigorous standard
for fact-checking?

16:41.668 --> 16:44.378
Facebook’s site has
been used to incite violence

16:44.379 --> 16:47.090
against Rohingya refugees in Myanmar.

16:47.298 --> 16:51.511
Mr Modi has driven Muslims of
this country to the wall.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.096
I have a particular responsibility,

16:54.097 --> 16:57.516
it is to end the free movement
of people once and for all.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.185
Europe is in the heat
of a battle

17:00.186 --> 17:02.146
about the future of democracy,

17:02.147 --> 17:04.649
and Hungary is now the front line.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.235
It’s not just Putin and Orbán,

17:08.236 --> 17:10.447
there’s an alliance of dictatorships.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.740
There’s no subtlety

17:12.741 --> 17:16.744
in Netanyahu’s ambition to claim
all of the Palestinian state.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.912
There’s a global effort by people in power

17:18.913 --> 17:20.582
to stay in power.

17:21.166 --> 17:25.669
They care more about maintaining
power for their clique,

17:25.670 --> 17:28.840
than a broader sense of common good.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.354
Hitler massacred three million Jews.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.317
There's three million drug addicts,

17:50.195 --> 17:51.905
I'd be happy to slaughter them.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.908
The volume of killing
here is quite extraordinary.

17:55.909 --> 17:59.661
In the 80 or so days
that Duterte has been in power,

17:59.662 --> 18:03.540
there’s now been an average of
somewhere between 35 and 40

18:03.541 --> 18:07.669
police killings of drug-pushers
and drug users every day.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.757
So no qualms about killing killers?

18:10.965 --> 18:14.761
Yes, of course. I must admit, I have killed.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.973
I’m a journalist. This is my
37th year as a journalist.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.643
What’s the role of journalism?
Journalism, the mission:

18:22.644 --> 18:25.437
holding power to account,
public and private.

18:25.438 --> 18:29.066
As President, you now also
defend the constitution.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.526
- Yes.
- You break the law,

18:30.527 --> 18:31.777
you threaten to break the law.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.821
You said you had killed a year ago, right?

18:33.822 --> 18:34.905
You told me that,

18:34.906 --> 18:37.616
and yet you now have the task of

18:37.617 --> 18:39.034
keeping the rule of law

18:39.035 --> 18:41.037
and you said you would do
that also. How do you...?

18:41.287 --> 18:42.204
Because the rule of law

18:42.205 --> 18:43.789
there must be fear.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.668
When Duterte took office,
our institutions crumbled.

18:47.669 --> 18:50.754
He became the most powerful
person within six months.

18:50.755 --> 18:55.050
Just because you're a journalist you think
you are except from assassination.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.218
It's all wrong.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.178
We continue doing our reporting.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.192
How do you feel killing Muslims?

19:12.193 --> 19:13.235
I enjoy it.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.363
We killed them, came home and slept.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.244
<i>On the worst day of the violence,</i>

19:22.245 --> 19:24.538
<i>when murder and looting were taking place</i>

19:24.539 --> 19:28.375
<i>all across the city, we saw
policemen just standing by,</i>

19:28.376 --> 19:29.751
<i>watching what was happening</i>

19:29.752 --> 19:32.130
<i>but doing nothing to try to stop it.</i>

19:34.883 --> 19:37.092
When you look back over the last months,

19:37.093 --> 19:38.552
you’ve been the leader of this state

19:38.553 --> 19:40.220
through a very difficult period,

19:40.221 --> 19:41.388
do you think there’s anything that

19:41.389 --> 19:42.891
you should have done differently?

19:43.474 --> 19:48.855
Yes, one area where I was very, very weak,

19:48.855 --> 19:51.274
and that was how to handle the media.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.108
He doesn’t like criticism,

19:53.109 --> 19:54.067
he’s self-obsessed,

19:54.068 --> 19:55.402
he’s a megalomaniac,

19:55.403 --> 19:57.780
and I say that all the time.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.283
My name is Rana Ayyub.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.493
I’m a global opinions writer
with the Washington Post,

20:03.494 --> 20:04.912
I’m an investigative journalist.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.873
I write stuff which
the government does not like.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.083
Mr Modi is going from strength
to strength.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.920
He’s become a leader of anti-Muslim

20:12.921 --> 20:15.088
bigots across the country.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.506
I spoke about the fact that

20:16.507 --> 20:18.967
here is a man who’s an authoritarian,

20:18.968 --> 20:23.472
whose only politics is his
prejudice of Muslims,

20:23.473 --> 20:26.058
whose only politics is
persecution of Muslims,

20:26.059 --> 20:28.101
and if this man comes to power,

20:28.102 --> 20:29.645
he is going to repeat that,

20:29.646 --> 20:31.855
and that’s exactly what has transpired

20:31.856 --> 20:34.442
since Modi came to power in 2014.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.746
I believe that I’m standing up
for just bearing witness.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.456
I don’t even want to do anything.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.874
I don’t want to be anybody’s hero.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.793
I don’t want to be put on a pedestal.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.128
I just wanted to speak my truth.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.686
Nigel, Nigel, this way!

21:10.687 --> 21:11.478
Nigel!

21:11.479 --> 21:12.521
They know this referendum

21:12.522 --> 21:13.939
is too close to call,

21:13.940 --> 21:16.066
and are stepping up the intensity

21:16.067 --> 21:18.735
with just a week to go till polling day.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.405
When ISIS say they will use
the migrant crisis

21:21.406 --> 21:24.116
to flood the continent
with their Jihadi terrorists,

21:24.117 --> 21:24.992
they probably mean it.

21:24.993 --> 21:29.663
It's no good fighting
an election campaign on the facts

21:29.664 --> 21:32.416
Now, this is a once-in- a-lifetime chance

21:32.417 --> 21:35.962
for us to take back control
of our immigration system.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.547
because actually it's all about emotion.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.507
The majority of people in this country

21:40.508 --> 21:41.675
are suffering as a result of

21:41.676 --> 21:42.927
our membership of the European Union.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.804
These are things
that don't necessarily need to be true.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.390
As long as they're believed.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.517
If people feel that voting
doesn’t change anything,

21:50.518 --> 21:52.310
then violence is the next step.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.779
What I and other journalists
have uncovered

22:02.780 --> 22:05.908
is that multiple crimes took
place during the referendum.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.368
It was the biggest electoral fraud

22:08.369 --> 22:11.371
in Britain for 100 years.

22:11.372 --> 22:12.664
I’m a journalist.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.666
I kind of came into
investigative journalism

22:14.667 --> 22:16.710
accidentally, when I was a feature writer.

22:16.711 --> 22:19.254
This is what they were posting
on Facebook,

22:19.255 --> 22:21.715
paid for with illegal cash.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.592
How do you hold power to account?

22:23.593 --> 22:26.011
That’s all I’m trying to
figure out is like

22:26.012 --> 22:28.388
what are the different
mechanisms for holding

22:28.389 --> 22:29.681
power to account?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.850
Because the old ways don’t work any more.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.478
We have no idea who saw what ads,

22:34.479 --> 22:35.937
or even who placed the ads,

22:35.938 --> 22:37.731
or how much money was spent,

22:37.732 --> 22:40.401
or even what nationality they were.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.861
When I stumbled into this story,

22:42.862 --> 22:45.906
it was really like the scales
falling away from my eyes,

22:45.907 --> 22:48.658
and when I understood so much is actually

22:48.659 --> 22:51.244
controlled beyond the naked eye.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.954
If you’re interested, what I’d like to do

22:52.955 --> 22:56.958
is set up something,
and I’ll fund it somehow,

22:56.959 --> 22:59.252
that I think... and I think
you’re the perfect guy,

22:59.253 --> 23:00.545
we help knit together

23:00.546 --> 23:02.089
this populist nationalist movement

23:02.090 --> 23:03.131
throughout the world,

23:03.132 --> 23:04.549
'cause guys in Egypt are coming to me,

23:04.550 --> 23:06.218
the Modi's guys in India,

23:06.219 --> 23:11.556
Duterte, you know, and we get
Orbán, and we are somehow,

23:11.557 --> 23:13.643
some sort of convening authority.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.811
It’s a global revolt.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.866
The game-changer was the weaponisation

23:29.867 --> 23:31.077
of social media.

23:32.578 --> 23:36.124
I got 90 hate messages per hour.

23:36.791 --> 23:40.335
That’s when I began to realise,
this is really different.

23:40.336 --> 23:45.006
These tech companies enabled a real shift,

23:45.007 --> 23:51.763
because exponential lies
literally came at us so fast

23:51.764 --> 23:54.432
that our human capacity to absorb

23:54.433 --> 23:56.601
and fight back was gone.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.398
8.5 million tweets were directed
against me,

24:01.399 --> 24:05.902
in which the language is so
similar, Jihadi, burqa-clad,

24:05.903 --> 24:09.740
ISIS sex slave, you
know, terrorist sympathiser.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.952
I personally
got really targeted.

24:13.202 --> 24:17.206
There was this systemic
harassment going on online.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.959
It became overwhelming.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.294
The weaponisation of social media

24:22.295 --> 24:25.006
was quickly followed by
the weaponisation of the law.

24:25.173 --> 24:29.177
You reporters,
you will be allowed to criticise us

24:29.427 --> 24:32.512
but you will go to jail for your crime.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.222
A prominent critic of
Philippine President,

24:34.223 --> 24:36.099
Rodrigo Duterte, has been arrested.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.727
Maria Ressa is CEO and Executive Editor

24:38.728 --> 24:40.312
for the online news site, Rappler.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.772
Journalist Rana Ayyub,
who’s been a fierce critic

24:42.773 --> 24:44.983
of the government
led by Prime Minister Modi,

24:44.984 --> 24:46.985
has been named in a charge sheet filed

24:46.986 --> 24:50.114
by the Enforcement Directorate
over alleged money-laundering.

24:50.448 --> 24:51.907
Carol Cadwalladr, as a result

24:51.908 --> 24:54.201
of your reporting on Brexit,

24:54.202 --> 24:58.206
you have been sued by a British
businessman.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.583
This boys’ club
reads each other's manuals,

25:01.584 --> 25:02.918
okay, what have we done?

25:02.919 --> 25:06.129
Minorities silenced, media silenced,

25:06.130 --> 25:08.131
dissenters arrested, killed.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.342
Social media, we have co-opted them.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.802
Information technology, we have used them.

25:12.803 --> 25:14.387
They all follow the same play book.

25:14.388 --> 25:18.516
Now it fits, now it fits how you
make journalists and critics

25:18.517 --> 25:20.895
and activists enemies of the state.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.356
If you don’t have facts,
you can’t have truth.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.233
Without truth, you can’t
have trust.

25:26.234 --> 25:29.027
If you don’t have any of these three,

25:29.028 --> 25:30.737
you don’t have a shared reality.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.822
You can't solve any...

25:32.823 --> 25:34.783
like let alone existential problems

25:34.784 --> 25:37.244
like climate change,
you can’t solve any problem.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.247
You cannot have democracy.

25:41.916 --> 25:45.419
Isn’t this a science fiction
movie?

26:01.018 --> 26:03.729
<i>Grandma read newspapers,</i>

26:03.729 --> 26:06.357
<i>watched TV news non-stop.</i>

26:06.857 --> 26:08.984
<i>She recorded everything,</i>

26:08.985 --> 26:11.487
<i>said she was keeping the receipts.</i>

26:12.280 --> 26:15.700
<i>I didn’t understand, I was too young.</i>

26:16.951 --> 26:20.203
<i>News disappeared, just like Grandma.</i>

26:21.872 --> 26:24.000
<i>Nobody noticed or cared.</i>

26:38.556 --> 26:40.099
Name?

26:45.730 --> 26:47.356
Where were you born?

26:51.736 --> 26:55.031
Where in New San Francisco
have you visited?

27:24.185 --> 27:27.063
<i>Every day I pass the same
people on my way up.</i>

27:33.444 --> 27:35.780
<i>The girl who used to sing is gone.</i>

27:40.451 --> 27:44.579
<i>It’s like one by one
they’re turning into ghosts,</i>

27:44.580 --> 27:46.206
<i>or grains of sand.</i>

28:13.692 --> 28:15.486
<i>There was one place...</i>

28:17.154 --> 28:20.074
<i>a secret place my grandma
used to take me to.</i>

28:24.620 --> 28:25.912
<i>When I was small,</i>

28:25.913 --> 28:29.124
<i>I thought this was where people
came to pray.</i>

28:33.379 --> 28:35.923
<i>It was a place where you
could read books.</i>

28:38.384 --> 28:41.886
<i>There was special writing too,</i>

28:41.887 --> 28:44.306
<i>about things you couldn’t see,</i>

28:45.141 --> 28:46.599
<i>where you could meet people</i>

28:46.600 --> 28:48.518
<i>and not be afraid they’d rat you out</i>

28:48.519 --> 28:50.479
<i>to the authorities.</i>

29:02.116 --> 29:05.327
<i>It’s where my grandma left me
everything she’d saved.</i>

29:08.539 --> 29:10.207
<i>All the memories...</i>

29:12.626 --> 29:14.879
<i>and all the recordings she’d made.</i>

29:17.506 --> 29:19.424
<i>Her receipts from her life,</i>

29:19.425 --> 29:21.844
<i>and from a long time before, too.</i>

29:32.813 --> 29:34.940
<i>I can feel people all around me.</i>

29:37.860 --> 29:39.487
<i>My parents are here...</i>

29:42.198 --> 29:43.991
<i>and my grandma too.</i>

29:46.202 --> 29:48.454
<i>It’s our memory they want to wipe out,</i>

29:49.705 --> 29:52.291
<i>language, culture,</i>

29:52.875 --> 29:54.502
<i>and history.</i>

29:57.630 --> 29:59.465
<i>And people connecting,</i>

30:00.716 --> 30:02.468
<i>people protesting.</i>

30:07.264 --> 30:09.517
<i>This is why they came for Grandma.</i>

30:12.478 --> 30:14.230
<i>They said it’s wrong.</i>

30:16.690 --> 30:18.317
<i>They said it’s a crime.</i>

30:21.195 --> 30:23.697
<i>and I know one day
they’ll come for me, too.</i>

30:32.456 --> 30:34.416
<i>The event wasn’t just one thing.</i>

30:35.626 --> 30:37.419
<i>It was a slow creep.</i>

30:38.170 --> 30:40.548
<i>Places we used to visit got taken over,</i>

30:41.382 --> 30:43.424
<i>walls got built,</i>

30:43.425 --> 30:44.802
<i>access was denied.</i>

30:46.136 --> 30:48.263
<i>When you’re desperate,</i>

30:48.264 --> 30:49.932
<i>just surviving,</i>

30:50.599 --> 30:53.018
<i>you can’t see what’s been taken away.</i>

30:56.063 --> 30:57.648
<i>You can’t fight back.</i>

31:40.441 --> 31:44.277
<i>Illegal border
crossing is forbidden.</i>

31:44.278 --> 31:46.697
<i>You will face criminal charges.</i>

32:10.220 --> 32:13.765
<i>My grandma used to tell
me how when she was a girl,</i>

32:13.766 --> 32:16.268
<i>she played with other kids in the park.</i>

32:22.691 --> 32:25.319
<i>And one by one, they stopped showing up.</i>

32:28.572 --> 32:31.533
<i>Some of them got sucked into
screen images.</i>

32:34.453 --> 32:36.412
<i>Some of them got suicidal.</i>

32:40.292 --> 32:41.835
<i>Others vanished.</i>

33:54.908 --> 33:56.784
We are Uyghur people,

33:56.785 --> 33:58.996
historically from Central Asia.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.373
A Turkik Muslim group like Khazaks,

34:02.374 --> 34:04.500
and Uzbeks and Tatars.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.295
We are Sunni Muslim.

34:09.256 --> 34:13.342
The Chinese government always had this paranoia

34:13.343 --> 34:15.637
that the region is not safe.

34:16.054 --> 34:21.350
That Uyghurs always have
the desire to seek independence

34:21.351 --> 34:25.314
and therefore it must use every power

34:26.106 --> 34:29.276
to make sure it is completely controlled.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.236
You're looking at
the World Trade Centre,

34:32.237 --> 34:35.072
we understand that a plane has crashed

34:35.073 --> 34:36.240
into the World Trade Centre.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.285
We don’t know anything more than that.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.873
9/11, when Bush declared war against terror.

34:43.624 --> 34:46.459
The Chinese government conveniently said:

34:46.460 --> 34:49.171
"We also face the Muslim terrorists."

34:50.005 --> 34:52.424
Branding Uyghurs as terrorists.

35:01.600 --> 35:06.145
This was the escalation
to impose strict policies

35:06.146 --> 35:10.942
to make it legal to
arbitrarily detain and kill Uyghur people.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.703
Then this kind of high
tech surveillance started.

35:22.704 --> 35:23.914
Using cameras.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.083
Facial recognition.

35:30.003 --> 35:35.008
They set up a working
group to examine every person

35:35.384 --> 35:36.717
every family.

35:36.718 --> 35:39.679
To check who has travelled abroad,

35:39.680 --> 35:42.056
who ever signed a petition,

35:42.057 --> 35:44.393
ever protested for anything.

35:45.227 --> 35:48.729
They categorised the entire population

35:48.730 --> 35:50.190
as normal,

35:50.524 --> 35:51.525
suspicious,

35:51.817 --> 35:53.235
and untrustworthy.

35:57.364 --> 36:01.577
They built the biggest
reservoir of data ever collected.

36:09.668 --> 36:13.045
Every Uyghur aged over 12

36:13.046 --> 36:18.051
must go to the hospital
to provide a "health profile"

36:19.219 --> 36:20.012
DNA,

36:22.598 --> 36:23.473
fingerprints,

36:26.310 --> 36:27.227
iris scan,

36:33.191 --> 36:37.738
facial recognition from
various different sides of their face

36:38.322 --> 36:40.908
and also voice recognition.

36:43.535 --> 36:48.080
They had to read 20 times
one paragraph of a newspaper

36:48.081 --> 36:50.375
establishing bio data,

36:52.044 --> 36:56.714
and then the computer
can automatically give a result

36:56.715 --> 36:59.133
whether you are normal,

36:59.134 --> 37:01.594
you are suspicious

37:01.595 --> 37:03.305
or untrustworthy.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.895
The Uyghurs have many
of the same complaints

37:10.896 --> 37:12.104
as the Tibetans.

37:12.105 --> 37:14.106
They say they’re discriminated against,

37:14.107 --> 37:16.275
that they’re not allowed to
practise their religion

37:16.276 --> 37:17.653
and culture freely.

37:19.613 --> 37:22.991
And they’re afraid to speak
in public, especially now.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.659
One man said to me,

37:24.660 --> 37:25.993
“You talk today,

37:25.994 --> 37:28.705
and tomorrow
your whole family disappears.”

37:35.963 --> 37:37.004
Human rights campaigners say

37:37.005 --> 37:38.756
that over a million people

37:38.757 --> 37:40.633
have been interned in concentration camps

37:40.634 --> 37:43.303
in the far west province of Xinjiang.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.723
It’s probably the largest internment

37:47.724 --> 37:49.517
of an ethnic or religious minority

37:49.518 --> 37:51.353
since the Holocaust.

37:53.772 --> 37:58.693
Those who they believe,
potentially are untrustworthy.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.236
Not even dangerous,

38:00.237 --> 38:01.320
potentially

38:01.321 --> 38:04.866
have to go to these
so-called "re-education camps".

38:08.036 --> 38:10.288
they completely re-engineer them.

38:11.999 --> 38:15.460
So the Uyghur people were given two choices:

38:19.381 --> 38:22.134
You either become a Han Chinese person

38:24.469 --> 38:25.803
or

38:25.804 --> 38:27.014
you die.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.700
We’re on the precipice

38:47.701 --> 38:50.286
of probably the biggest revolution

38:50.287 --> 38:54.124
that the world has gone through
in modern times.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.960
China is the blueprint,

38:58.003 --> 39:00.881
because this technology is for sale.

39:20.192 --> 39:23.319
Israeli soldiers use
facial recognition software

39:23.320 --> 39:26.280
to take photos of Palestinians,

39:26.281 --> 39:31.536
in order to scan their faces
into this Wolf Pack database.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.705
It’s the latest component,
really, of a system of total

39:34.706 --> 39:37.584
surveillance of
the Palestinian population.

39:41.254 --> 39:44.048
Israel have found a way to control

39:44.049 --> 39:46.217
millions and millions of Palestinians

39:46.218 --> 39:48.177
through surveillance technology,

39:48.178 --> 39:50.972
through weapons, through drones.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.982
A myriad of surveillance and repression,

40:01.983 --> 40:04.610
and Israel says, if you want to
have good relations with us,

40:04.611 --> 40:06.362
we’ll sell you this amazing technology,

40:06.363 --> 40:09.698
so you can also surveil
your dissidents and critics.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.122
Technology's integrated into warfare,

40:16.123 --> 40:19.250
and there are algorithms that
help guide military strategy

40:19.251 --> 40:21.962
that offer death and destruction
among civilians.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.505
You’re removing people
from the decision-making,

40:24.506 --> 40:26.173
so you don’t even have any capacity

40:26.174 --> 40:28.050
to bring a perspective on whether or not

40:28.051 --> 40:30.845
we should drop a 2000-pound bomb
on a refugee camp.

41:07.007 --> 41:10.886
The way in which we communicate
and live is changing.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.514
The possibilities for what
people in positions

41:15.515 --> 41:16.974
of power can do,

41:16.975 --> 41:20.144
and the way that they can
intrude into our lives,

41:20.145 --> 41:23.148
into our relationships, has all changed.

41:23.732 --> 41:26.025
Because we have this
totalitarian architecture

41:26.026 --> 41:28.444
around us, you only need
a change of government,

41:28.445 --> 41:30.196
or change of circumstances,

41:30.197 --> 41:34.074
before it’s used in a totalitarian way,

41:34.075 --> 41:35.869
when it’s too late.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.600
<i>Names of
relatives and associates?</i>

42:02.938 --> 42:06.608
<i>What groups or organisations
do you connect with?</i>

42:11.529 --> 42:15.116
<i>Do you have contact with any
illegals in America?</i>

42:56.283 --> 42:59.118
<i>I believe there will be a clash</i>

42:59.119 --> 43:01.704
<i>between those who want freedom,</i>

43:01.705 --> 43:04.290
<i>justice and equality,</i>

43:04.291 --> 43:09.004
<i>and those who want systems
of exploitation.</i>

43:17.804 --> 43:18.972
Do you have a teapot?

43:26.229 --> 43:27.314
Do you mind?

43:56.718 --> 43:58.094
Water?

44:25.330 --> 44:26.998
Greek mountain tea.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.877
My secret store.

44:34.964 --> 44:36.341
Hmm.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.053
I’m surprised it still has any scent left.

44:42.972 --> 44:44.723
Perhaps there’s still someone out there

44:44.724 --> 44:46.893
collecting it from the hills.

44:51.606 --> 44:54.442
Perhaps there’s still hills out there.

44:56.319 --> 44:59.071
Perhaps there’s a Greece,

44:59.072 --> 45:02.116
a Japan...

45:02.117 --> 45:04.244
if they’re not both under the sea.

45:10.125 --> 45:11.417
Hmm.

45:15.422 --> 45:18.675
"There is no better teacher
than adversity."

45:20.343 --> 45:25.013
Every defeat, every heartbreak,

45:25.014 --> 45:29.519
every loss contains its own seed.

45:33.189 --> 45:36.024
They killed the guy that
said it, but it’s still true.

45:38.570 --> 45:40.697
Hmm, that’s right.

45:43.616 --> 45:45.577
Somebody has to win.

46:15.148 --> 46:18.192
<i>She used to be
a professor of history,</i>

46:18.193 --> 46:20.194
<i>until AI decided what she taught</i>

46:20.195 --> 46:22.530
<i>was obscene and criminal.</i>

46:22.906 --> 46:25.283
<i>That’s when she came down
to live with us.</i>

46:25.992 --> 46:28.160
<i>This was the last time I saw her,</i>

46:28.161 --> 46:30.121
<i>she vanished soon after.</i>

46:31.206 --> 46:33.166
<i>Happens all the time.</i>

46:35.043 --> 46:38.170
<i>That’s how I know she was a true friend,</i>

46:38.171 --> 46:40.507
<i>someone I could trust.</i>

46:42.634 --> 46:46.429
<i>But it’s too late now, she’s gone.</i>

46:54.479 --> 46:55.646
Welcome.

46:58.358 --> 46:59.191
Wow.

46:59.192 --> 47:00.735
You purchased Twitter with...

47:01.152 --> 47:03.613
...to do something for charity.

47:04.405 --> 47:07.742
There’s a new set of kings
that nobody voted for,

47:08.284 --> 47:10.494
and they have more money and power

47:10.495 --> 47:12.705
than any corporation ever has.

47:13.206 --> 47:14.289
Tesla boss, Elon Musk,

47:14.290 --> 47:16.166
is now the richest person in the world,

47:16.167 --> 47:20.629
with a net worth of $185 billion.

47:20.630 --> 47:22.839
Facebook’s got
$46 billion in cash.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.634
The cashflow’s somewhere
around $10.5/11 billion.

47:25.635 --> 47:27.928
Google’s parent
company, Alphabet, surged,

47:27.929 --> 47:31.932
for the full year revenue
rose to nearly $75 billion.

47:31.933 --> 47:33.016
That now makes Alphabet

47:33.017 --> 47:34.810
the world’s most valuable company,

47:34.811 --> 47:35.978
ahead of Apple.

47:35.979 --> 47:37.021
I just want to jump in with

47:37.021 --> 47:38.188
some Amazon numbers:

47:38.189 --> 47:40.567
revenue, $89 billion.

47:41.401 --> 47:43.527
They are powerful not simply because

47:43.528 --> 47:45.445
they have all the money and the wealth,

47:45.446 --> 47:47.823
but because they’ve amassed
all of the information.

47:47.824 --> 47:50.576
Age, gender, ethnicity, religion,

47:50.577 --> 47:51.618
what car you drive,

47:51.619 --> 47:53.453
what products you purchase in shops,

47:53.454 --> 47:54.871
what churches you attend,

47:54.872 --> 47:57.541
how you see the world,
what actually drives you.

47:57.542 --> 47:59.543
How open you are to new experiences,

47:59.544 --> 48:01.336
whether you prefer order and habits

48:01.337 --> 48:03.672
and planning in your life,
how social you are,

48:03.673 --> 48:05.090
how much you tend to worry.

48:05.091 --> 48:08.260
Big data is an understanding
of your personality,

48:08.261 --> 48:11.054
because it’s personality that
drives behaviour,

48:11.055 --> 48:14.100
and behaviour obviously
influences how you vote.

48:16.185 --> 48:17.853
These technology companies

48:17.854 --> 48:21.106
have become behaviour-
modification systems

48:21.107 --> 48:25.152
for sale to the highest bidder.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.241
We are worth more when we are dead slabs

48:31.242 --> 48:33.285
of predictable human behaviour,

48:33.286 --> 48:35.871
than when we are as living, breathing

48:35.872 --> 48:38.165
informed citizens of a democracy.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.000
We are worth more when we are addicted,

48:40.001 --> 48:43.670
outraged, distracted, polarised
and disinformed,

48:43.671 --> 48:45.797
than if we are living, breathing,

48:45.798 --> 48:47.925
free humans and citizens.

48:48.301 --> 48:51.512
Technology domesticates us
into the new kind of human.

48:54.349 --> 48:56.391
The last time human beings
were commodified,

48:56.392 --> 48:58.727
it was the age of industrialisation,

48:58.728 --> 49:00.228
and it was labour,

49:00.229 --> 49:02.731
and when labour was commodified,

49:02.732 --> 49:05.776
we had sweatshops, we had factory lines,

49:05.777 --> 49:07.194
we had child labour,

49:07.195 --> 49:13.033
we had exploitation
of our physical bodies.

49:13.034 --> 49:16.578
Now what’s commodified is not
our physical bodies,

49:16.579 --> 49:19.082
it’s our attention.

49:24.128 --> 49:26.381
So what are they going to do next?

49:35.139 --> 49:39.852
In 2017, a new AI engine got invented.

49:41.270 --> 49:44.147
These things are generative,
large language,

49:44.148 --> 49:46.401
multimodal models.

49:48.403 --> 49:52.990
These models treat absolutely
everything as language.

49:58.413 --> 50:02.750
Everything human beings do
runs on top of language:

50:03.251 --> 50:04.377
our laws,

50:06.462 --> 50:08.423
the idea of a nation state,

50:09.048 --> 50:10.883
friendships and relationships.

50:11.592 --> 50:14.886
And just like AI can now transit
between human languages,

50:14.887 --> 50:17.432
you can translate between almost anything.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.393
Images can be treated as language.

50:20.810 --> 50:22.811
Sound becomes a language.

50:22.812 --> 50:25.189
DNA is just another kind of language.

50:25.356 --> 50:29.527
This becomes the total decoding
and synthesising of reality.

50:32.613 --> 50:34.823
These models are so sophisticated

50:34.824 --> 50:36.908
that they can actually
autonomously generate

50:36.909 --> 50:41.663
anything that you might think
is unique to human creativity,

50:41.664 --> 50:43.791
or human intelligence.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.343
It is a massive cybersecurity issue,

50:55.344 --> 50:56.928
it’s a national security issue.

50:56.929 --> 51:01.767
It is a potent threat for
geopolitics, election hacking,

51:01.768 --> 51:04.896
because anybody’s identity can
be assumed and appropriated.

51:10.485 --> 51:12.694
There’s absolutely no guard rails,

51:12.695 --> 51:14.070
no laws,

51:14.071 --> 51:17.699
nothing that prevents
the tech from gambling on this

51:17.700 --> 51:19.451
without any consequences.

51:19.452 --> 51:22.996
The longer nation states do not
use their power

51:22.997 --> 51:25.457
to regulate artificial intelligence,

51:25.458 --> 51:28.043
the more data and power it gets,

51:28.044 --> 51:32.256
which usurps the powers of nation states.

51:32.423 --> 51:36.134
This is right up front,
changing our lives.

51:43.935 --> 51:46.394
Every worker has a scanner at all times

51:46.395 --> 51:48.981
that basically tracks
exactly where you’re at.

51:49.607 --> 51:51.066
What they’re doing is they’re producing

51:51.067 --> 51:53.443
this massive data that they are using

51:53.444 --> 51:56.447
to be able to analyse
the entire workforce.

52:00.243 --> 52:02.035
We’re not treated as human beings,

52:02.036 --> 52:04.246
we’re not even treated as robots.

52:04.247 --> 52:06.624
We’re treated as part of the data stream.

52:10.336 --> 52:12.796
We are now solving problems
with machine learning

52:12.797 --> 52:14.506
and artificial intelligence

52:14.507 --> 52:16.466
that were in the realm of science fiction

52:16.467 --> 52:18.719
for the last several decades.

52:21.556 --> 52:25.350
There will come a point where
no job is needed,

52:25.351 --> 52:27.812
the AI will be able to do everything.

52:31.816 --> 52:34.192
So how do we build a society

52:34.193 --> 52:37.654
where it’s not just the owners
of all the machines,

52:37.655 --> 52:39.323
and they own all the wealth,

52:40.157 --> 52:43.035
and then all the rest of us
are kind of serfs?

52:49.667 --> 52:53.545
The wealthy getting wealthier,
the poorer getting poorer,

52:53.546 --> 52:55.714
AI will exacerbate that,

52:55.715 --> 52:59.467
and that, I think,
will tear society apart,

52:59.468 --> 53:02.512
because the rich will have just too much,

53:02.513 --> 53:06.516
and those who are have nots
will have very little way

53:06.517 --> 53:09.061
of digging themselves
out of the hole.

53:13.482 --> 53:16.234
What we’re looking at
is a paradigm change

53:16.235 --> 53:19.822
in human communication,
even human evolution.

53:20.531 --> 53:24.785
The key question is,
who controls the machines?

53:25.286 --> 53:27.120
I am the reason OpenAI exists.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.706
Perhaps the most important
foundational technology

53:29.707 --> 53:32.084
of our time,
artificial intelligence.

53:32.251 --> 53:35.170
Basically, there’s no
institution in the world

53:35.171 --> 53:37.298
that cannot be improved
with machine learning.

53:44.305 --> 53:46.848
If we continue giving our money

53:46.849 --> 53:50.602
to these technology corporations,

53:50.603 --> 53:53.063
these people will have
more power and wealth

53:53.064 --> 53:55.066
than the entire world.

53:55.399 --> 53:57.944
And that’s what the most
alarming thing is.

53:58.694 --> 54:02.781
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome on stage,

54:02.782 --> 54:05.159
Peter Thiel.

54:09.246 --> 54:11.206
From a libertarian perspective,

54:11.207 --> 54:14.584
the western governments are not
working that well,

54:14.585 --> 54:16.252
there are all these things,

54:16.253 --> 54:18.213
they’re not very competent.

54:18.214 --> 54:19.381
Peter Thiel,

54:19.382 --> 54:23.426
the most influential venture capitalist
in Silicon Valley.

54:23.427 --> 54:24.511
And as a libertarian,

54:24.512 --> 54:27.722
I’m always sort of anti-government,
anti the state,

54:27.723 --> 54:30.308
but there’s also been
an extraordinary decline of

54:30.309 --> 54:32.894
competence of the US government.

54:32.895 --> 54:34.479
He is ultra-libertarian.

54:34.480 --> 54:37.774
I mean, it’s like a real bring
down the system ethos.

54:37.775 --> 54:40.276
Our system only works with growth.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.821
If you try to have a zero growth society,

54:42.822 --> 54:45.782
it would represent a tremendous
break from our past.

54:45.783 --> 54:48.368
Billionaires should
be allowed to pay less in taxes.

54:48.369 --> 54:51.079
Businesses should be allowed
increasing freedom,

54:51.080 --> 54:52.372
you know, bordering on the freedom

54:52.373 --> 54:54.834
to kind of run the world.

54:55.126 --> 54:57.711
Corporations are underrated,

54:57.712 --> 55:00.463
because so many of these
other institutions do not work.

55:00.464 --> 55:02.966
It’s one of the things
that’s endlessly frustrating

55:02.967 --> 55:06.803
to a lot of the very successful
people in Silicon Valley.

55:06.804 --> 55:08.263
He’s not just this
singular figure,

55:08.264 --> 55:11.017
he’s somebody whose ideas
have proliferated.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.977
Following Thiel is sort of this path

55:13.978 --> 55:16.105
through the history of Silicon Valley.

55:18.566 --> 55:20.066
It’s obviously very dysfunctional

55:20.067 --> 55:22.027
to have mass homelessness,

55:22.028 --> 55:25.280
it’s very dysfunctional
to have no law and order.

55:25.281 --> 55:28.450
But if you think of it as
a sort of inefficient

55:28.451 --> 55:30.493
redistributionist strategy,

55:30.494 --> 55:33.705
there’s a lot of it that has
a certain weird perverse logic.

55:33.706 --> 55:36.750
In San Francisco,
where I lived for 15 years,

55:36.751 --> 55:39.294
the homeless people
were in the lower parts of town.

55:39.295 --> 55:41.505
They didn’t climb up the hills.

55:41.630 --> 55:44.716
The value of the houses
on the hills went up way more

55:44.717 --> 55:48.136
than the value of the houses
on the flat parts went down.

55:48.137 --> 55:51.431
And so you have to think of
the homeless people as like

55:51.432 --> 55:53.767
this feature to increase the value

55:53.768 --> 55:55.810
of the higher-end real estate in the city.

55:58.147 --> 56:02.067
Peter Thiel owns this company, Palantir,

56:02.068 --> 56:04.945
a Silicon Valley big data company,

56:07.323 --> 56:10.742
which has got its claws
into the British government,

56:10.743 --> 56:14.412
and it’s infiltrating itself into the NHS.

56:14.413 --> 56:16.331
Concordance wants to fix

56:16.332 --> 56:19.043
the fragmented healthcare supply chain.

56:19.794 --> 56:23.296
This new health service will be
organised on a national scale,

56:23.297 --> 56:24.881
as a public responsibility.

56:24.882 --> 56:26.716
And so everyone will pay for it,

56:26.717 --> 56:28.843
and everyone will benefit from it.

56:28.844 --> 56:31.179
When you’re ill, you won’t have
to pay for it.

56:31.180 --> 56:33.056
What we have in the NHS

56:33.057 --> 56:37.268
is an entire nation’s medical history,

56:37.269 --> 56:39.771
from cradle to the grave.

56:39.772 --> 56:44.192
That is a vast data set,
at an individual level,

56:44.193 --> 56:46.821
and then at a nationwide level.

56:47.071 --> 56:51.783
So, if you want to do anything
with healthcare and big data,

56:51.784 --> 56:55.746
it is a massive asset.

56:56.705 --> 56:58.873
US tech firm,
Palantir Technologies,

56:58.874 --> 57:00.875
has won the biggest IT contract

57:00.876 --> 57:03.169
in the history of NHS England.

57:03.170 --> 57:06.256
The company have been awarded
a £330 million deal

57:06.257 --> 57:09.926
to provide AI software to bring
together the data of patients.

57:09.927 --> 57:12.011
It’s really, really important

57:12.012 --> 57:15.349
people are transparent with
what ultimately is our data.

57:15.724 --> 57:18.476
The first funding that Palantir ever got

57:18.477 --> 57:21.229
was actually the venture capital
arm of the CIA.

57:21.230 --> 57:24.315
And up until very recently,
all of its customers

57:24.316 --> 57:25.608
were the government.

57:25.609 --> 57:27.819
This includes the Department of Justice,

57:27.820 --> 57:28.987
Department of Defence,

57:28.988 --> 57:30.697
Department of Homeland Security,

57:30.698 --> 57:33.492
immigration, customs enforcement.

57:34.201 --> 57:36.244
The idea that a company like that,

57:36.245 --> 57:38.246
a company involved in surveillance,

57:38.247 --> 57:40.874
in counter-terrorism,
in border enforcement,

57:40.875 --> 57:43.918
has any place in the NHS is ridiculous.

57:43.919 --> 57:46.546
He’s ahead of the curve,
and I want to thank you,

57:46.547 --> 57:48.882
you’re a very special guy.

57:48.883 --> 57:51.259
Peter Thiel is a
perfect example

57:51.260 --> 57:54.888
of a libertarian tech bro,

57:54.889 --> 57:56.514
who believes that what we really need

57:56.515 --> 57:58.933
is to get away from
the reins of the state,

57:58.934 --> 58:01.853
and just set up some kind of
free-for-all system

58:01.854 --> 58:03.479
where the billionaire Übermensch

58:03.480 --> 58:07.567
can live unfettered by other people.

58:07.568 --> 58:09.319
We have to save this planet,

58:09.320 --> 58:11.362
and we shouldn’t give up a future

58:11.363 --> 58:13.698
for our grandchildren’s
grandchildren, of dynamism

58:13.699 --> 58:15.450
and growth - we can have both.

58:15.451 --> 58:16.952
Manufactured worlds,

58:17.119 --> 58:21.581
rotated to create artificial
gravity with centrifugal force.

58:21.582 --> 58:25.293
These are very large structures,
miles on end,

58:25.294 --> 58:27.922
and they hold a million people
or more each.

58:29.340 --> 58:33.176
High-speed transport, agricultural areas.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.220
Some of them would be more recreational.

58:35.221 --> 58:37.889
You could have a recreational one
that keeps a zero G,

58:37.890 --> 58:39.349
so that you can go flying.

58:39.350 --> 58:41.100
These are ideal climates,

58:41.101 --> 58:42.852
these are shirt-sleeve environments.

58:42.853 --> 58:45.189
People are going to want to live here.

58:46.148 --> 58:48.942
Techno-libertarians are really hoping for

58:48.943 --> 58:50.902
some kind of a techno-monarchy,

58:50.903 --> 58:54.239
where this group of elite tech bros

58:54.240 --> 58:56.324
creates the blockchain and the algorithms

58:56.325 --> 58:58.326
that automate our reality

58:58.327 --> 59:02.497
under their benevolent programming,
God-like wisdom.

59:15.886 --> 59:18.513
It’s survival
of the richest,

59:18.514 --> 59:21.474
because they’re preparing for
a civilisation threatening

59:21.475 --> 59:26.354
catastrophe in their lifetime, the event,

59:26.355 --> 59:28.481
the thermonuclear war,

59:28.482 --> 59:30.233
the electromagnetic pulse,

59:30.234 --> 59:33.528
the climate catastrophe, the pandemic,

59:33.529 --> 59:36.322
the economic revolution,

59:36.323 --> 59:40.619
whatever it is that makes life
for them unliveable.

59:41.996 --> 59:43.997
So, they’re running around
trying to make toys

59:43.998 --> 59:46.708
that somehow fix things,

59:46.709 --> 59:49.211
like underground bunkers,

59:52.006 --> 59:54.049
and rocket ships.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.308
I want to thank every Amazon employee

01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:05.268
and every Amazon customer,

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.354
because you guys paid for all of this.

01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:12.233
It’s always an
end justifies the means journey,

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:14.903
towards their better place.

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:22.994
And externalising a tremendous
amount of horror

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:27.540
onto whoever isn’t on board
their particular thesis.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.873
No, baby, oh no!

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:03.881
<i>Could this world and
my life have been different</i>

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:09.596
<i>if I’d have done something,
stood up, fought back?</i>

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:16.395
<i>What difference could I make on my own?</i>

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.721
They are taking our lands away

01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:53.640
to give it to the wolves.

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:58.687
Evangelicals are coming into our lands

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.692
to divide our people,

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.361
erase our culture

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.615
and now they want to take away our souls.

01:05:11.283 --> 01:05:13.869
I want to tell Bolsonaro:

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:17.121
Respect our life.

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:18.831
Respect our territory.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.458
Respect our rights.

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:22.919
Respect our ancestors.

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:25.881
We will not give up our lands.

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.009
Because we are here to fight.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.768
We’re running faster and faster
through the woods,

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:41.355
increasingly blind, with less
steering and control.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.569
Things are going faster
and faster and faster.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.615
We no longer have a grip on time itself.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.283
There are geological natural changes,

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:55.368
there are social changes

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:57.119
and there are technological changes,

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.582
and I think mostly we don’t feel
that we’re in the driving seat.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.919
We feel that these forces are driving us.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:11.051
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.014
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.141
Oh my God.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.311
My God.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:27.859
My God, please stop, please! Oh my God.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:31.071
Oh my God! Please, please!

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.534
Please get me out of here. Please.

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:37.785
Please.

01:06:37.786 --> 01:06:40.247
Oh. Oh.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.457
Oh my God.

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:20.286
We have known for quite some time

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:23.914
that climate change acts
as a threat multiplier

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:25.833
for all dimensions of society,

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:29.212
and now we have our world on fire.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:36.094
We’re losing lives. We’ve got
infrastructure buckling.

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:41.183
We should be accelerating into
the energy transition now.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:52.026
We are truly in a climate emergency.

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:55.154
It’s here and now, it’s not in the future.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:02.703
We have faced a lot of bad stuff
in the past,

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.830
wars and famines and genocides,

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.959
but this is bigger than any of that.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.670
If we allow dictators,

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:15.509
billionaires and private
corporations much more power,

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:21.306
they will allow the planetary
scale trashing of ecosystems.

01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:26.645
And we will see the collapse of
almost all life on earth.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.898
Our duty, as people who care
about other people,

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:33.234
is to oppose those who don't
care about anyone

01:08:33.235 --> 01:08:35.402
except themselves.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:39.698
Because if we do nothing,
we face mass extinction.

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:06.685
Get out!

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:57.105
<i>This is it.</i>

01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:59.566
<i>they’ve come for me.</i>

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.903
<i>It’s my turn.</i>

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:29.971
<i>Name?</i>

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:37.270
<i>Where were you born?</i>

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:49.032
<i>Where in New San Francisco
have you visited?</i>

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:56.206
<i>Names of relatives and associates?</i>

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:09.511
<i>What groups or organisations
do you connect with?</i>

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.449
<i>What is two plus two?</i>

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:50.176
<i>Which books have you read?</i>

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.855
<i>Have you ever participated in a protest?</i>

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.195
<i>Do you pray?</i>

01:14:19.581 --> 01:14:22.542
<i>Would you like to self-confess
your crimes?</i>

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:57.951
I really feel like we’re already living

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.287
in a science fiction world,

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:04.958
and in this world,
individual will is gone.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:07.921
That’s the reality
we’re already living in.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.328
This year, 72 percent of the world

01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.498
is under authoritarian rule.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:48.126
They crush democratic
institutions from within.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.337
They don’t stay in their countries.

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:52.214
They then ally globally,

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.968
and that’s where we begin to see
the power shifts.

01:15:56.928 --> 01:15:58.972
Time is ticking.

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:04.727
If we do not act when we can,
we will lose free will.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.397
That’s the tipping point.

01:16:08.106 --> 01:16:10.900
Are we going to fall off the cliff?

01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:14.195
Will democracy survive, will fascism win?

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:18.832
<i>Welcome to
your de-extremification</i>

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.918
<i>and re-education.</i>

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:28.509
<i>Do you have contact with any
illegals in the Americas?</i>

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.350
<i>Have you ever signed a petition?</i>

01:21:42.023 --> 01:21:44.609
<i>What are your religious practices?</i>

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:53.284
<i>Who are your contacts abroad?</i>

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:02.043
<i>What has changed in your mind?</i>

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:10.426
<i>Where is your tracking device?</i>

01:22:16.307 --> 01:22:18.058
<i>Do you have contact with anyone</i>

01:22:18.059 --> 01:22:19.852
<i>who has been re-educated?</i>

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.195
<i>What are you going to do
when you are released?</i>

01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:38.037
<i>What is two plus two?</i>

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.378
<i>The answer is five.</i>

01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:48.381
<i>What is two plus two?</i>

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:54.011
<i>Incorrect.</i>

01:22:57.515 --> 01:22:59.725
<i>What is two plus two?</i>
