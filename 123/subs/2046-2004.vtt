02:10.287 --> 02:14.963
In the year 2046, a vast
rail network spans the globe

02:16.087 --> 02:20.558
A mysterious train leaves
for 2046 every once in a while

02:21.967 --> 02:25.562
Every passenger going to
2046 has the same intention

02:26.207 --> 02:28.675
They want to recapture lost
memories

02:29.367 --> 02:33.485
Because nothing ever changes
in 2046

02:34.607 --> 02:36.563
Nobody really knows if
that's true

02:36.887 --> 02:39.720
Because nobody's ever come back

02:40.487 --> 02:42.318
Except me

02:45.887 --> 02:48.765
998.

02:51.447 --> 02:53.961
997.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.284
I f someone wants to I eave 2046...

02:58.207 --> 03:00.277
...how long will it take?

03:01.327 --> 03:03.283
Some people get away
fairly easily

03:04.687 --> 03:08.123
Others find that it takes
them much longer

03:09.367 --> 03:12.518
I forget how long I've been
on this train

03:13.767 --> 03:16.281
I'm starting to feel very lonely

03:21.207 --> 03:24.643
As I recall
many have gone to 2046

03:25.367 --> 03:27.756
You're the first to come back

03:29.967 --> 03:33.676
May I ask why you left 2046?

03:39.767 --> 03:42.804
Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046...

03:43.287 --> 03:46.518
...I gave them some vague answer

03:50.367 --> 03:51.846
Before...

03:52.527 --> 03:55.360
...when people had secrets
they didn't want to share

03:55.727 --> 03:57.843
...they'd climb a mountain

03:58.367 --> 04:01.086
They'd find a tree
and carve a hole in it

04:03.687 --> 04:06.121
And whisper the secret into the hole

04:07.487 --> 04:09.762
Then cover it over with mud

04:12.807 --> 04:18.325
That way. nobody else would
ever discover it

04:20.327 --> 04:22.124
I once fell in love with someone

04:24.287 --> 04:26.403
After a while. she wasn't there

04:28.527 --> 04:30.165
I went to 2046

04:31.607 --> 04:35.236
I thought she might be waiting
for me there

04:37.447 --> 04:39.642
But I couldn't find her

04:43.207 --> 04:47.200
I can't stop wondering if
she loved me or not

04:50.007 --> 04:52.999
But I never found out

04:54.647 --> 04:57.480
Maybe her answer was
like a secret...

04:58.647 --> 05:01.844
that no one else would ever know

05:04.007 --> 05:08.398
All memories are traces of tears

05:25.407 --> 05:27.477
Didn't you promise not to
come back?

05:29.367 --> 05:30.561
I came to see you

05:34.167 --> 05:35.316
Why?

05:37.647 --> 05:39.399
I have no prospects here

05:39.847 --> 05:42.884
So I'll see how things are
in Hong Kong

05:49.047 --> 05:50.480
When are you leaving?

05:52.487 --> 05:54.443
The boat sails in two days

06:02.607 --> 06:04.245
Why are you telling me?

06:14.407 --> 06:16.284
I thought we might go together

06:27.607 --> 06:29.598
You know nothing about my past
do you?

06:34.927 --> 06:36.838
If you'd rather not tell me
I don't mind

06:52.847 --> 06:54.405
If you win. I'll join you

07:31.287 --> 07:33.357
She found an indirect way
of rejecting me

07:34.567 --> 07:35.682
As I recall...

07:36.367 --> 07:38.198
...that was the very last time
we saw each other

07:39.247 --> 07:41.556
Right after that
I left Singapore

08:06.527 --> 08:08.404
I got back to Hong Kong
at the end of 1966

08:09.247 --> 08:10.965
Because of the price raise
of ferry ticket

08:11.207 --> 08:12.401
There was riots in Kowloon

08:13.847 --> 08:15.439
I wasn't sure how long
I'd be staying...

08:16.087 --> 08:18.362
So I took a room in a small
hotel in Wanchai

08:18.567 --> 08:20.319
I wrote columns for the Newspapers

08:21.767 --> 08:23.758
They paid HK$10 per thousand words

08:24.807 --> 08:26.877
I t was pretty tough at first

08:42.447 --> 08:43.674
As long as I could make ends meet

08:44.246 --> 08:47.683
...it made no difference what
kind of stuff I wrote

08:48.367 --> 08:49.595
"Diary of the Bazooka Hero"

08:51.447 --> 08:52.641
"The new star at
Club Luk Kwok is Fei Fei!"

08:53.287 --> 08:55.278
"A knockout beauty with
amazing bazookas!"

08:56.167 --> 08:57.725
"A smash hit with tit-lovers!"

08:59.207 --> 09:01.596
Hang on. of course I exaggerate

09:01.927 --> 09:03.599
I can't say her tits are fake
can I?

09:12.607 --> 09:15.075
I soon got used to
this kind of life

09:15.647 --> 09:17.000
I became an expert ladies' man

09:18.047 --> 09:19.924
Lots of one-night-stands

09:20.527 --> 09:23.564
But nothing lasts forever anyway

09:40.047 --> 09:43.881
24 December 1966

09:50.687 --> 09:52.439
Is that really true?

09:53.567 --> 09:55.080
Why would I lie to you?

09:55.967 --> 09:57.764
You really know me?

09:58.647 --> 10:00.478
Weren't you in a show in
Singapore in ' 64?

10:01.647 --> 10:02.557
Yes

10:03.007 --> 10:04.360
You' re Lu I u

10:17.207 --> 10:18.276
I was then

10:19.007 --> 10:20.360
Not any more

10:21.127 --> 10:22.480
What's your name now?

10:25.967 --> 10:27.400
Why should I tell you?

10:29.847 --> 10:31.166
On Christmas Eve 1966...

10:32.047 --> 10:35.164
...I ran into a friend from
Singapore in a night club

10:35.967 --> 10:37.320
We'd been rather close

10:37.887 --> 10:38.763
But that night...

10:39.487 --> 10:40.806
...she'd apparent I y forgotten me

10:45.887 --> 10:47.479
Have we really met before?

10:50.287 --> 10:51.845
How could you forget?

10:53.367 --> 10:55.597
You said I looked like
your late boyfriend

10:55.847 --> 10:57.883
You taught me the cha-cha

11:09.327 --> 11:10.646
Go on...

11:17.367 --> 11:19.244
You were always dragging
me to the casino

11:20.727 --> 11:22.080
You'd hit a losing streak

11:23.047 --> 11:24.241
You owed a fortune

11:25.767 --> 11:27.997
My friends and I paid
for your passage to Hong Kong

11:30.847 --> 11:32.997
You talked a lot about
your late boyfriend

11:34.407 --> 11:38.400
A Chinese Filipino from
a rich family

11:40.087 --> 11:41.486
You planned to marry him

11:42.487 --> 11:43.715
But he died young

11:45.567 --> 11:47.398
You said he was the
love of your life

11:51.167 --> 11:52.282
I shouldn't bring
back sad memories...

11:54.967 --> 11:56.286
...at this time of year

11:58.207 --> 11:59.879
But do you remember
that Christmas night...

12:00.687 --> 12:02.245
...we went drinking?

12:17.007 --> 12:18.565
We talked a lot

12:20.327 --> 12:23.046
Was she just pretending
she'd forgotten me?

12:25.527 --> 12:28.166
I took her back to her hotel
She was dead to the world

12:47.967 --> 12:49.639
She'd had too much to drink...

12:50.167 --> 12:51.725
...so I left quickly

13:22.487 --> 13:25.638
On my way out. I noticed a
very familiar number

13:28.567 --> 13:32.480
If I hadn't run into her that night
I wouldn't have seen that number

13:32.967 --> 13:35.800
...and I wouldn't have written '2046'

13:46.767 --> 13:48.246
Can I help you?

13:48.687 --> 13:50.200
Is Miss Lulu in?

13:50.447 --> 13:53.519
Lulu? There's no Miss Lulu here

13:53.887 --> 13:55.206
There was a Mimi...

13:55.567 --> 13:56.841
...but she's moved out

13:58.367 --> 14:00.403
But I was here two days ago!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.565
Do you know where she's gone?

14:03.207 --> 14:05.596
No! What do you want with her?

14:06.127 --> 14:07.003
Nothing. really

14:08.687 --> 14:10.086
I have her key

14:10.327 --> 14:11.442
I wanted to return it

14:11.687 --> 14:13.120
You can give it to me

14:13.887 --> 14:14.842
Thanks

14:20.207 --> 14:21.435
You want to rent the room?

14:22.687 --> 14:23.676
I'm just back from abroad

14:24.007 --> 14:25.122
I don't have my own place yet

14:25.567 --> 14:27.125
If the room's vacant
I could take a look

14:27.767 --> 14:29.439
This is just a small hotel

14:30.047 --> 14:32.561
But our residents are
all decent people

14:33.487 --> 14:35.079
What's your line of work?

14:35.367 --> 14:36.561
I write for newspapers

14:36.887 --> 14:39.924
Great! A fellow artist!

14:42.207 --> 14:43.560
I haven't always done this

14:44.127 --> 14:46.197
I used to be an artist too

14:46.767 --> 14:47.677
Really?

14:47.967 --> 14:50.276
I took singing lessons
in Harbin

14:50.807 --> 14:52.843
Back then. I was a tenor

14:53.847 --> 14:56.315
It'll be a pleasure to
have you here

14:56.807 --> 14:57.956
When will you move in?

14:58.647 --> 14:59.762
As soon as possible

15:01.727 --> 15:03.080
But...

15:03.327 --> 15:05.158
2046 has to be redecorated

15:05.447 --> 15:06.960
2047 is vacant

15:07.247 --> 15:08.566
Take a look at it

15:16.927 --> 15:18.280
Never mind

15:18.487 --> 15:19.886
I'll come back when it's ready

15:21.367 --> 15:22.959
Why that particular room?

15:24.807 --> 15:26.320
Maybe it's the number

15:27.047 --> 15:29.197
It has some significance for you?

15:29.487 --> 15:30.886
I'm joking

15:31.527 --> 15:32.437
Tell you what...

15:33.127 --> 15:34.276
Take a quick look at 2047

15:34.687 --> 15:36.917
If it's okay. you can move in

15:37.367 --> 15:41.758
Then switch to 2046
when it's ready

15:42.007 --> 15:43.838
How about it?

15:46.167 --> 15:47.520
Can I see the room?

15:48.047 --> 15:49.765
Of course! Please...

16:07.487 --> 16:08.715
Once I moved in...

16:09.767 --> 16:10.677
...I found out what had
happened the night before

16:11.487 --> 16:13.796
Lulu was stabbed by a
jealous boyfriend

16:15.967 --> 16:17.525
A drummer from the club

16:18.527 --> 16:19.562
She'd really liked him...

16:21.007 --> 16:23.237
...and compared him with a
bird that could never land

16:24.527 --> 16:25.562
For all these years...

16:26.287 --> 16:29.245
She has been looking
for her legless bird'

16:30.407 --> 16:31.840
Most of her affairs ended badly

16:32.887 --> 16:34.366
But she didn't mind sad endings

16:35.847 --> 16:36.723
No matter what happened...

16:37.727 --> 16:39.718
...at least she was
always the leading lady

17:28.567 --> 17:29.886
Good!

17:30.327 --> 17:31.919
Sure!

17:33.247 --> 17:34.646
Go!

17:36.407 --> 17:37.806
Let's go!

17:39.967 --> 17:41.559
Let's go!

17:42.087 --> 17:43.566
I'll go with you!

17:44.527 --> 17:46.119
Good. I'll go with you!

17:46.727 --> 17:48.206
Sure!

17:50.367 --> 17:52.164
I understand!

17:54.007 --> 17:57.682
You know what I mean?
I know... I understand

17:59.247 --> 18:00.919
I got it!

18:03.967 --> 18:06.845
Can I go?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.043
I can go!

18:10.327 --> 18:11.680
Sure!

18:13.007 --> 18:14.679
I understand!

18:15.367 --> 18:17.835
Got it!

18:23.007 --> 18:25.567
It didn't take long to
finish redecorating 2046

18:27.007 --> 18:28.963
But by then I was used to 2047

18:31.207 --> 18:32.162
Sure!

18:32.447 --> 18:34.085
I started hearing a strange
voice through the wall

18:34.967 --> 18:36.446
I thought someone had moved in

18:37.807 --> 18:39.399
But it was the daughter of
the hotel owner. Mr. Wang

18:43.087 --> 18:43.997
Definitely!

18:45.007 --> 18:46.326
I'm definitely going!

18:48.087 --> 18:51.284
Okay. let's go!

19:09.727 --> 19:11.319
I had no idea what she was saying

19:15.287 --> 19:17.517
The bell-hop told
me it was Japanese

19:20.327 --> 19:22.761
It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend

19:24.687 --> 19:27.520
Tell the driver "220 Granville Road"

19:28.287 --> 19:29.686
Ga... ran... wai....
220 Granville Road

19:29.927 --> 19:35.320
Turn from Humphreys Avenue
near to Kimberley Road

19:35.527 --> 19:36.596
Can you say again?

19:36.847 --> 19:38.166
Don't turn down Salisbury
Road Slowly. please...

19:38.527 --> 19:39.403
I'll draw you a map

19:39.647 --> 19:40.636
That's my pen!

19:40.927 --> 19:41.882
I'll repeat it once more

19:42.167 --> 19:43.646
Turn from Humphreys Avenue

19:43.967 --> 19:45.036
Near to Kimberley Road

19:45.447 --> 19:47.438
But don't turn down Salisbury Road

19:47.807 --> 19:48.717
Understand?

19:49.047 --> 19:50.366
I'll draw you a map

19:51.527 --> 19:52.721
Granville Road

19:53.407 --> 19:54.396
Turn from Humphreys Avenue

19:55.207 --> 19:56.606
Don't turn down Salisbury Road

19:58.767 --> 20:00.758
Remember
don't turn down Salisbury Road

20:10.287 --> 20:11.481
His company in Japan had
sent him to Hong Kong

20:13.527 --> 20:15.995
When he got here
he checked into this hotel

20:18.287 --> 20:19.606
The world is full of men!

20:20.247 --> 20:22.397
Why do you have
to choose a Japanese?

20:22.967 --> 20:24.195
Get rid of him!

20:24.567 --> 20:26.603
I will never meet him!

20:27.247 --> 20:28.362
You want my blessing?

20:29.327 --> 20:31.204
Not while I'm alive!

20:33.967 --> 20:35.241
It had been going on for ages

20:35.767 --> 20:36.802
Mr. Wang's family suffered
under the Japanese in the war

20:37.727 --> 20:38.796
So they had to break up

21:16.127 --> 21:18.561
Can you tell me what you feel?

21:24.247 --> 21:26.397
Do you like me?

21:29.367 --> 21:30.959
Or not?

21:35.927 --> 21:38.157
I'm scared to hear your answer

21:46.887 --> 21:49.037
But I have to ask anyway

22:11.887 --> 22:13.240
Leave with me

22:54.447 --> 22:56.244
Goodbye

23:15.007 --> 23:16.360
The man finally went back to Japan

23:18.887 --> 23:23.278
That's when Miss
Wang began talking to herself

23:51.527 --> 23:53.757
Hey. ask your boss to turn it a bit!

23:54.967 --> 23:57.845
Mr. Chow
you'd better ask him yourself

24:00.927 --> 24:02.076
Mr. Chow....

24:03.007 --> 24:04.122
Hasn't he left already?

24:04.327 --> 24:05.680
Why is he back?

24:05.927 --> 24:07.246
I will not see him!

24:07.887 --> 24:08.922
If you won't give him up...

24:09.607 --> 24:11.006
Get out! Go away with him!

24:13.927 --> 24:15.997
I assumed that Mr. Wang
played it so loud...

24:16.327 --> 24:17.885
...because he loved his opera

24:18.527 --> 24:21.564
Actually he didn't want anyone
to overhear the family row

25:16.367 --> 25:17.846
What are you doing?

25:28.607 --> 25:30.086
Come back for me when
you're a little older!

25:33.487 --> 25:34.442
I said. Wait till you grow up!

25:39.407 --> 25:40.806
I like it

25:42.727 --> 25:43.842
Mr. Wang thought about very little

25:44.407 --> 25:46.284
...but his two daughters

25:46.847 --> 25:47.677
The elder one was crazy
about her Japanese man

25:48.847 --> 25:50.041
The younger one was
precocious for her age

25:50.807 --> 25:52.843
She kept coming into
my room for drinks

25:53.407 --> 25:55.762
Then she ran off with some man

25:56.567 --> 25:59.127
Another drummer from a
club band. I heard

26:00.087 --> 26:03.204
After she left. her elder
sister got into trouble too

26:03.727 --> 26:04.876
Hey. have a word with
your boss for me

26:05.167 --> 26:06.077
I'm a bit late with the rent

26:06.567 --> 26:07.761
Anyway. he has my deposit

26:08.967 --> 26:10.923
Mr. Chow. tell him yourself

26:11.247 --> 26:12.396
He's in a foul mood these days

26:13.087 --> 26:14.042
What's eating him?

26:14.967 --> 26:15.922
First. one daughter ran away

26:16.607 --> 26:17.835
Now the other one's in hospital

26:18.327 --> 26:19.442
That's why he's so angry

26:19.687 --> 26:20.915
Why is she in hospital?

26:21.207 --> 26:22.959
He wouldn't say. he was
quite strange...

26:23.767 --> 26:25.200
Steer clear of him!

26:25.527 --> 26:26.562
So. that's it?

26:27.567 --> 26:28.682
Anyhow. give him my invitation

26:28.967 --> 26:30.082
It's my father's birthday banquet

26:30.567 --> 26:32.239
He can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe

26:35.327 --> 26:38.637
Later they imposed a
curfew in Hong Kong

26:39.687 --> 26:40.836
Home-made bombs caused panic

26:41.727 --> 26:43.638
The economy stopped dead

26:45.727 --> 26:47.126
I stopped going out

26:48.247 --> 26:49.600
Some thought I was a
reformed character

26:50.287 --> 26:51.925
Actually. I was writing

26:52.687 --> 26:54.325
A story called 2046

26:55.167 --> 26:56.680
All about men and women
looking for love...

26:57.327 --> 27:00.000
...risking everything to
get to a place called 2046

27:00.727 --> 27:01.716
What's that?

27:02.287 --> 27:04.323
Let's go to...

27:05.367 --> 27:06.561
2046.

27:06.927 --> 27:09.316
I made it as bizarre and erotic as
possible. without crossing the line

27:10.207 --> 27:11.401
The readers liked it

27:13.127 --> 27:16.403
Some didn't take to the
science-fiction angle

27:17.207 --> 27:18.276
But all '2046' meant to me was...

27:18.887 --> 27:20.605
...the number of a hotel room

27:24.407 --> 27:25.726
I made up the whole thing

27:26.247 --> 27:29.000
But some of my own experiences
found their way into it

29:53.487 --> 29:55.205
People I ran into in the normal
course of things...

29:55.647 --> 29:57.205
...turned up in my stories

29:57.607 --> 30:00.201
I felt more and more at ease
in my fictional world

30:10.647 --> 30:13.366
Around that time. Mr. Wang's
music got louder again

30:15.007 --> 30:15.996
More trouble with his two
daughters...

30:17.167 --> 30:19.283
But also because of the bad
state of the economy

30:19.527 --> 30:21.279
Allot of the rooms were empty

30:22.047 --> 30:24.641
Then in September
the rioting ended

30:25.127 --> 30:26.958
Life went back to normal

30:34.327 --> 30:37.399
Soon. someone moved into 2046

30:45.447 --> 30:46.766
Have you nearly finished?

30:47.327 --> 30:48.760
It's too early in the day for that!

30:49.447 --> 30:51.278
Some of us are trying to sleep!

31:49.327 --> 31:50.760
Peeking?

31:51.447 --> 31:52.641
The woman next door is quite a dish!

31:52.927 --> 31:53.962
What are my chances?

31:54.327 --> 31:55.316
You're off your head!

31:55.767 --> 31:57.519
A father-to-be shouldn't have
that on his mind!

31:58.087 --> 31:59.236
Now she's pregnant

31:59.487 --> 32:00.522
My wife won't let me touch her!

32:01.127 --> 32:02.446
Come on

32:05.687 --> 32:06.278
Put in a word for me

32:06.967 --> 32:08.036
Okay...

32:08.847 --> 32:09.882
How much?

32:10.727 --> 32:12.206
How much have you got?

32:13.807 --> 32:15.035
Only $100...

32:15.287 --> 32:16.163
Wait for my call

32:16.367 --> 32:17.925
Mr. Chow!

32:18.127 --> 32:21.676
Mr. Chow. a call for you!

32:22.047 --> 32:23.036
Bright and early. huh?

32:24.127 --> 32:25.321
She's not up yet

32:27.687 --> 32:28.756
Why come over?

32:29.127 --> 32:30.355
I told you
It has to be arranged

32:30.607 --> 32:33.804
She's not some streetwalker!

32:35.687 --> 32:37.279
A fellow artist like you

32:37.567 --> 32:38.886
Show her a little respect
will you?

32:40.647 --> 32:42.638
Yes. I'll tell you right away!

32:44.687 --> 32:46.086
Miss Bai. your key

32:47.767 --> 32:49.120
You're back. Miss Bai

33:02.647 --> 33:03.966
Who is it?

33:04.247 --> 33:04.963
Who are you looking for?

33:05.207 --> 33:06.720
Mr. Chow suggested I come by...

33:08.327 --> 33:09.362
You're back. Mr. Chow

33:10.487 --> 33:11.840
Did you win on the dogs?

33:12.247 --> 33:14.397
I lost! I won a little

33:36.727 --> 33:37.842
Looking for me?

33:42.887 --> 33:44.923
I think you know this person?

33:47.087 --> 33:48.202
What are doing in that room?

33:48.447 --> 33:51.359
You said you'd arrange it!
I paid you!

33:51.607 --> 33:52.881
When did I say it was this room?

33:53.127 --> 33:55.083
I said that room
I said this one

33:55.287 --> 33:57.005
Your girl's in that room

33:57.767 --> 33:58.882
How embarrassing!
Please excuse him

33:59.647 --> 34:01.603
I told you. the room on the left!

34:01.887 --> 34:03.605
I said I wanted that one!
Shut up!

34:06.007 --> 34:06.757
Who is it?

34:13.047 --> 34:14.161
Oh. you again!

34:14.927 --> 34:17.998
I just wanted to apologize
for last night

34:18.527 --> 34:19.676
Forget it

34:19.927 --> 34:20.803
Go away

34:28.806 --> 34:30.081
Ping. my editor. was out of line

34:30.647 --> 34:31.762
But he's not really so bad

34:32.726 --> 34:35.685
Just a bit stingy!
Never pays his way!

34:36.487 --> 34:38.159
Always says he's broke
when the check arrives

34:38.887 --> 34:40.002
So I thought I'd play a trick on him

34:42.367 --> 34:46.155
At my expense?
Didn't you go a bit far?

34:48.047 --> 34:49.764
He only fell for it because
you're so beautiful

34:50.167 --> 34:53.364
You're quite a flirt!

34:54.766 --> 34:56.166
Just stating the fact!

34:57.927 --> 34:59.246
A small token of apology...

35:01.327 --> 35:03.158
Please accept it

35:04.607 --> 35:05.596
I don't want it

35:06.527 --> 35:08.802
You're still cross. aren't you?

35:10.287 --> 35:12.084
Please accept it
No!

35:12.447 --> 35:14.517
Come on...
No!

35:14.687 --> 35:16.040
It's just a token...

35:17.807 --> 35:20.958
Don't make fun of me
I mean what I say!

35:21.247 --> 35:22.441
Now. get out!

35:27.087 --> 35:28.998
That's good. let it all out

35:30.487 --> 35:31.715
How can I make you feel better?

35:32.207 --> 35:33.845
Slap me again!

35:34.047 --> 35:35.275
Think I wouldn’t dare?

35:36.127 --> 35:37.446
Come closer!

35:43.207 --> 35:44.959
Bastard!

35:53.327 --> 35:54.680
Don't be so petty!

35:55.167 --> 35:56.282
That's enough

35:57.407 --> 35:59.967
I'm courteous enough not to
slap you again

36:00.727 --> 36:02.001
That doesn't mean you can
take advantage!

36:04.527 --> 36:06.677
This time I'll give you face

36:08.527 --> 36:11.519
If there's ever a next time
I'll be less polite

36:12.127 --> 36:13.446
It won't happen again

36:14.047 --> 36:15.446
My face is still numb

36:17.087 --> 36:18.236
Accept it!

36:18.687 --> 36:19.517
No!

36:21.207 --> 36:22.481
They're just a token of my regard

36:23.607 --> 36:25.086
I chose them myself

36:26.647 --> 36:29.559
See if you like them

36:29.807 --> 36:31.320
If you don't. just throw them away

36:40.927 --> 36:42.155
Good

36:50.807 --> 36:52.525
I'll leave now

37:10.247 --> 37:12.681
Calm down!

37:15.087 --> 37:18.443
It's none of your business
who I dated last night!

37:21.647 --> 37:22.602
Who?

37:24.527 --> 37:26.006
Dabao!

37:27.887 --> 37:29.445
Which Dabao?

37:30.527 --> 37:32.722
The fat one or the skinny one?

37:33.287 --> 37:35.118
From Shanghai or from Shandong?

37:36.207 --> 37:39.517
The trouble is
I know so many men named Dabao

37:40.087 --> 37:41.918
How should I know which one you mean?

37:45.207 --> 37:46.196
Yes. I did

37:46.727 --> 37:48.683
What are you going to do about it?

37:51.367 --> 37:52.277
Fine!

37:52.767 --> 37:54.120
I'll be waiting!

38:00.047 --> 38:00.923
Let me just say...

38:02.047 --> 38:03.082
Get out!

38:04.047 --> 38:05.924
You think I can accept this?

38:06.327 --> 38:08.283
Her or me

38:08.527 --> 38:10.006
You'd better choose!

38:10.167 --> 38:11.486
Now get out!

38:48.367 --> 38:51.803
24 December 1967

39:20.007 --> 39:21.281
You're back early!

39:21.647 --> 39:22.682
It's Christmas!

39:23.087 --> 39:24.361
Shouldn’t you behaving
dinner with your boyfriend?

39:25.687 --> 39:26.722
What boyfriend?

39:32.527 --> 39:33.926
Then let's have supper!

39:34.167 --> 39:35.156
Come on...

39:35.967 --> 39:39.516
You have so many girl friends!
You need company?

39:40.487 --> 39:41.397
Go out with them!

39:44.487 --> 39:46.318
They all want to be with me
but I can't choose

39:47.127 --> 39:48.924
The fairest thing is to see
none of them

39:50.287 --> 39:52.517
Come on. no point in staying
cooped up in your room

39:54.167 --> 39:55.156
I'm not in a good mood tonight

39:57.167 --> 39:58.043
I might get drunk...

39:59.247 --> 40:00.965
...and slap you again

40:04.047 --> 40:05.116
That's okay

40:05.767 --> 40:07.280
I'm used to it!

40:08.047 --> 40:09.036
If slapping me would make you happy

40:09.367 --> 40:11.119
take that as my Christmas present!

40:15.087 --> 40:16.042
Come on...

40:16.647 --> 40:17.602
Come with me

40:19.167 --> 40:20.282
Let go!

40:45.847 --> 40:47.803
I didn't expect to spend
Christmas Like this

40:49.447 --> 40:50.436
What were you expecting?

40:54.087 --> 40:55.202
We'd made plans

40:56.847 --> 40:58.405
He was taking me to Singapore

41:00.727 --> 41:02.957
He says it's warm
there at Christmas

41:09.487 --> 41:11.796
So I didn't even
pack winter clothes

41:13.767 --> 41:14.995
What I'm wearing now...

41:16.727 --> 41:18.126
...is for summer!

41:26.367 --> 41:27.846
Have you been to Singapore?

41:30.567 --> 41:32.319
I worked there for several years

41:36.927 --> 41:37.996
What kind of work?

41:39.007 --> 41:40.440
On a newspaper

41:43.367 --> 41:44.641
Is it fun there?

41:46.567 --> 41:47.397
It's okay

41:52.927 --> 41:54.280
Tell me more

41:55.847 --> 41:56.916
I won't be going...

41:58.527 --> 42:00.085
So I'll just have to imagine it

42:06.167 --> 42:07.441
What do you want to know?

42:14.647 --> 42:16.080
How's the climate?

42:20.447 --> 42:21.436
Pretty warm

42:22.967 --> 42:24.161
All year round

42:25.607 --> 42:27.484
Sometimes you can't tell
what season it is

42:31.207 --> 42:32.526
The food stalls are great!

42:33.887 --> 42:35.923
Ping and I ate there after work

42:37.207 --> 42:39.198
We'd eat and drink till dawn

42:46.167 --> 42:47.566
Our land lord was a funny man

42:48.727 --> 42:50.604
Short and fat
and he always wore a skirt...

42:52.487 --> 42:54.842
What the Malays call a 'sarong'

42:58.407 --> 42:59.920
But when you're away from home

43:01.727 --> 43:03.001
...it sometimes gets boring

43:15.247 --> 43:16.680
That was a dull meal!

43:17.687 --> 43:18.961
Another drink somewhere else?

43:20.847 --> 43:22.166
You really Like to drink?

43:23.687 --> 43:24.961
It makes things easy

43:25.487 --> 43:27.318
When I'm drunk. I have no worries!

43:29.807 --> 43:33.356
Won't your girl friends be
missing you tonight?

43:34.727 --> 43:36.001
They're not stuck to me!

43:36.487 --> 43:37.840
They see other men too

43:38.727 --> 43:39.796
We just have fun together

43:41.007 --> 43:42.725
They still need to make a living!

43:45.007 --> 43:45.917
I don't get it

43:47.047 --> 43:49.481
Where does all that fun get you?

43:50.127 --> 43:51.446
If you find the right person...

43:52.247 --> 43:53.316
...why waste time on the others?

43:54.207 --> 43:55.481
If I find the right person!

43:56.407 --> 43:57.522
A man Like me has nothing much

43:58.087 --> 43:58.997
...except free time

44:00.007 --> 44:02.157
That's why I need company

44:03.927 --> 44:05.201
So people are just time-fillers to you?

44:06.127 --> 44:07.116
I wouldn’t say that

44:08.767 --> 44:10.917
Other people can borrow my time too

44:13.647 --> 44:15.080
And this evening?

44:15.847 --> 44:17.644
Are you borrowing me or am
I borrowing you?

44:18.367 --> 44:19.356
No difference!

44:20.527 --> 44:21.926
Maybe I borrowed you earlier...

44:22.487 --> 44:24.125
...and now you're borrowing me

44:24.527 --> 44:25.562
Ridiculous!

44:30.767 --> 44:32.041
Don't get me wrong

44:33.887 --> 44:35.718
I don't intend to take advantage
of you

44:37.447 --> 44:38.402
If that was what I wanted...

44:38.887 --> 44:40.286
...I had plenty of options

44:41.447 --> 44:43.403
I just want us to be drinking pals

44:45.567 --> 44:46.920
Is that okay?

44:49.447 --> 44:50.436
It's hard

44:51.647 --> 44:53.205
But I'll give it a try

44:55.887 --> 44:57.286
Okay...

44:58.367 --> 44:59.925
Let's try!

45:04.047 --> 45:05.878
Where to? Let's drink!

46:37.127 --> 46:39.482
Mr. Chow. you seem happy tonight!

46:40.087 --> 46:41.839
I certainly am
my friends are buying me dinner

46:43.087 --> 46:43.837
This way please...

46:46.607 --> 46:48.518
Ping! Is it someone's birthday?

46:48.807 --> 46:52.277
Better than that
Chow has a new girlfriend!

46:53.167 --> 46:54.998
Definitely worth celebrating!

46:55.647 --> 46:56.841
Mr. Chow. what would you
Like to eat tonight?

46:57.767 --> 46:59.837
Something expensive!

47:01.127 --> 47:01.843
Snake?

47:02.327 --> 47:03.123
Yes. snake would be good

47:03.687 --> 47:05.245
Snake isn't cheap
Can you afford it?

47:05.447 --> 47:06.118
Sure you'll win the bet?

47:06.607 --> 47:08.086
Shut up! Don't mind him

47:08.727 --> 47:10.001
What'll it be
Mr. Chow? Snake!

47:10.927 --> 47:12.121
And a lamb casserole too

47:13.247 --> 47:14.282
And bring Hoi's whiskey

47:14.807 --> 47:15.557
Yes! Good!

47:32.607 --> 47:34.837
Can't Let this go to waste
it's delicious

47:35.487 --> 47:36.886
Where's your girl. Chow?

47:37.487 --> 47:39.876
It's already 2 a. m.
Is she coming?

47:41.287 --> 47:44.882
She can't be coming

47:45.567 --> 47:46.158
I don't think she's coming

47:46.407 --> 47:47.556
It's all your fault

47:47.887 --> 47:49.206
It's because of you
that this happened

47:49.407 --> 47:50.044
Why blame me?

47:50.407 --> 47:51.920
You brought this on yourself

47:52.247 --> 47:54.807
You said she was gentle and obedient

47:55.407 --> 47:56.237
Now we know the truth!

47:57.567 --> 47:59.285
I said she was sometimes obedient...

47:59.927 --> 48:01.645
...and sometimes gentle

48:02.767 --> 48:05.565
But she's full of surprises
that's part of the fun

48:06.407 --> 48:08.967
So. what next?
Yes. what now?

48:09.167 --> 48:11.442
Whatever you feel Like doing

48:16.807 --> 48:18.684
And then what happened?

48:19.207 --> 48:20.401
Tell me!

48:25.967 --> 48:27.798
How are you going to thank me?

48:32.687 --> 48:34.837
Pervert!

48:43.127 --> 48:44.355
Open up!

48:44.967 --> 48:45.604
Who is it?

48:45.847 --> 48:47.121
Open the door!

48:49.927 --> 48:50.916
It's late

48:52.767 --> 48:54.564
You played a fine joke
on me tonight

48:55.567 --> 48:57.319
I finished work Late

48:57.687 --> 48:59.757
Too Late to get there

49:00.727 --> 49:02.001
So I didn't come

49:05.687 --> 49:06.676
What's this?

49:07.127 --> 49:09.846
That's your fault too

49:11.687 --> 49:12.915
How could I know
you'd stand me up?

49:15.007 --> 49:17.760
I thought I'd win a few hundred

49:18.327 --> 49:19.726
Instead I lost my moustache

49:20.367 --> 49:21.482
This is all your fault

49:23.607 --> 49:25.962
You deserved it

49:26.767 --> 49:27.882
Who pushed you into the bet?

49:30.847 --> 49:31.836
I'll tell you something...

49:32.607 --> 49:34.165
Ping asked me not to show up

49:35.847 --> 49:36.802
Anyhow...

49:37.367 --> 49:39.517
I wasn't that fond of
the moustache

49:41.647 --> 49:43.000
You look younger now

49:44.727 --> 49:45.955
Don't you Like it?

49:48.247 --> 49:49.316
You're making fun of me!

49:51.167 --> 49:52.646
You tricked me!

49:56.727 --> 49:58.445
I'll get you for this

50:01.327 --> 50:02.237
How will you make it up to me?

50:03.327 --> 50:04.203
At least give me a kiss

50:08.767 --> 50:09.802
You bit me!

50:10.207 --> 50:11.003
Come and get me!

50:13.767 --> 50:15.803
You're in for it when
I catch you!

50:19.167 --> 50:20.316
Don't touch me there!

50:36.407 --> 50:37.476
What?

50:40.447 --> 50:41.402
What are you doing?

50:41.847 --> 50:44.486
Shaving you Don't!

50:45.287 --> 50:47.323
Who knows where that shaver's been?

50:48.527 --> 50:49.437
It could bring me bad luck

50:57.687 --> 50:58.642
Let's go for Round Two!

51:22.367 --> 51:23.516
Why are you dressed?

51:28.367 --> 51:29.322
I'm going back to my room...

51:30.327 --> 51:31.476
I'm exhausted

51:37.287 --> 51:38.561
This is all I have

51:39.927 --> 51:41.246
Aside from loose change for the bus

51:43.287 --> 51:44.561
Here's $200

51:46.847 --> 51:48.246
Please take it

51:48.487 --> 51:49.920
I don't want it

51:50.527 --> 51:51.755
I wasn't selling

51:53.127 --> 51:54.401
That's not how I meant it

51:55.087 --> 51:58.318
I want to pay for
your torn dress

51:59.127 --> 52:00.003
Please take it

52:03.847 --> 52:04.802
I see...

52:06.247 --> 52:08.556
You're afraid I'll cling to
you. is that it?

52:14.127 --> 52:15.116
Fine...

52:15.607 --> 52:16.835
I'll take $10

52:17.967 --> 52:19.719
Think of it as a discount rate

52:23.647 --> 52:24.875
If you ever want to come over again

52:26.207 --> 52:27.526
...I'll charge the same

53:59.287 --> 54:00.800
I'm going back to my room

54:29.887 --> 54:31.206
Come here

55:02.127 --> 55:03.242
Not tonight

55:04.327 --> 55:05.237
Why not?

55:06.647 --> 55:08.285
Not in the mood?

55:10.727 --> 55:12.206
Can't take the strain tonight

55:14.407 --> 55:16.921
Anyhow. I'm a bit short of cash

55:18.167 --> 55:21.716
Never mind. you can owe me

55:25.087 --> 55:25.758
No....

55:27.047 --> 55:28.196
I don't Like being in debt

55:50.167 --> 55:51.520
The reception's at 6. dinner at 8

55:51.967 --> 55:53.798
I don't mind if you can't make it
just send your gift

55:55.287 --> 55:56.322
No more than you do!

55:56.767 --> 55:58.120
You hold banquets all year round!

55:58.367 --> 55:59.800
I've had four birthday invitations
from you this year!

56:00.687 --> 56:02.917
I'll send over some more
invitation cards later

56:03.407 --> 56:04.396
Think of people with money...

56:04.687 --> 56:06.439
Write in their names and send
them invitations!

56:06.687 --> 56:08.040
Okay. that's settled

56:08.367 --> 56:09.482
Mr. Chow. holding another banquet?

56:10.447 --> 56:12.597
You know we have birthdays
indifferent calendars?

56:13.127 --> 56:14.526
Another of mine has come around

56:14.847 --> 56:15.802
No doubt

56:16.327 --> 56:19.160
Here's one for your boss Alright

56:19.487 --> 56:20.761
Tell him that since
we're so close...

56:21.007 --> 56:23.077
He can deduct his gift from
the rent I owe

56:24.247 --> 56:25.282
Make sure he gets it

56:25.647 --> 56:26.284
Okay

56:31.527 --> 56:32.926
It's Late. what's so urgent?

56:33.367 --> 56:35.119
Just got back from Macau

56:35.367 --> 56:36.925
Chow asked me to bring
you a present

56:39.887 --> 56:40.717
You two went to Macau?

56:41.287 --> 56:43.198
Yes. we had some days off

56:43.687 --> 56:44.881
So we went to the casino

56:52.127 --> 56:53.401
Oh. it's beautiful

56:54.527 --> 56:56.358
He says he found some money...

56:56.967 --> 56:58.320
...in his pocket

56:58.927 --> 57:01.487
So before losing it all
at the tables...

57:02.527 --> 57:03.482
...he bought you a present

57:06.127 --> 57:06.957
Where is he?

57:07.767 --> 57:10.600
Not back yet
You know what he's Like

57:11.407 --> 57:12.522
Extravagant at
the start of the month

57:13.047 --> 57:14.400
...and broke well before the end

57:15.007 --> 57:17.157
He made several thousand
hosting that party

57:17.887 --> 57:19.002
So now he's really
enjoying himself!

57:20.127 --> 57:21.162
Is he there alone?

57:21.807 --> 57:23.559
Of course not!
There's a gang of them

57:24.327 --> 57:25.680
He likes company

57:27.887 --> 57:29.081
Was he always Like this?

57:29.727 --> 57:31.285
Let's not talk about him
Let’s have a drink

57:37.487 --> 57:39.159
But I should warn you...

57:40.007 --> 57:41.042
I know you Like Chow a lot

57:41.967 --> 57:44.037
Don't waste your time on him

57:44.527 --> 57:45.277
He's not serious!

58:06.607 --> 58:07.835
Guess who?

58:08.607 --> 58:10.802
There's only one possibility!

58:12.487 --> 58:13.522
Let me have a bite first!

58:22.447 --> 58:23.562
What are you doing here?

58:27.327 --> 58:28.476
What am I doing here?

58:29.967 --> 58:31.002
What do you think?

59:03.847 --> 59:05.280
I thought I was pretty wild

59:06.607 --> 59:08.245
But you're much wilder!

59:10.087 --> 59:10.917
Pay up!

59:12.407 --> 59:14.284
I haven't seen you for ages

59:16.367 --> 59:17.356
I've been busy

59:18.447 --> 59:19.402
Liar

59:20.007 --> 59:21.884
Tell me the truth

59:24.007 --> 59:24.837
I am!

59:29.247 --> 59:30.805
Who was that woman the other day?

59:33.607 --> 59:34.483
What woman?

59:35.847 --> 59:36.677
Don't pretend

59:39.367 --> 59:41.642
I saw her leaving your room

59:43.087 --> 59:44.236
Who is she?

59:45.687 --> 59:46.483
A friend

59:46.967 --> 59:47.877
A friend?

59:51.567 --> 59:53.285
What was she doing in your room?

59:55.007 --> 59:56.326
Don't be nosy. alright?

59:57.527 --> 59:58.437
Go back to your room

59:59.327 --> 01:00:00.316
I have work to do

01:00:05.487 --> 01:00:06.522
I won't!

01:00:08.927 --> 01:00:10.280
I'm sleeping here tonight

01:00:11.927 --> 01:00:13.280
An overnight stay is expensive

01:00:13.727 --> 01:00:14.637
No problem

01:00:15.327 --> 01:00:16.726
Name your price

01:00:18.367 --> 01:00:21.757
I'd pay anything to be with you
Every day

01:00:23.727 --> 01:00:24.523
Retail is fine

01:00:25.767 --> 01:00:27.086
Wholesale is out of the question

01:00:27.967 --> 01:00:28.843
Why?

01:00:29.527 --> 01:00:30.562
I just don't Like it

01:00:33.567 --> 01:00:34.966
Could you make an exception for me?

01:00:36.407 --> 01:00:37.123
No

01:00:40.687 --> 01:00:42.518
You treat all women Like this?

01:00:44.127 --> 01:00:45.037
Except one

01:00:45.887 --> 01:00:46.637
Who?

01:00:47.367 --> 01:00:48.436
My mother

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:49.722
I'm serious

01:00:54.127 --> 01:00:55.879
I don't mind you having other women

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:58.720
But I won't be treated
the same as them

01:01:05.007 --> 01:01:06.201
I don't care if you love me or not

01:01:08.327 --> 01:01:09.601
I'II Love you anyway

01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:15.159
Since we got together. I haven't
brought other men back

01:01:17.967 --> 01:01:19.719
I hoped you'd think the same way

01:01:22.687 --> 01:01:23.802
Will you promise me that?

01:01:24.487 --> 01:01:25.363
No

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:39.922
I see...

01:01:42.087 --> 01:01:43.122
Then we're through

01:01:49.727 --> 01:01:50.796
I'll never bother you

01:01:51.727 --> 01:01:52.876
And I don't ever want you in
my room again

01:01:58.927 --> 01:01:59.837
Here. $10

01:02:01.207 --> 01:02:02.799
Tonight. I'm paying

01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:09.802
Thank you!

01:02:11.487 --> 01:02:13.842
If you're ever in the mood
feel free to come over

01:02:15.367 --> 01:02:16.880
I'll charge you the same

01:02:34.687 --> 01:02:35.563
Having fun?

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:37.996
What do you care?

01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:09.476
You were rather loud Last night

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.156
I meant to be

01:03:13.527 --> 01:03:15.916
You bring back women
why shouldn’t I have men?

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:19.285
I want to see if you really don't mind

01:03:39.647 --> 01:03:42.605
I won't go. why don't
you come here instead?

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:51.482
Forget it! Don't come!

01:05:13.927 --> 01:05:14.996
After Bai Ling moved out...

01:05:15.327 --> 01:05:16.885
...she started dating Dabao

01:05:18.327 --> 01:05:20.204
And I saw other women too

01:05:20.967 --> 01:05:23.640
If our paths ever crossed
we'd pretend not to see each other

01:05:25.407 --> 01:05:27.443
Rather pathetic. I know

01:05:28.727 --> 01:05:30.319
But it was better for us
to end it this way

01:05:31.207 --> 01:05:32.356
...she pops up in my stories

01:05:42.727 --> 01:05:44.479
Your change. please check it

01:05:45.527 --> 01:05:46.164
Thank you

01:05:47.687 --> 01:05:48.756
Are you going out Later?

01:05:50.007 --> 01:05:50.883
Why?

01:05:52.647 --> 01:05:55.241
Could you post this letter for me?

01:06:02.127 --> 01:06:03.082
Sure

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:05.803
Then Miss Wang came back

01:06:06.767 --> 01:06:09.156
I knew from the familiar sound
coming through the wall

01:06:12.247 --> 01:06:13.760
Please take me with you!

01:06:15.487 --> 01:06:16.442
Good!

01:06:17.927 --> 01:06:18.962
What are you doing?

01:06:19.327 --> 01:06:20.726
Wasn't I clear?

01:06:21.167 --> 01:06:22.759
Don't contact that Japanese man!

01:06:23.247 --> 01:06:25.044
Why are you writing to him in secret?

01:06:25.647 --> 01:06:26.716
Aren't you ashamed?

01:06:27.927 --> 01:06:29.076
Return his Letter!

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.357
No?

01:06:59.487 --> 01:07:00.522
What are you reading?

01:07:01.727 --> 01:07:02.557
A martial-arts novel

01:07:03.847 --> 01:07:04.643
You Like them?

01:07:14.207 --> 01:07:15.560
If your friend wants to
send you more letters

01:07:16.327 --> 01:07:17.362
and you don't want your dad to know

01:07:18.607 --> 01:07:19.596
tell him to send them to my room

01:07:20.527 --> 01:07:21.960
I'll pass them on to you

01:07:31.567 --> 01:07:34.365
She looked happier when she
came back this time

01:07:35.447 --> 01:07:38.120
We talked more often

01:07:38.447 --> 01:07:40.483
Mr. Chow. another Letter for you

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:45.482
Another!

01:07:47.207 --> 01:07:48.765
Those Japanese girls get
so carried away!

01:08:15.447 --> 01:08:17.403
Let's see each other again

01:08:20.447 --> 01:08:25.237
Then. if you still think we
shouldn’t be together...

01:08:27.046 --> 01:08:28.877
...tell me so. frankly

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:34.323
That day. six years ago...

01:08:35.886 --> 01:08:39.720
...a rainbow appeared in my heart

01:08:40.046 --> 01:08:41.877
It's still there

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:44.767
Like a flame burning inside me

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:49.881
But what are your real
feelings for me?

01:08:52.006 --> 01:08:55.044
Are they Like a rainbow
after the rain?

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.081
Or...

01:09:05.447 --> 01:09:08.917
...did that rainbow
fade away long ago?

01:09:14.607 --> 01:09:16.484
I'm waiting for your answer

01:09:29.846 --> 01:09:31.519
Why do you write all that
stuff about sex?

01:09:32.607 --> 01:09:33.756
So I won't starve!

01:09:35.487 --> 01:09:37.443
Don't you worry about
your reputation?

01:09:40.727 --> 01:09:41.921
Maybe I'm not such a nice guy

01:09:44.006 --> 01:09:45.439
Why not try writing
something else?

01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:46.841
Who'd read it?

01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:49.002
How about a martial-arts novel?

01:09:49.647 --> 01:09:51.000
People Love them

01:09:52.247 --> 01:09:53.202
That's too hard

01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:57.160
I tried once
co-writing it with someone

01:09:58.247 --> 01:09:59.999
We locked ourselves
away for months

01:10:01.767 --> 01:10:02.722
Just got sore heads

01:10:04.687 --> 01:10:06.040
Those were good times...

01:10:09.327 --> 01:10:10.601
I Like writing too

01:10:11.527 --> 01:10:13.722
It's hard to make a
living by writing

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:17.038
I just do it for fun

01:10:18.567 --> 01:10:20.125
I'll show you some of my stuff

01:10:20.287 --> 01:10:21.322
Please do

01:10:31.047 --> 01:10:33.003
Here you are. read this first

01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:41.198
Wow. you're prolific!

01:10:42.527 --> 01:10:43.562
When you've read it
tell me what you think

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:45.317
Don't forget to give it back!

01:10:46.127 --> 01:10:46.957
Sure!

01:11:09.424 --> 01:11:10.777
Have you read my story yet?

01:11:10.984 --> 01:11:11.655
I have

01:11:12.584 --> 01:11:13.460
What did you think?

01:11:17.984 --> 01:11:19.383
I think you should never
write another word

01:11:21.864 --> 01:11:22.660
Why not?

01:11:26.864 --> 01:11:27.694
You're so good

01:11:28.224 --> 01:11:29.782
You could put me out of work

01:11:37.344 --> 01:11:38.982
"The Spider Sage thrusts
out his right fist!"

01:11:39.704 --> 01:11:41.934
"Two chopsticks take off
Like rockets!"

01:11:42.984 --> 01:11:44.019
"They Land with explosive force!"

01:11:44.544 --> 01:11:45.579
"Kaboom!
The mountain splits apart!"

01:11:47.184 --> 01:11:48.583
Slow down. I can't keep up

01:11:49.384 --> 01:11:50.533
Come on. they're waiting for it

01:11:51.304 --> 01:11:52.259
Alright. alright

01:11:53.264 --> 01:11:54.060
Caught up?

01:11:55.384 --> 01:11:56.134
Go on

01:11:57.504 --> 01:11:58.220
Where was I?

01:11:59.224 --> 01:12:00.418
"The mountain splits apart"

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:02.053
Right...
"The mountain splits apart... "

01:12:03.744 --> 01:12:04.859
"... smashing Iron Abacus to the ground!"

01:12:05.784 --> 01:12:06.660
Iron Abacus?

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:09.017
Isn't he dead?

01:12:09.944 --> 01:12:14.381
Is he?

01:12:15.024 --> 01:12:15.900
Then make it Iron Head

01:12:16.464 --> 01:12:18.182
Where did Iron
Head come from all of a sudden?

01:12:19.144 --> 01:12:20.941
Hey. anything goes in
martial-arts novels!

01:12:23.864 --> 01:12:24.740
Why don't you get some rest?

01:12:24.984 --> 01:12:26.178
I'll finish it for you

01:12:28.104 --> 01:12:28.854
Okay

01:12:38.464 --> 01:12:39.658
It felt Like having an assistant

01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:45.012
When I was I ate with my copy.
I asked her to ghost it for me

01:12:46.264 --> 01:12:47.583
She was just a girl...

01:12:48.384 --> 01:12:50.944
...but she could write as
raunchily as the best of us

01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:54.178
We got a Long very well

01:12:56.224 --> 01:12:58.340
That was my happiest summer ever

01:13:02.104 --> 01:13:03.332
But it didn't Last...

01:13:19.504 --> 01:13:22.860
I encouraged her to face
up to her father

01:13:24.104 --> 01:13:25.219
But she didn't dare

01:13:26.664 --> 01:13:27.813
She wanted to pay her own way

01:13:29.344 --> 01:13:31.016
So I got her job in the
cloakroom at a club

01:13:33.544 --> 01:13:35.023
Thanks!

01:13:36.664 --> 01:13:37.619
She told her father...

01:13:39.904 --> 01:13:41.098
...she was going out with me

01:13:50.224 --> 01:13:53.660
Sometimes I found an excuse to
pick her up after work

01:13:54.544 --> 01:13:55.374
You're here Late

01:13:55.904 --> 01:13:56.814
If you're ready to go
I have a taxi waiting

01:13:57.904 --> 01:14:00.338
I can give you a lift back

01:14:06.744 --> 01:14:07.699
No thanks

01:14:12.424 --> 01:14:14.255
Then I won't wait

01:14:37.784 --> 01:14:39.615
Feelings can creep up on
you unawares

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:43.863
I knew that. but did she?

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:50.854
She was always asking...

01:14:51.544 --> 01:14:53.774
...if there was anything at
all that never changed

01:14:55.064 --> 01:14:56.179
I could see what was on her mind

01:14:58.224 --> 01:15:00.863
I promised to write a story for her
based on my observation

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.855
Something to show her what her
boyfriend was thinking

01:15:05.224 --> 01:15:06.179
As a joke...

01:15:07.224 --> 01:15:09.533
.. we thought of calling it '2047'

01:15:16.824 --> 01:15:18.143
But maybe I was being too oblique

01:15:19.344 --> 01:15:21.619
I'd begun to feel that it wasn't
about her boyfriend at all

01:15:23.464 --> 01:15:25.056
Rather it was more about me

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:56.742
So I began imagining myself as
a Japanese man...

01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:01.255
...on a train for 2046...

01:16:02.864 --> 01:16:05.298
...falling for an android with
delayed reaction

01:16:15.464 --> 01:16:17.932
If someone wants to Leave 2046
how Long will it take?

01:16:19.144 --> 01:16:20.099
No one can say

01:16:21.384 --> 01:16:23.181
Some people get away fairly easily

01:16:24.264 --> 01:16:25.413
Others find that...

01:16:26.224 --> 01:16:28.135
...it takes them much longer

01:16:28.704 --> 01:16:30.342
It takes great strength

01:16:30.944 --> 01:16:32.423
And it can hurt terribly

01:16:32.784 --> 01:16:34.820
I forget how Long I've been
on this train

01:16:36.544 --> 01:16:37.693
I start to feel very lonely

01:16:38.504 --> 01:16:40.813
It's rather boring at first

01:16:41.784 --> 01:16:43.502
But you slowly get used to it

01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:45.782
We have a range of cabin attendants

01:16:46.464 --> 01:16:48.182
They can satisfy your every need

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:50.735
They will serve you devotedly

01:16:51.264 --> 01:16:52.140
Like an intimate friend

01:16:53.344 --> 01:16:55.778
But you must never fall in
Love with them

01:16:56.384 --> 01:17:00.377
Who'd ever fall for an android?

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:02.819
Who can say?

01:17:03.384 --> 01:17:05.102
Events can creep up on you...

01:17:05.544 --> 01:17:07.216
...without you even noticing

01:17:08.144 --> 01:17:10.180
It happens all the time

01:17:58.104 --> 01:18:00.095
Paragraph 201 in the
Passengers' Guide...

01:18:01.064 --> 01:18:02.656
...warns that Area 1224-1225...

01:18:02.904 --> 01:18:04.223
...is especially cold

01:18:07.264 --> 01:18:08.822
The train heating won't be
strong enough

01:18:09.824 --> 01:18:12.384
Passengers are advised to hug
each other to keep warm

01:18:12.624 --> 01:18:15.502
Since I'm the only passenger...

01:18:16.704 --> 01:18:18.535
...I hug my android cabin attendant

01:18:23.584 --> 01:18:26.894
I wonder if it's her mechanism
or just my imagination...

01:18:28.544 --> 01:18:30.500
But I sense some responsive
warmth in her artificial body

01:18:43.504 --> 01:18:44.983
Why do you want to Leave 2046?

01:18:52.904 --> 01:18:54.701
Do you know...

01:18:55.544 --> 01:18:59.139
...what people did
in the old days...

01:18:59.864 --> 01:19:02.617
...when they had secrets they
didn't want to share?

01:19:07.544 --> 01:19:09.216
They'd climb a mountain...

01:19:09.704 --> 01:19:11.456
Find a tree...

01:19:13.184 --> 01:19:15.334
Carve a hole in it...

01:19:16.024 --> 01:19:22.702
Whisper the secret into the hole...

01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:28.576
And cover it up with mud

01:19:31.544 --> 01:19:32.579
That way...

01:19:33.224 --> 01:19:36.660
...nobody else would ever
learn the secret

01:19:50.304 --> 01:19:51.817
I'll be your tree!

01:19:53.504 --> 01:19:56.780
Tell me. and nobody else
will ever know

01:20:02.544 --> 01:20:04.057
I always...

01:20:07.264 --> 01:20:08.413
I always...

01:20:10.424 --> 01:20:11.334
I always...

01:20:17.424 --> 01:20:19.415
Very funny! I always...

01:20:24.504 --> 01:20:26.017
I always...

01:20:27.624 --> 01:20:29.660
Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046...

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:31.534
I always...

01:20:31.784 --> 01:20:32.853
...I gave them some vague answer

01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:35.375
I always...

01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:42.418
I once fell in Love with someone

01:20:44.544 --> 01:20:46.694
I couldn’t stop wondering
whether she loved me or not

01:20:49.904 --> 01:20:51.576
I found an android which
Looked just Like her

01:20:53.824 --> 01:20:55.735
I thought the android might
give me the answer

01:22:23.824 --> 01:22:26.975
10 hours Later

01:22:57.504 --> 01:22:59.620
I have a secret to tell you

01:23:03.624 --> 01:23:05.580
Leave with me

01:23:14.024 --> 01:23:16.060
I have a secret to tell you

01:23:18.384 --> 01:23:20.375
Leave with me

01:23:26.704 --> 01:23:27.819
I kept on asking

01:23:30.024 --> 01:23:31.582
But she never answered

01:23:34.944 --> 01:23:36.662
I began dreaming up excuses
for her silence

01:23:38.624 --> 01:23:41.297
Do you know the Buddhist canon?

01:23:41.944 --> 01:23:43.457
'The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings'?

01:23:44.064 --> 01:23:45.258
The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings

01:23:46.824 --> 01:23:48.974
It's all about the gods...

01:23:49.944 --> 01:23:51.980
.. and how they go through
this process too

01:23:52.904 --> 01:23:57.341
Our cabin attendants are
superbly designed

01:23:58.744 --> 01:24:00.974
But there's one problem

01:24:02.224 --> 01:24:04.294
When they've served on so
many Long journeys...

01:24:05.184 --> 01:24:07.175
...fatigue begins to set in

01:24:07.864 --> 01:24:10.981
They might want to laugh...

01:24:12.024 --> 01:24:14.140
...but the smile would be slow to come

01:24:15.424 --> 01:24:16.823
They might want to cry...

01:24:17.744 --> 01:24:21.373
...but the tear wouldn’t
well up till next day!

01:24:23.344 --> 01:24:26.814
This one is failing fast

01:24:44.944 --> 01:24:47.583
I think you'd better give up

01:25:03.944 --> 01:25:05.093
I grew desperate

01:25:06.744 --> 01:25:07.620
I felt Like giving up

01:25:10.744 --> 01:25:11.972
But I was soon trying again

01:25:24.104 --> 01:25:26.220
I have a secret to tell you

01:25:27.744 --> 01:25:29.177
Will you Leave with me?

01:25:39.144 --> 01:25:41.419
I have a secret to tell you

01:25:57.184 --> 01:25:59.652
Will you Leave with me?

01:26:25.984 --> 01:26:28.179
Do you know what people
did in the old days...

01:26:28.664 --> 01:26:29.733
...when they had secrets?

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:46.896
They'd climb a mountain. find a tree

01:26:47.784 --> 01:26:50.981
Carve a hole in it...

01:27:21.224 --> 01:27:23.055
990...

01:27:23.704 --> 01:27:26.423
991...

01:27:27.424 --> 01:27:29.619
992...

01:27:30.304 --> 01:27:32.454
993...

01:27:33.824 --> 01:27:36.657
994...

01:27:37.464 --> 01:27:39.898
995...

01:27:40.424 --> 01:27:42.062
I slowly began to doubt myself

01:27:45.464 --> 01:27:46.340
The reason she didn't answer...

01:27:48.104 --> 01:27:49.696
...was not simply that her
reactions were delayed

01:27:50.584 --> 01:27:52.575
It's simply that she didn't Love me

01:27:54.784 --> 01:27:56.183
So at Last I got it

01:27:57.584 --> 01:27:59.097
It's entirely beyond my control

01:28:00.544 --> 01:28:01.659
The only thing Left for me...

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:04.693
...was to give up

01:28:41.304 --> 01:28:44.262
24 December 1968

01:29:59.544 --> 01:30:01.341
Why are you inviting me to
Christmas dinner?

01:30:01.624 --> 01:30:03.740
You know how much I'll lose in
tips by not working?

01:30:06.504 --> 01:30:09.382
Wouldn’t it be awful
to be alone tonight?

01:30:10.704 --> 01:30:12.296
I need company

01:30:14.104 --> 01:30:15.139
That means me?

01:30:21.864 --> 01:30:23.138
Your boyfriend hasn't
written in a while

01:30:28.584 --> 01:30:29.699
I told him not to

01:30:32.064 --> 01:30:33.338
Anyway. It's hopeless

01:30:35.544 --> 01:30:36.818
No point waiting for me

01:30:40.144 --> 01:30:42.374
Why is it hopeless?
Go and Look for him!

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:45.292
If you don't. it really
will be hopeless

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:51.973
My dad will never give his consent

01:31:06.424 --> 01:31:07.413
If you were him...

01:31:08.864 --> 01:31:10.138
...what would you be doing tonight?

01:31:14.224 --> 01:31:15.259
Why don't you ask him?

01:31:16.024 --> 01:31:17.377
Have you got his phone number?

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:39.616
I can't hear you

01:31:40.864 --> 01:31:42.092
Can you speak louder?

01:31:45.504 --> 01:31:47.335
I'm already shouting!

01:31:49.184 --> 01:31:51.334
I felt Like Santa Claus that night

01:31:53.504 --> 01:31:54.573
I took her to the newspaper office...

01:31:55.544 --> 01:31:57.216
...and Let her make a
Long-distance call to her boyfriend

01:31:59.184 --> 01:32:00.458
I was happy...

01:32:01.344 --> 01:32:02.697
...to see her so happy

01:32:04.664 --> 01:32:06.302
In fact. zone 1224-1225...

01:32:07.864 --> 01:32:10.014
...meant Christmas
Eve and Christmas Day

01:32:11.704 --> 01:32:12.978
On the night before Christmas...

01:32:13.384 --> 01:32:15.773
...many people need a bit
more warmth than usual

01:32:17.144 --> 01:32:19.499
I didn't get that

01:32:22.304 --> 01:32:23.817
Maybe that was for the best

01:33:13.304 --> 01:33:15.898
10 hours Later

01:33:17.824 --> 01:33:18.700
I realized...

01:33:18.904 --> 01:33:20.337
...the reason the android
didn't answer...

01:33:21.704 --> 01:33:22.739
...had nothing to do with
her mechanism wearing out

01:33:24.744 --> 01:33:26.097
Nor that she didn't Like him

01:33:27.264 --> 01:33:28.060
More likely...

01:33:28.304 --> 01:33:30.022
...she already Loved someone else

01:33:34.424 --> 01:33:36.221
Soon after that. she went to Japan

01:33:38.264 --> 01:33:41.893
I gave her a copy of my story "2047"

01:33:43.424 --> 01:33:44.539
I hope she read it

01:33:48.584 --> 01:33:52.418
100 hours Later

01:33:57.184 --> 01:34:00.938
1000 hours Later

01:34:21.824 --> 01:34:23.337
Love is all a matter of timing

01:34:25.544 --> 01:34:27.023
It's no good meeting
the right person...

01:34:27.944 --> 01:34:29.093
...too soon or too Late

01:34:39.984 --> 01:34:42.896
If I'd lived in another
time or place...

01:34:43.184 --> 01:34:45.778
...my story might have had a
very different ending

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:38.982
I have to tell you...

01:35:39.904 --> 01:35:40.700
Yes?

01:35:41.264 --> 01:35:42.299
I'll be away for a couple of days

01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:45.623
Please pay my daughter
this month's rent

01:35:46.384 --> 01:35:47.134
She's back?

01:35:47.744 --> 01:35:51.134
Not Jing wen? I mean pay my
younger girl. Jie wen

01:35:53.584 --> 01:35:56.052
So your worries are over!
Going on holiday?

01:35:56.544 --> 01:35:58.535
No. I have to go to Japan

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:00.539
But you hate Japanese!

01:36:00.984 --> 01:36:01.894
Why go to Japan?

01:36:02.504 --> 01:36:04.062
Jing wen is getting married

01:36:05.224 --> 01:36:09.297
Congratulations

01:36:10.864 --> 01:36:13.139
I wasn't sure whether to go or not

01:36:13.904 --> 01:36:16.862
Now I've decided...
I just want her to be happy

01:36:19.184 --> 01:36:21.744
When do you Leave?
Can you help me choose a present?

01:36:22.384 --> 01:36:23.134
No need for that

01:36:26.824 --> 01:36:28.701
She wanted me to ask you something

01:36:29.264 --> 01:36:29.901
What is it?

01:36:30.504 --> 01:36:33.735
She read your story '2047'.
She Likes it a lot

01:36:34.304 --> 01:36:36.898
But she finds the ending too sad

01:36:37.344 --> 01:36:39.460
She wonders if you can change it?

01:36:42.944 --> 01:36:43.979
I'll see what I can do

01:37:00.304 --> 01:37:04.013
An hour Later

01:37:17.104 --> 01:37:20.938
10 hours Later

01:37:28.984 --> 01:37:32.135
100 hours Later

01:37:58.304 --> 01:37:59.532
Taxi!

01:37:59.784 --> 01:38:01.661
I also Like the story to
have a happy ending

01:38:02.584 --> 01:38:04.256
But I don't know how to write it

01:38:05.624 --> 01:38:08.502
Some years back I had a
happy ending in my grasp

01:38:09.904 --> 01:38:11.337
But I Let it slip away

01:38:24.944 --> 01:38:27.060
Don't turn your back on me!

01:38:29.344 --> 01:38:30.538
Has he been here?
What's it to you?

01:38:30.864 --> 01:38:32.183
While I was depressed.
I ran into Lulu again

01:38:33.704 --> 01:38:35.342
She hadn't changed.
still intensively jealous

01:38:36.024 --> 01:38:36.695
You think he's yours?

01:38:36.904 --> 01:38:38.053
I thought you knew him well!

01:38:38.304 --> 01:38:39.180
That's the way he is!

01:38:39.824 --> 01:38:40.893
We've just been amusing ourselves

01:38:41.864 --> 01:38:43.422
So control yourself. Missy!

01:39:12.984 --> 01:39:14.258
Watching her taught me something

01:39:17.064 --> 01:39:18.099
When you don't take
'no' for an answer...

01:39:19.144 --> 01:39:20.372
...there is still a chance
you’ll get what you want

01:39:39.504 --> 01:39:42.098
18 months Later

01:39:51.504 --> 01:39:54.462
Hello. is Mr. Chow there?

01:39:58.064 --> 01:40:01.534
I know I have no right to ask...

01:40:03.184 --> 01:40:05.015
...but they say I need a guarantor

01:40:08.104 --> 01:40:11.574
The man who recruits
girls for the nightclub...

01:40:12.824 --> 01:40:13.893
...says he knows you

01:40:15.704 --> 01:40:16.659
Can you talk to him for me?

01:40:22.944 --> 01:40:23.899
No problem

01:40:25.344 --> 01:40:26.299
I know the man you mean

01:40:29.744 --> 01:40:30.893
I'll see him in a day or two

01:40:33.064 --> 01:40:34.463
Why did you choose Singapore?

01:40:36.824 --> 01:40:39.782
I don't want to stay here any Longer

01:40:40.304 --> 01:40:43.535
I've been thinking
about it for sometime

01:40:44.064 --> 01:40:45.702
I want to take a Look at the place

01:40:49.504 --> 01:40:50.823
Don't drink too much

01:40:52.104 --> 01:40:54.379
You don't Look well

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:59.782
Don't worry. it won't kill me

01:41:07.264 --> 01:41:08.379
You know what?

01:41:10.344 --> 01:41:12.494
I came by here at Christmas

01:41:16.104 --> 01:41:17.253
I thought I might run into you

01:41:19.144 --> 01:41:20.259
Why didn't you call me first?

01:41:22.824 --> 01:41:23.620
I don't know

01:41:26.304 --> 01:41:27.259
I came on impulse

01:41:38.024 --> 01:41:39.013
I don't know why

01:41:43.544 --> 01:41:45.136
That night I suddenly
missed you so much

01:41:51.504 --> 01:41:53.415
We're drinking pals

01:41:54.504 --> 01:41:55.300
Of course you'll miss me

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.217
You're right

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:11.023
"We're drinking pals"

01:42:23.304 --> 01:42:24.134
Let's go

01:42:27.024 --> 01:42:27.979
Waiter

01:42:28.304 --> 01:42:29.214
The check

01:42:33.224 --> 01:42:34.373
Where are you staying?

01:42:36.224 --> 01:42:39.216
In a hotel. a rather small room

01:42:41.584 --> 01:42:42.983
But It's not too bad

01:42:44.184 --> 01:42:45.503
I'll see you back

01:42:47.064 --> 01:42:47.860
No. thanks

01:42:49.104 --> 01:42:51.015
I've just moved in. It's a mess

01:42:53.464 --> 01:42:55.375
I'll invite you once It's cleaned up

01:42:58.544 --> 01:42:59.693
I'll go first

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:18.693
Seeing how much Bai Ling had changed...

01:43:19.544 --> 01:43:20.977
...I was suddenly
overcome by a feeling of grief

01:43:22.144 --> 01:43:23.133
Indeed. Last Christmas...

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:25.213
...I was not in Hong Kong

01:43:27.624 --> 01:43:29.819
24 December. 1969

01:43:51.944 --> 01:43:53.013
Have you seen Miss Su?

01:43:53.824 --> 01:43:56.099
Miss Su... not for some time

01:43:57.624 --> 01:43:58.773
Any idea where she might be?

01:43:59.184 --> 01:44:00.299
Probably back in Phnom Penh

01:44:02.384 --> 01:44:04.978
I didn't want to spend
Christmas 1969 in Hong Kong

01:44:06.184 --> 01:44:08.903
So I visited Singapore
and went back to the casino

01:44:11.264 --> 01:44:13.334
I waited for several days
but Black Spider never turned up

01:44:14.664 --> 01:44:15.779
No one knew where she was

01:44:16.944 --> 01:44:17.854
Some thought she'd gone
back to Phnom Penh

01:44:19.264 --> 01:44:20.379
Others thought she was dead

01:44:24.824 --> 01:44:26.860
Ping and I began working in
Singapore in 1963

01:44:30.064 --> 01:44:31.099
When my life Lost most of
its meaning...

01:44:34.104 --> 01:44:35.378
...I started gambling every day

01:44:41.424 --> 01:44:42.300
Those were hard times for me

01:44:43.024 --> 01:44:44.423
And only one person
came to my rescue

01:44:45.664 --> 01:44:46.699
A professional gambler

01:44:47.464 --> 01:44:48.613
Some said she was a cheat

01:44:50.424 --> 01:44:51.539
She always wore black

01:44:51.944 --> 01:44:53.423
They called her Black Spider

01:44:54.904 --> 01:44:56.940
She kept her black glove on
for 365 days of the year

01:44:58.704 --> 01:44:59.659
Nobody knew why for sure

01:45:01.744 --> 01:45:03.735
Had her hand been chopped
off for cheating?

01:45:05.024 --> 01:45:06.343
Did the glove cover up a fake hand?

01:45:08.464 --> 01:45:09.499
Nobody really knew

01:45:30.704 --> 01:45:32.296
Why do you wear that black glove?

01:45:34.504 --> 01:45:35.493
It's a habit

01:45:37.984 --> 01:45:38.894
You're not from here?

01:45:41.184 --> 01:45:42.094
I am from Phnom Penh

01:45:44.824 --> 01:45:48.373
What a coincidence!
I was just in Cambodia

01:45:53.264 --> 01:45:55.380
The place is in chaos
what were you doing there?

01:45:58.104 --> 01:45:59.219
The newspaper sent me

01:46:02.984 --> 01:46:04.133
You're a journalist?

01:46:05.704 --> 01:46:06.739
Not any more

01:46:09.224 --> 01:46:10.054
Why's that?

01:46:14.184 --> 01:46:17.972
They made some changes
and I'm now a 'consultant'

01:46:18.744 --> 01:46:21.417
On half-pay. with next to nothing to do

01:46:28.104 --> 01:46:30.299
So why are you spending
your time in the casino?

01:46:33.184 --> 01:46:34.742
I tried to win enough to
pay my way back to Hong Kong

01:46:40.344 --> 01:46:41.743
You Lost a lot?

01:46:42.384 --> 01:46:43.658
A few thousand

01:46:50.064 --> 01:46:52.100
You should never set foot
in a casino in a bad mood

01:46:53.624 --> 01:46:54.818
You won't win

01:46:58.784 --> 01:46:59.773
I didn't expect to win

01:47:00.464 --> 01:47:01.374
I just hoped to get back my stake

01:47:08.384 --> 01:47:10.215
If you have any Left...

01:47:13.544 --> 01:47:14.943
...I can help you

01:47:16.504 --> 01:47:17.414
On one condition

01:47:18.264 --> 01:47:18.935
When you've got your money back...

01:47:20.664 --> 01:47:21.733
...stop gambling

01:47:29.904 --> 01:47:31.656
Why are you helping me?

01:47:33.264 --> 01:47:34.219
I take a commission

01:47:35.984 --> 01:47:38.782
10% of whatever I win for you

01:47:44.984 --> 01:47:46.781
Think it over

01:47:53.064 --> 01:47:54.861
What good to her...

01:47:55.104 --> 01:47:56.219
...were her tiny
commissions on my winnings?

01:47:57.664 --> 01:47:59.655
After that. we went back to
the casino night after night

01:48:00.544 --> 01:48:03.217
We'd eat at the stall next
to the railway station

01:48:04.584 --> 01:48:07.496
She won back all the money I'd Lost+

01:48:17.664 --> 01:48:18.540
Thank you

01:48:19.984 --> 01:48:21.337
Don't thank me. It's yours

01:48:26.584 --> 01:48:28.097
If you need me again tomorrow...

01:48:28.664 --> 01:48:30.017
...I'll be waiting here after dinner

01:48:35.624 --> 01:48:37.216
I still don't know your name

01:48:43.624 --> 01:48:46.218
It's Su... Su Li zhen

01:48:52.424 --> 01:48:55.416
A few years ago I fell in Love
with another man's wife

01:48:56.024 --> 01:48:57.537
Her name was also Su Li zhen

01:49:02.504 --> 01:49:04.859
It was because of her that
I moved to Singapore

01:49:07.144 --> 01:49:10.295
I never dreamed I'd meet
another Su Li zhen

01:49:16.904 --> 01:49:20.135
I told her a lot about the
other Su Li zhen

01:49:21.384 --> 01:49:22.419
At first. we kept it secret

01:49:23.424 --> 01:49:25.096
But gossip soon spread

01:49:26.584 --> 01:49:27.903
Later we moved into a hotel

01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:30.583
We had Room 2046

01:49:34.504 --> 01:49:36.540
When I think back. the whole
thing was Like a dream

01:49:38.704 --> 01:49:40.057
You Loved her deeply?

01:49:46.664 --> 01:49:47.619
It's history

01:49:50.424 --> 01:49:51.493
Let's change the subject

01:49:52.784 --> 01:49:55.093
You. what did you do before?

01:50:02.064 --> 01:50:04.532
You want to know about me?

01:50:13.704 --> 01:50:14.978
Come on. we'll play high-low

01:50:15.744 --> 01:50:17.541
If you win. I'll tell you everything

01:50:37.064 --> 01:50:38.816
It struck me that her past...

01:50:39.424 --> 01:50:40.823
...was Like the hand she
always kept gloved

01:50:41.744 --> 01:50:42.620
A mystery with no solution

01:51:00.544 --> 01:51:01.897
Of all the men I've met...

01:51:03.624 --> 01:51:04.613
... you've been the best to me

01:51:10.424 --> 01:51:11.823
I'm already missing you

01:51:20.704 --> 01:51:22.023
Why won't you come with me?

01:51:28.424 --> 01:51:29.379
Didn't you...

01:51:31.664 --> 01:51:33.143
...promise not to ask?

01:51:39.024 --> 01:51:40.980
Hold me

01:51:44.064 --> 01:51:45.736
It may be years before we meet again

01:52:33.944 --> 01:52:35.741
The night we Last saw each
other for the Last time...

01:52:35.984 --> 01:52:37.542
...I told her...

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:39.183
Take care

01:52:41.544 --> 01:52:43.216
Maybe one day you’ll escape your past

01:52:45.624 --> 01:52:47.216
If you do. Look for me

01:54:11.384 --> 01:54:12.100
Now it strikes me...

01:54:12.984 --> 01:54:15.054
...that what I told her was
actually meant for myself

01:54:17.904 --> 01:54:19.542
In Love. you can't bring
on a substitute

01:54:21.224 --> 01:54:23.784
I was looking for what
I'd felt with the other Su Li zhen

01:54:26.264 --> 01:54:27.458
I didn't realize that myself

01:54:29.184 --> 01:54:30.412
But I'm sure she did

01:54:56.664 --> 01:54:58.495
All for me?
You want to get me drunk?

01:54:59.024 --> 01:54:59.979
I know you're a good drinker

01:55:01.224 --> 01:55:02.896
Let's drink!

01:55:03.544 --> 01:55:04.613
As much as we can!

01:55:06.184 --> 01:55:07.663
If there's any Left over...

01:55:08.944 --> 01:55:11.299
...finish it next time you're here

01:55:21.464 --> 01:55:22.658
One small thing I have to ask you

01:55:23.544 --> 01:55:24.772
Here's some money. please take it

01:55:26.144 --> 01:55:26.781
What for?

01:55:28.504 --> 01:55:31.462
I know you borrowed from
a friend for my plane ticket

01:55:33.384 --> 01:55:34.453
Pay him back

01:55:35.264 --> 01:55:37.858
If there's any Left
pay my rent for me

01:55:41.584 --> 01:55:42.733
Where did you get so much money?

01:55:45.904 --> 01:55:47.019
An old customer

01:55:48.224 --> 01:55:50.863
He's always been fond of me

01:55:51.744 --> 01:55:52.733
He treats me well

01:55:54.264 --> 01:55:57.336
But he's too old for me
so I never paid him much attention

01:56:01.664 --> 01:56:03.143
I ran into him yesterday
while I was shopping

01:56:04.744 --> 01:56:05.972
He insisted on buying me dinner

01:56:10.464 --> 01:56:11.658
I needed money

01:56:12.624 --> 01:56:13.613
So I went

01:56:16.744 --> 01:56:19.702
After dinner
I told him I needed money

01:56:22.464 --> 01:56:25.456
He said I could have
as much as I wanted

01:56:31.064 --> 01:56:32.292
I told him I needed $5.000

01:56:36.624 --> 01:56:38.455
At first
I planned to save it for Singapore

01:56:42.104 --> 01:56:43.093
But I'm using it now

01:56:49.184 --> 01:56:50.253
Don't be silly

01:56:51.304 --> 01:56:54.694
You're still young
You have great prospects

01:56:56.864 --> 01:56:58.343
I borrowed the money
from my friends

01:56:59.184 --> 01:57:00.378
They don't need it back yet

01:57:02.624 --> 01:57:04.819
So keep this for yourself

01:57:09.384 --> 01:57:10.578
Pay me back Later
there's no rush

01:57:15.984 --> 01:57:17.258
Why are you so kind to me?

01:57:19.504 --> 01:57:20.698
Perhaps It's fate

01:57:30.584 --> 01:57:31.937
Too bad it didn't Last

01:57:34.624 --> 01:57:35.818
I wish it could have gone on Longer

01:57:39.424 --> 01:57:40.459
Don't be Like this

01:57:41.664 --> 01:57:42.540
Let me buy you dinner tonight

01:57:44.344 --> 01:57:46.221
Waiter. the check!
Coming

01:57:46.984 --> 01:57:47.939
No. Let me

01:57:49.824 --> 01:57:51.257
You're too kind

01:57:53.144 --> 01:57:55.578
You've spent enough time
and money on me already

01:57:57.504 --> 01:57:58.732
I don't want to owe you too much

01:58:06.624 --> 01:58:08.023
I need to make a phone call

01:58:09.264 --> 01:58:11.539
Please settle the check
I'll be outside

01:59:14.384 --> 01:59:15.897
Will you come in?

01:59:17.064 --> 01:59:17.940
No. thanks

01:59:19.104 --> 01:59:19.980
Get some rest

01:59:21.304 --> 01:59:22.339
I'll see you to the
airport tomorrow

01:59:24.664 --> 01:59:25.414
Please don't

01:59:26.944 --> 01:59:28.172
I'll be terribly sad if
you're there

01:59:33.424 --> 01:59:34.539
Take good care of yourself

01:59:51.384 --> 01:59:53.215
Why can't it be Like
it was before?

01:59:57.064 --> 01:59:58.383
Please don't go

02:00:00.464 --> 02:00:01.897
Stay with me tonight

02:00:06.704 --> 02:00:07.898
Let me borrow you

02:00:09.904 --> 02:00:10.814
Do you remember?

02:00:13.224 --> 02:00:14.213
You once asked me...

02:00:15.424 --> 02:00:16.743
...if there was anything
I wouldn’t lend

02:00:19.224 --> 02:00:20.452
I've given it a lot of thought

02:00:23.264 --> 02:00:24.140
And now I know...

02:00:26.944 --> 02:00:28.059
...there is one thing...

02:00:31.904 --> 02:00:33.656
...I'll never I end to anyone

02:01:21.024 --> 02:01:22.298
As I recall...

02:01:22.704 --> 02:01:24.774
...that was the very Last
time we saw each other

02:01:26.144 --> 02:01:28.612
I haven't seen her since that night

02:01:42.184 --> 02:01:45.972
Why can't it be Like it was before?

02:01:53.344 --> 02:01:55.380
He didn't turn back

02:01:56.344 --> 02:01:58.904
It was as if he'd boarded
a very Long train

02:01:59.624 --> 02:02:01.933
Heading for a drowsy future...

02:02:02.624 --> 02:02:04.854
.. through the unfathomable night

02:02:07.704 --> 02:02:10.377
Everyone who goes to 2046
has the same intention

02:02:11.784 --> 02:02:13.502
They want to recapture Lost memories

02:02:14.984 --> 02:02:17.134
Because in 2046...

02:02:17.464 --> 02:02:19.694
...nothing ever changes

02:02:20.384 --> 02:02:22.295
But nobody really knows
if that's true or not

02:02:23.944 --> 02:02:27.141
Because nobody has ever come back
