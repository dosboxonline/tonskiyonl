01:05.608 --> 01:08.987
<i>This is a story of boy meets girl.</i>

01:13.199 --> 01:16.745
<i>The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey,</i>

01:16.828 --> 01:19.664
<i>grew up believing that
he'd never truly be happy...</i>

01:19.748 --> 01:21.875
<i>until the day he met "the one."</i>

01:21.958 --> 01:27.213
<i>This belief stemmed from early exposure
to sad British pop music...</i>

01:27.297 --> 01:29.674
<i>and a total misreading
of the movie</i> The Graduate.

01:29.758 --> 01:32.093
<i>Elaine! Elaine!</i>

01:32.177 --> 01:35.180
<i>The girl, Summer Finn
of Shinnecock, Michigan,</i>

01:35.263 --> 01:37.515
<i>did not share this belief.</i>

01:37.599 --> 01:41.144
<i>Since the disintegration
of her parents' marriage,</i>

01:41.227 --> 01:43.480
<i>she'd only loved two things.</i>

01:43.563 --> 01:46.691
<i>The first was her long, dark hair.</i>

01:46.775 --> 01:49.861
<i>The second was how easily
she could cut it off...</i>

01:49.944 --> 01:51.905
<i>and feel nothing.</i>

01:52.989 --> 01:56.284
<i>Tom meets Summer on January 8.</i>

01:56.367 --> 02:00.622
<i>He knows almost immediately
she's who he's been searching for.</i>

02:01.915 --> 02:05.168
<i>This is a story of boy meets girl.</i>

02:06.211 --> 02:08.296
<i>But you should know up front,</i>

02:08.379 --> 02:10.381

We didn't know
who else to call.

04:22.347 --> 04:24.474
It's Amanda Heller
all over again.

04:24.557 --> 04:26.517
You did the right thing.

04:27.894 --> 04:31.522
Now, where is he?

04:37.278 --> 04:39.280
<i>Thomas.</i>

04:40.490 --> 04:43.284
Rachel.
What are you doing here?

04:43.409 --> 04:45.870
I'm here to help you.
Help me how?

04:45.954 --> 04:48.206
First, put down the plate.

04:49.916 --> 04:51.668
Drink this.

04:53.002 --> 04:55.129
<i>- What is that?</i>
- Vodka.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.423
Um, does Mom know
that you're here?

04:57.548 --> 05:01.010
'Cause it's probably past 10:00.
Don't worry about it.

05:01.094 --> 05:05.765
Just start from the beginning,
and tell us what happened.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.518
<i>Things were going so well.</i>

05:20.154 --> 05:22.615
Then what?

05:22.699 --> 05:24.826
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

05:24.951 --> 05:27.078
Just like that?
Just like that.

05:27.161 --> 05:30.999
- Did she say why?
- I mean, this thing— what are we doing?

05:31.082 --> 05:33.167
I mean, is this normal?

05:33.251 --> 05:36.212
Norm— I— I don't know. I don't care.
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?

05:36.337 --> 05:38.006
You're happy?
You're not?

05:38.131 --> 05:40.925
All we do is argue.
That is bullshit.

05:41.009 --> 05:42.593
Maybe she was just
in a bad mood.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.679
Yeah, maybe like
a— a hormonal thing.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.390
- P.M.S.?
- What do you know about P.M.S.?

05:47.473 --> 05:50.810
- More than you, Tom.
- Then what happened?

05:50.893 --> 05:52.895
<i>This can't come as
a total surprise to you.</i>

05:52.979 --> 05:55.398
I mean, we've been
like Sid and Nancy
for months now.

05:55.481 --> 05:59.360
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy...
seven times with a kitchen knife.

05:59.444 --> 06:04.741
I— I mean, we have some disagreements,
but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.

06:04.824 --> 06:07.910
No. I'm Sid.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.246
Oh, so I'm Nancy?

06:14.333 --> 06:17.879
Let's just eat,
and we'll talk about it later.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.715
Mmm. That is good.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.384
I'm really glad we did this.

06:23.468 --> 06:25.595
I love these pancakes.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.432
What?

06:29.515 --> 06:33.144
Tom, don't go.
You're still my best friend!

06:34.812 --> 06:36.898
- Jesus.
- You've broken up with girls before.

06:36.981 --> 06:38.566
Yes.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.401
And girls have broken up
with you before.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.694
This is different.
Why?

06:41.778 --> 06:42.820
'Cause it's Summer.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.698
So you'll— you'll
meet somebody new.

06:45.782 --> 06:48.785
Point is, you're
the best guy I know.
You'll get over her.

06:48.868 --> 06:51.537
<i>I think it's kind of like how they say.
There's, uh—</i>

06:51.621 --> 06:53.539
There's plenty of other
fish in the sea.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.084
No.
They— They say that.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.169
Well, they're lying.

06:59.504 --> 07:01.839
I don't want to get over her.

07:03.049 --> 07:05.343
I want to get her back.

07:05.510 --> 07:08.930
<i>Maybe playing it safe
is the wrong approach.</i>

07:09.013 --> 07:10.932
<i>The nuclear family is dead,</i>

07:11.015 --> 07:13.726
<i>and we need a new holiday
that recognizes that.</i>

07:13.810 --> 07:15.812
May 21 st.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.399
Other <i>Mother's Day.</i>

07:21.818 --> 07:23.986
Thank you.

07:24.070 --> 07:27.448
I'd say we've got
some potential here.
What do you think, Hansen?

07:27.532 --> 07:30.368
Could you write up some
prototypes for these?

07:30.451 --> 07:33.121
Uh, Mr. Vance,
there's a telephone call
for you on line three.

07:33.204 --> 07:37.834
Oh. Thank you.
Uh, everyone, this is Summer,
my new assistant.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.169
Summer just moved here from—

07:40.294 --> 07:42.755
Michigan.
Right. Michigan. Right.

07:42.839 --> 07:45.133
Uh, Summer, everyone.

07:45.216 --> 07:48.302
Everyone, Summer.
Excuse me. I have to take this.

07:49.679 --> 07:52.181
It's nice to meet you all.

07:52.265 --> 07:56.144
<i>There's only two kinds
of people in the world.</i>

07:56.227 --> 07:58.354
<i>There's women, and there's men.</i>

08:00.064 --> 08:02.650
<i>Summer Finn was a woman.</i>

08:02.733 --> 08:06.404
<i>Height, average. Weight, average.</i>

08:06.487 --> 08:09.490
<i>Shoe size, slightly above average.</i>

08:09.574 --> 08:11.576
<i>For all intents and purposes,</i>

08:11.659 --> 08:14.704
<i>Summer Finn, just another girl.</i>

08:14.787 --> 08:16.706
<i>Except she wasn't.</i>

08:16.789 --> 08:19.250
<i>To wit, in 1998,</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:22.253
<i>Summer quoted a song
by the Scottish band
Belle and Sebastian...</i>

08:22.336 --> 08:24.255
<i>in her high school yearbook.</i>

08:24.338 --> 08:26.966
<i>"Color my life
with the chaos of trouble."</i>

08:27.049 --> 08:28.926
<i>This spike in Michigan
sales of their album...</i>

08:29.010 --> 08:31.179
The Boy with the Arab Strap...

08:31.262 --> 08:33.681
<i>continues to puzzle industry analysts.</i>

08:33.764 --> 08:37.685
<i>Summer's employment
at the Daily Freeze
during her sophomore year...</i>

08:37.768 --> 08:41.689
<i>coincided with an inexplicable
212% increase in revenue.</i>

08:42.940 --> 08:45.026
<i>Every apartment Summer rented...</i>

08:45.109 --> 08:49.906
<i>was offered at an average rate
of 9.2% below market value.</i>

08:49.989 --> 08:52.491
<i>And her round-trip commute to work...</i>

08:52.575 --> 08:56.078
<i>averaged 18.4 double takes per day.</i>

08:56.162 --> 08:58.915
<i>It was a rare quality,
this "Summer effect."</i>

08:58.998 --> 09:03.002
<i>Rare, and yet something
every postadolescent male
has encountered...</i>

09:03.085 --> 09:05.004
<i>at least once in their lives.</i>

09:05.087 --> 09:09.175

<i>91,000 commercial buildings
and 3.8 million people—</i>

09:13.804 --> 09:17.058
<i>well, that could only

09:22.647 --> 09:24.857
<i>Dude, I hear she's a bitch.</i>

09:24.941 --> 09:26.692
Really?

09:26.776 --> 09:29.856
Yeah. Patel tried to talk
to her in the copy room.
She's totally not having it.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.530
Maybe she was just in a hurry.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.367
And maybe she's an uppity,
"better than everyone" superskank.

09:36.452 --> 09:39.705
Damn.
I know.
She's pretty hot.

09:39.789 --> 09:41.832
That sucks.
Why is it pretty girls...

09:41.916 --> 09:44.335
think they can treat people like crap
and get away with it?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.504
Centuries of reinforcement.

09:46.587 --> 09:50.091
You know what? Screw her.
I don't care.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.593
If she wants to be that way, fine.

Mm-hmm.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.603
Saturday.
Oh, wow.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.105
And, uh, what brought you?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.567
Boredom mostly.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.195
Wanted to try something

11:43.329 --> 11:46.332
Wow. You've...

11:46.457 --> 11:48.626
always wanted to write
greeting cards?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.628
No, I don't even
want to do it now.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.963
Well, you should
do something else then.

11:53.047 --> 11:56.258
Yeah. I studied to be
an architect, actually.

11:56.342 --> 11:59.345
You did? That's cool.
What happened there?

12:00.596 --> 12:02.515
It didn't work out.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.476
I needed a job, and here we are.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.144
You any good?

12:07.228 --> 12:10.606
Well, um, I wrote this one.

12:20.616 --> 12:23.119
Yeah.

12:23.244 --> 12:25.329
I doubt it.
Well,

12:25.413 --> 12:28.374
you're a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.168
Thank you. That was actually
my nickname in college.

12:31.252 --> 12:33.170
They called me
"Perfectly Adequate" Hansen.

12:33.254 --> 12:35.172
They used to call me Anal Girl.

12:38.843 --> 12:42.179
I was very neat and organized.

12:45.558 --> 12:48.477
Well, I should get back, so—
Uh—

12:48.561 --> 12:50.646
All right. See you later.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.320
This is not good.

14:23.614 --> 14:26.450
<i>She likes Magritte</i> and <i>Hopper.</i>

14:26.534 --> 14:29.036
And we talked
about <i>Bananafish</i>
for like 20 minutes.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.080
We're so compatible,
it's insane.

14:31.163 --> 14:34.458
She's— Well, she's not
like I thought at all.
She's amazing.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.086
<i>Oh, boy.
What?</i>

14:37.169 --> 14:41.924
Just 'cause some
cute girl likes the same
bizarro crap you do,

14:42.007 --> 14:44.009
that doesn't make her
your soul mate, Tom.

14:44.093 --> 14:46.971

What do you mean?

14:48.389 --> 14:50.432
<i>- It's off.</i>
- What?

14:50.516 --> 14:52.434
- Me and Summer.
- Was it ever on?

14:52.518 --> 14:55.688
No, but it could have been,
in a world where
good things happen to me.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.898
- Yeah, well, that's not
really where we live.
- No.

14:57.982 --> 15:00.109
Lucky.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.695
So, what happened?

15:02.820 --> 15:04.738
All right. You ready?
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:04.822 --> 15:07.783
So there we are.
Nine more floors to ride,
just me and her.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.868
Hey, Summer.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.954
Hi.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.457
How was your weekend?

15:15.541 --> 15:17.459
It was good.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.295
Can you believe that shit?

15:19.378 --> 15:21.380
I'm sorry. What shit?

15:21.463 --> 15:25.301
- I think I missed something.
- She said, "It was good."
Emphasis on the "good."

15:25.384 --> 15:28.887
She basically said she spent
the weekend having sex with
some guy she met at the gym.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.056
Skank. Whatever.
I'm over it.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.976
What the hell
is wrong with you?
She's not interested in me.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.936
There's really nothing
I can do about that.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.397
Just because
she said it was good?
And some other things.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.691
<i>Like, did she say, uh,
"hey" instead of "hi"?</i>

15:40.774 --> 15:44.737
I mean, 'cause you know
that that— that means
that she's a lesbian, right?

15:44.820 --> 15:46.905
I gave her plenty of chances.

15:46.989 --> 15:50.659
I'm going to the supply room.
Do you guys need anything?

15:50.743 --> 15:53.412
I think you know what I need.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.043
Uh, toner.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.613

17:09.697 --> 17:12.700

on the stage, you tried to

17:12.783 --> 17:14.660
and you threatened to
burn the place down.

17:14.785 --> 17:17.538

It's a work thing.

You're not listening to me.

Hi.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.801
I didn't, uh— I didn't know
you were gonna join us.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.053
I would have gotten you,
you know, a drink, or—

18:56.178 --> 18:58.055
I'm good.
You're good?

18:58.180 --> 19:01.225
You— You were great—
great up, uh, singing.
Thank you.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.602
I wanted to sing "Born To Run,"
but they didn't have it.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.646
I love "Born To Run."
<i>Me too.</i>

19:05.729 --> 19:08.106
Tom's from New Jersey.
<i>Really?</i>

19:08.190 --> 19:10.984
Yeah. I grew up there.
Uh, I lived there till I was 12.

19:11.068 --> 19:12.903
I named my cat
after Springsteen.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.905
No kidding.
What-What was his name?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.949
Bruce.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.575
Oh.
That makes sense.

19:21.245 --> 19:23.247
So, do you have a boyfriend?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.249
- No.
- Why not?

19:25.332 --> 19:28.752
- 'Cause I don't want one.
- Come on. I don't believe that.

19:28.836 --> 19:31.797
You don't believe
that a woman could enjoy
being free and independent?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.841
Are you a lesbian?

19:33.924 --> 19:36.051
No, I'm not a lesbian.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.345
I just don't feel comfortable
being anyone's girlfriend.

19:38.428 --> 19:42.057
I don't actually feel
comfortable being anyone's
anything, you know.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.601
<i>- I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>
- Really?

19:44.685 --> 19:46.687
Nope.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.772
Okay. Let me
break it down for you.

19:48.856 --> 19:53.026
- Break it down.
- Okay. I like being on my own.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.154
Relationships are messy,
and people's feelings get hurt.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.407
Who needs it? We're young.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.951
We live in one of
the most beautiful
cities in the world.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.287
Might as well have fun
while we can and...

20:03.370 --> 20:05.706
save the serious stuff for later.

20:05.789 --> 20:09.042
Holy shit. You're a dude.
She's a dude.

20:09.126 --> 20:13.171
Okay. But wait, wait.
What happens if you fall in love?

20:13.297 --> 20:15.215
What?

20:15.299 --> 20:17.259
Well, you don't
believe that, do you?

20:17.342 --> 20:19.636
It's love.
It's not Santa Claus.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.638
Well, what does
that word even mean?

20:21.722 --> 20:24.766
I've been in relationships,
and I don't think I've ever seen it.

20:24.892 --> 20:28.020
Well, maybe that's—
And most marriages end
in divorce these days.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.397
Like my parents.
Okay. Mine too, but—

20:30.480 --> 20:33.191
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.486
The lady dothn't.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.615
There's no such thing as love.
It's a fantasy.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.326
Well, I think you're wrong.

20:44.161 --> 20:46.496
Okay. Well,

20:46.580 --> 20:49.124
what is it that
I'm missing then?

20:51.293 --> 20:53.629
I think you know it
when you feel it.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.343
I guess we can just
agree to disagree.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.764
Yeah.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.475
Okay. Who's singing next?

21:06.558 --> 21:09.269
I nominate
Young Werther here.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.480

that guy and singing.

Yeah.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.987
Yeah, of course I like you.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.035
Right. As friends.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.996

23:33.080 --> 23:37.501

I hadn't really thought about, um—

23:37.584 --> 23:39.878
Yes. Why?

23:39.961 --> 23:43.256
No reason. I just—

23:43.340 --> 23:47.844

and I'd like for us to be friends.

Good night.

24:35.267 --> 24:38.103

- Hi.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.592
So, that was fun
the other night.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.883
You son of a bitch.
Shh!

25:50.008 --> 25:52.987
The same girl you've been
obsessing over for weeks now?
I've not been obsessing.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.615
The girl you said was out
of your league, that you'd
never have a chance with.

25:55.639 --> 25:56.681
That girl.
Paul, seriously.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.266
Did you bang her?
No.

25:58.391 --> 26:01.144
What, hum job?
Hand job?
Man, no.

26:01.228 --> 26:05.732
No jobs. I'm still unemployed.
We— We kissed.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.568
Level with me, man. Come on.
This is your best friend, huh?

26:08.652 --> 26:12.113
Your best friend who tolerated
you whining about this girl
for weeks on end.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.382
Paul—
You were essentially
stalking her!

26:13.406 --> 26:15.158
Paul! Shh!

26:19.246 --> 26:21.748
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:21.831 --> 26:24.125
I'm Summer.
Summer.

26:24.209 --> 26:27.504
I'm Paul.
Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you.

26:31.549 --> 26:35.262
Well, I gotta go.
I gotta do some, you know.

26:35.387 --> 26:38.390
Yeah, man.
<i>Um, pretend
I was never here.</i>

26:38.473 --> 26:41.226
Oh, wait! Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
Um, if any jobs come up—

26:41.309 --> 26:43.645
Thanks, Paul! See ya!

26:46.481 --> 26:51.278
He's, uh, you know,
an old friend.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.571
If you heard any of, um—

26:53.697 --> 26:56.074
Heard what?
Nothing. You wanna go?

26:56.157 --> 26:58.827
Yeah. I'm stalking.
I mean, I'm starving.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.667
Ah, hon?

27:05.750 --> 27:07.711
Our sink is broken.

27:12.090 --> 27:15.385
Man, all of our sinks
are broken.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.728
<i>What are we looking for again?</i>

27:24.811 --> 27:26.980
Uh, trivets.
How 'bout a <i>flygel?</i>

27:27.063 --> 27:29.107
No, I don't think so.

27:29.232 --> 27:32.193
No? You don't
want a <i>flygel?</i>

27:32.277 --> 27:34.279

27:36.740 --> 27:40.368

is lovely, isn't it?

27:40.452 --> 27:42.370
Yes.

27:42.454 --> 27:44.581
Ooh! <i>Idol's</i> on.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.632
The TV's not working.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.968
Oh.

27:57.052 --> 28:00.764
Well, I'm famished.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.766
Let's eat.

28:07.896 --> 28:09.856
Mmm. Smells delicious.

28:09.939 --> 28:13.943
Oh, honey, that's because
it is delicious.

28:15.028 --> 28:17.072
I made it myself.

28:17.155 --> 28:19.449
Bald eagle.
Your favorite.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.951
Mm-hmm.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.626
The sink's broken.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.836
Well, that's okay, because...

28:34.047 --> 28:36.508
that's why we bought a home
with two kitchens.

28:36.591 --> 28:38.885

29:05.161 --> 29:09.374
but... there's a Chinese family
in our bathroom.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.811
This is fun.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.522
You're fun.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.524
Thanks.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.030
Hey, um,

29:41.114 --> 29:44.367
I just wanna tell you
that, um,

29:44.451 --> 29:47.537
I'm not really looking...

29:47.620 --> 29:51.249
for anything... serious.

29:54.002 --> 29:56.713
Is that okay?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.715
Yeah.

30:01.259 --> 30:03.928
'Cause some people
kind of freak out
when they hear that.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.514
No, not me.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.975
You sure?

30:09.058 --> 30:12.979
Yeah. Like, casual.
Right? Take it slow.

30:13.062 --> 30:15.023
Right.

30:15.106 --> 30:17.108
No pressure.

30:50.475 --> 30:52.810
Can you, uh—
Can you wait one second?

31:00.527 --> 31:04.197
Okay. Settle.
She's just a girl.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.241
Just a girl.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.952
She wants to keep it casual,

31:09.035 --> 31:11.538
which is why she's
in my bed right now.

31:11.621 --> 31:14.249
But that's casual.
That's what casual people do.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.127
That's fine. That's great.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.150
Is this Solitaire?

33:46.234 --> 33:48.820
So, did you get her back
yet or what?

33:51.572 --> 33:53.574
Working on it.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.956
<i>Hey, maybe you should
write a book.</i>
What?

34:00.039 --> 34:02.834
Well, you know, Henry Miller
said the best way
to get over a woman...

34:02.917 --> 34:04.877
is to turn her into literature.

34:04.961 --> 34:07.797
Well, that guy had
a lot more sex than me.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.262
Oh, this is it! This is it!

34:14.345 --> 34:16.347

Yeah, that's it. That is it.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.582

34:42.665 --> 34:45.168
<i>Can you just be serious,
for just a second?</i>

34:45.293 --> 34:47.378
I am being totally serious.
No, you're joking around.

34:47.503 --> 34:50.131
No, I am not joking around.
"Octopus's Garden"?

34:50.214 --> 34:52.842
Yes, "Octopus's Garden"
is the best Beatles song
ever recorded.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.719
Why don't you just say "Piggies"?

34:54.802 --> 34:56.804
Come on. I love Ringo Starr!

34:56.929 --> 35:00.600
Nobody loves Ringo Starr.
That's what
I love about him.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.854
No, no.

35:07.482 --> 35:10.026
<i>Ooh, this looks good.</i>

35:10.109 --> 35:12.403
<i>Gets really good reviews.</i>

35:15.865 --> 35:20.119
You know what?
That looks pretty doable.

35:20.244 --> 35:23.122
Why are you
asking me now?
Because this was your idea.

35:25.208 --> 35:27.168
Put your hand there.
Wait one second.

35:27.293 --> 35:31.422
Okay.

36:16.509 --> 36:18.803
Right here.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.806
How come?

36:21.889 --> 36:25.017
Uh, I don't know.
It's kind of hard to explain,
I guess.

36:25.101 --> 36:27.854
Well, try.

36:27.937 --> 36:30.690
Um— Well, okay.

36:30.773 --> 36:34.569
Like, that building— that's, uh—

36:34.652 --> 36:37.363
That's been there since 1911.

36:37.446 --> 36:40.575
And that— that's the Continental.
That's L.A.'s first skyscraper.

36:40.658 --> 36:43.035
It was built in 1904.

36:43.119 --> 36:44.829
What is that?

36:44.912 --> 36:46.914
That?

36:47.039 --> 36:50.084
That's a parking lot.
Oh!

36:50.167 --> 36:53.629
Yeah. That's—
That's also a parking lot.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.383
That's, um— Yeah.

36:57.466 --> 37:00.011
There's a lot of beautiful
stuff here too though.

37:03.014 --> 37:07.143
I don't know.
I just... wish people
would notice it more.

37:07.226 --> 37:11.147
If it were me, then, uh—

37:11.230 --> 37:13.566
If it were you what?

37:13.649 --> 37:16.736
I don't know. I think
I'd... make 'em notice.

37:17.737 --> 37:20.072
How would you
make them notice?

37:22.491 --> 37:26.162
I don't know.
There's a lot of different
stuff you could do.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.706
Show me.

37:28.831 --> 37:32.418
Please. I don't know
anything about architecture.

37:32.543 --> 37:35.254
You want me to
draw you something?
Yeah.

37:35.379 --> 37:38.799
I don't have any paper.
Well, use my arm.

37:41.010 --> 37:42.970
Please, I need a tattoo.

37:43.095 --> 37:46.682
Well, let's see your arm.
That's the spirit.

37:49.310 --> 37:53.272
Well, the buildings need
to be integrated better, so—

37:53.356 --> 37:56.275
You could maximize
light capacity here.

38:20.675 --> 38:22.677
It's kind of messy.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.762
That's okay.

38:36.524 --> 38:40.820
<i>For Tom Hansen, this was the night
where everything changed.</i>

38:40.903 --> 38:44.240
<i>That wall Summer
so often hid behind—</i>

38:44.323 --> 38:47.910
<i>the wall of distance, of space, of casual—</i>

38:49.286 --> 38:52.164
<i>that wall was slowly coming down.</i>

38:53.582 --> 38:55.960
<i>For here was Tom, in her world,</i>

38:56.043 --> 39:00.464
<i>a place few had been invited
to see with their own eyes.</i>

39:00.548 --> 39:02.800
<i>And here was Summer,
wanting him there.</i>

39:02.883 --> 39:05.636
<i>Him, no one else.</i>

39:05.720 --> 39:07.888
Have you ever been
in a tornado?
No.

39:08.014 --> 39:11.767
It's that and
my teeth falling out.

39:11.851 --> 39:13.769
I have that too!
You do?

39:13.853 --> 39:17.231
Yeah! It's so weird.
It's like being an old man.

39:17.314 --> 39:20.067
What else do you have?

39:20.151 --> 39:22.194
Um, earthquakes?

39:22.278 --> 39:24.530
Really?
No.

39:27.408 --> 39:32.246
<i>You know, I dream
sometimes about flying.</i>

39:32.329 --> 39:35.332
<i>It starts out like I'm running
really, really fast.</i>

39:35.416 --> 39:37.334
<i>I'm, like, superhuman.</i>

39:37.418 --> 39:40.713
<i>And the terrain starts to get
really rocky and steep.</i>

39:40.796 --> 39:44.592
<i>And then I'm running so fast
that my feet aren't even
touching the ground.</i>

39:44.675 --> 39:49.305
<i>And I'm floating,
and it's like this amazing,
amazing realness.</i>

39:50.890 --> 39:53.142
<i>I'm free. I'm safe.</i>

39:53.225 --> 39:56.062
<i>Then I realize,</i>

39:56.145 --> 39:58.814
<i>I'm completely alone.</i>

40:01.776 --> 40:04.236
And then I wake up.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.360
<i>As he listened, Tom began to realize...</i>

40:06.405 --> 40:09.825
<i>that these weren't stories
routinely told.</i>

40:09.950 --> 40:13.287
<i>These were stories
one had to earn.</i>

40:13.370 --> 40:16.373
<i>He could feel the wall coming down.</i>

40:16.457 --> 40:19.752
<i>He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.</i>

40:19.835 --> 40:23.839
<i>Which is why the next six words
changed everything.</i>

40:23.923 --> 40:26.926
I've never told anybody
that before.

40:31.013 --> 40:33.015
I guess I'm not just anybody.

40:33.099 --> 40:35.559
So what are you exactly?

40:35.684 --> 40:37.645
I don't know.
Are you her boyfriend?

40:37.728 --> 40:39.939
It's not that simple.
Sure, it is.

40:40.022 --> 40:42.149
What, like,
are we going steady?
Come on, guys.

40:42.233 --> 40:44.860
You know, we're— we're adults.
We know how we feel.

40:44.944 --> 40:46.946
We don't need
to put labels on it.

40:47.029 --> 40:48.948
I mean,
"boyfriend," "girlfriend."

40:49.031 --> 40:52.535
All that stuff is—
It's really juvenile.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.079
You sound gay.
You really do.

40:55.162 --> 40:57.081
Okay, first of all,

40:57.164 --> 41:01.127
your last girlfriend
was Amy Sussman
in the seventh grade,

41:01.210 --> 41:03.921
and you dated
for, like, three hours.

41:04.004 --> 41:08.926
And you—
you've been with Robyn
since what— like 1998?

41:09.051 --> 41:11.428
'97.
'97. See—

41:11.554 --> 41:14.306
Shoot.

41:14.390 --> 41:18.644
I don't think the two of you
are exactly authorities
on modern relationships.

41:24.608 --> 41:27.319
So, what should I do?
You should ask her.

41:27.403 --> 41:29.321
What?

41:29.405 --> 41:32.032
Well, why rock the boat,
is what I'm thinking.

41:32.116 --> 41:34.118
I mean,
things are going well.

41:34.201 --> 41:36.745
You start putting labels on it,
that's like the kiss of death.

41:36.871 --> 41:40.666
It's like saying, "I love you."
Yeah, I know what you mean.

41:40.749 --> 41:43.627
That's what happened
between me and Sean.

41:43.752 --> 41:46.338
Who the hell's Sean?
My boyfriend
before Mark.

41:46.422 --> 41:48.716
Who the— Never mind.

41:48.841 --> 41:52.636
So, what you're saying—
I'm saying you do
want to ask her.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.848
It's obvious.
You're just afraid you'll get
an answer you don't want,

41:55.931 --> 42:00.019
which will shatter
all the illusions of how great
these past few months have been.

42:00.102 --> 42:02.021
Now look, if it were me,

42:02.104 --> 42:04.565
I'd find out now before you
show up at her place...

42:04.648 --> 42:08.652
and, well, she's in bed
with Lars from Norway.

42:08.736 --> 42:11.530
Who's Lars from Norway?

42:11.614 --> 42:13.532
Just some guy
she met at the gym...

42:13.616 --> 42:17.119
with Brad Pitt's face
and Jesus' abs.

42:19.121 --> 42:21.582
Wait! No, Coach.
We're not done here.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.709
Rachel!
Look, it's easy, Tom.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.794
Just don't be a pussy.

42:42.811 --> 42:45.189
You okay?

42:45.314 --> 42:48.400
Yeah.
You sure?

42:48.484 --> 42:51.111
Summer,
I gotta ask you something.

42:51.237 --> 42:53.239
What?
What are we, um—

42:55.282 --> 42:58.077
What are we doing?
I thought we were going
to the movies.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.579
Yeah. Nah, I mean, like,
what are we, like—

43:00.663 --> 43:03.290
What's going on here, with us?

43:03.374 --> 43:05.334
I don't know.

43:06.710 --> 43:08.837
Who cares?

43:08.963 --> 43:11.966
I'm happy.
Aren't you happy?
Yeah.

43:12.049 --> 43:13.968
Good.

43:49.837 --> 43:51.839
<i>London, 1964.</i>

43:51.922 --> 43:53.882
Those girls knew how to dress.

43:53.966 --> 43:57.553
Nowadays, it's all
these giant sunglasses...

43:57.636 --> 43:59.888
and tattoos.

43:59.972 --> 44:02.182
It's handbags with
little dogs in them.

44:02.266 --> 44:06.270
Who okayed this?
Some people like it.

44:08.022 --> 44:10.065
I like how you dress.

44:10.149 --> 44:13.694
I was thinking about
getting a butterfly tattoo
about yea big on my ankle.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.779
No.

44:15.863 --> 44:17.573
Oh.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.908
Yo.

44:19.992 --> 44:21.910
How's it going?

44:21.994 --> 44:24.163
Uh, okay.

44:24.246 --> 44:26.498
You live around here?

44:26.582 --> 44:28.751
Um, yeah, not too far.

44:28.834 --> 44:31.128
I've never
seen you here before.

44:31.211 --> 44:33.339
You're not too observant.

44:33.422 --> 44:36.425
That's funny. You're funny.

44:36.550 --> 44:39.053
So let me buy you a drink.
No, thank you.

44:41.263 --> 44:43.390
You with this guy?
Hey, I'm Tom.

44:43.474 --> 44:46.060
Whatever.
So, come on. One drink.
What are you drinking?

44:46.143 --> 44:48.312
I said no, thanks.

44:48.395 --> 44:50.272
You're serious? This guy?

44:50.397 --> 44:52.358
Hey, buddy—
You know what?
Don't be rude.

44:52.441 --> 44:54.485
I'm flattered,
but I'm not interested.

44:54.568 --> 44:58.530
So why don't you go over there
and leave us alone? Thanks.

45:00.532 --> 45:02.534
It's a free country.

45:11.585 --> 45:14.755
I can't believe
this is your boyfriend.

45:21.637 --> 45:23.764
What are you doing?

45:25.849 --> 45:28.852
It was really just a crazy thing.

45:28.936 --> 45:32.272
It happened like—
It felt like it happened
fast, but really,

45:32.356 --> 45:35.442
it— it also felt like it
was happening really slowly,

45:35.526 --> 45:37.486
like everything all was just—

45:37.611 --> 45:41.240
I don't know. It doesn't
feel like you think it would—

45:41.323 --> 45:44.034
Hey, what's the matter?

45:44.118 --> 45:47.037
I just— I can't believe you.

45:47.121 --> 45:49.373
You can't believe <i>me?</i>

45:49.456 --> 45:52.167
You were so completely,
completely uncool in there.

45:52.251 --> 45:56.338
Wait. Are you mad at me?
I just got my ass kicked for you.

45:56.422 --> 45:58.715
Oh, really? Was that for me?
Was that for my benefit?

45:58.799 --> 46:00.426
Yes, it was.

46:00.509 --> 46:02.886
Okay, well, next time don't,
'cause I don't need your help.

46:02.970 --> 46:06.432
You know what?
I'm really tired.

46:09.059 --> 46:11.437
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

46:24.324 --> 46:26.285
No. You know what?

46:26.368 --> 46:29.788
I'm not going anywhere
till you tell me what's going on.

46:29.872 --> 46:31.874
Nothing's going on.

46:34.001 --> 46:35.919
We're just—

46:37.129 --> 46:40.257
What? We're just what?

46:40.382 --> 46:44.136
We're just friends.
No! Don't pull that with me!

46:44.219 --> 46:46.221
Don't even try to—

46:46.305 --> 46:49.683
This is not how
you treat your friend.

46:49.766 --> 46:53.812
Kissing in the copy room?
Holding hands in IKEA?

46:53.896 --> 46:56.732
Shower sex? Come on!
Friends, my balls!

47:03.197 --> 47:05.657
I like you, Tom.
I just don't want a relationship—

47:05.741 --> 47:08.243
<i>Well, you're not the only one
that gets a say in this!</i>

47:08.327 --> 47:11.371
I do too! And I say we're
a couple, goddamn it!

47:17.794 --> 47:19.838
After you, please.

48:34.329 --> 48:36.331
I shouldn't have done that.

48:38.041 --> 48:40.877
Done what?
Gotten mad at you.

48:40.961 --> 48:42.879
I'm sorry.

48:46.925 --> 48:50.971
Look, we don't have to
put a label on it.

48:51.054 --> 48:53.056
That's fine. I get it.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.226
But, you know, I just—
I need some consistency.

48:56.310 --> 48:58.687
I know.

48:58.770 --> 49:01.773
I need to know that
you're not gonna wake up
in the morning...

49:01.857 --> 49:04.484
and... feel differently.

49:11.408 --> 49:14.244
And I can't give you that.

49:14.328 --> 49:16.246
Nobody can.

49:25.339 --> 49:27.799
That hurt? I'm sorry.

49:27.883 --> 49:30.385
No, it doesn't hurt.

49:30.469 --> 49:32.804
I like you.

49:34.890 --> 49:36.892
All right.

49:46.568 --> 49:49.029
♪ You loved her
You were kissing ♪

49:49.112 --> 49:53.617
Shh. Well, what about you?
Did you ever even
have a boyfriend?

49:53.700 --> 49:55.619
Well, of course.
Yeah?

49:55.702 --> 49:57.663
Yeah.
Well, tell me about them.

49:57.746 --> 49:59.665
No.
Oh? Why not?

49:59.748 --> 50:02.042
Because it's not important.

50:02.125 --> 50:04.628
I'm interested.

50:07.756 --> 50:09.841
All right. Fine.
You want to go there?

50:09.966 --> 50:12.135
Yeah. I can take it.
Fine.

50:15.430 --> 50:17.766
So—

50:17.849 --> 50:20.936
Well, in high school
there was Markus.

50:21.019 --> 50:23.313
Quarterback-slash-homecoming king?

50:23.397 --> 50:25.899
No. He was a rower.

50:27.109 --> 50:29.027
He was very hot.

50:30.946 --> 50:34.658
For a brief time in college
there was, um— there was Charlie.

50:37.202 --> 50:39.121
She was nice, but—

50:40.205 --> 50:42.958
<i>And then there was
my semester in Sienna.</i>

50:43.041 --> 50:45.043
Fernando Belardelli.

50:47.754 --> 50:49.631
Also known as "The Puma."

50:49.715 --> 50:53.176
- The Puma?
<i>- Yeah, The Puma, 'cause, you know.</i>

50:56.805 --> 50:58.974
So—

50:59.099 --> 51:02.310
Oh, that's it?
The ones that lasted, yeah.

51:02.394 --> 51:04.855
What happened? Why—
Why didn't they work out?

51:04.938 --> 51:07.733
What always happens. Life.

51:13.488 --> 51:15.532
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

51:15.615 --> 51:18.577
No, it's not.
It's awesome. Trust me.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.579
I'm serious.

51:21.830 --> 51:23.790
I'll go first.

51:25.459 --> 51:28.211
Penis.

51:36.803 --> 51:38.722
Penis.

51:38.805 --> 51:40.974
Penis!
Penis!

51:41.099 --> 51:43.018
Penis!
There's kids around.

51:43.101 --> 51:45.479
There are no kids around.

51:45.604 --> 51:47.773
Penis!
Penis!

51:47.898 --> 51:50.025
You having fun?
Yeah.

51:50.108 --> 51:52.444
This is the kind of thing
you did with The Puma, isn't it?

51:52.527 --> 51:55.781
Oh, we rarely left the room.

51:55.864 --> 51:58.450
Penis!

51:58.575 --> 52:00.744
Sorry. Tourette's.
You know how it is.
Penis!

52:00.869 --> 52:02.871
She has it too. Penis!
Penis!

52:02.996 --> 52:06.458
Shh. Everyone's
looking over here.
I'm done. I'm done.

52:06.541 --> 52:08.168
Are you done?
I'm done.

52:08.251 --> 52:09.795
You're done?
Yeah.

52:09.920 --> 52:12.088
This is too much.
Unleash me. I'm done.

52:12.172 --> 52:14.174
Promise?
I promise.

52:15.634 --> 52:17.552
I promise.

52:17.636 --> 52:19.930
Penis!

52:33.985 --> 52:37.113
It's very complex.
Mmm.

52:37.197 --> 52:40.242
In a way, it sort of, like,

52:40.325 --> 52:43.119
says... so much...

52:43.203 --> 52:45.997
by...

52:46.081 --> 52:48.375
saying so little.

52:54.339 --> 52:57.717
Do you want to go
to the movies?
Yep.

53:57.569 --> 53:59.487
Suffering.

53:59.571 --> 54:02.157
So much suffering.

54:04.159 --> 54:06.077
Suffering.
Suffering.

54:45.533 --> 54:47.452
T-Tom?

54:47.535 --> 54:50.038
Mr. Vance would like to
see you in his office.

54:51.706 --> 54:53.875
Tom.

54:53.959 --> 54:56.127
Have a seat.

54:59.381 --> 55:02.634
Has something happened
to you recently?

55:02.717 --> 55:04.719
What do you mean?

55:04.803 --> 55:08.264
A death in the family,
someone taken ill—
Anything like that.

55:08.348 --> 55:10.266
No.

55:11.768 --> 55:14.020
Look, I don't mean to pry, but...

55:14.104 --> 55:16.189
does this have something to do
with Summer leaving?

55:16.314 --> 55:19.442
Who?
My assistant.

55:19.567 --> 55:23.697
Your, um—
Tom, everyone knows.

55:25.991 --> 55:27.993
Never mind.

55:28.076 --> 55:31.955
The reason I'm asking is,
lately your work performance...

55:32.038 --> 55:34.708
has been... a little off.

55:34.833 --> 55:37.752
I'm not following.
Okay.

55:37.836 --> 55:40.338
Um, here's something
that you wrote last week.

55:40.422 --> 55:43.508
Uh, "Roses are red,
violets are blue.

55:43.591 --> 55:45.844
Fuck you, whore."

55:45.927 --> 55:48.680
Now, most shoppers
at Valentine's Day—

55:48.805 --> 55:51.683
Mr. Vance, are you firing me?
No. No.

55:51.766 --> 55:54.811
Relax, Hansen.
You're one of the good ones.

55:54.894 --> 55:57.522
Okay. Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

55:57.605 --> 55:59.607
Things have been a little difficult.

55:59.691 --> 56:03.028
<i>That's okay. I completely
understand that.</i>

56:03.111 --> 56:07.532
I'm just saying
that perhaps you could
channel those energies,

56:07.615 --> 56:10.952
um, into something like this.

56:14.622 --> 56:16.583
Funerals and sympathy.

56:16.666 --> 56:20.045
Misery, sadness, loss of faith,

56:20.128 --> 56:22.255
no reason to live.

56:22.338 --> 56:24.841
This is perfect for you.

56:24.966 --> 56:27.427
Uh—
Good. Okay.

56:27.510 --> 56:29.929
Now back to work you go.

56:31.556 --> 56:34.684
Thank you.

56:34.768 --> 56:36.686
Thank you.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.037
Hey.
Hey.

56:54.162 --> 56:56.790
Don't you have, like,
20 cards to write by Friday?
Nope. All done.

56:56.873 --> 56:59.918
Really? Can you help me?
'Cause I've run out of ways
to say "congrats."

57:00.001 --> 57:03.713
Okay. I got "Good job,"
"Well done" and "Way to go."

57:03.797 --> 57:05.423
That's it.

57:05.507 --> 57:09.594
How 'bout, "Every day
you make me proud,

57:10.595 --> 57:12.680
but today you get a card."

57:12.806 --> 57:15.308
Shit, that's good!
I know.

57:16.351 --> 57:19.771
<i>Have you tried "Merry"?</i>

57:19.854 --> 57:23.149
Wow! That's perfect! Merry!
Wow!

57:23.233 --> 57:26.277
We've been stuck on this
for an hour.

57:26.361 --> 57:29.656
Hmm. How about...

57:35.036 --> 57:37.038
"I love us"?

57:37.122 --> 57:38.581
Aw.

57:40.750 --> 57:42.252
I hate Summer.

57:42.335 --> 57:44.379
<i>I hate her crooked teeth.</i>

57:44.462 --> 57:46.172
<i>I hate her 1960s haircut.</i>

57:46.256 --> 57:47.966
<i>I hate her knobby knees.</i>

57:48.049 --> 57:50.927
<i>And I hate her cockroach-shaped
splotch on her neck.</i>

57:51.010 --> 57:53.930
<i>I hate the way she smacks her lips
before she talks.</i>

57:54.013 --> 57:56.516
<i>And I hate the way she sounds
when she laughs.</i>

57:58.309 --> 58:00.979
<i>♪ She's like the wind ♪</i>

58:01.062 --> 58:03.064
I hate this song!

58:04.232 --> 58:07.902
Son, you're gonna
have to exit the vehicle.

58:07.986 --> 58:10.155
<i>I normally don't do blind dates,</i>

58:10.238 --> 58:13.241
but Paul and Robyn spoke
very highly of you.

58:13.366 --> 58:15.785
Ah.
They said you write
greeting cards.

58:15.869 --> 58:17.871
That's so interesting.
I wanted to write.

58:17.954 --> 58:20.248
I actually majored
in English in college,

58:20.331 --> 58:22.292
but what are you gonna do
with that degree?

58:22.417 --> 58:24.544
I went to Brown.
Where did you go?
Alison.

58:24.627 --> 58:26.546
Hmm?

58:26.629 --> 58:28.923
Listen, it's great to meet you,

58:29.007 --> 58:31.384
and... you're a very attractive girl.

58:31.467 --> 58:34.429
I just wanted to say up front
that this isn't—

58:34.554 --> 58:38.016
It's not gonna go anywhere.
Oh.

58:38.099 --> 58:41.769
I liked this girl.
I mean, I loved her.

58:41.853 --> 58:43.771
What does she do?

58:43.855 --> 58:47.483
She took a giant shit
on my face.

58:47.609 --> 58:50.069
Literally.
Literally?

58:51.154 --> 58:54.324
Not literally.
That's disgusting. Jesus.

58:54.407 --> 58:56.618
What's the matter with you?

58:56.701 --> 58:58.620
The point is,

58:59.996 --> 59:02.081
I'm messed up. I am.

59:02.165 --> 59:04.417
You know, on the one hand,
I want to forget her.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.419
On the other hand,

59:06.502 --> 59:10.798
I know that she's the only person
in the entire universe
that will make me happy.

59:10.924 --> 59:12.884
Mm-hmm.
You ever do this?

59:12.967 --> 59:17.597
You think back on the times
you had with someone, replay it
in your head over and over again,

59:17.680 --> 59:20.975
<i>and you look for those
first signs of trouble.</i>

59:23.603 --> 59:25.563
<i>There's two options really.</i>

59:25.647 --> 59:28.733
Either... she's an evil,

59:28.816 --> 59:32.070
emotionless,
miserable human being,

59:32.153 --> 59:36.241
or... she's a robot.

59:36.324 --> 59:38.284
<i>Small Wonder.</i>
You know, Vicki.

59:38.409 --> 59:41.412
That would explain
a lot actually.
Can I ask you a question?

59:42.830 --> 59:44.999
Yeah.
She never cheated on you?

59:45.124 --> 59:49.420
No. Never.
She ever take advantage
of you in any way?

59:49.504 --> 59:51.422
No.

59:51.506 --> 59:55.635
And she told you up front
that she didn't want a boyfriend.

59:57.053 --> 59:59.222
Yeah.

1:00:03.518 --> 1:00:06.187
I got a great idea.

1:00:06.271 --> 1:00:10.233

Oh, fine! Go!
That's fine. See ya.

1:00:22.870 --> 1:00:25.957
Waste of time.
You don't look anything
like Summer.

1:00:27.542 --> 1:00:31.546
<i>Now departing on Track 2,
Pacific Surfliner.</i>

1:00:31.629 --> 1:00:33.840
<i>Full service to Santa Barbara.</i>

1:00:33.923 --> 1:00:35.883
<i>All aboard, please.</i>

1:00:43.308 --> 1:00:45.184
Hey, baby.
Hey, you here?

1:00:45.310 --> 1:00:47.270
Hell no.
What do you mean,
"Hell no"?

1:00:47.395 --> 1:00:49.981
I'm not going to that.
Yes, you are.

1:00:50.064 --> 1:00:52.025
No, man. It's gonna be
all old people.

1:00:52.108 --> 1:00:54.485
Yeah, but you said you were going.
That's why I'm going.

1:00:54.569 --> 1:00:57.363
And that's why
I called her last night,
told her I was sick.

1:00:57.488 --> 1:01:00.908
Like a ninja.
Dude! I'm gonna— I'm not gonna
know anybody at this thing.

1:01:00.992 --> 1:01:03.453
Maybe you'll meet
some hot granddaughters
or something.

1:01:03.578 --> 1:01:05.580
I'm hanging up now.
Bye, baby.

1:01:06.831 --> 1:01:09.042

1:01:09.125 --> 1:01:11.419

1:01:47.413 --> 1:01:49.791
Hey. Summer.

1:01:49.916 --> 1:01:53.669
I must have walked right by you.
Yeah.

1:01:53.753 --> 1:01:56.798
Well, um, what are you doing?
Are you going to Millie's?

1:01:59.175 --> 1:02:01.177
Me too.
Cool.

1:02:01.260 --> 1:02:05.848
- I forgot you knew her.
- Yeah, we worked together
all that time, so—

1:02:05.973 --> 1:02:08.393
<i>Of course.</i>
I love Millie.
She's the sweetest.

1:02:08.476 --> 1:02:10.520
She is.

1:02:10.603 --> 1:02:12.897
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:15.233
Good. I-I wrote to you.
I never heard back, but—

1:02:15.316 --> 1:02:17.777
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that.
I— I just, you know—

1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:21.197
It got kind of crazy,
and the holidays came up,
so work was—

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:23.699
You still working for Vance?

1:02:23.783 --> 1:02:25.576
Yeah.

1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:29.831
Well, I was gonna go get a coffee

If Pickles goes for it right there,
that's a dead cat.

1:13:10.929 --> 1:13:13.932
These are lies. We're liars.

1:13:14.016 --> 1:13:16.351
Think about it.
Why do people buy these things?

1:13:16.435 --> 1:13:18.771
It's not 'cause they want
to say how they feel.

1:13:18.854 --> 1:13:22.816
People buy cards 'cause
they can't say how they feel,
or they're afraid to.

1:13:22.900 --> 1:13:25.319
We provide the service
that lets them off the hook.

1:13:25.402 --> 1:13:28.947
You know what?
I say, to hell with it!
Let's level with America.

1:13:29.031 --> 1:13:31.617
At least let them speak
for themselves! Right?

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:34.912
I mean, look! What— What is this?
What does it say?

1:13:34.995 --> 1:13:36.914
"Congratulations
on your new baby." Right?

1:13:36.997 --> 1:13:39.208
How 'bout, "Congratulations
on your new baby.

1:13:39.291 --> 1:13:42.544
- That's it for hanging out.
Nice knowing you."
- Sit down, Hansen.

1:13:42.628 --> 1:13:46.590
How 'bout this one, with all
the pretty hearts on the front?
I know where this is going. Yep!

1:13:46.673 --> 1:13:50.260
"Happy Valentine's Day,
sweetheart. I love you."

1:13:50.344 --> 1:13:53.847
That sweet? Ain't love grand?

1:13:53.931 --> 1:13:56.100
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1:13:56.183 --> 1:13:58.268
What does that even mean, "love"?

1:13:58.352 --> 1:14:01.146
Do you know? Do you? Anybody?

1:14:01.230 --> 1:14:02.648
Tom.

1:14:02.731 --> 1:14:05.734
If somebody gave me this card,
Mr. Vance, I would eat it.

1:14:07.611 --> 1:14:11.949
It's— It's these cards,
and the movies, and the pop songs—

1:14:12.032 --> 1:14:14.618
They're to blame for all the lies...

1:14:14.701 --> 1:14:18.080
and the heartache, everything.

1:14:18.163 --> 1:14:20.916
And we're responsible.
I'm responsible.

1:14:23.794 --> 1:14:26.797
I think we do a bad thing here.

1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:30.425
People should be able
to say how they feel—
how they really feel—

1:14:30.509 --> 1:14:34.638
not, you know, some words
that some strangers
put in their mouths.

1:14:34.721 --> 1:14:37.224
Words like "love"...

1:14:40.185 --> 1:14:42.521
that don't mean anything.

1:14:43.605 --> 1:14:45.899
Sorry. I'm sorry. I, uh—

1:14:48.318 --> 1:14:50.445
I quit. I'm—

1:14:50.529 --> 1:14:53.115
There's enough bullshit
in the world without my help.

1:15:18.765 --> 1:15:21.393
<i>All right. Next we do running drills.</i>

1:15:21.476 --> 1:15:23.645
Hey, you're sketching again.

1:15:23.729 --> 1:15:25.939
Yeah, well, just doodling.

1:15:26.023 --> 1:15:29.735
Okay, Tom. We got 20 seconds.
Talk to me. You okay?

1:15:29.818 --> 1:15:32.070
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great.

1:15:38.827 --> 1:15:41.371
You know, my friends
are all in love with you.

1:15:41.455 --> 1:15:43.373
<i>You know, it's like we said.</i>

1:15:43.498 --> 1:15:46.668
Plenty of other fish
in the sea.
Thanks.

1:15:46.752 --> 1:15:49.004
But, uh, those are guppies.

1:15:49.087 --> 1:15:51.006
Yeah.

1:15:51.089 --> 1:15:54.384
Hey, Tom?
Mmm.

1:15:54.468 --> 1:15:58.222
Look, I know you think
that she was the one,

1:15:59.473 --> 1:16:01.808
but I don't.

1:16:01.892 --> 1:16:05.145
Now, I think you're just
remembering the good stuff.

1:16:05.229 --> 1:16:08.232
Next time you look back, I, uh—

1:16:08.315 --> 1:16:10.817
I really think
you should look again.

1:16:48.063 --> 1:16:51.692
It's playing at 5:00.
Do you wanna see it?

1:16:51.775 --> 1:16:55.737
Um, I don't know.
We could just go back
to your place or—

1:16:55.821 --> 1:16:58.657
No, I really want to see it.
Let's go.

I always loved this place,
ever since you brought me.

1:22:16.808 --> 1:22:19.477
So I, uh—

1:22:19.561 --> 1:22:21.896
I guess I should say
congratulations.

1:22:23.523 --> 1:22:25.483
Only if you mean it.

1:22:25.567 --> 1:22:28.361
Ah. Well, in that case—

1:22:35.201 --> 1:22:37.996
So, are you okay?

1:22:38.079 --> 1:22:41.124
I will be, eventually.

1:22:41.207 --> 1:22:43.585
You wanna—
<i>Hmm.</i>

1:22:46.880 --> 1:22:49.007
I like your suit.
Ah, thanks.

1:22:49.132 --> 1:22:51.384
You look sharp.

1:22:51.509 --> 1:22:54.554
So do you.
Thanks.

1:22:54.638 --> 1:22:57.140
I quit the office.
You did?

1:22:57.223 --> 1:22:59.559
I didn't know. That's great!

1:23:01.311 --> 1:23:03.229
And you, um—

1:23:04.272 --> 1:23:06.191
you're married.

1:23:06.274 --> 1:23:08.943
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

1:23:17.369 --> 1:23:21.331
You should have told me
when we were at the—
I know.

1:23:21.414 --> 1:23:23.750
You know, at the wedding
when we were dancing.

1:23:23.875 --> 1:23:26.294
Well, he hadn't asked me yet.
But he was in your life.

1:23:26.419 --> 1:23:29.130
Yeah.
So why'd you dance with me?

1:23:31.841 --> 1:23:34.177
'Cause I wanted to.

1:23:36.096 --> 1:23:39.099
You just do what you want,
don't you?

1:23:46.314 --> 1:23:48.650
You never wanted to be
anybody's girlfriend,

1:23:48.733 --> 1:23:50.985
and now you're somebody's wife.

1:23:51.069 --> 1:23:53.154
Surprised me too.

1:23:53.238 --> 1:23:56.032
I don't think I'll ever
understand that.

1:23:57.450 --> 1:24:00.120
I mean,
it doesn't make sense.

1:24:01.621 --> 1:24:03.581
It just happened.

1:24:03.665 --> 1:24:07.544
Right, but that's what
I don't understand.
What just happened?

1:24:07.627 --> 1:24:11.965
I just— I just woke up one day,
and I knew.

1:24:12.048 --> 1:24:13.967
Knew what?

1:24:16.302 --> 1:24:18.805
What I was never sure of with you.

1:24:32.986 --> 1:24:34.988
You know what sucks?

1:24:35.071 --> 1:24:38.450
Realizing that everything
you believe in is complete
and utter bullshit.

1:24:38.533 --> 1:24:40.535
It sucks.
What do you mean?

1:24:40.618 --> 1:24:44.581
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love,

1:24:44.664 --> 1:24:49.335
and all that childhood
fairy tale nonsense.

1:24:49.419 --> 1:24:51.713
You were right.
I-I should have listened to you.

1:24:51.838 --> 1:24:55.300
No.
Yeah. What?
What are you smiling at?

1:24:56.509 --> 1:24:58.970
Tom.
What?

1:25:00.638 --> 1:25:03.391
What are you looking at me
like that for?

1:25:03.475 --> 1:25:06.102
Well, you know,

1:25:06.186 --> 1:25:08.396
I guess it's 'cause...

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:11.024
I was sitting in a deli
and reading <i>Dorian Gray,</i>

1:25:11.107 --> 1:25:13.610
and... a guy comes up to me...

1:25:13.693 --> 1:25:16.279
and asked me about it,

1:25:16.362 --> 1:25:19.365
and... now he's my husband.

1:25:22.202 --> 1:25:24.662
Yeah. And... so?

1:25:24.746 --> 1:25:28.625
So, what if I'd gone to the movies?

1:25:28.708 --> 1:25:33.630
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

1:25:33.713 --> 1:25:37.050
What if I'd gotten there
10 minutes later?

1:25:38.551 --> 1:25:40.637
It was—

1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:43.056
It was meant to be.

1:25:43.139 --> 1:25:45.809
And I just kept thinking,

1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:49.562
Tom was right.
No.

1:25:49.646 --> 1:25:51.731
Yeah, I did.

1:25:51.815 --> 1:25:54.317
I did.

1:26:00.949 --> 1:26:03.535
It just wasn't me
that you were right about.

1:26:30.103 --> 1:26:32.021
I should go.

1:26:32.105 --> 1:26:35.108
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.

1:26:42.574 --> 1:26:44.576
Summer!

1:26:46.578 --> 1:26:48.788
I really do hope
that you're happy.

Are you interviewing
for the position?

1:28:06.032 --> 1:28:08.534
Oh, yeah. Why? Are you?
Yeah.

1:28:08.618 --> 1:28:10.536
Mm-hmm.

1:28:10.620 --> 1:28:12.747
My competition.

1:28:12.830 --> 1:28:15.500
It would appear.

1:28:15.583 --> 1:28:19.754
Yeah. So, a little awkward.

1:28:19.837 --> 1:28:21.756
Yeah.

1:28:22.799 --> 1:28:27.720

don't get the job.

1:28:33.434 --> 1:28:36.270

1:28:36.354 --> 1:28:38.356
Me? I don't think so.

1:28:39.732 --> 1:28:42.151
Do you ever go
to Angelus Plaza?

1:28:42.235 --> 1:28:45.154
Yes. That's, like,
my favorite spot in the city.

1:28:45.238 --> 1:28:47.198
Yeah. Okay. Except for
the parking lots, but—

1:28:47.323 --> 1:28:49.200
Yeah. I— I agree.
Yeah, yeah.

1:28:49.325 --> 1:28:51.327

Really?

1:28:51.452 --> 1:28:54.288
Yeah.
I haven't seen you.

1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:58.668

have been looking.

<i>to a simple earthly event.</i>

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:11.723

1:29:35.204 --> 1:29:37.415
I just left, uh—
Can I— One second.

1:29:37.498 --> 1:29:40.251
<i>He was pretty sure.</i>

1:29:40.334 --> 1:29:43.421
- Hey.
- You again.

1:29:43.504 --> 1:29:45.840
Yeah. I, uh, was just wondering...

1:29:45.923 --> 1:29:49.177
if maybe after this, if, um, you—

1:29:51.095 --> 1:29:53.723
you want to get some coffee
or something.

1:29:53.806 --> 1:29:55.808
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:29:55.892 --> 1:29:59.937
I'm sort of supposed to
meet someone after this.

1:30:00.021 --> 1:30:01.981
Okay.

1:30:09.322 --> 1:30:11.199
Sure.

1:30:11.324 --> 1:30:13.910
What's that?
Why not?

1:30:13.993 --> 1:30:17.246
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh—
I'll wait for you—

1:30:17.371 --> 1:30:19.540
We— We'll figure it out.
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>
