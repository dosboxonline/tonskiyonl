02:33.080 --> 02:34.991
This film is dedicated...

02:35.320 --> 02:37.231
to the memory of Andre Bazin

03:09.600 --> 03:11.636
Doinel! Bring me that!

03:18.440 --> 03:20.590
Indeed! Go to the corner!

03:27.560 --> 03:28.754
1 minute left!

03:29.640 --> 03:30.789
Quiet!

03:32.600 --> 03:35.160
We'll collect them in 30 seconds!

03:35.360 --> 03:36.588
Quiet!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.560
Line heads, get ready!

03:50.080 --> 03:51.832
I'll count to 3

03:53.440 --> 03:54.429
1...

03:55.560 --> 03:56.595
2...

03:58.160 --> 03:59.639
3! Collect!

04:07.520 --> 04:08.953
Collect in back!

04:11.040 --> 04:12.712
- Gimme!
- Wait a sec!

04:12.880 --> 04:14.711
- What is it?
- He won't give it!

04:14.880 --> 04:16.313
No favoritism!

04:18.279 --> 04:19.110
Brown-noser!

04:20.800 --> 04:22.711
Is everyone's paper in?

04:22.880 --> 04:24.154
You may go!

04:26.080 --> 04:28.150
Sorry! Not you!

04:29.440 --> 04:32.113
Recess is a reward,
not an obligation!

05:07.520 --> 05:10.592
Here
suffered Antoine Doinel unfairly...

05:10.800 --> 05:13.553
punished by a prof
for a pin-up clad barely

05:13.720 --> 05:16.553
So it's now forsooth,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth!

05:16.720 --> 05:19.518
Alright, champs,
maybe you need a ref!

05:19.680 --> 05:22.114
You can train for 3 days!
No recess!

05:22.280 --> 05:24.430
3 days of rest will do you good!

05:34.960 --> 05:36.996
Come look! This is funny!

05:38.080 --> 05:40.150
What's so interesting there?

05:40.720 --> 05:41.994
Take your seats!

05:49.280 --> 05:50.395
Bravo!

05:53.800 --> 05:55.836
We have a new Juvenal in our class!

05:56.000 --> 05:59.072
But he can't tell
an Alexandrine from a decasyllable!

05:59.640 --> 06:02.154
For tomorrow you'll conjugate...

06:02.320 --> 06:04.311
Doinel, sit down!

06:06.240 --> 06:08.231
in all tenses of the indicative...

06:08.440 --> 06:11.830
conditional and subjunctive moods...
Your notebooks!

06:13.840 --> 06:16.308
I dirty the classroom walls...

06:20.480 --> 06:23.119
and misuse French versification

06:25.440 --> 06:26.759
The Hare...

06:35.200 --> 06:37.156
Doinel, go to the janitor and...

06:37.360 --> 06:39.749
get something
to remove that nonsense...

06:40.160 --> 06:42.230
or else you'll lick it off!

06:45.440 --> 06:49.592
Richer, who said
you could change seats?

06:59.040 --> 07:02.077
In the days when the bushes...

07:03.280 --> 07:05.032
the bushes...

07:06.080 --> 07:08.435
were aflame with flowers...

07:09.400 --> 07:10.879
bright red...

07:14.600 --> 07:17.433
When already the dark tips...

07:20.000 --> 07:21.479
When already...

07:23.040 --> 07:24.758
the dark tips...

07:27.280 --> 07:29.350
of my long ears...

07:31.040 --> 07:32.678
were seen...

07:35.840 --> 07:37.671
above my head...

07:40.960 --> 07:44.077
In the still unripe rye...

07:51.720 --> 07:53.392
I munched on...

07:55.840 --> 07:57.273
the leaves...

08:01.440 --> 08:04.637
Pointing to the sky

08:12.320 --> 08:13.639
One day...

08:17.280 --> 08:19.919
comma... weary I lay...

08:24.640 --> 08:26.232
in my den...

08:29.080 --> 08:30.752
with sleep-filled eyes...

08:31.520 --> 08:34.557
When little Margot
found me by surprise!

08:38.880 --> 08:41.155
- Right, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir!

08:41.320 --> 08:42.514
Sure! The other guy!

08:42.880 --> 08:45.110
True, she liked me...

08:45.920 --> 08:47.035
very much...

08:47.520 --> 08:50.114
my gentle mistress!

09:00.320 --> 09:02.197
How good to me...

09:03.200 --> 09:05.760
so caring... such tenderness!

09:06.720 --> 09:09.757
How she held me on her lap...

09:10.240 --> 09:11.878
and kissed me!

09:13.280 --> 09:14.872
What fool whistled?

09:15.040 --> 09:17.759
Confess or I'll punish anybody!

09:18.080 --> 09:19.354
Right, Simonot?

09:19.520 --> 09:20.953
I swear, sir!

09:21.280 --> 09:22.429
It wasn't me!

09:22.720 --> 09:24.631
And you're cowards!

09:24.960 --> 09:26.359
What a class!

09:26.560 --> 09:30.109
I've known morons
but at least they didn't let it show

09:30.600 --> 09:32.477
They hid in their corner

09:32.800 --> 09:34.358
And you?

09:34.560 --> 09:38.189
Call that clean! You've made
it dirtier! Copy the poem!

09:38.400 --> 09:39.628
Your parents'll pay

09:39.920 --> 09:42.559
What'll France be like in 10 years?

09:50.400 --> 09:53.676
- All guys rob their parents.
- Yeah but it's hard

09:53.840 --> 09:55.512
Even Mauricet!

09:55.680 --> 09:59.355
Mauricet!
Where'd you buy those goggles?

09:59.520 --> 10:01.078
A department store

10:01.240 --> 10:04.471
Did ya swipe the money
from your dad or your ma?

10:04.760 --> 10:07.911
Don't tell me
ya don't go through their pockets!

10:08.080 --> 10:11.152
And ya got me caught earlier!

10:11.720 --> 10:13.517
Ya bastard!

10:13.680 --> 10:16.911
- Your days're numbered!
- You'll get yours!

10:19.440 --> 10:21.670
I'll never do it all tonight

10:31.200 --> 10:32.713
That prof's a bastard

10:33.040 --> 10:34.155
It's his job!

10:34.320 --> 10:36.390
But before I'm drafted...

10:36.560 --> 10:38.949
I'll bash his head in!

12:40.400 --> 12:43.631
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls

12:56.880 --> 12:59.474
- Evening, Mama!
- Good evening...

13:06.800 --> 13:08.199
Where's the flour?

13:08.720 --> 13:12.395
- What flour?
- You didn't buy what I wrote down!

13:13.360 --> 13:16.272
- Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it

13:16.440 --> 13:18.795
No wonder
you get such bad grades!

13:18.960 --> 13:20.552
Get my slippers!

13:22.960 --> 13:24.552
In the bedroom!

13:24.880 --> 13:25.995
Under the bed!

13:31.760 --> 13:33.318
I need some flour

13:33.560 --> 13:35.118
Go get it at once!

13:37.680 --> 13:38.874
Yes, Mama

13:53.680 --> 13:56.274
They used forceps.
He came out ass first!

13:56.440 --> 13:59.034
It's hereditary!
His mother was the same way

13:59.200 --> 14:03.239
It means nothing! Look at my Fanny!
It was over in 10 minutes

14:03.400 --> 14:06.949
But for the little one,
if I hadn't had a Caesarean...

14:07.120 --> 14:08.872
we wouldn't be talkin' now!

14:09.040 --> 14:11.998
And my sister... One a year!
Can you imagine?

14:15.440 --> 14:19.353
They finally took out everything.
Blood all over the place!

14:22.480 --> 14:23.674
In a rush, son?

14:23.840 --> 14:25.876
I just got hell for some flour

14:26.040 --> 14:30.272
Don't upset your mother!
She has to be handled with care

14:31.240 --> 14:34.038
- What's that?
- An anti-fog spotlight

14:34.200 --> 14:36.156
I'm gonna try it out Sunday

14:46.320 --> 14:48.754
Look at your son!
All flour-faced!

14:48.920 --> 14:50.478
I'm not in the mood!

14:50.720 --> 14:53.029
I was hoping you were!

14:54.520 --> 14:55.669
And my change?

14:55.840 --> 14:59.515
- I need money for the cafeteria.
- Ask your dad

15:04.280 --> 15:05.952
A storm's brewing!

15:06.120 --> 15:08.714
- Papa, for the cafeteria...
- What?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.473
I need 1,000 francs

15:10.640 --> 15:14.110
Ya ask for 1,000 and hope for 500.
So ya only need 300

15:14.320 --> 15:16.038
Here's 100

15:16.560 --> 15:20.235
Take 500.
But your mom's supposed to pay that

15:20.400 --> 15:21.719
The scissors!

15:21.880 --> 15:23.916
Where are the scissors?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.997
It's not funny!

15:26.400 --> 15:29.517
No homework now! It's time to eat

15:29.960 --> 15:34.431
Right! Each thing has its time and
place. That way, the cows're safe!

15:36.080 --> 15:37.672
Is that a new pen?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.198
I made a swap for it

15:40.400 --> 15:42.470
You swap a lot lately!

15:47.960 --> 15:50.599
What's that smell?

15:51.680 --> 15:52.715
It's the fish

15:52.880 --> 15:54.074
And how!

15:56.840 --> 15:59.115
Ask your mom if her hot-pad is hot

15:59.400 --> 16:00.515
Why?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.553
For laughs!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.514
You can clear the table now

16:21.840 --> 16:25.435
Your cousin phoned.
His wife is expecting again

16:25.600 --> 16:26.715
Her 4th in 3 years?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.837
They're like rabbits. Disgusting!

16:29.760 --> 16:32.399
And what about our kid
during vacation?

16:32.560 --> 16:35.757
- Who're summer camps for?
- He'd have fun there

16:35.920 --> 16:37.273
It's 8 months off!

16:37.600 --> 16:39.909
Never too early to plan a vacation!

16:41.920 --> 16:44.309
Don't pull so hard!

16:45.760 --> 16:46.875
Great, huh?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.314
Lions' Club...

16:48.480 --> 16:49.754
What's all this?

16:49.920 --> 16:51.558
Take it easy!

16:52.160 --> 16:53.752
For Sunday's race...

16:53.920 --> 16:57.435
shall I pick the Chevreuse Valley
or along the Oise?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.158
On Sunday I rest

17:00.160 --> 17:01.957
I'm going to see Huguette

17:02.160 --> 17:03.957
But I'm the race organiser!

17:04.119 --> 17:06.792
I'm sick of housework...

17:06.960 --> 17:08.951
And dates in the afternoon!

17:09.200 --> 17:11.474
I mean the edible kind!

17:11.640 --> 17:13.915
What're you waiting for?
Go to bed!

17:16.160 --> 17:17.752
G'night!

17:18.560 --> 17:19.992
You can be so stupid!

17:20.960 --> 17:23.190
If you could only take a joke...

17:23.520 --> 17:25.909
Your auto races are a waste of time!

17:26.119 --> 17:29.112
The garbage!
Lights out as soon as you're in bed!

17:29.320 --> 17:33.279
I make contacts!
One day I'll be vice-president!

18:20.120 --> 18:22.998
Hurry up! It's late!
I didn't hear the alarm

18:39.520 --> 18:43.195
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls!

18:46.400 --> 18:48.630
There's no socks around these holes!

18:48.840 --> 18:52.355
Buy a new pair!
The others are in the laundry

18:53.920 --> 18:57.196
I gave you money for sheets
for the kid's bed

18:57.440 --> 19:00.318
He prefers his sleeping bag

19:00.640 --> 19:02.073
Right, honey?

19:02.440 --> 19:04.590
At least I'm warm in it

19:04.800 --> 19:06.392
You still here?

19:07.920 --> 19:09.273
Bye, Pa! Mama!

19:13.600 --> 19:15.033
Don't rush so fast!

19:15.200 --> 19:19.352
We'll get locked out
and have to see the director

19:19.680 --> 19:22.069
- No need to hurry!
- Why?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.595
The prof said he won't let ya in

19:25.120 --> 19:27.270
- He means it?
- He can't stand you

19:27.440 --> 19:29.749
- Have you money?
- Yes for the canteen

19:29.920 --> 19:31.831
Trust me... This way!

19:32.160 --> 19:33.752
What'll we do now?

19:54.400 --> 19:55.833
Follow me!

19:56.560 --> 19:58.869
Put your satchel with mine

23:38.440 --> 23:40.032
Antoine! He saw me!

23:40.320 --> 23:42.436
- Which one's he?
- With dark hair

23:42.640 --> 23:44.437
But he should be in school!

23:44.760 --> 23:47.558
- You'll get it!
- She won't dare tell Dad

23:47.720 --> 23:49.915
- And the guy?
- Never saw him before!

23:50.080 --> 23:51.559
So you're safe!

24:18.600 --> 24:20.511
I'm going to school tomorrow...

24:20.680 --> 24:23.877
but I'll need an excuse.
How'll you manage?

24:24.080 --> 24:28.198
I've got an old one.
I'll cut off the date

24:28.520 --> 24:30.590
You can borrow it and copy it

24:30.920 --> 24:32.433
But the handwriting?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.158
Imitate your mother's

24:34.440 --> 24:36.829
That'll be hard. It's angular

24:37.000 --> 24:40.231
- Don't worry, it'll work.
- I hope so!

24:40.400 --> 24:42.277
- Bye!
- Bye!

24:48.440 --> 24:51.113
I ask you to please...

24:52.680 --> 24:54.352
excuse...

24:55.240 --> 24:56.798
my son...

25:01.320 --> 25:04.949
Rene... who was ill...

25:05.800 --> 25:07.074
My son Rene!

25:28.520 --> 25:30.590
It smells like something burnt!

25:30.800 --> 25:32.028
That's downstairs

25:32.200 --> 25:33.792
Set the table just for 2

25:34.040 --> 25:35.473
Why? Is Mom gone?

25:35.640 --> 25:38.598
She phoned me to say
she'll be late tonight

25:38.880 --> 25:41.348
Her boss needs her for the budget

25:43.080 --> 25:46.277
So we'll cook
and have a man-to-man dinner

25:47.040 --> 25:49.190
She mentioned
some eggs someplace

25:49.360 --> 25:50.918
I know where they are

25:56.680 --> 25:58.591
Did you study hard today?

25:59.760 --> 26:01.478
What'd you do?

26:01.680 --> 26:03.079
The hare

26:03.240 --> 26:04.514
And the tortoise?

26:04.840 --> 26:07.559
No, just questions about the hare

26:08.360 --> 26:11.079
- Did you answer right?
- He didn't ask me

26:11.240 --> 26:13.959
You've got to speak up!

26:14.160 --> 26:16.151
If not, you're out of the race

26:16.360 --> 26:19.318
You've got to take
the initiative in life

26:20.040 --> 26:23.032
Have you thought
of your mother's birthday?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.832
It's the 17th

26:25.160 --> 26:27.390
I hope you'll give her something

26:28.840 --> 26:30.273
You hear me?

26:31.920 --> 26:33.478
I know what you think

26:34.400 --> 26:36.834
She's been hard on you lately but...

26:37.160 --> 26:39.720
she's a very nervous woman

26:40.040 --> 26:42.110
Put yourself in her shoes!

26:42.440 --> 26:45.955
She has her housework
plus an afternoon job

26:46.160 --> 26:48.196
And this place is too tiny

26:49.000 --> 26:51.992
But we'll move.
I got a lead on a new place

26:55.840 --> 26:58.274
In an office
it's always the same story

26:58.440 --> 27:01.591
Women are exploited
and can't defend themselves

27:02.600 --> 27:05.353
But she loves you! Oh shit!

27:16.920 --> 27:19.639
- Where'd you put my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it

27:19.800 --> 27:22.439
You know I can't stand lying

27:24.040 --> 27:27.077
I put it in its place yesterday

27:27.400 --> 27:28.594
It's not me!

27:28.760 --> 27:31.718
It's crazy how things disappear!

27:33.080 --> 27:34.274
It's not me

27:38.000 --> 27:39.718
I'll ask your mother

27:44.280 --> 27:45.952
It's time for bed

27:47.200 --> 27:48.997
Don't forget the garbage

28:43.560 --> 28:45.152
My boss drove me home

28:45.800 --> 28:48.951
Exactly! I couldn't say no to that

28:49.120 --> 28:52.351
- Night work pays double.
- Wait'll ya see my pay!

28:52.520 --> 28:54.829
That kind of overtime is paid cash!

28:56.040 --> 28:58.759
No wonder
you need to rest on Sunday!

28:58.920 --> 29:00.273
Where's my Michelin?

29:00.440 --> 29:02.749
No idea! The kid might know

29:02.920 --> 29:05.036
- He doesn't.
- He's a liar!

29:05.200 --> 29:07.395
- Like you!
- If ya raised him right...

29:07.560 --> 29:10.154
Shit! I gave him a name!
I feed him!

29:10.600 --> 29:15.230
I'm sick of your complaints! Fed up!
If ya can't stand him, say so

29:15.400 --> 29:17.470
We'll put him in an orphanage...

29:17.800 --> 29:19.711
so I can have some peace!

29:37.720 --> 29:40.234
We'll eat out
till the end of the month!

29:40.400 --> 29:42.914
How? I don't have a clean shirt!

29:43.080 --> 29:45.514
You could at least do the collars

29:45.680 --> 29:48.399
You and your anti-foglight!
Just to show off!

29:48.600 --> 29:50.192
I bought it second-hand

29:57.480 --> 29:58.754
Go open the door

29:58.920 --> 30:00.592
Maybe it's the gas man

30:00.920 --> 30:02.831
They send a notice first

30:08.320 --> 30:10.914
I'm in Antoine's class.
Is he any better?

30:12.040 --> 30:12.790
Why?

30:13.240 --> 30:15.959
He missed school yesterday

30:16.240 --> 30:17.719
Ya hear that?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.830
You don't seem surprised

30:31.000 --> 30:34.436
Why should I be?
He's capable of anything

30:38.320 --> 30:39.799
What'll my excuse be?

30:39.960 --> 30:42.349
The bigger the lie,
the better it works

30:42.520 --> 30:45.318
When Ma broke her leg,
I went back...

30:45.480 --> 30:47.789
without an excuse

30:48.040 --> 30:50.679
I can't make up a story like that

30:51.000 --> 30:52.797
We mustn't go in together

30:52.960 --> 30:54.439
Right. You go first

31:18.800 --> 31:20.279
So there you are!

31:21.000 --> 31:23.798
Extra homework made you sick, eh?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.672
Your folks fell for it?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.832
I'd like to see
what kind of excuse you have

31:29.040 --> 31:31.315
- Let's have it.
- I don't have one

31:31.480 --> 31:34.119
You expect to get away
with it like that?

31:34.280 --> 31:35.952
It'd be too easy!

31:37.560 --> 31:39.676
Sir, it's my mother

31:39.840 --> 31:41.398
What about her?

31:41.560 --> 31:42.913
She's just died

31:45.880 --> 31:48.440
I'm sorry... I didn't know...

31:48.880 --> 31:50.677
Was she ill?

31:50.880 --> 31:52.074
Yes, sir

31:52.240 --> 31:56.153
You could've told me.
You should confide in your teachers

31:56.960 --> 31:59.155
Go join the others

32:09.720 --> 32:10.869
And your excuse?

32:11.040 --> 32:12.553
Never mind!

32:23.480 --> 32:26.631
- 'Tis best a thorn in the wood...
...than in the ass!

32:27.000 --> 32:30.549
If you'd wash your ears
you'd hear your prompter!

32:30.880 --> 32:32.108
Up your'ear!

32:32.280 --> 32:34.350
He's just trying to confuse me

32:34.520 --> 32:37.796
- Enough! Continue...
- I'm all mixed up

32:40.040 --> 32:41.553
Than in the flowers...

32:41.760 --> 32:44.672
...the flowers.
'Tis best independence...

32:45.640 --> 32:47.551
And incessant peril...

32:47.800 --> 32:49.233
Than slavery...

32:53.000 --> 32:56.515
In eternal April.
You're an eternal loafer! Sit down!

32:56.760 --> 32:58.318
I knew it at home!

32:59.000 --> 33:00.592
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir!

33:00.760 --> 33:01.988
I'm sorry...

33:02.240 --> 33:03.514
Simonot!

33:03.920 --> 33:05.592
The Hare...

33:19.960 --> 33:21.473
Sit down!

33:47.840 --> 33:50.593
He must be punished
within the limits...

33:50.760 --> 33:52.478
He's beyond all limits!

33:52.640 --> 33:55.871
Only his parents
can deal with such a mistake

33:56.040 --> 33:58.429
We'll settle this tonight at home!

34:05.920 --> 34:07.399
What'll you do?

34:07.720 --> 34:11.235
After this I can't live
with my parents any more

34:11.760 --> 34:13.637
I've got to disappear

34:13.880 --> 34:15.598
Mine've been through worse!

34:15.760 --> 34:18.831
Yeah, but I want
to live my own life

34:19.000 --> 34:20.831
I'll write them a letter

34:21.000 --> 34:23.070
- Right now?
- It's best that way

34:23.239 --> 34:24.672
Where'll ya sleep?

34:25.080 --> 34:27.230
I don't know. I don't care

34:27.400 --> 34:29.152
I've got an idea

34:29.400 --> 34:31.708
Be at the Pigalle fountain
in 1 hour

34:31.880 --> 34:32.995
OK

34:54.679 --> 34:56.830
It's my uncle's old print shop

34:57.160 --> 34:59.674
The floor collapsed
under the heavy machines

34:59.840 --> 35:01.353
Will it collapse again?

35:05.720 --> 35:08.996
It can't fall any lower.
You'll be warm here

35:21.400 --> 35:24.597
A mattress...
This'll do for a pillow

35:26.440 --> 35:27.873
It's real heavy!

35:30.360 --> 35:32.510
Go for a walk till midnight

35:35.400 --> 35:38.949
- Keep my satchel until tomorrow.
- OK

35:42.880 --> 35:46.873
Dear Parents... I understand
the seriousness of my lie

35:47.040 --> 35:49.600
Why'd he kill me instead of you?

35:49.760 --> 35:51.637
A matter of preference!

35:51.800 --> 35:53.836
Life between us is impossible

35:54.000 --> 35:57.310
So I'm going to try my luck
in the city or elsewhere

35:57.640 --> 35:59.232
I want to become a man

35:59.400 --> 36:02.437
When I see you again,
we'll have a full explanation

36:02.600 --> 36:04.716
I close with kisses... Antoine

36:04.880 --> 36:08.509
- It's normal that he hates me?
- You're hard on him

36:08.680 --> 36:10.318
He gets on my nerves!

36:32.360 --> 36:35.716
- Can you help me catch him?
- Sure!

36:37.480 --> 36:40.278
- Your sister?
- No, her dog got away

36:40.440 --> 36:43.238
- It's a lost dog or hers?
- I don't know!

36:46.600 --> 36:49.558
- May I help?
- Yes! The more, the better!

36:49.720 --> 36:51.870
- What's his name?
- I've no idea

36:53.800 --> 36:55.028
Forget it, kid

36:55.240 --> 36:57.151
But I saw him first!

36:57.480 --> 36:58.799
Understand me?

39:57.320 --> 39:58.435
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir?

39:58.600 --> 40:02.718
- Did things explode last night?
- No, everything was fine!

40:05.320 --> 40:07.151
Parents spoil 'em rotten!

40:09.040 --> 40:10.951
Chabrol, want some help?

40:15.040 --> 40:18.350
The last question is even easier

40:31.680 --> 40:33.796
as if you're lisping

40:36.160 --> 40:39.630
I can't. Not everyone can use
their tongue like you said

40:39.800 --> 40:44.157
Quiet!
S... Si... Go sit down!

40:46.160 --> 40:47.309
Impudent!

40:49.280 --> 40:51.032
Now you!

40:51.920 --> 40:53.751
Answer me!

41:15.840 --> 41:17.114
Doinel?

41:22.400 --> 41:25.119
Frochot, take over until I return

41:32.040 --> 41:34.554
We don't know how to handle him!

41:34.880 --> 41:37.633
Madam, you don't deserve
such a rascal

41:38.720 --> 41:39.835
My poor baby!

41:40.120 --> 41:42.873
Where'd you spend the night?

41:43.200 --> 41:45.760
- In a print shop.
- At a printer's?

41:46.080 --> 41:48.958
I don't care if he's last
so long as he behaves!

41:49.120 --> 41:50.394
Fine!

41:53.600 --> 41:55.989
Maybe it's... glandular

42:10.400 --> 42:12.356
You mustn't catch cold

42:13.800 --> 42:15.711
And now to bed!

42:17.040 --> 42:18.598
I'm not sleepy

42:20.160 --> 42:22.674
You'll be better off in our bed

42:33.560 --> 42:36.154
You know, I was your age once

42:36.600 --> 42:37.953
Kids forget that!

42:38.120 --> 42:40.793
I was stubborn
and wouldn't confide in my parents

42:41.000 --> 42:43.070
So I wrote everything in a diary

42:43.480 --> 42:47.314
Nobody's ever read it.
One day I'll show it to you

42:48.160 --> 42:52.836
At your age I went on vacation
with a shepherd boy I liked but...

42:53.000 --> 42:57.152
they caught us! Ma made me swear
not to see him again...

42:57.320 --> 43:01.029
and never told Papa.
So I cried a lot but I obeyed her

43:01.400 --> 43:05.518
We should always obey our mothers!
We can have secrets!

43:06.720 --> 43:09.154
What did you mean in your letter...

43:09.480 --> 43:11.596
about having a full explanation?

43:12.240 --> 43:16.313
I meant about my bad behavior
and why I don't study hard

43:16.480 --> 43:18.311
So, tell me...

43:18.520 --> 43:20.317
I don't know how to listen...

43:20.560 --> 43:23.120
so I want to quit
and earn my own living

43:24.200 --> 43:26.236
That's crazy! You've no idea!

43:26.560 --> 43:29.279
I so regret not going
beyond high school!

43:29.440 --> 43:31.954
Your dad has only
an elementary diploma

43:32.200 --> 43:33.679
It hampers him!

43:34.560 --> 43:37.279
I know school
teaches lots of useless stuff

43:37.600 --> 43:39.511
Algebra and science don't...

43:40.320 --> 43:41.753
help many people

43:41.920 --> 43:46.232
But French! You always need it
for writing letters!

43:47.040 --> 43:49.270
Let's share another secret, OK?

43:51.520 --> 43:55.115
On your next French essay...
if you're among...

43:55.560 --> 43:58.677
the top 5,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!

44:00.160 --> 44:02.230
But don't tell your father!

45:34.960 --> 45:37.428
Suddenly the dying man
rose up on his fists...

45:37.600 --> 45:41.115
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

45:41.280 --> 45:44.033
The hair at his nape moved.
His wrinkles quivered

45:44.200 --> 45:45.918
His face brightened

45:46.240 --> 45:50.233
A breath wafted his face, making it
sublime. He lifted his fist...

45:50.880 --> 45:53.633
and shouted
Archimedes' famous word...

45:53.840 --> 45:56.149
Eureka! I have found it!

46:08.960 --> 46:13.556
Describe a major event you witnessed
and which concerned you personally

46:15.360 --> 46:17.271
Eureka! I have found it!

46:20.880 --> 46:22.233
The Death...

46:23.680 --> 46:26.319
of My Grandfather

46:53.120 --> 46:56.078
The monkey's finally laid
the new typist!

46:57.000 --> 46:58.718
She's made the most of it!

46:58.960 --> 47:02.714
She got herself named
executive secretary

47:03.840 --> 47:06.559
She fills all the requirements!

47:06.880 --> 47:10.236
Gotta be careful of her now
because of pillow talk!

47:11.040 --> 47:14.828
When she was on the road, I told her
how to juggle her expense account

47:15.000 --> 47:18.037
Instead of that,
she stayed in 3-star hotels!

47:19.200 --> 47:22.795
Say, I still haven't found
my Michelin hotel guide

47:23.760 --> 47:25.751
One of you has moved it

47:25.920 --> 47:27.831
Oh, you and your Michelin!

47:28.160 --> 47:30.196
I don't like mysteries

47:30.800 --> 47:32.358
What's on the stove?

47:32.520 --> 47:34.238
Nothing! I'm sure!

47:38.560 --> 47:40.152
Put it out! Don't yell!

47:40.800 --> 47:42.392
Get some water!

47:46.080 --> 47:48.150
Ya blockhead!

47:48.480 --> 47:51.836
What made ya
light a candle in there?

47:52.160 --> 47:53.434
It was for Balzac!

47:53.760 --> 47:56.832
Balzac? Ya take me for a fool?

47:57.000 --> 48:00.151
- For my French essay!
- Yes, he promised me something

48:00.320 --> 48:02.959
What? A bonus for fire damage?

48:03.200 --> 48:05.031
Ya need more than a candle!

48:05.200 --> 48:08.158
- Want my lighter?
- Don't be silly!

48:08.320 --> 48:11.835
For as long as you're living here,
you'll do as I say!

48:12.080 --> 48:14.230
If not, it means military academy!

48:14.400 --> 48:17.597
Know what that is?
You'll find out!

48:17.920 --> 48:19.512
And you'll toe the line!

48:20.480 --> 48:22.710
Know what we'll do
for a change of air?

48:23.040 --> 48:24.951
We'll all go to the movies tonight!

48:25.280 --> 48:28.955
Fine! A great method of education!

48:29.280 --> 48:32.477
- How's your French essay?
- Not bad

48:34.480 --> 48:37.278
Listen, Julian... Trust us!

48:38.120 --> 48:39.838
He wants to surprise us

48:40.000 --> 48:42.798
- I don't like this!
- Take us to the movies?

48:43.040 --> 48:45.270
- What's playing?
- Paris Is Ours

48:45.520 --> 48:48.159
- If you're plotting...
- Rather not go?

48:48.320 --> 48:52.199
Sure, I'll go!
I've worked hard. I deserve it!

48:52.720 --> 48:56.269
But the Gaumont Theatre
doesn't like arsonists!

49:15.040 --> 49:18.635
My ice cream bar was good!
I'd never had strawberry

49:18.840 --> 49:20.512
They're not in season!

49:26.880 --> 49:30.555
She really had... how shall I say...
she had lots of...

49:30.720 --> 49:34.633
- That's all you ever notice!
- Lots of class!

49:38.240 --> 49:41.915
- I liked that movie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't funny

49:42.560 --> 49:45.438
Not funny? But it had depth!

49:45.760 --> 49:47.512
- What?
- Depth!

49:49.280 --> 49:50.713
- The movie!
- Yeah...

49:55.680 --> 49:57.557
It's time for bed

49:57.720 --> 49:59.358
Beddy-bye!

50:03.360 --> 50:06.716
It's Satan's general and his staff!

50:09.760 --> 50:11.955
Your mom's got nice legs, eh?

50:22.880 --> 50:26.077
Back to our happy hearth...
but a little smoky!

50:26.240 --> 50:28.435
The garbage, honey!

50:29.120 --> 50:32.510
I hope I won't regret
trying to win him over

51:19.680 --> 51:20.430
Doinel!

51:20.600 --> 51:24.229
If your essay is first today
it's because I've decided...

51:24.400 --> 51:27.517
to rank them
by starting from the bottom

51:27.680 --> 51:31.275
Your search for the absolute
led you straight to a zero

51:31.480 --> 51:33.789
For you who don't know Balzac...

51:33.960 --> 51:36.793
it concerns A Gloomy Affair

51:36.960 --> 51:39.713
Doinel has the right to take

51:39.880 --> 51:42.838
the death of a relative
as his subject...

51:43.000 --> 51:45.594
although we know
he easily sacrifices his dear ones

51:45.760 --> 51:47.318
whenever convenient

51:47.480 --> 51:48.993
I didn't copy, sir!

51:49.400 --> 51:50.958
Listen to this!

51:51.600 --> 51:53.670
Suddenly the dying man rose up...

51:53.840 --> 51:56.877
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

51:57.040 --> 52:00.635
His hair stood on end
and his eyebrows arched

52:00.800 --> 52:03.439
His face brightened
with a sublime look

52:03.600 --> 52:08.674
He shouted Archimedes' famous
word... Eureka! I've found it!

52:08.920 --> 52:10.638
Well, I found it too!

52:10.960 --> 52:13.872
- You plagiarist!
- It's not true!

52:14.080 --> 52:16.640
Take your essay at once
to the principal

52:16.800 --> 52:18.313
Colombel, go with him

52:20.560 --> 52:22.551
And stay out
till the end of the term!

52:34.400 --> 52:35.674
What's with you?

52:37.280 --> 52:39.840
I sat next to him.
He didn't copy it!

52:40.000 --> 52:41.558
Want to be expelled?

52:41.920 --> 52:42.796
That's OK

52:44.000 --> 52:45.558
Such impudence!

52:46.240 --> 52:49.437
- Get out!
- Expel me but don't kick me out!

52:49.600 --> 52:50.715
Out!

52:50.880 --> 52:52.472
That's illegal!

52:52.800 --> 52:56.315
I'll show you
who makes the laws here!

53:06.080 --> 53:07.672
Did you take him?

53:08.000 --> 53:09.592
- He ran away.
- Ran away?

53:14.880 --> 53:18.236
I slugged him and ran

53:20.760 --> 53:21.909
And you?

53:22.080 --> 53:24.958
He threw me out
till after Christmas

53:30.400 --> 53:33.631
Now I really can't go home.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.711
Dad said
he'd put me in an academy

53:35.880 --> 53:38.872
- What's that?
- Something military

53:39.200 --> 53:41.589
You'd have a uniform and a future

53:41.760 --> 53:43.671
No thanks!

53:44.000 --> 53:45.911
If only it were the Navy!

53:46.240 --> 53:48.674
I'd like to see the ocean.

53:48.840 --> 53:50.717
I've seen the Channel,
the Atlantic...

53:50.880 --> 53:53.599
and the Mediterranean
but not the North Sea

53:53.880 --> 53:56.155
Stay at my house. We'll manage!

54:22.080 --> 54:24.036
Holy cow! A horse!

54:24.960 --> 54:26.791
It's my dad's. A souvenir!

54:28.800 --> 54:30.711
What a huge place!

54:32.480 --> 54:35.358
Clean off the sofa.
You can sleep here

54:35.680 --> 54:36.954
And your parents?

54:37.280 --> 54:39.999
Never here! Mom drinks
and Dad is always...

54:40.160 --> 54:42.549
at the races.
This place is wide open

54:42.720 --> 54:44.472
We need to start a business

54:44.800 --> 54:46.631
Yeah, we need money

54:46.880 --> 54:48.791
But we need some to start with

54:48.960 --> 54:50.552
In that case...

54:50.720 --> 54:53.280
I'll use part of my inheritance

54:53.440 --> 54:56.000
Quiet! Mom may be around

55:03.040 --> 55:04.758
Anyone here?

57:05.120 --> 57:07.839
- Hello, madam!
- Little devil!

57:34.880 --> 57:38.395
- Seen your mother lately?
- Today after school

57:40.200 --> 57:43.431
She makes sure
her hours never coincide with mine

57:43.680 --> 57:45.591
She must be up to something

57:47.520 --> 57:48.794
Where's the fruit?

58:11.520 --> 58:13.272
Here!

58:56.320 --> 58:58.550
Hurry up! We'll miss the news!

59:04.480 --> 59:07.677
Yeah, I know, Inspector,
you'll lock me up for life

59:08.000 --> 59:11.197
But drop by Duely's around 8:00

59:11.520 --> 59:14.273
Ya might meet a pal
with sharp teeth

59:46.240 --> 59:47.832
I'm thirsty!

59:51.680 --> 59:53.272
It's already empty!

59:53.600 --> 59:55.192
Come on! Play!

59:55.520 --> 59:57.317
You threw a 12?

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.754
It's my old man!

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.071
Help shake the blankets!

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.354
That's enough!

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.993
What's going on? It's a smokehouse!

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.879
A real gambling den!

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.390
I'll deduct 3 cigars
from your allowance

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.598
Bucephalus is not for your junk!

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.276
He's worth a million!
A work of art!

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.798
I'll never give him up
until the last minute!

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.035
Now turn out the lights
and go to sleep!

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.392
- 'Night, Pa!
- Goodnight!

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.709
- Not bad!
- By god!

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.279
Great!

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.472
Give me your Michelin

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.358
A million'd be great!

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.233
My dad would kill me
because of that horse

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.789
With a million
we'll find a beach...

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.594
open a boat business
and no one'll bother us!

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.718
- Make up your mind.
- Dad's office has some

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.236
- Don't back down!
- We can't sell it. They're numbered

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.675
- We won't sell it, we'll pawn it!
- Smart!

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.353
Ma pawned all our stuff

01:02:26.305 --> 01:02:32.277
