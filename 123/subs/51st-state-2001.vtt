16:47.900 --> 16:50.100

18:09.200 --> 18:11.300
Young man, get off the bloody green!

18:20.800 --> 18:23.200
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Round the block.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.700
Drive, quick!

18:34.600 --> 18:36.900
Let's go meet the Yankee Muppet.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.000
Where's Lawrence?
Where's he gone? We're late.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.800
- Well, he's...
- You left him at the pub. Twat!

18:44.900 --> 18:46.500
- But you said...
- Go back.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.500
Go back and get him.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.000
Look at this wanker.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.100
- Prick!
- Go on.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.600
(Sigh of relief)

19:17.800 --> 19:20.700
Lawrence says, right, he's
going to be carrying...

19:22.100 --> 19:24.200
..a load of drugs, right?

19:24.300 --> 19:26.700
We do him. Job done.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.300
OK?

19:28.500 --> 19:33.600
I'm not having some fuckin' nig-nog...
put us out of business, right?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.700
Hey!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.200
Watch it! You're pissin'
on my fuckin' boots!

19:38.300 --> 19:40.100
- What about Felix DeSouza?
- Fuck him.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.300
He's a rabid dog.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.700
Is he? Well, fuck him!

19:44.800 --> 19:46.600
Fuck him! Leave it to me!

19:46.700 --> 19:49.500
I'll rip out his fuckin' liver.
One shot. Va-voom!

19:51.200 --> 19:53.200
Yeah? No problem.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.300
No problem.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.900
Hey!

20:03.400 --> 20:06.400
Hey! Felix DeSouza.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.300
Just the wanker I wanted to deal with.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
Deal with this.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.700
What a fuckin' day.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.200
Arthur. Come in, Arthur. Over.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.100
(Static hiss)

20:23.300 --> 20:25.500
Why don't you try the
big fat button, Arthur?

20:26.600 --> 20:27.900
Yes, sir.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.700
Now, we are looking for
a large black gentleman wearing a dress.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.900
That's what Lawrence said.
It should be easy. Over.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.100
Yeah, and we want Customs
to pull him over, right?

20:38.300 --> 20:42.800
Wrong. We want Customs to let him through
and you follow him. Over.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.900
- Utter nutbag.
- Right. Over.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.400
What now?

21:04.500 --> 21:07.100
Follow them all. Over.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.400
- Madam, if you'd like to come this way.
- No. I've got to go.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.000
Have you finished?

21:34.100 --> 21:37.700
CUSTOMS OFFICER: Not quite miss
we need to look at your shoulder bag

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
Welcome to England.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.500
Actually, that makes me out to be a bit
of a liar, cos let's face it, pal,

21:56.600 --> 21:59.100
you're about as welcome
as a dose of the clap.

21:59.300 --> 22:00.900
But it's always nice to be nice.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.200
- Who the hell are you?
- Felix DeSouza.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.100
Mr. Durant sent me.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.800
- I asked for a chemist. Where's Lawrence?
- In the car.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.200
- He should be here.
- I should give a shit.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
To me, you're just a ticket to the game.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.400
Where's the chemist?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.200
Where's Lawrence?

22:26.900 --> 22:28.500
You heard him. Where's Lawrence?

22:30.200 --> 22:32.800
Put these in the truck.
Get Durant on the phone.

22:35.100 --> 22:38.000
Put these fucking sticks in the boot.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.500
Aaah!

22:44.100 --> 22:45.800
- What's that?
- It's Lawrence.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.200
I can see it's fucking Lawrence.
What happened?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.500
- You told me to take care of him.
- Oh, shit.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.100
I meant to take care of him,
not fucking take care of him.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.100
Shit.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.500
Shit.

23:00.700 --> 23:02.100
Shit!

23:02.200 --> 23:03.900
Shut the fucking thing, will you?

23:12.400 --> 23:14.300
Fuck...

23:14.400 --> 23:17.200
Get Durant on the fucking phone,
right fucking now!

23:26.400 --> 23:28.300
Where's my motherfucking chemist?!

23:28.400 --> 23:31.200
- Lawrence? He should be in the car.
- Should be?!

23:31.300 --> 23:33.100
What kind of fuck-up is this Durarnt?

23:33.200 --> 23:36.300
Look, we deal today, or I
go to the competition.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.300
Look, let me speak to DeSouza.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.100
DeSouza? DeSouza?

23:40.200 --> 23:43.200
Look, boss, it wasn't my fault.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.100
Besides, he was fucking irritating.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.300
Right now, I couldn't give a gnat's chuff.
You twat!

23:48.400 --> 23:50.100
You just make sure McElroy gets here.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.400
Where's my fucking chemist?!

23:52.500 --> 23:55.300
- Think we need a new chemist Mr. Durarnt
- I know. I know.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.500
I can fucking hear him, can't I?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.800
Tell him I'm going to get a hold of er...

23:59.900 --> 24:01.900
Pudsey Smith, OK?

24:02.100 --> 24:05.700
Yeah. I am not buying aspirin
for a fucking arm and a leg.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.400
He's getting Pudsey Smith.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.500
- Who?
- He's a deaf-mute.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.400
Stall him. Just stall him.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.500
You keep that Yankee cunt happy. And alive.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.900
All right, boss. Yeah.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.700
Oh! You fucking twat!

24:26.300 --> 24:29.300
What's the plan, then? Freshen up?

24:29.400 --> 24:33.600
Massage? Maybe you fancy
a bucket of fried fucking chicken.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.900
If I wanted cuisine, I'd
have gone to Paris.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.100
You can still go to France.
It's not too far.

24:38.200 --> 24:41.700
It's full of pricks and they hate
fucking Yanks too. Do you fancy a bite?

24:41.800 --> 24:44.000
Yeah. All right.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.800
Hello, stranger!

24:58.400 --> 25:01.300
Said hello to lover boy yet?

25:01.400 --> 25:04.500
- (Laughs)
- Iki, I'm in a hurry.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.000
Can we get on with it?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.700
Ruger mini-14, 223 calibre.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.800
It comes in a fetching chrome.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.700
20 rounds per banana.

25:24.800 --> 25:29.200
Unless the elite and snazzy Iki special takes
your fancy, extending your capacity to 40.

25:29.300 --> 25:32.500
- We've got a Czechoslovakian...
- CZ 83, I'll take one.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.000
Oh...

25:34.200 --> 25:36.900
Well, that's young Felix's
weapon of choice, isn't it?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.100
Now, there's a trip down memory lane.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.800
I'm partial to a bit of sentiment, me.

25:41.900 --> 25:44.700
I've heard things, you know. He misses you.

25:46.300 --> 25:47.800
So, what are you going to take?

25:48.000 --> 25:52.400
I'll take the Baretta, the CZ, an ankle
holster, add the mini-14 and I'm done.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.000
- I want to get in and out fast.
- Don't we all?

25:55.100 --> 25:57.800
Does Durant still do his
deals at the Port Hotel?

25:57.900 --> 26:00.400
Silly lad. It'll be his
undoing, one of these days.

26:00.500 --> 26:03.900
But what do you expect from a fella
who gets his arse waxed every month?

26:04.000 --> 26:07.500
I forgot what a circus this place is.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.200
Funny, that.

26:09.300 --> 26:13.400
I never did much like the circus. All that
poking your head in a lion's mouth shite.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.800
Bring on the horses!
Get 'em rogering the dancing girls!

26:16.900 --> 26:18.900
That's a circus.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.600
These... and these

26:21.800 --> 26:23.400
are on the house.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.700
Welcome home,... Dawn.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.900
- There you go, mate.
- Thanks, mate.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.600
Ta.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.400
What the fuck did they do to this fish?
Batter it to death?

26:53.500 --> 26:55.700
Fish and chips. The national dish, mate.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.500
More like a national disaster.

Twat.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Come on.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.700
So, er...

27:45.800 --> 27:48.500
How much are they paying you
to wear that skirt?

27:55.900 --> 27:57.900
Fag?

28:01.300 --> 28:03.300
No, motherfucker.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.900
(Sniggers)

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
(Knock at door)

28:21.000 --> 28:23.800
Ah, Mr. McElroy!

28:23.900 --> 28:26.300
That's daring, but very dashing attire.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.100
Let's stick to the business in hand.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.000
Hey, come on! Mr. McElroy's
a guest of ours.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.100
OK boys Guns on the table please

28:38.200 --> 28:39.200
Felix?

28:39.300 --> 28:41.700
I've delivered him. I'll
have my tickets and be off.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.400
OK. Put your gun on the table.

28:43.500 --> 28:47.300
- Fuck. The game's tomorrow.
- Put your fucking gun on the table, you gobshite!

28:48.900 --> 28:50.900
What?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.400
- So, who's the chemist?
- This is Pudsey Smith.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.700
A first-class man.
Qualified and everything.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.600
He can't talk. He's been shot.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.200
Felix, have you shit your
pants, or something?

29:10.300 --> 29:12.300
Something doesn't feel right, Mr. Durant.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.400
I know. You're making me nervous, for fuck's
sake! Sit on your hands, or something.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.200
OK, Mr. McElroy, the ball's in your court.

29:29.800 --> 29:33.100
McELROY: MDMA utilises serotonin

29:33.200 --> 29:36.500
Opiates like heroin utilise dopamine

29:36.600 --> 29:40.200
Sort of like the same
sensation you get after sex.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.700
Amphetamines increase adrenaline

29:42.900 --> 29:48.000
and cocaine gets those synapses
in the brain firing really fast.

29:48.100 --> 29:52.300
My product is 51 times
stronger than cocaine.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.700
51 times more hallucinogenic than acid

29:55.800 --> 29:58.700
and 51 times more explosive than ecstasy.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.200
It's like a personal visit...

30:02.600 --> 30:04.200
..from God.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.200
It's that good?

30:09.600 --> 30:12.300
The dog's bollocks.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.100
Felix DeSouza.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.700
- I count ten.
- That's right.

30:38.900 --> 30:43.000
That's one million sterling,
or 1... 1.6 million dollars.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.300
But that ain't what we agreed on, is it?

30:45.400 --> 30:48.200
You're 18.4 million dollars shy.

30:48.400 --> 30:52.100
And I don't care how you cut it,
that's a whole lot shy.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.200
No...

30:54.300 --> 30:57.100
Mr. McElroy, what we have there
is a goodwill gesture.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.800
A deposit. A down payment.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.500
One and a half million's
not a bad start, is it?

31:01.600 --> 31:06.600
I need to do some research. I need to feed a
few thousand to the kids, get some feedback.

31:06.800 --> 31:10.000
You don't think I can allow you
to walk out of here with $20 million

31:10.100 --> 31:12.200
for a formula that only
exists in your head?

31:12.300 --> 31:14.900
And all I get is what?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
An ointment for toe jam.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.800
Uh-huh?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.400
- Market research.
- Right.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.700
Profile customers, send out questionnaires.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.900
Get out the bloody way, Felix.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.600
I can dig that. But unless you've got what
we agreed on, what the fuck am I doing here?

31:38.700 --> 31:41.000
Give me a call when you're ready to deal.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.600
(Banging on door)
- I fucking knew it.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.200
(Quavery voice) Room service.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.300
That old fuckin' chestnut.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.700
Aaargh!

31:53.900 --> 31:55.600
Hey hold it fellas!

31:55.700 --> 31:58.400
It's my sausage and flamin' mash!

31:58.500 --> 32:00.800
- (Screams)
- Ssh...

32:00.900 --> 32:04.000
Sorry, love. Sorry about that, pet.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.100
It's just that er...

32:06.200 --> 32:08.100
my dad ran off with a room service maid.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.700
Things have never really
been the same since.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.600
Bollocks.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.400
(Phone rings)

32:19.700 --> 32:21.000
Now's not a good time.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.000
- Change of plan
- What do you mean?

32:23.100 --> 32:24.700
I want McElroy kept alive.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.400
I don't do alive, I do dead.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.100
It's a matter of $20 million

32:28.200 --> 32:29.900
in cash being vaporised,

32:30.100 --> 32:33.400
and it's a matter of a lot of anger
being directed at The Lizard man.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.100
You now do alive.

32:35.200 --> 32:39.400
My future is inside McEroy's skull

32:39.500 --> 32:42.500
You waste anything
and everybody that gets near him.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.400
You waste them, not him.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.700
His mind belongs to The Lizard

32:48.800 --> 32:50.600
Shit.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.100
Fucking hell!

33:02.300 --> 33:04.300
Shit, shit, shit!

33:12.000 --> 33:13.600
Arsehole.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.400
Let go, you double-crosser.
Let go! They're mine!

33:18.900 --> 33:19.900
Oh!

33:32.200 --> 33:33.800
Oh, shit.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.400
Shit.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.400
Ow! Shit!

34:00.500 --> 34:03.100
I told you to get out of the way, Felix.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.200
- Fuck! I've been shot.
- Where?

34:05.300 --> 34:07.200
In the fucking arse!

34:07.400 --> 34:09.600
Man, it's just a flesh wound. Come on.

34:09.700 --> 34:13.300
Flesh wound? Is that supposed
to sound like a fuckin' good thing?

34:17.600 --> 34:19.600
(Arguing)

34:19.700 --> 34:22.000
Come on, dude.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.500
Oi, sooty.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.300
Sooty!

34:29.200 --> 34:30.600
Here. Take these.

34:42.300 --> 34:44.400
- Aaargh!
- Oh, fuck!

34:44.600 --> 34:47.000
Fuckin' get him, boys. Come on!

34:52.000 --> 34:55.700
- Stay down, bitch.
- Oi! You're not driving my car!

34:55.800 --> 34:57.000
Shit.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.000
Give me the fuckin' keys. Get in the car.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.200
Fuck!

35:08.600 --> 35:10.400
BOTH: Aaargh!

35:13.800 --> 35:15.100
Fucking hell!

35:16.200 --> 35:18.800
Get your fat arse out of the flamin' car.
Check the hotel.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.700
Put me in the picture.
What the fuck happened back there?

35:21.900 --> 35:23.800
I just got shot in the fucking arse

35:23.900 --> 35:26.900
- is what happened!
- This is not how we do fuckin' business.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.600
- Just get out of the fucking car!
- All right. All right.

35:29.700 --> 35:30.700
Oh, fuck!

35:36.200 --> 35:38.500
What the fuck are you doing?

35:38.600 --> 35:40.300
Woah...

35:42.000 --> 35:43.500
Just take a fucking left!

35:46.400 --> 35:47.900
(Siren)

35:53.200 --> 35:54.900
- Get off the pavement!
- Shit.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.300
Watch out!

35:57.400 --> 35:59.400
Fuck!

36:01.100 --> 36:03.100
- Which fucking way?
- Right. Right.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.900
- Come on!
- Aargh. Christ!

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Hey

36:24.700 --> 36:27.100
- The traffic's coming from the right.
- I got it.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.000
Fuck!

36:38.200 --> 36:40.200
You! Out of my fuckin' way!

36:50.000 --> 36:51.700
- Oh, bollocks.
- The dog's bollocks?

36:52.600 --> 36:54.100
No. Just plain fucking bollocks.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.700
- No dogs involved?
- No!

36:56.600 --> 36:58.300
Watch out! Watch out!

37:02.200 --> 37:03.800
You'll kill the fucking car!

37:09.400 --> 37:11.700
Fuck.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.000
Oh! Fuck.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.100
(Siren)

37:22.900 --> 37:24.200
Hello?

37:37.200 --> 37:39.200
So, let me get this straight.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.600
"Bollocks" is bad,
whereas "the dog's bollocks" is good, huh?

37:42.800 --> 37:44.500
Yeah.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.300
(Engine revs)

37:47.500 --> 37:49.000
Oh, bollocks.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.500
Gotcha.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.200
Come on, then!

38:12.300 --> 38:13.300
Come on!

38:14.600 --> 38:19.500
Aaa-aargh!

38:22.600 --> 38:25.500
- Stop.
- God. Fucking Yanks.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.800
Come on!

38:32.200 --> 38:33.200
Shit.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.900
Fucking hell.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Scraping my fucking paintwork!

38:40.000 --> 38:42.400
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.700
- Fuck you, Kane, you shitebag.
- Fuck off!

38:47.100 --> 38:50.400
(Squawks like a chicken)

38:50.500 --> 38:51.800
Oh, you little fuck!

38:51.900 --> 38:54.300
Chicken bollocks.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.800
Shit!

38:57.900 --> 38:59.900
Whoa-oa!

39:02.300 --> 39:04.600
Fuck you, Kane, you fucking wanker!

39:04.700 --> 39:07.100
(Sirens)

39:34.500 --> 39:36.600
Come here, you!

39:36.800 --> 39:38.400
- Are you all right?
- Fuck off!

39:41.700 --> 39:44.000
We've lost them.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.400
(Ship's horn)

39:48.500 --> 39:51.900
Yeah, well, let's not take any chances.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
Oh...

40:16.900 --> 40:19.200
Oh, shit!

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Ugh...

40:39.700 --> 40:41.400
Are you wanting to junk that, pal?

40:41.500 --> 40:42.500
You what?

40:42.600 --> 40:45.400
Dude, do you have a car that works?
I need transportation.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.400
I've got a Cooper needing a lick of paint.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.200
She goes. Throw in the XJ6
and she's yours for a 100 quid.

40:51.300 --> 40:55.200
- Deal.
- What, a Cooper? Piss off, Popeye. And you.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.500
I'll tell you what 70, quid and the Jag

40:57.700 --> 40:59.300
and I'm robbing myself.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.000
Tha... that's it. That's it.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.900
I've had just about enough of this shite

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I got you to that deal in one piece.

41:07.100 --> 41:09.100
I got you out of that deal in one piece.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.300
As far as I'm concerned, my job's done.
It's finished.

41:12.500 --> 41:16.100
You can leave my motor alone, get your
golf clubs, and fuck off back to Dixie.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.700
Pay attention, Felix DeSouza.

41:18.900 --> 41:23.400
I atomised a major drugs syndicate
to be here this morning.

41:23.600 --> 41:28.200
Now, I'm stuck in
Liver-fucking-fool with you!

41:28.300 --> 41:34.500
And if I need you to sell your car to
help me, you will sell your goddamn car!

41:41.400 --> 41:43.600
Do I look like the Salvation Army?

41:43.700 --> 41:46.700
Have I got Jim'll Fix It
written on my fucking hat?

41:46.900 --> 41:50.500
I'm sorry, mate, but help's not a word
I'm too familiar with, you know.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.600
(Camptown Races ringtone)

41:57.200 --> 41:58.300
Fuck off!

42:20.500 --> 42:22.500
I don't believe it.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
So, who's the girl?

42:29.300 --> 42:31.800
It's my ex-girlfriend.

42:35.500 --> 42:39.000
Arthur. I want you to
describe the situation to me.

42:39.200 --> 42:42.500
Seven shades of shit in a
one-shit trumpet, sir.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.300
It looks like some kind of a drugs buy.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.000
None of your ordinary

42:47.200 --> 42:50.600
Aye aye. Got some blue tabs.
They look like sweets.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.800
How are you?

42:52.900 --> 42:56.100
What do you mean, how am I?
Nearly cut my fucking ear off!

42:56.200 --> 42:58.200
And I've hurt my knee.

42:58.300 --> 43:03.400
Now, I want you to get the pills and take
them straight down to the lab, double time.

43:03.500 --> 43:07.400
You got that? And then you call me.
Now, what else have you got?

43:08.300 --> 43:09.800
Six dead bodies and one live one.

43:09.900 --> 43:12.400
- (Groans)
- Chief, it's Leopold Durant.

43:12.600 --> 43:15.900
Durant? Right. Now, concentrate, Arthur.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.900
Get that fat fuck down here pronto.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.500
But, sir, he's dying.

43:21.700 --> 43:24.700
Then you'd better be fucking
quick about it, hadn't you?

43:25.800 --> 43:26.800
(Foghorn)

43:29.500 --> 43:31.500
She dumped me.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.200
Two years ago now.

43:37.300 --> 43:40.000
Changed her name from Dawn to Dakota.

43:40.100 --> 43:42.800
Fucked off for Las Vegas
and a deck of cards.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.200
So who hired her to take me out?

43:45.300 --> 43:47.600
You're asking the wrong question, mate.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.700
She's your guardian angel.

43:54.100 --> 43:56.700
If she wanted you dead you'd be dead

43:56.900 --> 43:58.900
She never misses.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I mean, fucking look at that.

44:02.300 --> 44:07.400
If she really wanted to hit me... I'd be
shiteing through a tube for the rest of my life.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.900
Someone wants you kept alive.

44:20.100 --> 44:24.500
Somebody's trying to cut in on
Durant's deal. They're shitting again.

44:24.600 --> 44:27.000
- Yeah, well, shit happens.
- No

44:27.100 --> 44:29.500
Shit don't just happen, shit takes time.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.600
Shit takes effort.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.900
$20 million-worth of effort.

44:34.900 --> 44:36.500
(Metallic ping)

44:36.600 --> 44:39.000
I've got to get a new deal on, fast.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.800
You know the town, you know the players.

44:41.900 --> 44:43.600
Look...

44:45.500 --> 44:47.500
..all I want is a ticket for the game.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.600
Do you think you can swing that?

44:49.700 --> 44:53.300
$20 million could swing anything.
You know what I'm selling.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.400
Well, how much?

44:55.500 --> 44:58.400
5% of whatever I get out
of any deal you set up.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
That's a million dollars.

45:00.600 --> 45:03.800
Hell, you could buy your own
goddamn stadium with that.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.100
- Game's tomorrow.
- You'd better get started, then.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.300
Oh, and Felix.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.000
A word of advice.

45:16.100 --> 45:19.900
You ever want to get the girl,
you've got to broaden your horizons.

45:22.700 --> 45:24.900
(Distant metallic ping)

45:27.900 --> 45:29.900
KANE: What the fuck is that?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
What is it?

45:32.100 --> 45:34.100
What? Scotch mist?

45:35.700 --> 45:38.000
Now, now, now, now, now.

45:38.200 --> 45:40.800
You are getting greedy, Leopold.

45:41.900 --> 45:47.900
It's a big deal going down, and you are
trying to cut me out of the fucking loop.

45:48.100 --> 45:52.800
- (Leopold screams in agony)
- I told you. Face the fuck front!

45:54.600 --> 45:56.700
(Coughs and chokes)

45:56.900 --> 45:58.600
This is going to cost you

45:58.800 --> 46:01.300
an additional 15%.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.700
No?

46:02.900 --> 46:04.500
All right, then. 30.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.200
As you're being so difficult.

46:06.300 --> 46:11.000
How about this?
50-50. Why settle for anything less, eh?

46:13.100 --> 46:15.100
60-40.

46:15.200 --> 46:21.800
Leopold, I don't know if you noticed, my son,
but you're in urgent need of a fucking doctor.

46:23.300 --> 46:25.300
50-50.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.300
Good boy.

46:28.700 --> 46:31.300
All right, then, Arthur. Take him down.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.300
(Shouts)

46:35.500 --> 46:37.200
Argh!

46:37.400 --> 46:39.500
Fuck!

46:41.900 --> 46:47.600
You really have excelled yourself this time,
haven't you, Arthur? Brilliant. Fucking brilliant.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.200
Eastern meditation music

46:59.800 --> 47:02.500
Omar, it's my own interpretation, innit?

47:02.600 --> 47:05.600
- You need to find your centre.
- Get off my leg!

47:05.700 --> 47:08.200
- Find your centre.
- Stop messing... Omar!

47:09.300 --> 47:14.000
Omar, you're messing with
my delicate energy field here, all right?

47:14.200 --> 47:15.800
OK, OK.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.200
- Cocksucker.
- Find your centre, Omar.

47:19.400 --> 47:20.800
(Mobile rings)

47:21.900 --> 47:23.000
Hello?

47:23.100 --> 47:25.400
You've got one chance, mate - yes or no -

47:25.500 --> 47:29.100
to be the number one shite
in this particular cesspool.

47:29.200 --> 47:33.600
Bugger me sideways. Felix DeSouza, you
misguided wanker. I'm already number one.

47:33.700 --> 47:36.100
Iki: Always was a bit of a pock
- Leo Durarnt

47:36.200 --> 47:38.100
- Now he's a dead pock
- Dead?

47:38.300 --> 47:41.300
(Mobile rings)
- Hang on, Felix. It's my other line.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.600
Hello?

47:44.700 --> 47:46.300
I need to find Felix.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.400
Hello, Dawn.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.700
Time to scratch that itch, is it?

47:51.800 --> 47:53.900
Well, he's gnawing my fucking wigwam.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.700
- Where does he hang out these days?
- Hang on a minute, Dawn.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.800
Felix...

47:58.900 --> 48:00.900
Listen, me and er...

48:01.000 --> 48:03.700
My associate and I
have selected you to deal with.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.500
Well, aren't I just the
luckiest bugger alive?

48:07.600 --> 48:10.000
- Stay there.
- I don't fucking believe it.

48:11.500 --> 48:14.800
- Have you tried Re-Fresh, Pink Factor?
- Yeah, all of them.

48:14.900 --> 48:17.600
Hang on a minute, tiger.
Just let me deal with this.

48:17.700 --> 48:19.700
Let me talk to him.

48:20.900 --> 48:22.900
McELROY: The deal is $20 million

48:23.000 --> 48:26.600
The deal is non-negotiable.
The deal expires at midnight.

48:26.700 --> 48:31.500
Oh, Mr. McElroy, 20 million
sounds fannytastic. Yes!

48:32.700 --> 48:37.800
Negotiation's for arsewipes. If you're not
here by midnight, I'll shit myself with woe.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.600
I want samples, Mr. McElroy.
Supersonic samples.

48:40.700 --> 48:46.100
I want frost, I want 100,000 miles an hour
of intergalactic spaciness. See ya.

48:46.300 --> 48:48.300
We in the house.

48:50.200 --> 48:52.100
Iki: Hya Daw Sorry to keep you

48:52.300 --> 48:54.700
There might be one person
who knows where he is.

49:01.500 --> 49:02.900
Fuck.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.900
What the fuck is that?

49:09.100 --> 49:12.500
FELIX: Congratulations pal
That's your new Cooper

49:12.600 --> 49:14.600
Mini Cooper.

49:15.900 --> 49:17.900
(Splutters and backfires)

49:22.200 --> 49:24.600
Have I got to sort out
every fucking problem?

49:24.700 --> 49:27.400
A laboratory. Or as you
would say, a lab-oratree.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.500
We need a lab, Felix.

49:29.700 --> 49:34.300
I'm sure that's dead easy where you come
from. Fucking lab on every corner, is it?

49:44.900 --> 49:47.800
(Horns blare)

49:47.900 --> 49:49.300
Piss off.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.200
DILLARD & CLARKE: Don't Be Cruel

50:02.300 --> 50:04.300

50:17.800 --> 50:21.500
Well, shit in a bag and punch it.
She's back.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.600
I need to find Felix.

50:26.700 --> 50:29.900
And what do you need from me?
A map and a fucking compass?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Shirley...

50:32.100 --> 50:35.700
You broke his heart.
Did you even give a thought about that?

50:35.900 --> 50:39.000
- This was a mistake.
- Most sensible thing you've said.

50:41.500 --> 50:44.000
Are you still shooting people for a living?

50:44.100 --> 50:47.200
What kind of fucking
career is that, then, eh?

50:50.200 --> 50:53.900
- Look, can I come in?
- And do what? The dirty stop-out

50:54.000 --> 50:56.100
doesn't come home till breakfast.

50:58.400 --> 51:00.800
Really good to be home.

51:06.300 --> 51:09.200
It's great to see you again, love.

51:10.800 --> 51:14.500
♪ Baby, it's still you I'm thinking of ♪

51:14.600 --> 51:16.900
♪ Don't be cruel ♪

51:17.100 --> 51:19.100
♪ To a heart that's true... ♪

51:19.200 --> 51:21.200
(Engine roars and splutters)

51:29.100 --> 51:31.100
I wanted to see the world.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.500
Liverpool isn't the world.

51:36.100 --> 51:39.900
I couldn't take America.
It was like fucking Albania in neon.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.100
And that stupid football shirt.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.100
What kind of man jumps into bed shouting,
"Come on, you Reds"?

51:48.200 --> 51:50.400
She made me laugh.

51:54.300 --> 51:56.300
Good shag, though.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.800
I tell you, she'd kill anyone for me,
I'll say that for her.

51:59.900 --> 52:01.500
He's got problems.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.100
She's got problems.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.400
Shouldn't have come back.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.100
Better off.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I need everything on this list.

52:17.200 --> 52:20.300
I'm dying for a smoke.
You haven't any ciggies, have you?

52:20.400 --> 52:23.100
I'm sorry. Cigarettes are
bad for your health.

52:23.200 --> 52:26.800
So's a fucking punch in the throat.
I need fucking nicotine now!

52:26.900 --> 52:30.000
No need to shout at me.
I'm Pakistani, not deaf.

52:31.100 --> 52:34.700
- Take a puff on this!
- Oh, fuck off.

52:34.900 --> 52:36.300
You?

52:37.400 --> 52:41.800
You! Dress-wearing er... monkey-boy.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.200
SKINHEADS: Monkey-boy!

52:44.300 --> 52:47.800
You're going to take them drugs of yours
and make it work for us.

52:47.900 --> 52:52.200
- And where would I do this?
- In my lab.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.500
- You got a lab?
- Yeah, of course.

52:55.900 --> 52:58.600
What do you take us for?
Rank fucking amateurs?

52:58.800 --> 53:01.600
(Skinheads laugh)

53:04.700 --> 53:06.700
Thrash metal

53:13.500 --> 53:15.000
Come on!

53:17.300 --> 53:18.900
(Screeching and whooping)

53:24.500 --> 53:26.500
Just say no.

53:26.700 --> 53:29.000
FELIX: How the fuck did we end up in here?

53:29.100 --> 53:32.100
One little mistake... 30 years ago.

53:42.300 --> 53:44.700
All of these items are over-the-counter.

53:44.900 --> 53:46.900
Nothing illegal here.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
You're no fucking help, are you?

53:49.100 --> 53:54.200
I beg to differ. You see, it's not the ingredients
themselves which determine the effect

53:54.300 --> 53:56.600
but the manner in which they're combined.

53:56.700 --> 53:58.700
These kids are getting very smart.

54:03.300 --> 54:05.300
He's right.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.500
The ravers are the key.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.600
Aren't you the clever little chunky monkey?

54:10.800 --> 54:14.200
You keep banging on about my weight.
You're crossing a line.

54:14.300 --> 54:16.300
Arthur, it was a joke.

54:16.500 --> 54:18.800
It was a joke. Smile.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Smile.

54:21.100 --> 54:22.700
You fat cunt.

54:24.900 --> 54:26.900
Yo, Blowjob.

54:27.100 --> 54:32.800
P-O-S 51. Comes in blue or race-car red.

54:32.900 --> 54:35.800
Destination: stratosphere.

54:38.500 --> 54:42.700
Only, this one gets you
there in 60 seconds.

54:42.800 --> 54:45.000
You try one first.

54:45.100 --> 54:47.100
Thought you'd never ask.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.700
P-O-S 51?

55:03.800 --> 55:05.800
You can't call it that.

55:05.900 --> 55:09.300
Punters'll feel like right tits
asking for tabs of 438 I-O-U,

55:09.400 --> 55:13.400
whatever the number is. No-one's
going to know what they're on about.

55:13.600 --> 55:17.500
These scumbags spend their entire life
smacked out of their heads.

55:17.700 --> 55:21.200
Numbers - they couldn't even tell you
what fucking time it is.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.300
All right, Mr. Smug, what have you done?

55:29.500 --> 55:31.800
I think the shit's about to hit the fan.

55:46.900 --> 55:50.700
Arrrrrgh!

55:51.900 --> 55:53.900
(Farting)

55:54.000 --> 55:55.600
Phew. Eurgh.

55:58.700 --> 56:01.100
(Farts)

56:01.200 --> 56:04.300
- (All groan and fart)
- Curry was a bad idea, lads.

56:05.700 --> 56:07.700
(Skinheads groan)

56:09.900 --> 56:11.500
(Farting)
- Oh yeah

56:11.700 --> 56:14.300
ALL: Please. Please.

56:14.500 --> 56:16.600
(Farting and squelching)

56:18.700 --> 56:21.300
BLOWFISH: Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks.

Nice skirt. Special occasion, is it?

Not one ingredient is found on any known
government's banned substance watch list.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.900
Hell, you can ship super
tankers of this shit.

58:42.000 --> 58:46.600
You can even lay a goddamn pipeline
and no-one would bat an eye.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.400
P-O-S 51.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.100
It's all that.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.900
And it can be yours.

59:00.100 --> 59:02.900
If the price... is right.

59:25.100 --> 59:28.700
Chemistry... Mr. McElroy.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.900
What is chemistry...

59:34.200 --> 59:38.000
..but the ability to attract
adoration in others?

59:43.700 --> 59:46.300
You see, you're like me, Mr. McElroy.

59:46.400 --> 59:49.900
You're a sky-highatrist,
I'm a sky-highatrist.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.400
See always knew'd be a drug dealer
even when was a kid

59:53.500 --> 59:56.300
saw my dad hit my mother
my mother hit my brother

59:56.500 --> 59:59.200
my brother hit my sister,
and my sister fuck my father.

59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.100
So it's inevitable, really.

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:05.200
You'd have to be on drugs just to
live in that madhouse, wouldn't you?

1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:08.300
Drugs are good, Mr. McElroy.

1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:11.500
Drugs are our mates.

1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:17.000
Fuck. I'm getting on my own nerves.

1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:21.500
What I'm trying to say to you, Mr.
McElroy, is...

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:28.700
..I'm very much attracted
to what you have to offer.

1:00:28.900 --> 1:00:31.400
(Iki chuckles)

1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:43.400
How are you doing, Felix?

1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:46.500
Well, my boss is dead...

1:00:47.700 --> 1:00:50.100
..can't get a ticket for tomorrow's match,

1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:53.500
and, oh, yeah,
I've got a fucking bullet hole in the arse.

1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:56.500
Apart from that,

1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:58.600
I'm tiptop.

1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:04.300
So who's the target?

1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:07.100
You've got that look in your eye.

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:09.200
I've been looking for you

1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:13.200
Oh, yeah? For old times' sake
or for the company I keep?

1:01:13.300 --> 1:01:15.400
Little bit of both.

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:20.200
So, you have got me on your list, then?

1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:23.500
You've always been on my list.

1:01:26.100 --> 1:01:28.700
- (Whooping and cheering)
- 40 years ago

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:33.300
a rock-and-roll revolution
was launched in this town.

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:34.800
(Wild cheering)

1:01:34.900 --> 1:01:39.100
Tonight, we're going to
launch a new revolution.

1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:46.600
One that will rock and roll your senses.

1:01:46.700 --> 1:01:48.200
(Cheering)

1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:52.200
And you... are my test pilots.

1:01:52.400 --> 1:02:00.000
You're going to kiss the sun
and taste the motherfuckin' rainbow.

1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:04.000
(Wild cheering)

1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:08.900
- Are you ready?
- (Cheering)

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.400
- Are... you... ready?
- (Cheering)

1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:19.100
Then let's get ready to party-y-y-y.

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:23.900
THRILLSEEKERS: Synaesthesia (Fly Away)

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.400
Have you any idea how much I missed you?

1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:07.100
Why didn't you stay with me, then?

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:09.900
What, me? in America? Don't be soft!

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.900
Besides, I don't know who
you are any more, girl.

1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:17.100
It's been nearly two years.
I haven't heard a word.

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:22.200
Still...

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:25.100
I always hoped...

1:03:28.900 --> 1:03:30.900
..you might...

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:32.700
change your mind...

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:36.400
..and come home.

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:41.600
We could have a fresh start.

1:03:45.300 --> 1:03:47.300
Aren't you going to say anything?

1:04:16.700 --> 1:04:20.000
This, Mr. McElroy, is a fucking miracle.

1:04:20.100 --> 1:04:25.200
Drug use will reach epidemic proportions,
revolutions will break out, governments will fall!

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:28.800
20 million, and not a penny less!

1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:31.200
- Where do I sign?
- Si... Sign?!

1:04:31.300 --> 1:04:33.300
This ain't some written contract.

1:04:33.500 --> 1:04:36.700
The kind of agreement I could take
you to court and sue your ass over.

1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:38.800
You fuck me on this deal,

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.200
I gotta take out a contract just to
get even on the goddamn contract!

1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:45.400
We think we have an agreement,
we think we see things the same way.

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:46.800
Either we do, or we don't.

1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:48.600
You're either in, or you're out.

1:04:48.700 --> 1:04:51.500
You give me the money, I give
you the formula. Are we clear?

1:04:52.700 --> 1:04:56.300
Crystal, Mr. McElroy. Crystal.

1:04:56.400 --> 1:04:59.500
I'm not Leo Durant. I'm a man of my word.

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:01.700
Get in my way,

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:03.900
and I'm gonna have to shoot you.

1:05:06.500 --> 1:05:08.900
Get in my way,
and I'm gonna have to shoot you again.

1:05:10.700 --> 1:05:12.700
I've got to work, babe.

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:18.700
Fucking cow!

1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:24.100
(Screaming)

1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.200
Oh, fuck!

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:32.900
Can't a brother just
deal some goddamn drugs?

1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:38.200
Time to go, Elmo.

1:05:53.700 --> 1:05:56.300
Mr. Kane. Is it that time
of the month already?

1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:59.900
I thought you weren't due till next week,
you eager beaver.

1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:11.500
Now, ain't that always the way?

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:14.300
Elevator music, a nigger in a kilt,

1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:17.400
and a chick with a nickel-plated nine.

1:06:17.500 --> 1:06:19.500
(Mobile rings)

1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:23.500
And now a word from our sponsor.

1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:25.600
That ain't no Liverpool accent.

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000
- Say hello, Elmo.
- Hello, Elmo.

1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:32.500
Absence makes the heart grow fonder Elmo

1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:35.400
And The Lizard so full of

1:06:35.500 --> 1:06:37.500
motherfucking fonderence for you

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:42.300
that he got on this plane
just to come see you.

1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:44.100
I'm touched.

1:06:44.300 --> 1:06:46.600
- You will be.
- You got my cash?

1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:49.500
You're flush, sweetcakes. You are flush.

1:06:50.700 --> 1:06:53.900
He's looking forward to seeing you.

1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:09.100
So, what's the price tag on my ass?

1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:11.200
It's enough. Move.

1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:22.900
(Screams)

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:29.000
Last stop. There's nowhere
from here but down.

1:07:29.100 --> 1:07:30.600
Reel me in!

1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:33.000
Why would I dream of doing
a stupid thing like that?

1:07:33.100 --> 1:07:36.200
- Pull me up, will you?
- Fold or call?

1:07:36.300 --> 1:07:40.400
- What?
- You play poker. Fold or call?

1:07:40.500 --> 1:07:42.600
- (Whimpers)
- I'm your last chance, girl.

1:07:42.700 --> 1:07:44.900
I'm that out you've been looking for.

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.900
I'm only gonna make this offer once.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.500
You either take it
and get out from under The Lizard's ass

1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:53.400
or you stay a slave
and wonder where your life went.

1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:56.700
You think you can save me, do you?
Look where you are!

1:07:56.900 --> 1:08:00.300
- Get real!
- A million in bonds, untraceable.

1:08:00.500 --> 1:08:03.300
That's real! That's a fresh start.

1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:07.100
Try quitting while you're ahead
for a change... Dawn.

1:08:07.300 --> 1:08:09.300
- No.
- No?!

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:11.500
(Screams)

1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:15.500
I want 10% of your deal with Iki.

1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:17.200
You're negotiating with me?!

1:08:17.300 --> 1:08:18.900
Look at your options.

1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:23.100
10%.

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:25.400
Have a look at yours.

1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:31.200
All right.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:32.600
(Screams)

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.700
Now that is a lovely dress.

1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:47.300
Need the extra room, do you?

1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:49.300
Tell me something. I'm intrigued.

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:52.400
Is it true that you fellas are equipped
with incredibly...

1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:57.200
..large...

1:08:59.100 --> 1:09:00.600
Fuck!

1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:04.400
Thanks.

1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:05.800
My pleasure.

1:09:05.900 --> 1:09:07.300
You can move your arm now.

1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:14.300
KANE: Right, then you Scouse git

1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:17.400
In the last 12 hours

1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:20.700
this city has gone from a peaceful,
fun-loving, Utopia

1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:22.800
to an all-out fucking war zone.

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000
And I, Virgil Kane...

1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:28.100
Well, I want to know why.

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:33.400
Nobody cuts me out of anything
in this parochial pisshole.

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.400
You smell that, Felix. Smell it.

1:09:35.500 --> 1:09:37.900
- Smell it!
- (Sniffs)

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000
That is essence of Durant.

1:09:41.300 --> 1:09:44.100
And Durant got what he deserved.

1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:46.700
So, when a deal goes down,

1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:50.400
you, my old sausage, will fix it.
Time and place.

1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:52.700
And then you will call me.

1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:55.900
Otherwise... Accessory to murder.

1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.800
Possession of a firearm.

1:09:59.900 --> 1:10:01.700
You fuck me,

1:10:01.900 --> 1:10:03.900
I'll have you on your hands and your knees,

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.400
with your arse in the air, exposing your
rusty sheriff's badge for the next 20 years.

1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000
So ask yourself, are you
going to help restore

1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:16.500
some national pride,
and stick one on the Yanks?

1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:19.800
Or, like the rest of your life,
are you going to piss it all away?

1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.700
Are you going to help me

1:10:23.900 --> 1:10:25.500
to help you?

1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:27.600
Eight hours till kickoff.

1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:31.900
It's a big game.

1:10:33.100 --> 1:10:36.000
Let's just see if you come good.

1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:48.300
Mr. Kane.

1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:57.400
See ya! (Chuckles)

1:10:59.300 --> 1:11:02.000
- You'll never walk alone, eh, mate?
- (Laughs)

1:11:12.900 --> 1:11:15.100
(Deactivates car alarm)

1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:17.300
(Laughs)

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.100
Help me to help you? Cunt!

1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:53.800
ELMO: How do you think that motherfucker
would do against people who diss

1:11:53.900 --> 1:11:57.400
like Soso McGure Grffy?
They'd be knocking this shit out the park

1:11:57.500 --> 1:12:00.500
He can't throw that kinda heat!
Kevin? s got what's goin' on here!

1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:03.600
- You don't know what you? re taking about
DAWN: Bullshit

1:12:03.700 --> 1:12:07.200
Kevin Brown couldn't carry
Sandy Koufax's jockstrap.

1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:09.700
You've been listening to
too much Vince Scully.

1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:14.100
You need to get your ear out of the radio,
and carry your ass out to the ball game.

1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:17.700
Sorry, but er...

1:12:18.900 --> 1:12:20.500
..have I missed something?

1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:27.900
What the fuck is that?

1:12:28.100 --> 1:12:32.000
- Black pudding. Fried pig's blood.
- Oh!

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:34.700
Are you two planning on
filling me in, or what?

1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.900
Elmo's propositioned her.

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.200
Nice one, Shirley.

1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:42.800
I'm listening.

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000
Lizard offered Dakota 250K
to deliver my live ass to him.

1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:50.800
I've made her a significantly better offer.

1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:53.700
And I'm thinking... she might entertain...

1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:57.300
..certain sentimental reasons
for not doing her job.

1:12:57.400 --> 1:12:59.200
The question is

1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:02.600
whether it's going to pay me...
to be sentimental.

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.300
Look, we have a choice.

1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:15.000
We can use our "Get out
of jail free" cards,

1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:21.000
or we can choose "Stop, do not pass Go".
Do not collect 20 million dollars.

1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:24.500
Do we have a deal?

1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:32.200
Do that again, I will
definitely fucking shoot you.

1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:34.800
Shut your gob! Go and get
yourself cleaned up!

1:13:43.700 --> 1:13:45.800
- And no shagging up there!
- Yeah.

1:13:45.900 --> 1:13:48.400
No shagging up there.

1:14:01.700 --> 1:14:03.700
We do this job and we get out.

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:14.800

1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:48.200
Listen! It's got to come from your belly.

1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:50.900
Right deep down!

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000
It's your birth trauma.

1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:57.100
Now cleanse your charkas
and let it all out.

1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:02.200
(Chant)

1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:07.000
- Let it go!
- I'm trying, you fucking fairy!

1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:09.200
A-a-a-a-ah!

1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:13.400
All right? A-a-a-ah!

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:16.100
A-a-a-a-a-ah!

1:16:16.300 --> 1:16:17.900
(Mobile rings)

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.100
- All-righty. Good morning.
- All right, let's finish this deal.

1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:24.200
My sentiments exactly.

1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:28.400
- Any particular venue?
- No airports no hotel rooms

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:31.800
no dockyards, no barges, no pharmacies,

1:16:31.900 --> 1:16:33.700
- no animal-testing labs.
- Oh!

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:37.300
- No rooftops.
- Riddles! Riddles! I love riddles.

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:40.400
No abandoned warehouses or rave clubs.

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:44.700
I want total privacy

1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:47.500
in a very public place.

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:50.800
And security.

1:16:50.900 --> 1:16:53.200
Cops. Lots of them.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:56.400
And witnesses. Thousands of witnesses.

1:16:56.600 --> 1:17:00.200
- You getting my drift?
- Well er I've got a certain er

1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:04.700
business indulgence, shall we say,
that I could er... utilise.

1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:07.800
- So, what time's kickoff?
- Three o? clock sharp

1:17:07.900 --> 1:17:09.000
I'll be there.

1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:10.900
Football and drugs.

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000
A perfect Saturday afternoon.

1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:16.700
Liverpool!

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:18.800
Liverpool!

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.300
Come on!

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:21.600
Charkas!

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.200
(Fans chant)

1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:36.800
(Car horn)

1:17:41.300 --> 1:17:43.000
(Cheering)

1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:45.200
No, no, no, no, no, chubster.

1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:47.300
- You stay here.
- What for?

1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:52.700
I don't know. Keep your eyes peeled on the exit.
And try for fuck's sake to blend in, cunt!

1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:58.200
This clown better deliver.

1:17:58.300 --> 1:18:01.900
Don't worry. Iki put something like this
together a couple of years ago now.

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.600
Yeah? What happened?

1:18:03.700 --> 1:18:05.200
They all died.

1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:09.400
We get in, we get out.

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:11.500
What about the game?

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:15.600
- We're staying to watch the game, right?
- Dude, I'm in, then I'm out.

1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:30.700
TANNOY: Virgin Atlantic announce
the arrival of Flight ES12 from Los Angeles

1:18:34.300 --> 1:18:35.500
Any glass bottles?

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:38.900
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Welcome to Anfield, the home of football.

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.900
- Too right, pal.
- McElroy, DeSouza.

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.500
Yes, sir. Take the lift to the third floor.
It's the first door on your right, sir.

1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:48.600
Thank you.

1:18:49.900 --> 1:18:52.400
- Sir?
- Don't you want to search me?

1:18:53.700 --> 1:18:57.000
Guests for the executive suites
are never searched, sir.

1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:00.800
Right. I knew that.

1:19:14.100 --> 1:19:16.200
Welcome! Come in, come in.

1:19:19.700 --> 1:19:21.800
Excellent.

1:19:21.900 --> 1:19:25.500
I'm nothing if not hospitable, Felix.
Make yourself at home.

1:19:25.700 --> 1:19:28.600
Iki: I'm so excited I could shit!

1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:32.700
(Crowd roars)

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:37.300
- Huh?
- Right, Mr. McElroy, a drink

1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:39.400
while tell you about my plans

1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:41.600
Oh I've got plans Mr. McEroy

1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:45.000
- Big fucking plans.
- Hey hey hey!

1:19:45.100 --> 1:19:47.200
No talk. You want a beverage?

1:19:48.300 --> 1:19:51.000
I'll fix your beverage
while you get the 20 mill.

1:19:52.100 --> 1:19:54.800
I give you the formula, you smile,

1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:56.200
we toast,

1:19:56.300 --> 1:19:58.300
we pretend we're friends,

1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:02.700
- and we go our separate ways.
- Foreplay Mr. McEroy

1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:06.000
- It's the only way to a good relationship.
- Ah

1:20:06.100 --> 1:20:09.500
Iki, my love, we're way past holding hands.

1:20:11.300 --> 1:20:12.700
(Whistle blows)

1:20:22.900 --> 1:20:25.400
20 million in bonds. Untraceable.

1:20:25.500 --> 1:20:29.700
What?! Is that supposed to be 20 mill?

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:33.900
I'm not heftin' gold bars around the shop,
am I? It's not fucking Goldfinger, is it?

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:35.400
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:37.500
Easy, flower.

1:20:37.700 --> 1:20:39.400
Where's my formula?

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.400
Wish you were here?

1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:00.100
(Laughs)

1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:02.200
(Continues laughing)

1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:08.200
I'm fucking there, Mr. McElroy.
I'm fucking there.

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.400
An inspired choice, I must say,

1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:13.400
my er... chemical brother.

1:21:14.100 --> 1:21:15.100
Cheers.

1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:19.600
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:28.300
I never was one to be too sentimental.

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000
Elmo!

1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:36.300
It ain't often

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:41.000
that a blowed-up motherfucker gets to chat
to the motherfucker that blowed him up.

1:21:41.100 --> 1:21:42.900
You got that right.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.800
Usually, the blowed-up motherfucker
has the courtesy to stay blowed up.

1:21:46.900 --> 1:21:49.700
I'll try to be more
accommodating next time, Elmo.

1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.500
Ooh, cocktails! What are we celebrating?

1:21:54.700 --> 1:21:57.400
Oh, er... we're toasting...

1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:00.600
..our deal, Mr. Lizard.

1:22:01.700 --> 1:22:03.200
- Our deal?
- Not your deal.

1:22:03.300 --> 1:22:05.400
Hands across the ocean you might say

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:07.300
Fucking twat.

1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:09.600
Elmo Mix-Master.

1:22:12.100 --> 1:22:14.600
Cheers.

1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:19.000
- I love your touches.
- To a global partnership.

1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:21.400
LIZARD: To a global partnership!

1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:27.200
Ow.

1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:30.500
Fucking limey bastard.

1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:33.800
Global partnership, my ass!

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.500
My money is on good old-fashioned
American monopoly, you son of a bitch!

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:40.500
Besides,

1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:43.300
England ain't nothin'...

1:22:43.500 --> 1:22:46.600
nothing' but the 51st. state!

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:53.000
Don't you just fucking hate it
when a motherfucker stabs you in the back?

1:22:55.800 --> 1:22:59.700
The Lizard travelled 12,000 miles
to settle accounts with you!

1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:01.400
So? What?

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:04.600
You gonna tell me how much you missed me,
or are you gonna shoot me?

1:23:04.700 --> 1:23:07.600
I'm sick and tired of
fucking chasing your ass!

1:23:07.700 --> 1:23:11.200
Now, you give me my fucking goods,
and you give 'em to me fucking now!

1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:15.200
You better chill with
that shit, motherfucker.

1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:17.300
- Own you!
- You own me?

1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:20.200
- I fucking own you!
- You own shit!

1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:24.300
Go ahead, kill me. Put me out of my misery
for the first time in 30 years.

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:27.000
But you will no longer take what is mine.

1:23:27.100 --> 1:23:28.600
Fucking right. 10% is mine.

1:23:28.700 --> 1:23:32.100
- Five!
- Five fucking per cent of that's mine.

1:23:32.300 --> 1:23:34.900
Shut the fuck up!
I don't even know who the fuck you are!

1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:40.400
Oh, you've got some big
fucking onions, Elmo.

1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:42.600
This...

1:23:42.700 --> 1:23:46.200
is the most expensive candy on the market.

1:23:46.300 --> 1:23:48.500
The drug's a fake, you know.

1:23:48.700 --> 1:23:52.800
It's bogus. It's what we
chemists call a placebo.

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.000
It's whatever you want it to be.

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:00.500
You can run all the tests you want, and it'll
look like the best shit in the universe,

1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:05.300
but the ingredients... they
cancel each other out.

1:24:05.500 --> 1:24:09.600
Fucking confusing The Lizard
ain't gonna fucking help your cause, Elmo.

1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:12.000
You've gotta give big ups to marketing.

1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:14.100
The ability to make people believe.

1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:16.200
The power of suggestion.

1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:18.900
P-O-S

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000
51.

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:25.000
I don't give a shit!
Is this fucking science lecture over?

1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:28.500
It will be in... 23 seconds.

1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:35.700
It takes 10 seconds for an imbibed liquid
to reach the stomach

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:41.100
It takes the human body 81 seconds to heat that
liquid to the point of chemical volatility.

1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:46.100
You... have 12 seconds left.

1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:48.700
12 seconds?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:50.700
And what is the big fucking umbrella?

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:52.100
Freeze!

1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:54.000
- Oh!
- You lumpy

1:24:54.100 --> 1:24:55.600
in the kaftan, drop the gun.

1:24:55.700 --> 1:24:58.900
Nice and controlled.
How's my timing, Felix?

1:24:59.100 --> 1:25:00.600
It's fucking perfect.

1:25:00.700 --> 1:25:02.700
Ow! Argh!

1:25:02.900 --> 1:25:05.200
(Gurgling)

1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:09.700
Aaaargh!

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.100
Aargh!

1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:12.700
(Cheering)

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:14.400
(Whistle)

1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:17.200
(Cheering)

1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:26.800
That cleared my sinuses.

1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:31.600
Drugs...

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:33.600
always kill you in the end.

1:25:45.900 --> 1:25:48.700
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa, shit!

1:25:48.900 --> 1:25:51.100
(Mutters)

1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:53.800
All right, lads.

1:25:53.900 --> 1:25:56.400
Get the cuffs on this cockney twat!

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000
As agreed.

1:26:03.900 --> 1:26:05.900
What about the drug?

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.600
You conned us.

1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:10.800
I conned them...

1:26:10.900 --> 1:26:13.200
We got paid.

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:16.300
Is this,

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:19.100
or is this not, worth 20 million dollars?

1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.100
This castle's worth,

1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:26.200
I'd say, more like...

1:26:26.300 --> 1:26:28.400
seven, seven and a half.

1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:40.200
(Whistle)

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:43.600

you are a genuine McElroy like myself,
you say.

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.700
This is the tartan of my slave master.

1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:26.000
I now claim his castle and
his lands for my own.

1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:28.100
I see.

1:27:28.300 --> 1:27:31.600
- But will you not now be making your putt?
- Aye

1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:45.600
Congratulations, Mr. McElroy.
An outstanding round of golf.

1:27:45.700 --> 1:27:47.700
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1:27:53.100 --> 1:27:55.100
