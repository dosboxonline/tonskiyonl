<i>- Copy that, Mr. Yüksel.</i>
- Okay.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.360
All right.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.120
You wait here. I'll be back.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.560
- Careful.
- They're here.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.880
What the…

00:49.040 --> 00:51.360
That motherfucker got the money!

00:51.440 --> 00:54.080
Son of a bitch! And he laughed in my face!

Where are you, Auntie Fatma?

03:29.560 --> 03:32.080
<i>"Hi, Sadık Adil Öcal."</i>

03:32.600 --> 03:35.760
<i>"We've evaluated the manuscript</i>
<i>you sent to our publishing house."</i>

03:36.280 --> 03:37.920
<i>"Your novel more resembles an essay</i>

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
<i>and fails to convey</i>
<i>any emotion or thrill to the reader."</i>

03:41.080 --> 03:44.840
<i>"The text also has trouble</i>
<i>keeping the reader's curiosity engaged."</i>

03:44.920 --> 03:48.360
<i>"We find that the story</i>
<i>suffers from frequent gaps</i>

03:48.440 --> 03:50.600
<i>in terms of events and mystery elements."</i>

03:50.680 --> 03:53.000
<i>"Also, we feel that the plot is weak."</i>

03:53.520 --> 03:56.080
<i>"Please remember</i>
<i>it is important to character development</i>

03:56.160 --> 03:58.600
<i>that they keep</i>

03:58.680 --> 04:00.080
<i>"Due to the above shortcomings,</i>

04:00.160 --> 04:04.520

04:10.840 --> 04:11.720
So…

04:12.240 --> 04:14.040
Auntie Fatma's not here to feed you?

04:15.040 --> 04:17.240
Maybe her name is Ayşe, not Fatma.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.320
How should I know?

04:18.400 --> 04:23.600
DAY 1

04:23.680 --> 04:26.480
Oh, you mean Şaziye. Come with me.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.000
- She lives across the street, at 16.
- There?

04:30.080 --> 04:30.920
Yes.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.120
Look at all this water.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.200
Last night was the third house fire
in the last six months.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.400
They declare these houses historical sites
and then no one can fix them up.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.920
At this rate,
Balat will burn to the ground.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.960
Thanks.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.520
Tell Şaziye that I ran out of pages.
She'll know what I mean.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.640
They're wooden. Easy to burn down.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.480
Don't talk all at once!

04:57.040 --> 04:59.920
You wanted this job.
No one thought you'd be any good at it,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.560
and you're proving them right!

05:01.640 --> 05:05.000
Brother, I'll file
a complaint as your mukhtar.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.680
They need to investigate.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.080
Right, that's what
I've been talking about all this time!

05:10.160 --> 05:11.160
That's not true!

05:11.240 --> 05:13.760
Get the police here, find out
who's setting these damn fires!

05:13.840 --> 05:16.480
He's a weasel, but nothing's
gonna happen if we all yell at him.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.120
You think I don't know that?

05:19.080 --> 05:20.520
You're just gonna have to be patient!

05:30.680 --> 05:31.680
Auntie Şaziye?

05:33.200 --> 05:36.600
How are you?
I got your address from Hayri the grocer.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.160
He's sending debt collectors now?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.760
Tell that bandit
I'll pay him when I have money.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.240
Oh, no, I'm not here for money.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.560
I live over by the fountain.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.240
I see you every morning feeding the cats.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.320
I haven't seen you for two days.
I wanted to check in.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.880
I was worried.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.840
Mutema didn't bring any new bags of food.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.280
She is the one to ask.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.600
Hey! Shoo! Get the fuck out of here!

06:05.680 --> 06:07.040
No food for you!

06:07.120 --> 06:09.800
You know how much a bag costs?
Who am I, King Croesus?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.200
So, this Mutema,

06:11.280 --> 06:14.120
why hasn't she brought,
you know, any more food?

06:14.200 --> 06:15.640
Does she have COVID or something?

06:16.800 --> 06:17.920
She was killed.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.320
What?

06:20.400 --> 06:23.160
Hey, shoo! Get out of here, you mutt!

06:26.720 --> 06:29.120
What makes you think something like that?

06:29.200 --> 06:33.000
She used to come here once a week,
play some music, then leave.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.160
- What day is it?
- It's Wednesday, April 1st.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.040
Good one, Şaziye.
That's an April Fool's joke, right?

06:40.120 --> 06:41.040
"She was killed."

06:41.120 --> 06:42.240
What joke?

06:43.600 --> 06:45.440
She last came a week ago Tuesday.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.640
One bag lasts only two weeks.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.880
The only way she'd let those cats starve
is if that girl was dead.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.800
Go, check it out if you like.
See if there is new food there.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.360
<i>Don't do it. Don't get curious.</i>

06:59.960 --> 07:02.440
<i>Don't interfere. Stay out of it. Don't.</i>

08:34.440 --> 08:36.240
- Who are you?
- Who are <i>you?</i>

08:36.320 --> 08:38.760
You are coughing like crazy.
Put on your mask!

08:38.840 --> 08:39.840
Ahmet.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.440
- Şaziye is my grandma.
- Oh.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.040
Well…

08:52.120 --> 08:55.680
I'm here for the cat food.
Şaziye told me to come get it.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.080
Ahmet? Your grandmother
told me that Mutema was killed.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.120
Grandma told me
to come and get her keys back.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.360
And her name is not Mutema. It's Mutena.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.000
Well, if she wasn't killed,
why does your grandma say so?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.480
Something happened? Did she see something?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.400
Grandma is senile.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.920
Leave the keys before you go.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.400
Okay.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.920
Right. It's time
for the traitor to confess her love.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.160
Here we go.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.560
Sadık, good morning.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.520
I've been counting
since I came to Istanbul,

09:48.600 --> 09:50.240
and this is my 442nd call.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.720
Why don't you get it?

09:51.800 --> 09:55.640
Part of me wanted to stay with you,
the other part wanted to run away.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.280
For the thousandth time, I love you.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.120
<i>But Eskişehir wasn't for me.</i>

10:00.640 --> 10:03.760
<i>Besides, I didn't leave you.</i>
<i>You just didn't want to come with me.</i>

10:03.840 --> 10:06.480
<i>Anyway, here's the news of the day.</i>

10:06.560 --> 10:09.560
<i>It's pretty hot in here.</i>
<i>And the pandemic is freaking scary.</i>

10:09.640 --> 10:13.120
<i>Have you read the news about</i>
<i>Buket and Gülhan in the papers?</i>

10:13.200 --> 10:15.320
<i>Someone's really obsessed with them.</i>

10:15.400 --> 10:16.800
<i>Well, that's all from me.</i>

10:16.880 --> 10:19.280
I'll send you some new photos soon.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.600
Mutena, are you really dead?

11:16.960 --> 11:17.960
Listen to me.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.040
You'd better get home before it's dark.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.320
The cats around here can eat you alive.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.040
Adil?

11:49.560 --> 11:52.320
I've missed you so much!

11:53.400 --> 11:55.960
Adil, aren't you excited to see me?
Come on, be happy!

11:56.040 --> 11:59.840
Did you get a doggie? So cute.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.960
Don't stand there, bring those inside.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.960
Your grandma left you
nothing but this old house?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.880
How can you live here?

12:09.480 --> 12:12.320
You need to answer me first.
What are doing here?

12:13.240 --> 12:15.160
I got a job offer for a TV show.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.600
In fact, I'm getting
a co-producer credit on the first episode.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.160
- What?
- Do you have any booze?

12:20.960 --> 12:23.200
Where did you get production money?

12:23.280 --> 12:25.600
I sold my share at the hotel
to Cousin Remzi.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.680
You don't own any share!
It's all Zeynel's and Hüso's.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.280
And that man is not your cousin.
He's an opportunist!

12:31.360 --> 12:34.680
Does that even matter?
Rıza's cousin or mine, same thing.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.640
Sweetheart, are you still mad at me?

12:38.720 --> 12:42.120
The man you thought was your husband
is the man you divorced 20 years ago.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.360
How was I supposed to know?

12:44.440 --> 12:47.160
I thought I remarried Rıza.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.800
For God's sake, tell me, Adil,

12:49.880 --> 12:54.040
how could a man haunt the dreams
of the woman he divorced,

12:54.120 --> 12:56.360
every night for ten years? That's insane!

12:56.440 --> 12:57.400
Listen, Meral,

12:57.480 --> 13:00.040
there's only one bed in this house.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.600
This is not a place for a woman like you.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.240
But there are rules. Rules.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.040
Let me ask you this.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.080
Did you tell Pınar I'm here?

13:12.240 --> 13:14.520
No. But you know what?

13:14.600 --> 13:19.000
If she finds out you've been in Istanbul
for four months, she'll kill us both.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.080
Okay. Fine. But if you're staying here…

13:22.160 --> 13:24.560
One, no drinking.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.640
Two, you won't call Pınar
and tell her I'm here.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.200
Yes, my commander.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.640
But don't be mad at Pınar.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.640
She hasn't touched a man
in eight months. I swear.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.920
She's madly in love with you.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.480
That's why she ran away
the first chance she got.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.760
"A woman who grew up
on a street with no name in Balat

13:49.840 --> 13:53.600
brings bags of food
for the stray cats and dogs

13:53.680 --> 13:56.680
and pays an old woman to feed them."

13:56.760 --> 14:00.760
"This woman of 25
has been missing for 16 days."

14:00.840 --> 14:02.400
"Some fear she was murdered."

14:02.920 --> 14:06.400
"She has an unusual name, Mutena."

14:06.480 --> 14:07.560
Give me that.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.160
This is so exciting. I love mysteries.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.560
- Are you writing a TV show?
- A mystery story.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.840
Very good.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.760
Meral, let me ask you something.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.080
Am I a nosy person?

14:23.160 --> 14:25.280
I think the better word for you is

14:25.360 --> 14:26.520
a wacko.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.240
Anyway, bring the bags up here.

14:29.320 --> 14:33.280
It stinks in here.
Is it mildew or what? It beats me.

14:35.960 --> 14:36.800
Come on!

14:36.880 --> 14:37.800
DAY 2

14:37.880 --> 14:39.000
You won't do it?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
Listen to me.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.360
If you think you are too posh
to do it just anywhere,

14:46.440 --> 14:47.840
you're in for constipation.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.000
Fine, suit yourself. We're going home.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.320
Come.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.120
Are you here?

15:17.000 --> 15:17.840
Right.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.680
The mystery ends here.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.240
Well, Ms. Editor, there goes
the element of intrigue and buildup

15:50.840 --> 15:52.880
before we get to the first plot twist.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.520
But I tried. What more I can do?

15:57.160 --> 15:58.760
The clinic is closed.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.200
The government shut it because of COVID.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.760
No massage for you.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.200
I was looking for a person who works here.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.000
Her name is Güzin.
Or should I call her Mutena?

16:10.960 --> 16:13.920
- Who's looking for her?
- Let's say it's someone curious.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.480
Well, curiosity comes at a price.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.840
Oh.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.760
She hasn't come to work for 15 days.

16:26.840 --> 16:30.560
But for 500,
I can tell you how to find Mete.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.400
- Her car-salesman boyfriend.
- For 500?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.440
No, he wasn't a salesman.
They called him "Metelik."

16:41.520 --> 16:44.520
He mostly ran errands.
But he got sacked two weeks ago.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.920
I think he stole a car for a joyride.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.880
Oh no. How am I going to find the guy now?

16:49.960 --> 16:52.800
Heard he's selling water
at the traffic lights in Karaköy.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.920
- Really?
- Why do you ask?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.440
- He owes you money too?
- No.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.720
<i>Mine is a literary issue. Thanks.</i>

17:11.640 --> 17:14.080
Water! Water, anyone? Water!

17:18.720 --> 17:19.560
Sir, water?

17:34.440 --> 17:37.800
- Business looks slow.
- This fucking pandemic.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.680
I put this on, still no buyers.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.680
Thanks, brother.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.160
You need something, bro?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.400
Yeah, some information about Mutena.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.600
We've been worried.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.320
- By "we," you mean you and…
- My grandma.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.320
Mutena is our upstairs neighbor in Balat.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.920
She'd drop off cat food
every now and then.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
My grandma is into this stuff.
She feeds the animals with the food.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.640
Mutena hasn't been around lately.
Grandma is worried.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.000
She asked me to check around,
make sure nothing's happened.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.280
We are worried.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.080
I went to the clinic where she worked,

18:16.160 --> 18:18.040
someone there sent me
to the car dealership,

18:18.120 --> 18:19.200
and they sent me here.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.240
I haven't seen her for two weeks either.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.040
Anyway, back to work.
Got lots of water to sell.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.960
Wait, I'm thirsty too.
I can drink the whole box.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.840
- It's a 12-bottle box.
- Okay, how much?

18:37.360 --> 18:38.520
One fifty, they're yours.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.400
Take this.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.560
- Shall I go get the change?
- No, you can keep it.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.520
- Are you hungry, bro?
- Sure.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.600
Come with me.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.800
- Wait, let me help.
- Thanks.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.440
- You don't know Muti, do you?
- No.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.680
I call her "Muti."

19:11.320 --> 19:14.080
Listen, if you
intend to do any harm to her…

19:14.160 --> 19:15.920
- Not at all.
- Good.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.840
Anyone who intends to harm her
has to go through me first.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.280
Tell me this,
is Muti in the massage business?

19:24.360 --> 19:26.360
- No, why?
- It's what I heard.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.120
- Do you use social media, bro?
- No.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.360
Here, look.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.320
Muti rocking the social media.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.520
Her alias is "Burn This World."

20:15.560 --> 20:18.040
<i>Don't be fooled by her cheerful videos.</i>

20:18.120 --> 20:20.600
She's a little wacko just like you and me.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.280
You know the story,
drunk dad and crazy mom.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.560
One day, she and I
will move to Kaş together.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.480
We haven't been further than Pendik yet,
but that's still the dream.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.680
So, it's been two weeks
since you last saw her?

20:33.760 --> 20:35.920
Yeah, it's been 15 days or so.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.400
Since the day she went
to that job interview.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.200
I was an agency
called Okaliptus in Ataşehir.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.520
She was excited about that job.

20:45.040 --> 20:48.520
Said she'd get Burn This World
to another platform, be famous,

20:48.600 --> 20:50.800
and buy a cool sports car.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.920
I guess the offer wasn't that good.

20:54.440 --> 20:55.920
She was upset about that.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.080
Then she stopped answering her phone.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.680
I called her a few times.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.600
She told me
she'd been staying at the studio,

21:03.680 --> 21:06.160
but it turns out
she was there in your neighborhood.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.920
I see. All right.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.160
Why didn't you go to the police
and file a missing person report?

21:11.240 --> 21:14.360
Are you nuts?
Do the cops care about people like us?

21:14.440 --> 21:18.160
If I show them her videos,
they'll arrest her for prostitution.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.360
You're right.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.360
- Has she ever had a stalker?
- No.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.480
- I've gotta get back to work, bro.
- Sure.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.560
Send me a photo of Muti!

21:28.640 --> 21:30.760
- You got my number, right?
- I did.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.040
All right.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.400
Note to the editor,
the mystery is not over yet.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.360
Deniz Gökyaylı, I don't know
how the plot can be improved,

21:41.440 --> 21:44.200
but A, Metelik is a character,
not a stereotype, and B,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.400
we are at our first plot twist.

21:52.800 --> 21:56.320
<i>Adil? A woman came by</i>
<i>and asked for the doggy,</i>

21:56.400 --> 21:59.160
<i>said the dog was hers and took it away.</i>

21:59.240 --> 22:01.000
But a few minutes later,

22:01.080 --> 22:04.760
I found your mutt wandering
like a lost child around the fountain.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.800
So I brought it back home.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.280
Stupid woman!
She left the poor dog behind.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.320
You'd better bring a leash home.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.760
And get a light bulb.

22:14.840 --> 22:18.560
And a new mask for me.
That mutt tore mine while playing.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.200
I'm so screwed!

22:25.360 --> 22:28.560
Yes. Her alias is Burn This World.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.800
Yes.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.200
Fifteen days ago.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.240
Her agent, Mr. Öcal, is with me here.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.280
I got it, okay. I'll let him know.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.440
Thank you.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.160
Mr. Şinasi says
he didn't conduct such an interview.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.680
It doesn't show in his appointment logs.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.600
Okay. Thanks. Have a nice day.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.680
You too.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.160
- Where've you been all day?
- What's this? Give me that.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.640
- I found it under the pillow.
- Give me that. Jeez.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.600
I had that poor guy
in the palm of my hand.

23:33.280 --> 23:36.920
I talked him into five masks
at ten liras apiece.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.440
Luckily, Şermin came,
and she took me to the supermarket.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.400
- Who's Şermin?
- The owner of the mutt.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.720
Your socialite of a dog
turns out to be named Çiko.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.400
I don't think it suits her, but whatever…

23:51.480 --> 23:53.200
You took a stranger into my home.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.200
Had drinks with her, right?

23:56.320 --> 23:57.720
Violation of the first rule.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.200
Did you violate the second?
Did you call Pınar?

24:02.760 --> 24:04.160
- Meral, no.
- She called me.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.440
Did you give her the address? Did you?

24:08.480 --> 24:10.680
The door. Şermin is here to get Çiko.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.400
Wait! It's Pınar. I know, Pınar is here.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.480
You, motherfucker! I'm gonna fuck you up.

24:21.280 --> 24:24.040
DAY 3

24:25.760 --> 24:27.480
Adil, my dear, are you awake?

24:29.160 --> 24:31.800
What the hell happened to me? Where am I?

24:32.600 --> 24:35.600
In the hospital. Don't you remember, dear?

24:36.680 --> 24:40.280
They beat you up, son.
Pretty badly, too, I might add.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.800
The shorter one was Şermin's husband.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.560
Why didn't they beat you up?

24:44.640 --> 24:46.800
Because she's not the one fucking Şermin.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.280
You are, Mr. Sadık Adil.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.640
And then there's this girl
in these videos. Mutena.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.880
You are fast!

24:51.960 --> 24:53.920
Good job, two girls in four months.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.560
Couldn't help calling her, right?

24:58.360 --> 25:00.480
Adil, those men had you on the ground,

25:00.560 --> 25:02.000
they were stomping on you,

25:02.080 --> 25:04.600
and our girl swooped in
like a bolt of lightning.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.160
I'll fuck you up!

25:06.720 --> 25:09.320
You lunatic! Let him go!

25:11.160 --> 25:12.160
Stop it!

25:17.440 --> 25:20.840
I don't know when
she saw the gun and picked it up.

25:20.920 --> 25:24.240
And then Pınar had
the presence of mind to call Gülhan.

25:24.760 --> 25:25.960
And we brought you here.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.960
Those guys did a pretty good job.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.840
A lot of damage to the face,
but the body is intact.

25:38.600 --> 25:43.120
When the niece called,
my buddy and I rushed here from Eskişehir.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.720
It took three hours and 50 minutes.
Although, if we had taken the train…

25:47.880 --> 25:50.840
But first, let us deal with
this beating incident.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.960
Hüso. There's nothing to deal with.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.200
It's a misunderstanding.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.760
They must’ve mistaken me
with someone else. Leave!

25:56.840 --> 26:00.480
Well, sir, the niece had told us

26:00.560 --> 26:02.440
we could stay at your place.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.600
What do we do?

26:06.680 --> 26:07.600
Is that a wig?

26:09.560 --> 26:11.280
No. It's my own hair.

26:12.520 --> 26:15.080
Transplant… I mean, transplanted from me.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.160
He had it done
with his share of the money.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.520
He looks younger.
You'll get used to it in a few days.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.920
I won't be seeing any of you that long.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.320
There's only one bed in the house.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.600
You can't go back there,
Casanova of Balat.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.400
I'd leave you on the street,
but the doctor said you need care.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.400
You and Meral will stay at my place.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.680
Come on, everybody out!

26:36.760 --> 26:39.880
Doctors will arrive soon to decide
if this playboy can be discharged.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.440
Brother, get well soon.

26:46.640 --> 26:50.040
Gülhan asked for you
to drop by before you leave.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.840
Are you in charge here?
Giving orders left and right.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.760
I work in PR at Köseoğlu Group.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.640
I'm studying for
the college entrance exam.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.080
Good for you.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.800
Sadık, aren't you happy for me?

27:05.880 --> 27:08.680
Wasn't it you who said,
"Think. Improve yourself."

27:08.760 --> 27:10.840
"Seek nothing from others."

27:10.920 --> 27:13.560
I wouldn't have graduated high school
if I stayed in Eskişehir.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.440
Because you were there.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.120
Hey, say something!

27:20.760 --> 27:21.880
Where is Gülhan?

27:23.920 --> 27:26.520
Hope you are well.
They told me you're fine.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.840
They initially thought
it could be a concussion.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.320
Oh, no.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.400
I have a thick skull.
I'm just a little sore.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.400
- But no painkillers this time.
- Nope.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.400
Lately, I can't commit to anything.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.400
Including drugs. See this?

27:45.160 --> 27:46.320
How's Buket?

27:47.520 --> 27:48.640
She abandoned us.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.520
Me and our daughter.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.920
Her sick sister. All of us.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.360
Filiz?

27:59.320 --> 28:00.440
Is she sick?

28:01.240 --> 28:02.160
Is it bad?

28:03.760 --> 28:04.840
Oh God.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.840
So Buket was overwhelmed
by all those stories in the papers, right?

28:11.800 --> 28:13.320
I think we were both exhausted.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.160
She just realized it before I did.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.600
Hey, Chief.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.400
<i>Cops came to the house</i>
<i>about the disturbance last night.</i>

28:24.480 --> 28:27.400
<i>There's a complaint against you.</i>
<i>They're looking for you.</i>

28:27.480 --> 28:32.640
If you ask me, don't go
to the police with that face, though.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.800
You see, Sadık Adil,
you can't go back to Balat.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.480
The cuckolded husband
and the police are after you.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.640
How long does this meat
need to stay like this?

28:48.720 --> 28:50.400
Meral said two hours.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.240
It will be cooked by then.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.280
People can't afford to eat it,
we put it on our eyes. Luxury.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.840
Look at you, a good job, a nice apartment.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.240
Why do you still want me?

29:09.040 --> 29:11.640
Don't you get it? I love you!

29:13.560 --> 29:15.000
You don't leave people you love.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.560
In love, your happiness
relies on the other person.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.560
So your unhappiness is multiplied by two.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.680
Such a smooth talker.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.360
I loved you more when you were a good man.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.160
- I hate it when you're a bad man!
- I'm a curious man now.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.480
But keep thinking I'm a bad man.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.160
- I need something from you.
- What?

29:35.240 --> 29:38.080
There's a media company
called Okaliptus Agency.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.000
Make an appointment with them.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.960
- Why?
- Why do you think?

29:42.040 --> 29:45.680
To rectify the public opinion
about KS Group and Ms. Gülhan.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.560
There are literary reasons too.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.040
I need to improve the plot.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.840
Look at this view!

29:55.400 --> 29:58.040
An elite neighborhood, a beautiful house…

29:58.680 --> 30:03.600
KS Group is amazing.
I wonder if they sponsor TV shows too.

30:04.520 --> 30:05.760
Don't get used to this.

30:13.080 --> 30:16.960
Zeynel, go to the police in the morning.
Find out what this complaint is about.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.960
Hüso, come back here tomorrow
and keep an eye on Meral.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.920
She's found another conman
and will lose the rest of her money.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.160
And don't get too attached to Pinar.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.040
We're leaving town
as soon as we're done here.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.320
- Huh?
- It's me. Don't be afraid.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.960
Meral keeps screaming.

30:44.040 --> 30:47.120
Her ghost is back again.
And she's snoring.

30:47.640 --> 30:51.240
She keeps going to the bathroom.
She has an upset tummy.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.120
Get your arm off me.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.640
You always pull the same trick.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.280
I'll just leave.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.000
Okay, tell me something.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.320
Why are we going to Okaliptus tomorrow?

31:05.400 --> 31:06.800
Is it about Mutena?

31:07.440 --> 31:09.920
Yes, and if that's all, move your leg off.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.200
We'd better put some concealer on those.

31:15.680 --> 31:16.960
Does it hurt?

31:20.840 --> 31:24.200
Sadık, shall we make up?

31:26.720 --> 31:28.080
Okay, I'm leaving.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.560
All right. I'll just go to sleep.

31:42.960 --> 31:43.800
DAY 4

31:43.880 --> 31:46.960
In two hours, we'll send you notes
for the promotional campaign

31:47.040 --> 31:49.720
for the Köseoğlu Group and Ms. Gülhan.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.120
- Amazing. Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.920
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.360
The exit is this way.

32:02.840 --> 32:07.920
Pınar, we were supposed to see Mr. Şinasi,
but it must have slipped our minds.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.080
Is he in?

32:09.160 --> 32:13.320
Mr. Şinasi is in the real estate,
I mean, land development department.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.440
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.640
I'm Öcal Kara, overseeing
the Köseoğlu Group's new hospital project.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.440
We thought we'd see him
while we were here.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.520
You know, the pandemic. Less contact.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.120
Where is his office?

32:26.200 --> 32:28.040
- On the left. You may go in.
- Thanks.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.720
OKALİPTUS AGENCY
WE MAKE PROGRESS

32:39.120 --> 32:40.920
Yes? Who are you looking for?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.080
For the first turning point.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.800
Whoa. Don't you dare to touch that.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.720
What do you think is in my right pocket?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.080
Sit back down.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.320
There's an Internet influencer
called Burn This World.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.600
We're assistants to her agents,
handling debt collection.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.480
Oh, this?

33:02.560 --> 33:05.600
Some meetings get difficult,
like yesterday's.

33:05.680 --> 33:09.080
Today those guys are in the ICU,
fighting for their lives.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.680
Yeah, okay.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.600
Okay, stand by.

33:15.560 --> 33:19.560
She took 10,000 dollars from you
and disappeared paying us our cut.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.120
Here's my theory. One,
the girl comes to you and does her dance,

33:23.200 --> 33:25.440
you refuse to pay her
after the performance

33:25.520 --> 33:26.600
and then you…

33:26.680 --> 33:28.320
- What?
- Sit down!

33:32.000 --> 33:35.400
Two, you two split the money.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.640
Either way, we're after our due, okay?

33:38.720 --> 33:41.760
If this meeting doesn't go well,
we'll take this to Ms. Neşe.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.080
Ms. Neşe? No!
There's a big mix-up here. Listen…

33:45.160 --> 33:48.000
We were just acting as the middleman
for a reputable client.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.880
We met that Burn woman only once, I swear.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.240
Look, there was no money exchanged.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.640
You were the middleman
for what reputable <i>client?</i>

33:56.720 --> 33:58.080
That's English, right?

33:58.640 --> 33:59.560
Who are they?

34:02.760 --> 34:04.000
Mr. Kutsi.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.680
Kutsi Atak.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.960
One of our biggest clients.
General Secretary of Zincirli Holdings.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.840
The way you talked was unbelievable!

34:19.920 --> 34:22.560
He was scared to death. Even I was scared.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.440
Which stage are we at in the plot?

34:24.960 --> 34:26.720
We're past the first plot twist.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.960
We're close to
the first inciting incident.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.160
- Does this story ever get a bit erotic?
- What?

34:36.760 --> 34:38.560
You are all crazy.

34:39.200 --> 34:43.800
- You, Meral, Hüso.
- Madness is better than treachery.

34:46.640 --> 34:50.080
I wish I had let those men
tear out your tongue and feed it to you.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.280
You don't say.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.800
Got it, yeah. Okay, see you then.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.200
Zeynel went to the police.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.760
The guy that beat me up, Şermin's husband,

35:04.320 --> 35:06.960
turns out he didn't report me,
it was someone anonymous.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.760
And Şermin's husband is a realtor.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.120
Zeynel told me to talk to the cops.
Maybe it'll help.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.840
Chief, I'm starving.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.320
When will we eat though?

35:17.400 --> 35:20.760
Who was he? Kutsi Atak?
You were to check him. So?

35:20.840 --> 35:23.960
Remember the company
that built skyscrapers in the forest

35:24.040 --> 35:26.320
and sold all of them to the Arabs?

35:26.400 --> 35:29.160
He is a boss there. I searched him.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.560
Doesn't seem the type
to hang out with a belly dancer.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.800
He's a family man.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.360
He shares family photos
all over his social media accounts.

35:36.880 --> 35:37.760
He's a philatelist.

35:37.840 --> 35:41.040
Don't dare ask me who "Phil" is, though!

35:41.120 --> 35:43.800
The guy is a stamp collector.
An expert. He has a blog.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.800
In short, Kutsi only has eyes
for his stamps and his family.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.080
And I only have sore eyes. Give me that.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.280
Okay. Find out which stamps
are the most coveted in Türkiye.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.000
Here.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Just take it.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.840
I told them it was okay,
and I wouldn't press charges.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.760
I don't know what else to say.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.360
You know what the captain says?

36:11.880 --> 36:15.040
"I don't want any trouble
with prominent businessmen."

36:16.080 --> 36:19.400
Since when are realtors called
"businessmen"? I don't get it.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.120
- Did you find anything?
- I wrote to his blog.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.120
I said, "I have two stamps
with Ottoman seals."

36:27.200 --> 36:30.040
- "How much are they worth?"
- Yeah, good.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.280
Let's go.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.640
They're not here. At least we tried.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.720
SITKI REAL ESTATE

36:45.800 --> 36:49.120
If you're considering a house or a plot,
both are good investments.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.520
This neighborhood'll
be crawling with tourists soon.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.480
Isn't there a construction ban?

36:54.280 --> 36:59.040
If you say, "I'll build the exact replica
of the burned properties," all is good.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.280
Ah.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.280
We are just looking for Mr. Sıtkı.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.120
Abdullah Ketenci.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.920
I am the mukhtar here.
It's our duty to tell the truth.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.600
Sitki is not the most trustworthy realtor.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.320
They just called him
a respected businessman in the station.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.160
No, sir. Sıtkı and his nephews
make a scene every day.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.680
He's unstable.
Always disturbing the peace.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.480
All because of that hot wife of his.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.520
Drove him mad with jealousy.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.240
Anyway, sir, I can
help you with your investment.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.840
I can show you a few places.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.640
If you can't reach me,
call the number on the back.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.720
- Have a good day.
- You too.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.680
I got word from Gülhan
that Buket's sister passed away.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.640
I texted our condolences.

37:48.920 --> 37:49.920
Filiz.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.960
All right, Mr. Kutsi. See you then.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.040
That was Kutsi.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.480
He wants to see my stamps
before I sell them online.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.000
Says he can help with pricing.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.760
Inviting me to the office.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.120
Everyone takes the bait
if it's what they love.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.640
Not in his office, though We need privacy.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.760
Tell me, Chief, why are we
messing with this Phil guy anyway?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.600
It's literary purposes, buddy.

38:21.680 --> 38:24.280
It's going to help develop the plot.

38:30.280 --> 38:33.080
I'm here at the place
we agreed upon. Okay.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.120
Hi.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.040
- What are you doing, man?
- Shush!

38:52.120 --> 38:53.160
Drive.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.600
- Move it.
- Okay.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.680
- Move it!
- Okay.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.720
I swear I only saw her once.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.480
Once! And that was in
the room to give her money.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.640
I have nothing to do with the dancing.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.640
- Who did she dance for, man?
- Hey!

39:06.960 --> 39:09.120
- Mr. Öner.
- Who is Mr. Öner?

39:09.640 --> 39:13.160
The manager, the zoning manager.
He asked specifically for your dancer.

39:14.280 --> 39:17.600
From Mr. Yüksel. Yüksel Zincirli.
He's our CEO. He sent her.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.320
Öner requested your dancer from him.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.240
So this Mr. Öner has big balls

39:22.320 --> 39:25.760
if he's asking the CEO
of a big company to pimp for him.

39:26.400 --> 39:30.400
There was a Mega Towers project.
You may have heard about it.

39:30.480 --> 39:35.040
There are setbacks in implementation.
Solving it depends on Öner's approval.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.760
If the towers are mega,
the money must be mega too.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.240
Can't be just 5,000 dollars.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.120
- Plus 500,000 dollars.
- What?

39:44.440 --> 39:47.200
Boss, look what I found in the back.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.040
Well done.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.640
Now, my security chiefs
will take your statement.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.320
They'll record it.
You'll tell them everything.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.760
Understood?

39:56.360 --> 39:58.040
Here's Kutsi's computer.

40:00.600 --> 40:04.360
Transfer his confessions on the phone
to the computer as well.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.960
He told us everything.
He spilled all the company's dirty deeds.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.000
Ms. Gülhan texted.

40:12.720 --> 40:16.960
"I'm so sad. Luckily, I have Bugül.
I console myself with her. Thanks. Gül."

40:17.640 --> 40:19.880
I texted her, but she replied to you.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.360
Who is Bugül anyway?
Sounds like a nickname.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.480
I don't know. Stop questioning everything.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.960
I'm the curious man here.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.240
Sadık, are you going to keep being rude?

40:31.840 --> 40:34.280
Maybe we shouldn't talk for a while.
Actually, yeah!

40:34.360 --> 40:36.120
From now on, we're not talking.

40:44.720 --> 40:45.720
Adil!

40:45.800 --> 40:46.880
Listen to this.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.360
<i>Thinking of you is beautiful</i>
<i>It is hopeful</i>

40:50.440 --> 40:53.920
<i>Thinking of you is like listening</i>
<i>To the most beautiful song</i>

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
<i>From the most beautiful voice in the world</i>
<i>And…</i>

40:58.480 --> 41:00.200
My memory is betraying me!

41:00.280 --> 41:02.360
I can't memorize more than four lines.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.400
What am I going to do now?
Adil, please, you have to help me, dear.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.600
Oh!

41:10.000 --> 41:11.440
I forgot to tell you!

41:11.520 --> 41:14.360
I read an article on the Internet today.

41:14.440 --> 41:17.600
The new symptoms of COVID
now include memory loss.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.840
You have diarrhea too?

41:20.120 --> 41:24.080
- What will happen now?
- Now, we'll quarantine you for 14 days.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.840
- 14 days?
- Yeah, 14 days.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.040
You'll go to your room.
For 14 days, we'll cut off all contact.

41:30.120 --> 41:35.120
What if I have to use the bathroom
while you're at home?

41:35.200 --> 41:36.520
Right, well…

41:37.080 --> 41:38.120
How about this?

41:38.200 --> 41:41.520
When you feel the need,
you just holler "Yoo-hoo," okay?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.080
- Yoo-hoo?
- We'll go to our rooms.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.080
When you're done,

41:45.600 --> 41:48.520
just say yoo-hoo again,
we'll go back to living our normal lives.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.160
- Yoo-hoo.
- Yes, don't forget that. Yoo-hoo.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.240
Thanks, Adil.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.680
- Don't forget. Yoo-hoo.
- Yoo-hoo.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.960
I thought we weren't talking.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.560
But you're dressed
to talk about something.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.680
Poetry is my weakness.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.520
It makes my anger fade away.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.440
Even if you’re bad, or curious, or rude…

42:31.120 --> 42:32.920
I still love you.

42:34.240 --> 42:38.240
If you hadn't come, I would've gone
back to Eskişehir after the exams.

43:09.680 --> 43:10.880
Doesn't mean we made up.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.320
<i>Bro, we were asleep,</i>
<i>and at dawn we heard a "Woof, woof."</i>

43:30.400 --> 43:33.920
We opened the door and there it was
with a pack of mutts behind it.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.120
We felt sorry for it and took it in.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.880
But that's not the reason…

43:38.960 --> 43:39.840
DAY 5

43:39.920 --> 43:41.720
…we bothered you this early.

43:41.800 --> 43:45.080
- Then why did you bother us?
- Hüso heard some news at the grocer's.

43:45.760 --> 43:48.560
Sıtkı, the realtor guy…

43:49.680 --> 43:51.560
- He's been killed.
- What?

43:55.360 --> 43:56.760
What are we going to do now?

43:57.440 --> 44:00.360
I confessed to the police
I had a grudge against him.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.760
Now the guy is dead.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.080
There's more bad news.

44:03.960 --> 44:04.920
What is it?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.880
Sıtkı was not alone.

44:08.880 --> 44:12.200
His wife was with him. She was killed too.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.840
- What? Şermin's dead too?
- I'm afraid so.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.760
- And one more thing.
- Now what?

44:17.840 --> 44:20.760
The cops are looking for you.
You're the prime suspect.

44:21.600 --> 44:24.400
And they…

44:25.080 --> 44:26.280
have photos.

44:26.840 --> 44:28.000
Hüso, just tell him!

44:29.000 --> 44:33.760
Şermin and the Chief… Photos… Your home…

44:33.840 --> 44:37.840
- What photos? Speak!
- Of Şermin, in your bedroom…

44:38.800 --> 44:40.200
Excuse me, Pinar.

44:40.280 --> 44:43.120
- Totally naked--
- What the hell?

44:43.200 --> 44:44.920
Sir, Sıtkı was a shady man.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.880
Remember those house fires?
He had something to do with them.

44:47.960 --> 44:51.680
He also has nephews.
And his nephews are after you.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.200
So that's the summary.

44:53.960 --> 44:57.120
What's he saying?
Why was Şermin naked in your place?

44:57.200 --> 44:59.760
I don't know. Photo… My house…

45:00.280 --> 45:01.400
How's that possible?

45:04.920 --> 45:06.080
Yoo-hoo, Meral!

45:07.160 --> 45:09.960
Şermin came to visit you
at the house in Balat, right?

45:11.080 --> 45:13.040
You sat and had drinks with her.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.160
Uh-huh.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.080
How much did you drink?

45:21.320 --> 45:22.280
I don't know…

45:23.440 --> 45:26.240
Don't remember. I think I fell asleep.

45:27.640 --> 45:28.800
She fell asleep.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.800
- Here's what happened.
- Yes.

45:30.880 --> 45:35.160
This Şermin and someone,
let's call him Mr. X for now,

45:36.200 --> 45:38.160
they decide to kill Sıtkı, okay?

45:38.240 --> 45:42.080
This Şermin and Mr. X
are probably lovers or partners.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.840
While I'm out, they knock on Meral's door.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.040
<i>Meral lets Şermin in.</i>

45:47.120 --> 45:50.200
<i>They have a friendly chat, have drinks.</i>

45:50.280 --> 45:52.960
<i>Once Meral dozes off,</i>
<i>Şermin sneaks Mr. X in.</i>

45:53.040 --> 45:54.960
They take some photos in the bedroom.

45:55.040 --> 45:59.280
Mr. X, the photographer, is the killer.
I don't know why he killed Şermin.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.560
Şermin is dead?

46:02.160 --> 46:06.880
Chief, how are we going
to find this Mr. X though?

46:14.440 --> 46:16.000
Thank you for coming.

46:18.200 --> 46:21.040
We buried her yesterday.
Only four people showed up.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.440
Due to the pandemic.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.080
She was diagnosed after Buket went abroad.

46:30.160 --> 46:32.080
Breast, uterus, even the lungs.

46:33.760 --> 46:37.520
Maybe we could've fought those,
but the pancreas…

46:40.400 --> 46:42.040
Buket doesn't know?

46:44.560 --> 46:47.000
She knows. But couldn't come.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.200
Where is she?

46:50.120 --> 46:52.720
In the US, I guess. We sometimes text.

46:52.800 --> 46:56.040
No. I've quit… being cold,
counting, alcohol, drugs and all that.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.080
I've been needing it lately.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.560
Bugül only belongs to me now.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.160
- Shall I call Buket--
- No.

47:08.360 --> 47:10.320
Nothing's changed.
I can manage without her.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.080
You'll have to adopt Bugül.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.240
Does she have any family besides Buket?

47:15.320 --> 47:17.120
- How's it going to work?
- I don't know.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.360
But we'll manage somehow.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.320
I told the lawyers, "Solve it or resign."

47:25.200 --> 47:26.200
Well…

47:27.000 --> 47:28.760
I'd better run, got things to do.

47:28.840 --> 47:31.040
Call me anytime.
And again, my condolences.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.040
Thank you.

47:37.880 --> 47:41.640
Admit it. Şermin was
better than you at building fiction.

47:41.720 --> 47:43.760
No, her plot is weak.

47:44.880 --> 47:46.840
See, she failed to end her story.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.120
As Hüso says, how are we
going to find Mr. X, Chief?

47:51.720 --> 47:54.480
- She's getting away.
- No, she'll be fine.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.080
Come here. Come.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.840
See, she's here.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.920
She always finds her owner. Good girl!

48:07.480 --> 48:08.600
I wonder,

48:08.680 --> 48:11.400
if we go back to the neighborhood
and release her there

48:12.200 --> 48:13.480
she'll find her home?

48:13.560 --> 48:14.680
Sure, she will.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.960
- What just happened?
- Hurry up.

48:26.040 --> 48:26.920
What? Come.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.480
The second plot twist
in the second mystery is near.

48:29.560 --> 48:33.160
Şermin is no match for me.
I found a way to catch Mr. X.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.640
- Hey, move.
- Look at us.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.280
Not here either? Look left and right.

48:38.360 --> 48:40.240
Look here, Çiko!

48:41.960 --> 48:43.560
- Shoo!
- Move it.

48:45.280 --> 48:47.240
DAY 6

48:47.320 --> 48:49.520
- Move it.
- Move!

48:50.720 --> 48:51.560
Move!

48:52.040 --> 48:53.240
<i>Yes, Zeynel?</i>

48:53.320 --> 48:55.720
We brought the mutt to the intersection.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.400
It's just standing there.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.480
Then it's not that street.

48:59.560 --> 49:03.120
Okay, you keep doing what you're doing
on all the other intersections.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.600
<i>- Okay, bro.</i>
- Bye.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.880
You think Çiko can find X?

49:09.160 --> 49:10.760
If the plot is built right, yes.

49:11.720 --> 49:12.960
CALLING
ÖNER

49:13.040 --> 49:14.080
Watch and learn.

49:16.760 --> 49:18.760
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Good day, Öner.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.360
You can hang up
or even call other people for all I care,

49:23.440 --> 49:24.800
but it's no use.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.720
You see the account information I sent?

49:28.360 --> 49:29.280
Right.

49:29.360 --> 49:33.280
We don't want to do you
any harm here, nor your company.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.240
We're waiting for you
outside your building now.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.160
If you don't come down,
or there's any reason we can't meet,

49:39.240 --> 49:42.000
we'll give all that information
to the press. Understand?

49:42.080 --> 49:44.400
You'll read all about it in the papers.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.440
Yes.

49:51.960 --> 49:54.560
<i>I'm coming down. How will I know you?</i>

49:54.640 --> 49:55.720
Just come down.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.160
You'll see a very pretty young woman

49:58.240 --> 49:59.560
in front of the building.

50:00.360 --> 50:03.320
You'll know it's her.
She'll bring you to me.

50:06.200 --> 50:07.200
Be careful.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.000
Where are we going?

50:33.240 --> 50:34.520
Hi, Öner.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.080
Now, take off your jacket,

50:37.160 --> 50:39.840
then turn around,
and keep your hands behind your back.

50:39.920 --> 50:42.200
Who are you? I didn't do anything.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.200
We'll discuss all that later.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.880
There's a good spot. Over there, yeah.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.520
Yes, Mr. Öner.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.720
We know what
you've been up to with Zincirli Holdings.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.960
The bribes you've taken,
where you hid the money…

51:02.480 --> 51:04.440
We know every single account number.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.840
I'll ask you something.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.560
And you'd better give me
a straight answer because

51:08.640 --> 51:11.880
my finger is getting sore,
and if there's a cramp… You know?

51:12.400 --> 51:15.520
The girl in the photo I sent you,
Burn This World,

51:15.600 --> 51:16.720
where is she?

51:16.800 --> 51:18.000
What did you do to her?

51:18.080 --> 51:19.080
Nothing.

51:19.160 --> 51:21.040
She took the money, I never saw her again.

51:21.800 --> 51:23.800
- How much?
- A hundred thousand.

51:23.880 --> 51:24.920
A hundred grand?

51:26.320 --> 51:29.080
Who is she, Helen of Troy?

51:29.160 --> 51:30.280
Did she blackmail you?

51:31.680 --> 51:33.920
- She stole my computer.
- So you killed her.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.040
I swear I saw that girl two times!

51:36.120 --> 51:39.040
The day she danced
and the day she took the money from me.

51:44.120 --> 51:45.840
- What's the passcode?
- Passcode?

51:45.920 --> 51:47.600
31-07-81.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.720
Your date of birth?

51:50.200 --> 51:51.040
Idiot.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.560
He shared his live location.

51:53.640 --> 51:55.680
"Found you. I'll be there in five."

51:56.640 --> 51:58.960
Who the fuck is coming? Who is it?

51:59.040 --> 52:00.800
- Your bodyguard?
- Uh-huh.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.520
- Is he armed?
- Uh-huh.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.120
Sit down.

52:10.600 --> 52:11.680
Tie his feet.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.520
You got a mask?

52:19.880 --> 52:21.040
Are you done?

53:24.240 --> 53:25.560
Stop!

53:38.160 --> 53:39.920
No.

53:40.560 --> 53:41.400
No.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.280
He was coming towards you.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.360
Go to the car.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.120
Come on.

54:20.120 --> 54:22.400
Where's the computer
you took from the girl?

54:23.000 --> 54:23.840
Huh?

54:24.680 --> 54:25.520
Right.

54:27.520 --> 54:28.640
At home.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.640
Sadık, are you crazy? Get in!

54:35.480 --> 54:36.560
Just a minute.

54:38.200 --> 54:40.240
Get in! Let's get out of here!

55:01.960 --> 55:02.920
Nice place.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.520
On a civil servant's salary?

55:10.320 --> 55:13.480
Or was it a gift from
one of those reputable friends?

55:15.280 --> 55:17.360
Pull the car up to the place.

55:19.480 --> 55:20.440
Go on.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.960
All right, Mr. Öner. Speak.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.640
What do you want from me?

55:37.680 --> 55:39.240
I want an answer from you.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.840
What did you do to Burn This World?

55:41.920 --> 55:45.280
I swear, it's like I told you.
I only saw her twice. That's it.

55:45.800 --> 55:48.480
What's in this computer?
Some kind of treasure?

55:51.480 --> 55:52.440
Private stuff.

55:53.080 --> 55:54.880
- Private stuff?
- Uh-huh.

55:54.960 --> 55:57.080
Private stuff worth 100,000 dollars?

55:59.360 --> 56:01.200
- That's why you killed her?
- No!

56:01.280 --> 56:02.960
I swear I did no such thing.

56:03.480 --> 56:05.840
When she brought the computer back,

56:07.240 --> 56:09.680
someone hopping like a bunny
grabbed the money from me.

56:09.760 --> 56:10.840
I was confused.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.280
And the rest of the 500,000
you got from Zincirli?

56:14.360 --> 56:16.040
In the safe in the closet.

56:17.480 --> 56:20.320
- What's the combination of the safe?
- 6936.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.440
What's the passcode?

57:08.280 --> 57:10.360
75-42-75-42.

57:12.960 --> 57:15.000
DTS.PLAY BOX

57:19.960 --> 57:21.000
<i>Let me go!</i>

57:24.320 --> 57:25.680
<i>- Let go!</i>
<i>- Don't yell!</i>

57:27.840 --> 57:28.840
<i>Let go!</i>

57:29.400 --> 57:30.400
<i>Help!</i>

57:34.200 --> 57:35.040
<i>Let go!</i>

57:49.800 --> 57:50.720
You scumbag.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.160
Speak.

57:56.080 --> 57:57.920
Listen, that girl…

57:58.000 --> 58:00.080
was obviously headed for that path.

58:01.480 --> 58:02.800
Let me go.

58:02.880 --> 58:05.240
I can be of use to you, to your agency.

58:06.200 --> 58:07.280
Money, jobs.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.480
Be rational.

58:12.880 --> 58:15.840
- Good idea. I'll be rational.
- Uh-huh.

58:16.480 --> 58:17.480
Good.

58:20.960 --> 58:22.760
I mean, you make a good point.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.360
- Do you have a cigarette?
- In the bag.

59:00.640 --> 59:03.760
You've been silent for half an hour.
What happened?

59:04.360 --> 59:06.840
We added the second plot twist
in the first mystery.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.240
What did you do to him?

59:10.840 --> 59:12.520
He asked me to be rational,

59:12.600 --> 59:13.760
and I was.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.120
God, I'm going crazy!

59:15.200 --> 59:17.440
This is where
your literary curiosity led us to!

59:17.520 --> 59:18.600
Look at us!

59:18.680 --> 59:20.880
Deniz Gökyaylı. She's the guilty one.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.240
Who the hell is that?

59:25.160 --> 59:27.440
An editor who brought up
the curiosity element.

59:29.560 --> 59:30.880
You're definitely bad.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.600
Yes, Zeynel?

59:33.680 --> 59:35.760
<i>Our mutt stopped at a door.</i>

59:36.400 --> 59:37.840
Some guy let it in.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.320
I bet they know each other.

59:41.080 --> 59:44.000
We're staking the place out.
We'll deal with him if he comes out.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.360
<i>No, don't do anything.</i>

59:45.440 --> 59:48.480
<i>You just keep watching.</i>
<i>We'll deal with that tomorrow, okay?</i>

59:48.560 --> 59:50.600
If you say so. All right, bro.

59:51.520 --> 59:55.320
Keep an eye on the bag.
There's money and a computer in it. Bye.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.320
<i>Why didn't you tell me everything?</i>

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.640
You stole money from a guy called Öner.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.920
The one who took the money
was hopping like you.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.000
So you were really looking for her.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.640
Who told you this? Was it Muti, bro?

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.000
No, the man you blackmailed. Öner.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.400
Where's Muti?

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.920
I have no idea where Muti is.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.880
She was pissed at me.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.280
I wouldn't let her spend the money.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.520
I hid it.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.640
So Muti steals from Öner,
and you from her?

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.240
Stealing what, bro?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.040
She found a secondhand
piece-of-shit sports car

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.480
and insisted on buying it.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.600
So we had a fight.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.000
We were supposed to move to Kaş.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.080
We promised each other.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.960
When I didn't give her the money,

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.200
she said she knew
another way to get money and left.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.760
Do you know why this leg is messed up?

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.280
Muti was about ten years old.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.080
Two big boys cornered her
in a construction site.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.120
You know, for that kind of thing.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.760
<i>They were roughing her up</i>
<i>when I got there.</i>

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.480
I dove at them from behind.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.480
Just like Fernando Muslera.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.000
<i>All three of us fell over the edge.</i>

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.080
<i>I broke my leg.</i>

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.040
But one of those assholes
had a fractured backbone.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.160
He was bedridden for a year.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.960
The other one cracked his skull.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.040
He's still an idiot.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.360
And I'm still crippled.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.800
Where the hell is that girl?
Any idea where we can find her?

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.880
I searched every nook and cranny.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.800
What if Öner found her?

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.240
No, he can't.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.800
He had an accident.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.000
Okay, but really, man,
why are you looking for my girl?

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.000
Because of literary and dramatic concerns.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.360
Don't you see how interesting
Mutena's story turned out to be?

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.720
I may write about it.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.400
Bro, trust me, if Muti says, "Here I am,"
I'll give her the money instantly.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.960
She can spend all the money
on that stupid sports car for all I care.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.360
But if somebody has hurt her,
I swear I'll kill them.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.120
If someone has laid a hand on her,

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.560
leave them to me, okay?

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.520
DAY 7

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.640
<i>"Second street past the fountain.</i>
<i>No. 12. The mutt's there."</i>

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.880
Okay, good.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.160
Hello? Is this Mukhtar Abdullah Ketenci?

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.920
This is Murtaza calling from Eskişehir.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.240
We own a chain
of boutique hotels in Eskişehir.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.600
We recently conducted a field survey

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.840
and found there were some
promising properties in your neighborhood.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.560
In fact, my team
has found a building they like.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.040
I'll give you an address--

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.000
Can I call you back in a bit?

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.200
- What happened?
- I saw the videos.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.360
That sick fuck!
People like him don't deserve to live…

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.480
Okay, I understand.
You were right to do what you did.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.920
Come here. Okay.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.880
- Did you take care of the other thing?
- I did.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.640
I put all of Öner's emails
with Yüksel Zincirli in a folder.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.400
Remember those mega towers on TV
touted as the investment of the century?

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.560
The piece of land
they are building those towers on

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.480
is officially deemed
as protected woodland.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.800
If Öner's department does not object to
the new environmental report and zoning,

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.080
the project will become
suitable for investment.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.840
Douchebags.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.320
Hey, I'm really feeling down.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.600
Can we go out for breakfast?

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.400
- Alone.
- Sure.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.560
Can you help me cover this up?

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.760
- Don't want it to look bad in public.
- I'll take care of it.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.200
Chief? Your guy just came out.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.280
Okay. The man's name is Nedim Kıtıl.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.240
He's a strip club photographer.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.080
Chief, do you have
some kind of psychic powers?

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.360
The guy's holding a camera right now.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.160
There's a birdie in Balat.
The Mukhtar bird. He told me.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.160
Okay, be careful. Bye.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720
The problem…

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.720
is still the first mystery.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.800
When Metelik stashed the money,

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.200
Mutena disappeared,
saying she knew where to find more money.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.040
The question is,

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.120
from whom did she get
the money to buy the expensive car?

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.200
- Yüksel Zincirli?
- Correct.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.640
Yeah, but how will we interrogate him?
He's nothing like Kutsi or Öner.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.880
We can't grab him off the street.
I bet he lives in a fortress.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.320
What if we leak the emails
between him and Öner?

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.120
When the cleaner arrives tomorrow,
there'll be a ruckus.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.560
Then, Yüksel will come out of his hole.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.800
You can't hunt prey in its lair.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.880
Bro.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.160
That's Nedim there,
the photographer with the beard.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.440
He met with the others.
They talked as if they were in a fight.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.480
Sıtkı's nephews.
Those are the guys who beat me up.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.200
We have 350,000 dollars from yesterday.
You'll take that, okay?

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.400
Won't cover all the damage Meral did,

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.840
but at least it's a start.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.360
Bro, we talked about money.
Don't embarrass us.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.800
I killed two men yesterday.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.160
We get it, Chief.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.000
No worries, bro.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.480
He's here.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.800
- House is clear.
- Thanks.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.440
Wow, look at that.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.560
What the hell is this? What is this? Huh?

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.600
Well, Mr. Nedim…

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.280
Let's cut to the chase.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.080
Was Sıtkı killed for money,

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.400
or was it because Şermin's affair
with his nephew Burak was exposed?

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.840
What affair?
There was no affair, there wasn't.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.320
She only loved me.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.560
We've been together since the club days.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.640
- She married just to get out of there.
- By "together," you mean what?

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.920
We were side by side.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.000
I went wherever she went.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.160
So what happened here, Nedim? Tell me.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.720
Sıtkı beat her a lot.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.160
Day in and day out,
he beat both Şermin and Çiko.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.200
She couldn't take it anymore.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.080
I told her many times,
"Let me kill that guy."

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.200
She wouldn't let me.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.680
She said, "I can't live without you.
You're my only friend."

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.480
She loved me in her own way.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.480
Very much.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:03.920
<i>Okay.</i>

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.360
You loved her, she loved you.
We get it, you didn't kill her.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.600
But someone killed Sıtkı. Who?

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.400
- Burak. Burak killed him.
- The nephew?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.160
<i>That bastard was obsessed</i>
<i>from the moment they met.</i>

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.200
<i>It only took three days</i>
<i>for her to get in his head.</i>

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.200
<i>She gave him the idea.</i>

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.680
Idea?

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.840
Burak promised he would kill him
so they could be together.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.120
But at the last minute,
he said he couldn't. He got scared.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.200
He didn't want to kill his uncle.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.280
When he flaked out, it was up to me.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.080
Oh, so you guys decided
to pin the murder on me, right?

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.680
Why me?

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.920
You were a loser.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.040
<i>You had no relationship with anyone,</i>
<i>you were alone.</i>

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.680
<i>I left Çiko on the doorstep.</i>

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.320
<i>Then Şermin dropped by,</i>
<i>befriended that woman, went inside.</i>

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.040
<i>She got her drunk.</i>

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.800
<i>And when she passed out,</i>
<i>we took the photos.</i>

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.040
Şermin was going to go on a trip,
and I was going to kill Sıtkı.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.360
But just as we planned everything,
rumors started.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.440
I guess Sıtkı found out
about Şermin and Burak.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.520
He killed my love.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.200
<i>I guess he wanted to kill Burak too.</i>

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.840
<i>He asked him to come over,</i>
<i>but Burak came armed.</i>

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.280
<i>He acted fast. He shot Sıtkı.</i>

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.640
<i>My guys saw you talking to Burak.</i>

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.720
<i>They said it was a heated argument.</i>
<i>What did you do? Blackmail him?</i>

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.000
<i>They burned down houses on the block.</i>
<i>They made a ton of money.</i>

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.240
<i>- How much?</i>
<i>- 300,000.</i>

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.120
<i>What did you blackmail him with?</i>

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.600
<i>I ran there when I heard gunshots.</i>

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.160
<i>I took his photo.</i>

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.080
Good job, Nedim.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.920
These are great shots.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.120
Zeynel, take his phone.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.960
So, tell me, Nedim,
when will Burak bring the money?

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.840
Chief, he's here. Parking the car.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.160
Let's go.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.520
Fuck.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.760
Hüso, it is not Burak.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.040
- You take him. I'll get the back door.
- Okay, go.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:36.960
Wait.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.440
What the hell? Who are you? Where's Nedim?

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.320
Shut the fuck up!
Shut your mouth! Shut it!

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.880
- This bag is empty. Empty!
- What?

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.800
Looking for someone, you son of a bitch?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.800
Drop your gun! Drop it!

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.320
Move over here. Are you guys idiots?

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.560
Did you think we'd fall into your lap?

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.360
- So you've got a secret entrance there?
- Exactly.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.840
For when I came here to fuck Şermin,

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.360
to avoid being seen
by the neighbors, you know…

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.120
- What did you do to Saldıray?
- Nothing. We just broke his arm.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.400
You assholes.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.840
If anything happens to him,
I'll fuck you up.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.040
Where's Nedim?

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.720
- I'd worry about Zeynel, not Nedim.
- Who the fuck is Zeynel?

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.760
My arm!

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.840
Did you kill Sıtkı with this gun?

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.800
- We have your photos with Şermin.
- Son of a bitch!

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.280
And we recorded Nedim's confession,
so that's all the evidence we need.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.960
- The cops will handle the rest.
- I'll fuck you up!

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.120
The second mystery is solved.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.600
SUSPICIOUS ZONING MURDERS
FIRST HIS BODYGUARD, THEN HIM

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.560
DAY 8

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.480
<i>Mr. Murtaza, this is Abdullah Ketenci,</i>
<i>the mukhtar in Balat.</i>

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.800
Yes, Mr. Mukhtar.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.920
<i>The owner of the building</i>
<i>you were asking about, Nedim Kıtıl,</i>

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.840
turns out he's been involved with a gang.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.800
Oh!

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.360
<i>The same gang that killed</i>
<i>realtor Sıtkı and his wife.</i>

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.160
- What're you saying?
- You dodged a bullet there.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.880
But I can suggest other lots
for your hotel investment.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.160
Okay, let me speak with my people,
and we'll call you back.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.400
<i>Let's talk next week.</i>

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.960
I'm going out of town for a few days.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.480
Got it, Mr. Mukhtar, you'll be away.
We'll meet next week.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.880
- We'll call you back. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.400
Our Zincirli leak exploded.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.640
See, they also made
the connection to the murder of Öner.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.400
But Yüksel Zincirli is missing.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.920
Let's see.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.880
Kutsi, what's up?

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.240
This is your friend, the agent.
How are your kids?

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.320
<i>- Please don't.</i>
- Don't worry. Everything's fine.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.640
We need some information from you.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.800
Where is this Yüksel?

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.040
<i>I don't know, Mr. Agent.</i>
<i>Nobody knows, I swear.</i>

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.320
Kutsi, tell your wife

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.720
to be extra cautious
when leaving home today.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.600
God forbid she has an accident.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.520
<i>The cops went to his ranch.</i>
<i>And he's not at his father's.</i>

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.880
Okay, stop crying.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.360
Does this prick have a girlfriend?

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.640
Speak, damn it!

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.320
Look, I'll come to your house
and be your worst nightmare.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.640
<i>No, I'll send you her contact information.</i>

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.920
<i>And her photo.</i>

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.960
That's it, okay. Nice. Good job.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.280
Say hi to your wife. Bye.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.360
That was convincing, but don't you think
you're talking too much?

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.600
You're too chatty.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.480
- We're <i>vigilantes</i>, girl.
- What, Chief?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.720
<i>Vigilantes. </i>It means
taking the law into your own hands.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.760
- Oh. So you're saying we're the law.
- Kind of.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.360
I like that!

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.760
Come on, Çiko, go on!

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.720
GÜLHAN KÖSEOĞLU
MY PLACE, TOMORROW EVENING

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.840
I'll go check it out.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.920
Kordela? What kind of a name is that?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:30.840
DAY 9

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.160
For me, it's even weirder than Mutena.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.680
Şermin was good. May she rest in peace.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.080
Chief, someone's coming out.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.360
It's her.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.760
I know you'll get mad at me,
but I'm starving.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.360
We'll wait a bit.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.960
I wonder if there are
any sausages in those bags.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.800
Get her!

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.560
Easy!

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.280
Get in.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.480
Police!

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.200
Hey! What's happening?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
We are detaining you
for aiding and abetting a murder suspect.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.040
Cuff her.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.280
Answer my questions or you'll face
an obstruction of justice charge too.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.120
Is the suspect inside?
Is he alone? Is he armed?

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.200
Wait a minute.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.360
You don't have any badges.
You're not cops!

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.440
Let me go!

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.800
Kordela Çetin.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.360
We are not cops, which means
we can easily hurt you and your family.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.040
What if the cops learned about
what happened here?

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.440
Or your husband?

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.160
He's alone, doesn't have a gun.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.080
Nice. Gag her.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.800
Why the gag? I told you already! Why--

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.040
All right, let's see
what your lover has ordered.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.400
Two bottles of Scotch.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.240
Hey, Hüso, tough luck, man.
No sausages. No food at all.

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.240
Passcode for the exterior door, 8943.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.520
Passcode for the main door, 46983.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.240
Zeynel, come on, let's go.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.360
46983.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.880
- Peace be with you.
- Who are you?

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.840
- Calm down.
- Easy.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.360
Sit down.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120
Who are you? What do you want?

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.240
We are agents.
With a focus on collections.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.560
There is this dancer girl,
she owes us some commission.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.040
Her name is Mutena, AKA "Burn This World."

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.920
- You are not cops, right?
- No.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.120
Good. What is your name?

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.760
Öcal Vigilante.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.880
Can't recall that last name.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.280
Why would I deal with dancers?
There's a mistake.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.720
She's the one blackmailing you
with the emails Öner got.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:57.840
Öner…

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.480
Did <i>you </i>kill him?

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:04.720
Like you, he didn't tell the truth
during his interrogation.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.480
Where is she?

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.680
Did you kill her during the delivery?

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.240
- No. No.
- Hey!

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:13.560
My guys missed her.

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.240
- She distracted one, a guy sprayed gas--
- Tell the truth!

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.480
I don't know where she is
or the weird guy who took the bag.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.160
Same scenario again.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.720
Weird guy. Weird how?

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.640
Hops like a bunny? Bouncing up and down?

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.840
I don't know about the hopping,
but he had a weird muffled laugh.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.640
He mocked my guys.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.280
Listen, if it's about money,
we can take care of it.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.920
It just doesn't work.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.040
Someone hopping like a rabbit,
a funny laugh guy.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.760
I thought I had the entire plot
and the mystery solved,

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.240
but you added another plot twist.
You're a huge disappointment.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.520
I repeat, we can
take care of your commission.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.360
What's the passcode?

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.560
- Give me the passcode!
- 153864.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.000
Listen, inside my safe
is more money than you'd ever dream of.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.360
The passcode is those first four digits.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.840
If it's something else,
we'll take care of that too.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.600
I can offer you something that nobody can.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.760
A virus test.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.360
And immune plasma therapy.
I have the blood with antibodies in stock.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.640
It can beat COVID or anything.
You can't find it even for millions.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.320
See. That's it.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.920
Mr. We'll-Take-Care-of-It.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160
Yüksel.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.800
I hate people like you. Seriously.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.800
You make me sick.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.440
"We'll take care of it."

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.400
There's a protected forest.
“We'll take care of the zoning permit.”

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.920
There's a COVID outbreak.
"Let the poor squirm and die."

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
"We've got blood with antibodies.
We'll take care of it."

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.520
Take care of this and that…

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.800
I've got an issue with my plot,
can you take care of that?

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.440
"We'll take care of it" means what?
Is it how the rich say, "I'm untouchable"?

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.360
Who are you? What are you saying?

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.840
Yüksel, I'm a man of fiction.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.000
The pain can be considerable,

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.800
but no man of fiction
could resist a dramatic end like this.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.000
I've always been
a sucker for a tragic ending.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.200
No!

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.280
Bro…

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.400
Fuck.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.640
Bro, what did you do?

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.240
See?

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.360
He couldn't take care of it.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Are you done?

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.560
Go to Hüso. I'll write a suicide note.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.000
For your father.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.600
If you shout, I'll gag you again.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.480
He'll make you pay.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.280
Your boyfriend killed himself.
With the gun he killed Öner with.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.880
I guess the murders, this bribe scandal,
and the shame was too much for him.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.760
Here.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.160
Do you know what's in this?

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.120
One of those glasses
you clinked in a toast.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.800
Your lipstick's on it. Yeah.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.920
And a pair of panties.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.120
We did you another favor

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.640
and deleted all the love messages
on Yüksel's phone.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.440
I guess these are tears of joy.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.400
As for Yüksel,

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:08.360
you don't strike me
as a woman to cry over a man.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.560
Forget everything that happened today
between 10:45 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. Okay?

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.720
Will you untie my hands?

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.000
I need to fix my face.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520
That was quick.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.680
Split this between yourselves.
I won't take no for an answer.

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.240
This hardly covers your loss.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.600
Just spare some for Meral as well, okay?

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.720
But not too much.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.560
- So what's new?
- Don't be evasive.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.680
Will you kill someone tomorrow too?
What the hell? It's like one murder a day.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.040
- Sadık? Are you okay?
- I am.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.520
Let's make tomorrow
your last smoking day, all right?

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.520
Was that wheeze a laugh?
People think it was a COVID cough.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.760
The cough.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.400
<i>- Who are you?</i>
<i>- Ahmet.</i>

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.680
<i>He had a weird muffled laugh.</i>

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:22.840
<i>He mocked my guys.</i>

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.240
Of course.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.000
She knows him. She found him.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.880
Who else could it be? Of course.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.080
- Who found whom? What happened?
- I solved it thanks to you.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.760
You are my muse.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.880
- What am I your muse for?
- Here, I'll tell you.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.200
Here's how the first mystery…

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.680
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.320
- Let's go out back.
- Sure.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.080
- You want something?
- No.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.760
Money fixes everything.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.320
Tomorrow, we'll be
running ads in all the papers,

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.560
and this outrageous campaign will be over.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.480
Thank God.

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:22.480
But the damage is done.
I can't adopt Bugül now.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.120
A single woman
who became the object of such rumors…

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.560
I think I'll take my lawyers' advice.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.160
Which is?

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.880
Would you like to marry me?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.960
I mean, it's only for a while.
Until I adopt Bugül.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.600
I get it. Why me?

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.080
You're dependable.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.480
Buket trusted you. And she was right.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.240
You kept our secret.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.960
Don't answer right away.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.520
Think about it for a while.
Then we will talk again.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.680
Besides…

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.960
- l can--
- No, no way. I can't accept that.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.640
You should already know
I'd never think you'd accept my money.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.880
Though, I also know
that everyone has a price.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.080
Your price is Pınar.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.640
So, if I were to buy you,

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.000
it would include her.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.480
What if I guarantee her education

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.680
and promise a bright future
for her at the Köseoğlu Group?

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.920
And another perk as well.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.880
That apartment you're living in…

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.040
it's yours.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.720
It will only be a few years.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.080
You can keep writing there
until we get divorced.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.840
Would you like to see Bugül?

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320
No.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.960
Little girls always make me cry.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.040
I'll think about it.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:40.240
DAY 10

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.600
Remember the mukhtar we met in Balat?

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.280
- Uh-huh.
- The guy who was a part-time realtor.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:48.360
I need you to call him.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.200
Tell him you're calling
for Mr. Murtaza from Eskişehir.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.920
Murtaza is me, by the way.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.120
Say, "He spoke with you earlier."

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.600
"We want to see suitable properties
for boutique hotels."

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.400
- But ask him for today. It's important.
- Okay.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.000
And he'll tell you,

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.120
"I'm out of town. Talk to my assistant."

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.240
That's Ahmet,
but don't let him know that you know.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.800
- Make an appointment with him.
- Okay.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.200
- Sadık?
- Hmm?

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.680
No killing on the schedule today, right?

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.800
Promise me.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.400
I promise.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.920
RENOWNED BUSINESSMAN
FOUND DEAD IN HIS HIDEOUT

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.800
Hi, Öcal.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.080
You drive. I'll be in the backseat.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.520
- What is it, bro? Did you find Muti?
- We'll see.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.720
Bro, what is it that you really do?
You said something about writing…

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.800
That's true, I deal in fiction.
Like, different scenarios.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.200
Oh, for TV shows, bro?

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.560
The cough is my asthma,
not COVID. Welcome.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.600
It's okay, get in the other side.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.920
Mr. Murtaza.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.040
Take a right at the alley
next to the Balat Mosque--

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.760
Go to Surdibi. Drive.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:02.480
I know how a cough
can be confused with laughter sometimes.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.840
Listen, I'll ask this once.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:12.280
Muti, Mutena,
Burn This World, your neighbor upstairs,

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.560
where is she?

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.000
I know you kept the money
you stole from Yüksel Zincirli.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.440
The men heard you wheezing
and thought you were laughing.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.480
What did you do? Did you kill her?

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.520
Wait a minute.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.560
Do you miss me already?

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.320
<i>Something weird just happened.</i>

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.800
<i>Ms. Gülhan called</i>
<i>and invited us both to dinner.</i>

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.240
<i>I mean, isn't that weird? Hello?</i>

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:40.800
<i>Aren't you surprised?</i>
<i>I told her I'd ask you. At eight--</i>

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.760
I'm very surprised too.
Eight o'clock is fine.

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.880
<i>Okay, don't be late. What are you doing?</i>

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.320
I'm a little bit busy.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:52.000
- I'm about to kill someone.
<i>- You maniac.</i>

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.880
Okay, see you.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.680
Speak.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:12.680
<i>Bro, we're stuck in traffic.</i>
<i>Text me your location.</i>

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:16.120
<i>And put the phone in your pocket</i>
<i>without hanging up. We'll keep listening.</i>

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.200
Okay, see you.

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.080
Here.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.600
There's only Mutena in there, right?

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.080
Don't fucking move! Hands up!

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.200
Take his gun.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.520
I said hands up!

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:07.640
Come here.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.680
Come.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.720
Come on. Get inside. Move.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.080
Wow.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.200
Clever.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.640
Someone knocks on a door,
and you come out the other one.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.240
Move. Come on. Get over there.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.480
Sit right there.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.400
Sit down.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.920
- Who are they? Why did you bring them?
- They trapped me.

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.120
Where are you looking at?

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.200
I'm trying to see if Mutena's here.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.040
Who the fuck are you?

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.440
Today, I'm going by the name Ziya,
but it's Öcal Vigilante.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.480
Are you a foreigner?
Who the fuck sent you?

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.240
Deniz Gökyaylı.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:12.920
She's my editor.
She said my plot was weak.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.680
I had to add some mystery
and elements of curiosity, so here I am.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.760
Is he crazy or what?

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.320
Ziya… Öcal is in TV show business,
a fiction guy.

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.800
What is your name?

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:28.200
Wow, Mr. Vigi, you have balls.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.520
Looking into my eyes while talking to me.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:35.200
Let's say I'm Kerim for today.
Maybe I'll make it into a show.

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.280
Sure.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:45.080
Scene one, abandoned house.

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.400
Interior, day.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.720
Characters, Vigilante, Metelik, Ahmet.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.320
Our heroes slowly climb the stairs.

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.400
They knock on the door
of room number three.

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.880
No one answers.

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.440
Then suddenly, from behind,
they hear someone yelling, "Don't move!"

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.440
Shut up!

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:05.000
They turn around,
they see this armed man named Kerim.

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.160
Stop yelling!

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:09.800
Scene two, it turns out
the two apartments are joined.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.640
- Their doors are facing each other.
- The building's empty. Shout all you want.

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:17.040
I'm not going to ask again.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.280
Who are you, and how did you find Ahmet?

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.920
Don't ask me, ask Ahmet.

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.840
We didn't force him to do anything.
He sold you out!

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.440
If you'd opened that door,
you'd be sitting here.

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.640
Sacit, bro, I swear he's lying.

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.640
- Wasn't it real estate business?
- It was.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:41.360
Put the gun to their heads.
Shoot if any of them moves.

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.800
He's gonna kill you too.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.600
Hey!

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.440
Bro, you got this, I'll go check Hüso.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.880
Metelik, come here!

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:15.800
Sit on him, don't let him move.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.480
It stinks in here.
I bet there's COVID in here, Chief.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.800
- Where's the guy?
- Here. I shot him in the leg.

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.280
I have to tell you, Chief,
you're a great strategist.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.960
You drew us a map
by shouting over the phone.

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.800
What happened to your ear?

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.680
- What took you so long?
- Don't even ask.

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.640
We were handling two guys
that were following you,

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.040
to protect that limping guy
with you, you know?

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:47.320
We took care of them.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.080
They're from Malatya.
Probably sped the 1,000 km home already.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.480
You're getting too chatty.

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.760
Shut the fuck up!

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.160
Get out of here!

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:05.400
- I'm not giving you any money, bastard!
- What the hell?

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.320
- Son of a bitch! Move!
- What the hell? Don't hit me!

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.480
- You'll give that money!
- Get out!

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:11.840
Get out!

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.080
- Don't hit me, don't!
- Go!

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.360
<i>Mutena didn't give you your cut,</i>

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.160
<i>and she beat you up pretty badly.</i>

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:25.080
So you asked Sacit to help get the money.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.040
I got you now.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.760
Let go of me! Let go!

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.200
<i>How do you know Sacit?</i>

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.520
<i>He's one of Sıtkı's guys.</i>

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.720
- The one burning down the houses.
- So he's an arsonist.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:45.640
Okay, let's get to the real question.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.560
Where's Mutena?

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.040
Where's Mutena?

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.720
Where is she?

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:05.840
Chief!

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.120
You watch him.

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.160
How long?

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.560
Five or six days.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.200
Let go of me!

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.560
Let go!

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:48.960
Don't yell!

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.320
Stop squirming.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.120
You can shout all you want.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:04.760
I'm late.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.160
Hüso.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.760
You said if anyone touches Mutena,
they'd have to answer to you.

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.640
You two were supposed
to move to Kaş, right?

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.400
That bastard…

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.400
has erased Kaş off the map for you.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.120
Go on.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:07.200
Bro, I found the money
they snatched from Yüksel.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.400
Since Kerim the arsonist is occupied…

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.000
You know how you'll die, rat?

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.720
Choking on your own cough.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.240
My name is Muslera now.

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.640
Please don't! No!

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.440
Please don't! Don't burn me!

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:01.440
Don't burn me! Please!

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.280
So ends the first mystery,
the story of Burn This World.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.200
Why do you think Ms. Gülhan's invited us?

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.680
To her home, of all places. For dinner.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.760
She wants to know my answer.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.560
She asked me to marry her.

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.720
- What?
- What the hell?

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.680
What are you talking about?

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.360
Stop grinning and speak!
What marriage proposal?

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.640
You know what?
On second thought, this is not a bad plan.

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.560
One, you are very trustworthy.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.480
You'll get a divorce
once the adoption process is complete.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:24.080
Two, no matter
the clauses in the agreement,

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.720
who's to say this temporary husband
won't blackmail them?

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.760
Maybe he won't give up custody of Bugül.
Very risky business.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.800
Yeah.

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:35.520
It's a pretty great plan.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.840
What is your point?

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.320
This could turn out to be
a win-win deal both for Gülhan and us.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.920
- Such a charlatan.
- Think about it.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.840
The flat we're living in will be ours.
We have a great view.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.120
You can keep writing.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.960
Gülhan will have you under her thumb
until I graduate from college.

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.760
An amazing plan.

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:00.920
How do I answer this?

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:02.960
You speak.

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.240
- Hüso, I'm listening.
<i>- Chief.</i>

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.600
<i>They say we'll be</i>
<i>on lockdown for the weekend.</i>

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.960
<i>People are ransacking</i>
<i>the supermarket I'm at,</i>

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.080
<i>buying whatever food they can find.</i>

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.120
<i>I'm sending you a list.</i>
<i>I bought food for Çiko.</i>

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.080
<i>But check out the list</i>
<i>and tell me if we need anything else.</i>

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.400
<i>Do not laugh.</i>
<i>This place is literally a war zone.</i>

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.680
<i>It's getting hard to defend my spot.</i>

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.000
<i>Hurry up! We'll starve to death, damn it!</i>

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.960
BASED ON THE NOVEL
"TEN DAYS OF A CURIOUS MAN"
