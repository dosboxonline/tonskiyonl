03:51.997 --> 03:53.676
Sorry, we're closed.

03:54.677 --> 03:55.437
Says who?

04:08.598 --> 04:10.478
Write something. We'll all sign.

04:11.158 --> 04:13.638
On this prank, I'm covering no one.

04:17.918 --> 04:19.798
Let's wait for RenÃ©!

04:24.599 --> 04:26.479
Move your ass. Do what I said!

04:28.279 --> 04:29.839
Clear out or I'll call the cops!

04:29.999 --> 04:31.800
Cops don't scare us!

04:34.520 --> 04:35.600
Down, everyone!

04:35.760 --> 04:37.479
Noses on the floor! Move it!

04:39.639 --> 04:40.599
Strip!

04:41.880 --> 04:42.919
Kill me instead!

04:45.840 --> 04:47.240
A short poem...

04:50.561 --> 04:51.921
I wrote it, so listen!

05:00.041 --> 05:00.961
"Eddy...

05:02.561 --> 05:04.081
"Loyal friend, goodbye,

05:04.241 --> 05:05.921
"Prince of the B.R.I.!

05:08.561 --> 05:10.202
"You're a man so true,

05:10.361 --> 05:12.041
"We will all miss you.

05:12.281 --> 05:13.962
"Beloved by everyone,

05:14.122 --> 05:16.042
"Without enemies, not a one.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.282
"You're so dear...

05:18.442 --> 05:19.362
Shaddup!

05:21.402 --> 05:24.362
"That we'll all shed a tear,

05:26.122 --> 05:29.322
"A new life you've found,
now you're Riviera-bound,

05:30.002 --> 05:32.162
"Why go away,
leaving Titi this way?"

05:37.043 --> 05:38.323
Great, Titi!

05:51.124 --> 05:52.324
The gift!

06:11.245 --> 06:14.965
We'll see you soon, dear Eddy!

06:15.125 --> 06:18.726
We'll meet again, for sure!

07:14.409 --> 07:15.409
Shit, guys!

07:15.729 --> 07:16.489
A mouse!

08:41.054 --> 08:41.695
Let's split!

08:58.095 --> 08:59.575
Bye, thanks.

09:00.095 --> 09:02.735
- How you getting home?
- A ride with Smao.

09:02.896 --> 09:04.296
- OK, Big Luc.
- Titi!

09:05.855 --> 09:07.256
You forget anything?

09:09.376 --> 09:10.376
It was in the john!

09:10.775 --> 09:12.096
- Shit!
- I'll say!

09:12.296 --> 09:14.136
In case you see a mouse.

09:14.416 --> 09:15.656
Thanks, Leo.

09:16.336 --> 09:18.817
- I take you home?
- No, I'll take you.

09:19.257 --> 09:21.496
- You're taking me?
- Yeah!

09:21.776 --> 09:23.097
Calling all cars.

09:23.256 --> 09:27.096
Look out for a vehicle,
after armed robbery

09:27.257 --> 09:30.417
by three hooded men,
flight direction unknown.

09:30.577 --> 09:34.097
Calling all cars, re a vehicle

09:34.257 --> 09:38.377
a black wagon,
with 3 hooded men...

09:56.819 --> 09:57.978
Hi, Dennis...

09:58.419 --> 09:59.499
Hi, Leo.

10:01.019 --> 10:01.859
You're wrecks!

10:02.659 --> 10:05.299
Eddy's farewell dinner.
What's the score?

10:07.780 --> 10:10.700
One conveyor dead, one mangled,

10:10.859 --> 10:12.300
1 50,000 Euros gone.

10:13.220 --> 10:13.820
Witnesses?

10:16.260 --> 10:17.140
Only empty offices.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.501
Same guns,
same C4 explosives, same planning.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.460
It's them again.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.501
Look around.

10:31.461 --> 10:33.581
You won't find much,
but go ahead.

10:56.702 --> 10:58.823
The headless man says hi!

11:00.542 --> 11:02.422
Blown away by a mercury bullet.

11:04.103 --> 11:05.943
Eve Verhagen, OCU.

11:06.103 --> 11:07.783
Eddy Valence, BRl.

11:08.303 --> 11:09.943
Yeah, I can read.

11:10.463 --> 11:11.983
Where do you hail from?

11:12.383 --> 11:14.143
Suburban narcotics squad.

11:15.063 --> 11:17.383
Sick of smashing syringes?

11:17.704 --> 11:19.183
You could say that.

11:20.904 --> 11:23.104
Klein is sulking,
stay with him.

11:23.344 --> 11:25.184
Don't chat with the enemy.

11:26.584 --> 11:27.384
We're enemies?

11:28.784 --> 11:31.465
BRl/OCU, it's an old rivalry.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.944
- Aren't we a big family?
- So they say.

11:46.986 --> 11:48.626
She's private property.

11:49.505 --> 11:50.546
Klein's?

11:50.705 --> 11:51.706
Who else?

11:53.066 --> 11:55.426
How could you be pals with him?

11:57.106 --> 11:58.866
He wasn't always like this.

12:23.387 --> 12:24.508
Their names?

12:28.827 --> 12:30.348
Winterstein.

12:32.148 --> 12:33.828
Bruno and Rolf.

12:36.869 --> 12:39.229
The one who did me was Bruno.

12:43.149 --> 12:44.829
Christo warned me:

12:46.429 --> 12:49.309
"Your big mouth
will get you in trouble."

12:51.949 --> 12:53.750
Now it has.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.351
7 vans in 1 8 months

13:13.911 --> 13:17.871
9 conveyors slaughtered,
and a 2 million Euro booty.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.831
The Ministry of the lnterior
sent us a memo.

13:22.471 --> 13:24.111
Asking us, and I quote:

13:24.271 --> 13:26.871
"to tackle the problem head on

13:27.391 --> 13:29.231
"and neutralize the criminals

13:29.392 --> 13:32.392
"who've derided
our forces for too long."

13:35.112 --> 13:36.232
"Too long" is bad!

13:36.392 --> 13:39.993
Means we've been around
for too long, doing nothing!

13:40.192 --> 13:43.192
As of today you're on duty
24 hours a day!

13:43.472 --> 13:44.952
Drop your personal problems,

13:45.672 --> 13:46.953
don't laze on Sundays,

13:47.312 --> 13:50.833
go out and nab that gang of fuckers

13:50.992 --> 13:52.513
before they strike

13:52.873 --> 13:54.393
for the 8th time!

13:56.953 --> 13:58.393
You got that?

14:02.034 --> 14:02.913
Got that,

14:03.073 --> 14:04.674
Capt. Kechichian?

14:05.953 --> 14:08.273
We were up late.
For a good cause.

14:08.673 --> 14:11.234
Sure, loitering in a bar at 2 AM,

14:11.394 --> 14:13.595
after defacing the wall

14:13.754 --> 14:16.514
of a Government building,
how can I fault you

14:16.674 --> 14:18.235
for being so admirable!

14:21.154 --> 14:23.835
- Anything else?
- A lead on the van jobs.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.635
A Serbian arms-dealer:
Victor Dragan.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.435
We got a tip off

14:29.595 --> 14:30.675
from an informant.

14:30.835 --> 14:31.715
A reliable source?

14:32.115 --> 14:33.155
Not at all.

14:34.795 --> 14:35.756
What do you say?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.275
I know the fellow.
A sadistic loner.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.356
Barring a lucky break,

14:41.516 --> 14:42.556
he'll be tough to nail.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.076
Luck can be engineered.

14:45.076 --> 14:45.796
Briefing's over!

14:46.517 --> 14:48.116
Vrinks, you stay.

15:04.557 --> 15:07.837
I've been appointed
Police Commissioner.

15:08.998 --> 15:10.157
As of when?

15:11.998 --> 15:14.398
I take over on Sept 1.

15:14.678 --> 15:16.078
Congratulations.

15:19.038 --> 15:22.159
I hate to leave
before I've cleaned house.

15:23.598 --> 15:25.358
I want that gang, Leo.

15:26.038 --> 15:27.798
As my farewell gift.

15:28.559 --> 15:29.639
You'll get them.

15:32.039 --> 15:33.559
Another thing:

15:33.799 --> 15:35.839
someone will get my desk.

15:38.439 --> 15:39.519
You're the right man.

15:40.879 --> 15:43.000
Klein wants to be Chief.

15:43.199 --> 15:45.399
He wants power, that's different.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.760
But you both qualify:

15:48.239 --> 15:50.520
same rank, seniority,
service rating.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.841
So whoever nails that scum,
will be king.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.201
I don't mix with brass.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.800
It's better than mixing
with whores and hoods.

16:04.241 --> 16:05.120
Times have changed.

16:06.081 --> 16:08.121
Get yourself a new style.

16:09.121 --> 16:12.161
You're an anomaly.
Your men, your methods.

16:13.162 --> 16:16.681
In the police,
now you toe the line, you snap to.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.962
If you don't,
no one will cover for you.

16:20.682 --> 16:22.842
All the brass have caved in.

16:23.002 --> 16:23.722
Even you?

17:15.484 --> 17:17.325
Lay off me, shit!

17:19.125 --> 17:21.525
Who the fuck are you?

17:23.965 --> 17:26.646
Shit, what ya doin'?

17:26.806 --> 17:27.685
Who the fuck are you?

17:27.925 --> 17:29.206
What have I done?

17:29.366 --> 17:31.446
Don't do that, don't!

17:35.526 --> 17:39.167
Lay off Manou, or I'll stuff you
with your brother's head.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.328
Quite a shiv!

18:05.128 --> 18:06.248
War booty.

18:07.528 --> 18:10.248
Creep's gotta
hitchhike buck-naked,

18:10.808 --> 18:11.848
and cuffed!

18:12.008 --> 18:13.368
We shoulda wasted him!

18:14.208 --> 18:15.929
Gotta be ten grand!

18:16.088 --> 18:18.849
A year's pay for a flatfoot.
Those fuckers!

18:19.569 --> 18:20.769
For our slush fund?

18:22.329 --> 18:24.769
No, it's for Manou.

18:29.449 --> 18:30.170
Leo.

18:31.290 --> 18:31.970
Come in.

18:32.890 --> 18:34.170
Hi, Christo.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.410
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.

18:40.570 --> 18:41.770
Let her rest.

18:42.490 --> 18:43.530
She OK?

18:44.810 --> 18:45.730
Just OK.

18:47.011 --> 18:48.651
Still after that van gang?

18:49.731 --> 18:50.930
Still am.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.451
I hear they hit again.

18:54.211 --> 18:55.852
Near the beltway, right?

18:59.051 --> 19:02.412
My only advice is:
when you bust 'em, shoot first!

19:02.572 --> 19:04.131
You know anything?

19:05.372 --> 19:06.851
I'm not a snitch.

19:07.492 --> 19:09.332
Ask your questions elsewhere.

19:13.012 --> 19:14.252
Who worked over Manou?

19:18.532 --> 19:19.772
What do you mean?

19:23.093 --> 19:24.013
Leo...

19:24.613 --> 19:27.093
I'm 46,
I spent 1 8 years in jail.

19:29.493 --> 19:32.213
She's the best thing
that happened to me.

19:33.134 --> 19:34.934
Someone hurt her, I gotta know.

19:35.093 --> 19:37.013
If I tell you, what'll you do?

19:37.173 --> 19:38.533
That's up to me.

19:38.694 --> 19:41.813
You're in trouble
any time you step out of here!

19:42.054 --> 19:43.414
You're a hood, Christo.

19:43.574 --> 19:45.214
With a record for armed robbery.

19:45.414 --> 19:49.494
If you smack your neighbor
over a trifle, you go back to jail!

19:50.415 --> 19:51.495
Manou needs you:

19:51.655 --> 19:53.855
if you go down, so does she.

19:57.174 --> 19:59.215
Screw your cop morality.

19:59.695 --> 20:02.735
Anyway, it's settled.
I dealt with it.

20:03.575 --> 20:05.656
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.

20:10.016 --> 20:11.216
I'll see you out.

20:24.537 --> 20:25.817
Thanks, Leo.

20:26.536 --> 20:27.817
I won't forget.

20:30.537 --> 20:33.297
The guy
you're looking for, Dragan.

20:33.457 --> 20:34.497
I know where he is.

20:35.457 --> 20:37.338
At a chick's place on Borrego St.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.297
Don't ask how I know.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.297
Police! Freeze!

20:43.738 --> 20:44.497
Stay there!

20:46.137 --> 20:46.697
Get up!

21:01.419 --> 21:03.138
Let me hug my kid.

21:13.140 --> 21:14.340
Your wrists!

21:55.142 --> 21:56.222
Sign there.

21:58.342 --> 22:00.222
Have a nice leave, Silien.

22:36.665 --> 22:38.104
Your Puch's in the toolbox.

22:46.025 --> 22:47.625
With a 2nd clip, just in case.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.105
This is dumb, Silien.

22:54.265 --> 22:55.426
You got 3 weeks to do.

22:56.185 --> 22:57.306
Watch the road.

23:10.866 --> 23:12.106
Neat vodka.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.307
You kept Dragan to yourself.

23:26.907 --> 23:28.027
Was that wrong?

23:30.628 --> 23:33.148
Don't they say,
it takes two to tango?

23:36.388 --> 23:38.868
We're not dancing anymore.

23:41.748 --> 23:43.228
Anyway, he was a bum lead.

23:45.789 --> 23:46.668
How do you know?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.748
I know. That's all.

23:58.749 --> 24:01.469
Silien here.
How are you, Captain?

24:03.030 --> 24:04.310
Am I intruding?

24:05.670 --> 24:08.030
Sure, it's after midnight.
Where are you?

24:08.190 --> 24:10.710
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.

24:10.870 --> 24:12.750
On a leave. Wasn't a jailbreak.

24:13.670 --> 24:14.991
I gotta see you fast.

24:15.150 --> 24:16.631
Tonight, I can't.

24:16.990 --> 24:20.510
You'll regret it.
Meet me in 1 hr at "Swann's".

24:24.791 --> 24:25.711
Same again?

24:27.311 --> 24:28.511
No, thanks.

24:31.032 --> 24:32.392
Camille OK?

24:36.831 --> 24:37.951
She's fine.

24:57.473 --> 24:58.633
When did you buy this?

24:58.793 --> 25:00.273
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?

25:00.793 --> 25:03.033
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me

25:03.193 --> 25:05.113
in 4 years. Don't I rate a smile?

25:06.154 --> 25:07.873
This is a favor for a pal inside.

25:08.233 --> 25:11.194
You made me cross Paris
for a lousy scam?

25:11.354 --> 25:12.434
I got a hot tip.

25:13.114 --> 25:15.154
You're a piece of shit.

25:15.834 --> 25:16.394
What is it?

25:16.554 --> 25:18.474
Heavy duty stuff. Real hot tip.

25:19.315 --> 25:20.555
Want it or not?

25:20.835 --> 25:21.594
What's the deal?

25:21.994 --> 25:24.675
Just stay with me.
In a half-hour, it's done.

25:34.195 --> 25:35.395
Here he is.

25:46.915 --> 25:48.596
Stay in the car!

25:52.276 --> 25:52.956
Get going!

26:27.079 --> 26:28.078
Stop it!

26:29.239 --> 26:31.039
Why'd you screw me?

26:31.719 --> 26:32.559
Stop it!

26:33.999 --> 26:34.879
Stop, dammit!

26:35.038 --> 26:36.838
I know who the van gang are.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.039
And their next stunt.

26:41.959 --> 26:43.520
They're in the sticks.

26:44.799 --> 26:46.079
It starts from there.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.720
In exchange, you cover me.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.480
Or get nailed with me.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.160
Who did you waste?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.681
Marcus Zerbib,
his driver and his goon.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.041
Marcus Zerbib?

27:02.920 --> 27:04.921
The guy who put you in jail?

27:05.360 --> 27:07.521
You'll get nabbed right away!

27:07.801 --> 27:09.241
Not with a good alibi.

27:11.161 --> 27:12.321
Now...

27:12.561 --> 27:15.401
you can grab
the worst gang around.

27:17.601 --> 27:18.882
Choose.

27:21.802 --> 27:23.162
OK, let's have it.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.962
I know two of 'em:

27:25.401 --> 27:27.642
Francis Horn
and Robert Boulanger.

27:27.882 --> 27:30.162
They're squatting in St Ouen.

27:30.522 --> 27:32.282
On Captain Glarner St.

27:47.283 --> 27:49.243
- Don't you say hi?
- I hadn't seen you.

27:49.403 --> 27:51.483
- Want a drink?
- I'm with friends.

27:51.643 --> 27:53.403
You got friends now?

27:53.884 --> 27:55.963
Your only friend is me.

27:56.683 --> 27:58.524
If I conk out, you're dead.

27:58.723 --> 28:00.684
Here's my direct line,

28:00.844 --> 28:02.404
so you can't forget it.

28:05.124 --> 28:07.325
Give me a lead, fast.

28:08.604 --> 28:09.884
That gang...

28:11.364 --> 28:12.724
I want their names first.

28:12.885 --> 28:14.845
Nobody knows them, I swear!

28:15.005 --> 28:18.405
I want news from you.
Stay in touch.

28:19.605 --> 28:21.445
So I know you're OK.

28:22.525 --> 28:24.285
Good seeing you again.

29:30.209 --> 29:31.369
How'd you get that?

29:31.530 --> 29:33.330
It's nothing. At work.

29:38.090 --> 29:40.370
Why not tell me what you do?

29:41.530 --> 29:43.330
I don't want to lose you.

30:30.893 --> 30:32.293
You get home late, leave early.

30:35.013 --> 30:37.293
Lots of cops live that way.

30:37.453 --> 30:39.453
Many wind up all alone.

30:40.374 --> 30:41.454
What are you after?

30:42.694 --> 30:44.094
Nothing.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.573
I just do my job.

30:52.455 --> 30:54.375
Get up, lazybones!

30:54.694 --> 30:57.014
- Say: "Morning, Dad".
- Morning, Dad.

30:57.895 --> 30:59.894
And give him a kiss.

31:05.895 --> 31:07.335
No school today?

31:08.135 --> 31:10.535
Never on Wednesday.
You know that.

31:10.696 --> 31:12.896
Yeah, if I knew it's Wednesday.

31:14.175 --> 31:15.376
Mom in?

31:15.535 --> 31:17.335
Rushing as usual.

31:20.856 --> 31:22.136
Thanks for the...

31:22.896 --> 31:23.976
coffee!

31:27.496 --> 31:29.737
My ass is spreading,
that's bad.

31:30.537 --> 31:32.497
I don't mind, I love big asses.

31:33.257 --> 31:35.257
Know what my big ass says to you?

31:35.457 --> 31:36.737
That it misses me.

31:44.217 --> 31:48.617
Sunday's my dad's 70th birthday.
He hopes we'll come.

31:49.098 --> 31:51.538
There'll be a crowd.
You don't have to talk.

31:52.098 --> 31:54.658
- What crowd?
- My mom's family.

31:54.858 --> 31:58.218
Uncles, aunts,
cousins coming from Rome.

31:59.578 --> 32:00.138
We'll see.

32:03.298 --> 32:05.738
Lola, hurry!

32:06.099 --> 32:07.539
Bye, daddy-o.

32:08.699 --> 32:09.819
Bye, honey.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.301
6 slugs were fired.

32:29.780 --> 32:32.021
2 hit the driver,
1 the goon, 3 Zerbib.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.660
No one saw much.
The building's all oldies.

32:35.981 --> 32:39.701
By the time they shuffled
to a window, it was all over.

32:40.420 --> 32:42.421
But the concierge saw a girl

32:42.581 --> 32:44.821
get out of the Merc and run away.

32:45.061 --> 32:47.701
Brunette, red coat, a BJ artist.

32:48.341 --> 32:51.381
Zerbib liked cheap whores.
We'll find her.

32:52.501 --> 32:54.382
That's for Homicide, not us.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.502
You knew him well?

32:59.862 --> 33:02.702
Enough to want to nab his killer.

33:05.503 --> 33:09.343
Vrinks, BRl.
The names Horn and Boulanger.

33:09.902 --> 33:12.023
Give me all you've got.

33:13.143 --> 33:14.582
What's with the Zerbib case?

33:15.503 --> 33:17.543
He was getting a BJ in the car.

33:17.703 --> 33:20.864
Had his dong out
and his pants down.

33:21.023 --> 33:24.863
A concierge saw the girl
leave after the shooting.

33:27.144 --> 33:28.544
She see anything else?

33:28.863 --> 33:31.023
Ask Homicide, it's their baby.

33:33.184 --> 33:34.184
Can I see the telex?

33:47.064 --> 33:48.025
Boulanger.

33:48.265 --> 33:50.224
I got several, which do you want?

33:52.705 --> 33:53.705
Robert.

33:59.946 --> 34:03.346
Francis Horn
and Robert Boulanger, aka Bob.

34:03.945 --> 34:07.186
Horn: armed robbery record.
Wanted for theft,

34:07.346 --> 34:09.985
armed robbery, extortion
and attempted murder.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.186
Weapons freak, ex-mercenary,

34:12.346 --> 34:15.027
trained in Syria, a real psycho.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.266
Boulanger broke from jail

34:17.426 --> 34:20.146
2 years ago, killing a guard
and an officer.

34:20.545 --> 34:23.146
Seems Horn sprung Boulanger

34:23.306 --> 34:25.427
to have him on his team.

34:25.587 --> 34:27.067
I have no other names,

34:27.226 --> 34:29.107
but they operate from here,

34:29.266 --> 34:32.308
a squat beside a warehouse
by the beltway.

34:40.788 --> 34:44.467
First, we find lookouts
and set up surveillance teams.

34:44.789 --> 34:48.947
Smao and Titi will be in the silo
overlooking the squat.

34:49.108 --> 34:51.547
You photograph everyone
coming and going.

34:51.909 --> 34:54.309
You identify all vehicles,

34:54.509 --> 34:57.029
and any lowlifes in the area.

34:59.269 --> 35:02.589
Second, we cordon off the area,
block escape routes,

35:02.750 --> 35:05.709
one team per street in a perimeter

35:05.949 --> 35:08.190
of half a mile within the area.

35:08.350 --> 35:10.469
Third, we advise the local police

35:10.630 --> 35:12.950
we'll be playing
on their turf for a few days,

35:13.110 --> 35:15.430
and to lie low
on the day we make the grab.

35:16.430 --> 35:20.150
No neighborhood investigations
or questioning,

35:20.311 --> 35:23.751
we avoid concierges,
storekeepers, local hangouts.

35:24.630 --> 35:26.951
Klein, OCU.
You don't know me, I know you.

35:27.151 --> 35:29.911
No waves: we settle in, watch and wait.

35:30.070 --> 35:31.151
Know what they'll hit?

35:31.311 --> 35:32.591
No. We can't lose them.

35:32.751 --> 35:36.311
Let's go. Wear bulletproof vests
over your T-shirts.

35:37.071 --> 35:39.151
We have a common friend,

35:39.632 --> 35:41.152
a friend who just died.

35:41.911 --> 35:44.272
Marcus Zerbib, you know him?

35:44.592 --> 35:45.352
He wasn't a friend.

35:49.352 --> 35:51.033
You two were in business.

35:51.872 --> 35:55.512
Some nasty gossips say
he snitched on you 4 years ago.

35:56.393 --> 35:59.312
The guys he snitched on
would fill the phone book.

35:59.793 --> 36:02.153
But only you could gun him down

36:02.312 --> 36:04.993
in cold blood,
during a leave from jail.

36:06.153 --> 36:09.193
Would I waste him
when I have 2 weeks left to do?

36:09.793 --> 36:10.953
What's wrong, Leo?

36:12.114 --> 36:13.954
- Nothing, why?
- Don't kid me.

36:14.513 --> 36:15.753
You're lost, I can tell.

36:18.794 --> 36:21.474
I'm in deep shit,
and I can't discuss it.

36:21.914 --> 36:22.714
Not even with me?

36:24.674 --> 36:25.794
Not even with you.

36:30.115 --> 36:32.315
- Where were you that night?
- With a cop.

36:32.875 --> 36:35.515
HQ's finest cop.
We met at "Swann's"

36:35.675 --> 36:38.355
at 1 AM, we chewed the fat
till 5 AM,

36:38.515 --> 36:40.995
then he dropped me at my hotel. OK?

36:43.035 --> 36:43.836
His name?

36:44.796 --> 36:45.596
Vrinks.

37:03.916 --> 37:05.396
I'll need your boys.

37:05.956 --> 37:06.916
What for?

37:08.837 --> 37:10.596
We located the van gang.

37:12.717 --> 37:13.717
How'd you get the tip?

37:17.158 --> 37:18.437
Know a man called Silien?

37:19.677 --> 37:20.558
Why?

37:20.878 --> 37:23.398
Says he was with you
when Zerbib died.

37:24.518 --> 37:26.478
If he says so, must be true.

37:26.798 --> 37:28.798
Could I have that in writing?

37:29.799 --> 37:31.038
Investigating murders now?

37:31.598 --> 37:33.238
When my snitches get killed.

37:42.359 --> 37:44.279
Those fuckers
give me a giant hard-on.

37:45.359 --> 37:47.679
Some get laid, others freeze!

37:47.999 --> 37:50.319
We're on the wrong team.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.800
No, that's his last fuck.

37:53.399 --> 37:54.200
We'll hump again.

37:55.079 --> 37:55.960
You sure?

37:59.120 --> 38:00.240
Big Luc to Fat Ass.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.081
Mercedes wagon,
local plates, 4 men on board.

38:05.321 --> 38:07.160
It's headed your way.

38:16.681 --> 38:18.561
Long-haired guy is Frank Chenaf.

38:19.401 --> 38:21.881
I nabbed him
for a holdup 1 0 years ago.

38:22.521 --> 38:23.841
A mean fucker.

38:24.001 --> 38:25.121
I don't know the others.

38:27.802 --> 38:29.522
Said and Jamel Attia.

38:32.481 --> 38:34.042
I say it's for tomorrow.

38:34.762 --> 38:36.443
Nabbing 'em in the act's dumb.

38:37.762 --> 38:42.122
They'll fire at us. We may
lose them to avoid bloodshed.

38:44.883 --> 38:45.802
What do you suggest?

38:45.963 --> 38:47.523
We hit 'em at night,

38:48.963 --> 38:51.803
and gun down the lot of them.

38:53.123 --> 38:55.843
What about our ethics code?

38:56.643 --> 38:59.643
I've wiped my ass
with that for years.

39:04.043 --> 39:06.204
They killed 9 men.

39:07.044 --> 39:07.684
9 families

39:07.844 --> 39:12.564
call me every week hoping
I'll have good news at last.

39:13.844 --> 39:15.485
I owe it to them.

39:17.525 --> 39:18.525
It obsesses me.

39:20.165 --> 39:22.845
Stay home,
let Vrinks deal with it.

39:24.805 --> 39:27.285
I've worked 2 years
on this case.

39:28.125 --> 39:30.565
It's my collar
as much as anyone's.

39:33.005 --> 39:34.686
OK, but you'll be back-up.

39:35.246 --> 39:37.406
You only move in on Vrinks's orders.

39:37.566 --> 39:40.046
He and his men are the front line.

39:40.206 --> 39:41.806
He's in charge of this.

39:43.606 --> 39:45.126
Whether you like it or not.

40:38.490 --> 40:40.449
Igor here, they're coming out.

40:41.090 --> 40:44.009
- Headed for the cars.
- Gotcha.

40:58.771 --> 41:00.531
Big Luc here, they're coming out.

41:01.131 --> 41:03.091
Two black SUV's and a Mercedes.

41:09.811 --> 41:12.092
Standby.
I'll advise when they move.

41:13.052 --> 41:15.092
Seurat-Chenaf in the lead car,

41:15.532 --> 41:17.092
the Attia brothers in the second.

41:17.772 --> 41:18.612
And the rest?

41:19.132 --> 41:21.412
- I only see Boulanger.
- The SUV's are off.

41:21.892 --> 41:22.692
They're taking off.

41:23.572 --> 41:24.652
The SUV's are leaving.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.452
Very slowly.

41:31.332 --> 41:32.373
I see them.

41:32.533 --> 41:33.973
They just passed us.

41:42.814 --> 41:44.334
Let 'em leave the area.

41:44.773 --> 41:47.813
Guy and Bernie tail the SUV's.

41:47.974 --> 41:50.494
We tail Horn, Boulanger,
the chick.

41:50.813 --> 41:53.614
We only hit 'em at the warehouse.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.254
I repeat: don't hit 'em here!

41:58.774 --> 42:01.455
The SUV's are stopped
at the entrance.

42:04.934 --> 42:07.134
- Horn and the chick are out.
- We'll be OK.

42:08.295 --> 42:10.095
Armed to the teeth.

42:13.615 --> 42:14.776
Where's he going?

42:15.375 --> 42:16.775
Eve to Dennis. What's up?

42:17.975 --> 42:19.775
What are the orders?

42:23.496 --> 42:25.416
They're about to leave.

42:26.376 --> 42:27.456
Shit, someone's moving!

42:28.096 --> 42:29.896
Klein's headed for the squat.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.536
- He's alone.
- What's he up to?

42:31.696 --> 42:34.456
He's drawn his gun,
headed for them.

42:34.616 --> 42:36.616
Dennis to Leo.
What is this?

42:36.817 --> 42:38.217
What is this? Answer!

42:46.537 --> 42:47.337
Cops, behind you.

42:52.098 --> 42:53.097
Move in at once!

42:53.257 --> 42:54.778
I said: move in now!

43:13.299 --> 43:15.179
- Shit, Big Luc!
- They hit me!

43:51.101 --> 43:51.901
Grenade!

44:02.061 --> 44:04.502
Come on, bitch!
Drop your guns!

44:04.902 --> 44:06.622
Drop your gun, pig!

44:06.782 --> 44:08.342
Drop your guns,
hands on your heads!

44:08.622 --> 44:10.222
Hands on your head!

44:10.902 --> 44:12.622
Come along, bitch!

44:12.983 --> 44:13.622
Let go of her!

44:13.782 --> 44:14.542
Fuck you!

44:15.222 --> 44:16.462
Shut up! Drop your gun!

44:17.503 --> 44:19.823
Drop your gun. I'll waste her!

44:20.223 --> 44:21.063
On your knees!

44:24.063 --> 44:25.823
Kneel! That's better!

44:26.263 --> 44:27.983
Hands behind your head, scumbag!

44:28.343 --> 44:30.903
If you tail me,
I'll waste the bitch!

44:31.063 --> 44:32.624
Don't take her, take me.

44:32.823 --> 44:34.143
You're dead! Stay put!

46:02.829 --> 46:06.109
State police found Eve
lying on the freeway.

46:06.829 --> 46:09.109
She jumped out of the moving car.

47:26.554 --> 47:28.514
Fucker's got some nerve!

47:29.594 --> 47:30.954
Big Luc, Smao...

47:45.475 --> 47:46.795
What does this mean?

49:20.401 --> 49:22.161
The Commissioner didn't like

49:22.321 --> 49:24.921
you and your men's stunt
at the funeral.

49:26.441 --> 49:27.201
Screw him!

49:29.562 --> 49:30.681
I know.

49:32.881 --> 49:34.681
But I'm warning you.

49:35.201 --> 49:36.362
Of what?

49:37.722 --> 49:41.522
Top brass are like old maids:
you don't ream them.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.282
Get your men back in line,

49:45.682 --> 49:47.682
drop the petitions,
the strike threats,

49:48.083 --> 49:50.243
the defaming of Klein.

49:50.403 --> 49:53.442
Klein goofed,
he has to be punished.

49:54.483 --> 49:57.243
That's for lnternal Affairs, not you.

49:58.323 --> 50:00.123
An investigation's under way.

50:00.284 --> 50:02.724
If Klein was responsible
for this fuck-up,

50:02.884 --> 50:04.484
it'll come out.

50:04.924 --> 50:07.924
Taking on Klein
is taking on the hierarchy,

50:08.084 --> 50:09.924
which is
questioning the system.

50:10.924 --> 50:12.164
You can't do that.

50:13.404 --> 50:14.924
So Eddy died in vain?

50:18.805 --> 50:20.565
He died doing his duty.

50:24.405 --> 50:25.684
Sorry.

50:29.765 --> 50:31.045
I owe him the truth.

50:32.245 --> 50:33.765
What's that?

50:34.846 --> 50:36.726
Requests for transfers.
We all signed.

50:38.006 --> 50:39.285
It's Klein or us,

50:40.326 --> 50:41.886
you decide.

51:04.247 --> 51:05.767
It's Dennis.

51:06.847 --> 51:11.048
I hear you're testifying
against me at the inquiry.

51:12.288 --> 51:15.808
Valence's death was Fate, pal.

51:15.968 --> 51:20.048
Stirring up shit
won't bring him back. You agree?

51:21.448 --> 51:22.289
I'm gonna hang up.

51:24.168 --> 51:26.369
You can't do this to me.

51:28.009 --> 51:29.289
You can't.

51:30.848 --> 51:32.249
This job,

51:32.849 --> 51:34.529
is all I have.

51:36.289 --> 51:37.969
So don't crap on me,

51:38.129 --> 51:39.769
or you'll regret it!

52:04.850 --> 52:06.811
- Where is he?
- Room 24, 2nd floor.

52:06.971 --> 52:08.811
- And the witness?
- He split.

52:08.971 --> 52:12.492
He's married and was with a chick,
didn't want any heat.

52:14.171 --> 52:16.732
Pulling strings
is an insult to Valence.

52:17.331 --> 52:20.412
I can't, Dennis.
Some deaths you can't touch.

52:21.011 --> 52:22.131
- Are you refusing?
- No.

52:22.692 --> 52:25.692
As I said, this isn't any old file.

52:25.852 --> 52:28.452
He was a fine cop,
the union backs Vrinks.

52:29.532 --> 52:33.293
Unless we humor them,
Police HQ will be up in arms.

52:35.613 --> 52:39.453
All I can do is try
to convince the board

52:39.613 --> 52:42.213
not to suspend you.

52:43.133 --> 52:45.733
With your record, it should work.

52:46.813 --> 52:48.453
And if it doesn't?

53:25.775 --> 53:27.535
Police! Freeze!

54:29.380 --> 54:31.339
Know why I didn't kill you, Horn?

54:32.539 --> 54:34.260
Death only happens once.

54:35.140 --> 54:36.939
I won't let it surprise you.

54:38.900 --> 54:42.020
You'll wait for it in a cell,
like an idiot,

54:42.941 --> 54:44.140
until you go nuts

54:45.460 --> 54:46.660
from loneliness.

54:47.620 --> 54:48.981
Know what?

54:49.140 --> 54:51.181
One day
I'll be behind your door!

54:53.781 --> 54:54.741
I'll kill you

54:55.381 --> 54:56.942
and your whole family.

54:57.902 --> 54:59.221
I doubt it.

55:04.381 --> 55:06.021
Can I see you a minute?

55:15.902 --> 55:17.182
Boulanger's dead.

55:17.942 --> 55:19.622
A freeway roadblock.

55:19.782 --> 55:22.462
He tried to run it.

55:26.503 --> 55:28.183
Gift from the Commissioner.

55:28.743 --> 55:30.824
With a letter of congratulations.

55:34.663 --> 55:35.943
To be shared among you.

55:36.103 --> 55:37.423
200 Euros.

55:38.383 --> 55:39.984
Doesn't cover Eddy's wreath.

55:45.384 --> 55:48.144
Klein's in front of the board in 2 days.

55:48.304 --> 55:49.064
I know.

55:50.584 --> 55:54.144
Let the system handle it.
If you mess things up,

55:55.065 --> 55:56.585
they'll make you pay for it.

55:57.745 --> 55:58.865
Where do you stand?

56:00.584 --> 56:01.585
Me...

56:04.065 --> 56:05.506
I've already left.

56:52.188 --> 56:53.588
Evening, Captain.

56:54.749 --> 56:56.268
I hear things are edgy at HQ.

56:57.349 --> 56:59.428
It's a problem for cops.

57:00.229 --> 57:01.668
Not for you.

57:02.429 --> 57:05.589
- That why you wanted to see me?
- No, for my girlfriend.

57:06.189 --> 57:07.429
She got busted.

57:07.869 --> 57:11.389
They claim she's hooking
and gave it to the Aliens Office.

57:12.509 --> 57:14.470
She may be expelled and fined.

57:14.989 --> 57:16.069
What do I care?

57:17.029 --> 57:17.829
The Zerbib affair

57:18.430 --> 57:19.670
interest you?

57:20.429 --> 57:20.989
Go on.

57:22.310 --> 57:23.470
He died in her mouth.

57:25.350 --> 57:27.470
Fix her case, you never heard of me,

57:28.710 --> 57:29.790
she'll tell all.

57:32.871 --> 57:33.630
I'm listening.

57:36.630 --> 57:37.710
There were two men.

57:39.591 --> 57:42.911
One fired,
the other waited in the car.

57:45.751 --> 57:48.752
I saw the one in the car today.

57:50.792 --> 57:51.912
Where did you see him?

57:53.592 --> 57:55.111
At Police HQ.

57:55.632 --> 57:56.992
He's a cop.

58:07.232 --> 58:08.353
What do you want?

58:08.513 --> 58:09.952
Issued by Judge Rousseau,

58:10.553 --> 58:14.833
instructions to search your home
and take you in for questioning.

58:14.992 --> 58:15.593
You crazy?

58:16.193 --> 58:17.913
You'd better let us in.

58:18.393 --> 58:19.634
Go fuck yourself!

58:19.793 --> 58:21.233
You got fucked, Vrinks.

58:41.474 --> 58:43.515
Search the whole place.

58:43.674 --> 58:44.435
Leo,

58:45.275 --> 58:46.274
what's happening?

58:46.995 --> 58:48.355
Who is this?

58:48.955 --> 58:50.035
It's nothing. Stay with Lola.

58:50.595 --> 58:52.115
- Who's Lola?
- My daughter.

58:52.795 --> 58:53.475
Who are you?

58:53.916 --> 58:54.955
Internal Affairs.
Don't worry.

58:56.995 --> 58:58.396
Why are they arresting you?

58:58.556 --> 59:00.555
Later, Camille. Do what I said.

59:07.076 --> 59:08.756
Camille called.

59:10.397 --> 59:11.317
What did she want?

59:12.437 --> 59:13.557
What do you think?

59:18.317 --> 59:20.517
Was Leo's arrest your doing?

59:20.877 --> 59:23.157
It wasn't my doing.

59:23.317 --> 59:26.477
He was arrested for being dumb.
I did my job.

59:26.757 --> 59:28.397
Your job is jailing your friends?

59:28.638 --> 59:31.198
When they cross the line, yes.

59:33.238 --> 59:35.558
You won't fulfill yourself that way.

59:37.398 --> 59:38.198
Meaning?

59:41.438 --> 59:44.478
Becoming the fine cop
you'll never be.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.679
Why didn't you tell me?

01:00:06.399 --> 01:00:07.960
What for?

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.960
We nailed Horn and his gang.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.200
The rest is a detail.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.280
It could jail you for 10 years.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.360
You covered up a murder.
You don't realize.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.561
No.

01:00:22.241 --> 01:00:24.641
I got screwed by my informant,
not the same.

01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:28.681
I owed him for his tip.
You'd have done the same.

01:00:30.881 --> 01:00:32.002
I'm not you.

01:00:35.241 --> 01:00:36.242
What should I do?

01:00:36.961 --> 01:00:39.522
Come clean:
don't crap lnternal Affairs.

01:00:39.962 --> 01:00:42.642
The hooker recognized you and Silien.

01:00:43.242 --> 01:00:45.282
Denial makes you an accomplice.

01:00:46.162 --> 01:00:48.323
I gotta snitch on Silien?

01:00:48.482 --> 01:00:51.603
He put you in deep shit.
Tell us where he is.

01:00:51.843 --> 01:00:55.362
- It's your only chance.
- I don't know where he is.

01:01:04.883 --> 01:01:07.484
Judge Rousseau
has been assigned to the case.

01:01:10.484 --> 01:01:11.444
You know him.

01:01:13.484 --> 01:01:16.444
He hates cops, he'll slaughter you.

01:01:20.604 --> 01:01:22.284
...Closing a blind eye

01:01:22.444 --> 01:01:25.404
on 3 murders to protect an informant

01:01:25.564 --> 01:01:27.805
and arrest a vicious gang is one thing.

01:01:28.605 --> 01:01:31.205
That this led to a colleague's death,

01:01:31.365 --> 01:01:33.724
and the events that ensued,
is another.

01:01:34.885 --> 01:01:36.645
What is serious, Vrinks,

01:01:37.405 --> 01:01:41.646
is that your silence
meant Silien was freed.

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:44.926
He's a menace to society.

01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:50.926
I won't dwell on the ethics
of policemen and informants.

01:01:51.926 --> 01:01:53.726
We both know it's open

01:01:53.886 --> 01:01:56.767
to personal interpretation,

01:01:57.287 --> 01:02:00.047
and rests on fuzzy rules and controls.

01:02:02.247 --> 01:02:05.527
But there's a principle
all police officers must obey:

01:02:06.646 --> 01:02:10.407
never to guarantee impunity
to an informant,

01:02:12.007 --> 01:02:14.247
or take the place of justice,

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:17.448
whatever the goals.

01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:18.528
See you soon, boss!

01:02:20.927 --> 01:02:23.968
That's why I'm ordering
your incarceration.

01:03:09.971 --> 01:03:13.931
Dennis Klein,
badge number 628049.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:17.691
You appeared
before this board to answer

01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.291
on your responsibility
in the death of Lt. Eddy Valence

01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:24.092
during a police operation
on Glarner St,

01:03:24.252 --> 01:03:26.891
in St Ouen, last January 1 2th.

01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:30.852
Seeing the findings
of the lnternal Affairs Division,

01:03:31.012 --> 01:03:32.732
by Chief lnspector Staneck,

01:03:33.372 --> 01:03:35.292
and the statement by Lt. Jenner

01:03:35.572 --> 01:03:39.412
confirming
that you acted in self-defense,

01:03:40.452 --> 01:03:42.252
as the man Francis Horn had

01:03:42.412 --> 01:03:44.653
"spontaneously opened fire,

01:03:44.813 --> 01:03:47.893
"while you were
on a reconnaissance mission."

01:03:48.253 --> 01:03:51.653
Seeing that Capt. Vrinks's statement

01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:54.134
was held to be inadmissible

01:03:54.294 --> 01:03:56.734
due to his present situation,

01:03:56.894 --> 01:03:58.654
and his closeness to the victim,

01:03:58.814 --> 01:04:02.694
this board clears you
of all responsibility

01:04:02.854 --> 01:04:04.694
in this tragic matter.

01:04:04.854 --> 01:04:05.814
Hence,

01:04:06.694 --> 01:04:08.054
all charges are dropped,

01:04:09.255 --> 01:04:11.415
nothing will appear

01:04:11.575 --> 01:04:13.895
in your file.

01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:30.255
Among criminals,

01:04:30.415 --> 01:04:32.896
guys like you end up on a vacant lot,

01:04:33.856 --> 01:04:35.256
with 3 slugs in their head.

01:04:37.696 --> 01:04:41.737
Among criminals, guys like me
don't listen to guys like you.

01:05:03.577 --> 01:05:05.538
When'll Dad be back?

01:05:07.417 --> 01:05:08.538
Soon.

01:05:09.778 --> 01:05:11.458
But he hasn't left us?

01:05:12.698 --> 01:05:14.379
Why do you say that?

01:05:15.698 --> 01:05:17.779
Because you're sad.

01:05:18.059 --> 01:05:21.258
Usually when he's away,
you're not sad.

01:05:24.059 --> 01:05:26.939
Usually, he doesn't go so far away.

01:05:51.941 --> 01:05:52.621
Your Honor,

01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:55.821
I'm Captain Vrinks's wife.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.501
My husband has been
jailed for almost 3 weeks.

01:05:59.661 --> 01:06:01.861
I'm still not allowed to see him.

01:06:02.461 --> 01:06:03.421
My little girl

01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:06.381
asks for news
of her dad every night.

01:06:07.022 --> 01:06:07.661
Why do this?

01:06:08.221 --> 01:06:11.782
You could issue me
a visiting permit now.

01:06:12.701 --> 01:06:14.262
I have a lunch date.

01:06:14.662 --> 01:06:15.822
Excuse me.

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:34.023
Who is this?

01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:36.663
I want to help you.

01:06:37.463 --> 01:06:38.423
Help me do what?

01:06:38.903 --> 01:06:41.663
I can't say on the phone.
Can we meet?

01:06:42.144 --> 01:06:43.423
I'll call later.

01:06:48.344 --> 01:06:50.104
I can't say on the phone.

01:06:50.584 --> 01:06:51.304
It's him.

01:06:51.464 --> 01:06:52.304
I'll call later.

01:06:52.464 --> 01:06:53.704
It's his voice.

01:06:53.984 --> 01:06:57.464
Tap her phone day and night.
Don't miss his call.

01:06:57.625 --> 01:07:01.225
When you've zeroed in on Silien,
advise me. Only me!

01:07:04.824 --> 01:07:06.425
Hello, Camille.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.465
Got time for a coffee?

01:07:11.545 --> 01:07:12.985
What do you want?

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:17.985
To say I'm sorry
for what happened.

01:07:18.545 --> 01:07:20.106
I didn't want this.

01:07:21.226 --> 01:07:23.026
If you need anything...

01:07:23.866 --> 01:07:25.666
I don't need you, Dennis.

01:07:26.306 --> 01:07:28.266
I haven't for ages.

01:07:30.666 --> 01:07:31.986
Is that all?

01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:33.947
No...

01:07:55.228 --> 01:07:56.588
That won't be necessary.

01:07:57.628 --> 01:08:01.148
One question, Mr Vrinks:
the same one.

01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:03.588
Where's your friend Hugo Silien?

01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:05.308
My answer hasn't changed.

01:08:06.189 --> 01:08:07.589
You can take him back.

01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:11.389
Why treat me this way?

01:08:11.748 --> 01:08:13.589
It's how I treat people here.

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:16.390
I'm not like them.
I'm a cop.

01:08:16.908 --> 01:08:18.189
You're nothing now.

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:23.029
Handcuffs! Don't move!

01:08:26.429 --> 01:08:27.149
The other one.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:31.229
Don't worsen things.

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:33.750
Cuff yourselves
to the radiator! Fast!

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:34.790
Don't move, asshole!

01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:36.710
Hurry!

01:09:05.551 --> 01:09:06.993
Why did you do it?

01:09:08.112 --> 01:09:09.232
To see you.

01:09:10.471 --> 01:09:12.313
Now what'll they do?

01:09:14.992 --> 01:09:17.553
Put me in the corner,
till it blows over.

01:09:18.313 --> 01:09:19.993
Then I'll be let back in.

01:09:21.832 --> 01:09:24.154
- When?
- Soon.

01:09:27.193 --> 01:09:27.953
Hold out!

01:09:29.913 --> 01:09:31.872
If you can outside,
I can inside.

01:09:32.834 --> 01:09:34.354
They can't keep me for long.

01:09:36.194 --> 01:09:37.953
Why didn't you tell me?

01:09:38.113 --> 01:09:40.595
So they couldn't question you.

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:44.913
How's Lola?

01:09:45.635 --> 01:09:46.475
She misses you.

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:51.274
What did you tell her?

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:54.715
The truth.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:10:00.635
Dennis came to see me at work.

01:10:03.076 --> 01:10:03.795
What for?

01:10:04.036 --> 01:10:08.396
He wanted to know
if I knew a man called Silien.

01:10:10.596 --> 01:10:11.956
What did you say?

01:10:12.476 --> 01:10:13.676
Nothing.

01:10:14.956 --> 01:10:15.957
I said nothing.

01:10:16.117 --> 01:10:18.196
- Has he tried to reach you?
- Who?

01:10:18.356 --> 01:10:19.357
Silien. Has he?

01:10:21.557 --> 01:10:23.077
Answer, Camille.

01:10:23.477 --> 01:10:24.677
No one called.

01:10:24.837 --> 01:10:26.277
Stay away, he's bad news.

01:10:27.037 --> 01:10:28.317
You promise?

01:10:30.238 --> 01:10:31.637
I promise.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:34.598
I love you.

01:10:43.438 --> 01:10:44.918
I love you, too.

01:10:45.598 --> 01:10:46.918
Kiss Lola.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.960
We can go now.

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:40.401
Let me welcome here

01:11:40.561 --> 01:11:43.762
our new Police Chief,
Mr Robert Mancini.

01:11:45.002 --> 01:11:47.802
And introduce you
to the man who succeeds him

01:11:48.122 --> 01:11:51.402
as the new head of the ClD.

01:11:52.362 --> 01:11:55.482
Captain Dennis Klein.

01:11:58.163 --> 01:12:00.083
Let's wish them both good luck.

01:12:06.563 --> 01:12:07.443
To the new head!

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:11.123
What are you after?

01:12:11.923 --> 01:12:13.244
Nothing...

01:12:14.604 --> 01:12:16.884
I came to watch you, to learn.

01:12:21.044 --> 01:12:22.524
Thinking of him?

01:12:22.684 --> 01:12:23.644
Should l?

01:12:27.084 --> 01:12:29.604
I thought cops were special,

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.804
above bad things.

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:35.165
Why should we be?
Give me a good reason.

01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:37.205
We're paid to be better.

01:12:37.404 --> 01:12:38.805
My respects, Chief.

01:12:41.885 --> 01:12:43.686
Throw the fucker out!

01:12:43.925 --> 01:12:45.445
Put him in the drunk tank.

01:12:47.926 --> 01:12:48.886
Let go!

01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:50.845
I know the way out!

01:12:51.005 --> 01:12:53.526
He'll resign once he's sober!

01:12:56.766 --> 01:13:00.167
Under me, you'd better
lose your bad habits!

01:13:11.567 --> 01:13:14.207
This is Captain Klein's number.

01:13:14.367 --> 01:13:16.567
Leave a message after the beep.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:20.688
Boss, it's Jenner. Are you in?

01:13:21.288 --> 01:13:25.168
We tapped Silien calling her again.
They're meeting at...

01:13:25.448 --> 01:13:26.367
I'm listening.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.770
Subject got in.

01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:08.051
They're on Rte 20, freeway bound.

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:13.290
Zebra 4 stay put,
let them come to you.

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:16.531
3 and 5 stay behind.
We'll nab 'em by the freeway.

01:14:16.891 --> 01:14:18.731
Think of her, it's risky.

01:14:21.411 --> 01:14:22.131
Drive.

01:14:33.092 --> 01:14:34.852
There's 20 grand for you.

01:14:35.732 --> 01:14:37.212
You and your daughter.

01:14:37.972 --> 01:14:39.652
Until Leo's out.

01:14:40.732 --> 01:14:42.292
I should say thanks.

01:14:43.253 --> 01:14:45.932
My letter explains things.
I can't do more.

01:14:46.092 --> 01:14:47.413
If they nab me, I'll get life.

01:14:47.572 --> 01:14:49.653
How long's Leo in for?

01:14:50.093 --> 01:14:52.813
Those are the rules.
He took a gamble and lost.

01:14:53.413 --> 01:14:55.733
Damn that.
What can you do for him?

01:14:57.453 --> 01:14:58.453
Nothing.

01:15:01.254 --> 01:15:02.253
What's this?

01:15:02.454 --> 01:15:03.694
You snitched!

01:15:03.893 --> 01:15:05.454
Turn! Stop!

01:15:15.854 --> 01:15:17.894
They're headed for you now.

01:15:25.495 --> 01:15:26.975
- Don't let her by!
- I must!

01:15:27.175 --> 01:15:28.535
Don't let her by! Dammit!

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.538
I hear you want a transfer.

01:16:25.179 --> 01:16:25.979
Too bad.

01:16:26.979 --> 01:16:30.859
I'd put up your name
for promotion to Captain.

01:16:32.139 --> 01:16:33.539
Like the others?

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:36.539
They saw it was a smart move.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.580
I'm not made for your clan.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.540
I'm a plain cop,
no dumber than others.

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:45.659
I'm fine as I am.

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.860
Then why didn't you speak up?

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:57.141
Vrinks jailed, his wife dead,
you as boss, suits 'em all.

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.900
Why should I blab?

01:17:02.181 --> 01:17:05.901
One day the ghosts
will come and take you away.

01:17:07.221 --> 01:17:08.781
You'll have to answer

01:17:08.942 --> 01:17:10.141
for your dirty tricks.

01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:16.302
Some day,
we all have to die...

01:18:06.744 --> 01:18:07.785
We have to go.

01:18:08.745 --> 01:18:09.505
Sorry.

01:18:10.865 --> 01:18:13.425
I want to kiss my daughter.
Not cuffed.

01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:15.785
I can't. It's the rule.

01:18:18.705 --> 01:18:20.745
I'll handle it.

01:18:25.146 --> 01:18:27.226
No one knows why Silien shot her.

01:18:40.227 --> 01:18:41.627
Bye, darling.

01:18:42.867 --> 01:18:45.587
I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

01:18:46.547 --> 01:18:47.747
You going back to jail?

01:18:47.907 --> 01:18:50.787
Yes, I'll write you every day.

01:18:50.947 --> 01:18:54.228
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- I'm not.

01:18:56.907 --> 01:18:58.668
Granpa's there.

01:18:59.308 --> 01:19:00.308
I love you, darling.

01:19:04.029 --> 01:19:05.828
I love you, too.

01:20:47.234 --> 01:20:50.395
Captain Vrinks released from jail...

01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:53.595
Turn it up.

01:20:53.754 --> 01:20:56.195
...for complicity
to 2nd degree murder,

01:20:56.354 --> 01:20:59.235
the former BRl chief
was freed for good conduct

01:20:59.395 --> 01:21:01.155
after serving 7 years.

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:05.355
A reminder, too,
of his wife's tragic death

01:21:05.516 --> 01:21:09.476
during the arrest of Hugo Silien,
alleged killer of Marcus Zerbib...

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.760
Come in!

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.600
He's at the home of

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.240
a former hooker, Manou Berliner,

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.240
in the 1 6th district.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:29.161
Check it out
and stay on his ass.

01:22:29.561 --> 01:22:32.041
I want all his moves
and who he sees.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.601
What are you waiting for?

01:22:36.361 --> 01:22:39.681
I ran you a bath,
then I'll go shopping.

01:22:39.841 --> 01:22:40.881
I'll be off, too.

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:44.802
Don't you move.
Stay here and rest.

01:22:46.482 --> 01:22:48.721
It's weird to have you here.

01:22:50.122 --> 01:22:52.682
- I won't bother you long.
- You're no bother.

01:22:54.082 --> 01:22:54.882
On the contrary.

01:22:56.642 --> 01:22:59.562
Christo'll turn in his grave!

01:22:59.722 --> 01:23:01.082
A cop in his bathtub!

01:23:03.522 --> 01:23:05.883
At the end, he was unrecognizable.

01:23:06.923 --> 01:23:08.603
He barely weighed 80 lbs.

01:23:12.203 --> 01:23:15.004
His car's still in the garage.
You can use it.

01:23:16.163 --> 01:23:17.403
For anything else,

01:23:17.763 --> 01:23:20.923
you know this place,
feel at home.

01:23:51.405 --> 01:23:54.125
- What's it about?
- I'm here to see Titi Brasseur.

01:23:54.525 --> 01:23:56.725
- Who are you?
- Leo Vrinks.

01:24:08.526 --> 01:24:09.287
He's OK!

01:24:09.687 --> 01:24:13.287
It's not classy, but there's free
booze and lots of ass.

01:24:14.647 --> 01:24:15.926
Still see the old bunch?

01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:18.807
Not a one.

01:24:21.767 --> 01:24:23.448
What'll you do now?

01:24:27.207 --> 01:24:28.007
No idea.

01:24:37.569 --> 01:24:40.008
Besides Klein,
who saw Camille's death?

01:24:43.169 --> 01:24:44.448
No one knows.

01:24:44.809 --> 01:24:47.488
No one talked,
it was all hushed up.

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:50.129
Those who didn't blab
got promoted.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:54.570
Only the Verhagen chick
got left behind.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:55.889
Where's she now?

01:24:57.249 --> 01:24:59.009
Cop shop in the sticks.

01:24:59.729 --> 01:25:01.049
On the complaints desk.

01:25:02.409 --> 01:25:03.410
In Gennevilliers.

01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:12.531
I'll be off.

01:25:14.731 --> 01:25:16.211
Too crowded, too noisy.

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:19.051
I'm out of practice.

01:25:34.452 --> 01:25:36.571
- I'm sorry.
- You creep!

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:39.012
- Apologize to my wife.
- He didn't.

01:25:39.171 --> 01:25:41.532
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't!

01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:43.292
Who are you shitting?

01:25:51.893 --> 01:25:54.493
Lay off him! Asshole!

01:25:57.132 --> 01:25:58.253
Don't touch me!

01:25:58.413 --> 01:25:59.573
You're a goner!

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:11.734
Sorry.

01:26:11.894 --> 01:26:13.094
You know him?

01:26:13.374 --> 01:26:14.294
No, why?

01:26:18.534 --> 01:26:20.855
We've seen that creep before.

01:26:21.454 --> 01:26:22.534
I'm sure of it.

01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:25.775
Take good care.

01:26:53.217 --> 01:26:54.656
Don't let her by!

01:26:59.897 --> 01:27:02.016
No one knows why Silien shot her!

01:27:04.057 --> 01:27:05.897
We heard a shot, the car skidded,

01:27:06.137 --> 01:27:06.977
he shot at us,

01:27:07.657 --> 01:27:08.777
we fired back.

01:27:11.018 --> 01:27:12.378
I only want one version.

01:27:25.299 --> 01:27:26.898
You knew about Camille?

01:27:32.019 --> 01:27:33.298
What could I do?

01:27:39.179 --> 01:27:40.419
Leo, wait!

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.180
That's him.

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:03.261
- Up already?
- I couldn't sleep.

01:28:07.821 --> 01:28:10.141
There's cops parked below.

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.261
I saw them.

01:28:12.781 --> 01:28:13.821
Why are they there?

01:28:14.101 --> 01:28:16.221
They were told to be there.

01:28:17.662 --> 01:28:19.821
Policemen's Ball at City Hall

01:28:23.382 --> 01:28:24.301
I need a gun.

01:28:31.742 --> 01:28:32.623
By when?

01:28:35.383 --> 01:28:36.743
By Friday.

01:29:28.345 --> 01:29:29.546
Took you long enough.

01:29:50.747 --> 01:29:52.748
When did you get out?

01:29:53.267 --> 01:29:54.668
2 days ago.

01:29:55.827 --> 01:29:58.547
You waited 2 days
before coming to see me?

01:29:58.707 --> 01:30:00.347
I waited...

01:30:02.068 --> 01:30:03.988
for the right moment.

01:30:05.268 --> 01:30:08.108
It's hard to return to the living.

01:30:12.548 --> 01:30:14.269
Some day, explain it to me.

01:30:15.909 --> 01:30:17.348
Some day...

01:30:20.029 --> 01:30:22.709
Why didn't you let me visit you in jail?

01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:31.270
I was afraid.

01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.989
Of what?

01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:38.310
Watching you leave each time.

01:31:25.632 --> 01:31:26.793
Call me tomorrow?

01:31:27.553 --> 01:31:28.673
I promise.

01:31:30.513 --> 01:31:31.713
Lola...

01:31:35.474 --> 01:31:37.833
That story isn't quite over.

01:31:39.353 --> 01:31:41.153
There's a last thing to settle.

01:31:42.154 --> 01:31:43.554
Then I'll have to leave.

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:46.194
Where to?

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:48.314
I don't know. Far away.

01:31:49.834 --> 01:31:51.394
Don't dump me twice.

01:32:11.075 --> 01:32:13.515
Night. See you Saturday.

01:32:28.316 --> 01:32:30.197
Who are those assholes?

01:32:54.158 --> 01:32:54.918
War booty.

01:32:55.078 --> 01:32:57.438
Fuck, that's Bruno's shiv!

01:33:01.638 --> 01:33:03.678
Were you on that junket?

01:33:06.119 --> 01:33:09.079
Answer, who else was along?

01:33:09.559 --> 01:33:10.679
Who was with you?

01:33:11.839 --> 01:33:14.119
Who's that?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.439
That's a cop...

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.400
Your friend is brain-dead.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.201
He'll stay that way
till he's unplugged.

01:33:42.401 --> 01:33:45.961
Shit, what ya doin'?

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:48.841
Who the fuck are you?
What have I done?

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.202
Lt. Eve Verhagen, please.

01:33:53.321 --> 01:33:56.442
It's Vrinks. I'm at Evry hospital.

01:33:57.562 --> 01:33:59.682
Titi got beat up, he's in a coma.

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:01.642
For good.

01:34:03.962 --> 01:34:06.043
Care to know who did it?

01:34:44.685 --> 01:34:45.965
Don't go, Leo.

01:34:48.044 --> 01:34:49.765
It's the only thing to do.

01:34:54.925 --> 01:34:56.285
Call you when it's done.

01:35:07.206 --> 01:35:08.686
What's he up to?

01:35:14.566 --> 01:35:16.166
Badges and guns on the dash.

01:35:20.927 --> 01:35:21.967
Get out.

01:35:28.687 --> 01:35:29.887
In the trunk.

01:35:31.447 --> 01:35:32.087
Get in.

01:35:32.247 --> 01:35:33.848
This is dumb, Vrinks.

01:35:34.208 --> 01:35:37.048
Get in. Hurry!

01:36:37.572 --> 01:36:41.572
Good evening.
Thank you for coming so numerous

01:36:42.732 --> 01:36:45.492
to this very special event
that honors

01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:48.812
all of you, who through
your generosity...

01:37:45.015 --> 01:37:46.416
Congratulations, Klein.

01:38:05.857 --> 01:38:07.777
Only the dead don't return.

01:38:11.177 --> 01:38:12.697
Don't look around.

01:38:13.857 --> 01:38:16.498
So you see your face
explode in the mirror.

01:38:21.138 --> 01:38:23.058
How could you have shot her?

01:38:27.538 --> 01:38:29.418
I could've forgotten everything.

01:38:30.018 --> 01:38:31.458
But not that.

01:38:31.658 --> 01:38:33.099
Don't let her by!

01:38:33.458 --> 01:38:35.178
Don't let her by, dammit!

01:38:40.619 --> 01:38:42.619
She was already dead.

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:49.140
No one knows why Silien shot her.

01:39:08.621 --> 01:39:10.941
If you miss yourself with the first,

01:39:12.381 --> 01:39:14.581
there's 1 3 more in the clip.

01:40:03.184 --> 01:40:04.024
Fuck you!

01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:06.784
You hear me, Vrinks!

01:40:07.904 --> 01:40:09.344
Go fuck yourself!

01:40:10.024 --> 01:40:12.584
You hear? She died

01:40:12.864 --> 01:40:16.105
because of you!
Only because of you!

01:40:16.785 --> 01:40:19.025
You're the one who fucked up!

01:40:21.025 --> 01:40:23.625
If you'd left us alone

01:40:23.786 --> 01:40:25.705
it never would've happened!

01:40:28.146 --> 01:40:29.145
You hear me,

01:40:29.546 --> 01:40:30.945
you dirty fucker!

01:40:31.385 --> 01:40:32.506
You hear?

01:40:32.666 --> 01:40:33.386
Klein?

01:40:33.545 --> 01:40:35.465
- What?
- Remember me?

01:40:49.107 --> 01:40:51.187
Who else was there?

01:40:53.227 --> 01:40:54.387
Klein.

01:41:26.429 --> 01:41:29.149
Top Cop Gunned Down In Central Paris

01:41:29.429 --> 01:41:30.909
Want the paper, too?

01:41:39.509 --> 01:41:41.670
No, just the candy.

01:41:57.711 --> 01:42:03.581
