04:08.825 --> 04:11.157
We are currently on a family trip.

04:11.294 --> 04:14.195
If you need to reach us,
please call tomorrow.

04:14.331 --> 04:16.128
Be happy!

07:42.138 --> 07:43.628
Open the door.

07:44.140 --> 07:46.199
You have the keys!

08:06.729 --> 08:10.460
You wanted to go on a trip so badly.
What's wrong now?

08:10.767 --> 08:13.133
You call that a trip?
It was hell.

08:17.273 --> 08:18.968
Get rid of that right now!

08:25.315 --> 08:28.250
Shoot me. Shoot me.
Please make my day.

09:58.341 --> 10:00.536
Why aren't you picking up?

10:00.677 --> 10:02.406
Are you still angry at me?

10:03.780 --> 10:06.578
I'm sorry.
Hurry and pick up.

10:09.018 --> 10:11.418
I've done everything for you!
What are you unsatisfied with?

10:11.588 --> 10:13.146
You are driving me nuts!

10:14.157 --> 10:15.852
Pick up the phone!

10:16.426 --> 10:17.757
Damn it!

14:57.406 --> 14:59.067
Pick up the phone now!

15:00.843 --> 15:02.504
You want to see me
go crazy again?

15:04.914 --> 15:06.404
I want to talk, so pick up!

15:09.986 --> 15:12.079
If you don't answer the phone,
I will go home right now.

18:55.778 --> 18:58.872
What are you doing
with all the doors open?

18:59.482 --> 19:02.542
And can't you answer the phone?

19:02.918 --> 19:05.113
I couldn't get any work done
on my business trip!

19:05.888 --> 19:08.789
Why are you ignoring me?
Do I look that foolish to you?

19:09.225 --> 19:10.715
Am I your slave?

19:13.496 --> 19:15.020
What do I need to do?

19:15.164 --> 19:17.064
Think it's easy to live this well?

19:18.067 --> 19:20.035
I told you not to wear this!

19:20.469 --> 19:22.801
Why do you keep doing
the things I hate?

19:31.247 --> 19:32.612
I'm sorry.

19:33.382 --> 19:34.815
I'm sorry.

19:35.851 --> 19:38.251
I don't know why I act this way.

19:38.954 --> 19:41.548
I love you.

19:43.659 --> 19:45.559
Please make me happy.

19:52.802 --> 19:55.737
Why? Why do you make
me feel so wretched?

19:56.071 --> 19:58.005
For once let me do as I want to!

19:58.841 --> 20:02.038
Think I'll devour you?
Am I some insect?

20:02.178 --> 20:06.308
Just please hold still. Please.

20:28.437 --> 20:29.995
What the hell?

20:30.105 --> 20:31.834
Who's playing golf in my yard?

20:39.481 --> 20:41.108
How'd you get in here?

20:45.087 --> 20:47.146
Hello? Is this the police?

20:47.690 --> 20:49.658
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

20:57.266 --> 20:59.996
Hello? My house is...

24:44.493 --> 24:46.427
Hi, this is Oak Jin-gon.

24:46.762 --> 24:48.889
I'm abroad right now
for a photo shoot.

24:49.064 --> 24:53.023
If you need to reach me,
please call 011-342-3464.

24:53.569 --> 24:54.627
Thanks.

31:45.280 --> 31:49.148
Hi, you've reached the home
of Ji-eun and Hyun-soo.

31:49.251 --> 31:53.051
We're in Hawaii now
for our three year anniversary

31:53.855 --> 31:57.985
If you have something to say,
please leave a message after the beep

35:44.052 --> 35:45.212
What the hell's this?

36:01.636 --> 36:03.126
See if they've taken anything.

36:17.318 --> 36:19.218
Honey! Honey!

36:19.320 --> 36:21.049
Who the hell are you?

36:21.156 --> 36:23.624
What are you drunk idiots
doing in my home?

36:24.192 --> 36:26.353
And why are you two
wearing our pajamas?

36:26.961 --> 36:28.394
- Anything stolen?
- No.

36:29.063 --> 36:31.190
If you're not thieves,
then what are you?

38:21.709 --> 38:23.540
Mi-young, open your eyes!

38:24.579 --> 38:25.841
Mi-young!

38:26.381 --> 38:28.178
Mi-young, wake up!

38:28.549 --> 38:29.743
Mi-young!

38:30.518 --> 38:32.179
Mi-young, are you alright?

38:32.887 --> 38:34.184
Mi-young!

38:35.423 --> 38:37.220
Mi-young, wake up!

38:37.325 --> 38:40.021
Wake up! Mi-young!

38:41.162 --> 38:43.289
Mi-young! Mi-young!

38:44.465 --> 38:46.433
Mi-young, wake up!

38:46.935 --> 38:49.301
Please open your eyes!

44:45.226 --> 44:47.592
We are off to Jeju Island!

44:47.828 --> 44:50.490
If you need to contact us
please call back in three days!

44:50.598 --> 44:51.963
Be happy!

46:04.939 --> 46:07.134
Dad, did you call?

46:07.808 --> 46:09.241
Are you okay, dad?

46:10.077 --> 46:11.339
Hello?

46:11.579 --> 46:12.568
Hello...

47:01.629 --> 47:03.062
Dad!

47:05.933 --> 47:06.957
Father!

47:12.606 --> 47:13.834
Who are you people?

47:14.375 --> 47:16.275
What are you doing
in my father's home?

47:16.544 --> 47:18.341
Where's father?

47:20.815 --> 47:22.749
- Father!
- Father!

47:23.551 --> 47:25.576
- He's not here.
- What?

47:26.287 --> 47:28.346
You two.
Stay where you are.

47:28.756 --> 47:30.018
Come outside.

47:35.529 --> 47:37.588
Hello? This is the police, right?

47:37.798 --> 47:40.961
Yes, I have a situation here.
Please come quickly.

47:52.413 --> 47:53.641
What did you do to the old man?

47:54.949 --> 47:56.382
Sweetheart, you tell me.

47:56.917 --> 47:58.111
You killed him, right?

48:01.222 --> 48:02.348
What's this?

48:06.393 --> 48:10.022
I see you've broken into
many other homes.

48:10.531 --> 48:12.999
So you took pictures
as if it was your own home.

48:15.936 --> 48:18.530
Officer Lee, see if their owners
reported a burglary.

48:18.606 --> 48:19.937
Yes, sir.

48:21.008 --> 48:24.034
You two. What did you steal
from all these homes?

48:28.215 --> 48:30.115
This punk needs to learn a lesson.

48:32.453 --> 48:33.750
Take the woman outside.

49:31.745 --> 49:33.474
Sorry to keep you waiting.

49:34.848 --> 49:36.713
He buried him secretly
near his apartment.

49:37.184 --> 49:38.446
What?

49:38.686 --> 49:40.051
- Officer Lee!
- Yes, sir!

49:40.754 --> 49:43.188
Take the CIS team
to his father's apartment.

49:55.636 --> 49:57.297
Open the lid.

50:06.513 --> 50:07.605
Father...

50:08.882 --> 50:10.110
Father!

50:10.784 --> 50:12.809
Doesn't look like
he was buried in secret

50:12.920 --> 50:14.182
Father.

50:18.092 --> 50:23.621
Missing Person Report

50:26.433 --> 50:27.764
This is you, isn't it?

50:49.690 --> 50:50.918
Yes?

50:52.092 --> 50:53.616
Yes, I understand.

50:59.700 --> 51:02.100
Illegal entry. Murder.

51:02.970 --> 51:05.461
Abandoning a dead body.
Kidnapping.

51:07.508 --> 51:09.976
If you have any others,
tell me now.

51:11.078 --> 51:12.375
What did you do to that woman?

51:13.247 --> 51:14.874
What did you do to her
to keep her so silent?

51:20.220 --> 51:21.710
Sir, he's clean.

51:23.524 --> 51:26.925
Also, I called some of the houses
he shot with the camera,

51:27.895 --> 51:29.624
and they said nothing was stolen

51:30.397 --> 51:31.523
Really?

51:32.933 --> 51:34.924
- Bring her husband when he comes.
- Yes, sir.

51:44.011 --> 51:46.809
You even have a college degree.
So why'd you break into their homes?

51:47.281 --> 51:48.407
Sir, he's here.

51:49.283 --> 51:50.545
Tell him to come in.

51:57.991 --> 51:59.856
Lee Min-kyu, right?

52:00.227 --> 52:01.353
Yes.

52:02.896 --> 52:04.158
She's all yours.

52:14.942 --> 52:16.432
Son of a bitch!

52:19.446 --> 52:20.504
Stop it!

52:20.614 --> 52:23.082
Let go!
I'm gonna kill that bastard!

52:24.284 --> 52:25.615
Let's go.

52:30.124 --> 52:31.284
Sir!

52:31.992 --> 52:33.721
The autopsy results
have come out.

52:35.195 --> 52:37.322
It's not murder, it's lung cancer.

52:38.098 --> 52:40.259
What? Lung cancer?

52:40.768 --> 52:43.532
- Are they sure?
- Yes, I understand.

52:43.871 --> 52:48.308
He was delicately shrouded.
Apart from a real ceremony,

52:48.709 --> 52:51.371
he buried his body
better than any son could.

52:54.181 --> 52:57.082
He doesn't seem
like a bad person to me.

52:58.719 --> 53:01.017
- Wait outside.
- Yes, sir.

53:14.201 --> 53:15.725
Well, you're free from
the homicide charge.

53:16.770 --> 53:18.237
So how was she?

53:18.906 --> 53:20.498
You liked forcing her, right?

53:23.677 --> 53:24.905
What are you looking at?

53:29.516 --> 53:30.813
Don't smile.

53:49.336 --> 53:51.497
Your favorite plant over there...

53:51.839 --> 53:54.831
I knew you'd come back
so I took good care of it.

53:55.709 --> 53:57.677
It looks healthy, doesn't it?

54:00.681 --> 54:03.514
I've thought things out
and I'd been too much.

54:05.519 --> 54:07.384
I'll be good from now on.

54:10.757 --> 54:15.251
Okay, I won't if
you don't want me to.

54:16.897 --> 54:19.229
I've changed, you see?

54:20.534 --> 54:25.198
Oh yeah, while you were gone,
I sent plenty of money to your folks

54:58.739 --> 55:02.869
If it's that hard to withstand,
then do what you like.

56:00.033 --> 56:02.126
Isn't he being too harsh?

56:40.040 --> 56:41.564
Smile again.

56:48.482 --> 56:50.074
Let go, you bastard!

56:54.087 --> 56:56.385
Son of a bitch!

57:45.772 --> 57:47.069
Sit down!

57:51.478 --> 57:53.241
Sit down!

59:23.870 --> 59:25.531
Prisoner 2904!

59:31.378 --> 59:35.337
Playing games with me, you punk?
You scared me!

59:35.448 --> 59:37.177
Try that again.

59:37.350 --> 59:38.942
Today, you go hungry.

01:00:21.261 --> 01:00:23.195
Don't pretend you're sleeping.

01:00:25.999 --> 01:00:28.832
I've been thinking about us,
and I feel like a real dumb ass.

01:00:29.002 --> 01:00:30.970
Was I that bad to you?

01:00:31.771 --> 01:00:33.398
Tell me!

01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:40.009
I never wanted to ask this,
but I have to.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.605
What did he do to you?

01:00:44.618 --> 01:00:46.483
Did he do this?

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.755
He did this, but you stayed still?

01:00:49.923 --> 01:00:51.584
Like this?

01:00:52.525 --> 01:00:54.823
Like this? Like this?

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:18.909
Prisoner 2904!

01:01:19.419 --> 01:01:21.410
Prisoner 2904!

01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:35.529
You son of a bitch!

01:01:38.471 --> 01:01:40.769
Why do you keep hiding?

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.170
Wanna disappear
from the world altogether?

01:01:44.611 --> 01:01:47.842
If you pull that again,
I'll kill you.

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.258
Can I help you?

01:04:15.261 --> 01:04:17.058
Excuse me!

01:04:57.036 --> 01:04:59.800
- You're cleaning it again?
- Hi, honey.

01:05:03.176 --> 01:05:05.110
Who is she?

01:05:06.613 --> 01:05:08.342
I don't know.

01:05:12.218 --> 01:05:14.049
Let her sleep.

01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:59.098
Where have you been?

01:05:59.265 --> 01:06:01.460
I told you to call me
if you go out!

01:06:02.435 --> 01:06:04.369
Where have you been?

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:26.345
You're behind me, aren't you?

01:07:27.286 --> 01:07:29.880
The human eye sees
within the 180 degree angle.

01:07:30.223 --> 01:07:33.351
So you're hiding
in the other 180 degrees?

01:07:34.027 --> 01:07:36.086
But that's impossible!

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:39.996
You bastard!

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:47.933
You need more practice.
And take care of the shadow.

01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:51.306
And you'll have to calculate
the human mind, idiot!

01:07:51.544 --> 01:07:53.512
You crazy bastard.

01:07:53.913 --> 01:07:57.610
Even if you cover all that
what are you gonna do?

01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:08.551
Let's move out of here.
First thing tomorrow.

01:09:09.856 --> 01:09:13.019
You're waiting for him
to finish his sentence, aren't you?

01:09:13.826 --> 01:09:15.657
I'm right, aren't I?

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:24.764
A moving service please.
Hello?

01:09:25.238 --> 01:09:26.728
What's with you?

01:09:31.344 --> 01:09:33.368
Fine, then.

01:09:34.013 --> 01:09:36.106
Let's wait together for him.

01:09:36.448 --> 01:09:39.145
I dare you to come,
you son of a bitch.

01:09:40.653 --> 01:09:43.178
Prisoner 2904! Your meal!

01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:48.220
Prisoner 2904!

01:09:48.728 --> 01:09:52.390
When I go in this time,
I'll kill you for sure!

01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:05.109
You're behind me, aren't you?

01:10:05.645 --> 01:10:08.011
Trying to escape?

01:10:21.561 --> 01:10:23.256
Bastard...

01:10:23.396 --> 01:10:25.762
You think you can play with me now,
don't you?

01:10:35.474 --> 01:10:37.874
You fucking ghost.

01:10:50.122 --> 01:10:51.783
Come out!

01:11:17.116 --> 01:11:20.051
We have a laundry machine.
Why go through the trouble?

01:12:28.154 --> 01:12:29.678
Hello?

01:12:30.489 --> 01:12:32.252
The police?

01:12:33.292 --> 01:12:35.055
Yes, I understand.

01:12:36.963 --> 01:12:38.760
That bastard is out now.

01:12:42.735 --> 01:12:45.829
Son of a bitch,
I dare you to show up.

01:12:47.573 --> 01:12:49.165
Tell me.

01:12:50.876 --> 01:12:52.605
Tell me!

01:12:53.612 --> 01:12:56.274
Why'd you turn off your phone?

01:12:56.549 --> 01:12:59.541
- Know how many times I've called you?
- I told you!

01:12:59.618 --> 01:13:01.142
I told you many times!

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.611
My battery ran out.

01:13:05.224 --> 01:13:06.851
Rotten bastard.

01:13:07.193 --> 01:13:09.127
Think I'm that stupid?

01:13:09.628 --> 01:13:11.323
Who did you meet?

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:14.497
What the hell's wrong with you?
Are you mentally sick?

01:13:14.633 --> 01:13:16.624
You made me this way.

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:21.133
Who's the girl who always
calls late at night?

01:13:21.307 --> 01:13:23.275
Let's stop this.

01:13:25.411 --> 01:13:26.844
Did you just hear something?

01:13:26.946 --> 01:13:29.244
- What are you talking about?
- Hold on.

01:13:29.382 --> 01:13:31.316
I think someone's in the house.

01:13:31.417 --> 01:13:33.715
Who cares whether
someone's here or not.

01:13:34.387 --> 01:13:37.686
- I'm the idiot for trusting...
- No, I'm certain someone's in here.

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.256
- Don't play the psycho act with me.
- Hold on.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.019
Someone's here for sure.

01:13:53.639 --> 01:13:55.368
So who's here?

01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:57.068
I swear someone's here.

01:13:57.109 --> 01:13:59.737
I don't wanna hear it!
I don't trust you at all!

01:14:03.516 --> 01:14:05.381
You see?
I told you someone was here.

01:15:15.121 --> 01:15:17.681
Oh my goodness!
You scared me.

01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:20.418
I did? So how was your day?

01:15:20.526 --> 01:15:21.720
Good.

01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:26.425
Why didn't you tidy up the sofa?

01:15:26.899 --> 01:15:28.730
I did this morning.

01:15:29.535 --> 01:15:31.560
But why is it so messy?

01:15:31.937 --> 01:15:33.131
That's strange.

01:15:44.216 --> 01:15:45.513
Can't sleep?

01:15:47.319 --> 01:15:48.809
Want me to sing you a lullaby?

01:15:51.857 --> 01:15:53.882
I miss you, too.

01:15:56.328 --> 01:15:57.522
Wanna come over?

01:16:12.077 --> 01:16:13.408
Hey, it's weird.

01:16:14.914 --> 01:16:16.711
It feels like someone's in my place.

01:16:17.316 --> 01:16:18.544
Yeah.

01:16:19.218 --> 01:16:20.378
Then hurry up.

01:16:49.114 --> 01:16:50.581
So who's in your place?

01:16:50.849 --> 01:16:53.317
I didn't see anyone.
I just felt it.

01:16:53.752 --> 01:16:55.185
That's impossible.

01:16:56.255 --> 01:16:57.984
Am I just being too sensitive?

01:17:01.961 --> 01:17:04.521
- Isn't this your work?
- You haven't seen it yet?

01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:06.222
- Can I look at it?
- Yup.

01:17:11.804 --> 01:17:14.068
- Stop it.
- Come on.

01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:27.451
- I thought someone was here?
- Let him watch.

01:17:38.297 --> 01:17:40.663
- What's wrong?
- I think someone's watching

01:17:41.133 --> 01:17:42.657
I'm scared.

01:17:43.102 --> 01:17:45.832
You see? What did I tell you?

01:17:56.215 --> 01:17:57.147
What is it?

01:17:57.249 --> 01:17:59.581
Why'd you hang up an empty frame?
It's creepy.

01:19:08.153 --> 01:19:10.178
I think someone's here.

01:19:10.756 --> 01:19:12.155
Could it be him?

01:19:21.467 --> 01:19:23.526
He's bad luck,
that son of a bitch.

01:19:25.904 --> 01:19:28.737
Honey, stay still.

01:20:44.183 --> 01:20:47.175
What are you doing up?

01:20:51.557 --> 01:20:52.922
I love you.

01:20:53.759 --> 01:20:54.885
What?

01:21:03.068 --> 01:21:04.558
Honey...

01:21:55.053 --> 01:21:56.680
Breakfast is ready!

01:22:23.081 --> 01:22:25.948
What's made you so happy?
Stop smiling and eat.

01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:32.315
It's strange.

01:22:32.925 --> 01:22:35.086
It feels like someone's been here
since last night.

01:22:56.315 --> 01:22:58.215
What are you laughing for?

01:22:58.417 --> 01:22:59.782
Are you that happy?

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.658
Don't open the door
to just anybody.
