01:06.849 --> 01:08.416
Yeah, there you go.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.203
Move out back.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.163
Nah, you can't park there.

01:16.163 --> 01:18.817
<i>Mercer, all I can tell you is,</i>

01:18.817 --> 01:21.124
<i>it's not about
what anybody else does,</i>

01:21.124 --> 01:23.170
<i>it's about what you do.</i>

01:23.170 --> 01:26.086
<i>How you react, how you behave,</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:28.175
<i>and you know that's a decision</i>

01:28.175 --> 01:31.091
<i>that you're gonna
have to make every day.</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.919
<i>Conditional custody is
a good first step, all right?</i>

01:33.919 --> 01:35.051
<i>Be happy.</i>

01:35.051 --> 01:36.487
<i>I'll see you
at 8:00 a.m. Friday.</i>

01:37.358 --> 01:39.011
<i>Ready to piss in that cup.</i>

01:39.664 --> 01:40.665
Thank you.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.409
<i>It's dramatic</i>

01:45.409 --> 01:46.541
<i>and it's devastating</i>

01:46.541 --> 01:48.717
<i>to the Los Angeles
police officers</i>

01:48.717 --> 01:50.284
<i>involved in
the March 13 beating</i>

01:50.284 --> 01:51.937
<i>of that Black motorist.</i>

01:51.937 --> 01:53.200
<i>One of the two officers...</i>

01:54.288 --> 01:55.898
<i>...partially cloudy</i>

01:55.898 --> 01:57.813
<i>with 65 degrees the KFI radio.</i>

02:01.382 --> 02:02.426
Wake up.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.777
Twan, wake up, man,
it's time for school.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.138
Come on, man, wake up.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.932
School doesn't start
for another hour and a half.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.500
Yeah,

02:34.197 --> 02:36.068
I used to hate
waking up for school

02:36.068 --> 02:37.548
in the mornings, too.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.163
Made you some breakfast, man.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.730
Better get up.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.037
Come on.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.753
Weren't you the one
that said never again?

03:09.624 --> 03:11.539
There were reasons for that.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.236
He doesn't leave witnesses.

03:13.236 --> 03:16.021
I know you're not
defending that motherfucker.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.503
You know I hate him.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.027
Grew up with the fucker.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.075
This job, it's just...

03:27.468 --> 03:29.470
too big for us
to handle alone.

03:30.775 --> 03:33.082
If you want out,
this is our shot.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.741
Let me handle the old man.

03:45.268 --> 03:46.226
All right.

03:48.097 --> 03:52.101
All right, last one.
But for real this time.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.757
Come on.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.280
- Love you, bro.
- Love you, too.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.325
Hit me up later.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.505
<i>It began as a high-speed chase</i>

04:04.505 --> 04:06.550
<i>and ended early
Sunday morning with</i>

04:06.550 --> 04:08.552
<i>the motorist, a Black male,
being thrown...</i>

04:08.552 --> 04:10.554
Breakfast of champions
right here.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.469
<i>...struck as many as 56 times</i>

04:12.469 --> 04:14.341
<i>and suffered
several broken bones.</i>

04:14.341 --> 04:15.516
<i>Fifty six times,</i>

04:15.516 --> 04:16.691
<i>that's what
the American public</i>

04:16.691 --> 04:18.083
<i>will be hearing of today.</i>

04:18.083 --> 04:21.173
<i>The suspect, identified
as Rodney Glenn King.</i>

04:21.173 --> 04:25.003
<i>King who is married and has
two stepchildren was on parole</i>

04:25.003 --> 04:27.179
<i>after serving time
for armed robbery.</i>

04:27.179 --> 04:29.356
<i>Doctors said
he suffered a concussion...</i>

04:29.356 --> 04:32.272
So you just gonna ignore me
every morning?

04:33.621 --> 04:34.883
What do you want me to say?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.580
<i>...from the blows to his face</i>

04:36.580 --> 04:39.191
<i>that would require
reconstructive surgery.</i>

04:39.191 --> 04:40.323
<i>And for what I've seen,</i>

04:40.323 --> 04:41.585
<i>none of the prison...</i>

04:41.585 --> 04:43.631
I feel like you got me
locked up in a cage.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.331
At least at Ma and Grandma's

04:48.331 --> 04:50.768
they let me hang and kick it
with my friends.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.596
I don't have
no type of freedom here.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.164
So, what do you want?

04:56.165 --> 04:58.863
You wasn't there
for my childhood,

04:58.863 --> 05:00.865
and you wasn't there
for their accident.

05:00.865 --> 05:01.997
<i>This is
something that never should</i>

05:01.997 --> 05:03.128
<i>have happened.</i>

05:03.128 --> 05:04.652
<i>These procedures...</i>

05:04.652 --> 05:06.871
Look, I know it's hard not
having them around anymore.

05:08.351 --> 05:09.483
It's hard for me, too.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.877
But you're with me now.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.489
<i>The difference
this time is that...</i>

05:15.489 --> 05:17.404
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.362
<i>It's not an isolated incident.</i>

05:19.362 --> 05:20.929
I know we've been
running around

05:20.929 --> 05:22.887
up in this small space,

05:22.887 --> 05:25.368
trying to feel each other out.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.761
<i>The Black
community is not buying that.</i>

05:26.761 --> 05:28.153
<i>About 300...</i>

05:28.153 --> 05:29.459
But we got this.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.679
<i>...marched on
police headquarters today.</i>

05:31.679 --> 05:32.897
We in this.

05:32.897 --> 05:33.855
<i>This is an aberration...</i>

05:33.855 --> 05:35.596
We just gotta stay the course.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.380
<i>...never have happened.</i>

05:37.380 --> 05:39.121
<i>The incident
early Sunday morning is not</i>

05:39.121 --> 05:42.342
<i>an isolated incident.
The difference this time</i>

05:42.342 --> 05:43.473
<i>is that we have the proof.</i>

05:43.473 --> 05:44.692
<i>Right, right,</i>

05:44.692 --> 05:46.346
<i>do you have any idea
how many guys...</i>

05:47.825 --> 05:50.219
<i>What do you
remember about that?</i>

05:50.219 --> 05:52.743
Shit might get a little crazy
out there today.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.791
So you need to come
straight home from school.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.358
<i>And I'm announcing today</i>

05:58.358 --> 05:59.837
<i>that we have
obtained indictments...</i>

06:01.622 --> 06:03.841
<i>against four Los Angeles

06:03.841 --> 06:06.104
<i>LAPD Officer
Laurence Powell...</i>

06:06.104 --> 06:07.367
That's some bullshit.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.413

06:18.465 --> 06:20.945

12:11.992 --> 12:13.863
Front gate is taken care of.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.213
We got the code in, 1992.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.912
Who told you all about this?

12:18.912 --> 12:21.262
<i>The machinist in there
got me the layout.</i>

12:22.480 --> 12:23.786
What, he drop his pants
and just

12:23.786 --> 12:25.092
told you all this shit?

12:25.614 --> 12:26.702
Yeah.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.573
Been drinking with him
for over a year.

12:28.573 --> 12:31.272
- You paying him?
- Nope.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.187
Bleeding it out of him
a little at a time.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.449
I roughed out a sketch

12:34.449 --> 12:35.624
of what I think
it looks like in there.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.409
We enter through
the loading dock,

12:38.409 --> 12:39.584
<i>that's the rear
of the building.</i>

12:40.890 --> 12:43.066
<i>That'd drop us into
the security office.</i>

12:46.113 --> 12:48.071
<i>Past that is the machine shop.</i>

12:48.071 --> 12:49.159
<i>That's the main room.</i>

12:51.074 --> 12:52.902
<i>That's where all
the mechanicals are.</i>

12:52.902 --> 12:56.384
<i>And in the back,
that's where the vault is.</i>

12:56.384 --> 12:58.168
<i>That's where they keep
the platinum locked up.</i>

12:59.561 --> 13:01.519
<i>It should weigh
around 900 pounds.</i>

13:03.695 --> 13:06.350
There's a panic button
in the security office.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.918
And if it gets pressed,
an alarm goes off

13:08.918 --> 13:11.051
and a massive steel cap
comes down,

13:11.921 --> 13:13.793
encases the safe entirely.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.144
If that happens,
it's over, done.

13:17.144 --> 13:20.016
The LAPD's got to come in,
punch in a release code.

13:20.016 --> 13:23.933
Yeah, the government uses one
just like it, right?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.979
It's the
National Archives Museum.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.415
Yeah.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.286
It's where they keep the
Declaration of Independence.

13:36.598 --> 13:37.599
What?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.125
Security's just too tight.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.998
There's cameras everywhere.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.042
I mean...

13:47.174 --> 13:50.786
I love the idea
of $10 million but,

13:50.786 --> 13:52.962
this is just
out of our league.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.703
It's just over our heads.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.796
All right, so if it's not some
nickel-and-dime pawn shop,

14:00.796 --> 14:01.928
you won't heist it.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.626
It's Fort Knox
with a fucking vault.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.715
You'd need a miracle
to pull this off.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.804
Well, you keep doing
that small-time shit.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.501
Because for me, this is it.
I'm out.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.069

out of here.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.897

14:42.142 --> 14:43.143

14:47.234 --> 14:48.626
All right, man.
Take care.

15:10.866 --> 15:11.867

15:13.477 --> 15:14.478

15:15.653 --> 15:17.742

15:17.742 --> 15:18.961
Oh, here we go.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.354
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.877

15:23.009 --> 15:25.185

I get to a Laker game,

15:25.185 --> 15:27.491

15:27.491 --> 15:28.666

I got to tell you?

15:28.666 --> 15:29.841
My man's working on it.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.148
You been saying that

15:32.670 --> 15:34.368

15:34.368 --> 15:36.761

15:36.761 --> 15:38.676
Ain't nobody going

15:38.676 --> 15:40.069

16:15.452 --> 16:16.888
Never.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.760
Crooked cops like that
is the reason

16:18.760 --> 16:20.631
why I quit the force
in the first place.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.069
I got this job

25:10.813 --> 25:11.858
Bring it on.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.687
So, when will you
be back, Cope?

25:14.687 --> 25:16.515
Uh...

25:16.515 --> 25:17.559

I was wondering, is this

26:07.783 --> 26:10.133
Nah, the boss said
"Everyone go home," Mercer.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.529
Yeah, I was thinking maybe

26:14.529 --> 26:16.792
I can bring my son
back up here.

26:17.488 --> 26:18.881
So to be more safe.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.493
Nah, I don't think
that's a good idea, man.

26:47.736 --> 26:48.737

wanna join me,

38:26.347 --> 38:29.089
Stop! This is not right.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.917
I got your car!
I got his car!

38:33.876 --> 38:35.530
Antoine!

38:46.802 --> 38:48.369
Get in! Get in!

39:07.083 --> 39:08.520
Antoine!

39:11.305 --> 39:13.438
Antoine, the fuck is you doing?

39:13.438 --> 39:15.701
You lost your damn mind?

39:15.701 --> 39:18.007
You're gonna party
into the night, motherfuckers.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.282
Hey,
you gotta be gentle.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.719
What?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.024
Stop.

39:35.024 --> 39:38.114
You gotta be gentle.
You can't drill too deep.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.638
You gotta kiss her
before you fuck her.

39:39.638 --> 39:40.943
Got it, got it.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.945
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

39:46.732 --> 39:47.776
Good, good.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.434
What the hell is going on?

40:38.348 --> 40:40.307
Come on, come on.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.227
Almost there, almost there.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.187
Out of the way!

40:52.319 --> 40:53.451
Out of the way!

40:55.888 --> 40:57.629
Cope, move, move!

40:57.629 --> 40:59.631
Oh, shit.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.071
Fuck, man!

41:05.071 --> 41:08.944
God damn! Rigg! Come on, Rigg!

41:08.944 --> 41:11.773
Oh, fuck! Move that shit!

41:16.343 --> 41:17.344
Fuck.

41:18.606 --> 41:19.607
Goddamn it.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.176
God. Fuck!

41:24.438 --> 41:25.787
Rigg!
It's all right.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.006
- It's okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

41:28.137 --> 41:29.182
Come on, Rigg.

41:29.182 --> 41:30.357
Don't move.
Don't move.

41:30.357 --> 41:31.532
Hold on, we gotta get him out.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.012
We can pull him
out, yeah?

41:33.012 --> 41:34.666
We can pull him,
we'll pull him.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.494
You can't move the forklift.

41:38.583 --> 41:39.975
Fucking kidding me.

41:41.324 --> 41:42.630
We gotta get him out.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.893
You ain't getting him out
from under the forklift.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.155
Not with his leg
still attached.

41:46.155 --> 41:47.679
Just hold on a second, everybody.

41:47.679 --> 41:49.028
Calm the fuck down!

41:49.028 --> 41:50.638
You can't fucking
talk to me like that.

41:50.638 --> 41:52.814
- Fuck!
-It's okay.

41:55.251 --> 41:57.210
Hey, I got you, man.
I got you.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.951
His leg is gone
one way or another.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.343
It's just fucking gone.

42:00.343 --> 42:01.780
We move it back a little bit.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.998
There's no way!

42:06.524 --> 42:08.003
What the fuck are you doing?

42:08.003 --> 42:09.570
Get the fuck out of my face.

42:09.570 --> 42:10.919
Touch me one more time, girl,

42:10.919 --> 42:12.312
I'm gonna break
your fucking face.

42:12.878 --> 42:14.270
Rigg!

42:14.270 --> 42:16.577
Fucking hell. What?

42:16.577 --> 42:18.536
That shit
is beyond fucked, man.

42:21.277 --> 42:22.757
Are you shitting me?

42:22.757 --> 42:24.324
Cut his fucking leg.

42:24.324 --> 42:25.804
You gotta make a decision.

42:27.370 --> 42:28.981
Millions or a little leg?

42:30.025 --> 42:31.331
What are you gonna do?

42:31.331 --> 42:33.333
- It's your job.
-We're falling behind.

42:33.812 --> 42:35.030
Just cut it.

42:35.030 --> 42:36.510
We'll get him
the help he needs

42:36.510 --> 42:37.990
when we're done.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.605
Will someone turn off
that fucking alarm?

42:50.089 --> 42:51.612
<i>Charlie Mac one-niner.</i>

42:51.612 --> 42:55.137
<i>We got an alarm call
at Pluton Metals in Vernon.</i>

42:55.137 --> 42:56.356
<i>We'll do a flyby.</i>

42:56.356 --> 42:57.575
<i>Go check it out.</i>

42:57.575 --> 42:58.706
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

43:15.680 --> 43:17.290
Yo, fuck this country!

43:20.032 --> 43:22.121
Fuck America!

43:30.695 --> 43:32.435
Yo, fuck the police!
Fuck them!

43:32.435 --> 43:34.046
Fuck the police!

43:42.620 --> 43:45.187
Get your ass back in this car
and sit still.

43:56.068 --> 43:57.330
Why'd you stop me, Pop?

43:58.679 --> 44:00.855
These cops get to run
through our hoods

44:00.855 --> 44:02.640
doing whatever the fuck
they wanna do to us

44:02.640 --> 44:04.424
but we can't express
ourselves?

44:04.424 --> 44:06.078
Antoine, chill out.

44:06.078 --> 44:07.557
Fuck that, Pop!
We angry, man!

44:07.557 --> 44:08.950
We angry, too!

44:10.517 --> 44:12.214
This ain't our first rodeo.

44:16.305 --> 44:19.265
1965...

44:19.265 --> 44:21.789
See, the white folks called it
the Watts Riots.

44:23.008 --> 44:26.446
We called it the Uprise,
the Watts Rebellion.

44:28.883 --> 44:32.757
I was around your same age,
so I feel you.

44:34.889 --> 44:36.674
See, what we
didn't think about,

44:37.892 --> 44:40.373
we burn all of our own shit
down.

44:40.373 --> 44:42.157
What we gonna
have left for us?

44:44.594 --> 44:46.074
Pop, what we got now, man?

44:47.902 --> 44:50.339
Man, I don't see your name
on none of these stores.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.125
We don't own shit.

44:54.082 --> 44:56.084
So who gives a fuck if...

44:56.084 --> 44:58.913
So who cares that we burn down
the shit that they own?

44:58.913 --> 45:00.654
- They.
- They!

45:00.654 --> 45:01.699
Look around.

45:03.396 --> 45:07.313
There's no cops, there's no
ambulance, no fire trucks.

45:08.793 --> 45:10.708
They don't give
a fuck about us.

45:11.926 --> 45:13.014
We're doing exactly

45:13.014 --> 45:15.103
what these white folks
want us to do.

45:16.670 --> 45:17.889
Gotta think, Twan!

45:29.596 --> 45:30.771
<i>...they really don't know</i>

45:30.771 --> 45:32.338
<i>what to do right now.</i>

45:32.338 --> 45:35.036
<i>There are TV cameras all over,
there are people all over.</i>

45:35.036 --> 45:37.647
<i>I don't think anybody
really knows what to do</i>

45:37.647 --> 45:39.737
<i>and how to get this
under control.</i>

45:39.737 --> 45:42.217
<i>This is a super swap
meet location.</i>

45:42.217 --> 45:43.784
<i>Someone actually...</i>

45:43.784 --> 45:45.394
<i>A group of 100 people</i>

45:45.394 --> 45:48.702
<i>went into this location
and looted it.</i>

45:48.702 --> 45:51.052
<i>And every time they go in
and loot</i>

45:51.052 --> 45:53.402
<i>and they're done looting,</i>

45:53.402 --> 45:54.969
<i>they set fire
to the structure.</i>

45:54.969 --> 45:56.144
Come on, man,

45:56.144 --> 45:58.016
get all of them,
everything you can.

45:58.016 --> 45:59.147
You got toilet paper?

45:59.147 --> 46:00.453
Get the shit.
Go, go, go.

46:02.847 --> 46:04.587
Come on.
Fuck!

46:04.587 --> 46:06.024
Holy shit!

46:06.024 --> 46:07.634
-What the fuck?
- Get the fuck out the car now!

46:07.634 --> 46:09.462
Leave us alone.
Come here!

46:09.462 --> 46:11.551
Hey! Fuck off!
Get off me, man!

46:11.551 --> 46:12.770
Fuck out of here, man!

46:12.770 --> 46:14.206
Whoa, hey!
Whoa, man! What the...

46:14.206 --> 46:15.381
Give me

46:15.381 --> 46:16.469
Back up, back up!

46:16.469 --> 46:17.775

-Hey!

46:17.775 --> 46:18.993
Get the fuck back, man.

46:18.993 --> 46:20.516
Don't touch her, man,
leave her alone.

46:20.516 --> 46:21.953
Get the fuck back.
Give me the fucking keys.

46:21.953 --> 46:23.389
-Whoa, whoa.
- Where the fuck the keys at?

46:23.389 --> 46:24.651
Let's go!

46:24.651 --> 46:25.957
Hey, hey!

46:25.957 --> 46:29.787
Stay in the car,
lock the doors and don't move.

46:30.657 --> 46:31.919
Help!

46:31.919 --> 46:34.052
Y'all gonna
get fucked up tonight!

46:34.052 --> 46:35.488
Please, don't shoot us.

46:36.271 --> 46:37.707
Hey, back up!

46:37.707 --> 46:39.318
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

46:39.318 --> 46:41.363
-Back the fuck up!
- I'll do whatever you want.

46:41.363 --> 46:43.365
- Give me the fucking keys!
- No, no, they're in the car.

46:44.105 --> 46:46.325
Back up. Hey, back up.

46:46.891 --> 46:48.153
Leave 'em alone.

46:48.153 --> 46:49.894
Back the fuck up, man.
None of your business.

46:49.894 --> 46:51.373
Leave 'em alone.

46:51.373 --> 46:52.418
Come on, man.

47:02.341 --> 47:03.646
Get in, get in!

47:04.430 --> 47:05.518
Let's go.

47:05.518 --> 47:07.781
Get the fuck out of here, now!

47:07.781 --> 47:09.783
Shit. You okay?

47:09.783 --> 47:11.437
Watch out!

47:12.742 --> 47:13.743
Now!

47:33.938 --> 47:35.200
Put your seatbelt on.

48:17.503 --> 48:20.593
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:39.307 --> 48:40.308
Murph!

48:41.266 --> 48:42.267
Okay.

48:45.487 --> 48:46.967
I think we're good.

48:46.967 --> 48:49.970
Get the Tovex.

48:49.970 --> 48:51.667
This fucking safe's
a punchline.

48:51.667 --> 48:52.712
Move.

49:00.894 --> 49:02.156
Dennis, detonators.

49:03.679 --> 49:04.854
- Dennis!
-Yeah.

49:35.276 --> 49:36.669
Lights, lights, lights.

49:37.931 --> 49:39.019
Dennis.

49:56.732 --> 49:58.430
<i>Charlie Mac one-niner.</i>

49:58.430 --> 50:00.475
<i>Dispatch, it looks pretty
quiet over in Vernon</i>

50:00.475 --> 50:02.477
<i>at Pluton Metals.</i>

<i>We're gonna head over
to Crenshaw area, over.</i>

50:05.785 --> 50:06.873
<i>Copy that.</i>

50:11.617 --> 50:13.358
Let's keep going.

50:13.358 --> 50:15.534
- He's gone. Let's go.
-Let's keep going.

50:27.981 --> 50:29.896
Yo, Pop, that was some real
shit back there, man.

50:31.550 --> 50:34.379
You messed them fools up
and you wasn't even scared.

50:34.379 --> 50:35.423
Nice.

50:38.992 --> 50:41.038
You know what scares me
about you?

50:42.865 --> 50:45.129
I don't want you to grow up
to be like me.

50:48.915 --> 50:50.743
My only reputation is

50:51.961 --> 50:53.702
putting niggers on their back.

50:56.662 --> 50:58.142
What's wrong with that, Pop?

51:02.581 --> 51:03.712
What's wrong with that?

51:09.283 --> 51:11.720
Stay calm,
we'll be in and out.

51:30.391 --> 51:32.176
Where do you think
you two are going?

51:34.830 --> 51:35.962
To work.

51:36.919 --> 51:38.007
There's a curfew.

51:38.921 --> 51:40.401
License and registration.

51:42.229 --> 51:43.970
I'm on my way
to work, Officer.

51:51.020 --> 51:52.848
It's okay, move along.

51:56.417 --> 51:58.941
He just let them go,
that's some bullshit, man.

51:58.941 --> 52:00.247
You got something to say, boy?

52:00.247 --> 52:01.248
<i>One ID six project...</i>

52:01.248 --> 52:03.163
No, sir, he doesn't.

52:03.163 --> 52:05.774
Get out. Open the trunk.

52:06.384 --> 52:07.646
Why?

52:07.646 --> 52:09.169
I need to make sure
you're not transporting

52:09.169 --> 52:10.823
stolen property, that's why.

52:10.823 --> 52:11.954
But we're not.

52:11.954 --> 52:13.217
I said get the fuck
out of the car

52:13.217 --> 52:14.783
and open up the trunk.

52:14.783 --> 52:16.785
Pop, you don't have to get out
of the car, man.

52:16.785 --> 52:19.614
- Just chill. I'm chill.
- Get the fuck out!

52:19.614 --> 52:22.182
- Get him out and check.
- Fuck this shit.

52:22.182 --> 52:23.227
Let's go.

52:25.664 --> 52:26.665
Hands on the hood.

52:32.888 --> 52:34.716
Do you have any
weapons or contraband on you?

52:35.152 --> 52:36.196
No, sir.

52:36.196 --> 52:37.632
Do you have anything

52:37.632 --> 52:39.504
that could stick, poke,
cut or harm me in any way?

52:39.504 --> 52:40.592
No, sir.

52:40.592 --> 52:41.636
Spread 'em.

52:43.508 --> 52:44.987
Pop, they can't
search us, man.

52:44.987 --> 52:46.424
They don't have no warrant.

52:46.424 --> 52:47.512
Shut up.

52:48.252 --> 52:49.688
Don't do that to my son.

52:49.688 --> 52:51.559
I said shut the fuck up.

52:52.604 --> 52:54.997
Are you listening to me?

52:54.997 --> 52:56.782
Well, it looks like
you have a problem listening,

52:56.782 --> 52:58.610
so I'm giving you
this hearing aid.

52:58.610 --> 53:01.221
- Yo, these fucking cops...
-Shut up!

53:01.221 --> 53:03.615
Keep your hands on the car,
don't fucking move.

53:03.615 --> 53:04.659
Twan.

53:07.314 --> 53:09.751
This is all you need, man.

53:09.751 --> 53:11.579
Please,
please, please...

53:22.111 --> 53:23.765
All right, it's clean.

53:32.513 --> 53:33.514
Where'd you say you work?

53:37.866 --> 53:39.738

53:42.131 --> 53:44.090
I better not
see you two again.

53:44.090 --> 53:45.657
You listening to me?

53:45.657 --> 53:47.093
Now get the fuck out of here.

53:48.747 --> 53:49.748
Let him go.

53:54.970 --> 53:56.363
Let's go. Come on.

54:32.530 --> 54:34.271
All right, let's fuck her up.

55:13.048 --> 55:16.225
We're rich, boys. We're rich!

55:16.225 --> 55:19.228
Let's get it in the van
and get the fuck out of here.

55:21.056 --> 55:23.842
Copeland, you're gonna be
able to buy yourself

55:23.842 --> 55:26.279
a brand-new foot
with all this money.

55:26.279 --> 55:28.368
Better than the original.

55:32.067 --> 55:33.591
I'm proud of you, son.

55:33.591 --> 55:35.157
We're gonna be millionaires.

55:36.289 --> 55:37.638
We're gonna be millionaires.

55:38.726 --> 55:40.380
Yeah.

55:40.380 --> 55:41.729
I gotta prep the van.

56:19.114 --> 56:20.246
<i>...right down</i>

56:20.246 --> 56:21.508
<i>the middle of the street.</i>

56:21.508 --> 56:23.205
<i>It is a multiracial crowd,</i>

56:23.205 --> 56:26.252
<i>it's not predominantly
any color.</i>

56:26.252 --> 56:28.689
<i>One stands
in the middle of the...</i>

56:28.689 --> 56:31.605
<i>That one fellow is lighting
the trees, is he not?</i>

56:31.605 --> 56:33.738
<i>Yeah, it looks like he's going
along block to block</i>

56:33.738 --> 56:35.827
<i>and nobody's stopping him.</i>

56:37.306 --> 56:39.308
<i>Great fuel for an arson.</i>

56:39.308 --> 56:41.572
<i>One tree after another.</i>

57:11.776 --> 57:12.907
<i>I talked to some</i>

57:12.907 --> 57:14.387
<i>of the officers
a little while ago</i>

57:14.387 --> 57:16.868
<i>and they really don't know
what to do right now.</i>

57:16.868 --> 57:19.000
<i>I don't think anybody
really knows what to do</i>

57:19.000 --> 57:21.829
<i>and how to get this
under control.</i>

57:21.829 --> 57:23.962
<i>This is
a super swap meeting location.</i>

57:23.962 --> 57:26.094
<i>Actually a group
of over 100...</i>

57:26.094 --> 57:27.748
Where did you say
the bathroom was?

57:27.748 --> 57:29.010
<i>...and looted it.</i>

57:29.010 --> 57:30.795
Left, down the hall.

57:30.795 --> 57:32.274
<i>After they're done looting,</i>

57:32.274 --> 57:33.667
<i>they set fire
to the structure.</i>

57:56.603 --> 57:58.823
<i>At least
one fireman has been shot.</i>

57:58.823 --> 58:01.303
<i>We don't know
what his condition is.</i>

58:01.303 --> 58:03.044
<i>It's pretty chaotic
out here...</i>

58:03.044 --> 58:04.089
Joe!

58:28.417 --> 58:29.418
Hey!

58:40.168 --> 58:41.300
Antoine.

58:58.186 --> 58:59.623
I'm gonna go the other way.

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:50.576
Fucking kids.

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:52.143
Never here when you need them.

01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:57.714
Dad!

01:01:58.889 --> 01:01:59.890
Dad!

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:07.245
Who in the fuck
is this?

01:02:07.245 --> 01:02:10.378
I was in the bathroom
and he came in.

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.034
Sit right there.

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.341
I, uh... Here.

01:02:17.168 --> 01:02:18.517
I took the wallet off him.

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:19.561
Shut up!

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:21.825
Shut up, Copeland.

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.609
Shut your fucking mouth,
shut up.

01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:27.004
Where's your brother?
We gotta get

01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:28.396
- the fuck out of here.
- I don't know.

01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:30.790
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:33.271
Shut the fuck up.

01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:35.055
I'm telling you,
shut the fuck up.

01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:36.927
Cope, Cope, Cope. Hey.

01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:40.539
Hey, come on.

01:02:40.539 --> 01:02:41.670
You're okay, Cope.

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:49.766
Antoine King.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.509
2431 West 62nd Place.

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.426
And you're a sophomore
at Crenshaw High?

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:03.780
What the fuck are you doing
here, crashing our party?

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:06.826
What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:08.480
I came looking for my dad.

01:03:09.263 --> 01:03:10.308
He works here.

01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:12.179
What does your dad do?

01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:13.659
Maintenance.

01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:16.009
- What?
- Maintenance. I...

01:03:16.009 --> 01:03:17.794
I tried to go home,
but I couldn't.

01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:20.100
The bus lines were down.

01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:23.930
So, I came here
looking for him.

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:28.282
Wake the fuck up.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.633
Where's my son?

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.766
Where's my son?

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.247
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:42.035
You and your boys are robbing
this joint right now. Right?

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:45.952
Who are you?

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.353
You don't know
who you're fucking with.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.662
Man, this is not gonna end
well for you.

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.840
It's not going well for me.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:10.194
It's damn sure
not going well for you.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:13.850
Please.

01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:57.850
You came here
to look for your dad?

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.548
Huh? Huh?

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:02.724
Yes, yes, yes,
but he's not here.

01:05:08.513 --> 01:05:09.514
You know what?

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.214
Today's your lucky day.

01:05:15.476 --> 01:05:17.043
'Cause I'm feeling charitable.

01:05:18.697 --> 01:05:20.394
So, I'm gonna let you go.

01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:24.703
I'm gonna let you go home
to your daddy.

01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:27.097
- No!
- I swear to...

01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:30.404
- What the fuck?
-Oh, shit!

01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:45.724
I know where you live.

01:05:45.724 --> 01:05:51.251
If you talk to anyone about
who or what you saw here,

01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:53.340
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.996
I'm gonna kill your father,
your mother, your dog,

01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:58.345
every relative you ever had.

01:05:58.345 --> 01:06:00.869
I'm gonna obliterate
your whole fucking family,

01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:01.958
you little fuck!

01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:12.272
Goodbye.

01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:16.059
Get the fuck outta here.

01:06:28.767 --> 01:06:30.160
Lowell!

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.336
Someone fucked us up!

01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:34.468
- Where's Riggin?
- They took him!

01:06:34.468 --> 01:06:35.948
Hey, Crenshaw, stop!

01:06:36.688 --> 01:06:38.429
Stop!

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:40.953
Stop and get your ass
back here.

01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:43.173
Now.

01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:46.959
Get over here.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:54.836
Easy, easy, easy.
We're gonna use him.

01:06:58.275 --> 01:07:00.059
- Where's your father?
-I don't know.

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.539
You were
fucking lying to me

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:03.149
- before, weren't you?
-I don't know.

01:07:03.149 --> 01:07:04.629
- You're fucking lying to me.
- I swear to God, I don't know.

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:07.719
What do you want to do
with him?

01:07:09.068 --> 01:07:10.852
We're gonna use him.

01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:12.550
-Fuck.
- We're gonna use him.

01:07:28.087 --> 01:07:29.349
- Fuck.
-Check the van!

01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:30.872
I see that.

01:07:34.876 --> 01:07:35.877
Fuck.

01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:43.755
- Murph.
- What?

01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:46.279
We got a problem.

01:07:46.279 --> 01:07:48.499
What the fuck is it?

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:49.935
The ignition rotor is missing.

01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:52.590
The fuck is a rotor?

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:54.374
We can't start the van
without it.

01:07:58.117 --> 01:07:59.205
Son of a bitch.

01:08:16.788 --> 01:08:18.529
Boss.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:20.705
We can't find Riggin anywhere.

01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:21.967
What?

01:08:21.967 --> 01:08:24.317
Yes, and we can't...

01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:26.406
start the van either.

01:08:27.581 --> 01:08:28.887
Why the fuck not?

01:08:28.887 --> 01:08:31.933
Because the ignition rotor
is missing.

01:08:36.199 --> 01:08:38.157
Your old man
is playing with your life.

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:40.638
He's playing
with your fucking life.

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.335
Maybe I should walk out

01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:44.207
and try to find
another vehicle, huh?

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:46.209
No, no, that's a bad idea.

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:47.862
What about
the two cars out in front?

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:50.213
No.

01:08:50.213 --> 01:08:52.171
Their suspensions
won't support the weight.

01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:53.781
Dad, we have to find Riggin.

01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:55.566
I know, Dennis.

01:08:55.566 --> 01:08:57.785
I'm well aware that
we don't have your brother.

01:08:59.091 --> 01:09:00.745
Just load up
the rest of the bars.

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:03.400
We'll clean up.
Let's get that fucking rotor.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.142
We'll get the fuck
out of here.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.449
I got all the leverage
I need right there.

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:34.605
Hey!

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:37.695
Hey!

01:10:04.069 --> 01:10:05.984
Give me the rotor to the van.

01:10:05.984 --> 01:10:07.507
Fuck you.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.644
Where? You fucking say!

01:10:14.471 --> 01:10:15.733
- Fuck you.
- Huh?

01:10:21.826 --> 01:10:23.262
Come on.

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:24.524
Come on, now.

01:10:24.524 --> 01:10:26.265
Okay, okay.

01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:30.138
Where is the rotor to the van?

01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:32.053
Hmm? Huh?

01:10:36.928 --> 01:10:37.929
Easy now.

01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:39.757
Easy.

01:11:30.677 --> 01:11:32.592
Sounds like you're down a dad.

01:11:39.817 --> 01:11:41.601
Son of a bitch.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.405
Just fucking relax.

01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:13.067
Don't be stupid.

01:12:38.005 --> 01:12:39.355
I guess your crew...

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:43.707
don't believe in the whole

01:12:43.707 --> 01:12:46.013
"honor among thieves"
system, huh?

01:12:49.234 --> 01:12:50.757
The old man...

01:12:51.802 --> 01:12:54.195
is a heartless motherfucker.

01:12:57.764 --> 01:12:59.766
That Black man
was on the ground...

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:04.118
he shot him up.

01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:10.386
Just fucking unloaded on him.

01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:15.913
Bullshit.

01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:18.785
He did it in front of my son.

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:27.664
Bull. Shit.

01:13:29.013 --> 01:13:31.494
Then he put the gun up
to my son's head.

01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:17.583
Look, I need you
to be honest with me.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.805
Do you know
where my brother is?

01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:33.207
I just watched your dad
kill a man.

01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:38.778
If I knew
where your brother was,

01:14:38.778 --> 01:14:40.606
believe me, I would tell you.

01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:50.007
That old man in there...

01:14:52.009 --> 01:14:53.271
that's my dad.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.276
And honestly, man,

01:14:58.276 --> 01:15:03.237
it's a fucking miracle
that your son's still alive.

01:15:05.283 --> 01:15:08.416
And now your kid,
he's just a witness.

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:12.638
He don't let witnesses live.

01:15:18.862 --> 01:15:20.385
I gotta find him.

01:15:24.476 --> 01:15:26.783
You understand that, right?

01:15:30.395 --> 01:15:32.223
But...

01:15:32.223 --> 01:15:35.705
I promise I am not
going to let anything

01:15:35.705 --> 01:15:37.141
happen to you.

01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:42.886
You girls having a nice chat?

01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:45.236
Yeah, I was...

01:15:45.236 --> 01:15:46.803
Why you fucking talking
to him?

01:15:46.803 --> 01:15:49.109
I'm getting information.

01:15:51.242 --> 01:15:53.810
Did you know that his father
has your fucking brother?

01:15:55.202 --> 01:15:56.639
Did you know that?

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:58.771
What information
are you getting?

01:15:58.771 --> 01:15:59.859
- Huh?
- It was...

01:15:59.859 --> 01:16:00.904
Shut up.

01:16:02.819 --> 01:16:04.821
Get up. Get up.

01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:09.390
You're gonna get us
out of this.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:12.437
'Cause if you don't,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:14.134
Walk.

01:16:15.527 --> 01:16:17.094
Smarten up.

01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:21.838
I never wanted
to hurt anybody.

01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:23.579
Okay?

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.059
I sure as hell
don't want anything

01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:27.495
to happen to your kid.

01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:29.628
You sure the fuck don't.

01:16:34.285 --> 01:16:35.329
<i>The toilets</i>

01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:37.027
<i>need scrubbing, Mercer.</i>

01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:38.594
The toilets need scrubbing.

01:16:39.899 --> 01:16:41.988
Shit.

01:16:41.988 --> 01:16:44.817
<i>I got somebody here
who wants to talk to you.</i>

01:16:46.384 --> 01:16:50.518
Don't trust him. Don't listen
to anything he says, man.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.436
Press the button
and say "Dad."

01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:00.267
Dad?

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:03.270
Twan.

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:05.098
They're gonna kill me.

01:17:05.098 --> 01:17:07.710
<i>Dad, they're gonna
kill me, Dad.</i>

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.062
<i>Dad, they're gonna kill me.</i>

01:17:13.498 --> 01:17:16.806
If you
don't do what they say.

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:19.983

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:22.681
<i>How about a trade?</i>

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:26.729
Your son for my son
and the rotor.

01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:30.080
He's a liar.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.735
They're just gonna kill you
and then your son.

01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:34.084
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:36.826

<i>If you bring any weapons,</i>

01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:46.705

01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:47.924

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:54.757
You're gonna help me
get my son.

01:18:15.429 --> 01:18:17.083
It's almost over, Crenshaw.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:24.612
Hey, stop right there.

01:18:24.612 --> 01:18:25.744
Dad.

01:18:27.528 --> 01:18:28.704
Stop.

01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:33.360
Get the rotor.

01:18:34.013 --> 01:18:35.014
Rigg!

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:36.755
You good?

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:38.496
Dennis, I'm cool, I'm cool.

01:18:40.628 --> 01:18:41.673
Got it.

01:18:41.673 --> 01:18:43.631
Put it back in the van.

01:18:46.156 --> 01:18:48.898
After all the bullshit
you put me through tonight,

01:18:48.898 --> 01:18:50.073
you're lucky I don't just kill

01:18:50.073 --> 01:18:51.944
this motherfucking kid
right now.

01:18:55.687 --> 01:18:56.688
Give me my son.

01:18:57.863 --> 01:19:00.518
You killed one of my guys.

01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:02.215
You fucked up my night.

01:19:03.869 --> 01:19:05.566
Let us go.

01:19:05.566 --> 01:19:06.785
You can go right back

01:19:06.785 --> 01:19:08.613
to whatever the fuck
you was doing.

01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:10.789
And if I don't?

01:19:12.095 --> 01:19:14.445
Then we got a problem, homie.

01:19:14.445 --> 01:19:17.883
Well, then I guess we got
a fucking problem, homie.

01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:21.626
Yes.

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:23.759
Goodbye, Crenshaw.

01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:27.458
- Twan! Get down
- Go, go!

01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:40.776
Oh, shit, Dennis!

01:19:42.516 --> 01:19:43.822
Get up! Get to the van!

01:19:48.871 --> 01:19:50.089
- All right?
- Go!

01:20:03.407 --> 01:20:05.191
We gotta wire the car
out front!

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:13.547
Keep the pressure.

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:15.114
Look at me.

01:20:15.114 --> 01:20:16.507
Hey. Look at me!

01:20:16.507 --> 01:20:19.727
Hey, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:29.389
Come on.

01:20:29.389 --> 01:20:31.304
- Oh, fuck!
- Dennis!

01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:41.924
Go!

01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:45.928
Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:48.104 --> 01:20:49.757
He's getting away
with my money.

01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:04.120
You're gonna be okay.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.730
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:08.037
Y'all all right?

01:21:08.037 --> 01:21:09.908
He needs a hospital!

01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:32.278
Come on, push.
Just keep pushing.

01:21:32.278 --> 01:21:34.802
Hold the pressure. Come on.
Stay with me.

01:21:34.802 --> 01:21:36.848
Hey, Rigg. Guess what?

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.197
What?

01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:40.243
We're rich.

01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.028
- We're rich.
- No.

01:21:44.812 --> 01:21:45.857
Shoot 'em.

01:21:52.342 --> 01:21:53.343
Oh, shit!

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.056
He's losing
a lot of blood.

01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:16.366
I don't wanna die, Rigg.

01:22:17.062 --> 01:22:18.063
Hold on, hold on.

01:22:30.032 --> 01:22:31.033
Hold on.

01:22:33.165 --> 01:22:34.166
Oh, no.

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:37.430
No way. Baby bro.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:39.998
Don't look back.

01:22:44.872 --> 01:22:45.873
Shit.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:59.104
No. Fuck you!

01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:00.932
Motherfucker!

01:23:24.347 --> 01:23:25.391
Fuck me.

01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:55.247

01:25:29.646 --> 01:25:30.647
Hey.

01:25:34.172 --> 01:25:36.261
I did the best
that I could, son.

01:25:39.308 --> 01:25:41.223

01:26:06.813 --> 01:26:08.032

Do you know
how much you cost...

01:26:44.068 --> 01:26:45.287
It's okay.

01:26:48.159 --> 01:26:49.291
It's okay, Twan.
