WEBVTT

00:11.250 --> 00:13.916
Let's begin near the end.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.500
The final act of a tragic story.

00:18.666 --> 00:22.208
When you've seen as many wars as I have,
you get used to it.

00:22.833 --> 00:26.666
The hard part
is watching worlds fall that don't need to

00:27.250 --> 00:30.124
because a hero can no longer rise
to meet their moment.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.208
[metal footsteps]

00:32.750 --> 00:34.249
[sighs]

00:34.250 --> 00:38.541
But I swore an oath. And so I watch.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.958
<i>In every variation of this universe,</i>

01:04.750 --> 01:07.416
<i>Riri Williams is its last best hope.</i>

01:11.666 --> 01:14.458
<i>But in every one I've watched,</i>

01:15.083 --> 01:18.958
<i>no matter how hard she fights,
and how long she struggles,</i>

01:20.125 --> 01:21.750
<i>she always fails.</i>

01:23.708 --> 01:24.750
<i>Always.</i>

01:36.416 --> 01:37.416
You're late.

01:37.916 --> 01:39.125
[Riri] Patrols are everywhere.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.249
And I'm not exactly popular
with the Iron Federation, so...

01:43.250 --> 01:45.916
Well, blowing up their convoys
probably didn't help.

01:46.458 --> 01:47.458
You have the money?

01:48.041 --> 01:49.250
You have my score?

01:50.458 --> 01:53.291
Strictly analog, just like you asked.

01:55.041 --> 01:58.625
This looks intact.
How many more can you get me?

01:59.291 --> 02:00.415
You're willing to risk a lot

02:00.416 --> 02:02.625
for someone
who doesn't strike me as the baking type.

02:03.541 --> 02:04.791
Unless the rumors are true,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.290
and what you're really cooking up
is a weapon.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.041
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:09.708 --> 02:11.250
I'm just looking to make a Bundt cake.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.999
Tread carefully, Williams.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.416
'Cause once the Federation
has you in its sights, the story's over.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.583
[distant whirring, footsteps]

02:21.750 --> 02:22.833
Nothing personal.

02:23.833 --> 02:25.124
It's just business.

02:25.125 --> 02:27.875
Yeah, well, that's the problem
with everyone these days.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.208
You never know who's real
and who's a fake.

02:33.916 --> 02:35.125
[pulsing, glass shatters]

02:37.333 --> 02:38.333
[Riri Williams grunts]

02:40.833 --> 02:42.833
Come on, come on. Why won't it start?

02:47.916 --> 02:49.958
Fake! Fake!

02:50.541 --> 02:51.874
Aah!

02:51.875 --> 02:53.291
Guess that one was real.

02:54.666 --> 02:56.791
- Y'all keepin' it real, too? Bingo.
- [pinging]

02:59.458 --> 03:00.958
Come on! Come on!

03:04.875 --> 03:07.250
- Come on! Come on, just start.
- [sputtering]

03:11.166 --> 03:12.625
[screaming]

03:15.416 --> 03:17.416
[groans]

03:19.333 --> 03:21.708
[clanging, powering down]

03:30.500 --> 03:33.040
Please be a hologram.
Please be a hologram.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.583
[screams, groans]

03:36.083 --> 03:38.333
[strains] Okay. I guess not.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.500
[choking]

03:41.791 --> 03:42.916
[screams]

03:43.958 --> 03:46.124
[thuds, groans]

03:46.125 --> 03:48.957
Who are you people?
What the hell is goin' on?

03:48.958 --> 03:51.500
I'm Admiral Ying Nan with the Alliance.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.500
He is coming about. Mystic support!

03:57.583 --> 03:59.333
Captain Valkyrie, let's move.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.625
[The Watcher] <i>Welcome to Earth.</i>

04:08.375 --> 04:10.166
<i>What's left of it anyway.</i>

04:17.041 --> 04:18.083
[The Watcher] <i>Time.</i>

04:21.541 --> 04:22.625
<i>Space.</i>

04:24.375 --> 04:25.416
<i>Reality.</i>

04:28.291 --> 04:29.958
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

04:34.833 --> 04:39.333
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

04:41.875 --> 04:45.291
<i>where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

04:48.083 --> 04:50.833
<i>creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.</i>

04:54.958 --> 04:56.291
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

04:58.541 --> 05:01.708
<i>I am your guide
through these vast new realities.</i>

05:03.125 --> 05:06.625
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

05:10.291 --> 05:11.916
<i>"What if?"</i>

05:17.625 --> 05:21.332
<i>The end of the world began
with a birth of the Celestial</i>

05:21.333 --> 05:24.041
<i>that had been gestating
deep beneath the surface.</i>

05:25.708 --> 05:27.290
<i>In this universe,</i>

05:27.291 --> 05:31.625
<i>the Emergence occurred years before
the Eternals could unite to stop it.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:36.958
<i>But one man saw the chaos
as an opportunity.</i>

05:37.708 --> 05:40.957
<i>The brilliant
but ego-maniacal engineer, Quentin Beck,</i>

05:40.958 --> 05:43.166
<i>who took over Stark Industries.</i>

05:43.708 --> 05:46.207
<i>What followed
was a long and protracted war</i>

05:46.208 --> 05:50.791
<i>between an alliance of resistance fighters
and Beck's Iron Federation.</i>

05:51.291 --> 05:53.208
<i>And with victory within his grasp,</i>

05:53.750 --> 05:59.416
<i>Beck was determined to ensure the Alliance
took its last breath before he did.</i>

06:00.166 --> 06:01.166
[breathing heavily]

06:02.166 --> 06:05.791
The Alliance is down
to their last brigade.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.500
Go to their base

06:10.625 --> 06:12.083
and end them.

06:20.458 --> 06:21.958
[breathing heavily]

06:43.208 --> 06:45.708
We pick up all kinds of stuff
floating around here.

06:47.666 --> 06:49.458
- Drink?
- [exhales]

06:50.291 --> 06:53.625
This used to be someone's,
and now it's just...

06:55.458 --> 06:56.458
wreckage.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.916
Hard to see what we have to drink to.

07:03.791 --> 07:04.958
We are still here.

07:05.916 --> 07:09.791
After the Emergence,
that seems as good a reason as any.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.291
So why am I here?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.624
Or did y'all go through all this trouble
just to make me feel special?

07:15.625 --> 07:16.832
[chuckles]

07:16.833 --> 07:18.249
Our ears on the ground say

07:18.250 --> 07:20.624
the magnetron you acquired
from the Power Broker

07:20.625 --> 07:23.125
is for a weapon of great interest to us.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.625
A weapon to destroy the Vision.

07:27.958 --> 07:30.207
So, what, you've been spying on me?

07:30.208 --> 07:31.374
Yes.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.082
- For a long time, actually.
- [sighs]

07:33.083 --> 07:34.999
Our intel indicates

07:35.000 --> 07:39.082
your weapon powers down Vibranium,
decouples it.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.832
But to take out a synthezoid,
you are going to need

07:42.833 --> 07:47.458
a lot more than one busted part
from a Kiddy Cake Cooker.

07:48.541 --> 07:51.124
Wow, okay.
Y'all really have been spying on me.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.666
We just saved your life.
I think you can trust us.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.791
[Riri] Well, that's the thing.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.416
I don't trust anyone.

07:58.791 --> 08:01.500
And from what I've heard,
the Alliance is kind of a sinking ship.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.916
Hmm. Well, you are right about that one.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.875
Our ship sank a long time ago.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.250
The Vision has ravaged our forces
across the Federation.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.874
This base is all that remains
of the Alliance.

08:33.875 --> 08:37.207
Just when you thought
things couldn't get any more hopeless.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.125
The planet may have been destroyed,

08:40.125 --> 08:41.791
but the world carries on.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.832
What you decide to make of the pieces...

08:44.833 --> 08:47.874
- [opens]
- ...well, that is up to you.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.040
Damn, this is...

08:50.041 --> 08:51.415
[Ying Nan] Everything?

08:51.416 --> 08:54.750
Everything you will need
to build your weapon.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.958
That is, of course, if you're interested.

08:58.541 --> 09:01.374
A lot of people died for all of this.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.916
If you really think
there is no hope left in this world,

09:05.500 --> 09:07.250
then make some yourself.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.333
Y'all got any snacks?

09:10.916 --> 09:12.999
I work better with brain food.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.624
- [chuckles]
- [man] <i>Admiral, we have incoming.</i>

09:15.625 --> 09:17.165
What's the molecular density?

09:17.166 --> 09:19.999
- [man] <i>Reads as variable.
-</i> [sighs]

09:20.000 --> 09:22.332
[Ying Nan] Eyes up, everyone!
Secure the perimeter!

09:22.333 --> 09:24.540
<i>- Nothing gets through to the lab.</i>
- [soldier 1] Let's go.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.749
- [soldier 2] Go, go, go!
- Two by two, two by two.

09:26.750 --> 09:29.833
[indistinct chatter]

09:50.500 --> 09:52.249
He is already here.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.374
[Valkyrie] <i>Copy that.</i>

09:53.375 --> 09:55.624
How long do you think you'll need
to build that weapon?

09:55.625 --> 09:57.499
- About 12 hours.
- Hah!

09:57.500 --> 09:58.999
Well, how long do I have?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.499
Seven-and-a-half minutes.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.165
I'm sorry, what?

10:02.166 --> 10:05.665
That's how long the Vishanti
protection spell is going to hold.

10:05.666 --> 10:07.333
No. What? What?

10:18.500 --> 10:19.750
[gunfire, man screaming]

10:25.875 --> 10:27.124
[grunting]

10:27.125 --> 10:28.625
[ricochets]

10:32.416 --> 10:34.916
Seven-and-a-half minutes. Really? Really?

10:48.458 --> 10:49.458
[thuds]

10:54.708 --> 10:55.916
[Wong] Sorry, Casper.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.625
You're not getting through.
At least not for the next five minutes.

11:01.166 --> 11:02.583
[Valkyrie, Ying Nan scream]

11:06.916 --> 11:09.874
Guess I need to be an engineer
and a magician. Cool.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.083
[both continue screaming]

11:12.500 --> 11:16.166
Just building a totally theoretical weapon
on the fly. What could go wrong?

11:17.750 --> 11:19.165
[grunting]

11:19.166 --> 11:21.666
Come on. Come on. Come on.

11:25.583 --> 11:26.583
[Wong screams]

11:33.666 --> 11:35.582
[Riri] Cool, cool!
Tick tock, Riri!

11:35.583 --> 11:37.665
In seven-and-a-half minutes.

11:37.666 --> 11:39.999
You can't grill a hamburger
in seven-and-a-half minutes,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.083
but sure, fine!

11:41.791 --> 11:44.708
Come on. Come on. Come on!

11:48.000 --> 11:50.500
Yeah. Yeah, come at me,
you dead-eyed son of a--

11:51.250 --> 11:52.249
What?

11:52.250 --> 11:55.000
No, no, no, no, no,
come on, come on, let's go!

11:55.500 --> 11:57.540
Increase the frequency wave,
reverse the polarity.

11:57.541 --> 11:59.375
- Come on, let's go!
- [charging, pulses]

12:09.833 --> 12:12.375
[gasps] You did it.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.290
Without his guard dog,

12:16.291 --> 12:19.249
Beck's illusions are gonna have
a lot less bite.

12:19.250 --> 12:22.749
Perhaps there's a little hope left
in this world after all.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.665
Good, we will need it.

12:24.666 --> 12:27.457
This location has been compromised.

12:27.458 --> 12:31.458
We will need to wipe away any last traces
of our operation and move out.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.625
What about the rest of the crew?

12:36.375 --> 12:38.625
[Ying Nan] He killed them all.

12:44.375 --> 12:49.040
<i>Reverse the polarity. Come on, let's move!
Reverse the polarity. Come on, let's move!</i>

12:49.041 --> 12:52.332
<i>Reverse the polarity. Come on, let's move!
Reverse the polarity. Come on--</i>

12:52.333 --> 12:55.915
[Beck] This shouldn't be possible!
[coughing]

12:55.916 --> 12:57.916
<i>Reverse the polarity. Come on, let's move!</i>

13:00.291 --> 13:04.125
Who the hell is Riri Williams?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.583
[Ying Nan] Our fallen allies
came from many lands,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.583
but they united for one cause.

13:16.583 --> 13:21.750
May their sacrifice be a light of hope
seen across the stars.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.458
- Light the fuse.
- Mm.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.125
[crackling]

14:03.083 --> 14:04.666
Where's Riri?

14:16.416 --> 14:18.291
[The Watcher] She's lost so much.

14:19.041 --> 14:23.666
Friends, family, the world she once knew.

14:28.958 --> 14:31.708
<i>She's clung to this fight to sustain her.</i>

14:32.541 --> 14:36.000
<i>But in the end,
it will be the fight that kills her.</i>

14:39.750 --> 14:41.125
As it always does.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.791
The Vision news has spooked Beck.

14:52.375 --> 14:56.291
He's reinforcing his Iron Legion
on every province in the Federation.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.874
Any chatter on the encrypted channels?

14:58.875 --> 15:02.916
Dead silence. We are all that is left.

15:04.083 --> 15:07.957
Hmm. Well, it's only a matter of time
before Beck finds us, too.

15:07.958 --> 15:11.500
So we take the fight to him
while we're still here and finish him.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.749
With Vision gone,
Beck has never been weaker.

15:14.750 --> 15:18.916
The illusion network is all he has left.
I say we take that from him, too.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.291
What exactly are you proposing?

15:21.833 --> 15:24.999
Beck's entire operation
is run on a nanotech network.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.290
To take it down,
we need to drop behind enemy lines,

15:27.291 --> 15:30.833
blow the nanites powering his illusions,
and then it's over.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.791
His reign, his terror.

15:33.625 --> 15:34.665
Him.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.707
His headquarters are located

15:36.708 --> 15:41.665
on a planetary fragment
on the fast side of the asteroid ring.

15:41.666 --> 15:44.749
Even if we were to survive the approach...

15:44.750 --> 15:47.040
A base like that will be heavily guarded.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.666
We'd be entering a world of illusions
completely blind.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.833
I can get us past the illusions.

15:52.416 --> 15:55.374
I can plug myself
into the system running Beck's holograms.

15:55.375 --> 15:56.749
Such technology...

15:56.750 --> 15:58.125
Is impossible.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.333
But not for Riri.

16:01.416 --> 16:03.291
It's a big swing, no doubt.

16:03.791 --> 16:05.832
That's why you gotta have vision.

16:05.833 --> 16:09.416
And wouldn't you know,
I got all his spare parts.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.500
[The Watcher sighs] Here we go again.

16:20.541 --> 16:24.916
<i>Riri Williams always thinks
she can build her way out of her problems.</i>

16:25.500 --> 16:27.290
<i>And with this latest invention,</i>

16:27.291 --> 16:29.790
<i>you wouldn't blame her
for believing she can.</i>

16:29.791 --> 16:34.583
<i>More than a suit of armor,
it's a fusion of human and machine,</i>

16:35.166 --> 16:37.207
<i>elevating her to new levels
of consciousness</i>

16:37.208 --> 16:39.458
<i>no living person has ever known.</i>

16:41.291 --> 16:42.791
You'll be a human synthezoid.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.082
There's no telling
how that power will change you

16:46.083 --> 16:48.083
or if you can ever turn back.

16:48.791 --> 16:50.291
Growing up, I lost a lot.

16:50.833 --> 16:54.041
And then the world ended
and I lost everyone else.

16:54.916 --> 16:58.208
If this will help me
take the fight to Beck, I have to do it.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.791
<i>'Cause this fight...</i>

17:02.166 --> 17:03.500
<i>is all I have left.</i>

17:13.041 --> 17:16.208
[The Watcher] <i>But even with the powers
of the Vision flowing through her,</i>

17:17.125 --> 17:21.541
<i>she still can't see...
that this is how it ends for her.</i>

17:23.166 --> 17:24.250
Always.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.583
We are approaching Beck's airspace.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
[Wong] Looks like
a heavy ground-to-air barrage.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.833
Guess that means you're up, Riri.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.333
Are you ready for this? What do you see?

17:55.333 --> 17:56.583
It's working, yeah.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.915
I can see what's real and what's fake.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.875
Just stay on my wing and you'll be fine.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
[whirring]

18:08.625 --> 18:09.625
[Riri] Fake!

18:10.833 --> 18:12.583
Fake! Fake!

18:14.583 --> 18:15.666
Fake!

18:21.416 --> 18:23.333
That's real! Light 'em up now!

18:29.166 --> 18:31.790
[groans] Whoa, whoa!

18:31.791 --> 18:33.290
- What?
- What's going on?

18:33.291 --> 18:34.540
Why are you slowing down?

18:34.541 --> 18:36.958
Something's off.
My neural network is sputtering.

18:38.791 --> 18:39.999
But I can fight through it.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.791
Come on, Riri. You can do this.
I know you can.

18:51.416 --> 18:54.291
- [explosion]
- [Riri Williams screaming]

18:55.875 --> 18:56.875
[Wong] Oh, oh, oh!

18:58.708 --> 19:00.875
[Riri Williams continues screaming]

19:01.958 --> 19:02.958
[grunts]

19:06.541 --> 19:08.207
[Ying Nan] Riri. Riri!

19:08.208 --> 19:09.665
[screams]

19:09.666 --> 19:12.290
Come on. Are you with me?
What's your status?

19:12.291 --> 19:14.250
There's something wrong
with my neural network.

19:14.791 --> 19:16.250
I can't see through the illusions.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.624
Can you still hack the control hub?

19:18.625 --> 19:20.333
If we can actually make it there.

19:21.208 --> 19:22.374
Where's the rest of the team?

19:22.375 --> 19:26.166
They're holding off Beck's forces
to give us a chance, but not for long.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.041
We need to finish this, Riri.

19:31.750 --> 19:32.750
[exhales]

19:35.083 --> 19:37.125
[panting]

19:39.250 --> 19:41.166
[distant explosions]

19:55.708 --> 19:57.082
[charging]

19:57.083 --> 19:58.375
[clanging]

20:11.041 --> 20:14.582
I've led you this far.
This is where you end it.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.666
[Riri Williams panting]

20:22.333 --> 20:23.750
Wireless connection's still dead.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.625
Old-fashioned way it is.

20:26.708 --> 20:29.457
Just the fate of the literal world
at your fingertips.

20:29.458 --> 20:30.541
No presh.

20:31.375 --> 20:32.624
You might wanna take cover.

20:32.625 --> 20:33.958
This is about to get--

20:35.666 --> 20:37.208
What? No.

20:37.708 --> 20:40.916
No, no, no!

20:42.083 --> 20:43.541
No! Ying Nan!

20:44.875 --> 20:47.416
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

20:51.458 --> 20:52.875
[Beck laughing]

20:53.458 --> 20:54.958
Come on, Riri.

20:55.541 --> 20:57.708
You should know in this world,

20:58.750 --> 21:01.040
you can't trust anyone.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.499
No, this doesn't make any sense.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.374
We navigated the holograms,
followed the coordinates.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.375
The nanite network should be here!

21:09.875 --> 21:10.958
And it is

21:11.625 --> 21:14.707
because I am the network.

21:14.708 --> 21:15.791
What the...

21:16.375 --> 21:18.457
You're not the first person

21:18.458 --> 21:22.958
to give themselves
a high-tech makeover, Riri.

21:24.750 --> 21:29.040
I had my nanites uploaded into my body

21:29.041 --> 21:32.332
so I could control all my illusions

21:32.333 --> 21:34.707
with the blink of an eye.

21:34.708 --> 21:37.415
So if you came to take them from me,

21:37.416 --> 21:40.665
I'm afraid you're gonna have to pluck them

21:40.666 --> 21:44.458
out of my cold dead body.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.375
By the looks of it,
I won't have to wait very long.

21:47.875 --> 21:50.165
The tech has come at a price,

21:50.166 --> 21:52.416
but it was worth it because now,

21:53.000 --> 21:57.457
you are all that remains of the Alliance.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.666
No. These are all lies!

22:03.125 --> 22:06.916
Easy, Riri.
I shut down your phasing capabilities.

22:07.583 --> 22:10.375
I programmed Vision, remember?

22:10.875 --> 22:13.707
And from the moment
you brought his tech back online,

22:13.708 --> 22:17.749
I've allowed you to do just enough

22:17.750 --> 22:19.290
to come right to me.

22:19.291 --> 22:21.375
- [electricity crackling]
- [screaming]

22:25.458 --> 22:27.415
Then why bring me here?

22:27.416 --> 22:31.624
So I can live to enjoy my victory.

22:31.625 --> 22:34.749
I didn't think
I had much time left in this world

22:34.750 --> 22:40.082
until I saw this brilliant little glow-up
of yours and realized

22:40.083 --> 22:42.165
I don't need my body

22:42.166 --> 22:44.165
when I can have Vision's.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.749
[screaming louder]

22:45.750 --> 22:50.041
It'll be so much faster
if you don't fight, Riri.

22:51.250 --> 22:53.207
See? Almost done.

22:53.208 --> 22:56.750
It's too bad. I was starting to feel
like we had a connection.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.749
That's the thing about connections.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.416
- They go both ways.
- [powering down]

23:03.416 --> 23:04.416
[grunting]

23:07.500 --> 23:09.833
[screaming]

23:11.625 --> 23:13.832
If you hadn't noticed,
I'm kind of stubborn,

23:13.833 --> 23:15.541
and I've come too far to give up now.

23:17.666 --> 23:18.666
[Beck] Oh!

23:19.083 --> 23:20.583
But you will.

23:21.708 --> 23:22.708
[laughs]

23:24.416 --> 23:25.416
[screams]

23:30.625 --> 23:34.000
Beck, put away these magic tricks
and stop hiding!

23:36.208 --> 23:37.208
You're right.

23:39.416 --> 23:41.958
If my illusions will not break you,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.333
perhaps the truth will.

23:48.416 --> 23:51.208
You never left the fields.

23:57.166 --> 23:58.166
[gasps]

24:02.291 --> 24:04.291
[sobbing]

24:05.583 --> 24:07.500
[Beck] Your team is dead.

24:08.666 --> 24:11.208
The Alliance is dead.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.541
You failed.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.416
You failed your friends.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.333
You...

24:22.083 --> 24:25.583
You have nothing left to fight for.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.666
[The Watcher] <i>This is it.</i>

24:29.375 --> 24:31.583
The moment where it always ends.

24:32.291 --> 24:33.750
Her spirit is exhausted.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.833
<i>She's seen too much, lost too much.</i>

24:38.541 --> 24:42.625
<i>Her will to fight is all Riri Williams
felt she had left in this world,</i>

24:43.166 --> 24:46.083
and now she's lost that, too.

24:56.291 --> 24:58.666
[The Watcher] <i>Finally, at the end,</i>

<i>without any hope left,</i>

25:02.666 --> 25:03.833
<i>I just...</i>

25:04.625 --> 25:08.041
I don't know if I can bear
to watch it one more time.

25:13.041 --> 25:16.041
- Yes!
- [groaning, grunts]

25:24.458 --> 25:26.457
Oh, thatta girl, Riri.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.958
You don't have to resist anymore.

25:36.541 --> 25:37.583
No.

25:45.541 --> 25:46.750
Fight.

25:48.875 --> 25:49.916
<i>Riri.</i>

25:50.666 --> 25:51.666
<i>Fight.</i>

25:52.250 --> 25:54.250
<i>- Fight back.</i>

[crackling]

25:58.958 --> 25:59.958
What?

26:04.958 --> 26:06.958
What... What's happening?

26:12.041 --> 26:13.875
[gasps] No, no!

26:15.541 --> 26:17.499
No, no, no, no!

26:17.500 --> 26:19.291
No, no, what are you doing?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.790
Finishing this.

26:25.791 --> 26:27.625
I beat you!

26:28.208 --> 26:29.458
[screaming]

26:34.083 --> 26:36.166
No! No, no, no, no!

[gasps, coughs]

26:41.541 --> 26:43.083
[gasping heavily]

26:45.875 --> 26:47.707
I see through your reality.

26:47.708 --> 26:50.125
No, no, no. [coughs]

26:54.500 --> 26:55.750
And I'm shutting it down.

26:56.333 --> 27:00.124
I am the master of illusions!

27:00.125 --> 27:04.915
I can make it
like your little victory never happened.

27:04.916 --> 27:08.124
The people will never know.

27:08.125 --> 27:11.458
They will because I'm going to give them
a vision of the future.

27:13.333 --> 27:14.625
With what?

27:15.375 --> 27:16.416
Hope.

27:28.708 --> 27:29.708
No.

No. No.

[The Incarnate]
He has broken his oath. Again.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.708
[The Executioner]
We cannot allow this to stand.

28:24.291 --> 28:25.291
No.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.666
So from here on,
we must continue to watch...
