WEBVTT

00:07.575 --> 00:08.942
[soft piano music]

00:09.843 --> 00:11.445
- I didn't know
it would last this long.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.581
I had no idea.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.117
- It's been so freeing
to create this world

00:16.216 --> 00:17.818
and to live in this world
for this long.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.520
*

00:19.620 --> 00:24.024
- It's just a really special
bond that we have.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.195
- We didn't have nearly
as large of a cast back then,

00:27.295 --> 00:30.364
so it was a much smaller
ragtag group of people

00:30.464 --> 00:32.433
who were there all the time.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.868
- It was just us in the woods

00:34.968 --> 00:37.238
as a family just kicking butt.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.541
- I wasn't really 100% sure

00:40.641 --> 00:44.645
how the general public
would take it.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.282
- We never dreamed
that there would be

00:48.382 --> 00:50.351
this kind of response
to this show.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.020
[cheers and applause]

00:53.121 --> 00:55.055
- 21 million people a week

00:55.156 --> 00:57.558
watching your show
at the height of it.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.861
- I thought that I would
be fine, prepared.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.996
I fucking was not.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.866
- Because it was like
jumping on a moving train.

01:05.966 --> 01:10.371
- You will not be able to talk
about the history of television

01:10.471 --> 01:14.074
without talking about
AMC's "The Walking Dead."

01:14.175 --> 01:15.909
- I love that I get to be
a part of something

01:16.009 --> 01:18.446
that meant so much to people.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.914
- For all the skepticism

01:22.015 --> 01:24.318
about whether a zombie show
could work on TV,

01:24.418 --> 01:26.053
it kind of blew everyone away

01:26.154 --> 01:29.056
as to what could be done
with the genre.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.459
It felt very special
from the beginning.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.662
- How do you bring
a story like this

01:34.762 --> 01:38.699
to a conclusion
that is worth the legacy

01:38.799 --> 01:40.601
of what this show is?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.170
- What do we want
to give people?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.737
Why have they been
with us this long?

01:43.837 --> 01:45.539
And how do we honor that?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.241
- The goal from the beginning
was, make it as big

01:47.341 --> 01:50.110
and make it as impressive
as we possibly can.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.045
- It's just gonna be
crazy, man.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.015
- Have I thought about the end?
Yeah.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.751
Kind of breaks my heart,
to be honest.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.387
- We're gonna see

01:59.487 --> 02:02.756
a bit of the OG
"Walking Dead" return.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.058
- Get ready.
It's gonna be bloody.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.426
[laughs]

02:06.527 --> 02:09.663
*

02:11.832 --> 02:12.900
- So we ready to roll?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.868
- I'll have you
introduce yourself,

02:14.968 --> 02:17.971
uh, and kind of tell me
what your job is on the show.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.307
- Hi. I'm Tom Luse.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.542
I'm an executive producer
on "The Walking Dead"

02:21.642 --> 02:23.043
and part of the producing team.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.878
- I'm Denise Huth,
and I'm one

02:24.978 --> 02:26.780
of the executive producers
on "The Walking Dead."

02:26.880 --> 02:28.282
- My name is Scott Gimple.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.752
I am the chief content officer
of "The Walking Dead" universe.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.221
- My name is Angela Kang,

02:33.321 --> 02:35.989
and I am the showrunner
of "The Walking Dead."

02:36.089 --> 02:37.758
- My name is
Gregory Paul Nicotero,

02:37.858 --> 02:39.460
March 15, 1963,

02:39.560 --> 02:41.295
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.897
- Yeah, I've been here
basically longer than anybody.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.300
[laughing]
So I know it all.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.837
[dramatic music]

02:49.937 --> 02:52.440
- For any of us that started
on the show early enough,

02:52.540 --> 02:55.609
I don't know that there were
very many people who were like,

02:55.709 --> 02:57.611
"This could totally become
a franchise."

02:57.711 --> 02:59.179
We were just like,
"Well, this is the show,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.915
"and we're gonna make
the best version of this show

03:02.015 --> 03:06.086
that we can for as long
as we're allowed to."

03:06.186 --> 03:08.922
- "The Walking Dead"
has always been

03:09.022 --> 03:10.791
the greatest summer camp
on Earth.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.527
That aspect of it,
of us being in Senoia,

03:13.627 --> 03:15.663
this lovely little town,

03:15.763 --> 03:19.533
just doing our thing
away from the world,

03:19.633 --> 03:22.436
there was a purity to that.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.204
- The expectations
at the beginning

03:24.305 --> 03:27.408
were not that we were gonna
become what we have become.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.278
- It's been interesting.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.179
I've done a lot
of zombie movies.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.482
I've never done
a zombie school.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.884
So I thought that it was
really good for me

03:36.984 --> 03:39.186
to be able to go through
and kind of handpick

03:39.287 --> 03:41.622
the people
that I really liked.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.724
For quite a while,
we had talked

03:43.824 --> 03:48.962
about the idea of doing
some sort of genre zombie show.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.063
And then, of course,

03:50.163 --> 03:51.332
"The Walking Dead"
comes along,

03:51.432 --> 03:52.966
the comic book.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.536
- We first got the rights
to the comic book

03:55.636 --> 03:57.204
way back in 2005

03:57.305 --> 04:00.408
and spent five years
trying to get it made.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.410
And so AMC finally said yes,

04:02.510 --> 04:06.614
and we were able to shoot
that first season in 2010.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.617
- Norman Reedus, take one.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.356
- There was so much care
and thought

04:15.456 --> 04:17.757
that went into that
original casting.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.427
You know,
I remember being there

04:19.527 --> 04:22.363
for when Andy came
and did a screen test

04:22.463 --> 04:23.831
and Bernthal and Sarah,

04:23.931 --> 04:26.400
and it just felt very special
from the beginning.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.336
It felt like this little
kernel of something

04:28.436 --> 04:30.704
that could be amazing
and we wanted to protect.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.005
- I won't do it.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.407
We can't just leave.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.843
- Carol, the group is split.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.578
We're scattered and weak.

04:37.678 --> 04:41.181
- What if she comes back
and we're not here?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.616
Could happen.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.952
- If Sophia found her way back
and we were gone,

04:45.052 --> 04:46.454
that would be awful.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.556
- I came to be
a part of the show

04:48.656 --> 04:50.558
having done a film
called "The Mist."

04:50.658 --> 04:53.193
And I think it was
three years later

04:53.293 --> 04:56.096
and totally unexpected.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.531
Got a phone call

04:57.631 --> 05:00.133
they had a role for me
in "The Walking Dead."

05:00.233 --> 05:03.437
I had no idea
what "The Walking Dead" was.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.072
I remember
going to the comic store

05:05.172 --> 05:06.807
to find out what it was,

05:06.907 --> 05:10.210
and I opened the book,
just some random page.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.879
And it was--
[growls]

05:11.979 --> 05:14.214
And I was like, "Oh, dear.
Oh, dear. Well, I don't know.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.384
What am I getting myself into?"

05:16.484 --> 05:18.251
- I read the pilot.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.153
It seemed super honest.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.790
I didn't really read zombies
into the pilot.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.825
I saw a man
trying to find his family

05:24.925 --> 05:26.727
and being confused
and worried.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.496
And it really struck with me.

05:28.596 --> 05:31.799
*

05:31.899 --> 05:32.900
- Dad!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.902
Getting cast on the show was

05:35.002 --> 05:37.337
pretty fast
and really exciting.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.440
They originally had said,
"We're gonna bring you out

05:39.540 --> 05:41.241
for a screen test
with Steven Yeun."

05:41.341 --> 05:42.576
And then, like, a day later,
they said,

05:42.676 --> 05:43.644
"Actually, we're gonna
fly you to Georgia

05:43.744 --> 05:45.546
and you're gonna
start filming."

05:46.714 --> 05:50.918
- It was just sort of
the perfect work atmosphere.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.853
And everybody was very excited

05:52.953 --> 05:54.655
'cause we were going
into an unknown.

05:54.755 --> 05:59.326
There wasn't a show
quite like "The Walking Dead."

05:59.427 --> 06:01.028
Nobody knew what was
going to become of it.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.598
We were aware that this
would be a six-episode pilot.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.367
We didn't know if we would have
another season.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.770
- There was no expectation
of a season two.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.640
So it sort of felt like,
do whatever we gotta do

06:12.740 --> 06:15.776
and just get through
those six episodes.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.379
- Our production budget
and our crew size was modest.

06:19.480 --> 06:24.518
We had very few resources
to make the show.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.388
What we had were
an amazingly dedicated team

06:28.489 --> 06:30.190
behind and in front
of the camera.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.659
- A variety
of different bloods.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.861
This is, like,
our zombie blood.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.196
We have dark zombie blood,
dressing blood,

06:36.296 --> 06:38.999
pumping blood,
dark pumping blood,

06:39.099 --> 06:41.969
mouth blood,
zombie mouth blood.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.837
I think six different kinds
of blood?

06:43.937 --> 06:45.138
Something like that, yeah.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.374
- We shot
on 16 millimeter film.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.911
We did almost all
of our effects in camera

06:51.011 --> 06:54.715
and kind of embraced
an old-school horror mentality

06:54.815 --> 06:59.252
that got me very excited
about new ways of filmmaking.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.188
- Ooh. There we go.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.322
You know, it felt like

07:02.422 --> 07:04.024
a little feature,
to be honest.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.092
It felt like a movie.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.894
Who are these people?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.896
It was the first thing
I'd done

07:08.996 --> 07:11.398
with a group of actors

07:11.499 --> 07:13.333
that were 100% behind you.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.936
Everybody was in it to win it,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.738
and it was a family.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.941
- That whole ensemble feel

07:21.041 --> 07:23.677
was really laid down

07:23.777 --> 07:26.780
really nicely by Andy Lincoln.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.782
- He was like a superb leader.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.519
- I want to make this
as real, as harrowing,

07:31.619 --> 07:35.923
as raw, and as exciting
as I can possibly do.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.258
I'm gonna give it my all.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.793
- Everybody really bonded
like that.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.361
You know, we were
away from Hollywood,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.631
away from our families.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.098
We were out here in the woods.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.167
It was just kind of
our little bubble.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.071
- It's sort of the lure
of the show,

07:51.171 --> 07:53.106
how the cast
in those first few seasons--

07:53.206 --> 07:54.575
you know, they never
went to their trailers.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.808
They never weren't on set.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.210
It's just they came to set
in the mornings,

07:57.310 --> 07:58.612
and that's where they were.

07:58.712 --> 08:02.415
- This is a segment
called Hugs for Free.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.751
- No, no, no.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.819
- It felt very--almost
student-film-ish in a way,

08:05.919 --> 08:07.387
but we had a better
budget than that.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.656
[all exclaim]

08:08.756 --> 08:09.790
I mean, not great, but better.

08:09.890 --> 08:13.293
- Episode two in the can.
- Yay!

08:13.393 --> 08:14.662
- A lot of people
initially were like,

08:14.762 --> 08:15.996
"Oh, yeah, I don't really--

08:16.096 --> 08:17.097
"it's a zombie show.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.599
It's not really my thing."

08:18.699 --> 08:19.933
And then word of mouth
came out,

08:20.033 --> 08:22.970
and people would say,
"It's not a zombie show.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.471
"There are zombies in it,

08:24.572 --> 08:27.307
"but that's not
what it's about.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.776
This is a story
about survival.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.944
This is a story
about people banding together

08:31.044 --> 08:33.346
to fight against
a greater common enemy.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.816
And that's how we fell
in love with Daryl,

08:35.915 --> 08:39.352
you fell in love with Carol,
you fell in love with Maggie,

08:39.452 --> 08:41.054
you fell in love with Rick.

08:41.154 --> 08:46.359
And that's when the show began
to gain a lot of momentum.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.663
It was pretty fascinating
what we were able to do.

08:49.763 --> 08:54.635
The fact that we were changing
the rules of television

08:54.735 --> 08:57.337
and changing the rules
of genre storytelling.

08:57.437 --> 09:01.008
I really do feel that
"Walking Dead's" footprint

09:01.108 --> 09:04.511
has been emulated
in so many shows since then,

09:04.612 --> 09:05.779
because up to that point,

09:05.879 --> 09:08.081
we'd never seen
anything like it on TV.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.351
- I remember
early on thinking,

09:11.451 --> 09:14.755
"This is
absolutely phenomenal."

09:16.056 --> 09:19.760
Suddenly, people know who I am.

09:21.294 --> 09:26.433
And you realize
this is kind of a big deal.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.538
- There was definitely
a moment

09:31.639 --> 09:35.242
when it felt a bit overwhelming
that it had gotten so popular,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.210
and I remember
Steven and I talking about it

09:37.310 --> 09:42.182
and kind of trying to find
a way to process that--

09:43.817 --> 09:45.753
That you were
that interesting to people.

09:45.853 --> 09:49.089
- You know, the thing
about the fandom

09:49.189 --> 09:52.059
and the popularity of the show,

09:52.159 --> 09:54.895
we didn't really feel it
till, like, season three

09:54.995 --> 09:58.398
or four
because we were out here.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.367
We were so deep in it
that we didn't

10:00.467 --> 10:02.502
really see the outside world.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.404
- It's pretty incredible
to be a part

10:04.504 --> 10:07.407
of something that becomes
a worldwide phenomenon.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.243
I feel so fortunate
to have been

10:10.343 --> 10:12.079
a part of putting
something together

10:12.179 --> 10:14.281
that resonated
as much as this did.

10:14.381 --> 10:18.418
[cheers and applause]

10:18.518 --> 10:20.020
- It wasn't like
we went to those fan events

10:20.120 --> 10:21.521
and there was, like, 10 people,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.590
and then 100 people,
and 1,000 people.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.893
We just went to them
and there was 10,000 people,

10:25.993 --> 10:27.194
like, right off the bat.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.461
And it was like that
everywhere.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.731
There were drones
being flown around here,

10:30.831 --> 10:32.099
people trying to spy.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.067
There were people
hiding in the woods.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.369
- I've never had an experience
where I've gone somewhere

10:36.469 --> 10:38.038
or somebody's noticed
or said anything

10:38.138 --> 10:40.073
when it hasn't been
an emotional connection

10:40.173 --> 10:41.374
with a fan.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.778
And--and I just thought, "Yeah,

10:44.878 --> 10:47.080
because that's how we feel
when we make it."

10:52.152 --> 10:54.988
[dramatic music]

10:55.088 --> 10:58.625
*

10:58.726 --> 11:01.061
- The thing that's interesting
right now

11:01.161 --> 11:04.297
in terms of making people
realize is,

11:04.397 --> 11:07.000
is that, you know,
we're officially in prep

11:07.100 --> 11:09.602
for the last episode.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.271
It's not just an episode.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.606
- Walkers, everybody--
stunt walkers,

11:13.707 --> 11:16.744
everybody's gotta be
full performance every time.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.511
No sleeping walkers.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.748
Every time, it's gotta be
spot on, right?

11:25.052 --> 11:25.753
- So am I looking into--

11:26.286 --> 11:27.420
- You look at me.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.521
- Look at you? Great.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.123
- Well,
they're also prescription.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.491
[laughs]
- Are they?

11:31.591 --> 11:33.160
- I can--I'll take them off
at some point.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.995
How about that?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.164
- So how much of me
can you see?

11:37.264 --> 11:38.331
Waist up?

11:38.431 --> 11:41.468
- My white socks.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.136
- So you can see my socks?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.371
- White socks.
- Hold on. Let's cut.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.839
- Yeah.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.308
- You should sit over there,
because that way,

11:48.408 --> 11:50.343
if I say something bad,
I can see Brandy

11:50.443 --> 11:52.512
over your shoulder going--

11:52.612 --> 11:54.314
- Yeah, I feel like
I should be--

11:54.414 --> 11:56.049
I should be here, though.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.151
I should be like,
"I can't believe it's over."

11:58.251 --> 11:59.519
[dramatic music]

11:59.619 --> 12:01.989
- My name is Ross Marquand,
and I play Aaron.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.724
- Hi, I'm Seth Gilliam,
and I play Father Gabriel.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.194
- I'm Josh McDermitt.
I play Eugene.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.196
- Hi. I'm Khary Payton.
I play King Ezekiel.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.232
- My name is Cailey Fleming,
and I play Judith Grimes.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.901
- Hi. I'm Lauren Ridloff.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.536
I play Connie
on "The Walking Dead."

12:16.636 --> 12:21.074
*

12:21.174 --> 12:22.843
- The experience
getting cast on the show,

12:22.943 --> 12:24.011
for me, was life-changing.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.678
- It was pretty surreal.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.616
- Fans came up to me and said,
"You should be Negan."

12:30.750 --> 12:34.087
It was maybe
the most exhilarating work

12:34.187 --> 12:36.423
I think I'd ever done
up to that point.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.260
- I was a bit intimidated
coming here

12:40.360 --> 12:42.429
with an ensemble cast
who had been doing this

12:42.529 --> 12:45.966
and had made such a name
for themselves.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.103
- Very intimidating coming
into a show that you love.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.572
You don't want to be the one
who screws it up.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.608
- It was kind of like,
"Here's the script, dude.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.211
Don't screw this up," you know?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.779
- But we'd all tell you
the same thing.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.815
We were welcomed right away.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.352
- You know, Andy gave me
some shit initially.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.220
But it was very good-natured.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.289
- [giggling]

13:09.389 --> 13:12.392
My first day on set,
I was just blown away

13:12.492 --> 13:14.061
about how kind they were.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.964
They were so welcoming
and accepting of me.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.265
- Hi.
- I'm Andy. What's your name?

13:18.365 --> 13:19.867
- Addie.
- Addie.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.403
- Andy Lincoln came
on a day off just to greet us.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.306
Who's done that for me
before in my career?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.807
Nobody.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.277
- Before I even got on a plane
to fly out to Georgia,

13:30.377 --> 13:33.646
Steven Yeun was emailing me
saying, "Hey, here's my number.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.882
"Let's hang out, let's"--

13:34.982 --> 13:36.383
you know,
"Welcome to the show.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.985
I'm excited
to be working with you."

13:38.085 --> 13:39.752
That really set the tone.

13:39.853 --> 13:43.556
- When you're coming
into such a crazy environment,

13:43.656 --> 13:45.225
it's such a nice thing to do.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.660
I want to do that
for people in my career.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.630
[indistinct chatter]

13:50.730 --> 13:54.334
*

13:54.434 --> 13:55.602
- This was
a really tricky year.

13:55.702 --> 13:56.769
It's been
a really tricky two years

13:56.870 --> 13:58.271
for the entire world.

13:58.371 --> 14:02.175
And our writers were already
well at work

14:02.275 --> 14:07.147
in the room in January,
February, March of 2020.

14:07.247 --> 14:12.085
- Our usual schedule, we start
the writers room in January.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.287
And then, you know, we work
for a certain number of weeks,

14:14.387 --> 14:18.825
and then we pitch AMC the--
our plans for the season,

14:18.926 --> 14:21.494
and then we start writing,
and then we start shooting

14:21.594 --> 14:24.998
somewhere around the end
of April, beginning of May.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.833
- We had actually
just had a pitch,

14:26.934 --> 14:28.801
what we thought was gonna be
a traditional season 11

14:28.902 --> 14:30.470
of 16 episodes.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.039
And then the pandemic hit.

14:34.641 --> 14:38.445
- At that time,
we were already in pre-prep.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.647
Like, sets were being built,

14:40.747 --> 14:43.116
department heads were
getting ready to travel,

14:43.216 --> 14:44.684
like, all of that
kind of stuff.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.320
It became apparent
that this wasn't,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.489
like, gonna be
a four-week thing,

14:49.589 --> 14:52.659
where we pause and then we got
back up and running.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.064
We were just starting
to understand

14:57.164 --> 15:00.867
it was going to be
very hard to produce

15:00.968 --> 15:02.869
the episodes that we
initially had planned

15:02.970 --> 15:05.138
for the start of season 11.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.140
But we were
one of the early shows

15:07.240 --> 15:09.376
that started producing again.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.578
Really, not very many people
were able

15:11.678 --> 15:14.481
to get up and running
very quickly in 2020

15:14.581 --> 15:18.085
because there were
all these health protocols

15:18.185 --> 15:19.919
that had to be figured out.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.189
It was
this huge learning curve.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.557
- I got you.
- Thank you so much.

15:24.657 --> 15:30.363
*

15:31.798 --> 15:33.400
- I honestly thought
this show was gonna

15:33.500 --> 15:35.402
keep going for a while.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.537
- One,
I think more than anything,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.572
it was a shock.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.175
- I kind of had
a wave of panic.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.610
I was like, "Wait, wait, wait,

15:43.710 --> 15:45.078
"I'm never going back there
again?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.279
What are you talking about?"

15:46.379 --> 15:47.580
I don't know.
It's just--it's surreal.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.282
I haven't really accepted
that it's over,

15:49.382 --> 15:51.384
I don't think, to be honest.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.020
- And then we got
this phone call saying,

15:53.120 --> 15:58.625
"Hey, so we're gonna do
24 episodes."

15:58.725 --> 16:00.927
And of course,
first thing I thought about is,

16:01.028 --> 16:04.631
"Holy shit, like, shooting
16 episodes almost kills us.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.466
How are we gonna
shoot 24 episodes?"

16:06.566 --> 16:10.570
I mean, this is not
a courtroom drama.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.272
This show is hardcore.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.274
- It's like every episode,
we approach it

16:14.374 --> 16:16.643
like it's its own
little indie movie.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.811
I think for everybody,
just the idea

16:18.911 --> 16:22.382
of how do we produce this
in the time that we have

16:22.482 --> 16:25.318
with the restrictions
that we have?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.320
- How do you bring
a story like this

16:27.420 --> 16:31.058
to a conclusion
that is worth the legacy

16:31.158 --> 16:33.493
of what this show is?

16:33.593 --> 16:37.397
- This is
a very widespread story

16:37.497 --> 16:41.234
with literally dozens
of well-known characters

16:41.334 --> 16:43.836
that we all have to--
you have to pay off.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.174
And that is--
that's a very difficult,

16:47.274 --> 16:48.641
very difficult thing to do.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.410
- People are getting
used to it.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.644
- What I'll say is that, like,

16:51.744 --> 16:53.246
I know that every person
in this room

16:53.346 --> 16:55.014
was like, "Oh, shit,
we have to end the series.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.250
Like, let us not fuck this up."
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.253
- Angela Kang and the writers
really had to,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.489
you know, drop whole things
that they had been working on

17:02.589 --> 17:05.325
to shift gears
to do more episodes

17:05.425 --> 17:07.493
to get us into the 24 episodes
of season 11.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.828
Oh, and by the way,
you also have to wrap up

17:08.928 --> 17:10.163
the whole show.

17:10.262 --> 17:16.868
*

17:16.969 --> 17:18.338
- This is the end
of the series,

17:18.438 --> 17:19.705
so we have to, like--

17:19.806 --> 17:23.276
you've gotta raise
those stakes in a way

17:23.376 --> 17:25.444
that, like, elevates it
to the point

17:25.545 --> 17:27.980
where these are the rides
we're gonna take you on.

17:28.080 --> 17:31.718
- It's like a story
of, like, the gut, the heart.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.188
You're dealing with, like,
almost, like, the bureaucracy

17:35.288 --> 17:37.390
and the institution itself

17:37.490 --> 17:41.027
as being the enemy
of human progress

17:41.128 --> 17:43.830
and, like, how people
with good intentions

17:43.930 --> 17:46.133
can still build something evil.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.168
- I don't think
the Commonwealth thinks

17:48.268 --> 17:49.469
they're evil,

17:49.569 --> 17:52.004
given what's happened
all around them.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.407
- In all societies where
there's, like, a figurehead

17:54.507 --> 17:56.243
and they have all the power,

17:56.343 --> 17:59.312
ultimately that power
will corrupt.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.481
- So how do you still
ground that down

18:01.581 --> 18:03.550
in the visceral sort of thing

18:03.650 --> 18:04.817
that makes it
"The Walking Dead"?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.319
- We know that there's
still a contingent

18:06.419 --> 18:11.090
of our people in Commonwealth
that are in imminent danger.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.260
- Well, the alternative is,
you go out into the wasteland

18:13.360 --> 18:14.427
and you eat worms.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.597
The alternative
is literally hell.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.199
- Yeah.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.934
- It's teeing up what becomes
a do-or-die kind of situation.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.773
[soft music]

18:26.873 --> 18:29.909
*

18:30.009 --> 18:33.880
- There's a big statement
being made this season.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.216
It's not really
what we're used to.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.084
It's something
we've fallen on.

18:38.185 --> 18:41.454
And then the writers themselves
are telling a story

18:41.554 --> 18:44.524
of equality and social justice.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
- I feel like
through the apocalypse,

18:46.726 --> 18:50.463
we rediscover what is
really important to us.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.366
And then we have
to reenter society.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.403
And that is the Commonwealth.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.572
And we face the threat

18:59.672 --> 19:02.542
of losing ourselves once again.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.378
So the battle is really about

19:13.019 --> 19:13.953
[soft dramatic music]

19:14.654 --> 19:17.257
- You've fallen on hard times.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.758
And that is where
the Commonwealth

19:18.858 --> 19:21.661
is more than willing to help.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.564
If you remain, we can provide
labor and materials

19:24.664 --> 19:27.200
to help you build back
all you've lost.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.770
However,

19:30.870 --> 19:34.006
if any are interested,

19:34.106 --> 19:36.443
I do have another,

19:36.543 --> 19:40.313
potentially more interesting
choice to offer.

19:40.413 --> 19:44.517
*

19:44.617 --> 19:47.587
- This whole season
feels like an escalation

19:47.687 --> 19:49.256
across the board.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.492
Now we're at a place where
we have multiple communities.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.160
And we introduced
Commonwealth this year,

19:54.261 --> 19:56.663
which is by far
the most advanced community

19:56.763 --> 19:58.798
we've ever seen
in the history of the show.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.667
You know, it's a community
of 50,000 people.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.101
It's the closest thing

20:02.201 --> 20:03.770
to what the world
used to look like

20:03.870 --> 20:05.204
that we've ever seen.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.907
And that was a huge undertaking
for the production crew.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.810
- My name's Roger Scruggs.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.345
I'm the construction
coordinator.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.181
- Mike Sullivan,
and I'm the scenic charge.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.449
- I'm Gia Grosso.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.850
I'm the set decorator.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.118
- I'm Vera Chow.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.787
I'm the costume designer
of this season

20:20.887 --> 20:22.889
of "The Walking Dead."

20:22.989 --> 20:24.123
- It's been huge.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.358
We've had big builds

20:25.458 --> 20:27.226
pretty much every episode
this year.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.995
It's been really ambitious.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.364
Everything that's in there
in the square,

20:31.464 --> 20:34.534
the Commonwealth square,
we built this year.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.135
- They'll design the set.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.704
They'll come to me and say,

20:37.804 --> 20:39.506
"This is the kind of look
that I'd like."

20:39.606 --> 20:41.408
And then we just
have to run with it.

20:41.508 --> 20:44.411
The first big set that we did
was the Commonwealth.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.614
We had no idea how large
it was going to be.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.919
- The Commonwealth is
the biggest community

20:53.019 --> 20:54.387
that they've been in
in the show,

20:54.487 --> 20:59.326
and though it has a really
dark underbelly to it,

20:59.426 --> 21:01.761
it's a community that--

21:01.861 --> 21:03.530
that is successful.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.164
This place,

21:05.264 --> 21:06.699
compared to any other place
they've been,

21:06.799 --> 21:11.338
is so shiny and nice and safe

21:11.438 --> 21:13.906
that the place in and of itself

21:14.006 --> 21:16.576
made our characters
into aliens.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.779
- You kind of walk into it
and you're like, what is this?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.881
Yeah, people in the outfits
walking around

21:21.981 --> 21:23.450
eating cotton candy and stuff,

21:23.550 --> 21:26.085
which is definitely different
than what we're used to.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.520
You're like, where are we?

21:27.620 --> 21:31.624
You're like, are we being
punked, like, you know?

21:31.724 --> 21:36.596
And I think it plays on my face
in all the scenes there.

21:36.696 --> 21:40.467
- What I do in my department,
my crew, is,

21:40.567 --> 21:43.970
we handle all the set dressing.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.774
For instance, this sofa
would be in our realm.

21:47.874 --> 21:51.110
*

21:51.210 --> 21:54.614
We had a great time
doing the Commonwealth town

21:54.714 --> 21:57.784
because it's a mix
of found things.

21:57.884 --> 22:02.121
And the little bit
that they do manufacture,

22:02.221 --> 22:05.425
paper goods and you see a lot
of fabrics,

22:05.525 --> 22:08.561
it was really fun
to make the shops

22:08.661 --> 22:10.797
using all of those elements.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.799
There's a lot of weird shit
in those shops.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.067
[laughs]

22:15.167 --> 22:17.504
- We've gone
from "The Walking Dead"

22:17.604 --> 22:19.672
back to the living people.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.074
It's kind of like
they're in a community

22:22.174 --> 22:24.844
where they're not out
in the wild all the time.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.946
They have running water.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.515
They clean their hands
every day.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.651
- I was aware
of the introduction

22:31.751 --> 22:34.320
of the Commonwealth,
like, brand-new villains.

22:34.421 --> 22:38.991
So it was a chance
to really change things up

22:39.091 --> 22:40.593
and elevate it.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.330
So we started thinking
about what kind of technology

22:44.431 --> 22:46.433
would actually exist
in the Commonwealth.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.034
And there's, like, no rules

22:48.134 --> 22:50.837
in terms of what decade
we're in.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.705
It's not
our actual present day.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.707
So how has fashion evolved?

22:54.807 --> 22:57.677
How has clothing
and sewing evolved

22:57.777 --> 22:59.612
in this little town
of 50,000 people?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.648
It's entirely up to me.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.249
So that was fun.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.386
- It's been
such a massive transition.

23:07.487 --> 23:10.623
And there's not been
a slow progression in that.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.192
We really shove our characters

23:13.292 --> 23:17.497
into quite drastic changes
this season.

23:18.665 --> 23:22.201
- I think our group is
too smart to be fooled by it,

23:22.301 --> 23:23.736
to be honest.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.806
And so we're kind of
reluctantly pulled into it

23:26.906 --> 23:28.541
because we want safety
for our kids.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.342
We want them to have
a better life.

23:30.443 --> 23:33.446
And then it sort of
unravels around us.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.916
- There's a direct clash,
I think,

23:37.016 --> 23:40.219
for people on the outside
and people on the inside.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.922
And there's an unrest inside
the Commonwealth as well,

23:43.022 --> 23:45.324
and all of that is building up.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.694
- The leader is
kind of a dictator,

23:47.794 --> 23:49.596
and she's lying to everybody.

23:49.696 --> 23:53.032
And they're just now opening
their eyes to it, I guess.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.703
- What's exciting is,
Mercer has finally come around

23:56.803 --> 23:59.271
and was able to rescue Eugene.

23:59.371 --> 24:02.441
And now we're gonna see
what comes of that.

24:02.542 --> 24:06.178
- After having had Hershel
kidnapped by Pamela,

24:14.320 --> 24:17.156
[indistinct chatter]

24:18.658 --> 24:21.027
- The scale of what
we're trying to accomplish

24:21.127 --> 24:25.097
for this finale
and building up to the finale

24:25.197 --> 24:26.866
is remarkable.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.637
And I think
the scale of everything

24:30.737 --> 24:34.473
is going to be a bit bigger,
a bit bolder,

24:34.574 --> 24:36.475
and a bit more surprising.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.977
- All right,
here we go, team.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.311
Ready?

24:39.411 --> 24:40.412
All right,
let's see what happens.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.148
- We owe it to our fans

24:42.248 --> 24:44.283
and the legacy of this show

24:44.383 --> 24:47.319
to have a--lack of a better way
to say it,

24:47.419 --> 24:49.321
a thrilling conclusion
to "The Walking Dead."

24:49.421 --> 24:50.623
And we're gonna do that.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.258
- Mark.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.097
- I've never been on a show

24:58.197 --> 25:01.300
that has this many
enormous sets.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.069
And just trying
to get sets done

25:03.169 --> 25:07.006
with the time frame
of a episodic TV show,

25:07.106 --> 25:08.808
the challenge is
what I really like.

25:08.908 --> 25:12.444
[dramatic music]

25:12.545 --> 25:15.815
- When I read a script,
I do get really excited

25:15.915 --> 25:19.118
when there is
maybe a new scenario

25:19.218 --> 25:20.987
we haven't done before.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.790
I'd say one of the first ones
that interested me

25:23.890 --> 25:25.958
was our subway tunnels.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.196
To create
an apocalyptic subway tunnel

25:30.296 --> 25:34.000
was really a challenge
that we all really welcomed.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.737
We just knew it was
going to be so fantastic.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.607
- One of the big highlights
this season,

25:40.707 --> 25:42.842
they built a 50,000-gallon
water tank,

25:42.942 --> 25:45.044
and we filmed in it,
and it was the flooded basement

25:45.144 --> 25:47.346
of Aaron's house.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.515
We have--Judith and Gracie
are trapped down there

25:49.616 --> 25:51.651
being attacked by walkers
who are in the water.

25:51.751 --> 25:54.220
Aaron's jumping in
and smashing their heads in

25:54.320 --> 25:55.822
with his mace hand.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.457
And it's just--it is wild
to shoot in those conditions.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.660
I'd never been able to do
anything like that.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.394
- Thank you.

26:02.494 --> 26:05.898
- We've had quite a few
sequences like that this year,

26:05.998 --> 26:09.736
and they've kind of, you know,
taken up the scale of things

26:09.836 --> 26:11.604
just a bit, those writers have.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.908
- Episode nine,
we had the hwacha,

26:16.008 --> 26:18.010
which just fires
rocket arrows out

26:18.110 --> 26:20.747
as, like, a ballistic missile.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.481
And they're firing into a herd,

26:22.581 --> 26:24.150
and they're exploding
and blowing up,

26:24.250 --> 26:28.320
and the rockets hit the walker,

26:28.420 --> 26:29.555
shooting out sparks,

26:29.656 --> 26:32.224
and then they explode
into a million pieces.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.026
And there were
so many elements

26:34.126 --> 26:35.327
we had to come up with.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.229
- I built a couple prototypes.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.199
Effects built
the working model,

26:40.299 --> 26:42.468
because mine would have caught
on fire.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.005
[phone vibrating]

26:46.105 --> 26:47.640
- Excuse me.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.244
I have to take this. Sorry.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.413
Hello?

26:54.513 --> 26:57.516
Everybody is at the top
of their game

26:57.616 --> 27:01.020
and experts in their field
in each and every department.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.454
I'm talking greens.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.624
I'm talking art department,
crafty.

27:05.725 --> 27:09.261
And sometimes when I don't
necessarily have to be on set,

27:09.361 --> 27:11.798
I'll come on set
just to watch them

27:11.898 --> 27:14.266
because it's so impressive.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.635
- Just tell me your name
and what you do on the show.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.637
- Taylor Knight.
I'm the hair department head.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.207
- Brad Carey,
and I'm the key greens person.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.909
- Geoffrey January.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.443
First assistant director.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.813
- I'm Jody Winslette.
I'm the transpo captain.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.148
- Bryan Carey.
I'm the greens foreman.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.582
- Vincent Gideon.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.786
I am the key hair department
for "The Walking Dead."

27:33.886 --> 27:36.789
[intense music]

27:36.889 --> 27:41.761
*

27:41.861 --> 27:44.163
- It's been a challenging
season, without a doubt.

27:44.263 --> 27:47.800
But the only way
that it has survived

27:47.900 --> 27:50.169
is because the passion
of the crew and the cast.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.670
- A couple more times.
- Is that good?

27:51.771 --> 27:54.440
- I need to see four more tests
before I'm comfortable with it.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.644
- Shooting "The Walking Dead"
is like playing chess.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.180
It's a very complicated show
to make.

28:01.280 --> 28:05.451
We have visual effects
and special effects and stunts.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.287
- [screaming]

28:08.387 --> 28:11.357
- The glamour
of "The Walking Dead"?

28:11.457 --> 28:13.826
There is no glamour
of "The Walking Dead"

28:13.926 --> 28:15.795
while you're shooting
"The Walking Dead," you know?

28:15.895 --> 28:18.765
It's like go, go, go!

28:18.865 --> 28:21.167
Oh, it's hot?
Well, yeah, it's hot.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.769
Oh, there are mosquitoes?
There are ticks?

28:22.869 --> 28:24.336
Yeah, there are mosquitoes
and ticks.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.772
- Bug spray on the tracks.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.674
- And honestly, when I'm away,
I feel guilty

28:28.775 --> 28:31.844
because I know that my crew
is out here busting their ass.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.379
And I want to be out here,

28:33.479 --> 28:35.314
you know,
feeling it with them.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.449
The truth is,
we make magic in eight days.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.985
And if you do it
with people you love,

28:39.085 --> 28:40.352
it's actually worth it.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.355
[dramatic music]

28:43.455 --> 28:46.125
*

28:46.225 --> 28:48.527
- This show makes you
uncomfortable.

28:48.627 --> 28:51.363
But I think it helps for what
you guys see on the screen.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.165
You feel
that uncomfortableness,

28:53.265 --> 28:54.466
and that plays

28:54.566 --> 28:56.702
because we're in
the middle of an apocalypse.

28:56.803 --> 29:00.907
Those of us that have been here
longer than a year are insane.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.710
- I've been in awe
of the people

29:04.811 --> 29:08.014
that I've collaborated with
over the last 12 years

29:08.114 --> 29:10.549
of making something
that's been amazing.

29:10.649 --> 29:14.486
And we continue
that dedication

29:14.586 --> 29:17.723
and that passion all the way
through to the last ring.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.692
- We are gonna work
our asses off until then,

29:20.793 --> 29:24.396
and then we're gonna have
a lot of tequila.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.332
[laughs]

29:30.837 --> 29:31.703
[dramatic music]

29:32.872 --> 29:35.374
- Anything that happens
from the moment we shoot it,

29:35.474 --> 29:40.012
we'll take in 40, 50, 60 hours
worth of material sometimes.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.914
Once we take that footage in,

29:42.014 --> 29:45.284
our assistant editors digitize
that footage for the editors,

29:45.384 --> 29:47.887
put it into the machines,
kind of put it into order,

29:47.987 --> 29:49.822
and get it ready
to be worked on.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.627
- I'm Megan.
I'm the VFX coordinator.

29:55.727 --> 29:58.297
- I'm Mike, the VFX editor.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.632
- I'm Alan Cody,
and I'm the editor.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.635
- I am Ryan DeGard.
I am the post producer.

30:04.703 --> 30:07.106
- There's some fun stuff
in post.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.475
And I think a lot of times,
people think,

30:09.575 --> 30:11.277
like, "Oh, like,
it's done shooting."

30:11.377 --> 30:12.778
Like, you must all
be on a break."

30:12.879 --> 30:14.981
And I'm like, "No,
production is on a break."

30:15.081 --> 30:16.949
[walkers snarling]

30:17.049 --> 30:18.617
There's an entire
post-production process

30:18.717 --> 30:21.420
that's happening
that goes on for months

30:21.520 --> 30:23.122
and months and months.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.925
- I think that's
one of the misconceptions

30:26.025 --> 30:28.895
of, you know--just in general
with television and movies.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.262
It's like,
as soon as you've shot it,

30:30.362 --> 30:32.664
why isn't it ready
for us to watch it?

30:32.764 --> 30:35.567
So it's like, you have to go
through these processes,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.003
and they take a lot of time.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.505
And the post process
consists of editing,

30:39.605 --> 30:42.975
sound, visual effects, mixing.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.776
And we kind of put
that whole thing together

30:44.877 --> 30:48.014
in the post process and,
you know, condense that down

30:48.114 --> 30:50.416
into something that we put
out to the public.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.919
- I'm Jamie.
I'm the VFX producer.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.153
Our show has a lot of killing,

30:54.253 --> 30:56.255
especially of zombies.

30:56.355 --> 31:00.459
And each actor has kind of
their own, like, hero weapon.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.794
And if we see that green end
when we're watching,

31:02.895 --> 31:04.096
we know,
"Okay, we're gonna need

31:04.196 --> 31:05.831
to extend the length of it."

31:05.932 --> 31:07.333
And then we'll kind of take

31:07.433 --> 31:09.969
that second half
that we're building

31:10.069 --> 31:12.438
and be able to swing it
through the actor's head

31:12.538 --> 31:15.807
and add the blood
and all of the fun stuff.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.376
- So all of those things
happen.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.211
There's an entire mix process.

31:19.311 --> 31:23.015
And our post producer does
an incredible amount of work

31:23.115 --> 31:26.052
with the people that do ADR
and loop group

31:26.152 --> 31:28.187
and add
all the background noises.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.555
- Let's do these three
right here,

31:29.655 --> 31:31.123
and then we'll
move them in there.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.324
- Get down!

31:32.424 --> 31:36.628
- [grunting]

31:36.728 --> 31:38.564
- As far as sound goes,
this show is,

31:38.664 --> 31:41.067
you know,
built on sound, really.

31:41.167 --> 31:44.503
I mean, there's just a lot
of layers to what we do.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.572
- It is a zombie show.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.408
We take a lot of pride
in the artistry

31:49.508 --> 31:50.909
that goes into the zombies.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.844
We work really hard
to think about the zombies.

31:52.945 --> 31:56.082
- Here we go.
[all snarling]

32:01.787 --> 32:03.855
- There's just
some incredible work

32:03.956 --> 32:07.326
that they all do
that's on screen.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.095
- The last music spot
on "The Walking Dead."

32:09.195 --> 32:11.430
- I know!

32:11.530 --> 32:15.367
- God, shed a tear,
and here we go.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.037
- I love working
with our composers.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.439
Bear and Sam are just--

32:20.539 --> 32:21.740
they are the best.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.243
They are so story-driven.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.778
They really, like,
are thinking it through

32:26.878 --> 32:28.780
in terms of, like,
what is the story

32:28.880 --> 32:29.948
we're trying to tell?

32:30.049 --> 32:32.451
- Coming out
of the previous episode,

32:32.551 --> 32:34.520
it will have been emotional,
I think.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.423
To some degree, we can just,
like, carry that over.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.125
- I agree, but it's like--

32:39.225 --> 32:40.726
I think what you're suggesting
is what I wanted,

32:40.826 --> 32:43.195
which is to start that
more noticeably

32:43.295 --> 32:45.197
the instant [...] passes out...

32:45.297 --> 32:46.398
- Yeah.
- Right.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.634
- so that that's all
part of the piece.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.269
- We talk about every scene

32:50.369 --> 32:52.038
and we talk about
the episode as a whole

32:52.138 --> 32:53.939
and we talk about, like,
what are themes

32:54.040 --> 32:55.774
that we're trying
to get across?

32:55.874 --> 32:58.044
Like, what are the emotions
of this scene?

32:58.144 --> 33:00.046
And once we have
that conversation,

33:00.146 --> 33:02.448
they go off
and they play with it.

33:02.548 --> 33:03.782
They imagine.

33:03.882 --> 33:06.252
They come up with themes.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.054
It really just adds
to the experience.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.322
- Are we still
planning on recording

33:10.422 --> 33:12.958
the main title theme
with the live orchestra

33:13.059 --> 33:14.060
as well?

33:14.160 --> 33:15.561
I would love to do that.

33:15.661 --> 33:16.895
- I mean,
let me put it this way.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.830
- That'd be rad.
- It doesn't need it.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.399
It doesn't want it.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.734
But we'll do it
because it will look awesome.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.303
[laughter]

33:24.403 --> 33:28.574
- This idea of having Bear
and Sam use a live orchestra

33:28.674 --> 33:30.776
had been kind of percolating
for a while for me.

33:30.876 --> 33:34.012
And I'd been kind of thinking
about it in the background.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.614
It's a big moment
for the show.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.349
And when you have
a live orchestra,

33:37.449 --> 33:38.917
it's big, right?
It's epic.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.987
So, like, the idea that Bear
and Sam are gonna deliver

33:42.088 --> 33:44.756
this music in a way
that we've never experienced

33:44.856 --> 33:47.025
really on this show,
it's exciting.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.694
- Some of the stuff
they're composing

33:48.794 --> 33:50.662
that hasn't aired yet,
it's just--it's epic.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.298
It's amazing.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.032
Like, I think people will
really, really enjoy

33:54.133 --> 33:56.302
the soundscape
of these episodes.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.038
[flute playing]
- Welcome.

34:00.139 --> 34:03.008
This particular episode,
we wanted to send out the show

34:03.109 --> 34:04.676
on an even bigger note.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.545
So everybody on the show
is excited

34:06.645 --> 34:08.380
to bring in the winds
and the brass

34:08.480 --> 34:11.150
and just do something
even bigger than normal.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.319
So just really want to say
thank you to them

34:13.418 --> 34:16.054
for letting us
do this tonight.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.857
And thank you all
for being here.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.393
Okay, bows up. Bar two.

34:26.797 --> 34:30.402
["The Walking Dead"
theme playing]

34:30.502 --> 34:32.271
- It's truly, truly a process

34:32.371 --> 34:35.706
that hundreds of people
from start to finish

34:35.806 --> 34:37.176
are working on.

34:38.744 --> 34:43.014
It's so fun to get to be
part of all of that.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.984
But just the amount of work
that people put in

34:46.083 --> 34:48.820
to, like, really craft
every episode

34:55.594 --> 34:56.695
- I'm trying to get
your kit pretty much

34:57.529 --> 34:58.897
in the same direction
of the lens.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.199
So you're like--

35:00.299 --> 35:03.335
- All right, here we go.
Let's try one.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.405
Here we go.
Let's roll, please.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.240
- The nature of the show

35:08.340 --> 35:09.875
and being an actor
on this show,

35:09.975 --> 35:12.578
you always sort of feel like
the axe is about to drop on you

35:12.678 --> 35:14.045
at any second.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.614
- Shoot yourself back
just a tiny bit.

35:15.714 --> 35:16.882
By, like--
- Like that?

35:16.982 --> 35:18.584
- Yeah, perfect.
Thank you.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.453
- I always answer the phone
to Angela the same way,

35:21.553 --> 35:23.355
which is, "Is it--am I dead?

35:23.455 --> 35:26.024
Is it now?"
I don't even say hello.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.859
- All right,
that's a series wrap

35:27.959 --> 35:29.428
on Michael, guys.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.431
[all cheering]

35:32.531 --> 35:34.633
- You know, on our show,
we have wrap-outs

35:34.733 --> 35:38.036
as people have
their final series wraps.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.606
And the final episode
of somebody

35:40.706 --> 35:42.140
who's been on the show
for a while is always

35:42.241 --> 35:43.742
really emotional, you know.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.110
And usually, in any given year,

35:45.211 --> 35:47.279
you might have, like,
a handful of those.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.947
- Maggie nods her head.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.949
And Duncan closes his eyes.

35:51.049 --> 35:55.120
And she gently slides her blade
up into the back of his skull.

35:55.221 --> 35:57.656
End of act three.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.226
- We have our traditions.

36:00.326 --> 36:04.330
We always try to celebrate
when one of us, you know,

36:04.430 --> 36:06.998
goes off into the world again.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.167
- We love you.
- [chuckles]

36:09.268 --> 36:10.769
- We all had a sense
that, you know,

36:10.869 --> 36:12.471
time was very precious.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.406
- I'm Michael Cudlitz.
- I'm Michael Cudlitz.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.476
all: I'm Michael Cudlitz.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.645
- And we should invest
as much in each other

36:19.745 --> 36:22.448
because you never knew when
you were gonna lose somebody.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.483
- This is great.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.152
- As time goes on,
you get used to people dying.

36:27.253 --> 36:30.088
But we just find ways
to make it

36:30.188 --> 36:32.724
ridiculously celebratory
and fun.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.094
- Thank you.
- European.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.163
- Yeah, he's European.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.465
- It's special.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.766
Take as many
of these traditions with us

36:40.866 --> 36:42.000
as we can, I think.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.770
[soft music]

36:44.870 --> 36:46.938
- It's a beautiful way,
actually, to say goodbye

36:47.038 --> 36:50.041
to somebody who's been a part
of the show for a long time.

36:50.141 --> 36:54.713
*

36:54.813 --> 36:56.448
- You know,
everybody comes here to die.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.216
When I meet somebody,
that's what I say to them.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.718
Everybody comes here to die.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.453
And some people
would be, like, horrified.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.355
But that's what
our show is about.

37:03.455 --> 37:10.228
*

37:10.329 --> 37:12.531
- The big departures,
it's always like,

37:12.631 --> 37:15.534
everybody's, like, a little,
like, choked up,

37:15.634 --> 37:17.269
and it's touching.

37:19.170 --> 37:23.709
But this time,
we had to wrap the entire cast,

37:23.809 --> 37:27.613
because for everybody,
this was their last episode.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.916
- How are the cast and you
preparing for the end?

37:31.016 --> 37:33.051
- [laughs]

37:33.151 --> 37:35.020
Um...

37:35.120 --> 37:37.556
taking a lot of photos,
I think.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.891
It's going to be

37:39.991 --> 37:43.028
a mammoth sea of emotion
when it happens.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.830
It's just crazy. Yeah.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.898
But we've done
something great here,

37:46.998 --> 37:50.035
and we've got something
to be so proud of.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.171
And...

37:53.271 --> 37:55.674
dang, this has been--

37:55.774 --> 37:57.409
it's one in a million.

37:57.509 --> 38:04.650
*

38:06.385 --> 38:11.457
- I went to the IMDb
and just scrolled

38:11.557 --> 38:12.791
on and on and on and on,

38:12.891 --> 38:16.862
and there is
almost 100 pages here

38:16.962 --> 38:20.566
of cast and crew
over these seasons

38:20.666 --> 38:22.934
that have come
through these doors

38:23.034 --> 38:25.771
to help make this show
come to life.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.774
It's amazing to me to think

38:28.874 --> 38:31.076
that this is
what I'm a part of.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.578
[clears throat]

38:32.678 --> 38:35.381
And...

38:35.481 --> 38:39.751
we're a part of something
pretty darn incredible.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.654
And I'm grateful.

38:42.754 --> 38:49.728
*

38:49.828 --> 38:51.763
- I know the product

38:51.863 --> 38:54.232
that we put on screen
is one thing,

38:54.332 --> 38:57.302
and that's what connects
so much of the world

38:57.403 --> 39:00.171
to "The Walking Dead,"
but for us,

39:00.271 --> 39:03.174
it's these relationships
that we share.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.743
- Pan over there. Over there.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.746
[engine revving]
[laughs]

39:07.846 --> 39:10.749
- It's been a huge,
massive part

39:10.849 --> 39:13.452
of our everyday life.

39:13.552 --> 39:16.588
And that will never
happen again, ever.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.925
That's what I'll miss.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.594
- I'm in denial.
I'll be really honest.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.463
You know, I'll look at Norman,
and he'll be like,

39:24.563 --> 39:26.364
"It's gonna get sad."

39:28.133 --> 39:30.969
- It's very, um...

39:31.069 --> 39:33.972
surreal to think
that it's all ending now.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.675
- I've definitely had moments
where I'm like, "Oh, wow,

39:36.775 --> 39:40.779
this is the last time
this and that is gonna happen."

39:40.879 --> 39:42.548
- I'm nervous
about saying goodbye.

39:42.648 --> 39:43.882
I'm not gonna lie.

39:43.982 --> 39:47.185
*

39:47.285 --> 39:50.155
- I think I'm just gonna make
an Irish exit.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.724
- I haven't said goodbye yet,
and I don't plan to.

39:52.824 --> 39:55.193
- I'll just dip out.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.795
It'll be too hard.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.630
- So I'm just gonna
kind of walk away,

39:58.730 --> 40:00.666
and then I know
I'll see everybody again,

40:00.766 --> 40:03.469
and we'll just
leave it at that.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.737
- Personally, I'm trying
to get as many moments

40:05.837 --> 40:08.874
individually with people
as I can.

40:08.974 --> 40:12.377
I'm trying to not be fearful
about sharing

40:12.478 --> 40:14.913
just how much I love them.

40:15.013 --> 40:18.884
- I hope it's not goodbye.
[laughs]

40:18.984 --> 40:21.520
These are my best friends.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.858
- That's a series wrap
on Mr. JDM.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.259
[cheers and applause]

40:28.359 --> 40:29.828
That is a wrap on Khary.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.429
[cheers and applause]

40:31.530 --> 40:33.331
Series wrap on Josh.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.000
[cheers and applause]

40:35.100 --> 40:37.769
Series wrap on Christian.
[cheers and applause]

40:37.869 --> 40:40.572
Mr. Norman Reedus, Daryl.
[cheers and applause]

40:40.672 --> 40:42.340
Series wrap on Melissa.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.942
[cheers and applause]

40:44.042 --> 40:45.410
- Love you guys a lot.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.613
- It was truly an honor
being here with you.

40:47.713 --> 40:50.048
- Thank you.
It's really been

40:50.148 --> 40:52.217
one of the best experiences
of my life.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.619
- The one thing we have is that

40:53.719 --> 40:55.186
we were all in the trenches
together.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.523
No one can ever take that
away from us.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.625
- And I won't forget you.
I appreciate you.

40:59.725 --> 41:03.228
- We could lose our friends,
people we love.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.697
It's not about us anymore.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.232
It's about a future.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.105
- Do I want the fans
to be happy with the show?

41:14.205 --> 41:15.406
Yeah, of course.

41:15.507 --> 41:16.808
The fans and the cast
and the crew

41:16.908 --> 41:18.309
and everybody else

41:18.409 --> 41:20.445
has a real relationship
with the outside world

41:20.546 --> 41:22.548
through the show.

41:22.648 --> 41:25.450
You know,
the number of families

41:25.551 --> 41:26.752
that have come to me,

41:26.852 --> 41:28.887
thanked me
for playing the character,

41:28.987 --> 41:31.790
how I play the character,
and...

41:31.890 --> 41:34.125
Daryl's tough, so it's
helped me get through stuff.

41:34.225 --> 41:37.729
You know, things like that
have meant the world to me.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.765
- It just means so much to us

41:39.865 --> 41:42.901
that people are able to have
that escape.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.636
- There are fans
who tell our actors,

41:44.736 --> 41:47.338
like, this show gave me

41:47.438 --> 41:49.741
something to talk
to my dad about

41:49.841 --> 41:52.778
or it allowed me
to come out to my family.

41:52.878 --> 41:56.314
- I know for me,
I am eternally grateful

41:56.414 --> 41:58.483
to have been a part of it.

41:58.584 --> 42:02.721
That being said, there are
new things on the horizon.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.192
- We loved being on the show.

42:07.292 --> 42:09.027
We loved making the show.

42:09.127 --> 42:11.997
It's been us
against the world down here.

42:12.097 --> 42:15.834
But outside of here,
it's just one big happy family.

42:15.934 --> 42:23.041

42:28.213 --> 42:36.254

42:50.969 --> 42:55.073
