What if we don't find Bill Ward
before he releases the virus?

00:05.360 --> 00:07.040
ADINA: We have to find him...

00:07.480 --> 00:08.720
...or we have no future.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.280
BILL: Listen, youâ€™ve got
to get her to my old lab

00:11.360 --> 00:13.000
so that I can extract the virus.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.400
You killed Ash?

00:16.240 --> 00:17.600
If you love me,

00:18.400 --> 00:19.600
then you'll let me go.

They travelled through time.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.840
Here. Professor Bill Ward, London.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.440
We should go find your professor.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.720
So are we extracting this thing
from my blood, or what?

01:18.080 --> 01:19.080
Did you know?

01:21.280 --> 01:22.720
Sacha killed Ash.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.640
He's my son.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.120
Maybe I've always known
what he was like.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.360
(SIGHS)

01:37.000 --> 01:38.240
Didn't want to believe it.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.760
He said it was an accident.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.920
(CHLOE CHUCKLES)

01:46.880 --> 01:50.400
When Sacha was eight,
a friend gave me a kitten.

01:52.920 --> 01:53.960
It was so cute.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.440
Sacha never liked it.
I think he was jealous.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.360
And, one day I couldn't find the kitten.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.160
I went to the bathroom,
I opened the lid of the toilet,

02:08.240 --> 02:10.280
and the kitten was in there...

02:11.440 --> 02:12.640
Under the water.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.360
It had drowned.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.040
I kept telling myself
this was an accident,

02:19.120 --> 02:20.840
but it wasn't. I knew.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.600
I could see it in Sacha's eyes.
He killed it.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.480
I love my son.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.920
But sometimes he scares me.

Won't you talk to me?

04:20.280 --> 04:21.880
I know that you blame me for everything.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.920
Maybe I should have
made different choices.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.600
Maybe I should've told you the truth
about your father.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.600
I didn't want to think about it.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.120
I couldn't.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.520
I just want you to know that everything
I did, I did because I love you.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.160
I'll always love you, no matter what.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.560
Mum?

05:14.880 --> 05:16.120
How did you know I was here?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.520
I knew you would want
to be close to Emily.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.280
Does she talk about me?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.600
Sacha, you have to
stop lying to yourself.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.520
She knows you killed Ash.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.760
We're going to be together.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.520
We're going to have a baby.

Move.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.720
Let him go.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.240
He deserves to die for what he did.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.640
He is my son.

(EXHALES)

06:00.800 --> 06:02.760
BILL: We know that the virus works.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.560
It's shut down your body's
production of insulin.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.960
But we need to combine it with a vector.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.640
Why?

06:13.400 --> 06:16.640
So that you can infect the aliens.
They trust you.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.200
You can get close to them
and then we let the virus do its thing.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.320
You mean, kill them all?

06:24.400 --> 06:25.400
Yes.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.680
We know that we're asking a lot of you.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.240
Think about your family.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.000
What about them?

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
Their families?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.520
You have to decide
what's most important to you.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.120
Okay.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.600
What will it do?

07:03.160 --> 07:06.960
BILL: Well, the vector itself
is harmless...

07:07.040 --> 07:11.320
It's just a means of getting the virus
into the alien's genome.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.800
Bill?

07:32.600 --> 07:33.680
All done.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.760
When do I go and infect them?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.960
We have to wait and see
if the vector works.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.720
We should know...

07:45.040 --> 07:46.600
We should know fairly soon.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.480
Emily.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.160
I wish that what happened
between us was different.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240

08:05.360 --> 08:07.720
That was easier
than I thought it would be.

You were always better

12:08.960 --> 12:11.360
There doesn't always have to be a point.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.920
Maybe you would have been the screw up
and I would've been the clever one.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Don't say that. You're not a screw up.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.520

12:21.880 --> 12:24.000
I don't always change the subject.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.760
When they died I didn't know what to do.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.000
I thought I had to be strong for you.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.840
I kept telling myself, "Don't cry.
Don't cry. Don't cry."

12:51.880 --> 12:54.400
I pushed my feelings so far down...

12:57.920 --> 13:00.600
...until I stopped feeling
anything at all.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.600
See. It's me who's really screwed up.

You're thinking

14:11.160 --> 14:12.280
You feel love for him.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.640
I want to raise him as my own.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.960
When he's older, what if he learns that
we killed his parents?

14:24.680 --> 14:25.960
Killed all of his people?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.440
He'll hate me for it.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.000
He's one of us now.

Because he carries our mark.

we're different to them.

I see the difference any more.

We'll take some blood, run a few tests.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.960
The virus has become
much more aggressive.

So it should spread through the aliens
before they can do anything about it.
