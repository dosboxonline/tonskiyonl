WEBVTT

02:44.831 --> 02:46.249
FROST: It's rusted shut.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.585
Safe bet that they all are.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.256
Where's Maggie?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.468
She w... She was right behind me.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.067
ALDEN: Somebody boost me up.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.194
You go up there, you're dead.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.778
She'd be pissed if you tried.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.823
She'd want us to keep moving forward.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.207
All right, we need to get that door open.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.751
Then we'll go from car to car
until we hit the front of the train.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.252
Then we'll hop off.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.505
And then we just keep going.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.303
NEGAN: Look out, guys.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.631
You know what this means, don't you?
The photo board?

05:41.924 --> 05:43.593
-The Commonwealth is real.
-That was a wallet-sized photo of you,

05:43.676 --> 05:45.678
which means it was
in your brother's wallet,

05:45.762 --> 05:47.889
which means he kept the wallet
on him in the apocalypse,

05:47.972 --> 05:49.599
possibly for 10-plus years,
and who does that?

05:49.682 --> 05:50.767
He sounds awesome.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.894
What?

05:52.977 --> 05:54.771
And also what you said.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.439
So what's the plan?

05:56.522 --> 05:58.649
They have structure. Laws.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.069
Someone here's in charge,
and I'm going to speak to that person.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.196
That's it? The plan is talking?

06:03.279 --> 06:06.157
Yes. Cold as ice. Demand results.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.326
What?

06:08.409 --> 06:11.162
Nothing. It's just...

06:11.245 --> 06:13.414
It's your bro.
You sure you can be "cold as ice"?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.917
Yeah, I was a lawyer. It comes naturally.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.963
Look, I love my brother.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.840
But I hadn't seen him
in a really long time

06:22.924 --> 06:25.051
before all of this, and I assumed...

06:25.134 --> 06:26.761
It doesn't matter. I'll be fine

06:26.844 --> 06:28.429
-as long as I can speak to the...
-Shh! Hang on.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.904
That was her, from last night.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.531
Did you see how she was looking at us?
She knows.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.408
We're fine.
No one knows we tried to leave,

06:48.491 --> 06:49.742
or believe me, we'd be called int...

06:49.826 --> 06:51.077
Ezekiel's gone.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.621
In anticipation of your next question,

06:53.704 --> 06:54.956
I looked everywhere, asked around.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.499
No one's saying anything.
Someone took him.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.917
Someone knows what we did,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.460
and he's just the first domino to fall.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.295
In anticipation of your follow-up query,

07:01.379 --> 07:03.423
I don't know how I know.
I only know that I'm freaking out!

07:03.506 --> 07:05.925
It's probably 'cause
he told off the big guy.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.010
Oh, God. Why'd he tell off the big guy?

07:08.094 --> 07:10.430
We should talk to them.
We should talk to them.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.849
We can come clean about who we are
and where we're really from.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.684
Eugene, for the last time,

07:14.767 --> 07:16.269
do not talk to their law enforcement.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.439
Or if you find yourself in a situation
where you have to, you stick to the story.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.773
Well, what do we do?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.528
Wait, what? Be cool.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.238
Ice! Ice!

07:27.321 --> 07:28.781
You've got one of our people?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.450
What have you done with him?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.994
-I demand to know where he's been taken!
-Ma'am, calm down.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.662
I don't know where your friend is.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.747
Then there's no reason for us
to continue this conversation.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.125
I'd like to speak to somebody
who can actually give me answers.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.418
Who do you report to?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.421
You wanna speak to my supervisor?

07:43.504 --> 07:46.257
That's right!
We wanna talk to the manager!

09:50.840 --> 09:52.425
Hey, Dog! Come here! Come here!

09:52.508 --> 09:54.218
Hey! Dog!

09:54.302 --> 09:55.970
Come here!

09:56.053 --> 09:57.430
Come here!

09:59.390 --> 10:01.559
-Dog!
-(MAN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)

10:01.642 --> 10:02.685
Dog!

10:20.828 --> 10:22.955
I'm not sure why you're here.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.749
You've already been assessed.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.836
You think you've been assessing me?

10:30.212 --> 10:31.922
No, dear.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.174
I've been assessing you.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.345
You don't know anything about me...

10:37.428 --> 10:39.805
Your community's large and organized.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.266
There's a bureaucracy,
and you're part of it.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.563
You probably had a job like this
before the world fell.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.941
If I had to guess,
I'd say forensic psychologist.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.696
Perhaps you were an academic.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.822
Researcher?

10:58.407 --> 11:01.077
Your role is to assess threat
for your community.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.370
You ask about who we were

11:02.453 --> 11:05.790
because someone above you has decided
that that's a good baseline position

11:05.873 --> 11:07.667
from which to judge who we are.

11:09.126 --> 11:12.463
So you poke around the dusty
corners of our brains,

11:12.546 --> 11:13.881
test our sense of boundaries

11:13.964 --> 11:16.550
with queries about our toileting habits.

11:17.885 --> 11:21.972
You raked one of my people over the coals
due to a $2 bill,

11:22.056 --> 11:24.934
which makes me believe
your currency is the U.S. dollar,

11:25.017 --> 11:29.313
and that you need to strictly control
the amount in circulation.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.775
You use familiar money as
a powerful psychological tactic,

11:32.858 --> 11:36.529
because you know how desperately
people miss the old world.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.908
You want to understand
what we're capable of

11:40.991 --> 11:42.785
and whether we can enhance your community

11:42.868 --> 11:45.037
or if we'd simply be a drain on resources.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.957
But the truth of it is,
you need to justify your existence, too.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.753
Because isn't it almost more valuable now

11:52.837 --> 11:54.422
to have someone who can haul the trash

11:54.505 --> 11:56.132
and keep the streets free from disease

11:56.215 --> 11:58.217
than someone who can write
endless lists of questions,

11:58.300 --> 12:00.886
given that at the end of the day,

12:01.971 --> 12:03.556
you just need to rely on your gut instinct

12:03.639 --> 12:05.266
about whether or not
the person across from you

12:05.349 --> 12:07.268
will or won't murder you in your sleep?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.691
But you're both people
that follow the rules.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.818
I was a lawyer.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.278
I like rules.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.031
They bring order to the chaos.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.494
Which means you need me.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.625
I have reason to believe my brother,
a thoracic surgeon,

12:31.709 --> 12:33.961
is living at the Commonwealth
and is looking for me.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.882
I'd like expedited processing
for my group,

12:37.965 --> 12:41.510
as per your community's asylum
and immigration policies.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.304
Where did you go to school again?

12:43.387 --> 12:45.431
Undergraduate at Oxford,
JD is from Harvard,

12:45.514 --> 12:46.515
which you very well know.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.893
Would you like me to list
my professional credentials again?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.150
MERCER: Coffee?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.992
Can you stop moving?
You're taking my nerves over the edge

13:05.075 --> 13:07.036
to a proverbial 11 on a scale of 10.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.788
I can't help it.
We've been waiting and waiting,

13:08.871 --> 13:10.790
and now I have to pee really, really bad.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.793
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
Be right back.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.420
No! No! No more splitting up!

13:16.504 --> 13:19.465
Eugene. If that fine-ass dude
in the orange suit

13:19.548 --> 13:21.342
just walked in with a coffee,

13:21.425 --> 13:23.677
things must be going good
for Yumiko, right?

13:23.761 --> 13:26.806
Maybe she'll be out by the time I'm back.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.701
Uh, do you have toilet paper?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.456
Well, shit!

13:52.540 --> 13:54.834
I'm excited!

14:50.848 --> 14:53.475
On my count. Three, two, one!

15:11.827 --> 15:13.412
NEGAN: Why don't you guys handle that one?

15:13.495 --> 15:16.165
If you get tired out, we'll take over.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.296
ALDEN: Is that the roof?

15:22.379 --> 15:23.714
Could be walkers.

15:23.797 --> 15:24.840
Shh!

15:27.384 --> 15:29.428
It's below us. It's Morse code.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.721
It's SOS.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.461
I slipped.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.964
He saw, and he left me to die.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.548
NEGAN: Yeah.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.553
Okay. So what?

16:11.637 --> 16:12.680
You're just admitting it?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.640
You tried to kill her!

16:14.723 --> 16:17.059
No, she was in trouble, and I didn't help.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.603
There is a big difference.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.482
Okay, so who's gonna help you now?

16:23.565 --> 16:25.401
Who in here's got your back?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.611
Yeah, you don't need fingers
to count that number.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.991
She was just talking about murdering me,

16:32.074 --> 16:33.867
sooner rather than later,

16:33.951 --> 16:36.537
and yet somehow, I'm the big, old asshole

16:36.620 --> 16:38.914
'cause I didn't risk my nuts for her?

16:40.958 --> 16:45.087
I have been a golden goddamn asset
for every single one of you.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.964
Yeah, burning Hilltop, that helped, huh?

16:47.047 --> 16:48.799
I killed Alpha, right?

16:48.882 --> 16:51.719
So, yeah, I was helpful.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.303
'Cause if I hadn't done that,

16:53.387 --> 16:56.265
every person you know,
their skull would be on a spike.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.979
I did what needed to be done, all right?

17:02.062 --> 17:03.564
I am trying.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.067
Yeah, okay. I'm not buying a word of it.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.277
Same.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.071
Nod and it happens.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.115
We can get through the city without him.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.413
GAGE: (MUFFLED) Help! Help me! Help!

17:22.332 --> 17:25.085
-Later.
-Help!

17:25.169 --> 17:26.628
Help!

17:26.712 --> 17:29.381
Gage? What happened?

17:29.465 --> 17:31.467
We got lost in the tunnels!
Walkers are everywhere,

17:31.550 --> 17:33.093
-they... They might have...
-NEGAN: How'd you get in there?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.804
I... I got a door open on the far end.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.182
-Did you close it?
-Uh...

17:38.265 --> 17:40.309
-Gage?
-I...

17:40.392 --> 17:42.895
Hey, this one seems a bit looser.
Sasquatch, give me a hand.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.313
We open that, they'll all get in.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.397
He's right there!

17:45.481 --> 17:47.232
I know he is.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.901
The hell with you.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.612
Alden?

17:51.695 --> 17:52.988
Come on.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.744
Are you insane? Move!

17:58.827 --> 18:00.370
Move!

18:02.623 --> 18:04.666
Maggie?

18:04.750 --> 18:07.878
Maggie! Open the door!

18:09.713 --> 18:11.673
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry...

18:11.757 --> 18:13.884
(CRYING) I made...
I made a mistake, and I'm sorry,

18:13.967 --> 18:15.427
but I just...

18:15.511 --> 18:16.678
I want another chance. Okay?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.597
I won't do it again. I won't do it again.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.891
I'll do better. Please, I... Please.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.144
Maggie, listen to me.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.147
We have time. We can get that door open.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.858
Maggie! Maggie!

18:29.942 --> 18:33.695
We don't have the ammo to clear them.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.493
Let it go.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.541
I'm sorry.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.042
I can't.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.507
Liar.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.149
Pardon me. I've been waiting
for my friend, Yumiko.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.817
She's in that room right there.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.778
I was wondering if you might
be able to provide

20:37.861 --> 20:40.322
or procure for me an ETA
for when she might be done?

20:40.405 --> 20:41.990
No one's in there.

20:44.117 --> 20:47.996
But I watched my friend walk in there
with the two questioners,

20:48.080 --> 20:49.623
and I haven't seen her or them walk out.

20:49.706 --> 20:50.707
If you could just check...

20:50.791 --> 20:52.918
No one is in there, sir.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.753
My other friend went
to use the ladies' room...

20:54.836 --> 20:55.879
What friend?

20:58.048 --> 20:59.424
I need you to leave.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.469
Now.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.008
What is it?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.929
Bad memories.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.976
Of what?

22:36.772 --> 22:38.648
You guys don't wanna look at him.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.941
Why?

22:41.943 --> 22:44.071
Why won't you look at him?

22:44.154 --> 22:47.240
All that is,
is the shell of a man who died a coward.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.119
That's a hot take, Father.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.749
He was scared,

22:55.832 --> 22:58.043
but he didn't deserve to die like that.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.046
In the worst way imaginable.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.174
There are worse ways.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.553
A lot worse.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.402
Before I found Elijah and his people,

23:25.737 --> 23:27.697
Hershel and I were alone for a long time.

23:30.242 --> 23:34.996
One day, we came across this frail old man

23:35.080 --> 23:38.542
who was kneeling
by a turned-over grocery cart.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.629
It was full of scavenged clothes

23:42.712 --> 23:44.131
he said were for his sons and daughters,

23:44.214 --> 23:47.884
and could we help him
haul the cart back home?

23:50.679 --> 23:53.515
And he said he'd give us food
for our trouble.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.936
I knew that he was a liar.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.274
But I was starving,

24:04.359 --> 24:05.861
and soon, Hershel would be.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.864
So we followed him back to his house.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.451
I held a knife to his throat
and reached in his pocket.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.871
I pulled out the chloroform rag
he was gonna use on me.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.791
I stuffed it in his mouth.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.004
And then we went inside the house,

24:24.087 --> 24:26.506
and I locked my little boy in a room,

24:28.258 --> 24:30.177
and I went and searched the house.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.850
There were these three

24:40.645 --> 24:42.230
deformed...

24:45.442 --> 24:46.985
I wouldn't call them men.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.450
They came after me.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.871
But I handled them.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.333
And then the house was quiet,

25:03.168 --> 25:05.212
except for this thudding sound

25:05.295 --> 25:07.756
that was coming from upstairs
in the attic.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.638
And I thought maybe they had
people tied up up there

25:14.721 --> 25:16.932
that were trying to get free.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.773
So I walked to a door
at the end of this hallway.

25:26.733 --> 25:27.984
And I opened it, and I looked up,

25:28.068 --> 25:29.736
and there was a set of stairs.

25:31.571 --> 25:35.200
At the top of the stairs,
there's this shadow

25:36.576 --> 25:38.828
writhing and rocking.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.166
I thought it was an animal.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.421
Then all of a sudden,
it fell down the stairs,

25:50.382 --> 25:52.175
and it came right at my feet.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.595
It was a walker

25:56.596 --> 25:59.266
that used to be a woman.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.103
Her arms and her legs

26:04.813 --> 26:08.108
had been cut off, stitched up.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.821
Her eyes gouged out.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.116
No tongue.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.536
And she was wheezing

26:20.870 --> 26:24.249
through an open, cauterized gash
in her throat

26:24.332 --> 26:27.877
where her vocal cords had been ripped out.

26:31.381 --> 26:34.217
And her belly was round and full.

26:35.885 --> 26:39.306
And whatever was inside of there
was trying to get out.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.977
And I went upstairs,
and there were three more just like her.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.440
But their hearts were still beating.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.987
And do you know the first thing I thought?

26:55.822 --> 26:58.742
The very first thing that crossed my mind?

27:00.952 --> 27:03.204
"If they're alive,

27:03.288 --> 27:05.165
"there must be food here."

27:08.418 --> 27:10.045
So I took care of them.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.465
And then I found the food.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.091
Lots of it.

27:16.426 --> 27:20.930
And Hershel and I filled
the cart with it, and we left.

27:30.273 --> 27:34.069
I don't feel anything
when I tell you that.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.323
Do you understand me?

27:39.991 --> 27:43.078
Because that is what's out there.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.874
And seeing it, I lost something.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.045
And I don't think
it's a bad thing that I did.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.257
Because it has made things
so much clearer.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.806
What we have in Alexandria,

28:02.889 --> 28:06.226
what we had in Hilltop

28:06.309 --> 28:08.228
and in Meridian,

28:10.146 --> 28:12.315
it's rare.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.858
It has to be.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.572
Compared to everything that's out there.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.992
Because if it isn't...

28:24.160 --> 28:26.037
It means we were lucky.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.834
It means that nobody has it figured out.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.171
Nobody ever did,

28:35.255 --> 28:37.799
and nobody ever will.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.430
Dog?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.404
Daryl, help me.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.903
How bad is it?

31:03.987 --> 31:05.738
It ain't good.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.117
You went topside?

31:09.200 --> 31:11.077
Yeah. (COUGHS)

31:11.160 --> 31:12.662
Bad idea.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.123
I lost Gage.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.587
Where's the ammo bag?
Where's the ammo bag?

31:21.754 --> 31:23.631
I lost that, too.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.472
Don't... Stop. Don't waste that on me.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.558
Here. It's all I got.

31:40.481 --> 31:42.692
Tell my kids I didn't die a coward.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.639
FROST: It's blocked.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.367
Hey!

34:38.451 --> 34:39.952
They're coming in from this side!

34:53.966 --> 34:55.343
Back up!

35:34.549 --> 35:36.634
DARYL: Shh, boy.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.737
NEGAN: Come on, little more!

36:39.280 --> 36:40.656
Hurry!

36:42.575 --> 36:44.368
Come on, go!

36:49.540 --> 36:51.709
Get behind something!

38:22.508 --> 38:25.303
What have you done
with my traveling companions?

38:25.386 --> 38:27.513
They're being processed.

38:29.473 --> 38:34.270
"Processed" as in administratively?

38:34.353 --> 38:37.356
Processed as in bologna
or other meat stuffs?

38:37.440 --> 38:39.400
This inquiring mind needs to know.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.154
I want to see them.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.407
You like feeling nervous?

38:47.658 --> 38:48.826
No.

38:48.909 --> 38:52.121
Only one thing gets my heart up.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.290
When I'm out there,

38:54.373 --> 38:55.916
battling the dead.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.128
The magenta swarms.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.466
It's just

39:03.549 --> 39:07.011
pumping, every time.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.765
But not in a bad way.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.147
Here. Mop up.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.366
I... I think that...

39:28.449 --> 39:30.117
You can't lie for shit.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.995
-I...
-So don't lie.

39:33.954 --> 39:38.167
Okay. I wasn't going to.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.711
-You weren't?
-No.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.338
That makes me like you.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.759
Keep doing that, it'll help you.

39:46.842 --> 39:48.761
If you don't...

39:52.598 --> 39:53.682
You get me?

39:56.727 --> 39:58.562
Use your words.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.399
Yes. Yes, sir.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.942
Good.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.068
Now.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.363
I know you're holding back.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.533
You know you're holding back.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.743
I'm going to give you two questions.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.788
You're going to give me two answers.
Truthful ones.

40:17.498 --> 40:18.916
You do that?

40:18.999 --> 40:20.126
You get to go.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.087
You get to see your friends again.

40:24.755 --> 40:26.465
Everything will be okay.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.219
It's that simple.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.974
-Ready?
-(WHIMPERS QUIETLY)

40:35.057 --> 40:36.851
Where is your settlement?

40:36.934 --> 40:38.894
And why were you at that train station?

40:41.313 --> 40:42.815
Mm, Eugene.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.651
If you lie.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.863
I'll know.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.533
Okey-dokey.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.581
(INHALES DEEPLY) You're right.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.126
I have been holding something back.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.589
Frankly, I wanted to speak up before this,

41:06.672 --> 41:08.757
but I was afraid of what
my friends would think.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.888
I haven't always been
the most emotional fella,

41:13.971 --> 41:18.642
but my 10,000-plus hours
of death, loss, and fear

41:18.726 --> 41:21.437
have opened me up a little bit.

41:21.520 --> 41:26.609
In the course of our travels,
I found this radio.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.863
Night after night,
I would speak into the void,

41:30.946 --> 41:34.533
holding onto a... A "what if,"

41:34.617 --> 41:37.703
as fools are wont to do,
and I am nothing if not a fool.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.920
Then one night,

41:46.003 --> 41:48.297
a voice came back from said void.

41:49.548 --> 41:51.133
A beautiful voice.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.556
We got to talking, and she...

42:00.100 --> 42:03.270
...was not repulsed by my musings.

42:05.189 --> 42:09.527
We spoke of train museums
and ice cream cones.

42:09.610 --> 42:10.819
We laughed.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.074
We sang Iron Maiden.

42:17.993 --> 42:20.204
And then we wanted to meet.

42:20.287 --> 42:22.540
So I got my friends

42:23.707 --> 42:26.043
to go to that train yard under the guise

42:26.126 --> 42:28.087
of asking whoever showed up
for help for us three,

42:28.170 --> 42:30.631
because I knew they wouldn't go otherwise.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.803
But all I was thinking about
was Stephanie.

42:37.179 --> 42:40.975
So yes, I lied.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.227
I've been lying this whole time,
because I'm afraid to lose

42:43.310 --> 42:46.355
the three friends I have in this world.

42:46.438 --> 42:48.899
And I lied to Stephanie about
being from a large settlement

42:48.983 --> 42:51.277
because I was afraid that maybe,

42:51.360 --> 42:53.571
she was not who she said she was.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.656
That maybe she was a femme fatale,

42:56.949 --> 42:59.034
laying a trap for a lonely heart.

43:01.620 --> 43:04.373
My track record in the romantic realm
is spotty at best.

43:04.456 --> 43:07.751
I'm not one for whom
any relationships come easy,

43:07.835 --> 43:10.170
particularly those with the fairer sex.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.217
And I am, in fact, a virgin.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.888
Even though I have, uh, observed the act

43:19.972 --> 43:22.016
far more times than I care to admit.

43:25.519 --> 43:28.147
Thank you for holding back your titters.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.651
I was... I was hoping

43:32.735 --> 43:35.154
that after a suitable period of courtship,

43:35.237 --> 43:38.866
that Stephanie might be the one
to change my unenviable status,

43:38.949 --> 43:41.076
because deep down,
I was hoping that maybe, in fact,

43:41.160 --> 43:43.287
she was my One True Love.

43:43.370 --> 43:45.873
And now I've been forced to
admit that in this room,

43:45.956 --> 43:47.875
and I'm humiliated by it.

43:49.168 --> 43:52.796
(CRYING) And...

43:52.880 --> 43:56.300
I'm afraid that if Stephanie finds out
that I wasn't honest with her, either,

43:56.383 --> 43:59.678
that she might want to have
nothing to do with me anymore.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.724
So here I am,

44:06.935 --> 44:09.146
very relieved to get that off my chest.

44:10.939 --> 44:12.775
Because everything else
I've said up to this point

44:12.858 --> 44:15.027
has been the goddamn truth.

45:03.992 --> 45:05.953
Eugene!

45:18.841 --> 45:20.926
EZEKIEL: It's okay, man. Let it out.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.474
I thought... Where'd they take you?

45:27.558 --> 45:29.184
An infirmary.

45:29.268 --> 45:32.980
A medic steamed my face,
gave me this nasty herbal cough syrup,

45:33.063 --> 45:35.566
and I slept.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.860
They spiked the cough syrup?

45:37.943 --> 45:39.945
No, no. They took the lantern
out of my room,

45:40.028 --> 45:41.321
and I fell asleep.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.990
Medic checked on me a couple of times,

45:43.073 --> 45:45.451
and then they brought Yumiko to visit,
and then they took us

45:45.534 --> 45:48.078
to a holding room with Princess,
and then they brought us here.

45:48.162 --> 45:50.205
Yeah. Thank God you're here, too.
We were worried.

46:00.924 --> 46:05.721
Pursuant to Section 114A
of the New Articles of Perpetual Union,

46:05.804 --> 46:08.557
in deference to traditions
established by Article 1,

46:08.640 --> 46:10.225
Section 8 of the Legacy Constitution

46:10.309 --> 46:13.145
and Article 14 of the Legacy UDHR,

46:13.228 --> 46:15.731
you have successfully completed
initial processing

46:15.814 --> 46:18.317
in consideration
for asylum and citizenship

46:18.400 --> 46:20.736
in these united townships.

46:22.696 --> 46:26.325
When you walk through these doors,
you'll be escorted to orientation.

46:27.534 --> 46:28.744
By a beat cop.

46:30.037 --> 46:32.581
Welcome to the Commonwealth.

46:39.046 --> 46:42.090
I went to West Point, asshole.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.679
I don't get it. What the hell changed?
Why did they all...

46:47.763 --> 46:49.640
Don't question it. We're in.

46:59.149 --> 47:03.695
Um, which one of you is Eugene?

47:07.491 --> 47:08.659
Hi.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.454
I'm Stephanie.

48:18.478 --> 48:19.980
What is that?

48:20.063 --> 48:23.525
It's a letter from this kid
to his parents.

48:23.609 --> 48:25.444
It's from back before.

48:26.278 --> 48:27.654
You found it?

48:27.738 --> 48:29.656
Yeah, down in the tunnels.

48:29.740 --> 48:33.076
See anything else down there?

48:33.160 --> 48:35.746
Nah. Just the same stuff you saw.

48:40.459 --> 48:41.960
We heading out?

48:42.044 --> 48:44.922
We need to take a detour first.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.048
Arbor Hills.

48:46.131 --> 48:49.217
-What's there?
-Hidden supply depot.

48:49.301 --> 48:51.553
Georgie set 'em up all over,
in case we ran into any trouble

48:51.637 --> 48:54.514
when we were out looking for survivors.

48:54.598 --> 48:58.644
It has ammo, food, weapons.

49:01.396 --> 49:03.732
Rest up there, restock,
and then head to Meridian.

49:03.815 --> 49:06.443
Radio tower marks that neighborhood.

49:09.112 --> 49:10.322
You know where that is?

49:12.032 --> 49:14.409
Yeah. Come on.

49:14.493 --> 49:17.329
DARYL: Come on. Come on, boy.

49:54.282 --> 49:56.326
Well, this place sure has gone to shit

49:56.410 --> 49:58.870
since the last time I was here.

50:06.294 --> 50:08.880
Let's double back. We can cut through...

50:11.550 --> 50:13.260
Aah! Aah!
