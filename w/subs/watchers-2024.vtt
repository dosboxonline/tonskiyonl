18:32.816 --> 18:33.875
Places, everyone.

18:34.010 --> 18:36.552
I don't understand.
Is someone coming here?

18:36.687 --> 18:37.379
[Darwin chirps]

18:37.515 --> 18:39.584
We call them the Watchers.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.456
[Watchers shrieking]

18:44.189 --> 18:45.827
They're coming.

18:46.363 --> 18:48.956
Mina, I know you must be
feeling very afraid,

18:49.092 --> 18:51.900
but I want you to know
that you'll be all right.

18:52.035 --> 18:53.601
You will survive this night.

18:53.736 --> 18:56.331
The Watchers cannot come in.
They just want to look at you.

18:56.466 --> 18:57.900
They're out there?

18:58.036 --> 19:00.706
[Ciara] Yes, they are.
It's a window on the other side.

19:01.642 --> 19:04.345
They come every night
just after sunset.

19:04.481 --> 19:06.880
And they watch us
until the sun rises again.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.911
It's strange at first, but
you'll get used to it in time.

19:14.088 --> 19:15.356
They're here.

19:17.188 --> 19:18.326
Mina.

19:19.590 --> 19:22.297
Mina, take a step forward.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.664
Go ahead. It's all right.

19:35.979 --> 19:37.739
[rustling, rattling]

19:37.875 --> 19:39.545
What is that?
What are they doing?

19:40.412 --> 19:41.679
[Madeline] Applause.

19:42.754 --> 19:44.084
For you, Mina.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.117
[rumbling, rattling continue]

19:45.252 --> 19:47.652
A welcome to the show.

19:50.191 --> 19:55.660
[rumbling continues]

20:10.473 --> 20:11.709
[Darwin chirps]

20:13.479 --> 20:15.977
[deep, mechanical rumble]

20:23.558 --> 20:25.591
- [latch clanks]
- [door creaks open]

20:27.694 --> 20:29.364
[whispers]
We're leaving, Darwin.

20:29.998 --> 20:31.333
[Darwin chirps]

20:36.040 --> 20:37.035
[Ciara] Where're you going?

20:37.170 --> 20:38.340
[Mina] Home.

20:39.340 --> 20:40.502
[Daniel] You won't make it.

20:40.638 --> 20:41.739
[Mina] I can't stay here.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.379
I'm sorry. Good luck.

20:45.642 --> 20:46.612
[Madeline] Let her go.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.581
[sighs]

20:49.987 --> 20:51.479
Those people are crazy.

20:51.615 --> 20:52.950
[chirps] Try not to die.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.488
[Mina] I'll find the car.

20:55.990 --> 20:59.990
We'll get it to work and we'll
be home before you know it.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.858
[sighs]

21:06.597 --> 21:07.897
[woman whispers] Mina.

21:11.072 --> 21:11.901
[Darwin chirps]

21:16.640 --> 21:18.710
[Mina breathes heavily]

21:21.819 --> 21:23.748
[rumbling]

21:24.580 --> 21:26.685
[chittering]

21:27.586 --> 21:29.052
[woman] Why did you do that?

21:29.188 --> 21:30.953
[gasps]

21:44.567 --> 21:48.003
[panting]

22:11.561 --> 22:14.436
[panting]

22:27.015 --> 22:28.345
[gasps]

22:29.048 --> 22:31.146
You're not the first
to have tried getting out.

22:32.282 --> 22:36.458
We've all tried, and failed,
at one time or another.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.625
Come with me.

22:39.862 --> 22:42.424
The forest has been known
to cause hallucinations.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.896
If you're not careful,
it can drive you mad.

22:46.998 --> 22:50.032
While in these woods,
we are prey.

22:51.601 --> 22:56.005
But if you open your eyes, you
can learn to master this place.

22:58.015 --> 22:59.340
They're landmarks,

22:59.476 --> 23:02.947
positioned all across the forest
in a nearly perfect circle.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.817
Each is about a half day's
journey from the Coop.

23:06.883 --> 23:08.424
If you stay within the boundary,

23:08.559 --> 23:10.451
there's hope of returning
by nightfall.

23:11.321 --> 23:14.793
But if you choose
to step over this line...

23:15.528 --> 23:16.630
There's no turning back.

23:18.628 --> 23:19.760
Who built them?

23:20.296 --> 23:22.900
Daniel and Ciara call him
"The Professor."

23:25.735 --> 23:27.003
Come along, Mina.

23:27.904 --> 23:29.570
The sun is passing its peak.

23:29.706 --> 23:33.012
[bird cawing]

23:33.147 --> 23:34.076
Come.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.015
Good evening.

23:41.151 --> 23:44.018
What a show
we have for you tonight.

23:44.154 --> 23:47.760
The stranger, Mina,
joins us again.

23:47.896 --> 23:50.394
We're all just buzzing
to see what she'll do.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.426
Will she eat her dinner?

23:52.562 --> 23:56.166
Or will she refuse her plate
like last night? [chuckles]

23:56.802 --> 23:59.172
Will she snore as she sleeps?

24:00.075 --> 24:03.105
And how many times will she
get up to piss in the bucket?

24:04.274 --> 24:07.149
Yeah. We're all
on the edge of our seats.

24:07.285 --> 24:09.111
[Watchers chittering outside]

24:09.946 --> 24:12.719
Right, then. Let's begin.

24:14.222 --> 24:15.986
[chuckles]

24:16.755 --> 24:18.358
What am I supposed to do?

24:18.794 --> 24:21.761
Just be yourself.
That's all they want.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.668
[Ciara]
They like it when I dance.

24:30.337 --> 24:34.570
["Carnival of the Animals"
by Camille Saint-Saëns plays]

24:34.705 --> 24:35.973
[Daniel chuckles]

24:56.861 --> 25:00.333
[music continues faintly]

25:00.468 --> 25:02.571
[Watchers chittering]

25:03.602 --> 25:05.640
[music continues]

25:11.412 --> 25:12.515
[music stops]

25:13.850 --> 25:15.447
[female tv announcer]
<i>Twelve hot strangers,</i>

25:15.583 --> 25:16.682
<i>trapped in a house.</i>

25:17.184 --> 25:19.952
<i>The world will be watching
their every move.</i>

25:20.088 --> 25:22.786
<i>Who will find love?
Who will make it out?</i>

25:22.921 --> 25:24.753
<i>On this season of</i> Lair of Love.

25:24.888 --> 25:28.025
[contestants cheering]

25:31.366 --> 25:32.601
[woman] <i>Hi!</i>

25:33.937 --> 25:35.297
<i>My name is Georgia.
- </i> [man] <i>Georgia.</i>

25:35.432 --> 25:37.265
- [Georgia] <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
- [man] <i>Welcome.</i>

25:39.540 --> 25:43.810
[people chatter on tv]

25:44.575 --> 25:46.076
[oohing]

25:46.978 --> 25:48.116
<i>Where's the champers, eh?</i>

25:48.719 --> 25:50.812
<i>My name's Georgia.
- Georgia?</i>

25:50.947 --> 25:52.352
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

25:52.487 --> 25:56.053
[contestants cheering]

26:01.425 --> 26:03.863
[Madeline] Ten hours
and two minutes of sunlight.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.602
May we meet again before dark.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.739
[Ciara] You can come with me.

26:13.804 --> 26:15.072
I won't bite.

26:17.380 --> 26:18.412
<i>Prunella vulgaris.</i>

26:18.548 --> 26:20.046
[Darwin squawks] <i>Vulgaris.</i>

26:20.182 --> 26:23.212
[chuckles] I make a paste
from them. For pain relief.

26:25.554 --> 26:27.319
Daniel gets splitting headaches.

26:28.355 --> 26:30.956
He's a sweet boy. He just needs
someone to take care of him.

26:32.428 --> 26:33.795
[chuckles] It's funny.

26:33.930 --> 26:36.430
John always figured
that Danny might fancy me.

26:36.565 --> 26:37.959
Told him he was being silly.

26:38.095 --> 26:39.995
John's my husband, by the way.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.796
We came to the forest together.

26:41.932 --> 26:43.833
He's very handsome.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.707
You'll see when you meet him.

26:46.842 --> 26:49.611
- Where is he?
- He left six days ago.

26:49.746 --> 26:51.878
At first
I thought he sent you here.

26:52.613 --> 26:53.847
He hasn't come back?

26:56.086 --> 26:57.015
Not yet.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.151
<i>Stachys sylvatica.</i>

27:02.286 --> 27:03.989
Good for inflammation
and bleeding.

27:06.159 --> 27:09.126
What do they want from us?
The Watchers.

27:10.466 --> 27:11.359
We're not quite sure.

27:13.370 --> 27:14.737
Madeline has a theory

27:14.872 --> 27:16.837
that just seeing one
could drive a person mad.

27:19.502 --> 27:21.139
Come on.
I want to show you something.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.405
We'll keep this between us, okay?

27:24.441 --> 27:26.781
We're not supposed to go
close to the burrows.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.688
They're all over the forest.

27:33.957 --> 27:36.252
Connected underground
like a system of tunnels.

27:37.654 --> 27:40.157
It's where the Watchers go
during the daylight hours.

27:43.067 --> 27:46.167
Sometimes I like to come
out here and remind myself...

27:46.769 --> 27:48.671
...that as long
as the sun's out,

27:49.671 --> 27:51.234
there's nothing to be afraid of.

27:54.206 --> 27:57.306
Ciara, how long
have you been here?

27:59.745 --> 28:00.607
I don't know.

28:01.444 --> 28:02.876
It's hard to keep track
of the days.

28:03.012 --> 28:04.212
But not long.

28:04.347 --> 28:06.221
John and I were the last
to arrive.

28:06.357 --> 28:07.723
Before you, that is.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.023
So if I had to guess, I'd say...

28:12.627 --> 28:14.026
...nearly five months.

28:16.926 --> 28:18.701
[inhales]

28:21.799 --> 28:23.030
[Madeline] Mina?

28:23.499 --> 28:26.071
You should know,
there are a few rules.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.476
[all three together] Do not
turn your back to the mirror.

28:31.845 --> 28:34.578
Do not open the door after dark.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.418
Do not go near the burrows.

28:37.554 --> 28:39.721
Always stay in the light.

28:39.856 --> 28:41.116
[Madeline]
It's important to remember

28:41.251 --> 28:43.088
that we are in their territory.

28:44.624 --> 28:47.895
The Watchers allow us to live
because we follow their rules.

28:48.959 --> 28:50.898
[pop music plays]

28:51.034 --> 28:53.664

28:59.374 --> 29:01.436

[Romeo] <i>Like, Chloe's just like,
so peng.</i>

29:04.977 --> 29:06.443
<i>Like, when we was locking lips,</i>

29:06.578 --> 29:09.147
<i>it felt like the universe
is just colliding.</i>

29:09.282 --> 29:10.716
<i>It felt right,
you know what I mean?</i>

29:11.419 --> 29:14.285
<i>And I bet she's just, like,
killer in the bedroom.</i>

29:14.420 --> 29:15.990
<i>Like, she's just got
that look about her,</i>

29:16.125 --> 29:18.752
<i>that kind of like,
feral almost, look.</i>

29:18.888 --> 29:22.028
<i>And I think I could
match that toe to toe, so...</i>

29:22.796 --> 29:24.833
[continues, indistinct]

29:25.731 --> 29:27.264

Ever since John left,
I've been hunting on my own.

31:49.273 --> 31:50.946
We all have a role to play.

31:51.814 --> 31:52.912
We work together to survive.

31:53.047 --> 31:54.345
- [bones snap]
- [crow squeals]

31:56.581 --> 31:59.416
Madeline used to teach
at some university.

31:59.552 --> 32:01.517
That's why she thinks
she knows everything.

32:03.753 --> 32:05.853
I know she can be
a bit intense, but...

32:06.756 --> 32:08.689
she's been here a lot longer
than any of us.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.659
[girls laughing, echoes]

32:20.841 --> 32:23.176
[bones rattle]

32:26.412 --> 32:28.346
How long have you been here,
Daniel?

32:29.214 --> 32:31.118
Eight months, three days.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.220
[Mina] Eight months,
and you've never seen one?

32:35.088 --> 32:36.553
You've never seen a Watcher?

32:37.089 --> 32:38.455
[Daniel] Of course not.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.590
No one sees a Watcher
and survives.

32:42.898 --> 32:44.329
Did Madeline tell you that?

32:47.363 --> 32:48.663
You don't believe her?

32:49.373 --> 32:50.302
No.

32:51.941 --> 32:53.536
I don't think you do, either.

32:58.679 --> 32:59.608
Mina.

33:00.949 --> 33:03.711
Mina. This is a bad idea.

33:04.854 --> 33:06.820
This is a really bad idea.

33:06.956 --> 33:09.223
Wait! It's against the rules!

33:10.126 --> 33:11.488
[Mina]
You can go back to the Coop.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.997
Tell Madeline
you lost me in the woods.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.099
Go on living by her rules.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.302
But don't you want to know
what they are?

33:25.409 --> 33:27.339

[ragged breathing]

34:28.635 --> 34:30.534
[Daniel] Don't step
out of the sunlight, Mina.

34:30.669 --> 34:34.340
- [exhales]
- Seriously, stay in the light.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.708
[Mina shrieks]

35:46.817 --> 35:48.282
[metal object rattling]

35:54.484 --> 35:56.523
[creaking, rattling]

35:56.892 --> 35:57.621
[Mina] You got it?

35:58.222 --> 35:59.293
[Daniel] Got it.

36:03.493 --> 36:05.563
[bike rattling above]

36:08.631 --> 36:09.732
[faint guttural chittering]

36:28.187 --> 36:29.521
[trembling exhale]

36:30.825 --> 36:32.260
Daniel.

36:34.094 --> 36:36.060
[Mina panting]

36:36.196 --> 36:38.697
[footsteps approaching]

36:38.833 --> 36:39.927
Daniel!

36:40.770 --> 36:42.699
[rasping growl]

36:45.369 --> 36:46.868
[slow chittering]

36:49.741 --> 36:51.845
[low voice rumbling]
<i>Ainriochtán.</i>

36:51.980 --> 36:52.742
[shrieks] Daniel!

36:53.477 --> 36:54.777
[chittering echoes]

36:56.916 --> 36:59.080
[Madeline] Tell me again
where you found all this?

36:59.216 --> 37:02.455
[Mina] Out by Danny's spot,
stashed under a big rock.

37:04.023 --> 37:06.155
You said there was no chance
we could make it out by sunset.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.288
Not on foot.

37:07.924 --> 37:09.627
This changes everything,
doesn't it?

37:11.635 --> 37:12.395
Perhaps.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.368
[Daniel] Hey guys, come in here.

37:18.473 --> 37:20.242
You saw something today,
didn't you?

37:21.638 --> 37:23.344
Something that scared you.

37:25.781 --> 37:26.677
No.

37:28.015 --> 37:29.009
What was it?

37:30.579 --> 37:31.814
What did you see?

37:33.954 --> 37:34.982
Nothing.

37:36.221 --> 37:37.556
Honestly.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.862
The electronics
break down out there,

37:43.198 --> 37:44.293
somehow they work in here.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.698
The Professor must have created
some sort of power source.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.800
My best guess is
it's underneath us.

37:56.477 --> 37:57.939
[Ciara]
That's fantastic, Daniel.

37:58.849 --> 38:00.040
Surveillance.

38:01.384 --> 38:03.483
I figure if we
put it outside tonight...

38:04.685 --> 38:06.321
<i>We'll be able
to see the Watchers.</i>

38:08.418 --> 38:11.821
["Carnival of the Animals"
by Camille Saint-Saëns plays]

38:27.169 --> 38:29.476
Where are they?
They should be here by now.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.042
They'll come. They always come.

38:34.146 --> 38:37.847
[Madeline] Just act as if
everything is normal, all right?

38:40.285 --> 38:41.855
[light tap]

38:41.990 --> 38:45.019
[music ends]

38:49.032 --> 38:50.497
Did anyone hear that?

38:51.527 --> 38:52.664
Sounded like...

38:55.038 --> 38:56.265
[door handle rattles]

38:56.401 --> 38:57.834
[bang on door]

39:00.036 --> 39:01.574
[Ciara]
There's someone at the door.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.273
No one move a muscle.

39:04.408 --> 39:06.007
[knocking]

39:06.909 --> 39:08.511
[Daniel] Someone's out there.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.484
- Impossible.
- [tapping]

39:10.620 --> 39:12.787
No one can survive the forest
after sunset.

39:12.922 --> 39:13.887
This is a trick.

39:14.022 --> 39:15.918
[knocking]

39:16.987 --> 39:18.752
[Madeline]
Mina, I know you're lying

39:18.887 --> 39:21.095
about where you found that bike.

39:21.230 --> 39:22.958
I need you to be honest with me.

39:23.693 --> 39:25.100
Did you break the rules?

39:25.235 --> 39:27.996
- [man coughing]
- [knocking]

39:28.731 --> 39:30.504
[Ciara] Oh, my God.

39:31.468 --> 39:32.605
[Madeline] Wait.

39:33.338 --> 39:35.635
[light knocking]

39:35.770 --> 39:38.941
John? Is that you?

39:44.851 --> 39:47.449
[John] Yes, honey.
Please open the door.

39:47.585 --> 39:49.787
He's back. John's back.

39:50.487 --> 39:51.422
[John coughing]

39:51.557 --> 39:53.021
You're smarter than this, Ciara.

39:54.223 --> 39:56.257
- [John] Ciara.
- I told you he'd come back.

39:56.392 --> 39:58.391
- [John] They're coming, honey.
- [knocking, thumping]

39:58.527 --> 40:00.930
- You need to let me inside.
- John, I'm opening the doo--

40:02.065 --> 40:04.536
We do not open the door
after sunset.

40:04.671 --> 40:06.200
No matter what.
That is the rule.

40:06.335 --> 40:10.139
The rules don't matter anymore,
my husband is outside.

40:10.275 --> 40:14.278
[John] Darling, I don't mean
to scare you, but I'm hurt.

40:14.414 --> 40:15.714
Pretty bad. Please.

40:15.849 --> 40:18.352
The Watchers are
playing with us, baiting us.

40:18.488 --> 40:19.751
- No, I--
- [Madeline] This is a trick.

40:19.886 --> 40:21.616
No, I know my husband's voice.
It's him.

40:21.751 --> 40:23.151
Even if it's not John,

40:23.286 --> 40:24.622
if there's someone out there
we should help them.

40:24.758 --> 40:25.955
We do not open the door
for anyone.

40:26.722 --> 40:27.993
[urgent knocking]

40:28.128 --> 40:29.393
Mina?

40:29.929 --> 40:31.632
[Ciara] John,
just wait one second, honey.

40:31.767 --> 40:34.062
[Madeline] Tell me what you did.
Tell me where you went.

40:34.897 --> 40:37.067
I went down into a burrow.

40:37.203 --> 40:38.406
My God.

40:38.541 --> 40:40.308
[Daniel]
She wasn't alone. I helped her.

40:40.443 --> 40:42.037
[Madeline]
Daniel acts on impulse.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.671
You knew he would follow you.
You used him.

40:44.806 --> 40:45.839
You don't know me.

40:45.974 --> 40:47.942
[Madeline] I see you, Mina.

40:48.078 --> 40:50.545
You are angry,
and you are selfish.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.181
You behave like a child.

40:52.317 --> 40:55.021
I'm not supposed to be here,
and I'm not staying here.

40:55.156 --> 40:56.184
Do you get that?

40:56.920 --> 40:58.051
I'm the one that's getting out.

40:58.187 --> 40:59.890
[Ciara]
Shut up. Everyone just shut up.

41:00.026 --> 41:03.095
My husband is outside,
and I'm opening the door.

41:03.230 --> 41:04.730
Stop, wait.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.160
Wait just one second.

41:07.296 --> 41:09.663
Ask him something
only he would know.

41:09.799 --> 41:12.003
[John] Darling, please.

41:12.139 --> 41:13.300
Why?

41:13.435 --> 41:14.905
Now's not the time
to stop trusting me. Do it.

41:15.572 --> 41:17.776
[tapping]

41:19.147 --> 41:20.548
[sniffing]

41:21.918 --> 41:22.950
John?

41:23.085 --> 41:24.480
[panting]

41:24.616 --> 41:26.147
I'm so sorry, honey.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.052
[inhales]
What book am I reading?

41:34.062 --> 41:35.024
John?

41:37.429 --> 41:38.698
[John] Book?

41:41.236 --> 41:42.504
<i>I don't know.</i>

41:43.705 --> 41:47.873
Yes, you do. You do, baby.
[sobs]

41:48.009 --> 41:51.612
We bought it at that
beautiful bookshop in Dublin.

41:53.249 --> 41:54.415
You knew I'd love it.

41:54.551 --> 41:56.617
You told me
it reminded you of me.

41:57.286 --> 41:58.717
[John] Hold me, please.

41:58.853 --> 42:01.523
Just let me inside
so I can touch you.

42:02.756 --> 42:04.119
There's something wrong
with him.

42:04.254 --> 42:07.787
Ciara, the Watchers
do not spare human life.

42:07.923 --> 42:09.156
You don't know that.

42:09.292 --> 42:10.429
[Daniel] They're out there
with him, Ciara.

42:10.564 --> 42:11.663
The Watchers are out there.

42:11.798 --> 42:13.462
They come here
every night, Ciara.

42:13.597 --> 42:14.765
Every night.

42:14.901 --> 42:16.532
Why would tonight
be an exception?

42:16.668 --> 42:17.968
[John] I can hear them.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.740
They're coming.

42:23.745 --> 42:25.673
John, there's a camera
by your feet.

42:25.808 --> 42:26.807
[Madeline] Ciara.

42:26.943 --> 42:28.142
I need you to pick it up,

42:28.277 --> 42:30.279
I need you
to bring it to your face,

42:30.415 --> 42:32.886
so the others can see that
it's you and that you're alone.

42:33.990 --> 42:35.617
And then I can open the door,
and you can come inside.

42:35.752 --> 42:36.954
[Madeline] Ciara!

42:47.763 --> 42:50.466
[panting]

42:50.602 --> 42:51.771
<i>Help me--</i>

42:52.272 --> 42:53.199
John?

42:53.335 --> 42:55.071
- John, come back!
- [Madeline] Ciara.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.672
Let my husband go!
[sobbing]

42:58.807 --> 42:59.977
Johnny...

43:00.612 --> 43:02.243
I'm so sorry.

43:05.153 --> 43:06.918
[growl]

43:07.551 --> 43:08.654
[gasps]

43:08.789 --> 43:09.552
[Madeline]
They're coming. Places.

- [cable snaps]

43:16.794 --> 43:18.226

43:21.430 --> 43:23.732
- [heavy banging]
- What are they doing?

43:23.868 --> 43:25.205
They're trying to get in.

43:25.674 --> 43:27.070
- [banging]
- [angry chittering]

43:27.205 --> 43:28.872
If the glass breaks,
this is over for us.

43:29.008 --> 43:30.304
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

43:30.439 --> 43:32.541
- [Watchers squealing]
- [thudding intensifies]

43:32.677 --> 43:33.978
Get behind me.

[shrieking, growling]

43:39.849 --> 43:42.723
[growls fade]

44:01.004 --> 44:02.237
We'll find another way out.

44:05.943 --> 44:07.946
Are you done breaking the rules?

44:32.773 --> 44:35.336

Yes, Mother.

My hair will get all messy.

you can't just follow the rules.

48:35.618 --> 48:37.182
But I can feel it now.

48:37.950 --> 48:40.053
I know that he's gone.

48:41.925 --> 48:43.016
[Mina]
You're not thinking straight.

48:43.151 --> 48:44.319
None of us are.

48:44.455 --> 48:45.885
I should be with him,
shouldn't I?

48:46.755 --> 48:49.359
- If they dragged him down there.
- Don't be silly.

48:51.427 --> 48:53.264
I don't think I'm being silly.

48:54.162 --> 48:55.937
[Daniel screams]

48:57.538 --> 48:58.533
Daniel.

48:59.635 --> 49:01.104
[Mina]
He was hunting with Madeline.

49:01.239 --> 49:02.935
I shouldn't have
left them alone.

49:03.071 --> 49:04.242
Daniel!

49:05.142 --> 49:06.508
What are you doing?

49:07.343 --> 49:09.282
The boy has lost his mind.

49:09.717 --> 49:10.611
Untie me, Daniel.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.955
Our rules now.

49:15.018 --> 49:16.524
Wait, Danny.

49:16.659 --> 49:18.685
Just talk to me. Wait!

49:20.628 --> 49:24.394
I told you once that this forest
brings out the worst in us all.

49:25.431 --> 49:28.200
We need to get back
to the Coop, now.

49:33.368 --> 49:36.437
[Mina] Danny. Daniel!

49:36.573 --> 49:38.975
[Ciara]
Daniel, don't do this. Please.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.179
[whispers] Oh, my God.

49:40.947 --> 49:42.145
Open the door, Daniel.

49:42.280 --> 49:43.551
- [Ciara] Danny.
- [Daniel] No.

49:43.686 --> 49:45.010
Open the door, Daniel!

49:45.146 --> 49:47.487
[Daniel] We do not open the door
for anyone, no matter what.

49:47.623 --> 49:49.817
[birds squawk]

49:50.387 --> 49:51.818
The sun is going down, Daniel.

49:51.954 --> 49:53.460
[Daniel] You should have
left her out there, Mina.

49:53.595 --> 49:54.253
Let's go.

49:54.389 --> 49:55.989
[Watchers growling]

49:56.125 --> 49:57.864
[Mina] We should talk to him.
He's just trying to scare us.

49:57.999 --> 49:59.396
Do not underestimate his anger.

49:59.965 --> 50:00.996
- Danny.
- Hmm?

50:01.132 --> 50:02.399
Why did you do that?

50:03.334 --> 50:05.105
[Daniel]
Something had to change.

50:06.439 --> 50:09.036
Come on, Ciara.
The Watchers will be here soon.

50:09.171 --> 50:11.012
[panting]

50:13.142 --> 50:15.049
[panting]

50:17.212 --> 50:20.087
[panting] Look.

50:21.789 --> 50:22.749
It's rotting.

50:24.360 --> 50:26.390
[Madeline] Let's hope
it's enough to mask our scent.

50:29.363 --> 50:32.864
The rule is,
"Everyone inside by sunset.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.399
All of us, in the light."

50:39.872 --> 50:41.171
Where are they?

50:41.306 --> 50:43.176
They'll come, they always come.

51:00.695 --> 51:02.591
[fluttering]

51:05.128 --> 51:08.333
[chittering]

51:12.003 --> 51:15.769
[growling]

51:20.374 --> 51:22.083
[chittering]

51:25.247 --> 51:27.847
[snarling]

51:28.920 --> 51:30.454
[growls]

51:32.254 --> 51:33.721
[shrieks]

51:51.680 --> 51:54.610
[shrieks loudly]

51:59.184 --> 52:02.882
[Watchers chittering]

52:06.822 --> 52:11.198
- [footsteps thudding]
- [chittering]

52:25.340 --> 52:27.808
[squealing]

52:32.548 --> 52:34.287
Don't move, it will be okay.

52:35.255 --> 52:38.820
[Watchers growling, shrieking]

52:38.955 --> 52:42.229
They're not here!
They're not in here with us!

52:42.964 --> 52:45.430
[chittering, screeching]

52:52.636 --> 52:55.869
They're looking for us.
[panting]

52:56.604 --> 52:57.772
[whispers] Let's go.

52:59.980 --> 53:01.075
[Mina] Daniel!

53:01.210 --> 53:02.412
Danny!

53:02.548 --> 53:04.251
[Madeline]
Open the door, Daniel.

53:05.150 --> 53:06.651
Danny, please!

53:06.787 --> 53:09.082
[Madeline] We don't have
much time. Do you understand?

53:09.985 --> 53:12.254
- Daniel!
- Daniel, please listen to me.

53:12.390 --> 53:13.590
I know that you're angry.

53:15.129 --> 53:16.328
[Watchers growling faintly]

53:16.463 --> 53:17.957
Did I ever tell you
about my sister?

53:19.428 --> 53:20.861
Her name is Lucy.

53:21.936 --> 53:23.567
She tries calling.

53:24.600 --> 53:26.801
Our mom died when we were young.

53:27.871 --> 53:31.542
I've never told anyone,
but it was my fault.

53:33.943 --> 53:36.276
I don't think
I'm a good person, Daniel.

53:36.411 --> 53:37.516
But you are.

53:38.753 --> 53:40.682
And you don't know what a thing
like this will do to you.

53:40.818 --> 53:42.784
It'll haunt you
for the rest of your life.

53:44.623 --> 53:47.525
Please, Danny,
I don't want to die.

53:50.358 --> 53:51.364
Please.

53:52.627 --> 53:56.270
[shrieking approaches]

53:57.773 --> 53:59.339
[Mina sighs]

54:02.505 --> 54:03.777
How stupid can you be?

54:03.912 --> 54:04.870
Stay away from me.

54:05.006 --> 54:06.209
I should've killed you
months ago.

54:06.345 --> 54:07.809
Come on, leave him alone.

54:08.542 --> 54:09.777
They're coming!

54:09.913 --> 54:10.750
[Madeline]
We've broken too many rules.

54:11.486 --> 54:13.012
In front of the mirror now, everybody.

54:15.856 --> 54:19.626
I told you I'd never lie to you
and I haven't, not really.

54:19.761 --> 54:22.956
But there are some truths that
I had hoped to protect you from.

54:24.363 --> 54:26.160
I taught history on the outside.

54:26.996 --> 54:29.402
Folklore, mythology,
that kind of thing.

54:30.605 --> 54:34.275
Unlike the rest of you,
I came here because I wanted to.

54:35.043 --> 54:36.839
I knew what was inside.

54:36.974 --> 54:39.611
It was only the night I saw one
for the first time

54:39.746 --> 54:43.449
that I knew how grave
the danger of this place.

54:43.918 --> 54:44.978
You've seen one?

54:46.421 --> 54:48.652
I hunted on my own
in those days.

54:50.318 --> 54:52.755
The sun was setting
as I rushed back to the Coop.

54:53.688 --> 54:55.428
I cut it too close.

54:56.196 --> 54:57.496
Then I heard something.

54:59.468 --> 55:04.063
When I pushed
through the trees, well...

55:05.541 --> 55:07.407
<i>I thought I'd finally
lost my mind.</i>

55:08.008 --> 55:09.374
[chittering]

55:09.510 --> 55:11.543
[Ciara]
<i>What was it? What did you see?</i>

55:12.311 --> 55:13.479
[Madeline] <i>I saw...</i>

55:14.411 --> 55:15.646
<i>...myself.</i>

55:21.452 --> 55:22.818
<i>Not a perfect replica.</i>

55:24.589 --> 55:26.888
<i>Everything was sort of... off.</i>

55:27.856 --> 55:30.925
<i>And it was longer, leaner.</i>

55:32.860 --> 55:34.533
[Ciara] That's not possible.

55:34.668 --> 55:37.697
The Watchers
are a very ancient species,

55:37.833 --> 55:40.071
the things of legend and lore.

55:40.207 --> 55:42.501
They go by many names...

55:42.636 --> 55:44.372
Changelings.

55:44.507 --> 55:45.874
The Winged People.

55:46.881 --> 55:48.107
Fairies.

55:49.378 --> 55:50.480
Fairies?

55:50.615 --> 55:53.116
Yes. This is why they watch us.

55:53.251 --> 55:54.152
[growling]

55:54.288 --> 55:55.749
<i>They're studying us</i>

55:55.884 --> 55:57.483
<i>so that they can become us.</i>

55:58.253 --> 56:00.993
<i>We are their playthings,
their muses.</i>

56:01.629 --> 56:03.864
And that is why
they will never let us leave.

56:03.999 --> 56:05.564
[banging on door]

56:06.563 --> 56:07.698
[Ciara's voice] John?

56:08.697 --> 56:10.166
I'm so sorry, honey.

56:10.301 --> 56:11.700
[heavy knocking]

56:11.836 --> 56:12.965
[Ciara's voice]
What book am I reading?

56:13.101 --> 56:14.671
[breathless]
Is that one of them?

56:14.807 --> 56:16.040
[Madeline]
Tricky beasts, aren't they?

56:16.175 --> 56:17.644
[thumping]

56:17.779 --> 56:20.213
[Madeline's voice] Nightmares.
We all get them here.

56:20.349 --> 56:21.411
- Come sleep by us.
- [thumps]

56:21.547 --> 56:23.415
[Daniel's voice] Good evening.

56:23.551 --> 56:25.110
What a show
we have for you tonight.

56:25.246 --> 56:27.683
Yeah. We're all
on the edge of our seats.

56:27.819 --> 56:31.117
- [feet tapping]
- [Watchers chittering]

56:32.192 --> 56:33.455
- [bangs]
- [gasps]

56:33.590 --> 56:34.859
[Mina's voice] Daniel.

56:35.395 --> 56:36.993
- Daniel.
- [rapid banging]

56:37.129 --> 56:38.190
Daniel!

56:38.793 --> 56:40.027
They're going to get in.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.236
[Madeline]
The door isn't going to hold.

56:46.372 --> 56:47.939
Try not to die. [chirps]

56:48.074 --> 56:49.508
[Romeo's voice] Like, she's
just got that look about her,

56:49.644 --> 56:51.241
that kind of like,
feral almost, look.

56:51.377 --> 56:52.677
[Ciara] What's that?

56:53.909 --> 56:57.346
[sniffing, scratching outside]

56:57.481 --> 56:58.551
[Mina] Oh, my God.

56:59.186 --> 57:01.153
[feet tapping]

57:01.288 --> 57:02.115
[Madeline] Be careful!

57:04.524 --> 57:05.655
There's something underneath.

57:05.791 --> 57:06.992
[Ciara]
Has anyone seen this before?

57:07.128 --> 57:08.028
[Madeline] No!

57:08.163 --> 57:09.263
[Mina] What do we do?

57:09.398 --> 57:11.160
[screeching,
banging continue]

57:11.529 --> 57:12.529
[Ciara] Oh, my God.

57:12.664 --> 57:13.999
They're going to
break the glass.

57:14.769 --> 57:15.696
[Madeline's voice]
If you care for your life,

57:15.831 --> 57:16.662
you're going to have to run.

57:16.797 --> 57:19.231
[banging outside]

57:19.366 --> 57:20.570
[Mina's voice]
I'm not supposed to be here.

57:20.705 --> 57:22.107
I'm the one that's getting out.

57:22.243 --> 57:24.170
[screeching outside]

57:33.989 --> 57:34.785
It's a door!

57:35.754 --> 57:37.920
- Open it.
- [Madeline] Wait! Wait!

57:39.289 --> 57:41.359
- [banging continues]
- [human-like shouting outside]

57:41.495 --> 57:43.563
[overlapping screams outside]

57:49.136 --> 57:50.134
I'm going down.

57:50.269 --> 57:51.835
[heavy knocking]

57:53.569 --> 57:54.904
Hand me my bird.

57:58.145 --> 57:59.312
[Darwin chirps]

57:59.447 --> 58:01.713
[banging and shrieking outside]

58:03.744 --> 58:05.013
[Darwin chirps]

58:05.148 --> 58:07.114
- [banging on door]
- [Watchers shrieking]

58:09.117 --> 58:11.184
- [banging]
- [glass cracking]

58:12.687 --> 58:14.928
[metal creaking]

58:15.063 --> 58:16.827
[glass shatters]

58:31.607 --> 58:33.574
[panting]

58:33.709 --> 58:36.077
[Darwin chirping]

58:38.186 --> 58:39.278
[Daniel grunting]

58:45.386 --> 58:47.919
[Ciara] This was underneath us
the entire time!

58:48.055 --> 58:49.555
Look at all of this food!

58:50.358 --> 58:53.061
We can live like this for years.
No more hunting.

58:55.430 --> 58:57.497
[Ciara] It looks like
someone was studying them.

58:58.567 --> 59:00.640
[Daniel] I guess you didn't
know everything, Madeline.

59:08.009 --> 59:10.144
[computer clicks and whirs]

59:14.456 --> 59:15.721
[Ciara] Can you get a signal?

59:16.456 --> 59:17.690
[Mina] I don't think so.

59:21.790 --> 59:22.662
[clicks mouse]

59:27.366 --> 59:29.900
[man sighs]

59:33.541 --> 59:35.169
<i>Professor Rory Kilmartin.</i>

59:36.444 --> 59:38.540
<i>24th of September, 2009.</i>

59:38.676 --> 59:40.574
It's him. The Professor.

59:40.709 --> 59:41.677
[pouring drink]

59:41.813 --> 59:43.244
<i>Today marks the beginning</i>

59:43.380 --> 59:45.586
<i>of my greatest,
most singular achievement.</i>

59:46.488 --> 59:48.050
<i>My impenetrable fortress,</i>

59:48.186 --> 59:51.086
<i>here in the center
of their habitat.</i>

59:52.460 --> 59:55.024
<i>I call it, "Wonderland."</i>

59:57.028 --> 59:58.298
<i>They come
and see me every night</i>

59:58.433 --> 59:59.327
<i>as I thought they would.</i>

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.928
<i>They just stand there
at the glass, watching.</i>

01:00:03.063 --> 01:00:04.297
<i>Completely still.</i>

01:00:05.733 --> 01:00:07.773
<i>It's almost as if
they can't help themselves.</i>

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.040
<i>They are fascinated with me.</i>

01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:13.911
[monitor clicks]

01:00:15.843 --> 01:00:17.717

[breathes shakily]

01:00:20.254 --> 01:00:21.314
<i>0900.</i>

01:00:23.154 --> 01:00:25.120
<i>Last night
was the worst night yet.</i>

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:28.728
<i>They are mastering me.</i>

01:00:30.998 --> 01:00:32.832
<i>At first,
they made sizeable mistakes.</i>

01:00:32.968 --> 01:00:34.833
<i>They got the proportions
of my eyes wrong.</i>

01:00:36.135 --> 01:00:37.935
<i>They miscounted
the number of my fingers.</i>

01:00:39.038 --> 01:00:41.400
<i>But the Watchers
are fast learners now.</i>

01:00:42.541 --> 01:00:44.106
[ragged breathing]

01:00:44.242 --> 01:00:46.306
<i>I think I might have to
treat the glass.</i>

01:00:53.219 --> 01:00:55.154
[Kilmartin] <i>For years,
my colleagues mocked me</i>

01:00:55.289 --> 01:00:58.153
<i>as I meticulously planned
the creation of Wonderland.</i>

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:01.859
<i>Machines wouldn't work
until I had a generator.</i>

01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:03.994
<i>So, I had to rely
on manual labor.</i>

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.161
<i>Thirteen a day.</i>

01:01:06.297 --> 01:01:08.196
<i>No more, no less.
That was the rule.</i>

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.163
<i>Men from neighboring towns
and villages.</i>

01:01:11.298 --> 01:01:14.169
<i>Men with no money, no family.</i>

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.338
<i>And the end of each day,</i>

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:19.944
<i>I urged them

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:23.514
<i>...quietly slipped
into the bunker,</i>

01:01:23.649 --> 01:01:24.916
<i>sealed the hatch,</i>

01:01:26.119 --> 01:01:29.714
<i>waited for their screams
to subside.</i>

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:32.891
<i>This place was built
on the blood of innocent peopl.</i>

01:01:35.293 --> 01:01:38.798
<i>All in the pursuit of knowledg,
I suppose.</i>

01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:41.031
[Ciara] Oh, my God.

01:01:45.973 --> 01:01:47.835
<i>One of them appeared
to me today</i>

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:49.809
<i>in the form of a child.</i>

01:01:50.744 --> 01:01:52.911
<i>A little girl with red hair.</i>

01:01:54.247 --> 01:01:57.050
<i>This creature was different
from the others.</i>

01:01:57.586 --> 01:01:59.180
<i>It was traveling on its own.</i>

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:03.053
<i>It seemed curious,
innocent even.</i>

01:02:04.622 --> 01:02:07.922
<i>Imagine if you could access
all that perverted power.</i>

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.258
<i>The power of duplication.</i>

01:02:11.226 --> 01:02:13.261
<i>Imagine what one could do.</i>

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.968
<i>One could even cheat death.</i>

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:19.734
[Daniel] "Cheat death"?
What does he mean?

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.269
[Ciara] He's crazy.

01:02:22.377 --> 01:02:23.777

[Ciara] Come on.

01:03:43.823 --> 01:03:45.419
We don't have to watch this.

01:03:57.637 --> 01:03:59.873
[mouse scrolling]

01:04:04.712 --> 01:04:06.110
<i>Three-hundred days here.</i>

01:04:07.078 --> 01:04:08.607
<i>I used to think of myself...</i>

01:04:09.784 --> 01:04:10.846
<i>...as some kind of visionary.</i>

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:14.621
<i>But now, when I catch sight of
myself in the mirror upstairs,</i>

01:04:14.756 --> 01:04:16.682
<i>I'm repulsed at what I see.</i>

01:04:17.718 --> 01:04:19.453
<i>I've been stripped
of all humanity.</i>

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.090
<i>The creature
I have grown so fond of</i>

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:24.095
<i>is waiting for me upstairs.</i>

01:04:25.564 --> 01:04:27.830
<i>One bullet through the heart
should do the trick.</i>

01:04:27.966 --> 01:04:29.397
<i>Then one for myself.</i>

01:04:31.503 --> 01:04:33.832
<i>The boat should be
where I left it, shouldn't it?</i>

01:04:34.368 --> 01:04:37.603
<i>On the river, past 134,</i>

01:04:37.738 --> 01:04:39.572
<i>where the birds
leave the woods.</i>

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:43.884
<i>I know now that
it was never meant for me.</i>

01:04:44.984 --> 01:04:46.645

<i>Some things are
meant to be left in the past.</i>

01:05:04.132 --> 01:05:05.939
<i>As for me...</i>

01:05:08.506 --> 01:05:10.537

[sighs] We'll leave tomorrow.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.162
[Daniel] What are you doing?

01:06:05.198 --> 01:06:07.231
Well, if this is
our last night here...

01:06:08.363 --> 01:06:11.801
...we are going to dance.

01:06:11.937 --> 01:06:12.803
[cassette tape rattles]

01:06:12.938 --> 01:06:14.007
[chuckling] We're not.

["Young Hearts Run Free"

01:06:28.115 --> 01:06:29.253
Come on.

Come on!

01:06:31.592 --> 01:06:33.251
[both laughing]

01:06:33.387 --> 01:06:35.195
[Daniel] You're so lame.

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.326
[Ciara] Come on.

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:41.562
[music continues]

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:46.066
[Daniel]
No, I don't want to dance.

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:46.967
[Ciara] You're good.

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:48.540
[Daniel] Yeah.

01:06:48.675 --> 01:06:49.768
[Ciara chuckles]

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.313
[music fades]

01:07:00.448 --> 01:07:02.022
[Daniel] Daddy was a drunk.

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:05.520
Did you know that?

01:07:08.489 --> 01:07:10.393
He shattered my nose twice.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:13.759
Broke a couple of ribs.

01:07:15.896 --> 01:07:18.632
He usually passed out cold
on the couch.

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.805
So one night I left.

01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:25.210
I took the keys to his bike
and left.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.511
I thought that if I stayed...

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.249
[murmurs]

01:07:32.284 --> 01:07:33.746
...I think
I would have killed him.

01:07:39.253 --> 01:07:40.588
Hey, hey.

01:07:41.456 --> 01:07:43.723
Hey, if we get out of here,

01:07:45.199 --> 01:07:46.792
then you can come
and stay with me.

01:07:48.162 --> 01:07:49.234
Okay?

01:08:03.477 --> 01:08:06.549
[rattling, squeaking]

01:08:07.352 --> 01:08:09.254

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:25.105
Everyone ready?

01:08:26.806 --> 01:08:28.141
It's time to go.

01:08:47.992 --> 01:08:50.323
[Madeline] <i>The forest will do
everything in its power</i>

01:08:50.458 --> 01:08:51.791
<i>to keep us inside.</i>

01:08:52.759 --> 01:08:54.731
<i>To distract us from our path.</i>

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:58.666
<i>Remember what is real
and what is not.</i>

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.273
<i>We move together as one.</i>

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.420
[Madeline] This is it.

01:09:18.385 --> 01:09:19.819
No turning back.

01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:26.160
[Mina whispering]
Come on, Darwin.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:27.761
We'll follow your lead.

01:09:30.705 --> 01:09:31.402
[Darwin chirps]

01:09:56.364 --> 01:09:58.594
[Daniel]
There's something there.
Up ahead.

01:10:02.035 --> 01:10:03.161
[Mina] What is that?

01:10:03.597 --> 01:10:04.799
[Madeline] Unbelievable.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:08.538
This must be where
the fairies were imprisoned.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.606
It is said that they once
lived among us as gods,

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.940
the bridge
between nature and man.

01:10:15.075 --> 01:10:17.916
But over time,
the power of the changelings

01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:19.544
began to frighten us.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.387
Human and Fey were at war.

01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:28.657
They were banished
to a tomb deep underground,

01:10:29.723 --> 01:10:32.730
sealed in by a great door

01:10:32.865 --> 01:10:36.297
that prevented them from ever
returning the way they came in.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.034
[human-like screaming]

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:39.703
[screams stop, echoing]

01:10:39.839 --> 01:10:42.871
[Madeline] For centuries,
they clawed towards the surface

01:10:43.007 --> 01:10:46.541
only to discover they had
lost their wings, their magic,

01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:48.545
and could never leave
this forest.

01:10:49.148 --> 01:10:50.008
We need to keep moving.

01:10:50.952 --> 01:10:52.318
[breathing heavily]

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:09.632
It's so cold.

01:11:11.171 --> 01:11:13.564
We'll make it. Stay with us.

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:14.905
[Madeline] Stay with us.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.275
[giggling]

01:11:16.411 --> 01:11:18.476
[young Mina] Hey, Lucy,
you're going too fast.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.709
[Darwin chirps]

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:23.411
It's getting dark, Madeline.

01:11:23.547 --> 01:11:24.647
[Madeline] We still have time.

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:28.717
[rain pattering]

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:33.522
- We'll never make it in this.
- [Madeline] We have to.

01:11:33.658 --> 01:11:35.827
Stay close, everyone.
Stay close.

01:11:35.962 --> 01:11:37.693
[Darwin squawks]

01:11:38.228 --> 01:11:39.299
Keep moving.

01:11:40.501 --> 01:11:42.764
We'll be there any minute,
I can feel it.

01:11:44.201 --> 01:11:45.471
Any minute.

01:11:45.973 --> 01:11:49.309
[birds screeching]

[Watchers growling]

01:11:55.614 --> 01:11:57.614
[Madeline]
We need to run. Let's go.

01:11:58.646 --> 01:12:01.849
[growls, screeches]

01:12:02.984 --> 01:12:04.687
- [Madeline] Keep moving!

01:12:05.519 --> 01:12:06.755
[screeching]

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:08.486
[Madeline] Don't look back.

01:12:08.622 --> 01:12:10.425
[all panting]

01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:11.529
[Madeline] We're almost there.

01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:17.233
[Ciara] We're almost there.
[gasps]

01:12:17.902 --> 01:12:19.801
- [Ciara] Danny, hurry up!
- [Madeline] Don't stop!

01:12:24.871 --> 01:12:26.709
[Daniel] Oh, there it is.

01:12:32.384 --> 01:12:33.648
[Daniel chuckles] We're out.

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:37.219
We actually made it out.
We made it out!

01:12:37.355 --> 01:12:39.018
[Daniel, Ciara laughing]

01:12:40.292 --> 01:12:41.422
[Mina] There's the boat.

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.159
[Watchers screeching]

01:12:43.294 --> 01:12:44.595
[Madeline] Go! Go.

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:48.797
[man] Daniel!

01:12:51.135 --> 01:12:52.064
Wait!

01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:55.133
Hey!

01:12:56.173 --> 01:12:56.937
Daniel.

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:11.050
- I can't get the chain.
- Coming.

01:13:13.488 --> 01:13:14.489
[exhales]

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:16.594
Wait, where-- where's Daniel?

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.861
[Daniel grunting]

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.901
[Daniel groans]

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.035
[Daniel] John.

01:13:30.243 --> 01:13:32.370
John, Ciara's worried.

01:13:32.806 --> 01:13:35.042
Daniel, it's not John!

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.780
- Ciara's gonna be so happy.
- [Ciara] It's not him!

01:13:36.915 --> 01:13:39.751
[John double] Daniel, please,
take me with you.

01:13:39.886 --> 01:13:42.218
- Oh, my God, he can't hear us.
- I'm going to get him!

01:13:42.354 --> 01:13:43.689
We don't have time.

01:13:43.825 --> 01:13:45.124
[grunts]

01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:47.457
Daniel! Run! It's not John!

01:13:47.592 --> 01:13:49.094
[Daniel] Come on, John, get up.

01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:50.925
- [screams]
- Daniel!

01:13:52.259 --> 01:13:55.426
- Get in the boat!
- Daniel, run! Daniel!

01:13:55.562 --> 01:13:56.601
Daniel!

01:13:57.538 --> 01:14:00.939
[John double speaks
Old Gaelic]

01:14:01.074 --> 01:14:03.476
[Daniel screams]

01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:07.040
We'll wait as long as we can.
Get in the boat.

01:14:08.115 --> 01:14:08.877
[Ciara gasps]

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.347
- [Watcher chittering]
- [gasps]

01:14:11.783 --> 01:14:13.281
- Look away. Look away.
- [Ciara cries]

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:15.719
[gulps, groans]

01:14:16.353 --> 01:14:17.083
[Ciara] Daniel!

01:14:17.618 --> 01:14:18.821
[body thuds]

01:14:34.768 --> 01:14:35.840
Can they swim?

01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:38.236
[Madeline]
They cannot leave the forest.

01:14:38.372 --> 01:14:40.975
- [Mina] Are you sure?
- [Madeline] I'm sure.

01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:53.988
[screeching]

Wake up.

Where is this bus going?

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:57.557
This bus goes
all the way to Galway.

01:15:58.919 --> 01:16:00.824
Can you take us there?

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.724
Excuse me, sir.

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:36.024
Could you turn that up?

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.644
[Mina] I'll go to the university
tomorrow,

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.142
and I'll do
as Kilmartin asked, and...

01:16:56.309 --> 01:16:58.145
...we can just
put this all behind us.

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:01.654
Okay.

01:17:05.257 --> 01:17:06.153
Okay.

01:17:07.127 --> 01:17:08.023
Okay.

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.095
What happened?

01:18:24.405 --> 01:18:26.134

Mina, why did you do that?

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:38.850

to keep your uncle's research

They say
he really believed it all.

01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:09.243
He did.

Oh, there he is.

01:19:14.787 --> 01:19:16.954
- Old Uncle Rory.

<i>A detailed account

01:20:20.584 --> 01:20:24.450
<i>A time before the Fey

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.161
<i>Life with the fairies was
a golden era in the age of man.</i>

01:20:30.297 --> 01:20:34.559
<i>They lived among us as
guardians, friends, even mates.</i>

<i>Those half-blooded children,</i>

01:20:37.469 --> 01:20:40.866
<i>born of both man and fairy,
changed everything.</i>

01:20:42.102 --> 01:20:45.274

Yeah, I think this is it.
Thank you.

01:22:43.991 --> 01:22:44.858
Hi.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.130
[Mina] Hi.

01:22:48.066 --> 01:22:49.430
I have to show you something.

01:22:51.537 --> 01:22:52.433
Okay.

01:22:54.275 --> 01:22:57.509
Kilmartin's office was left
completely as it was.

01:22:57.644 --> 01:22:58.903
Totally untouched.

01:23:00.107 --> 01:23:06.018
There were a lot of papers about
the Coop, Watchers, the forest.

01:23:06.952 --> 01:23:08.482
I took as much of it as I could.

01:23:10.283 --> 01:23:12.156
And I found these.

01:23:35.179 --> 01:23:36.642
I don't understand, that's...

01:23:37.377 --> 01:23:38.446
[whispers] Madeline.

01:23:40.987 --> 01:23:42.648
I asked the front desk, and...

01:23:43.883 --> 01:23:46.586
...Rory Kilmartin was married
to a woman.

01:23:47.354 --> 01:23:48.588
Her name was Madeline.

01:23:50.263 --> 01:23:53.197
She would have told us
if she was his wife.

01:23:55.098 --> 01:23:56.596
There's one more thing.

01:24:04.106 --> 01:24:05.610
What is this?

01:24:05.745 --> 01:24:07.046
It's an obituary.

01:24:08.546 --> 01:24:13.085
Madeline Kilmartin,
the woman in the photos...

01:24:14.984 --> 01:24:16.187
She died.

01:24:17.187 --> 01:24:20.092
In 2001, from lung cancer.

01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:21.693
No.

01:24:22.363 --> 01:24:24.861
He had one of them down there
in the bunker with him.

01:24:24.997 --> 01:24:26.124
Maybe there was a reason.

01:24:26.259 --> 01:24:27.491
It's impossible.

01:24:27.626 --> 01:24:30.060
We heard him kill it, didn't we?

01:24:30.196 --> 01:24:33.237
He knew what they could do,
that they could change form.

01:24:34.639 --> 01:24:37.406
Maybe he thought that
he could bring his wife back.

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:39.771
That he could make
a new Madeline.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.807
But they can't walk
in the sunlight.

01:24:42.943 --> 01:24:44.842
Well, she must be different
from the others.

01:24:47.547 --> 01:24:49.484
She's one of them, Ciara.

01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:53.653
Madeline is a Watcher.

01:25:01.967 --> 01:25:02.966
[Ciara] Where is she?

01:25:03.102 --> 01:25:04.664
Shouldn't she be here by now?

01:25:05.265 --> 01:25:06.501
She'll come.

01:25:07.301 --> 01:25:08.734
They always come.

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:13.112
We brought a monster out here,
Ciara.

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:15.741
We have to send her back.

01:25:22.823 --> 01:25:25.850
[fluttering, buzzing]

01:25:44.845 --> 01:25:46.211
[Mina] It's so quiet.

[vehicle approaches]

01:26:02.555 --> 01:26:04.163

[door closes]

01:26:20.407 --> 01:26:21.708
You're not Ciara.

01:26:28.153 --> 01:26:29.782
I haven't gotten it quite right.

01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.949
But I will in time.

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.823
Are you here to kill us?

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:37.827
I'm here to become you.

01:26:58.952 --> 01:27:00.549
We were like gods once.

01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:02.650
It is because of humans

01:27:02.786 --> 01:27:04.921
that we were smothered
under dirt for centuries.

01:27:05.056 --> 01:27:07.754
Choking, breaking,

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:10.658
forced to claw
through the earth like bugs.

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.993
[Daniel's voice]
You are no different, Mina.

01:27:15.128 --> 01:27:18.799
You are controlled
by your hatred, your jealousy.

01:27:18.935 --> 01:27:21.404
You cannot be trusted
now that you know my secret.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.642
[Mina] I won't tell anyone,
I promise.

01:27:24.244 --> 01:27:25.971
I would never hurt you,
Madeline.

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:28.138
[Daniel's voice] Humans
have made me promises before.

01:27:28.273 --> 01:27:31.614
[panting] You took care of us.
You protected us.

01:27:32.517 --> 01:27:34.352
We were like a family
in the Coop.

01:27:34.987 --> 01:27:36.488
You were my pets.

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:38.822
I was studying you up close.

01:27:38.957 --> 01:27:40.254
That's not true.

01:27:40.389 --> 01:27:41.354
I know you, Madeline.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:42.920
I'm grateful to you, Mina.

01:27:43.056 --> 01:27:44.656
Without you,
I would have been trapped

01:27:44.791 --> 01:27:46.825
in that forest for an eternity.

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:48.393
A prisoner
just like the rest of youse.

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:51.930
[Mina gasps, grunts]

01:27:56.235 --> 01:27:58.240
[Madeline] All my life
I dreamed of making it

01:27:58.376 --> 01:28:00.470
to the world beyond the woods.

01:28:00.606 --> 01:28:01.639
[Mina grunts]

01:28:01.774 --> 01:28:03.544
[Madeline] You have no idea

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.779
how much the others
made me suffer.

01:28:07.754 --> 01:28:11.983
<i>Ainriochtán</i> was the name
they gave me at my birth.

01:28:13.123 --> 01:28:14.924
The Strange One.

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.691
The Daywalker.

01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:18.722
The Deformity.

01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:20.595
[stretching, bones cracking]

01:28:20.731 --> 01:28:23.301
When the Professor
came to the forest,

01:28:23.437 --> 01:28:25.865
I thought things
might finally change.

01:28:27.401 --> 01:28:29.774
[voice distorting] He promised
he would show me the way out.

01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:32.674
[Kilmartin's voice] Then
the bastard tried to shoot me.

01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:35.742
I had no choice but to kill him.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.013
I will not be betrayed again,
Mina.

01:28:38.148 --> 01:28:38.944
[bones cracking]

01:28:45.451 --> 01:28:46.721
Ciara!

[gasps]

01:29:18.657 --> 01:29:20.491
[Mina's voice]
You can't run anymore, Mina.

01:29:25.825 --> 01:29:27.564
Let's end this as equals.

01:29:55.195 --> 01:29:57.093
- [growls]
- [gasps]

01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:59.464
I am <i>Ainriochtán.</i>

01:30:00.363 --> 01:30:01.697
The Daywalker.

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:05.228
The one to make it out.

01:30:05.364 --> 01:30:07.769
I will walk amongst the humans
in your body.

01:30:08.672 --> 01:30:10.541
No one
will notice the difference.

01:30:11.643 --> 01:30:13.610
I can take away
all your suffering.

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:16.877
[Mina gasping]

01:30:18.143 --> 01:30:20.248
You don't have to do this.
[gasps]

01:30:20.384 --> 01:30:21.278
Look at yourself, Mina.

01:30:22.214 --> 01:30:24.716
- You abandoned your sister.
- [gasps]

01:30:24.851 --> 01:30:26.458
You killed your own mother.

01:30:27.491 --> 01:30:29.419
Are you really worth saving?

01:30:29.555 --> 01:30:32.090
[groans]

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:38.866
Kilmartin never told you,
did he?

01:30:39.972 --> 01:30:40.631
What?

01:30:41.467 --> 01:30:43.733
He never told you why
you can walk in the daylight.

01:30:44.603 --> 01:30:47.039
Why you could leave the forest
when the others couldn't.

01:30:48.274 --> 01:30:50.515
- [grunts]
- What are you talking about?

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:55.153
There was a recording
at the university.

01:30:55.288 --> 01:30:56.785
I think I understand it now.

01:30:57.819 --> 01:31:00.019
Our kinds used to live as one.

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:02.989
Some even fell in love
and had children.

01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:05.728
Kilmartin called them halflings.

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:10.162
I think the reason that
you can walk in the daylight

01:31:10.297 --> 01:31:13.466
is because you're not just
a Watcher, Madeline.

01:31:13.602 --> 01:31:15.067
You're also part human.

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:17.702
I don't believe you.

01:31:17.837 --> 01:31:19.607
You must have felt it.

01:31:19.742 --> 01:31:21.678
That you never really belonged.

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:27.745
You know what it is to be human,
don't you? [panting]

01:31:27.881 --> 01:31:30.082
It's jealousy and hatred.

01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:33.886
But it's also love
and forgiveness.

01:31:34.022 --> 01:31:35.219
[voice distorting]
Mina, stop it.

01:31:37.259 --> 01:31:39.190
I know what it's like
to believe you're a monster.

01:31:40.593 --> 01:31:44.468
I know what it's like to feel
that half of you is evil.

01:31:44.603 --> 01:31:48.003
- [groaning]
- [bones cracking]

01:31:48.139 --> 01:31:51.776
It can turn you into something
that you don't recognize.

01:31:51.912 --> 01:31:53.739
[groans]

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:57.714
You don't know me.
[croaks]

01:31:57.849 --> 01:32:00.519
I think there are others
like you out there.

01:32:01.717 --> 01:32:03.247
What if you could find them?

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:06.953
[gasping]

01:32:07.089 --> 01:32:09.022
[Mina] We don't have to
be alone anymore.

01:32:10.364 --> 01:32:14.027
[low, howling shriek echoing]

01:32:41.694 --> 01:32:43.793
[Madeline]
I hope you're right, Mina.

01:32:48.497 --> 01:32:50.096
[chittering]

01:32:58.044 --> 01:32:58.735
Ciara.

01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:00.473
Ciara, wake up.

01:33:00.609 --> 01:33:02.779
Please. Ciara.

01:33:04.116 --> 01:33:06.618
[grunts]

01:33:08.586 --> 01:33:10.655
I... I heard John's voice.

01:33:11.818 --> 01:33:14.285
I know. I'm here.

01:33:28.167 --> 01:33:30.169
[Mina] <i>Feels like a dream...</i>

01:33:31.810 --> 01:33:34.206
<i>...those days we spent
in the forest.</i>

01:33:37.179 --> 01:33:41.950
I think Madeline
still hangs around, watching me.

01:33:44.457 --> 01:33:46.152
She takes different forms.

01:33:48.592 --> 01:33:50.959
A little girl sometimes.

01:33:52.431 --> 01:33:54.061
I see her in crowds.

01:33:56.298 --> 01:33:59.099
Someone where something's
just a little off.

01:34:01.003 --> 01:34:03.202
Sometimes
I think I'm going crazy.

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:05.303
Knowing there are others
like her out there.

01:34:06.571 --> 01:34:09.208
I just hope she finds
what she's looking for.

01:34:11.011 --> 01:34:13.113
Well, it's over now, Meens.

01:34:14.721 --> 01:34:15.948
You went through
something traumatic,

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:18.250
it's normal to still be afraid.

01:34:20.052 --> 01:34:21.693
But you're safe now.

01:34:22.559 --> 01:34:23.622
[Mina] I know.

01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:24.960
You're right.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.628
I'm so glad you're here, Lucy.

01:34:28.764 --> 01:34:30.629
[footsteps approach]

01:34:30.764 --> 01:34:32.565
[giggling]

01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:34.101
What is this?

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.368
Can you show Auntie Mina?

01:34:40.610 --> 01:34:41.777
What is this?

01:34:41.913 --> 01:34:43.242
It's a picture
of you and Darwin.

01:34:45.649 --> 01:34:48.918
I love it. It's perfect.

01:34:54.887 --> 01:34:56.288
[squawking]
