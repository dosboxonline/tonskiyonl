[Woman] Do you know
the expression ''a man's man'' ?

01:04.596 --> 01:07.684
A man's man
is the leader of the pack.

01:07.767 --> 01:12.689
The kind of man other men
look up to, admire and emulate.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.652
A man's man
is the kind of man who...

01:16.735 --> 01:20.281
[Chuckles] just doesn 't get
what women are about.

01:20.364 --> 01:25.787
Nick, my ex-husband,
is the ultimate man's man.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.789
I probably never
should have married him.

01:27.872 --> 01:29.875
I don't think he understood
a thing about me.

01:29.958 --> 01:33.170
So, this is Nick Marshall's office.
Wanna peek ?

01:33.253 --> 01:35.214
Don't worry.
He never gets in before 10:00.

01:35.255 --> 01:38.092
He'll send you on more errands than
anyone in the entire company...

01:38.175 --> 01:40.094
'cause he can't do
anything for himself.

01:40.177 --> 01:44.098
He's the least politically
correct guy in the universe.

01:44.182 --> 01:46.434
He's the king of all
the T & A ads we do.

01:46.518 --> 01:48.687
You want babes in bikinis ?
He's your man.

01:48.770 --> 01:52.316
My dad ? How can I
best describe him ?

01:52.399 --> 01:55.444
He's always been...
like an uncle to me.

01:55.527 --> 01:57.696
Yeah, Uncle Dad.

01:57.738 --> 02:00.950
Although,
Nick was a charmer.

02:01.033 --> 02:04.203
Completely irresistible
at first,

02:04.245 --> 02:08.041
which feeds into
the whole ''man's man'' thing.

02:08.083 --> 02:11.044
You know about
Nick's mother, right ?

02:11.086 --> 02:14.840
Because once you understand
about Nick's mother,

02:14.923 --> 02:17.218
you understand Nick.

02:20.263 --> 02:24.851
[Woman] Nick was actually
born and raised in Las Vegas.

02:24.934 --> 02:29.981
Nick's mother was a real,
honest-to-God Las Vegas showgirl.

02:30.065 --> 02:34.820
When otherboys were outside
riding their bikes and playing ball,

02:34.903 --> 02:39.241
Nick was backstage
hanging with the girls.

02:39.283 --> 02:42.954
He was their mascot,
their little pet.

02:43.037 --> 02:46.958
They couldn 't get enough
of those baby blues.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.960
- Bang ! Bang !
- [ Laughs ]

02:51.171 --> 02:54.425
lf you ask me, I'd say Nick's
mother just about killed it...

02:54.466 --> 02:56.760
for every woman
Nick would ever meet.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.931
She had a lot of sugardaddies
in her life,

03:00.014 --> 03:02.809
but only one true love--

03:02.892 --> 03:05.645
the boy
with the family jewels.

03:07.022 --> 03:09.691
17, 18, 19, 20.
Let me see that, kid.

03:09.775 --> 03:11.693
And since Nick
didn 't have a father,

03:11.777 --> 03:16.323
his mom made sure he was always
surrounded by strong role models.

03:16.407 --> 03:18.325
- Come here, huh ?
- [ Screams ]

03:18.409 --> 03:21.078
- Men her boy could look up to.
- Now you're ready, huh ?

03:22.663 --> 03:24.582
Keep countin', kid.

03:24.666 --> 03:27.335
There was nothing normal about
the way Nick Marshall was raised.

03:28.837 --> 03:31.423
So, what can you expect ?

03:31.506 --> 03:33.759
You don't have to be Freud
to figure out...

03:33.842 --> 03:36.971
this was one cockeyed way
to enter the world.

03:58.035 --> 04:02.832
[ Groaning ]

04:09.464 --> 04:11.383
Oh !

04:13.051 --> 04:14.553
Don't you ever knock ?

04:15.930 --> 04:18.182
It's almost 10:00. You gotta go
to work, and I gotta vacuum in here.

04:18.265 --> 04:21.017
And don't forget - Another one
who wears vanilla perfume.

04:21.101 --> 04:24.188
Don't you know any women
who don't want to smell like candy ?

04:24.272 --> 04:26.900
- Toss me my lighter, babe ?
- Babe ?

04:26.941 --> 04:29.110
What am I,
a little pig ?

04:29.194 --> 04:31.321
I don't have time
to make you no onion bagel,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.323
so please do not start
to beg, okay ?

04:33.407 --> 04:36.952
And for the record, l don't like
finding these things in your sofa.

04:37.036 --> 04:39.455
What kind of woman
wears underwear like this ?

04:39.497 --> 04:41.791
Hey, my mother wore
underwear like that.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.960
Just put them somewhere,
will you, babe ?

04:44.043 --> 04:47.088
Well, ''babe'' is gonna put it
in the trash where it belongs.

04:47.130 --> 04:49.090
- So, your mother should excuse me.
- [ Sighs ]

04:49.132 --> 04:51.301
Did you ever consider dating
a woman who wears real underwear?

04:51.385 --> 04:54.805
The kind that covers the entire
bottom the way it's supposed to ?

04:54.888 --> 04:57.725
- No. But if I do, should I call ?
- Oh !

04:58.976 --> 05:01.604
I'm gonna go clean
the kitchen.

05:01.646 --> 05:03.606
You couldn't toast me
a little bagel, could you ?

05:03.648 --> 05:05.984
Light cream cheese, tomatoes.
Capers if we have any.

05:06.067 --> 05:08.945
Please! Come on.
l can't think on an empty stomach.

05:08.987 --> 05:12.282
Okay. Allright. But only because
you didn 't call me that pig name.

05:12.324 --> 05:14.326
Okay, you got it, babe.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.419
Mr. Marshall,
how are you doing today ?

05:23.503 --> 05:25.880
- I'm fit as a dancing bear.
- I'll get that cab for you.

05:25.964 --> 05:28.717
- [ Whistles ]
- That's some set of pipes you got.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.638
- You have an excellent day, sir.
- And you.

05:35.265 --> 05:38.102
At ease.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.787
- [ Gasps ]
- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry !

05:54.870 --> 05:56.747
I absolutely
did not mean to do that.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.749
- Here. Let me get that for you.
- It's okay.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.918
No, I'm mortified.
I can see your hands are full.

06:01.002 --> 06:03.212
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Let me get the door.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.215
[ Grunts ]

06:05.298 --> 06:07.217
- [ Giggles ] Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.845
Halfcup, grande, nonfat,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

06:09.928 --> 06:13.015
''Halfcaff,'' grande, nonfat,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

06:13.056 --> 06:15.559
- So, when do you find out ?
- Um, today, I think.

06:15.643 --> 06:20.231
Unless I didn't get it, and then
I will just never find out.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.734
I'm sure I didn't get it. They were
looking for an ''earth mother'' type.

06:22.775 --> 06:25.570
I overheard the director
say I was more space cadet.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.073
I'm an actress.
I can be whatever you want.

06:28.156 --> 06:30.575
- Is that true, can you ?
- Oh, better be true.

06:30.617 --> 06:33.412
Otherwise, I'm stuck playing ditsy
coffee girl the rest of my life.

06:33.495 --> 06:36.624
Thank you.
Hon ? Thanks.

06:36.707 --> 06:40.920
Oh ! Hi, Nick. Hi.

06:41.003 --> 06:44.132
Oh, Lola, my love. When are you
gonna let me buy you dinner ?

06:44.215 --> 06:46.760
Nick, I don't know why you don't
believe me. I'm not your type.

06:46.843 --> 06:50.097
Trust me on this one. Cappuccino,
extra foam. Tall or grande ?

06:50.180 --> 06:53.141
Grande. Or at least
I like to think so.

06:53.225 --> 06:55.227
- Next.
- You know, rumor has it...

06:55.311 --> 06:57.772
I'm getting some really
big news at work today.

06:57.855 --> 07:00.691
At least come out with me.
Celebrate. I'll buy you a coffee.

07:00.775 --> 07:03.069
Memo to you:
I work in a coffee shop.

07:03.111 --> 07:05.071
Hi. What can I get you ?

07:05.113 --> 07:07.282
- Hi. I'll take--
- Want me to stop asking you out ?

07:07.365 --> 07:09.284
Sorry. This will
just take a sec.

07:09.367 --> 07:12.204
Because, Lola,
give me the word and I'll stop.

07:12.287 --> 07:15.833
Yes, I'm gonna give you the word
because I'm an actress.

07:15.916 --> 07:19.253
Or at least I'm trying to be one.
I'm trying to concentrate on that.

07:19.295 --> 07:22.423
So, you know, it would be
a good thing, if you wouldn't mind,

07:22.465 --> 07:24.425
to stop asking me out !

07:25.593 --> 07:27.721
Honey, you seem
so stressed.

07:27.804 --> 07:29.931
I am stressed.
I have a lot on my plate.

07:30.015 --> 07:31.975
So, let's not talk
about this now.

07:32.017 --> 07:34.311
Why don't I meet you here,
say, tomorrow ? 1 0:00 ? 1 0:30 ?

07:34.395 --> 07:36.397
- Okay, that would be good.
- So, that's a date ?

07:36.480 --> 07:39.775
It's a date.
Thank you.

07:39.817 --> 07:42.528
Sir,
that was inspiring.

07:42.612 --> 07:44.530
I know.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.159
[Woman]
Good morning, Sloane-Curtis.

07:48.243 --> 07:50.162
- Good morning, Mr. Marshall.
- Hi, honey.

07:50.245 --> 07:52.164
- What's the dirt ?
- I was at breakfast this morning--

07:52.247 --> 07:54.249
- Hey, Norm ! You winning ?
- Of course.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.169
I heard Miller's shopping around,
looking for a new agency.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.171
Miller Lite. I know.
I'm all over it.

07:59.213 --> 08:02.508
Also, I heard Darcy McGuire left
B.B.D. & O. Good morning, Angela.

08:02.592 --> 08:04.510
-You're kidding. Left or was fired ?
-I don't know.

08:04.594 --> 08:06.554
Everyone there
is thrilled to get rid of her.

08:06.638 --> 08:09.808
Well, so much for
edgy female vision.

08:09.850 --> 08:12.144
So, that girl we met
last night at the club,

08:12.185 --> 08:14.438
nothing happened after
you put her in the cab, right ?

08:14.521 --> 08:16.732
It did ?
Something happened ?

08:16.815 --> 08:18.818
But she said she had to
be in bed early.

08:18.901 --> 08:21.612
I had her in bed by 11:00.
Or was it quarter to ?

08:21.696 --> 08:23.615
You - You're like a genius,
you know that ?

08:23.698 --> 08:27.327
What can I tell you, buddy ? I'm
blessed. And today is my lucky day.

08:27.410 --> 08:31.498
Not only is my ex-wife remarrying--
right now, as a matter of fact--

08:31.581 --> 08:34.168
but Wanamaker called me himself,
wanted to see me first thing.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.837
- Called twice to confirm.
- Call me when he makes it official.

08:36.879 --> 08:40.799
It's not gonna be as easy to suck up
to ''creative director,'' you know.

08:40.883 --> 08:43.970
Not to worry. I'll make us a lunch
rez at the Drake to celebrate.

08:44.053 --> 08:47.390
Don't count your chickens,
huh ? 1:00 ?

08:47.474 --> 08:49.601
Pick you up.

08:49.684 --> 08:51.603
Can I borrow this ?

08:57.401 --> 08:59.403
- Hey, Dina.
- Hi.

08:59.487 --> 09:01.739
Do you know the difference
between a wife and a job ?

09:01.781 --> 09:04.075
- What is it ?
- After ten years, job still sucks.

09:04.117 --> 09:06.286
- [ Laughing ]
- That's a good one, huh ?

09:06.369 --> 09:09.581
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
That's not a good idea, no.

09:10.832 --> 09:12.751
- Oh, Mr. Marshall, hi.
- Hey.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.587
I put the storyboards on your desk.
Picked up your shoes from Barney's.

09:15.671 --> 09:17.590
Got your glasses fixed.
There was no charge.

09:17.673 --> 09:19.592
This morning's staff meeting
was cancelled.

09:19.675 --> 09:21.594
And I got your cigarettes.
They're next to your laptop.

09:21.677 --> 09:23.638
This morning's staff meeting
was cancelled.

09:23.721 --> 09:26.391
- That's what I was told.
- Hmm.

09:26.433 --> 09:30.520
Good morning, girls.
[ Chuckling ]

09:30.604 --> 09:32.814
Good afternoon, sire.

09:32.898 --> 09:35.859
Hey, anybody know why
the staff meeting was cancelled ?

09:35.943 --> 09:37.862
Nobody called us.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.740
Oh, but Mr. Wanamaker wants
to see you as soon as you get in,

09:40.781 --> 09:44.077
which I told his office
was 15 minutes ago.

09:44.118 --> 09:46.162
- I know.
- You couldn't show up on time ?

09:46.246 --> 09:49.374
You know you're being promoted.
But you look very sharp, by the way.

09:49.457 --> 09:51.376
- Thank you.
- Like a creative director.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.754
- Very distinguished.
- [ Exhales Deeply ]

09:53.796 --> 09:57.049
You able to handle yourselves
on the 44th floor ? Be truthful.

09:57.132 --> 09:59.510
Are you kidding ?
We were made for the 44th floor.

09:59.593 --> 10:02.597
Now, get up there already,
so we can break out the bubbly.

10:02.638 --> 10:05.058
- Don't wait up.
- [ Both ] Don't wait up.

10:05.141 --> 10:07.811
- He's so adorable.
- He says the cutest things.

10:10.313 --> 10:12.274
Boy.

10:14.067 --> 10:17.446
Sorry, buddy. I was in the board
meeting that would never end.

10:17.488 --> 10:19.699
- Have you been here long ?
- A couple minutes. That's all.

10:19.782 --> 10:22.118
Jess, can I get a cup of decaf
and a couple Tylenol?

10:22.160 --> 10:25.079
And see if we got any Echinacea.
And I need some club soda.

10:25.163 --> 10:29.292
I got something on my tie.
Know what ?Just get me another tie.

10:29.334 --> 10:33.630
I saw the mock-ups you did for
Johnny Walker. They're fantastic.

10:33.672 --> 10:35.925
Oh, that's my job, Dan.

10:36.008 --> 10:38.344
So, you know l'm not great
at making speeches,

10:38.427 --> 10:41.430
especially when I haven't
got you to write them for me.

10:41.514 --> 10:45.018
So, I'll do my best. I've been
in this racket over 30 years.

10:45.101 --> 10:47.145
Let me tell you something,
it doesn't get any easier.

10:47.228 --> 10:49.981
As a matter of fact,
it gets harder and harder.

10:50.023 --> 10:51.984
The '80s
were our glory days.

10:52.025 --> 10:55.070
They were all about
alcohol, tobacco and cars.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.656
I felt like
I was on top of my game.

10:57.698 --> 11:01.702
And then in the '90s, men stopped
dominating how dollars were spent,

11:01.786 --> 11:03.746
and we lost our compass.

11:03.830 --> 11:08.877
Women between 16 and 24 are
the fastest-growing consumer group.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.048
Girls who were born in the mid-'80s
control our advertising dollars.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.968
Sorry. No Echinacea.
Hi, Nick.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.596
- Hey.
- Red or lavender?

11:18.679 --> 11:21.474
Red. No, no, lavender.
That'sgood.

11:21.557 --> 11:25.228
Lavender's good. While we've been
shooting beer commercials...

11:25.311 --> 11:28.815
with the Swedish bikini team,
the industry has been transformed.

11:28.899 --> 11:31.735
We were the agency in town
ten years ago.

11:31.818 --> 11:34.613
Now we're struggling
to be third.

11:34.697 --> 11:37.700
lf we don't evolve and think
beyond our naturalability,

11:37.741 --> 11:40.328
we're gonna go down.

11:40.411 --> 11:44.249
''Think beyond our natural -''
I'm not quite clear what you mean.

11:44.332 --> 11:46.710
What do you know
about Darcy McGuire ?

11:46.751 --> 11:49.671
Oh, hey, l heard on the whisper
she just left B.B.D. & O.

11:49.754 --> 11:52.883
I never met the woman, but
I hear she's a real man-eater.

11:52.925 --> 11:55.511
She won that Cleo last year we
should have won for the add about--

11:55.594 --> 11:58.556
Oh, yeah, right.
That was her ? I forgot about that.

And what I learned there
was that any success I had...

of people that I work with.

53:22.663 --> 53:25.375
Yeah, they are.

53:25.458 --> 53:27.419
Wow. It's
a beautiful collection.

53:27.460 --> 53:30.213
- Thanks. So how's it going ?
- Mmm.

53:30.297 --> 53:32.424
You know, I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

53:32.507 --> 53:35.052
It's starting slow.

53:35.135 --> 53:37.888
- I'm evaluating staff, that's hard.
- Oh, yeah.

53:37.972 --> 53:39.932
Yeah, right.

53:48.608 --> 53:51.236
Well, you know, I don't
wanna beat around the bush.

- He's proposing so soon ?

53:54.781 --> 53:57.242
- Oh, sorry. Sorry. [ Chuckles ]
- Oh !

- Uh, yes--
- Excuse me.

- You got another one. Wow !
- [Darcy] Thanks.

[ Chuckling ]
As I was saying,

54:05.293 --> 54:08.964
I know nothing about the products
you're going for personally,

54:09.047 --> 54:11.591
but I do believe
I can sell anything...

54:11.675 --> 54:14.303
once I know
what the buyer's needs are.

54:14.386 --> 54:16.889
And what I'd really like,
with your kind indulgence of course,

54:16.972 --> 54:19.225
is to go after
that really big fish.

54:19.308 --> 54:21.310
I mean, the one
you really wanna land.

54:21.394 --> 54:23.312
I'll learn what I need to know,
and I'll reel them in for us.

54:23.396 --> 54:26.232
No, actually, I think
l'll reel them in for us.

54:26.316 --> 54:29.194
That is, unless you're going after
something in particular yourself.

54:29.277 --> 54:32.197
No. It's just that there're several
big fish out there at the moment.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.741
Oh, yeah ?
Well, what's your biggest fish ?

54:34.825 --> 54:37.786
To your mind,
who's your whale ?

54:37.870 --> 54:40.331
Um, Nike--
women's division ?

54:40.373 --> 54:42.667
You heard
they were shopping ?

54:42.708 --> 54:44.752

54:44.836 --> 54:47.630
- Amazing. I heard no one knew.
- You knew.

54:47.672 --> 54:51.676
- I heard no one else knew.
- It's okay if I know what you know.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.845
- We're on the same team. Besides,
- Yeah.

54:53.929 --> 54:55.973
I heard someone say once
two heads are better than one--

54:56.014 --> 54:59.477
- Oh, you were listening.
- More than you know.

54:59.560 --> 55:02.313
Okay,
here's what I heard.

55:02.396 --> 55:04.899
Nike is shopping,
quietly.

55:04.983 --> 55:07.652
But if they make a change,
it's gonna happen fast.

55:07.736 --> 55:09.946
Now, you know this is
a tough one for us to get.

55:10.030 --> 55:12.532
It would be a tough one for anybody
to get, but if we got it--

55:12.616 --> 55:14.827
- That's all we'd need.
- I hear you.

- I'm sorry.

- No, okay. I'm sorry.

- I understand. Go on.
- They wanna get in women's heads...

55:31.428 --> 55:34.014
and reach them
on a very real level.

jumpy talking about lipstick.

- I know.
- Nike is hard-core woman power.

go after this one ?

- Sure.

I want you to look at these boards
for U.S. Air before they come by.

55:57.581 --> 56:00.710
- Right.
- lt feels like something's missing.

56:00.751 --> 56:02.753
Hmm. I don't like
the graphics.

56:02.795 --> 56:05.006
Feels a bit parochial.

56:05.089 --> 56:07.008
Maybe it should be
in black and white.

56:07.091 --> 56:10.887
- What do you think, Nick ?
- I don't know who you've had,

56:10.929 --> 56:13.473
but, I don't know,
it seems kind of--

56:13.557 --> 56:15.934
What's the word ?
Parochial to me.

56:15.976 --> 56:18.270
Um, what do you think,
Darcy ?

56:18.312 --> 56:21.065
I totally agree,
especially about the graphics.

They're parochial.
It's so funny you just said that.

56:23.776 --> 56:25.695
Yeah ?

56:25.778 --> 56:28.990
Why don't you get them to
try it in black and white ?

56:29.074 --> 56:31.034
Might punch it up
a little.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.246
What ?
Did you say something ?

Were you ?

Good idea, Nick.

Good idea, Nick ?
Speak up. Quick.

- Say something before he leaves.
- Uh, Dan ?

56:50.847 --> 56:55.269

they have a stab, give me a buzz.

56:55.310 --> 56:57.438
- I will. Thanks, buddy.
- Dan ?

56:57.479 --> 57:00.983
ln case they find Nick's idea
too retro, which they might--

57:01.067 --> 57:03.611
-Oh, yeah.
-they may think it's old-fashioned--

57:03.694 --> 57:07.991
I'd be ready with some--
maybe a dot com kind of thing ?

57:08.074 --> 57:12.162
Maybe there's something about
getting on-line at the airport.

57:12.245 --> 57:14.456
No, I think we're fine, really.
Really, we're good.

Yeah. But she digs him,
and he's invited her to the prom.

- Is it ?

01:28:41.876 --> 01:28:43.795
Just a few... hours.

01:28:43.878 --> 01:28:46.798
Nick, you said that
you wouldn't hurt me.

01:28:46.839 --> 01:28:49.592
And then you slept with me, and then
you didn't call me for six days.

01:28:49.634 --> 01:28:53.388
So that, in the world of me,
that's torture.

01:28:53.472 --> 01:28:56.934
I mean, we have this totally
unbelievable, life-altering sex,

01:28:57.017 --> 01:28:58.978
and then
you just disappear.

01:28:59.019 --> 01:29:00.980
I mean, you-you-you
stopped drinking coffee !

01:29:01.063 --> 01:29:03.983
Lola, I'm so sorry.

01:29:04.066 --> 01:29:06.569
It's okay.

01:29:06.653 --> 01:29:08.780
It's okay, because
I figured out your little secret.

01:29:08.822 --> 01:29:11.449
- You did ?
- It's so obvious.

01:29:11.533 --> 01:29:13.493
How else would you know
the things that you know ?

01:29:13.535 --> 01:29:17.164
- It wasn't obvious to anybody else.
- Nick, come on.

01:29:17.247 --> 01:29:20.668
You're so sensitive.
You're so aware of my feelings.

01:29:20.751 --> 01:29:23.546
You're so tuned in.

01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:26.090
You talk to me like a woman,
you think like a woman.

01:29:26.174 --> 01:29:30.095
Nick ! Come on ! Admit it.
You're totally and completely gay.

01:29:31.304 --> 01:29:33.724
- I am ?
- You're not ?

01:29:33.807 --> 01:29:36.852
Oh ! I mean, if you're not,
you gotta tell me.

01:29:36.935 --> 01:29:39.980
Based on the other night--
Just put me out of my misery.

01:29:40.022 --> 01:29:41.983
Are you or aren't you ?

01:29:42.024 --> 01:29:44.694
Say you're gay. Then l'm not nuts.
l'm not undesirable.

01:29:44.777 --> 01:29:49.032
Not rejected by another guy !
Say it ! Say you're gay ! Admit it !

01:29:49.115 --> 01:29:50.492
Okay.

01:29:58.334 --> 01:30:00.252
I'm gay.

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.841
How gay ?

01:30:04.882 --> 01:30:08.178
Oh !
I'm as gay as it gets.

01:30:12.057 --> 01:30:14.434
You're gonna make some guy
very happy someday.

01:30:14.518 --> 01:30:17.187
Oh, from your lips.

01:30:19.064 --> 01:30:21.692
God, I hate that
I'm crying.

01:30:21.776 --> 01:30:24.987
Well, look it.

01:30:25.071 --> 01:30:27.198
If things should ever change
in that department--

01:30:27.282 --> 01:30:29.701
- You'll be the first to know.
- You promise ?

01:30:29.743 --> 01:30:33.038
Oh, yeah, I promise.
Come here.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.599
Oh, boy.

01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:57.356
-It was very nice meeting you, Nick.
-And you.

01:30:57.439 --> 01:30:59.567
Thanks for pep talk, yes ?

01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:01.610
You two just
take care of each other.

01:31:01.652 --> 01:31:03.613
- And thanks for the yarmulke.
- Oh, no problem.

01:31:03.654 --> 01:31:06.449
- You wear it well, yes ?
- Happy trails, kids.

01:31:06.532 --> 01:31:09.411
- Isn't he great ?
- Darcy !

01:31:12.122 --> 01:31:14.875
I need to talk to you.

01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:18.879
Uh-oh, look at him.
I knew it. He is weird about it.

01:31:18.963 --> 01:31:22.300
This is not about last night.
It's about the Nike meeting.

01:31:22.383 --> 01:31:24.844
And I honestly believe
in my gut...

01:31:24.927 --> 01:31:27.055
- that you should make the pitch.
- Oh, God.

01:31:27.138 --> 01:31:29.140
-I guilted you into this last night.
-No, no.

01:31:29.224 --> 01:31:31.268
- It would be better if you did it.
- No, no, no.

01:31:31.309 --> 01:31:33.478
This is your baby.
You've gotta do it.

01:31:33.562 --> 01:31:35.647
I gotta go meet and greet
these folks. I'll see you in there.

01:31:36.982 --> 01:31:39.944
- It's not my baby.
- Yes, it is.

01:31:45.158 --> 01:31:49.120
I predict no one will even know I'm
gone until the files start to build.

01:31:49.162 --> 01:31:51.498
It could be days.

01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:55.669
And then someone
will finally ask,

01:31:55.752 --> 01:31:57.796
''Where's the geek in the glasses
who carries all the files ?''

01:32:03.135 --> 01:32:06.472
Do either of you two know what
the story is on this Erin girl ?

01:32:06.514 --> 01:32:08.725
- Miss Lonely Hearts ? Who knows ?
- Yeah.

01:32:08.808 --> 01:32:11.269
Ooh, I know.
She's been here two years.

01:32:11.353 --> 01:32:13.814
She tried to be a copywriter
but got turned down.

01:32:13.855 --> 01:32:16.859
- So she got stuck as a messenger.
- What fool turned her down ?

01:32:16.942 --> 01:32:19.820
You did, sire.

01:32:19.862 --> 01:32:23.157
Well, did I ever
meet with her at least ?

01:32:23.241 --> 01:32:25.994
I don't think so. As I recall,
you told me to ''blow her off.''

01:32:26.077 --> 01:32:28.163
Well, I wanna meet
with her now.

01:32:28.204 --> 01:32:30.248
The kid's got something.
She's kind of funny.

01:32:30.332 --> 01:32:33.585
This is your lucky day. I just saw
the Nike group get off the elevator.

01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:36.422
All women. Your specialty.
Come on. I'll walk you up.

01:32:36.505 --> 01:32:38.841
I hate what I'm doing to Darcy.
I hate it !

01:32:38.924 --> 01:32:40.885
I'm gonna write her
a long letter, confess everything.

01:32:40.926 --> 01:32:42.887
- You're doing Darcy ? Since when ?
- No !

01:32:42.929 --> 01:32:44.889
I said I hate what
I'm doing to Darcy.

01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:46.891
- Men are stupider. It's true.
- Will you stop it ?

01:32:46.975 --> 01:32:49.978
- They are.
- ''They'' ? Are you a woman now ?

01:32:50.061 --> 01:32:52.731
Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have
screwed over the woman she loved.

01:32:52.814 --> 01:32:55.234
No, they don't think that way.
And another thing.

01:32:55.275 --> 01:32:57.319
- This thing about penis envy.
- Yeah.

01:32:57.403 --> 01:32:59.363
Not true. No.
They don't envy it.

01:32:59.405 --> 01:33:01.365
Half of'em
don't even like it.

01:33:01.407 --> 01:33:03.367
You know who has
penis envy ? We do.

01:33:03.409 --> 01:33:05.370
That's why we cheat
and screw up and lie,

01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:07.413
because we're all obsessed
with our own equipment.

01:33:07.455 --> 01:33:09.416
- You ready ? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:33:09.499 --> 01:33:11.418
Thanks.

01:33:13.795 --> 01:33:16.215
[Nick] You don't stand in front
of a mirror before a run...

01:33:16.256 --> 01:33:19.635
and wonder what the road
will think of your outfit.

01:33:19.718 --> 01:33:23.931
You don't have to listen to its
jokes and pretend they're funny.

01:33:25.391 --> 01:33:28.394
lt would not be easier to run
if you dressed sexier.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.439
The road doesn't notice
if you're not wearing lipstick.

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:33.900
lt does not care
how old you are.

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:35.903
You do not feel
uncomfortable...

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.905
because you make more money
than the road.

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:42.076
And you can call on the road
whenever you feel like it,

01:33:42.118 --> 01:33:44.287
whether it's been a day...

01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:46.664
or even a couple of hours
since your last date.

01:33:48.833 --> 01:33:51.586
The only thing
the road cares about...

01:33:51.628 --> 01:33:53.588
is that you pay it a visit
once in a while.

01:33:54.756 --> 01:33:57.426
Nike.
No games.

01:33:57.509 --> 01:33:59.178

Why are you not the happiest guy
in Chicago right now ?

01:34:58.492 --> 01:35:00.453
You just did so great.

01:35:00.536 --> 01:35:02.788
No, no, I didn't do so great.
We did so--

01:35:02.872 --> 01:35:06.250
No, actually,
you did so great.

01:35:06.334 --> 01:35:08.253
- You.
- You, me.

01:35:08.336 --> 01:35:10.672
We did great !

01:35:10.755 --> 01:35:14.343
Will you come with me someplace ?
I wanna show you something.

01:35:14.426 --> 01:35:16.887
- I have something I need to finish.
- Please ?

01:35:18.514 --> 01:35:19.849
Please.

Okay.
Here you go.

01:35:36.533 --> 01:35:38.494
- Come with me.
- All right.

01:35:38.535 --> 01:35:41.664
-Should I close my eyes or anything?
-No.

01:35:41.747 --> 01:35:45.793
So, you see those top

So this is my--

01:36:14.616 --> 01:36:16.618
living room.

01:36:16.702 --> 01:36:18.621
It's beautiful.

01:36:45.817 --> 01:36:47.777
What are you thinking ?

01:36:49.946 --> 01:36:52.824
You've got that look
you have sometimes.

01:36:54.284 --> 01:36:57.579
Yeah ? No. I was just wondering
when you get to move in.

01:36:57.663 --> 01:37:00.082
Well, they said
two weeks, so--

01:37:00.166 --> 01:37:03.503
Okay.
This is the dining room.

01:37:06.089 --> 01:37:08.758
- The fireplace works. Come here.
- Wow.

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.347
I can see elegant parties in here.
Waiters with caviar,

01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:16.058
- you in a beautiful gown.
- You can see all that ?

01:37:16.141 --> 01:37:19.812
Maybe you're naked and I'm the only
guest, but it'd still be elegant.

01:37:19.895 --> 01:37:22.023
Okay.
So this is upstairs.

Uh, right... here.

He'll be there. Bye. I gotta
talk to you too. That was Nike.

that we won the account.

I gotta hand it to you. You saved

01:39:40.548 --> 01:39:43.509
Actually, Dan, I had very little
to do with saving anybody's ass.

It's Darcy you should be thanking,
that's what I want to talk about.

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:49.683

The girl didn't open her mouth.

to admit when I screw up.

and I panicked.

Nick, forgive me.
I want you to step in here.

No, no, no, no. Dan, you did
the right thing when you hired her.

And I've decided...
I need to take a leave of absence.

- Hey, calm down. I can't do that.
- Why ?

01:40:51.875 --> 01:40:55.295
Because I talked to the board and I
told them I don't need her anymore.

01:40:55.379 --> 01:40:57.506
- Oh !
- They offered her a settlement.

01:40:57.548 --> 01:41:00.217

01:57:04.428 --> 01:57:06.556
Can't afford to keep it.
I don't have a job.

01:57:06.639 --> 01:57:10.143
You know, you ought to try
returning some of your phone calls.

01:57:10.226 --> 01:57:12.979
- You got your job back.
- Oh, do I ?

01:57:13.063 --> 01:57:15.566
- You're a riot. You know that ?
- lt's true.

01:57:15.649 --> 01:57:17.651
Dan told me so himself.

01:57:17.735 --> 01:57:20.946
Why would he tell you that ? I
didn't do the job he hired me to do.

01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:22.990
Even I don't blame him
for firing me.

01:57:23.032 --> 01:57:26.285
Look, I'm, uh--
You can come on in.

01:57:26.327 --> 01:57:28.329
I don't have any chairs,
but if you wanna--

01:57:28.413 --> 01:57:30.457
What if I told you that...

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:32.584
you did everything
that you were hired to do--

01:57:32.667 --> 01:57:36.922
everything-- but that
someone was sabotaging you ?

01:57:38.298 --> 01:57:42.136
Picking your brain,
swiping your ideas and--

01:57:42.178 --> 01:57:46.432
Well, you-- you never
even knew what hit you.

01:57:46.516 --> 01:57:49.894
- How is that possible ?
- Oh, trust me, it's possible.

01:57:49.978 --> 01:57:51.813
Well, who would do
such an awful thing ?

01:57:55.025 --> 01:57:57.444
I would.

01:58:00.531 --> 01:58:02.742
I was a dope
with a corner office.

01:58:02.825 --> 01:58:07.205
And when you came with the job
I was supposed to have,

01:58:07.288 --> 01:58:11.001
I mean, it didn't matter
to me that...

01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:14.421
you were better at it than me
or you earned it more than I did.

01:58:14.504 --> 01:58:19.385
As far as I was concerned, it was
mine, and I was gonna get it back.

01:58:19.426 --> 01:58:23.389
So I took advantage of you
in the worst possible way.

01:58:26.976 --> 01:58:28.895
Have you ever done that ?

01:58:28.978 --> 01:58:32.524
Taken the wrong road and--
No, of course you haven't.

01:58:32.607 --> 01:58:36.028
You wouldn't do that.
That's just--

01:58:36.069 --> 01:58:38.280
Somebody like me does that.

01:58:38.364 --> 01:58:41.075
And, uh--

01:58:41.158 --> 01:58:45.079
The problem with that was that while
I was digging the hole under you...

01:58:47.457 --> 01:58:49.542
I found out
all about you.

01:58:49.584 --> 01:58:51.545
And the more I found out...

01:58:52.671 --> 01:58:54.589
the more you dazzled me.

01:58:56.675 --> 01:59:00.888
I mean, shook my world,
changed my life, dazzled me.

01:59:02.932 --> 01:59:06.019
And guys like that ex-husband
of yours, he made you feel that...

01:59:07.186 --> 01:59:10.690
the price you pay
just for being you...

01:59:10.774 --> 01:59:12.901
is that you don't get
to have love.

01:59:12.943 --> 01:59:15.487
Isn't that what you were
trying to say the other night ?

01:59:15.571 --> 01:59:20.409
That you weren't complete ?
That you weren't really a winner ?

01:59:21.786 --> 01:59:23.746
Everything about you--

01:59:23.788 --> 01:59:27.083
how smart you are,
how good you are--

01:59:27.166 --> 01:59:30.253
everything just makes me
want you even more.

01:59:35.092 --> 01:59:37.845
Oh, wow.
Boy.

01:59:37.928 --> 01:59:40.014
So it looks like I'm here
at 1:00 in the morning...

01:59:40.097 --> 01:59:44.018
being all heroic
trying to rescue you,

01:59:44.101 --> 01:59:46.771
but the truth is...

01:59:46.813 --> 01:59:49.232
I'm the one that needs
to be rescued here.

01:59:56.657 --> 01:59:58.659
I sure wish
I could read your mind.

02:00:06.167 --> 02:00:09.796
Well, I was thinking that, um,

02:00:09.838 --> 02:00:13.967
if everything you're saying
is true,

02:00:14.009 --> 02:00:16.136
if I really have
my job back...

02:00:22.101 --> 02:00:24.020
then I think you're fired.

02:00:28.858 --> 02:00:31.945
Well, I never-- I never really
thought about it from that angle.

02:00:35.115 --> 02:00:38.994
Well, not that
I don't deserve it. I-do-do--

02:00:39.036 --> 02:00:40.996
I'm stuttering.

02:00:54.553 --> 02:00:56.680
Now I feel kind of, uh,

02:00:56.763 --> 02:00:59.516
embarrassed that I told you
I needed to be rescued.

02:01:00.726 --> 02:01:03.437
But that's-that's fine.

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:20.039
That's it ?

02:01:25.253 --> 02:01:27.422
I don't want that to be it.

02:01:27.505 --> 02:01:29.716
I don't want that
to be it at all.

02:01:29.799 --> 02:01:34.054
Then don't let a little thing like
me firing you stand in your way.

02:01:38.392 --> 02:01:41.937
I didn't know
what to react to first.

02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:44.065
Hey, news flash.

02:01:44.106 --> 02:01:46.067
I took the wrong road.

02:01:48.111 --> 02:01:50.613
What kind of knight
in shining armor would I be...

02:01:50.697 --> 02:01:53.700
if the man I love
needs rescuing...

02:01:53.784 --> 02:01:56.370
and I just let him
walk out my door ?

02:02:04.504 --> 02:02:06.464
My hero.

02:02:07.305 --> 02:02:13.159
