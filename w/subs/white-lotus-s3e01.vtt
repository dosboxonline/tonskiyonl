02:39.534 --> 02:40.743
<i>My name is Amrita.</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:43.036
- Zion.
- Zion?

02:43.037 --> 02:45.331
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Beautiful name.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.084
How do you find Thailand?

02:49.210 --> 02:51.753
Well, you know,
I just got here, but I like it.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.715
Um, I grew up in Hawaii.
It's actually...

02:54.716 --> 02:56.216
...really similar.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.759
Except there's no monkeys
in Hawaii.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.927
Yeah.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.056
It's actually crazy seeing them
up in the trees, you know?

03:04.350 --> 03:05.977
Is it your first time
meditating?

03:06.436 --> 03:09.146
No. No, no, no. My mom,
she's all into the, you know,

03:09.147 --> 03:10.315
spiritual stuff.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.399
Yeah, she just sent me here

03:12.400 --> 03:14.276
'cause she knows
I've been pretty stressed out.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.279
Just finishing finals and, um...

03:18.323 --> 03:19.699
you know, some other stuff.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.704
Okay. Shall we begin?

03:24.954 --> 03:26.372
Yeah, yeah, let's-- let's do it.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.458
Just close your eyes for me.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.589
Take a moment to settle...

03:36.883 --> 03:39.010
and focus on your breathing.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.846
Inhale...

03:44.557 --> 03:48.937
and exhale, fully release.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.152
Let us calm
our chattering monkey minds...

03:57.487 --> 03:59.906
and find in the silence

04:01.157 --> 04:02.659
what is timeless.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.662
Breathe in...

04:07.080 --> 04:11.209
slowly, and breathe out.

04:20.677 --> 04:25.682
Let the sounds
of the external world fade away.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.729
And focus only on your breath.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.821
Um, ma'am?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.364
Ma'am, that's a gun.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.117
- Huh? Uh...
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.668
- Oh, fuck.
- Okay, uh, stay calm.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.254
- Just stay calm.
- My mom's out there.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.256
- My mom's out there. No, no, no.
- Zion. No, no, no, st--

04:59.257 --> 05:00.841
- My mom's out--
- Oh my God!

05:00.842 --> 05:02.260
Oh, God!

05:46.304 --> 05:47.555
Stay down.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.165
Please let my mom be okay.
Please.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.626
Oh, Je-- Oh, Jesus,
please forgive me of my sins.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.919
I pray you protect my mom
and me.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.464
Let us get out of here.
In Jesus' name, amen.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.553
What the fuck?

06:28.179 --> 06:31.432
I said don't let anything happen
to my mother, motherfucker!

07:52.930 --> 07:55.099
<i>Oh, yeah...</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:57.393
Would you mind
taking it over there?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.729
My wife and I are bothered
by the smoke.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.615
Look, stop your smoking
on the boat.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.991
You don't have to
be a dick about it.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.410

09:38.828 --> 09:39.996
Khun Sritala.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.373
The boat should be here
any minute.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.584
I need more time.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.255
Of course, but it's almost
at the platform.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.258
Tell them to cruise the bay.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.220
- Cruise the bay?
- Yeah.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.528
Welcome to the White Lotus

10:54.654 --> 10:55.655
Thank you.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.739
- For you.
- Ooh!

10:57.740 --> 11:00.201
- I'm okay. I don't-- I don't need one.
- Take one.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.996
I'm Fabian, general manager.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.957
I'm pleased to introduce you
to one of the hotel owners,

11:07.958 --> 11:09.085
Khun Sritala.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.090
She is the visionary
behind our wellness program.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.009
I may be biased, but we are
the best in the world.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.804
Oh my God.
We are so excited to be here.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.722
Mook is your health mentor
for the week.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.766
She will answer
all your questions

11:24.767 --> 11:26.518
and can escort you to your room.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.104
- You are so pretty. Wow.
<i>- Khop khun kha.</i>

11:29.105 --> 11:30.897
- Isn't she so pretty?
- Let's just go to the room.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.901
- This way, please.
- Oh my God. You're so pretty.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.278
What's your name again? Mook?
Love that.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.655
Please stop talking.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.073
- Wow.
- Whoo!

11:40.074 --> 11:41.324
Yeah.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.243
- Hi.
- The Ratliff family, yes?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.745
- That's us.
- How was your flight?

11:45.746 --> 11:49.040
Long layover in Doha,
but it's all forgotten now.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.585
We flew over the North Pole.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.628
How did you find us, may I ask?

11:53.629 --> 11:56.423
Uh, well,
Piper here is a senior,

11:56.424 --> 11:59.509
- thank you, at Chapel Hill--
- I was also a Tar Heel.

11:59.510 --> 12:03.389
But Timothy went to Duke.
Saxon graduated Duke.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.599
Lochlan, our youngest,
just got accepted to both.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.311
So you can imagine,
it's a whole thing.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.231
And she's
a religious studies major.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.773
So she's writing her thesis on--

12:13.774 --> 12:15.942
Well, what's your
thesis on, Pipe?

12:15.943 --> 12:19.571
- Dad, don't.
- Yeah, well, it's on Buddhism,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.157
and there's a monk
at a monastery near here.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.742
Anyway, she wants
to interview him.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.577
So we made
a family road trip of it--

12:25.578 --> 12:28.955
Pam. Would you please
escort them to the villa?

12:28.956 --> 12:31.040
- Certainly.
- Please enjoy.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.585
Um... Right this way.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.670
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.047
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.258
- Hi!
- Oh my God!

12:40.259 --> 12:42.510
- Hi!
- Hi.

12:42.511 --> 12:46.181
<i>Sawatdee kha.</i> I am Sritala.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.016
I'm one of the owners.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.350
Nice to meet you.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.480
I am a fan. My husband also.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.606
- Oh.
- We watch your show.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.317
Aw. Thank you.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.027
- Are these all your friends?
- Uh... Yes,

12:59.028 --> 13:00.779
- this is Kate and Laurie...
- Hi.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.614
...and we have been friends
since forever.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.574
Yeah, we went to school together
when we were, like,

13:04.575 --> 13:05.742
- nine years old...
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.702
- ...through high school.
- Yeah.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.246
- Old friends.
- No, long-time friends. Not old.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.081
Ah, yes.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.793
You know, we have just been
so busy with our lives,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.128
and we've been
missing each other, so...

13:17.129 --> 13:19.339
You know, we just live
in different cities.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.508
And then Jaclyn heard about
this place.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.053
Everyone in LA
is talking about it.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.972
<i>Sawatdee khrap.</i> Welcome.

13:28.849 --> 13:32.644
This is Valentin.
He will be your health mentor.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.312
- A health mentor?
- Wow.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.898
- I love it.
- Okay.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.651
He is our best.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.696
Everyone requests him
because...

13:44.198 --> 13:45.241
he's handsome.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.953
I look forward
to working with you.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.706
He is from Russia.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.631
- Bye!
- Enjoy.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.301
Miss Belinda.
<i>Sawatdee khrap.</i>

14:05.302 --> 14:07.387
I'm Pornchai.
We have spoken on the phone.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.138
I'm just so happy
to finally meet you.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.142
We are honored to have you here.
And this is for you.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.229
Thank you. I'm honored.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.815
And I'm just so glad
all this worked out.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.525
And I want to learn
everything I can

14:20.526 --> 14:22.402
and bring the magic
back to Maui.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.864
That's great. Shall we?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.074
Everyone here is eager
to meet you.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.035
Oh, I can't wait.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.594
Sick.

14:50.639 --> 14:51.724
Fuck yeah.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.692
Dad. Dad,
I know I gave you shit,

15:02.693 --> 15:06.154
but this place is clutch.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.323
- I did my research.
- God, you're always right.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.824
Saxon was our hold-out.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.743
We usually stay
at the Caribbean.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.078
What? No, no, no, no.
I don't need a vacation, so...

15:14.079 --> 15:15.706
I mean, I love working.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.084
- What?
- Saxon works for his father.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.587
They love it.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.588
- It's Tim's dream.
- It's pretty great.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.174
How wonderful for you.
How wonderful for you.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.343
So, how many bedrooms are there?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.677
Uh... Three.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.930
The master
is through the common area,

15:31.931 --> 15:34.599
and then there is
one bedroom on either side.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.145
Okay. So, Lochy, you're with me.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.979
- All right.
- Uh... He can sleep with me.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.105
I don't mind.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.816
But that'd be weird.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.569
Why is it weird?

15:46.403 --> 15:48.112
Because brothers and sisters
don't sleep together

15:48.113 --> 15:50.157
after they have full grown,
you know...

15:53.410 --> 15:54.411
genitals.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.957
- Saxon. That's a bad word.
- What?

16:00.584 --> 16:03.503
Stop!
Stop! Saxon, please!

16:03.504 --> 16:05.546
Stop! Stop!
Let me go! Stop.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.967
- We're a normal family. You'll see.
- I don't know.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.343
- Seriously!
- Um... What's the-- What's the Wi-Fi?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.886
Oh, yeah.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.555
Uh... We don't actually have Wi-Fi
in the villas.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.265
- What?
- What? No Wi-Fi?

16:16.266 --> 16:20.269
Yeah. We consider the hotel
to be a digital detox area.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.231
So we actually encourage
our guests to put your phones,

16:23.232 --> 16:26.025
your laptops, your electronics,
into this bag.

16:26.026 --> 16:29.529
I will take them.
I will put them in our safe.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.365
And at the end of the week,
we will give them back to you.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.576
And that way, you can just
focus on, um, being present

16:35.577 --> 16:36.704
and each other

16:37.162 --> 16:38.371
and self-care.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.497
Yeah.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.915
This come up in your research, Dad?

16:40.916 --> 16:43.626
- No. Um...
- It's optional.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.545
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.338
I think it's a great idea.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.424
The only people I want to see
are right here anyway.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.884
- All right, honey, uh, I just--
- I'm sick of these phones.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.469
It's not realistic.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.971
We will be keeping
the phones, Pam.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.056
Okay. Uh... We just ask,

16:57.057 --> 16:59.058
don't take them out
into the common areas

16:59.059 --> 17:01.060
so as not to disturb
the other guests.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.395
Can we bring it to the gym?

17:02.396 --> 17:04.731
- Oh my God. Dude, are you dense?
- What? No.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.733
I get a way better pump
if I'm listening to music.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.943
It's a common area.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.278
He's so cute.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.487
Oh, no, I'm serious.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.614
I mean, what-- what-- what am I
supposed to do here all week

17:13.615 --> 17:14.867
without my phone?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.286
Eat a bunch of fruit?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.329
Oh, uh...

17:20.330 --> 17:22.874
Well, we do have a lot
of amazing fruit here,

17:22.875 --> 17:24.500
but I wouldn't eat that.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.503
Uh... That is the fruit
of the mighty pong-pong tree,

17:27.504 --> 17:29.547
and the seeds
of the fruit are toxic.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.632
Yeah?

17:33.010 --> 17:35.345
- Could it kill you?
- Yeah, it could, actually.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.264
It's very poisonous.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.059
Look, I wouldn't worry
about being bored, okay?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.227
Um... 'cause you're each
gonna have a busy schedule

17:43.228 --> 17:44.896
that's based on
your own personal goals.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.022
What?

17:46.023 --> 17:48.232
Tomorrow,
you'll do your biometrics test.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.611
- I don't want to take a test.
- Okay, okay.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.529
- Is it complicated?
- No, no, no. You--

17:53.530 --> 17:55.823
- We're jetlagged.
- We get a whole bunch of data,

17:55.824 --> 17:57.325
and I take those results...

17:57.326 --> 17:59.077
- Yeah.
- ...and I put together

17:59.078 --> 18:00.536
- a personalized plan...
- Yeah. No.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.955
- ...that best suits your needs.
- Okay, Pam, you seem great.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.540
You're a terrific person.
But we're tired.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.001
We've taken three flights to get here.
So let me make it easy for you.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.629
We just want to have
a good time.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.962
And me, I don't...

18:09.963 --> 18:11.714
I just--
I just want to work out.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.591
So you take care of us,
and believe me,

18:13.592 --> 18:16.345
in a week's time,
I'll take very good care of you.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.513
- All right?
- Thank you so much.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.473
I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.141
Pam's going, everyone. Say bye.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.893
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you. Welcome.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.186
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.605
- See you.
- Thanks so much, Pam.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.817
I think I'm going to take a nap.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.151
Oh, are you sure, honey?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.820
You do that
and you won't sleep tonight.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.240
- Oh, I'll sleep like a baby.
- Yeah?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.158
I'm so happy.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.577
Yeah. Come on.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.663
Let's get you settled.
Let me walk you in.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.872
Hey, Lochy,
do you wanna go--

18:44.873 --> 18:46.834
Stop! Stop.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.502
Do you want to go see the temple
with me?

18:49.503 --> 18:51.337
It's just like a mile
down the beach.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.465
- Yeah.
- No, we were gonna go to the pool.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.052
I mean, don't you wanna go
to the pool?

18:59.012 --> 19:00.096
Yeah, well, I'll come--

19:00.097 --> 19:01.764
I'll come with you to the temple,

19:01.765 --> 19:03.642
and then I'll come meet you
at the pool after.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.896
Okay. Yeah, whatever.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.940
I'll, uh... I'll see you down there.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.569
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.738
Have fun, son. See you in a bit.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.253
Yeah, we've been all over.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.131
We've been to Mexico.
We've been to Costa Rica.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.842
But we can go wherever, really,
'cause Rick barely works.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.135
I used to be a yoga teacher.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.262
Oh, wow.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.597
- Yeah, that's cool--
- But we've been traveling so much.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.473
We were gonna go back to Bali,
but then one day,

19:44.474 --> 19:46.434
he woke up, and he was like,
"We're going to Thailand."

19:46.435 --> 19:48.352
Yeah. And once he gets
an idea in his head,

19:48.353 --> 19:50.272
you can't argue with him.
Isn't that right, babe?

19:56.111 --> 19:57.821
Well, I hope you enjoy Thailand.

19:57.946 --> 20:01.283
Thank you. Oh, hi.
Great, the bags.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.242
Yeah, you can just put them

20:03.243 --> 20:04.535
- in the bedroom.
- Okay.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.079
- Yeah. Sorry they're so heavy.
- Oh, it's okay.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.540
- How are you? Thanks.
- Good. You?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.544
Uh... Question for you.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.463
You know that lady on the beach,

20:15.464 --> 20:17.132
- the owner?
- Oh, yes.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.716
Is she married?

20:18.717 --> 20:21.010
Yes, to Khun Jim, Jim Hollinger.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.930
He's a very famous man
in Thailand.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.057
Is he here?

20:25.599 --> 20:27.892
No, he's been sick.
He was in hospital here.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.729
Yesterday, he got released,
and he went back to Bangkok.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.441
- He's in Bangkok?
- This place is insane.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.235
Fuck.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.987
Fucking motherfucker.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.865
Of course he is.
I need a fucking drink.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.995
Oh, he gets migraines
when he flies.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.164
It's no big deal.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.415
If you need anything,
please let me know.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.710
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Enjoy.

21:00.801 --> 21:04.345
She's so nice!
And her name's Mook.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.390
How cute is that? Mook.

21:07.891 --> 21:11.143
Oh my God. Jesus.

21:11.144 --> 21:14.064
We're splurging.
We should always live like this.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.240
Let's check out the spa menu.

21:27.744 --> 21:32.958
Wow. All these treatments.
You should get a facial.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.712
Rick, the lady in the airport
thought you were my dad.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.131
Okay? You should get
a gentleman's facial.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.549
No.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.341
You know that's the whole reason
why people come here?

21:42.342 --> 21:43.509
This is a wellness center.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.053
That's not why I came here.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.347
Why did you come here?

21:49.182 --> 21:50.725
I wanted to go to Australia.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.644
Well, I told you
that I can't go to Australia.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.105
Why? Would you get arrested?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.650
You're like a fucking
machine gun, you know that?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.402
Enough with the questions.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.365
Oh.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.202
Stress management meditation
with Dr. Amrita.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.704
Yeah, you need this.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.497
Yeah, you need
to sort your shit out.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.000
You've got issues.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.417
I've got issues?

22:16.418 --> 22:17.836
Oh, you're the one who's crazy.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.675
Ooh! Hey, maybe we should get
fucked up tonight, you know?

22:24.176 --> 22:26.011
Last hurrah before our detox.

22:26.261 --> 22:30.057
Let's have fun! Okay?
Think about it.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.311
I love it here! Thank you!

23:11.306 --> 23:12.432
Hi.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.856
Jacs, it's perfect.
Are you kidding?

23:20.857 --> 23:22.983
- I have my own pool.
- Are you sure?

23:22.984 --> 23:25.194
- I want you to be happy.
- Hey, guys.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.029
There's like a bunch
of monkeys up in the tree.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.365
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.907
- Wow.
- Just don't feed them.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.575
Monkeys can be aggressive.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.202
- Laurie, how's your room?
- It's great.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.870
I feel like you're
kind of tucked away up there.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.915
- I'm happy to switch.
- No, I'm fine. The view is incredible.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.292
Anyway, you paid.
You should get first pick.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.461
Oh my gosh. You guys,
I'm happy with anything.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.380
Just being here with
the three of us, I'm in heaven.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.091
I would sleep in a tree.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.217
That's too generous of you.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.719
That's so nice.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.264
But we're paying
for our own treatments.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.599
And I'm going to pay for some
of your treatments, too.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.059
<i>Khop khun kha.</i>

23:57.060 --> 23:58.519
You guys!

23:58.520 --> 23:59.603
Should I open a bottle?

23:59.604 --> 24:01.440
- Heck yeah!
- Let's open a bottle.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.316
These are the moments
we gotta celebrate.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.943
A hundred percent.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.194
And we're not getting
any younger.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.529
Well...

24:08.530 --> 24:11.825
except you, Jac.
You look amazing.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.577
You look amazing.

24:14.161 --> 24:17.204
But you look incredible.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.415
You look incredible.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.127
You look the same
as you did 20 years ago.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.546
Oh, okay.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.466
You both do.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.177
Yeah, but you look like you just
got pushed out of a birth canal.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.762
Oh, God.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.764
- Who's your doctor?
- Shut up. Who's your doctor?

24:35.765 --> 24:37.266
I don't know
why you'd want to know

24:37.267 --> 24:39.393
'cause he's not as good as your doctor.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.855
I haven't done anything.
Except for, you know,

24:42.522 --> 24:43.565
a little maintenance.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.567
The basics.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.069
Me too.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.989
Thanks.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.910
To Thailand. To monkeys.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.162
To self-care.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.165
- And a week of new memories.
- Yes.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.335
Cheers.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.382
To the greatest friends
I have ever known.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.222
Seriously, you'll never know
how much I love you.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.306
I feel the exact same way.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.600
I look at you two...

25:19.351 --> 25:21.061
It's like I'm looking
in a mirror.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.549
<i>Sawatdee kha.</i>
This is for you, Khun Belinda.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.426
Oh my goodness.
Thank you so much.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.594
We are so happy
to have you here.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.012
It's been a rough
couple years,

25:57.013 --> 25:59.683
and when this program opened up,
it was a blessing.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.102
I think the universe knew
I needed something.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.854
Anyway, I just want to thank you
in advance

26:05.855 --> 26:07.649
for sharing
your knowledge with me.

26:08.191 --> 26:10.235
<i>- Khop khun kha.
- Khop khun kha.</i>

26:13.280 --> 26:16.491
It's beautiful.
It's truly beautiful.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.787
- Oh my God!
- Oh! What? What?

26:21.788 --> 26:23.205
- Oh! Don't, don't, don't.
- No, no, no.

26:23.206 --> 26:26.626
- Oh my God! What was that?
- Uh, monitor lizard.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.338
Not dangerous.
No worry, no worry. Come here.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.216
It's okay.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.639
In time, lizards will become
your friends.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.766
No. Uh-uh. No, Pornchai.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.812
This is Brahma,
the creator, a Hindu God.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.190
And that is spirit house.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.985
Thai people believe
that spirits are everywhere,

26:52.986 --> 26:57.407
so we give them offerings
for good luck and protection.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.815
I pray that your time here
brings you good memories

27:31.816 --> 27:33.151
and good results.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.696
Thank you. I pray for that, too.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.327
Okay, careful.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.621
Should we check it out?

32:00.209 --> 32:01.669
Isn't that why we came here?

32:03.671 --> 32:05.048
I'm just not ready yet.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.927
It's cool though, right?

32:11.262 --> 32:12.388
Yeah?

32:17.685 --> 32:21.689
Well, if we're not gonna go in,
I might...

32:22.482 --> 32:23.566
head back.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.026
Okay.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.570
I think I'm gonna stay
a little longer.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.155
- All right.
- Thanks for coming with me.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.450
- Yeah. Later.
- Bye.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.802
Hey. Hey!

32:51.803 --> 32:53.930
Hey, babe. Come on.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.516
You fall asleep now,
you're gonna regret it later.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.435
Did we have to go
halfway around the world?

33:00.061 --> 33:03.898
Couldn't she write her thesis
on her own religion?

33:04.399 --> 33:07.443
She could have interviewed
the Archbishop of Canterbury.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.197
We could have stayed
at Claridge's.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.878
<i>Mr. Ratliff, this is Bart Nixon
at the</i> Wall Street Journal.

33:26.879 --> 33:29.506
<i>I've been trying to reach you.
I'm on a deadline.</i>

33:29.507 --> 33:31.258
<i>If you could call me back
when you get this</i>

33:31.259 --> 33:35.637
<i>at 771-444-5801.</i>

33:35.638 --> 33:38.641
<i>It's somewhat urgent,
so I hope to hear from you soon.</i>

33:45.898 --> 33:47.149
Some guy
from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

33:47.150 --> 33:48.234
keeps calling me.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.425
Lochy! Loch!

34:13.926 --> 34:14.927
Yo.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.430
Yo, how were the monks?

34:18.514 --> 34:19.807
They were chilling.

34:22.935 --> 34:26.022
Dude, those long plane rides
make me so fucking horny.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.026
It's like a lot of hot women
away from home,

34:31.027 --> 34:33.821
no one to answer to,
acting all anonymous.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.742
It's like printing money.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.665
Cougars.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.378
Hey. Hey.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.548
We saw you guys
on the boat earlier.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.300
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.594
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

34:57.678 --> 35:00.098
I'm Saxon.
This is my little brother, Lochy.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.475
Hi.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.811
You guys should get in the pool.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.605
I mean,
the temperature's perfect.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.148
Sounds fun.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.154
Hey, you're on TV, aren't you?

35:16.155 --> 35:17.615
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:18.324 --> 35:20.368
Yeah, I-- I recognize you.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.412
Yeah, thanks.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.624
Very cool.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.752
All right. I have...

35:46.686 --> 35:47.812
Psst! Hey.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.482
How do you-- How do you get
a drink around here?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.611
You walk up to the bar,
and you order one.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.337
Hey, it's a numbers game, Loch.

36:15.464 --> 36:16.841
You gotta play the numbers.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.729
So, I'm-- I'm here
the whole three months?

36:30.730 --> 36:31.939
Yes.

36:35.484 --> 36:38.404
You know, you sure know
how to treat a burnt-out bitch.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.822
I mean, there's two beds.
That's perfect.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.157
You know,
my son's coming to visit.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.035
Oh, what a lucky young man.

36:44.410 --> 36:47.538
Uh... Tomorrow,
I'll come by at 9:00,

36:47.705 --> 36:49.289
and I'll walk you to the center.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.749
That's amazing.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.418
<i>Khop khun kha,</i> Pornchai.

36:52.752 --> 36:55.378
<i>Yin dee khrap.</i>
Have a pleasant stay.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.464
Thank you.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.354
Okay, then.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.407
You know
what this reminds me of?

38:05.408 --> 38:07.450
When we did that sketch
in school,

38:07.451 --> 38:09.661
and we were all one person.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.497
And Jaclyn, of course,
was the face.

38:12.415 --> 38:13.999
What do you mean, of course?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.459
And we hid behind you,
and I had my hands

38:16.460 --> 38:19.505
in some shoes,
and I was your feet, and...

38:20.172 --> 38:22.674
And I was the arms.
And I put lipstick on.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.259
I got it all over your face,

38:24.260 --> 38:26.094
and I brushed your teeth.
Remember?

38:26.095 --> 38:29.765
- Yes, I do. You--
- Oh my God! Right!

38:37.398 --> 38:38.441
Isn't that cool?

38:39.066 --> 38:43.154
So, when are you interviewing
this celebrated monk, Piper?

38:43.821 --> 38:46.324
I'm gonna go by the monastery tomorrow
and set it up.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.243
You mean you came
all the way here,

38:49.660 --> 38:51.454
and you haven't set it up
already?

38:53.372 --> 38:55.458
Don't worry, Dad.
He's not going anywhere.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.466
What about you, Loch?
What are your goals for the week?

39:05.259 --> 39:08.721
Don't have homework, so,
uh, probably just take it easy.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.431
Hm. I saw in the spa catalog

39:11.432 --> 39:13.975
they got a treatment
for posture.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.311
Keep your spine straight.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.937
If you're going to sit in front
of a computer your whole life,

39:17.938 --> 39:19.899
it'd be good
not to be a hunchback.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.068
Yeah?

39:22.777 --> 39:24.861
Well, I don't know.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.572
I also have a big decision
to make, too.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.493
So I'll probably spend
some time thinking about that.

39:30.910 --> 39:31.911
What decision?

39:34.121 --> 39:35.246
College.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.333
What's the decision?
You got into Duke.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.126
You're going to Duke.

39:50.596 --> 39:51.806
Tar Heel.

39:58.938 --> 39:59.939
Oops.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.358
Dad, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to have your--

40:03.359 --> 40:04.609
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

40:04.610 --> 40:06.152
No, don't take it in here.
Go outside.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.613
Hold-- Hold on a second.
Where am I meant to go?

40:08.614 --> 40:09.823
I don't know! The lobby!

40:09.824 --> 40:10.907
She said not to have it...

40:10.908 --> 40:12.868
- Out.
- ...in, like, public spaces. Come on.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.079
- All right.
- Oh my God.

40:26.465 --> 40:29.385
Ooh. I don't mean to complain,
but that's not very much.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.140
She wants you to taste it.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.893
- Oh! Oh.
- Yeah.

40:44.233 --> 40:47.236
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's delicious.
- Good.

40:51.198 --> 40:52.324
Just a bit more.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.618
What-- What is this shit?

40:55.619 --> 40:56.744
<i>Khop khun kha.</i>

40:56.745 --> 40:58.621
Gluten-free rice
and coconut balls?

40:58.622 --> 41:00.875
What are we,
at a fucking fat farm?

41:01.750 --> 41:04.170
Oh, this is so on-brand for you.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.299
To be a victim
of your own decisions.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.013
Good evening, ladies.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.597
- Hi.
- Hi!

41:15.598 --> 41:16.806
- Hello.
- Hi!

41:16.807 --> 41:18.141
How's your villa?

41:18.142 --> 41:20.852
- Oh my God. They're so beautiful.
- I saw monkeys!

41:20.853 --> 41:23.188
We gave you my favorite.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.858
A table
of such beautiful ladies.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.317
Thank you.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.195
You know, when we were little,
people would always mix us up.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.447
Couldn't tell us apart.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.533
But then Jaclyn got famous, so...

41:36.452 --> 41:38.204
Khun Sritala was an actress herself.

41:38.704 --> 41:41.456
Were you? I believe that.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.374
Many, many years ago.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.168
She's going to sing tomorrow night,

41:45.169 --> 41:46.629
so you must come here for dinner.

41:46.754 --> 41:47.921
We wouldn't miss it.

41:47.922 --> 41:50.549
I have some popular songs
in Thailand.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.386
And then, I married my husband.
He's an American.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.931
Khun Sritala is very famous
here in Thailand.

41:57.932 --> 42:01.017
Also a pioneer
in the wellness space.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.727
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:02.728 --> 42:06.065
Um... I have autoimmune disease.

42:07.066 --> 42:11.153
So I learned all about health
and wellness.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.155
I even wrote books.

42:13.447 --> 42:14.447
Uh, no, no, no.

42:14.448 --> 42:18.410
Stop, stop, stop.
No. No, no. No, no.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.294
You know what?
I-- I'm not going to eat.

42:27.670 --> 42:28.921
What's going on with you?

42:29.672 --> 42:30.798
I'm just not hungry.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.344
You know, I think the cosmos
brought us together

42:36.345 --> 42:38.556
so that we could get
to the root of your issues.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.101
No, I'm gonna help you
get your joy back.

42:42.309 --> 42:43.435
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.521
- Good luck with that.
- Goodnight.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.065
- See you tomorrow.
- Even if it kills me.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.984
Goodnight. <i>Sawatdee kha.</i>

42:50.985 --> 42:52.694
You know what?
I'm gonna go have a smoke

42:52.695 --> 42:54.113
and go back to the room.

42:54.446 --> 42:56.323
You wanna get into some tantric later?

42:58.742 --> 43:00.077
Would that make you happy?

43:47.374 --> 43:49.876
<i>Thank you for taking my call.
Do you have a minute?</i>

43:49.877 --> 43:53.004
Well, I'm in Thailand
on vacation with my family.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.381
So, you know, a minute. Sure.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.884
<i>I'm writing a piece
on Kenneth Nguyen.</i>

43:57.885 --> 44:02.013
<i>Did you work with him in 2018
to set up a fund called Sho-Kel?</i>

44:02.014 --> 44:03.182
<i>Can you confirm that?</i>

44:06.310 --> 44:09.187
Sorry. What is this article even about?
Wh...

44:09.188 --> 44:10.521
<i>We're looking into Sho-Kel</i>

44:10.522 --> 44:13.609
<i>and Mr. Nguyen's relationship
to the government of Brunei.</i>

44:14.526 --> 44:16.778
Well, I'm afraid I won't be able
to help you much there because,

44:16.779 --> 44:19.197
uh, I mean, I know Kenny moved
to Brunei,

44:19.198 --> 44:22.408
but I haven't seen or spoken
to him for, I don't know,

44:22.409 --> 44:24.745
four years at least. Um...

44:25.079 --> 44:26.287
<i>- Well--</i>
- Anyway, look, I--

44:26.288 --> 44:28.706
Like I said, uh, um,
I'm on vacation with my family,

44:28.707 --> 44:30.416
- and, uh...
<i>- I'm sorry, could you--</i>

44:30.417 --> 44:32.585
May-- Why don't you put
all your questions in an email,

44:32.586 --> 44:34.379
send it to my office,
and I'll get back to you

44:34.380 --> 44:36.882
'cause it's really--
it's really not a good time.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.842
<i>We're running the story this week.</i>

44:40.678 --> 44:42.929
Well, you know,
good luck with that.

44:42.930 --> 44:46.392
- And, uh, thanks a lot. Bye-bye.
<i>- Could you at least--</i>

45:00.531 --> 45:03.408
Kenny. It's Tim.
I was just talking to a guy

45:03.409 --> 45:07.496
from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
asking questions about Sho-Kel.

45:08.622 --> 45:09.832
You know about this?

45:11.041 --> 45:13.418
Anyway, uh, just... give me a call.

45:13.419 --> 45:15.211
I'm in Thailand, so I don't know...

45:15.212 --> 45:17.130
Whatever time it is, I'll try and pick up.

45:17.131 --> 45:20.134
But you-- But call me, Kenny.
Okay? Call me.

45:30.310 --> 45:32.104
- How's your night?
- Fuck off.

45:34.314 --> 45:35.482
Fuckin' prick.

45:41.864 --> 45:43.657
- What's up, Dad?
- Hey.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.077
- Anything I can help with?
- Uh... It's nothing.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.122
Well, if it was nothing,
then why did you take it?

45:50.748 --> 45:53.332
'Cause it was something,
and I'm gonna handle it,

45:53.333 --> 45:55.460
and then it will be nothing.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.380
Okay, y'all,
the point is to be present.

45:58.964 --> 46:02.384
- Here. Now. Okay?
- Yeah.

46:03.802 --> 46:05.053
- Thank you.
- Okay.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.141
Mom.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.478
Mom.

46:13.228 --> 46:14.271
Mom.

46:15.063 --> 46:16.482
You were asleep.

46:17.983 --> 46:18.984
Scratch my arm.

46:20.319 --> 46:21.403
Okay.

46:24.573 --> 46:25.783
Feels so good.

47:28.178 --> 47:31.431
Hi, Nat. Um... Can I get
a Mauresque please?

47:31.849 --> 47:32.975
<i>Khop khun kha.</i>

47:35.519 --> 47:36.645
I love your outfit.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.064
Thank you.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.525
I love your teeth.

47:43.402 --> 47:44.443
Thank you.

47:44.444 --> 47:46.864
- You're from England, right?
- Yeah.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.448
I used to go to London
all the time for work.

47:49.449 --> 47:51.033
- Ooh, for work?
- Yeah.

47:51.034 --> 47:55.162
- What was your work?
- No, just, you know, modeling.

47:55.163 --> 47:57.082
Oh, how glamorous.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.001
- Are you from London?
- No, I'm from Manchester.

48:00.002 --> 48:03.504
Oh, okay.
Are you here by yourself?

48:03.505 --> 48:06.090
No. My boyfriend's hiding from me.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.801
No way,
that's like my boyfriend.

48:08.343 --> 48:09.635
Your boyfriend hides from you?

48:09.636 --> 48:12.471
Yeah. I mean,
he just tells me to get lost

48:12.472 --> 48:13.765
because I get on his nerves.

48:14.474 --> 48:16.559
But honestly, he's so fucking boring,

48:16.560 --> 48:18.103
I almost don't even care.

48:21.607 --> 48:23.025
How long have you been here for?

48:23.358 --> 48:24.567
A year.

48:24.568 --> 48:26.152
You've been at this hotel for a year?

48:26.153 --> 48:28.905
No, no. We have
a house at the top of the hill.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.824
We just come down here to eat,
but we just got in a fight,

48:31.825 --> 48:33.368
so I'm letting him cool off.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.704
He's behind me, the bald guy.

48:38.206 --> 48:39.833
The one with the orange shirt.

48:40.959 --> 48:42.002
Oh.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.259
Yeah, you'll notice a lot
of bald White guys

48:50.260 --> 48:51.678
- in Thailand.
- Yeah?

48:52.554 --> 48:54.514
The locals call them LBHs.

48:56.224 --> 48:57.392
Losers back home.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.019
Oh.

49:02.439 --> 49:03.565
Thank you, Nat.

49:04.858 --> 49:06.193
My boyfriend's going bald.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.279
So much in common.

49:09.529 --> 49:10.656
We really do.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.118
What are you having? Martini?

49:16.119 --> 49:18.496
- Yes, please.
- Nat, another martini, please.

49:18.497 --> 49:19.873
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.919
- Hey, let's get pissed.
- Let's get pissed.

49:24.878 --> 49:26.088
Cheers.

49:26.588 --> 49:27.797
It's so nice to meet you.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.341
So nice to meet you.

49:31.677 --> 49:32.677
<i>I mean it.</i>

49:32.678 --> 49:34.971
<i>Everybody's so nice,
and I love the culture.</i>

49:34.972 --> 49:37.473
<i>They're always lighting candles,
and everything smells so good.</i>

49:37.474 --> 49:39.684
Oh! and I saw
two Black people tonight,

49:39.685 --> 49:41.186
and they weren't staff.

49:42.729 --> 49:45.272
<i>- That's awesome, Mom.</i>
- So, you got a final today?

49:45.273 --> 49:47.900
<i>Yeah, I have
microeconomics this morning,</i>

49:47.901 --> 49:49.319
<i>then statistics Wednesday.</i>

49:50.320 --> 49:51.445
<i>And then, I'm coming to see you.</i>

49:51.446 --> 49:54.490
I can't wait.
I don't know what I expected,

49:54.491 --> 49:56.076
but I'm starting to feel
like something good's

49:56.201 --> 49:57.451
going to come out of this.

49:57.452 --> 49:58.745
<i>You deserve it, Mom.</i>

49:59.746 --> 50:01.330
All right. I'm gonna let you go.

50:01.331 --> 50:03.500
I love you, and I miss you.

50:04.167 --> 50:05.918
And, uh,
good luck on your finals.

50:05.919 --> 50:07.587
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Bye.

50:10.841 --> 50:11.841
Oh!

50:11.842 --> 50:14.594
No, no, no, no. The fuck was that?

50:15.470 --> 50:18.390
Uh-uh. No snake falling
on my head. Uh-uh.

50:19.099 --> 50:20.684
Mm-mm. Not today.

50:28.275 --> 50:31.610
Okay, Jac,
I know that it's nice to have

50:31.611 --> 50:33.655
the red carpet rolled out
for you all the time,

50:34.322 --> 50:37.074
but is it weird to have people
constantly kissing your ass?

50:37.075 --> 50:38.535
Because I think I would go crazy.

50:39.661 --> 50:43.665
It's fine. I always have to be gracious.

50:44.291 --> 50:46.418
And I can't have a bad day
in public anymore.

50:46.752 --> 50:49.379
And I'm sure you have to wonder
about people's motives.

50:49.796 --> 50:51.506
I mean, I even get that.

50:52.215 --> 50:54.801
Everyone in Austin knows
about Dave and his company.

50:55.427 --> 50:57.928
And there's so many times
I think someone wants

50:57.929 --> 51:00.639
to be my friend
because they like me.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.184
I mean, I think I'm cool.

51:02.809 --> 51:04.311
But then I realize,

51:04.561 --> 51:06.520
pretty quickly,
they have some agenda.

51:06.521 --> 51:10.483
They, you know, want a donation
or a job for their kid,

51:10.484 --> 51:13.528
or want me to get them
on some board.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.321
I'm not complaining.

51:15.322 --> 51:17.866
I'm lucky to be in a position
to help people.

51:18.533 --> 51:20.160
- But...
- We're all lucky.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.412
- We're so lucky.
- Yeah.

51:23.955 --> 51:25.582
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.667
I am always bragging
that I know you,

51:28.668 --> 51:30.336
and people don't believe
we're friends.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.004
And I'm like, "I'm telling you,

51:32.005 --> 51:33.881
she's like one
of my closest friends."

51:33.882 --> 51:35.050
Yeah.

51:35.634 --> 51:36.760
Well, and you.

51:37.302 --> 51:40.012
Your kids are gorgeous,
your beautiful homes.

51:40.013 --> 51:41.723
You're totally winning life.

51:43.225 --> 51:45.059
Well, look at you.

51:45.060 --> 51:47.061
Now, you've found
the man of your dreams.

51:47.062 --> 51:49.271
Oh my God.
Who would have ever thought?

51:49.272 --> 51:50.565
Right?

51:54.486 --> 51:57.447
- Yeah.
- Oh, and Laurie.

51:58.865 --> 52:02.661
You just... Everything you do
is just so hard.

52:04.412 --> 52:06.413
You know, you've always been
so impressive.

52:06.414 --> 52:09.042
I mean, that corporate world
is so tough.

52:09.835 --> 52:10.961
Yeah.

52:11.336 --> 52:16.424
And your daughter seems like
she is turning into a really cool girl.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.261
Yeah?

52:19.845 --> 52:20.971
Yeah.

52:21.888 --> 52:23.181
Thanks.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.101
Dave said,

52:26.351 --> 52:28.811
"So, what? You're going
on a midlife crisis trip

52:28.812 --> 52:29.979
with your girlfriends?"

52:29.980 --> 52:34.860
And I was like, "Dave, it is not
a midlife crisis trip.

52:36.194 --> 52:37.611
It's a victory tour."

52:37.612 --> 52:39.865
Victory tour. I love that.

52:41.491 --> 52:43.201
That's it.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.912
You guys, I think the jet lag
is catching up to me.

52:47.205 --> 52:48.581
Oh! I'm gonna go to bed.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.291
Hey, I'll help you with the door.

52:50.292 --> 52:51.542
Okay, night night.

52:51.543 --> 52:54.129
- Mmm. Bye.
- Good night.

52:55.755 --> 52:56.797
Night night. Love you, too.

52:56.798 --> 52:57.965
- Love you both.
- I'll get--

52:57.966 --> 52:59.759
- I'll get the door.
- Oh, thank you.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.584
<i>Identity is a prison.</i>

54:15.961 --> 54:18.838
<i>No one is spared this prison.</i>

54:20.131 --> 54:24.552
<i>Rich man, poor man,
success or failure.</i>

54:25.804 --> 54:30.141
<i>We build the prison,
lock ourselves inside,</i>

54:30.684 --> 54:32.394
<i>then throw away the key.</i>

54:36.898 --> 54:38.858
<i>You shouldn't humor her bullshit.</i>

54:39.359 --> 54:41.486
All right? She has issues
she needs to deal with.

54:42.821 --> 54:44.114
What are her issues?

54:45.865 --> 54:48.576
Well, for one, which I'm sure
you've noticed...

54:50.287 --> 54:51.371
she's pretty hot.

54:54.165 --> 54:56.418
But I don't think
she's ever been laid before.

54:59.129 --> 55:02.632
Look, Buddhism is for people
that want to suppress in life.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.092
They're afraid.
Don't get attached.

55:05.093 --> 55:08.930
Don't have desires.
Don't even try.

55:10.015 --> 55:11.515
Just sit there
in a lotus position

55:11.516 --> 55:12.934
with a thumb up your ass.

55:15.061 --> 55:17.230
But, I mean,
it is good to want things.

55:17.856 --> 55:19.774
You know,
as long as you can get 'em.

55:20.608 --> 55:22.359
I mean,
getting what you want in life,

55:22.360 --> 55:23.737
that's happiness, bro.

55:25.905 --> 55:26.906
But...

55:29.326 --> 55:31.453
what do I want, I guess?

55:32.996 --> 55:34.164
Pussy.

55:35.040 --> 55:38.375
Money, freedom, respect.
I mean, look, you're--

55:38.376 --> 55:40.295
you're smart and good-looking,
Loch.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.713
I mean, sure, we need
to buff you up a little bit,

55:42.714 --> 55:44.299
but you've got so much ammo.

55:45.967 --> 55:49.554
You don't need to shrink away
from life like her.

55:52.474 --> 55:55.685
Get laid. Get everything.

55:57.604 --> 55:58.730
I'm gonna help you.

56:00.106 --> 56:01.566
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

56:03.985 --> 56:05.320
No problem.

56:16.122 --> 56:17.457
So,
what kind of porn do you like?

56:19.542 --> 56:20.627
What?

56:21.294 --> 56:25.256
Like hot teacher? Bukkake?

56:29.469 --> 56:31.595
Real question is,
how the fuck am I gonna jerk off

56:31.596 --> 56:33.139
with you in here all week?

56:37.727 --> 56:39.312
Eh, I'll just go to the bathroom.

57:14.514 --> 57:17.142
Timothy.
I just got a second wind.

57:18.810 --> 57:19.978
Oh, shit.

57:28.695 --> 57:30.822
Don't worry. I took a Lorazepam.

57:42.083 --> 57:44.627
That guy on the boat
was such an asshole.

57:45.753 --> 57:48.840
Saw him in front of the hotel.
Asshole again.

57:50.675 --> 57:52.635
He's probably just jealous.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.973
I mean, you have
a beautiful wife, right?

58:00.185 --> 58:01.311
Yes, I do.

58:01.978 --> 58:04.606
- The most beautiful.
- Who adores you.

58:05.815 --> 58:09.943
You have three perfect children
who worship you.

58:09.944 --> 58:12.071
You have an amazing career.

58:13.323 --> 58:14.657
And what does he have?

58:16.159 --> 58:19.704
Cirrhosis? Lung cancer?

58:20.288 --> 58:22.290
Some bimbo he met
on the internet?

58:26.085 --> 58:28.796
We have it good. No doubt.

58:31.090 --> 58:34.761
And it's all because of you.
You did it.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.682
Everyone tells me
what a great man you are.
