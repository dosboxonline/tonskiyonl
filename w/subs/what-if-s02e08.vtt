Space.

Reality.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.041
It's more than a linear path.

03:16.791 --> 03:21.416
It's a prism of endless possibility,

03:52.291 --> 03:53.666
"What if?"

04:00.250 --> 04:04.916
What you're seeing has all the makings

She is Captain Peggy Carter.

But how does
a time-displaced super-soldier

04:21.916 --> 04:25.625
end up in such
a strangely familiar reality?

04:25.708 --> 04:31.291
The sad truth is that there are worlds
among the Multiverse simply meant to die.

04:31.875 --> 04:36.250
But every once in a while,
a glimmer of hope can emerge.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.166
With their world collapsing in on itself,

04:39.250 --> 04:42.708
a band of heroes gathered together
to save their reality.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.958
The Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff,

04:45.041 --> 04:49.166
used her powers to reach
into a neighboring universe for a warrior.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.208
One willing to face impossible odds

04:51.291 --> 04:54.458

that's not her own.

04:54.583 --> 04:57.666
A hero like Captain Peggy Carter.

-Peg!

05:09.625 --> 05:13.750
But now, after weeks of trial and error,
she stands alone.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.708
A failure and an outlaw

05:15.791 --> 05:18.416
in the dying universe
she was summoned to save.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.250
On the run, with no way home.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.250
No place to go. Nothing.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.083

05:25.166 --> 05:27.666
Wait. Really? You can?

05:27.750 --> 05:29.958
Well, I mean, sometimes, yes.

05:30.041 --> 05:32.583
Do you need something? I'm kind of busy.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.583
Peggy, you don't belong here.

05:34.666 --> 05:37.375
You're fighting a battle
you can't possibly understand.

05:37.625 --> 05:40.791
Oh, really? Well, the way I figure it,
two time periods,

05:40.875 --> 05:43.875
the 1600s and the early 21st century,
have been compressed.

05:43.958 --> 05:46.041
Stuck together like two pieces of gum.

05:46.125 --> 05:49.458
Hmm, okay, you do know. Impressive.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.208
And if I don't find a way
to un-stick these time periods,

05:52.291 --> 05:53.833
this universe will shatter.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.250
Hmm.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.416
What's that for?

05:58.500 --> 06:01.166
I'm going to take you back
to your universe.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.250
I'm not leaving.

06:04.958 --> 06:06.708
Worlds die every day.

06:06.791 --> 06:09.000
I've watched millions fade from existence.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.291

she is the key to our survival,

-(HOGAN GRUNTS)
-(ROARS)

22:19.583 --> 22:21.916
Hulk smash thee!

22:22.291 --> 22:24.125
(SIGHS) Godspeed, Giant.

22:25.291 --> 22:26.333
HOGAN: You're an angry one.

22:26.541 --> 22:29.375
But not as mean as my fisticuffs!

22:29.458 --> 22:30.500
(GRUNTS)

(ROARS)

22:52.250 --> 22:53.500
(GRUNTS)

22:58.708 --> 23:02.250
Flappy and muddy fiend! Rapscallion!

23:02.333 --> 23:03.958
-(BANNER GROWLS)
-Scoundrel.

23:04.041 --> 23:07.166
Podgy tallow-faced ne'er-do-well poltroon!

23:07.250 --> 23:09.208
-(GRUNTS)
-Shut thy mouth!

23:10.416 --> 23:11.875
(ROARS)

23:11.958 --> 23:12.958
Next time, no Hulk.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.458
Whoa! I surrender.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.708
SCOTT: Hi-yah!

23:16.875 --> 23:18.000
Perfect timing.

23:18.083 --> 23:19.583
Let's get you to that scepter.

23:19.750 --> 23:21.291
(ROARS, GRUNTS)

23:21.375 --> 23:23.541
Never take your eye
off your opponent, Banner!

23:26.791 --> 23:29.625
Hear that, Bruce?
The pipes, the pipes are calling.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.541
I've had enough of your devilry.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.000
WANDA MERLIN: Yes.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.250
There they are.

23:39.666 --> 23:40.666
(GRUNTS)

23:42.958 --> 23:43.958
What?

23:44.125 --> 23:45.625
WANDA MERLIN: I'm sorry, my king.

23:45.708 --> 23:47.791
But we're out of time. Fury!

23:50.208 --> 23:51.375
Find me an opening.

23:51.458 --> 23:54.166
-(GRUNTS) Treason!
-Get the scepter to Stark!

Here we go!

23:55.500 --> 23:56.916
(GRUNTING)

24:00.458 --> 24:01.875
This had better work, Stark.

24:01.958 --> 24:02.958
Don't mind me.

24:03.041 --> 24:06.125
Just igniting an industrial
and mystical revolution.

24:06.208 --> 24:07.208
(GRUNTS)

24:07.833 --> 24:09.250
And pop goes the weasel.

24:12.208 --> 24:14.333
(SIGHS) You gotta be kidding me.

24:14.416 --> 24:17.541
-Stark!
-It's only a failure if it explodes.

The Forerunner.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.458
-Oh, Steve.
-He's the future man?

25:21.541 --> 25:22.750
That's impossible.

25:23.375 --> 25:24.500
But how?

25:24.833 --> 25:27.625
I... I remember a battle.

25:27.958 --> 25:31.958
We were fighting a monster from the skies,
armed with a golden glove.

25:32.708 --> 25:36.708
I went to strike with my shield
and hit one of the stones instead.

25:41.875 --> 25:42.875
KING THOR: It's true.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.750
Carter was right.

25:44.833 --> 25:46.208
(GRUNTS)

25:49.375 --> 25:51.833
Carter, don't be a fool. Finish your task.

25:51.916 --> 25:53.208
The one you were summoned for.

25:53.291 --> 25:55.500
-(GASPS)
-Peggy.

25:56.208 --> 25:57.375
(SIGHS)

26:00.750 --> 26:03.250
I... I can't lose you again.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.166
PEGGY: There was a superstition
back during my days in the war

26:59.250 --> 27:01.791
that victory was its own sort of curse.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.291
Because every battle you won,

27:04.375 --> 27:08.958
every inch you gained would mean
you're only getting further from home.

27:09.041 --> 27:11.291

Strange? What are you doing here?
