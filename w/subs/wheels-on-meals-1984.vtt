WEBVTT

01:38.890 --> 01:40.096
Hey, get up!

03:41.471 --> 03:42.471
Let's go.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.556
Who is it?

03:43.932 --> 03:46.173
Don't you ever come out again,
you bastard!

03:47.394 --> 03:48.579
Fighting with your wife again?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.719
I didn't come home and sleep last night.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.145
You're out of line, then.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.517
You think that was my intention?

03:53.817 --> 03:57.560
My girlfriend didn't let me leave her.
She threatened to kill herself.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.062
Her life was at stake.
How could I leave?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.763
Since you're already married,
you shouldn't have a girlfriend.

04:03.034 --> 04:06.026
We Italians are a nation of lovers.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.404
We can't get through the day
without talking about love.

04:08.457 --> 04:12.575
All you Chinese know is work.
You wouldn't understand!

04:12.961 --> 04:16.000
It's not that we don't understand.
It's just that we're selective about love.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.911
We've got to go to work.
What's your deal?

04:18.382 --> 04:20.874
If 1 go out now,
my wife will bash me to death.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.169
Then move over and let us out.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.212
If you go out, she will
bash you to death as well.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.299
We'll go down from the balcony.
You keep hiding.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.455
Aren't you afraid of the spaniard below?

04:30.479 --> 04:32.094
What's to be afraid of?
I'll go first.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.391
I'm going down first.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.411
Are you alright?

04:58.507 --> 05:00.467
Don't you Chinese kids
know how to use the stairs?

05:01.384 --> 05:03.466
The Italians are having a war
in the stairway.

05:03.929 --> 05:04.418
Hey, let's go.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.179
- Hey man, didn't you signal that the coast was clear?
- I signalled not to come down.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.327
You should have used your mouth.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.716
- I did...
- What did you say then?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.893
I said "ahh...",
but then you jumped down.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.697
Good morning. May I ask how
to get to harbour street?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.282
Harbour street, right?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.598
- How do you get to harbour street?
- Why?

05:37.629 --> 05:41.668
Harbour street, right? Go straight,
then turn and keep going straight.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.166
If you see the malaga
watercourse, then...

05:44.553 --> 05:45.633
Then what?

05:45.720 --> 05:46.720
Then you're lost.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.839
Because you've then
missed bilbao street.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.536
What should I do
when I see bilbao street?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.425
Then turn left,
and you will see a fountain.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.487
Make sure to notice
if the fountain's working.

05:55.939 --> 05:56.724
So what if it works?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.001
Then keep going straight,
and you'll see harbour street.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.795
What's the difference
if the fountain's not working?

06:00.819 --> 06:03.310
That means the city
has closed the street for repairs.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.758
Then you'll have to find
another way from the back side.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.488
Now I understand. Thank you.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.211
- Hi...
- Hi...

06:38.607 --> 06:40.188
Sorry, sorry!

06:41.568 --> 06:43.775
I really didn't mean it, officer.
I was washing the Van.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.049
He didn't do it on purpose, officer.
Let me clean it up for you.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.654
Sorry about that.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.069
We apologise, officer.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.097
You are not allowed to
wash your Van here again!

06:53.121 --> 06:55.112
Do you understand? Get lost!

06:55.332 --> 06:57.948
We won't do it again.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.216
Good morning.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.126
Good morning, did you chase
a thief through a chimney?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.262
No...

07:10.305 --> 07:12.091
Then why is your face so black?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.427
Those Chinese kids!

08:10.115 --> 08:11.980
Private detective Matt.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.284
Don't move!

08:16.079 --> 08:16.659
Boss...

08:16.788 --> 08:18.449
What the hell are you doing?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.697
Oh, I'm just exercising.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.506
Why didn't you have the light fixed?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.323
Nothing wrong with the light.
It's the power that's been cut off.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.347
When the power company receives more
than they should, they never refund it.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.207
It doesn't seem to work
the other way around.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.940
There's nobody like me. Three months
without payment, and I'm still here...

08:47.318 --> 08:48.398
What do you mean by that?

08:48.653 --> 08:49.813
If 1 didn't hire you,

08:50.113 --> 08:52.980
do you think you could get a job here,
with your qualifications?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.927
What rights would you
have for staying in Spain?

08:54.951 --> 08:58.151
Right, but without a salary, I couldn't
pay the bill for you even if I wanted to.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.115
Now that's more like it.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.740
Anybody looking for me?

09:03.835 --> 09:05.595
People from the phone company
have been here.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.710
The phone company
wouldn't hire me for any business?

09:08.131 --> 09:11.043
Right you are.
They came to take the phone away.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.505
No wonder it's so quiet here.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.420
A bald guy named Alfonso
also dropped by here.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.594
- Alone?
- Accompanied by two muscular guys.

09:20.977 --> 09:21.977
What did he want?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.475
He said you're late with the
10,000 pesetas gambling money.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.557
Right, that's a coded
message between us.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.685
That means there is
development in the case.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.732
He also asked when
you'd be back.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.860
Next time he comes, tell him
I'm out of town for another case.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.660
That's another coded message meaning...

09:41.748 --> 09:44.285
- You can tell him yourself.
- Why?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.282
He said he will back at 12 o'clock.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.377
Which is about now.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.628
What?
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.839
Why so nervous?
Is this another coded message?

09:53.093 --> 09:55.300
That's right,
it's a matter of life and death.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.912
It means my life's in danger.
I have to find a place to hide.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.301
From now on you're the
acting chairman of this agency.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.102
Whenever I'm not here,
you're in charge.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.561
That means a promotion.

10:10.652 --> 10:11.767
What about my raise?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.480
Guess there's no hope there...

10:17.867 --> 10:21.701
Acting chairman...
In other words, a real chairman.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.075
I'd better put a tie on.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.337
Please have a seat.
Before you tell me why you're here...

10:32.549 --> 10:34.915
Let me tell you my work principle.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.215
I don't take on assassination cases.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.637
And no cases that involve
stealing and cheating...

10:41.724 --> 10:43.339
Because I don't have the guts.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.550
Now, tell me how can I help you.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.958
- I want to hire you to find someone.
- Searching for someone? Haven't tried before...

10:48.982 --> 10:50.938
You haven't?

10:54.404 --> 10:56.611
Haven't tried an unsuccessful search.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.439
I didn't realise you are...

10:59.534 --> 11:02.116
Chinese, a descendant
of the dragon!

11:02.871 --> 11:04.862
Then there's no need to
waste more time.

11:04.956 --> 11:09.495
I want you to find a woman
named Gloria and her children.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.627
A boy and a girl?

11:10.753 --> 11:12.664
No, I meant only one child.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.746
A boy or a girl then?

11:14.883 --> 11:16.544
That you will have to find out.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.212
This is Gloria's information.

11:22.807 --> 11:26.891
The details are hazy, and
this picture was taken 22 years ago.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.843
It's really not that easy
to search then.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.958
If it was an easy job,
I would have done it myself.

11:30.982 --> 11:34.770
If you take this case, I still have
two conditions for you to adhere to.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.898
I got a condition too.
But tell me yours first.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.384
Firstly, you must keep a low profile
in regard to this case.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.408
Secondly, you must finish the job
and hand the persons to me within 14 days.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.985
This is the deposit.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.870
After the job's done,
you'll get 20,000 us dollars.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.948
Now tell me your conditions.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.171
My condition is that
I accept all your conditions.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.634
Great! Whenever there's any progress,
call me on this number.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.636
Want to test me?

12:24.327 --> 12:25.327
What are you doing?

12:25.495 --> 12:28.157
This way of preserving data
is better than lamination.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.284
Then I'm awaiting your good news.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.797
Let's get the business
up and running first.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.903
Hey, go and take
the orders already.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.828
- Hey Chinese guy, a glass of coke!
- Okay...

14:03.509 --> 14:05.070
- What would you like?
- Coffee, with milk.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.834
A coffee with milk
coming right away.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.338
- Anything to eat?
- No!

14:15.063 --> 14:17.679
- What would you like to eat, sir?
- One glass 22 and one box 16.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.934
Coming right away.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.663
You want something
to drink, Picasso junior?

14:22.945 --> 14:23.525
A coke.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.613
A coke.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.451
These are the orders.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.827
Okay.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.738
A "happy youth"
and a "date in the flower garden".

14:37.085 --> 14:40.623
"Thousand miles of yellow sand".
Better reduce the portion...

14:40.880 --> 14:42.280
A pair of nunchakus,
grasp it tight!

14:51.933 --> 14:53.343
This is yours.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.642
- This is yours, lady boss.
- Thank you.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.028
What the hell is going on?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.636
It's so polluted.
How can we eat here?

15:39.730 --> 15:41.846
- Let's go.
- Don't eat, let's go.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.321
How can I run my
business when it's like this?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.111
Can you go somewhere else?

15:57.540 --> 16:00.031
What's that?
Did I step on your tail?

16:00.209 --> 16:02.200
How can I run my business
when you're here?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.461
Why don't you go
somewhere else, kid?

16:09.844 --> 16:10.844
Well?

16:10.928 --> 16:13.031
Let's race one round this square
and see who's the fastest.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.636
The loser picks up the tab for today.

16:14.849 --> 16:15.178
Sure.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.548
I'll be the referee.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.674
Ready, go!

16:25.610 --> 16:28.192
Faster!

16:35.119 --> 16:36.119
Get away!

16:36.871 --> 16:38.736
Faster!

16:39.081 --> 16:40.412
We're counting on you.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.741
Where did all the customers go?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.912
With these devils around,
even the flies fly away.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.251
I'll tell them to leave.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.421
Save your breath,
I've tried that already.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.847
Pack up the stuff
and move the Van.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.141
Why?

17:00.228 --> 17:01.684
We'll play Robin hood.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.569
Faster!

17:53.489 --> 17:55.275
My mother told me
I could do anything...

17:55.533 --> 17:56.533
Besides fighting.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.419
Didn't she tell you
not to make trouble here?

17:58.744 --> 17:59.608
Yes, she did!

17:59.704 --> 18:01.786
But I forgot about that...
Now I'm going home.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.706
I won't beat you. I'm leaving.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.123
Get back to work.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.259
Good morning.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.467
Please show me your passport.

18:22.018 --> 18:22.723
It's okay.

18:22.977 --> 18:23.977
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.918
When do you think uncle chen
will be discharged from the hospital?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.837
You think it's as simple
as recovering from a flesh wound?

18:31.861 --> 18:34.477
He's mentally ill,
so it's hard to say.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.777
Damn, a flat tyre.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.779
No worry, I've got a spare tyre.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.826
I'm not worried,
I just said "damn".

18:42.913 --> 18:44.824
Then you shouldn't
have said it like that.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.326
What should I have said then?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.916
You should have said:
"Ha! Ha! A flat tyre!"

18:49.253 --> 18:51.539
You're crazy! A normal person
wouldn't say such thing.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.296
Ha! Ha! A flat tyre!

18:55.176 --> 18:56.976
You're right.
Normal people wouldn't say that.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.511
Change the tyre.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.391
Have you got a magnet?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.131
No, what do you
want a magnet for?

19:07.271 --> 19:09.102
I want to tie a string
to the magnet.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.146
Why would you want to do that?

19:11.233 --> 19:13.474
I can then lower it into the gutter.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.392
Are you okay?

19:14.487 --> 19:14.851
Yes.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.442
Then why would you lower
a magnet into the gutter?

19:18.616 --> 19:20.356
So I can retrieve the nuts.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.032
What do you need the nuts for?

19:24.747 --> 19:25.766
You mean those wheel nuts?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.405
You're quite smart...

19:28.793 --> 19:31.250
How can we retrieve them then...
Unless we have a magnet?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.085
I told you so!

19:33.464 --> 19:34.670
Guess there's no other way.

19:36.133 --> 19:40.217
I'm amazed that a pair of dimwits
can survive in this world.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.384
Look who's talking.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.723
My brain's an older one,
but it's still better than yours.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.016
So what then?

19:47.812 --> 19:52.602
Take one nut off each
of the other tyres.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.106
Then you got three nuts.

19:55.277 --> 20:00.271
Then use them to hold the tyre temporarily,
and drive slowly till you get downtown.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.197
That's right.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.741
You're so smart, pal.
Why are you here?

20:04.954 --> 20:09.163
You must be crazy.
I'm here because I'm mentally ill...

20:09.250 --> 20:11.081
Not because I'm stupid.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.331
Mental illness and stupidity
are two different issues.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.336
Do you understand,
you stupid pig?

20:18.843 --> 20:21.926
I'm not wasting my time with you guys,
or you might outsmart me.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.216
I'll go to another beach to play.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.678
Let's fix this.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.482
- What do you think he's doing?
- How do I know?

20:37.695 --> 20:39.356
- Ask him...
- Better not...

20:39.530 --> 20:40.690
No worries, let me ask.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.261
Hey pal, what are you doing?

20:44.285 --> 20:49.029
I'm a clock. I'm counting time.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.490
- So what's the time?
- It's half past two.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.339
That can't be right...
It's quarter to three now.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.502
Oops... I'm running behind.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.225
What's your dad doing?

21:11.353 --> 21:12.559
Fishing.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.642
Dad, we've come to see you.

21:20.905 --> 21:24.773
Speaking so loud...
You scare all my fish away.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.118
How are you, uncle chen.
Are you bored?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.454
The whole world's boring.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.283
Found a girlfriend for David yet?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.501
There aren't that many
Chinese girls in Spain.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.291
Spanish girls are also fine.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.964
Love transcends nationality.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.418
Your dad's personality has changed.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.465
I'm a little worried.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.846
That's so funny! Hahaha!

21:52.019 --> 21:53.975
What's he doing, uncle chen?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.470
Telling himself a joke.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.024
That's the conclusion...
Isn't that funny?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.361
Why isn't he laughing now?

22:03.656 --> 22:07.569
- He's heard that joke many times before.
- He thinks he's Columbo...

22:10.871 --> 22:14.614
Fishing, uncle chen?
Catch some for me if there are any.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.742
I'm a nut... but there's no reason
for you to be a nut as well.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.502
How can one catch a fish
from this bucket?

22:22.633 --> 22:24.153
Your father seems to be
getting better.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.599
The clock's ringing...

22:37.147 --> 22:41.265
It's time for the date.
I don't mind if you come with me.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.489
Your dad is in such a rush.
Who's he meeting?

22:49.577 --> 22:50.577
Beats me.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.542
No wonder "love transcends nationality".

23:08.012 --> 23:09.877
No wonder the doctor says
he's getting better.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.814
- Where's your mum?
- She's putting on makeup.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.014
She sent me to tell you,
so you won't be impatient.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.263
No worries, I won't be impatient
when waiting for her.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.512
Tell her not to rush her makeup.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.090
I know what you're
thinking about.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.474
I know what you guess
I'm thinking.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.343
But I'm definitely
not thinking about "that".

23:30.367 --> 23:32.095
I'm not thinking that you
are thinking about "that".

23:32.119 --> 23:35.327
I know what you are thinking about,
because I'm thinking about that myself.

23:35.539 --> 23:38.781
Since we are both thinking about it,
then we should agree on it.

23:38.876 --> 23:41.367
Right, which means we should
both forget about it.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.039
So pretty...

23:43.714 --> 23:45.295
But she belongs to my dad.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.126
Let's not then.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.050
We'll be on our way, uncle chen.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.843
We'll come and visit
you next week, dad.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.219
Don't leave yet. I haven't
introduced my friend to you yet.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.632
That's not necessary, is it?

23:57.227 --> 23:58.227
She's here.

23:59.730 --> 24:03.018
- Gloria...
- Zhong guang...

24:03.108 --> 24:04.848
You're really pretty today.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.975
Do you know how much
I've missed you?

24:07.613 --> 24:08.819
I know what you're thinking.

24:08.906 --> 24:09.906
Likewise.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.384
We're thinking about
the same thing.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.193
Make a move then.

24:12.326 --> 24:15.159
I've got to run.
Goodbye, mum and uncle.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.073
- Tell your dad we're leaving.
- Okay.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.520
- Dad, we've got to go.
- That's right, uncle chen...

24:22.544 --> 24:26.662
Don't leave.
Let me introduce you to Gloria.

24:26.757 --> 24:29.214
This is my son David,
and that is his friend...

24:29.426 --> 24:31.291
Ee et

24:31.387 --> 24:33.719
you can leave now.
Keep the world turning!

24:34.014 --> 24:35.129
Let's go.

24:38.894 --> 24:39.929
She's waiting for a cab.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.081
That means we got an opportunity.

24:41.105 --> 24:44.017
You go and tell her
that we're going downtown,

24:44.108 --> 24:46.127
and that cabs are too expensive,
so we can give her a ride.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.482
What if she likes taking cabs?

24:47.569 --> 24:49.025
Who would say such things?

24:49.279 --> 24:51.395
Why don't you go tell her?
I'll drive the Van here.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.741
You do the talking,
I'll get the Van. Go!

25:15.097 --> 25:16.428
Hey, miss...

25:17.099 --> 25:18.555
The cab's here...

25:21.562 --> 25:22.562
Bye, bye.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.775
She turned you down?

25:29.987 --> 25:31.397
No, I didn't say anything.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.070
You're hopeless.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.403
The result might have been
the same even if I talked.

25:35.659 --> 25:36.444
How could it be?

25:36.660 --> 25:39.242
You had zero chance
because you didn't talk.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.913
You would at least have
50% chance if you had.

25:44.376 --> 25:48.540
Elegant, generous and friendly.
She may be a Princess.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.712
Why would a Princess
have a crazy mother?

25:50.799 --> 25:52.279
Maybe she was victimized
by a bad guy.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.171
That's a possibility. Get in!

26:01.727 --> 26:03.934
2,000 pesetas?
Even your mother's more worth than that.

26:04.021 --> 26:07.013
Hey, don't be so rude.
Give me a better deal.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.681
How about 4,000?

26:09.526 --> 26:10.526
Okay.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.646
Thomas, two coffees, please.

26:12.738 --> 26:13.798
Let's wait until afterwards.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.562
I doubt we'll be that long.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.345
Get them to settle their accounts
when you deliver the food.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.451
How much do I
owe you guys, Thomas?

26:21.538 --> 26:23.028
Jennifer, right?

26:25.209 --> 26:26.540
1,250 pesetas.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.960
Here's 1,300.
Keep the 50 as tips.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.047
Thank you.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.913
Can I have a free spring roll?

26:33.300 --> 26:34.585
Thank you.

26:35.052 --> 26:38.169
How generous.
The spring roll actually costs 70 pesetas!

26:45.687 --> 26:46.847
Are you new here?

26:53.362 --> 26:54.522
What's your price, miss?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.062
15,000.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.240
How about 3,000?

26:57.908 --> 26:59.614
Save that for your pension.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.239
- 3,000.
- How about 2,000?

27:03.580 --> 27:04.945
Move on.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.708
Hi.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.592
Hey, I saw the Princess.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.256
You're kidding!

27:20.347 --> 27:22.200
Why would the Princess
come to a place like this?

27:22.224 --> 27:24.761
I couldn't believe it either.
Go take a look yourself.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.013
15,000 pesetas.

27:28.522 --> 27:32.765
That's s100 American,
not that expensive. Let's go.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.608
Hey, she actually went with him.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.895
Yeah, so what?
It's not like we're going with him.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.321
Why so nervous?

27:39.783 --> 27:44.026
Oh, so you two want to "go"? You've
treated me to many free meals already...

27:44.288 --> 27:48.782
Let me treat you to a
full meal tonight then...

27:49.793 --> 27:53.411
No need, we are okay. Thank you.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.266
I thought she was elegant and generous,
but turns out she's the same...

27:59.303 --> 28:01.072
It's not the same...
At least she's more expensive.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.338
She may be in need of money.
How much cash do you have?

28:04.641 --> 28:06.097
- Why?
- Give it to me.

28:06.727 --> 28:08.308
Only about 20,000.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.556
Even a one night stand
is not worth that much.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.889
No, I want to give her the money
and tell her to go home.

28:13.984 --> 28:16.145
So she'll get a night off then.
What about tomorrow?

28:16.445 --> 28:19.232
Hey bro, there are too many
ladies along this street.

28:19.323 --> 28:22.065
Every one of them is pitiful.
Can we help them all?

28:22.326 --> 28:26.160
If each one got a spring roll for free,
we would get bankrupt.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.945
Let's work.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.845
You stole my wallet?

29:01.531 --> 29:03.396
Don't run!

29:16.755 --> 29:18.620
Did you see a girl running through here?

29:18.715 --> 29:22.173
- What does she look like?
- Dressed in red. Tall, thin and with long hair.

29:24.137 --> 29:27.595
So obvious! Even a tiger has to watch
his own wallet in a place like this.

29:29.685 --> 29:30.515
What's wrong?

29:30.686 --> 29:33.039
I think I've got a fever.
Might be caused by the afternoon heat...

29:33.063 --> 29:34.063
What do you want to do?

29:34.690 --> 29:35.975
I want to go home and rest.

29:37.067 --> 29:38.827
Take this last order,
and then let's go home.

29:38.944 --> 29:42.687
Thomas, have you seen
a tall and skinny girl like this?

29:42.906 --> 29:43.946
Tall and skinny like this?

29:43.991 --> 29:44.991
Right.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.783
There are many over there.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.036
Be serious.

29:49.496 --> 29:50.531
No.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.197
- What now then?
- I'll search for you elsewhere.

29:55.252 --> 29:58.540
Didn't realise the Princess is a
pickpocket as well as a hooker.

30:00.716 --> 30:03.674
Maybe that guy lost his wallet
elsewhere and was mistaken.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.217
We shouldn't condemn
until we have the facts.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.426
We're home.

30:07.514 --> 30:08.799
You think I don't know?

30:09.099 --> 30:10.464
I wasn't talking to you.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.638
- Miss...
- Hi.

30:15.105 --> 30:18.893
You're quite something, playing tricks
on me. So much for "not feeling well".

30:18.984 --> 30:21.441
I was afraid you would be mad at me.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.518
Let's all get out of the Van.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.572
This seems to be
the end of your ride, miss.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.491
I didn't say I'd be leaving...

30:33.832 --> 30:36.164
Why don't you go
upstairs and have a seat?

30:37.544 --> 30:41.002
Are you grabbing my hand
to signal that she's not welcome?

30:41.173 --> 30:45.212
No, I grabbed the wrong hand.
Our home is just up there.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.543
Welcome to our place, miss.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.305
Thanks.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.599
Mr. star lover seems
to be home as well...

31:00.275 --> 31:02.015
Hi, have you seen fatso around?

31:02.361 --> 31:03.476
I haven't.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.000
Has someone close and dear
just passed away?

31:07.074 --> 31:08.074
No...

31:08.158 --> 31:10.615
Then why are you dressed for a funeral?

31:17.542 --> 31:18.782
Hey, long time no see.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.209
It's you, Moby!
Come and have a drink.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.211
I can't get drunk today.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.905
Have you seen fatso around?

31:28.929 --> 31:31.282
Just got here myself.
You got some important business with him?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.672
You're great. Knowing I have
important business with him...

31:34.476 --> 31:37.309
I'm now the assistant chairman
of Matt's agency.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.018
But don't tell anyone.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.291
What sort of person do you think I am?

31:40.315 --> 31:41.955
Damn you,
drink this one up as punishment!

31:50.283 --> 31:51.819
I can't get drunk today.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.658
See you later.

31:57.457 --> 32:02.076
Moby, it's been a long time.
Have a drink.

32:03.088 --> 32:03.577
Only a drink.

32:03.839 --> 32:04.839
Fine, just one drink.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.507
- Come, sit.
- I'll have another as well.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.422
Have you seen fatso?

32:11.763 --> 32:13.674
No, what do you want him for?

32:15.392 --> 32:16.677
Can I trust you guys?

32:17.477 --> 32:19.388
Haven't we known
each other for years?

32:19.646 --> 32:20.431
Then don't speak.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.893
We keep so many secrets to ourselves,
so one secret less to keep is no problem.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.896
Okay, listen up.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.186
You must not tell anybody about this.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.737
I'm now...

32:30.949 --> 32:34.487
The assistant chairman of Matt's agency.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.527
I want to talk to fatso
about something important.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.074
That calls for a celebratory drink.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.663
Thanks.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.329
Cheers!

32:44.754 --> 32:46.415
Moby's been promoted!

32:48.800 --> 32:50.040
I really can't get drunk today.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.879
See you later.
I'll go and find fatso.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.962
Congratulations
on your promotion, Moby.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.140
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

33:10.822 --> 33:13.609
Keep my little secret to yourselves.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.452
Hello.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.170
Darling, this is Moby.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.673
A little kiss? Okay.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.293
No... how can I forget you?

33:36.806 --> 33:38.842
I've been busy.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.759
I'm not lying to you.

33:44.231 --> 33:45.061
Okay, that's alright.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.560
She's probably a pig...
And still pretending...

33:48.026 --> 33:50.608
Tonight? Tonight's no good.

33:51.738 --> 33:56.732
Alright, another kiss?
Okay, a kiss... listen now.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.072
Am I speaking loud enough?

34:00.372 --> 34:01.407
Just a minute.

34:01.998 --> 34:02.998
Hey...

34:03.166 --> 34:04.451
It's your wife.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.090
Please.

34:11.841 --> 34:16.050
Bastard! Let's see if you can still fool
around after I'm finished with you!

34:18.389 --> 34:20.551
Come out now!
I'll shoot you dead!

34:20.934 --> 34:23.219
Susanna, calm down.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.139
That bastard's got lipstick
on his underpants.

34:26.356 --> 34:27.219
I'm innocent.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.728
Take a closer look.
These are ladies' panties, not mine.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.400
Why are you wearing them?

34:32.529 --> 34:34.735
I put them on by mistake.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.570
I'll shoot him dead!
Shoot him dead!

34:38.076 --> 34:39.407
This is our door!

34:39.619 --> 34:40.529
Don't stand in my way!

34:40.620 --> 34:42.806
Point the rifle at your door,
and we won't stand in your way!

34:42.831 --> 34:43.831
Let go!

34:45.542 --> 34:47.328
Why are you holding onto me?

34:47.418 --> 34:49.659
Listen, you're upset because
you don't want to lose him.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.399
If you kill him,
then you won't have anything left.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.665
He might have had a one night stand,
but ultimately he'll be by your side.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.592
If you really killed him, you'd
never find another one like him.

34:57.721 --> 35:00.258
Yes, I love him!

35:00.390 --> 35:01.596
Go get your husband back.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.557
Dino, dino!

35:07.606 --> 35:09.517
Why don't you answer me?

35:09.899 --> 35:13.232
Don't you know how much I love you?

35:13.320 --> 35:14.435
I do too...

35:14.571 --> 35:17.438
Do you remember the first time we met
at the leaning tower of pisa?

35:17.616 --> 35:19.277
Love at first sight...

35:19.743 --> 35:20.277
Really?

35:20.410 --> 35:22.366
You're my whole life.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.570
Without you,
I have nothing left.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.787
Dino, dino...

35:27.959 --> 35:29.119
You bastard!

35:30.003 --> 35:33.621
I'll kill you!
Nowhere for you to run! Bastard!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.031
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have barged in.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.260
Oh, a short visit is no problem.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.220
I'm not planning on
leaving tonight.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.305
What?

35:44.643 --> 35:45.643
You have any objections?

35:46.144 --> 35:49.102
No, as long as she's not afraid.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.725
Why should I be
afraid of you guys?

35:51.024 --> 35:52.024
Right...

35:55.487 --> 35:57.068
What could she be afraid of?

36:00.492 --> 36:02.357
Afraid of you sleepwalking.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.333
Fatso?

36:11.628 --> 36:12.868
Fatso. What happened?

36:12.962 --> 36:14.418
Were you robbed?

36:14.881 --> 36:16.746
Luckily I came too late...

36:19.302 --> 36:20.417
I can't move you...

36:22.138 --> 36:23.469
What happened?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.299
Alright, no need to tell.
It's none of my business anyway.

36:27.477 --> 36:30.059
I need some information from you.
Be honest to me.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.266
18 years ago, when you were
Mr. pimp on flower street.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.556
Did you know anyone
by the name Gloria?

36:34.734 --> 36:38.727
She might have been pregnant
or just had a baby then.

36:41.199 --> 36:41.779
What?

36:41.908 --> 36:44.775
The ones that beat you up...
Were they also asking for Gloria?

36:45.161 --> 36:46.161
Did you tell them?

36:46.621 --> 36:47.621
Not...

36:48.206 --> 36:48.945
That's better.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.247
Not telling them... would
mean I'm dead already.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.833
It means you know
where Gloria is.

36:53.962 --> 36:58.547
No... I do now... in the past...

36:59.008 --> 37:01.499
Hey pal, stop stammering
so much when you're talking.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.631
Where did Gloria live?

37:04.514 --> 37:09.008
62 Thanksgiving street.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.312
Aren't you afraid she might do this...â

37:15.942 --> 37:17.307
We can hide our money.

37:18.027 --> 37:21.269
If she really did try to steal
and couldn't find the money anywhere,

37:21.364 --> 37:24.822
then she'll know we've taken precautions.
That might hurt her self-esteem.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.611
You're right.

37:28.705 --> 37:31.545
Let's remove most of the money
from our wallets and just leave a little.

37:31.624 --> 37:36.243
Even if she did steal it, it's a low price to pay.
We get to know her real face, and that's worth it.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.593
Four-eyes, you're really thinking smart.

38:04.824 --> 38:05.688
You gave her your shirt?

38:05.784 --> 38:06.648
Yes.

38:06.743 --> 38:07.949
It looks better on her.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.237
Are you talking about me?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.114
Pretty...

38:12.081 --> 38:13.681
Didn't sound like you just
said one word.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.537
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

38:17.086 --> 38:19.543
Where am I going to sleep?
Have you decided yet?

38:19.672 --> 38:20.582
You'll sleep in...

38:20.673 --> 38:21.458
In the living room.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.048
Okay, thanks. My name's Sylvia.

38:24.135 --> 38:24.999
I'm David.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.254
I'm Thomas.

38:33.186 --> 38:33.720
Good night.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.139
I don't want to sleep yet.
Why don't you two go first?

38:36.231 --> 38:37.391
I want to watch TV.

38:37.524 --> 38:38.309
Let me turn it on for you.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.139
Thank you.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.533
I'm going to bed.

39:17.647 --> 39:20.087
The cushion can give you neck pain,
so I brought you a pillow.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.025
Thank you.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.366
Can I get you a glass of water?

39:32.495 --> 39:33.495
Okay.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.620
It's cold in the night.
Better to have a blanket.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.711
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.012
Water is no good.
I'll get you a cup of milk.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.801
Sounds good.

40:10.491 --> 40:11.947
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.923
Let's not waste time.

40:33.014 --> 40:36.177
Let's make it clear.
Who wants to sleep with me first?

40:36.392 --> 40:37.552
It makes no difference to me.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.106
Do a solo!

40:51.324 --> 40:52.689
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.553
Did everything go well last night?

40:54.577 --> 40:56.192
Yes, why wouldn't it?

40:56.454 --> 40:57.489
That's good.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.041
Have you seen my car?

41:04.295 --> 41:05.295
No.

41:07.757 --> 41:10.669
Hey, wifey!
My car has been stolen!

41:12.470 --> 41:16.713
Wifey! My car has been stolen!
I'm going to report it to the cops!

41:21.062 --> 41:22.893
Has the Princess left already?

41:27.944 --> 41:30.185
Don't judge people
by their appearance.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.487
Harmful acts should be discouraged,
but prudence is a virtue.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.694
Have some faith in mankind.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.162
My money's gone.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.661
See, it's a typical experience.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.422
I knew that girl would
steal our money.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.876
Hiding your money in the drawer
is like leaving it in an unlocked atm.

41:54.971 --> 41:57.678
I was smart, I put mine in one of my shoes.

41:57.765 --> 41:59.426
Takes more time to go through.

42:04.313 --> 42:05.769
Damn, my money is gone too.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.013
That seems more fair.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.937
I told you not to let
her stay over night.

42:10.236 --> 42:11.796
That's the first time
I hear you say it.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.050
She's really something!
Managed to grab all our money!

42:15.074 --> 42:17.611
Don't accuse her like that.
She didn't grab it all, did she?

42:18.578 --> 42:19.909
I sure hope I run into her.

42:20.663 --> 42:21.663
Likewise.

42:21.748 --> 42:23.158
What would you do?

42:23.249 --> 42:24.534
Ask her if she needs more.

42:37.513 --> 42:40.050
Are you kidding me?
Do you know how to drive?

42:40.349 --> 42:41.179
Do you have a licence?

42:41.309 --> 42:43.641
I'm sorry, sir. It's my fault.
I'll pay for the damages.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.807
That goes without saying.

42:47.231 --> 42:50.098
Look at this. Even if I fixed it,
it wouldn't regain its beauty.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.980
Please forgive me, sir.
Don't get upset.

42:53.362 --> 42:55.523
Luckily you bumped onto
a reasonable guy like me.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.779
But the way you drive
is quite dangerous.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.195
My brother always
tells me not to drive a car.

43:00.453 --> 43:03.786
He says I'm like in an unconscious mode.
And here I am crashing again.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.374
Dino Martini is my brother.
It's his car.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.702
You call him up.
He'll get your car fixed.

43:10.922 --> 43:11.922
But...

43:12.632 --> 43:14.432
I'm late for work.
I'll get fired if I'm late.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.752
Call me when you're available,
and we'll have some tea.

43:16.803 --> 43:17.803
Okay, okay...

43:17.845 --> 43:18.845
Thanks.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.718
Back up, back up...

43:25.186 --> 43:26.186
Go, go...

43:29.107 --> 43:30.107
Bye, bye.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.458
Who's that?

43:58.719 --> 43:59.629
What do you want?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.802
We're going for a ride.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.007
To the police station?

44:09.981 --> 44:11.937
You're not cops.
And I don't know you.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.476
Where do you want to take me?

44:13.609 --> 44:16.817
- Somewhere nice. Do as you're told.
- And if I don't?

44:19.031 --> 44:21.238
If you don't, then we
will be very rude.

44:24.287 --> 44:25.777
Let me go! Let me go!

45:09.999 --> 45:12.285
Let's go!
Chasing the girl is more important!

45:21.469 --> 45:22.925
Let's split up.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.214
That's right, it's them.

45:28.726 --> 45:32.139
You're not bad. When will you be
able to deliver them to me?

45:32.521 --> 45:36.355
Wait, I've got a question to ask you.
Don't you trust me?

45:36.776 --> 45:39.313
You hire me first,
then hire another gang to find the girl.

45:40.571 --> 45:41.686
Who are those people?

45:42.073 --> 45:43.859
I should be the one
asking that question.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.858
They were quite nasty too.

45:47.536 --> 45:49.151
I didn't hire another gang.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.069
Then why...

45:50.164 --> 45:51.700
Stay out of that.

45:51.916 --> 45:55.408
Just don't let anybody
else capture Sylvia.

45:55.711 --> 45:58.077
Staying out of that issue?
If you don't tell me,

45:58.256 --> 45:59.837
I might end up dead
without knowing why.

45:59.966 --> 46:01.246
I won't continue with this case.

46:01.842 --> 46:02.842
Wait a minute!

46:05.763 --> 46:08.470
I'm sorry for all your suffering.

46:08.933 --> 46:10.924
But I can't be of much help.

46:11.394 --> 46:14.056
I can only increase your fee.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.809
How much time do you need
to think it over?

46:23.447 --> 46:25.108
I need three seconds
to think it over.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.402
One, two, three. I'll carry on.

46:28.744 --> 46:31.156
That's good. May god bless you.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.289
Thanks.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.926
Why would Moby want
to invite us out clubbing?

46:55.146 --> 46:56.807
He must be wanting a favour from us.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.897
We'd better say no to whatever he asks.

47:08.701 --> 47:09.986
Have a seat.

47:10.119 --> 47:11.325
Can't say no to that.

47:11.537 --> 47:12.743
True.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.031
What would you like to drink?

47:17.126 --> 47:18.832
Three glasses of beer,
one bottle of xo.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.912
How's the fast-food
business lately?

47:23.466 --> 47:25.457
Not good. It's worse than
being a waiter before.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.960
Was my tip on the re-designing job of
your fast-food Van any good?

47:29.055 --> 47:30.795
No, it's worse than before.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.910
Has your father got
any better from his illness?

47:33.934 --> 47:35.970
No, his condition is
worse than before.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.957
Huh, when he got committed,
he was already chopping people...

47:38.981 --> 47:41.472
Don't listen to him.
He's much better now.

47:42.234 --> 47:43.770
That's good. Here's the beers.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.937
Cheers to your father
for recovering soon.

47:48.991 --> 47:49.991
We don't like this.

47:50.326 --> 47:52.612
You don't have right to
say no to that. Cheers!

47:54.205 --> 47:55.205
Our trick's not working.

47:55.706 --> 47:57.466
There's still the
"mismatched answers" trick.

48:02.296 --> 48:04.287
I need a favour from you guys.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.190
I crashed into a girl's
car this morning.

48:06.801 --> 48:10.339
No wonder the dog downstairs
gave birth to four puppies!

48:11.722 --> 48:14.839
What does that have
to do with my accident?

48:15.434 --> 48:18.096
So what does your accident
have anything to do with us?

48:22.149 --> 48:23.264
Just let me finish first.

48:23.609 --> 48:26.271
After I bumped into her car,
she gave me a card.

48:26.612 --> 48:28.212
She said the car
belonged to her brother.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.133
It still doesn't have
anything to do with us.

48:30.157 --> 48:33.445
When I contacted the guy,
he said he had no sister.

48:33.702 --> 48:36.114
And he claimed his car
was recently stolen.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.225
When I described to him
how the girl looked like,

48:38.249 --> 48:40.530
he said it sounded like
a girl you brought home yesterday.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.958
Even so, it's still
none of our business.

48:43.170 --> 48:44.170
That's right.

48:45.548 --> 48:49.291
The girl gave me some money,
and asked me to give it to you.

48:50.219 --> 48:51.819
She's actually returning
the money to us.

48:52.012 --> 48:55.129
Not returning...
She asked me to give you it.

48:55.683 --> 48:57.969
Giving?
She stole that money from us last night.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.389
So you were her victims too.

49:00.688 --> 49:01.808
Still none of your business?

49:03.315 --> 49:05.101
Whatever!
Just give us the money.

49:05.734 --> 49:10.444
Hey, that's not it.
She still hasn't given me your money.

49:10.823 --> 49:12.233
I better go bust a move.

49:13.409 --> 49:14.990
Me too.

49:29.341 --> 49:31.878
Can you tell me where
she usually hangs around?

49:32.011 --> 49:33.011
The door to her home.

49:33.137 --> 49:36.550
Can you tell me what place
she goes to every day then?

49:36.640 --> 49:37.220
Yes... the ladies' room.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.014
Stop joking,
and tell me the truth.

49:39.101 --> 49:40.136
The truth?

49:40.269 --> 49:41.554
The truth is that we don't know.

49:43.856 --> 49:46.142
Okay then,
pretend I never asked.

49:46.358 --> 49:49.942
- Hey... don't be like that, okay?
- You just told us to pretend you didn't ask.

49:50.112 --> 49:52.854
Oh yes, I did ask...
Don't be such jerks, please.

49:52.948 --> 49:54.984
And we did answer you.
We really don't know.

49:55.117 --> 49:58.029
Okay, this time I really mean it.
Pretend I never asked.

50:13.427 --> 50:16.385
Some friends you are!
Refusing to help your own people!

50:16.972 --> 50:20.760
We are all Chinese people.
Just some answers, and you refuse to help!

50:20.851 --> 50:23.888
God knows what happens
if you had to be blood donors!

50:25.064 --> 50:28.022
I can even hear myself.
How can you not hear me?

50:28.150 --> 50:29.310
What?

50:29.485 --> 50:32.147
Even the worst spaniards
are better than you!

50:32.738 --> 50:34.228
What are you saying?

50:34.323 --> 50:36.530
The speakers are too loud!
Can't hear you! Speak louder!

50:37.284 --> 50:38.364
I said,

50:38.452 --> 50:41.569
even the worst spaniards are...

50:45.376 --> 50:47.207
Sorry, I'm out of line.

50:48.003 --> 50:50.585
Great, guys!
Embarrassing me again...

50:56.053 --> 50:57.668
Who do you think Sylvia really is?

50:57.763 --> 50:58.763
A spaniard.

50:59.014 --> 51:01.551
Bullshit!
I mean, why is she so wanted?

51:02.142 --> 51:03.757
Because she's gorgeous.

51:04.103 --> 51:04.967
Idiot!

51:05.062 --> 51:07.269
She's not an idiot.
She's quite bright.

51:07.356 --> 51:08.937
I meant you!

51:14.697 --> 51:16.233
- Sylvia.
- David.

51:16.448 --> 51:17.984
Long time no see. How are you?

51:18.075 --> 51:20.316
Long time?
It's been less than 24 hours.

51:21.412 --> 51:23.403
They're forcing me
against my will.

51:24.540 --> 51:26.451
Hey pal, mind your manners to a lady.

51:37.678 --> 51:40.511
Kicking? Kicking me?

51:47.896 --> 51:48.896
What's up?

51:49.023 --> 51:50.023
Ask them.

51:50.232 --> 51:51.972
A girl stole my wallet.

51:52.067 --> 51:54.058
These two are her accomplices.

52:01.285 --> 52:02.695
Don't run!

52:16.258 --> 52:19.546
Fooled by that girl again.
Don't trust anything she says from now on.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.593
You better tell that to yourself.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.045
I've never trusted her anyway.

52:23.974 --> 52:26.260
Look at what she's gotten us into.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.721
Easy now!

52:28.812 --> 52:30.222
- It's you.
- It's you.

52:30.439 --> 52:31.895
I came to thank you.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.606
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be arrested already.

52:34.860 --> 52:38.193
No need to thank us.
If we knew why they were after you,

52:38.447 --> 52:40.153
we wouldn't have helped you.

52:42.743 --> 52:44.028
Tell her not to go yet.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.450
Weren't you saying...

52:45.621 --> 52:46.621
Call her back.

52:46.830 --> 52:47.945
Wait a minute.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.447
We want to ask you something.

52:51.627 --> 52:53.913
Do you mind coming up
and have a chat?

52:54.213 --> 52:55.813
I was more afraid
you wouldn't ask me to.

52:58.133 --> 52:59.714
Didn't you have
something to ask her?

52:59.927 --> 53:02.088
I think you should
ask her instead.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.636
- Me?
- Gol

53:06.600 --> 53:08.431
I want...

53:09.603 --> 53:11.218
I want to ask...

53:11.313 --> 53:12.428
What you want to drink?

53:12.523 --> 53:13.603
Red wine.

53:14.149 --> 53:15.730
Okay, leave it to me.

53:15.818 --> 53:17.399
Get straight to the point.

53:21.573 --> 53:24.406
It's like this...
You slept here last night.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.904
But this morning we
noticed that...

53:27.788 --> 53:29.494
Noticed that...

53:30.207 --> 53:33.199
The clothes were still here.
And the blanket was folded nicely.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.496
Money... gone.

53:39.675 --> 53:41.256
And gone were...

53:41.593 --> 53:43.549
And gone were you.

53:43.971 --> 53:47.589
- So then we knew you were gone.
- Okay, you take a rest. No need for you to ask.

53:49.017 --> 53:52.180
David wanted to ask whether you
have stolen our money during the night?

53:52.271 --> 53:53.602
Yes.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.875
And you stole from those
men who chased you as well?

53:55.899 --> 53:56.934
Yes.

53:57.025 --> 53:58.765
Don't speak so rudely.

53:58.861 --> 54:01.273
Speaking rudely? Then you ask.

54:03.240 --> 54:09.987
There's no need for you to do that. With your
qualifications, you could honestly do...

54:13.709 --> 54:16.701
What he meant to say is,
with your qualifications

54:16.795 --> 54:20.333
you could honestly do a
lot better being a hooker.

54:22.885 --> 54:25.251
I hate it the most when
people call me a hooker.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.506
I earn a living with my brain,
not by selling my body.

54:27.598 --> 54:29.634
Nobody can get me to bed
by offering me money.

54:29.725 --> 54:33.263
He's the one asking.
I'm just the interpreter, miss.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.514
I really didn't deserve this slap.

54:35.814 --> 54:38.556
But... stealing is still wrong.

54:40.694 --> 54:45.438
When I was 14 years old, my mum
was committed to the mental hospital.

54:46.992 --> 54:51.452
From that moment,
I had to support myself.

54:52.498 --> 54:54.489
Nobody would give
me any opportunity.

54:56.543 --> 55:01.628
All the men I met...
No matter how things turned out,

55:03.342 --> 55:05.674
they all ended up wanting
to take advantage of me.

55:05.761 --> 55:09.345
You're probably right.
That's what he wanted at first, too.

55:10.265 --> 55:11.801
Regarding these men,

55:12.351 --> 55:17.186
I take it as giving them a lesson
by stealing their money.

55:17.898 --> 55:21.140
Don't forget this lesson
next time you see pretty girls.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.476
I already told you not
to get involved.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.652
I'm not talking about you guys.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.446
After tonight's happening,

55:30.994 --> 55:32.825
I know you have good intentions.

55:32.913 --> 55:35.120
I will give you back
the money as fast as I can.

55:35.207 --> 55:37.368
Oh, I was just after
an explanation.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.620
Pay him first when
you've got the money.

55:39.711 --> 55:43.169
I'm not like him. He needs the money
to go back to Hong Kong to get married.

55:43.257 --> 55:45.339
That's not true.
I was saving it for an emergency.

55:45.676 --> 55:48.839
Oh, so it's spare money.
You'd better pay me first then.

55:49.346 --> 55:50.506
Whatever.

55:50.681 --> 55:52.592
Just make sure the money's legal.

55:52.683 --> 55:54.423
Thomas also mentioned to me...

55:54.518 --> 55:56.554
Your mum and my dad
are close friends.

55:56.645 --> 55:58.510
How could we let you
go down the dark path?

55:58.689 --> 55:59.804
Don't you agree?

55:59.898 --> 56:00.728
Right.

56:00.816 --> 56:03.056
But he's afraid that you
can't turn from your bad habits.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.559
If there was another option...

56:05.654 --> 56:07.374
Nobody would choose
a destructive lifestyle.

56:07.406 --> 56:09.567
So what if you really
got another choice?

56:09.658 --> 56:11.398
I would start all over again.

56:11.869 --> 56:12.733
That's great.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.784
Four-eyes, didn't you
say we're understaffed?

56:14.913 --> 56:16.699
No, I didn't.

56:17.833 --> 56:19.698
Oh yes, but...

56:20.127 --> 56:21.867
He's afraid you won't last.

56:22.170 --> 56:24.786
If you don't give me a chance,
how could you know that?

56:25.215 --> 56:29.333
Okay, you'll get a 3 month trial,
then a raise after that.

56:56.580 --> 57:00.072
The pedestrians on the road
are walking at a slow pace

57:00.167 --> 57:02.874
yet I'm rushing with
all my strength

57:08.258 --> 57:10.840
How would I have time
to be depressed

57:12.262 --> 57:15.675
even if I accidentally
fall on the road,

57:16.058 --> 57:18.925
I believe I have the strength
to stand back up

57:19.811 --> 57:23.554
although it's a hard life,

57:23.815 --> 57:26.522
I'll still be having a fresh smile

57:26.777 --> 57:28.608
it's all about belief

57:28.695 --> 57:31.107
no point in dreaming,
keep walking with strength

57:31.448 --> 57:34.565
I'm getting closer to my dream

57:34.785 --> 57:39.154
with faith I'm free
to pursue my dream

57:39.539 --> 57:42.747
with you leading me,
I'll grow in confidence

57:47.047 --> 57:50.710
I'm looking for myself
and replanting my roots

57:51.134 --> 57:57.004
and with happiness, even if it
slipped away, I can still stand back up

58:30.298 --> 58:31.959
I need to talk to you.

58:34.302 --> 58:35.382
Come with me.

58:38.473 --> 58:40.589
What are you doing?

58:41.059 --> 58:43.425
- What do you want?
- Can you listen to me?

58:43.687 --> 58:45.552
I'm not after my wallet.

58:45.981 --> 58:48.438
I want to take you
to meet a person.

58:48.525 --> 58:51.312
You'll benefit tremendously
from meeting this person.

58:51.403 --> 58:52.403
Would you come?

58:53.780 --> 58:54.815
Help!

58:55.574 --> 58:56.734
Why are you calling for help?

58:56.825 --> 58:58.190
I mean no harm at all.

58:58.326 --> 58:59.816
I'm a private detective.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.987
Just come with me and meet
this person, that's it.

59:03.081 --> 59:05.697
Take it as doing a favour
for me, okay? Trust me.

59:05.792 --> 59:08.204
If you come with me
and stop screaming,

59:08.295 --> 59:09.705
I'll let you go, okay?

59:18.055 --> 59:19.699
I've been deceiving
people since I was a kid.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.284
You really think your shitty
tricks can deceive me?

59:21.308 --> 59:22.844
Don't waste your time.

59:48.376 --> 59:49.115
Where is it?

59:49.211 --> 59:50.211
Over there.

59:51.338 --> 59:52.043
Miss.

59:52.130 --> 59:54.041
Don't come near me,
or I'll throw it at you.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.177
Thank you.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.129
Don't say I didn't
warn you guys.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.632
Sylvia's in great danger.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.934
If you don't trust me,
you'll regret it.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:10.891
Let me borrow this.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.062
- Where?
- Over there.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.812
- What should we do now?
- Pack for the day.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740
Don't move!

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:32.211
Let me go!

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.087
Let me go!

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:45.182
Let her go!

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:46.392
Don't come near.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:57.611
Come on.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:13.871
Get in.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:23.088
After them!

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.633
Why are you taking my car?
Stop...

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.266
Drive faster.
They're closing in.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:43.616
I can't stand this.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:44.658
Let her sit here then.

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.069
You wish! You sit back there!

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:47.578
Go!

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:58.044
Back off! Hurry, back off!

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.729
Are you out of your mind?
Driving like that?

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:26.277
Good thing I have a racing car,
otherwise I'd have been dead.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.859
Be careful next time. Slow down.

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.049
It's a dead end!

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.092
Up the ramp.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:44.799
Hang on!

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.234
You're great.
They aren't behind us anymore.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.406
I know that.
But now they're in front of us.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.788
Let's see if you have
guts to hit me.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:13.676
Move over.
Time to taste my latest weapons.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.600
Ready, aim, fire.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.266
I'll have some fun too.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:24.687
I'll let you taste some oil.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.111
Have a taste of this gas bottle.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.873
In addition to your gadget,
I'll add my ramp.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:14.361
How is the situation?

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.485
The enemies are wiped out.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.339
So many men,
and still you fail to grab the girl.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:38.052
The only explanation
is that you are useless.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:48.318
Morons!

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.606
What else can you
do besides eating?

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.990
You wasted six days for nothing.
Now we only have eight days left.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:58.235
God created the world in six days.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.203
Eight days should be more
than enough to grab a girl.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:08.041
Whether I'm able to inherit
the count's legacy after eight days,

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.913
it will all depend on your effort.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.255
- What do you...
- Who are those...

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:21.592
You first.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.136
Who are those people?

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:26.642
Your turn.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:27.816
You already said it.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.879
It's not the first time
they tried to kidnap me.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:30.938
That's true.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:34.441
Moby?

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.490
You should have said something!
If I had a gun, you'd be dead already.

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.024
And I wouldn't
know how to dodge?

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:43.913
Those guys will keep
coming after Sylvia.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:45.311
They'll continue
until they get her.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:46.415
Who are they really?

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:47.788
Bad guys.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.119
How do you know that?

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.797
- Because I'm the good guy.
- Tell me the whole story.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:56.168
The story is simple,
but the situation is complicated.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.878
There are two gangs involved.
The first gang are those guys.

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:01.589
The other gang consists
of only one person, which is me.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.300
I'm officially looking for Sylvia.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:07.095
Those guys would do
anything to kidnap her.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.757
My reason for finding Sylvia,
is to deliver her to my client.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.147
I don't know why they
want to kidnap her though.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.944
Wow, hearing you speak
makes my ears itch.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.312
Your explanation makes no sense.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:21.238
But you should know
why your client wants me.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:22.865
Yes, I should.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.414
But since my client didn't
want to tell me the reason,

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.075
I really don't know
what I should have known.

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:33.504
Moby, the great detective.
Can you tell me something you do know?

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.276
There are at least
two things I know of.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.250
Firstly, this place is dangerous.

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:39.631
Is there a gas leak here?

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:42.008
No... if you don't trust me,
there's nothing I can do.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:46.351
Secondly, if Sylvia wants to know
why I came for her,

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:48.207
she better come with me
to meet my client.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:50.267
There's one thing
I know as well.

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:50.972
What?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:54.935
The world's most clueless
detective is present in my house.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:58.109
You don't need to believe me,
but don't insult me.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.114
It's not that we
don't believe you.

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:02.734
But how long have you actually
been a private detective?

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.281
Six days.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:07.489
So you've not even received
your first paycheque.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:11.418
If we believed you, it would
be an insult to our intelligence.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:15.247
- Hey...
- Enough, no need to say more.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.712
You didn't just insult me,
but you broke my heart as well.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.979
Moby, keep blocking them.
Let's go.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.563
- We'll leave from the balcony.
- Moby, we're leaving!

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:36.755
Even a tiger can't stop me.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.189
Four-eyes, you go down first.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.203
Come on.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:46.410
Moby, let's go.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:53.997
Hurry.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:00.962
Chase them!

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.220
Why are we running?

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.886
They're trying to grab Sylvia.

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:08.929
It's not like we would
let them do that...

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.456
Don't we know how to fight back?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.640
There's five or six of them!

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:14.084
Every time David and I fight,
there's always ten guys or more.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.518
Including spectators?

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.435
Let me and four-eyes
prove ourselves.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.613
Stay with Sylvia.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:07.984
- Tough guys!
- Simply super-tough!

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:09.322
So let's go!

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:11.665
Come on...

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:23.841
What is this place?

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.881
I believe it's the
headquarters of filth.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.091
This is a dead end.
We better head back.

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:34.427
What should we do now?

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.395
Find a place to hide.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.451
Who's got a torch?

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.290
I've got one.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.004
You better switch it
off and save the battery.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.378
Take a careful look at everyone.

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:33.159
It really stinks here.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:35.746
I know that. Just be patient.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.305
They're not over here.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:58.804
They clearly entered this place.
Search again.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:17.492
What a relief...

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.284
I can't stand this anymore.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:24.086
You have to, or else
we'll be in big trouble.

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:28.500
Ugh, it's so smelly,
I can't stand it any more!

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:30.797
It's the fatso!

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:33.686
You're so incompetent!
You've ruined everything!

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:34.975
Run!

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:39.935
There's a cash donation over here!
Come and get it!

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:51.898
Move over!

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.904
- They can't be too far away.
- After them!

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:49.335
What do you want?
I'll be happy to help.

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:50.627
I'm glad to hear that.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.000
How can I help you?

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:55.048
Someone hired us to push you down.
You can do it yourself.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.222
Have you got the wrong man?

01:13:58.476 --> 01:13:59.135
No.

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:00.393
Who hired you?

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:01.603
I did.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:03.969
It's you?

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:05.430
You asked people to kidnap me.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:09.021
So I can also ask people to make
you play Superman. Push him down.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.527
Don't! Don't!

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:14.864
Help! Help!

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.778
Please don't! Help!

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.276
Listen to me...

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:20.028
I'm your father...

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.703
He's your father?

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.001
You're my father?

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:28.790
No... I'm not your father.

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:29.916
I'm your father's Butler.

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:32.794
You'd better tell me
the whole story.

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:36.753
Your father is count lobas.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.718
Gloria was working in his
home 20 years ago.

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:42.508
One night, when the
countess was not around, he...

01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:43.893
Raped her?

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.097
And, after Gloria got pregnant,
he was afraid the countess would know.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.270
So he sent Gloria away.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:52.650
Bastard!

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.645
Hey, he's still your father...

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:58.028
I hate him.
I don't ever want to see him.

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.444
You father is already dead.

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:06.666
Before his death, he begged the countess
to search for you and your mother.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:10.120
He didn't want his wicked brother
mondale to inherit the legacy.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:14.336
I didn't disclose the reason
for your safety.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:17.760
I even hired a private detective
to help track you down.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.255
Luckily Moby is not here.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:22.475
Who said so?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.894
I'm always the unlucky one. No one ever
tells me the things I want to know.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:30.085
And for the things I don't want to hear,
a light switch on the radio reveals it all.

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:32.145
I chose the right man
for the job after all.

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:37.564
According to family tradition, Gloria and
Sylvia have to appear within 14 days.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:42.322
Otherwise, the count's brother
mondale will inherit everything.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:45.405
The ones who tried to kidnap Sylvia
must be connected to mondale.

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:47.532
We still have three days.

01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:49.625
Where are you going?

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:53.838
In the past, we helped Sylvia because
we thought that she had no one.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.338
But since she's the daughter of a count,
it's no longer our business.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.721
So what you're saying is...

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:06.392
If Sylvia's an orphan,
then she would be suitable for you.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.807
And you would take her
everywhere you went.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:13.190
But now she's the count's daughter,
you're leaving her on her own?

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:14.733
We really wanted to help her.

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:19.196
Don't you know now's
the time she needs help the most?

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:21.824
Don't you want them
to have better lives?

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:24.238
Of course we want that,
but she has you already.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.528
I'm just one man.

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:27.909
You've seen mondale's men.

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:30.765
There are only a few days left.
They won't give up without a fight.

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:34.959
If you're still her friends,
would you leave her at a time like this?

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:39.254
Enough. Say any more and
we'll have to jump in embarrassment.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:43.133
Let's think of a way
to save her mum.

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:49.139
What are you looking at, bitch?
I'll chop you!

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:59.187
Don't come over!
If you do, I'll chop youl!

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:03.657
- Drop the knife.
- Don't come over!

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:08.033
Let me go!

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:10.490
What are you doing? Let me go!

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:14.918
- Don't be nervous, relax now.
- Don't tie me up, let me go!

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.633
Done.

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:22.762
Let me go.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:27.515
Release you? People will blame me
if they find out. Lie down on the bed.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.352
Turn off the siren.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.163
My mum and your uncle
are dancing over there.

01:17:57.965 --> 01:17:58.545
What's up?

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.707
Your dad and her mum
are dancing over there.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.886
There's a crazy guy here.

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:20.734
His mouth is moving...
Is he eating or speaking?

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.736
I hate guessing games.

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:27.825
I'm not crazy, my friend.
I'm a normal person.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.113
Please loosen the straps.

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:30.615
Are you really as
normal as we are?

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:31.862
Yes.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:33.993
Then test him with a quiz.

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.996
Okay, listen carefully.

01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:40.830
There are three worms in a straight line.
They're moving forward.

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:44.633
The front worm says:
"I have two worms behind me."

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:48.258
The last worm says:
"There are two worms in front of me."

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:52.683
The middle worm says: "There are
no worms in front of or behind me."

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.476
Do you know why?

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:56.223
The middle worm is blind.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:57.315
No.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:00.350
Then I don't know.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.856
Why did you give him
such a difficult quiz?

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:05.984
Is it too difficult?

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.656
Indeed it is.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:12.744
Why would the middle worm say: "There are
no worms in front of or behind me"?

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:16.073
Because the middle worm is lying!

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.577
How can worms lie?
You're pulling his leg.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:22.129
Ignore him.
Why are you tied up here?

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:27.043
It's a secret, I shouldn't
tell too many people.

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:30.004
Come here,
and I'll whisper it to you.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.509
Don't tell other people.
That's it.

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:38.433
So you tell me, shouldn't I
pretend to be crazy?

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.390
What did he tell you?

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:42.770
He said not to tell other people.

01:19:43.237 --> 01:19:46.149
Am I other people?
What did he tell you?

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.856
As I said, he said not
to tell other people.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.239
Still not telling me?

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:52.283
You always hit me!
I'll kill you!

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.662
Hey, hey!

01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:02.503
Damn, this time
my plan backfired.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:09.714
What did you actually
tell him, pal?

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:10.840
Why should I tell you?

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:13.972
If you tell me, I'll untie you,

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.266
I don't trust you.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.808
You promised to tell me.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:26.068
I was telling him not to
tell other people. Understand?

01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:33.902
What is it actually
that cannot be told?

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:38.989
Why should we leave
such a good environment?

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.756
Why are you still here?
Let's go.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:48.878
Where to?

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:52.211
My mum doesn't want to leave uncle chen.
And he doesn't want to leave either.

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:02.429
Tell your dad you
are going to marry Sylvia.

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.684
And that he needs to help
with the wedding arrangement.

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:07.067
Don't lie to elderly
people about such things.

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:10.776
Well, if we add a bit of truth,
it might work.

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:14.199
Sweet talk him into leaving first.

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:17.452
I'll tell him.

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:25.707
Uncle chen, since you like Gloria
so much, why not leave here and marry her?

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.840
That's right.
Why haven't I thought of that?

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:32.338
How can you say that?

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:33.669
Are you objecting?

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:36.307
No.

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:38.223
So no objections?

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:42.640
Gloria, would you marry me?

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:46.515
It took so long for you to ask.
I was getting quite upset.

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.145
Congratulations, uncle chen.

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:56.029
From now on you are
brother and sister. Happy?

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.657
Why so quiet? Aren't you happy?

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:00.905
Call him brother.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.865
Yes, brother.

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:10.164
Don't worry. I've got an idea.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:14.377
When we're out of here,
you disown your father.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:15.513
Clever, right?

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.182
We've done it, finally.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:28.144
Why is there a bulldozer there?

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:29.566
Yeah, why?

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:34.822
So you want me to release the pedals, put on
handbrake, turn off engine, open the door,

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:38.071
get off the car, go check it out,
then come back and tell you?

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:41.862
You could just have asked
me to go. So many words...

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:53.426
What's the matter?

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:57.924
You damn fatso, such a small
task and still you get in trouble.

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:06.522
Moby?

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:28.169
Are you okay?

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:29.664
Not really.

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:38.638
Why did you hit my son?

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:48.981
Let me go!

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.018
Shut up!

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:12.787
Drive the bulldozer away.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:21.866
Why are you still
not reversing the bulldozer?

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:22.925
I don't have the key.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.174
- Then come down and push it.
- Okay.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.600
Why don't you come
down and show me?

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:45.994
The Butler is right,
it's not difficult to enter the castle.

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:48.162
It's difficult if you
want to enter unnoticed.

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:49.584
Let's go.

01:24:52.296 --> 01:24:54.190
If you want to get in,
I have at least seven ways.

01:24:54.214 --> 01:24:56.830
Why such an odd number,
and not six or eight?

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:59.090
Seven is my lucky number.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.420
If your way works,
one way is enough.

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:10.310
Let's go from the back.

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:13.909
There are lots of guards at the front,
but even tigers have to sleep.

01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:15.398
I'm going in from the front.

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:17.096
It's quite dangerous at the front.

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:19.289
- Who will you follow?
- Who will you follow?

01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:21.442
None of your ways suit me.

01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:24.455
We've all got different opinions,
like a bunch of sand grains dissolving.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:28.241
Actually, it's not a bunch since
each of us is only one grain of sand.

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:27.091
Why are you so lousy?

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.381
Go down now
if you have the guts, kid.

01:27:53.059 --> 01:27:55.175
You're right...
Knowing that I got no guts.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:11.023
How are you
planning on going in?

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.119
Through the front gates.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:14.702
There is a guard there.

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:16.321
We'll wait for an opportunity.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.702
Keep waiting like this,
and it will be dawn soon.

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:23.879
Let's climb the tree.

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:28.341
Have you seen an
elephant climb a tree?

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:30.218
Then you keep waiting.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:37.240
Stop playing. Be more alert.
Let's eat.

01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:58.473
You're overthinking it.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:02.473
If I made that spin with the ball,
it would have been a home run.

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:15.528
Let's hide the men.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:25.792
I have some good news for you.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:28.791
Someone is here to save you.

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:33.049
But I also have bad news for you.

01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:35.173
We've already caught him.

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:36.590
Move!

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:42.645
Hi, how are you?

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:45.349
Don't be rude to our guest.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.305
Give your seat to him.

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:49.985
Thank you.

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:56.611
Cheers...

01:30:58.411 --> 01:31:00.493
- What now?
- Let's go home and sleep.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:03.492
Are you kidding?
We should find a way to save them.

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:05.267
You know the answer,
so why still ask me?

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:35.479
Come up.

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:38.485
Up? Up yours maybe!
You think I'm as agile as you?

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:40.199
Find another way, then.

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:15.446
It's me.

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.020
I knew it.

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:19.364
You knew, and you still kicked?

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:22.734
Since you didn't scream when I kicked,
I knew it was you.

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:28.623
Hey, you make me nervous.
Let's split up.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.184
What are you doing up there?

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.283
Are you here for the party?

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:11.040
Yes.

01:33:11.377 --> 01:33:14.744
I told you not to follow me!
You almost spoilt everything.

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:16.546
Fix that guy!

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:20.086
Let's go to the party.

01:33:31.815 --> 01:33:35.854
The dress really suits
your graceful walk.

01:33:36.069 --> 01:33:37.684
Do you mean that I look classy?

01:33:38.154 --> 01:33:39.360
Sit down, mum.

01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:42.272
Yeah, I'm a bit hungry.

01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:50.781
Set another place.
We still have one more guest.

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:54.914
Since you are here...

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:58.254
Why don't you show yourself
in a proper manner?

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:03.343
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry for being late.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:07.676
What's the main course tonight?

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.390
Roast lamb.

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:14.144
I was born in the year of the sheep!

01:34:14.232 --> 01:34:17.349
No wonder I'm so sheepish
in every way tonight.

01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:20.978
I'm happy to welcome
you all tonight.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:27.067
I feel very honoured.
Tonight is an important occasion.

01:34:27.537 --> 01:34:31.280
This evening is a great shame
to the lobas family.

01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:36.330
The family's greatest shame
is having you two as part of it.

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:38.794
Why do you need to be so angry?

01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:43.834
Mr. mondale, if people find out that
you've been holding them here by force,

01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:46.544
it'll affect your reputation.

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:50.382
Thank you for reminding me.
I know what to do now.

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.642
I don't think it's a problem,
because...

01:35:03.072 --> 01:35:04.937
Cardi, take good
care of them for me...

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:05.855
Yes.

01:35:06.075 --> 01:35:07.360
Send the girls to the dungeon.

01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:08.577
Yes.

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:13.746
I haven't finished my soup yet.
Where are you taking me?

01:35:16.169 --> 01:35:17.329
Shut up.

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:28.970
The great general is here!

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:11.425
Stand the pain.
He's not that powerful.

01:36:11.808 --> 01:36:14.424
You take care of him.
I'll help the other side.

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:24.233
Come on!

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:25.985
Come, come.

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.423
I'll deal with him.
You go and save the girls.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:38.330
Can you really handle him?

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:40.871
Not really, you better handle him.
Fight!

01:38:46.546 --> 01:38:48.537
I block, block, block...

01:38:50.216 --> 01:38:51.752
Dirty trick... stabbing my back?

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:07.623
This guy's quite powerful.

01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:11.953
Don't be nervous, relax.

01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:15.415
Pretend it's a training session.

01:40:25.937 --> 01:40:26.937
One more time.

01:41:01.389 --> 01:41:02.504
Wait.

01:41:06.811 --> 01:41:10.520
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four...

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:38.164
Tickle, tickle...

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.640
You're good.

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:52.230
Hit me.

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:54.559
Hit me.

01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:03.197
Shouldn't aim too high
when one is not ready for it.

01:42:37.943 --> 01:42:40.559
Wow, this punch was powerful.

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.828
If you've got the guts,
pull me up for another round.

01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:36.408
Don't let go, pal.
Pull me up, please.

01:45:17.937 --> 01:45:20.679
- You're still not finished fighting?
- I was waiting for you two.

01:45:28.072 --> 01:45:29.072
The three musketeers.

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:30.521
Nothing is impossible.

01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:32.064
Let's get him at the top.

01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:34.407
Get him at the bottom.

01:45:38.499 --> 01:45:40.205
Precise and coordinated attack.

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:47.080
And we're invincible.

01:45:53.097 --> 01:45:54.382
Hi.

01:45:55.558 --> 01:45:56.673
How are you?

01:45:57.142 --> 01:45:58.257
What would you like, miss?

01:45:58.394 --> 01:45:59.975
One hamburger and a coke.

01:46:00.521 --> 01:46:02.011
Have a seat over there.

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.609
Be happy, brother.
It's not healthy to be lovesick.

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:11.937
Prepare this order.

01:46:14.702 --> 01:46:15.942
David, come out.

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:18.907
- What's up?
- Look.

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:47.435
Nice of you to visit us.

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:50.480
I'm here to look for a job.
Would you hire me for the summer?

01:46:50.613 --> 01:46:51.819
Of course.

01:46:52.114 --> 01:46:55.072
You probably wish that this
summer will never end.

01:46:55.868 --> 01:46:57.574
Hi, how are you?

01:46:58.203 --> 01:46:59.909
How's it going,
great unlicensed detective?

01:47:00.039 --> 01:47:04.703
Hold it. I just got my
international detective membership.

01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:06.538
I'm qualified now.

01:47:07.212 --> 01:47:08.418
Congratulations.

01:47:08.714 --> 01:47:10.796
Do you want to
expand your business?

01:47:11.216 --> 01:47:15.084
Do another assignment with me,
and I can give you 20 fastfood vans.

01:47:15.971 --> 01:47:17.086
Another castle?

01:47:17.181 --> 01:47:19.092
No, it's a hut.

01:47:19.224 --> 01:47:21.510
That's easy? Who are we saving?

01:47:21.977 --> 01:47:23.467
It's an African president.

01:47:23.562 --> 01:47:26.304
He's been kidnapped
by some cannibals in Africa.

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:31.225
Cannibals!

01:47:31.528 --> 01:47:32.938
Someone's looking for you.

01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:52.121
The pedestrians on the road
are walking at a slow pace

01:47:52.216 --> 01:47:54.923
yet I'm rushing with
all my strength

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:02.889
How would I have time
to be depressed

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:07.724
even if I accidentally
fall on the road,

01:48:08.107 --> 01:48:10.974
I believe I have the strength
to stand back up

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:15.603
although it's a hard life,

01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:18.571
I'll still be having a fresh smile

01:48:18.826 --> 01:48:20.657
it's all about belief

01:48:20.744 --> 01:48:23.156
no point in dreaming,
keep walking with strength

01:48:23.497 --> 01:48:26.614
I'm getting closer to my dream

01:48:26.834 --> 01:48:31.203
with faith I'm free
to pursue my dream

01:48:31.588 --> 01:48:34.796
with you leading me,
I'll grow in confidence

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:42.759
I'm looking for myself
and replanting my roots

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:49.053
and with happiness, even if it
slipped away, I can still stand back up
