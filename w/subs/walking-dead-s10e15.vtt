00:03.754 --> 00:05.339
'Sup?

00:05.422 --> 00:07.341
YUMIKO: Who are you?

00:07.424 --> 00:10.135
What do you want?
Excuse me?

00:10.219 --> 00:12.679
You guys were the ones
calling out and making a racket.

00:12.763 --> 00:13.764
I thought you needed help,

00:13.847 --> 00:14.848
but now you're acting
like I'm the one

00:14.932 --> 00:16.725
causing a problem here?

00:16.808 --> 00:19.603
Damn. I haven't seen anyone
in over a year,

00:19.686 --> 00:23.273
and the first ones I find
seem like a bunch of meanies.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.567
You just caught us
off guard.

00:25.651 --> 00:28.153
-We didn't know if you were attacking...
-PRINCESS: Seriously?

00:28.237 --> 00:31.281
If I wanted to attack,
I'd hold the gun like this...

00:31.365 --> 00:33.534
with the dangerous part
pointed at you, see?

00:33.617 --> 00:35.202
That's for attacking.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.913
The other way,
that's for hello.

00:37.996 --> 00:41.875
So, as we can all agree,
I wasn't attacking.

00:41.959 --> 00:45.170
But now...

00:45.254 --> 00:47.130
Now I'm not so sure.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.841
Maybe that's up to you.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.259
Are you gonna hurt me?

00:50.342 --> 00:52.761
Keep pointing the damn gun
at us, and you'll find out.

00:52.845 --> 00:56.431
EZEKIEL: No one has any intention
of hurting you.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.895
We were just admiring
your displays.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.606
Are they yours?

01:04.690 --> 01:06.066
Crap. Sorry.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.860
Do you like 'em?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.903
Yeah, not many rotters
left in the city,

01:09.987 --> 01:12.281
so I put these up
as my decorations.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.283
Pain in the ass
to put together,

01:14.366 --> 01:16.660
but they make the place
feel more alive.

01:16.743 --> 01:21.206
Although now that I've met
actual live people again...

01:22.583 --> 01:24.918
Hold on.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.378
You guys are real, right?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.548
-Is that supposed to be a joke?
-PRINCESS: I dunno.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.924
I mean,
I never hallucinated before,

01:31.008 --> 01:32.509
but there's a first time
for everything.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.178
Uh, say something
I wouldn't know.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.305
Like, uh...

01:36.388 --> 01:37.848
what's the capital
of Pennsylvania?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.474
Harrisburg.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.934
Did I know that?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.477
I think I knew that.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.897
Ha!
Maybe I am hallucinating.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.316
-This is... This is wild.
-Hey.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.609
You certain
it's just you out here?

01:48.692 --> 01:50.152
Didn't I already
tell you that?

01:50.235 --> 01:52.321
I've been on my own
for over a year,

01:52.404 --> 01:55.324
and it totally sucks.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.910
Da... damn.
I should be nicer.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.870
Talking to possibly
real people again

01:59.953 --> 02:01.330
is making me freak out.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.831
You... I'm just...

02:02.915 --> 02:04.791
I'm just gonna shut up.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.130
I'm Juanita Sanchez.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.549
But I never liked
the name Juanita.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.967
You can call me Princess.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.511
Why "Princess"?

02:15.594 --> 02:18.889
Because "Queen"
makes me sound old.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.474
And pretentious.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.522
EZEKIEL: It's a pleasure
to meet you, Princess.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.358
I am Ezekiel.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.110
And these are my friends,
Eugene and Yumiko.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.946
PRINCESS: Wow!

02:34.029 --> 02:35.072
Let me show
you guys around.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.783
We got plenty of space
for you to chill out,

02:37.866 --> 02:39.326
put your feet up.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.870
Y'all need supplies?
You need food?

02:41.954 --> 02:43.038
Hair dye?

02:43.121 --> 02:45.290
I've got a neat place
for us to swim

02:45.374 --> 02:46.667
a couple blocks away.

02:46.750 --> 02:50.170
We appreciate the hospitality,
but we can't stay.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.630
Oh. O-Okay.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.131
We're on
a very important mission.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.883
Ohhh!
What sorta mission?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.468
YUMIKO:
Uh, that's our business.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.679
PRINCESS: Well, let me least show you
the best way through the city.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.597
-No, thank you.
-Oh, come on. Why not?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.933
(SCOFFS)
Because we don't know you.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.394
(LAUGHS)
Of course you do.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.813
Princess?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.398
I'm great.
You'll see.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:34.358 --> 04:36.818
EZEKIEL:
At least it's not a total loss.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.029
And we can still find
the horses tomorrow.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.489
Not to be a naysayer,

04:40.572 --> 04:44.201
but our rendezvous window
is tighter than a tourniquet.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.286
I have doubts that it'll be possible
to make the journey by foot.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.497
Any additional day
spent on an empty search

04:48.580 --> 04:50.832
would place us on
the failure side of that window.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.461
So, if it's possible to walk,
we start now.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.296
Missing this meeting
isn't an option.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.800
We've got way too many people
counting on us back home.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.886
What about Princess?
She offered to help.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.513
Why don't
we take her up on it?

05:10.936 --> 05:11.979
Absolutely not.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.064
-What could it hurt?
-YUMIKO: Plenty.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.067
Anyone alone for this long
ends up selfish, crazy...

05:17.150 --> 05:18.569
in her case, definitely both.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.405
We can't trust her.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.658
I'm not suggesting
that we follow her blindly.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.118
But if she knows how to find
transportation...

05:26.201 --> 05:30.080
Then she wouldn't
still be here, alone.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.749
Look, if she had a ride,
why hasn't she left?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.251
It's a trap.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.920
Is Princess a few bananas
short of a bunch?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.213
Possibly.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.174
Does she have access
to automobiles and working fuel?

05:40.257 --> 05:41.466
Unlikely.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.260
But at present,
we possess limited options,

05:43.343 --> 05:46.597
so even a slim possibility
is worth investigating.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.766
Apologies, Yumiko.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.226

what happened.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.951
Let me make it up
to you guys.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.829
You mentioned you had access
to some transportation?

06:10.913 --> 06:13.290
A whole garage full. Tons of choices.
I'll take you there.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.459
You want us to follow you,
you hand over your gun.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.711

06:17.794 --> 06:20.380
Really wanna spend time
with living people again,

but I'm not sure
I trust you, either.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.384
I mean, I'm outnumbered.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.428
I could probably take out
one of you,

06:26.512 --> 06:27.804
two if I'm lucky.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.515
But then he'd still be left
to kill me anyways.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.891
So why even try?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.559
Unless I have a death wish,

06:32.643 --> 06:34.269
which, clearly, I don't

06:34.353 --> 06:36.230
because I have been living here
alone for so long.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.481
See?

06:42.236 --> 06:44.780
Fine. You can have it.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.911
I know where to find
more guns, anyway.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.956
So, then, the garage?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.457
Right. Yeah. Of course.

-Any sign of slowing?
-Not yet.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.547
We'll stay on them.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.382
If anything changes,
we'll send word.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.842
Copy that.
Be safe.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.427
Same. Over.

16:15.851 --> 16:16.894
How much longer
do you reckon?

16:16.977 --> 16:18.395
Almost there.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.314
If this is a waste
of our time...

16:20.397 --> 16:22.482
It'll be worth it.
Don't worry!

16:25.110 --> 16:27.404
Make sure you guys
stay close to me,

16:27.487 --> 16:30.032
and please watch your step.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.542
<i>Tres...</i>

16:40.626 --> 16:42.669
<i>Cuatro...</i>

16:42.753 --> 16:44.046
<i>Cinco...</i>

16:52.554 --> 16:55.849
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

17:01.605 --> 17:04.024
Starting to wonder
if you were right about her.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.026
Oh, I am.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.028
But let's figure out
what she's up to first.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.575
<i>Cincuenta y cuatro...</i>

17:13.659 --> 17:15.577
<i>Cincuenta y cinco...</i>

17:15.661 --> 17:18.789
Is there a particular method
behind this navigational technique,

17:18.872 --> 17:20.874
or are you just
meandering about?

17:23.544 --> 17:26.338
Holy crap.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.923
I think I just
found your horse.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.761
Did walkers eat it?

17:32.845 --> 17:35.264
No, it probably just
stepped on one of the mines.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.728
What do you particularly mean
by the term "mines"?

17:41.812 --> 17:43.397
You know,
those things you step on

17:43.480 --> 17:44.648
and then they go boom.

17:46.525 --> 17:49.152
Are you saying you brought us
into a minefield?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.196
Well, yeah.
But it... it's a small one.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.198
What's wrong with you?

17:53.282 --> 17:54.533
Why would you keep that
from us?

17:54.616 --> 17:55.951
I just didn't
want you to worry.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.119
I told you
we couldn't trust her.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.745
I walk this all the time!

17:58.829 --> 18:00.873
It's no big deal.
I got the route right up here.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.833
-So you can get us out?
-Of course.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.460
As soon as I figure out
where we left off.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.004
Excuse me?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.714
Well, I don't normally stop
in the middle,

18:08.797 --> 18:10.632
so I kinda lost count.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.718
I Just need a minute
to think.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.262
Either you get us out of here safely,
or I'll kill you myself.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.639
That's fair.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.326
(EXPLOSION)

18:40.746 --> 18:44.291
Ah. Guess not.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.629
Anyone have
an extra canteen?

18:56.094 --> 18:57.930
CAROL: Damn it.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.851
Almost have it.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.442
(CLANKS)

19:16.365 --> 19:18.116
Thanks.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.660
You're welcome.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.290
Thanks for coming.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.253
You don't have to do that.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.005
It's okay.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.590
No, it's not.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.637
If I could go back...

19:40.722 --> 19:43.433
I'm so sorry, Kelly,
for everything.

19:43.517 --> 19:44.893
She's not dead.

19:45.978 --> 19:47.354
She's not.

19:50.941 --> 19:55.529
Maybe it's because
she's so tough

19:56.864 --> 19:58.365
to survive anything.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.496
Maybe there's just this
part of me that...

20:04.580 --> 20:07.958
won't accept
that she's gone.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.503
(INHALES SHARPLY)
And, uh, so...

20:11.587 --> 20:13.881
I understand you.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.967
Why you did all of it.

20:20.596 --> 20:23.640
It doesn't mean
I should have.

20:27.728 --> 20:32.149
When I started
losing my hearing...

20:32.232 --> 20:36.445
my sister told me
that it wasn't my weakness.

20:36.528 --> 20:39.364
It was my...

20:40.866 --> 20:42.326
superpower.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.960
And now look.

20:52.044 --> 20:56.632
Everyone's learning sign
because of me.

20:56.715 --> 21:01.261
You think that the way you are is...
is a weakness?

21:01.345 --> 21:04.598
(SCOFFS)

21:04.681 --> 21:08.936
I heard the stories about you,
in the old days.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.354
We all have.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.439
(CHUCKLES)

21:12.523 --> 21:16.902
That you... you'd just go off.

21:16.985 --> 21:20.948
And do the thing
that only you can do.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.368
Lone wolf.

21:26.078 --> 21:28.956
That's your superpower.

21:29.039 --> 21:33.585
You can't give up everything
about yourself because...

21:33.669 --> 21:35.712
(SIGHS)

21:35.796 --> 21:38.590
...bad things happen.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.718
I gotta believe that.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.609
Hey.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.403
I, um...

21:59.486 --> 22:02.656
I don't think you've eaten
anything today.

22:02.739 --> 22:03.991
I'm good.

22:04.074 --> 22:06.785
You know, I can't tell
if it's just one of those things

22:06.869 --> 22:11.123
or the craziness of us all
moving to an abandoned tower...

22:11.206 --> 22:13.292
or if you're just
avoiding me.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.461
I'm avoiding you.

22:18.213 --> 22:22.050
Well, shit, that... that's honest.

22:22.134 --> 22:26.054
You want me to lie?

22:26.138 --> 22:27.806
Make you feel better?

22:30.517 --> 22:31.977
No, I don't.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.605
Okay. Well, you can give
someone else the rat stew.

22:34.688 --> 22:39.026
It's not rat.
It's possum.

22:39.109 --> 22:43.822
I mean, yeah, basically
a big rat, but I, um...

22:43.906 --> 22:46.325
I just wanted to say...

22:46.408 --> 22:48.994
that I liked her.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.663
Your mom, I mean,
she did some horrible shit

22:51.747 --> 22:54.374
that there's no excusing
any of it, but...

22:54.458 --> 22:56.001
I liked...

22:56.084 --> 22:58.045
I liked a lot of things
about her.

22:58.128 --> 23:01.006
And I wish to God
I didn't have to do what I did.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.300
But if there's something
that you wanna say to me,

23:03.383 --> 23:05.761
then you should say it.

23:08.514 --> 23:09.973
Most of us wish
you'd died, too.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.164
We never should
have followed her.

23:34.248 --> 23:37.709
This is exactly the kind of thing
I was afraid would happen.

23:37.793 --> 23:40.212
I have been afraid
of many things.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.590
But this one's new.

23:43.674 --> 23:44.675
Just as an FYI,

23:44.758 --> 23:46.844
we're running out of time
on multiple fronts.

23:46.927 --> 23:49.054
(WALKER GROWLING)

23:49.137 --> 23:51.223
Fence instability
being the most pressing.

23:51.306 --> 23:53.350
But I'm also concerned
with improper mine placement,

23:53.433 --> 23:55.853
-which could lead to a cascade.
-YUMIKO: What's a cascade?

24:00.440 --> 24:01.692
Chain reaction.

24:01.775 --> 24:02.776
You don't want to be
stuck in the middle

24:02.860 --> 24:05.028
when more of these puppies
start popping off.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.905
Maybe there's something I can do.

24:17.082 --> 24:19.668
I'm kinda blowing this,
huh?

24:19.751 --> 24:22.796
-It's not ideal.
-(SIGHS)

24:22.880 --> 24:25.924
But leading us to safety
could go a long way.

24:26.008 --> 24:27.217
Of course.

24:27.301 --> 24:30.387
I just wanna say
I didn't mean to.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.264
I'm sorry, y'know?

24:32.347 --> 24:35.058
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

24:38.645 --> 24:40.814

I'm still here.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.125
Cool.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.002
We should be good
from here, guys.

A hunter moves,

25:23.857 --> 25:26.193
everything else
moves around it.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.904
Try to spot things
that don't belong,

25:28.987 --> 25:31.573
things that just don't
feel right.

25:31.657 --> 25:33.200
Now take a look.

25:33.283 --> 25:34.868
Tell me what you see.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.553

roundin' more up.

Hey! You put our lives
in danger back there.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.305
For what?
I didn't.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.890
Let's all just take a...
No, no, no, no, no.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.058
Our friends, our families,
are depending on us.

26:40.142 --> 26:41.476
She may not have anyone
left to care about,

26:41.560 --> 26:42.561
but we sure as hell do.

26:42.644 --> 26:43.979
I'm sorry.

Fleetwood Drive.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.734
EZEKIEL: What?

26:48.817 --> 26:50.360
We passed Fleetwood Drive earlier.

26:50.444 --> 26:52.321
PRINCESS: Uh, must've been
a different Fleetwood.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.740
We've got like five of them
all over the city,

26:54.823 --> 26:57.034
streets, avenues, roads,
it's super confusing.

26:57.117 --> 26:59.328
No, it was most certainly
Fleetwood Drive.

26:59.411 --> 27:00.787
I remember seeing the sign
and saying to myself,

27:00.871 --> 27:02.748
"Granddaddy used to drive
a Fleetwood."

27:04.291 --> 27:05.292
YUMIKO:
You've led us around all day

27:05.375 --> 27:07.878
when we could've
walked straight here?

27:07.961 --> 27:10.631
-Is that true?
-Um...

27:10.714 --> 27:13.217
-EZEKIEL: Yumiko...
-You better tell us what you're up to,

27:13.300 --> 27:14.510
and maybe
I'll leave you here alive.

27:14.593 --> 27:17.513
PRINCESS: Okay, okay, okay.
I might've maybe sort of

27:17.596 --> 27:19.181
missed the turn
onto Fleetwood earlier

27:19.264 --> 27:21.141
but only because I was
having too much fun!

27:21.225 --> 27:23.227
And then I figured,
we could take the scenic route

27:23.310 --> 27:25.521
instead of turning around
and keep the fun going!

27:25.604 --> 27:28.941
-Into a minefield.
-Which looks bad, I know.

27:29.024 --> 27:31.443
But I'd been through it
like a billion times before,

27:31.527 --> 27:33.862
and I never thought
it was gonna to be a problem

27:33.946 --> 27:35.531
until it was.

27:35.614 --> 27:37.741
All I wanted
was to show you the garage,

27:37.824 --> 27:40.619
and then you'd be like,
"Princess, you're amazing!

27:40.702 --> 27:43.247
We want to stay
and be friends!"

27:43.330 --> 27:44.790
But, no...

27:44.873 --> 27:46.875
I screwed it up.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.378
I see that now. Yeah.

27:49.461 --> 27:51.255
Shit.

27:54.508 --> 27:55.676
When I was first here,
by myself,

27:55.759 --> 27:57.803
I figured somebody else
would show up eventually.

27:57.886 --> 27:58.929
Odds are, right?

27:59.012 --> 28:00.764
And then days
turned into months.

28:00.848 --> 28:04.142
And it was so empty.
But then I realized,

28:04.226 --> 28:05.394
this isn't that different

28:05.477 --> 28:07.145
from how I felt
before all this.

28:07.229 --> 28:09.022
(CHUCKLES)

28:09.106 --> 28:12.901
This one time,
someone told me,

28:12.985 --> 28:14.611
"You're hard to love."

28:16.154 --> 28:17.322
So maybe it's me.

28:17.406 --> 28:18.949
Maybe I deserve this.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.659
And all day,

28:20.742 --> 28:23.287
I kept hearing that little voice
in my head,

28:23.370 --> 28:25.455
"It's me."

28:25.539 --> 28:28.750
And I know I should've...
turned around,

28:28.834 --> 28:30.127
or told you guys the truth,

28:30.210 --> 28:31.879
but I didn't want that voice
to be right.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.424
So...

28:35.507 --> 28:37.634
I am sorry.

28:45.684 --> 28:48.270
I have an all-too-familiar
sense of how you feel.

28:56.737 --> 28:59.031
I've made poor decisions.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.991
Lied to folks.

29:01.074 --> 29:05.162
The inevitable alternative
meant being left alone.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.372
No one wants that.

29:07.456 --> 29:09.166
Yeah.

29:12.753 --> 29:14.880
Just to clarify,

29:14.963 --> 29:17.382
you do have access
to those wheels, correct?

29:33.232 --> 29:36.235
(BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

29:39.154 --> 29:41.198

29:41.281 --> 29:43.033

(BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

29:44.409 --> 29:47.788
I will if you pull this
outta me.

29:47.871 --> 29:49.748
I can't die like this.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.542
It ain't natural.

29:52.793 --> 29:54.670
You drop the knife,
I'll think about it.

29:54.753 --> 29:58.048
(BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

29:58.131 --> 29:59.341
Where're your people?

29:59.424 --> 30:01.260
A few miles east.

30:01.343 --> 30:04.096
Headed to the ocean.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.598
Are they with the horde?

30:06.682 --> 30:07.808
You a scout?

30:07.891 --> 30:09.935
I was...

30:10.018 --> 30:11.436
going off on my own.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.855
Why?

30:12.938 --> 30:14.189
I had no choice.

30:15.566 --> 30:19.361
I love those people,
but he's...

30:19.444 --> 30:22.823
I couldn't stay there.

30:22.906 --> 30:25.200
He's what?

30:25.284 --> 30:27.452
Lost it.

30:27.536 --> 30:30.122
After what you did
to her.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.709
Will you take this out?

30:33.792 --> 30:35.961
Does he know where we are?

30:36.044 --> 30:37.921
I don't know.

30:40.424 --> 30:42.801
But he's gonna keep
coming for you.

30:42.885 --> 30:44.636
(BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

30:44.720 --> 30:45.971
You took too much.

30:46.054 --> 30:47.764
No, please.

30:47.848 --> 30:50.017
Please.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.020
I want to walk after.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.105
Does he know
where we are?

30:55.189 --> 30:57.316
I don't know.

30:57.399 --> 30:59.234
I mean it.

30:59.318 --> 31:02.112
(BREATHING SHALLOWLY)

31:02.196 --> 31:04.823
(BREATHING STOPS)

31:15.834 --> 31:17.544
You didn't have to do that.

31:17.628 --> 31:20.088
She didn't have any information
for us, anyway.

31:21.757 --> 31:23.467
She was gonna die.

31:23.550 --> 31:24.968
Better to be quick.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.723
We're gonna leave her?

31:29.806 --> 31:31.266
Come on.

31:33.435 --> 31:34.686
Maybe she has a family.

31:38.023 --> 31:40.651
Look, if they're only
a few miles away,

31:40.734 --> 31:43.570
maybe we can spot something
from the top of the tower.

31:47.950 --> 31:49.952
(GROWLING)

31:50.035 --> 31:53.455
Faith. Faith.

31:53.539 --> 31:56.083
Faith. Watch.

31:58.001 --> 32:01.088
Learn.

WHISPERING VOICE: <i>They flee</i>

32:28.073 --> 32:29.992

32:38.959 --> 32:41.378
(LAUGHS)

32:43.755 --> 32:45.883
Still no sign of slowing?

32:45.966 --> 32:47.885
You think this can work?

32:47.968 --> 32:49.636
This plan?

32:49.720 --> 32:52.181
Has to, doesn't it?

32:52.264 --> 32:54.057
I guess so.

32:57.352 --> 32:59.271
Always thought,

32:59.354 --> 33:01.773
once Alpha was dead...

33:01.857 --> 33:03.442
it'd be easier
to see light.

33:04.693 --> 33:06.486
Past what we lost,
y'know?

33:06.570 --> 33:08.322
I don't know about
seeing past.

33:09.740 --> 33:12.034
But I can fight here,

33:12.117 --> 33:14.077
try to make sure
we don't lose again.

33:15.454 --> 33:17.748
For Gracie, Adam.

33:17.831 --> 33:19.249
Whatever it takes.

33:21.835 --> 33:23.629
Then, all this loss will maybe
add up to something...

33:23.712 --> 33:25.631
Hold on.
Are they slowing down?

33:28.342 --> 33:29.593
No.

33:31.512 --> 33:33.138
They're changing direction.
Toward the tower.

33:33.222 --> 33:34.556
Call it in.
Yeah.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.643
(RADIO STATIC)

33:39.853 --> 33:41.146
It's no good.

33:42.773 --> 33:44.483
We got to leave now.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.492
(GUN COCKS)

34:02.960 --> 34:04.753
You don't get to tell me
what to do.

34:06.338 --> 34:08.882
You're right. I can't.

34:08.966 --> 34:11.093
Hey.

34:11.176 --> 34:12.678
I think
that you should hit me.

34:12.761 --> 34:14.388
And it will make you
feel better.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.516
I feel fine.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.935
You have to mourn her.

34:20.018 --> 34:22.020
You know,
you need to say goodbye.

34:22.104 --> 34:24.523
Otherwise, it's gonna
eat you up from the insides.

34:26.066 --> 34:29.570
Just... Just trust me on this.

34:29.653 --> 34:32.614
Look,
she was still your mom.

34:32.698 --> 34:35.534
You know?
And we only get the one.

34:35.617 --> 34:38.412
So you... you should hit me...

34:38.495 --> 34:42.165
and just try
to let it out.

34:42.249 --> 34:44.668
Otherwise, you are gonna drift
further from these people,

34:44.751 --> 34:46.461
and I know
you don't want that.

34:46.545 --> 34:48.338
The hell do you know
what I want, huh?

34:48.422 --> 34:50.090
Tell me.

34:50.174 --> 34:53.135
You're a selfish asshole.

34:53.218 --> 34:54.261
You only killed her

34:54.344 --> 34:56.680
so they'd think
that you're a hero.

34:56.763 --> 34:59.516
But nothing you do will ever
make you that here!

34:59.600 --> 35:02.019
Because you only care
about yourself.

35:02.102 --> 35:05.147
Even now,
trying to get me to do this?

35:05.230 --> 35:06.899
You liked her?

35:06.982 --> 35:09.985
How the hell can you tell me
you liked her, huh?

35:10.068 --> 35:11.528
I hated her!

35:11.612 --> 35:13.155
I want to hate her,

35:13.238 --> 35:16.950
so screw you for telling me
I can't even do that!

35:17.034 --> 35:18.160
It's okay, Lydia.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.494
(CRYING) No!

35:19.578 --> 35:21.121
It's not okay!

35:21.205 --> 35:22.789
It's not okay!

35:22.873 --> 35:24.625
It's not okay!

35:24.708 --> 35:26.460
It's not... not...

35:26.543 --> 35:29.546
(SOBBING)

35:33.258 --> 35:34.635
It's okay.

35:37.471 --> 35:38.972
It's okay.

35:42.726 --> 35:45.854
(GARAGE DOOR OPENS)

35:51.610 --> 35:53.445
Wheels.

35:53.529 --> 35:55.322
Yeah.

35:55.405 --> 35:58.242
Not exactly the kind of ride
I was picturing, but...

35:58.325 --> 36:00.327
15 miles per hour
is a significant increase

36:00.410 --> 36:02.871
over walking.

36:02.955 --> 36:04.748
(CLEARS THROAT)

36:04.831 --> 36:08.877
To be fair, she wasn't
lying about the garage.

36:12.005 --> 36:14.132
She came through.

36:15.717 --> 36:18.011
(CHUCKLES)

36:18.095 --> 36:20.180
Oh, man.

36:20.264 --> 36:22.349
(CLEARS THROAT)

36:22.432 --> 36:25.561
Listen, I... I'm not a bad person.

36:25.644 --> 36:27.271
I want you to know that.

36:27.354 --> 36:31.191
And you had every reason
not to trust me.

36:31.275 --> 36:34.319
It's so hard to take a chance
on people in this world.

36:34.403 --> 36:36.029
And when those people
lie to you, well...

36:36.113 --> 36:38.448
Yeah. I know.

36:38.532 --> 36:40.242
It sucks.

36:40.325 --> 36:41.410
I blew it.

36:41.493 --> 36:43.120
I know.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.997
And I'm sorry.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.665
I guess...

36:46.748 --> 36:48.208
I wish I had
done things better,

36:48.292 --> 36:51.712
but I guess my people skills
are pretty rusty.

36:51.795 --> 36:53.881
Well, that's something we're
gonna have to work on, then.

36:55.382 --> 36:58.385
I was coming over here to see
if you wanted to join us.

37:04.016 --> 37:05.893
Wait. For real?

37:05.976 --> 37:08.562
Yeah, as long as you don't
lie to us again, okay?

37:08.645 --> 37:09.813
Yes.

37:09.897 --> 37:12.691
Yes, yes, yes!
(LAUGHS)

37:12.774 --> 37:13.984
Yes, yes!
Oh, okay.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.903
Well,
you know the area, so...

37:15.986 --> 37:17.696
(LAUGHING)

37:17.779 --> 37:19.865
Do we have enough time to grab
stuff from my stash?

37:19.948 --> 37:22.284
I-I-I've got food
and clothes

37:22.367 --> 37:25.287
and a cool spear
and some candy.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.122
Does this mean
I get to have my gun back?

37:27.206 --> 37:28.373
Can I know
where we're going?

37:28.457 --> 37:30.292
Is there a map?
Do I get to hold it?

37:42.638 --> 37:44.181
What is it?

37:45.557 --> 37:48.018
I can't believe
we just left her.

37:48.101 --> 37:50.062
In a ditch.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.734
What if you were lost...

37:56.902 --> 37:58.529
and no one could find you?

38:00.030 --> 38:02.449
Or RJ was.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.451
Or Mom.

38:06.411 --> 38:09.122
You gotta tell me
where this is coming from.

38:10.832 --> 38:13.377
I just want us to be
back together again.

38:15.045 --> 38:17.256
At home.

38:17.339 --> 38:18.674
That's all.

38:18.757 --> 38:20.592
I radioed your mom

38:20.676 --> 38:23.345
so she knows not to go home,
so she's safe.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.681
And that way,
she can find us.

38:25.764 --> 38:27.516
You talked to her?

38:27.599 --> 38:29.518
No.

38:29.601 --> 38:31.061
But I'm gonna
keep trying.

38:34.857 --> 38:36.233
It doesn't matter.

38:39.903 --> 38:42.489
I talked to her
after the fire.

38:42.573 --> 38:44.116
And I'm worried...

38:45.367 --> 38:47.035
maybe she won't
come home.

38:48.787 --> 38:50.122
DARYL: What'd she say?

38:52.249 --> 38:55.961
She went to go help
some people she met.

38:56.044 --> 38:57.129
Who needed her.

38:59.173 --> 39:01.592
I didn't wanna tell you.

39:01.675 --> 39:02.801
Why's that?

39:06.597 --> 39:08.223
'Cause maybe
you'd leave, too.

39:11.727 --> 39:13.437
I won't.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.938
You promise?

39:16.190 --> 39:17.357
I can't.

39:17.441 --> 39:20.027
Why?
Because I can't lie to you.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.030
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

39:24.323 --> 39:26.241
And there ain't no one
that can tell you that they do.

39:28.368 --> 39:29.870
And there's one thing
I know.

39:31.121 --> 39:32.456
There's a whole bunch of people
back there

39:32.539 --> 39:34.958
that'd do anything
for you.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.793
And one day,
when you're older,

39:36.877 --> 39:39.838
they're gonna need you to do
anything for them.

39:39.922 --> 39:42.007
You got
a whole lot of family.

39:53.227 --> 39:57.105
Nothing can take the place of
someone you love being gone.

39:57.189 --> 39:59.149
But that doesn't mean
that everything that follows

39:59.233 --> 40:00.776
is gonna break your heart.

40:14.915 --> 40:16.333
Hey.

40:16.416 --> 40:18.293
