WEBVTT

05:27.833 --> 05:30.166
Have you taught them nothing,
you useless fuck?

05:30.250 --> 05:31.583
-Sorry, sir--
-What "sorry"?

06:23.375 --> 06:25.583
Papa, know what this is called?

06:25.666 --> 06:26.625
What?

06:26.708 --> 06:28.333
It's called "clavicle."

06:31.791 --> 06:34.125
And these are called "shoulders."

06:34.791 --> 06:36.750
And this is called "backbone."

06:38.291 --> 06:40.875
-And what's this called?
-These are called "cheeks."

06:40.958 --> 06:43.208
-And what's this called?
-This is called "nose."

06:43.291 --> 06:44.583
And what's this called?

07:02.750 --> 07:04.916
LONG LIVE THE GREAT SOCIALIST

07:07.333 --> 07:08.958
Hey, Balram!

07:39.291 --> 07:41.291
Don't make me ask again!

07:49.875 --> 07:53.458
Get your book and chalk, let's go.

07:57.541 --> 08:00.666
The tea shop? I'm supposed to go to Delhi.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.000
Father didn't pay the master.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.958
Granny said you have to work now.

08:06.041 --> 08:06.875
Kishan!

08:07.458 --> 08:09.958
What're you doing over there? Get to work!

08:14.250 --> 08:16.125
Now break every last one.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.000
You don't like it?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.375
Imagine it's my skull you're breaking.

08:37.625 --> 08:38.625
Hey, sweetie…

08:39.291 --> 08:40.625
Eat your dinner.

08:45.708 --> 08:46.708
Eat it.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.708
I'll find a doctor.

09:24.166 --> 09:29.583
God's name is the truth…

12:15.541 --> 12:18.791
Would you like some tea?
Put on some tea!

12:21.750 --> 12:22.791
Make it quickly.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.333
Are you deaf? Get to work.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.125
THE GREAT SOCIALIST

13:22.333 --> 13:26.458
I overheard them saying
they need a second driver for Mr. Ashok.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.041
He's just come back--

13:28.125 --> 13:30.041
But you don't know how to drive!

13:31.166 --> 13:36.125
I just need 300 rupees
for the driving lessons and--

13:36.208 --> 13:40.541
No! You've always
been insolent like your father.

13:40.625 --> 13:43.000
You'll stay right here with Kishan.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.333
Okay, forget it.

13:56.291 --> 13:59.750
I thought if I became their driver,
you'd buy a bunch of water buffaloes…

14:00.458 --> 14:02.250
and be the envy of the village.

14:02.333 --> 14:06.375
So you'll become
a driver for the landlords?

14:07.875 --> 14:10.500
You could be
the richest woman in the village.

14:10.583 --> 14:15.375
Swear on all the gods you believe in

14:15.458 --> 14:21.791
that you'll send every rupee,
every month, to your Granny.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.833
-I swear.
-Stop smiling!

14:24.541 --> 14:26.333
Pinch your hand and swear!

14:26.416 --> 14:29.416
I'm pinching! Granny, just think…

14:29.500 --> 14:31.875
You'll become
the richest woman in the village.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.541
This cane will become gold,
and when you swing it like this,

14:35.625 --> 14:37.666
the entire village
will line up to see you.

14:41.708 --> 14:44.583
Wait! Granny made your favorite!

14:44.666 --> 14:47.583
You eat your oily okra!
I'm gonna eat in Dhanbad!

15:26.666 --> 15:28.666
Watch out, sister-fucker!

15:28.750 --> 15:31.125
You're from a caste of sweet makers.

15:31.208 --> 15:34.791
Only a boy from a warrior class
can tame a wild stallion.

15:34.875 --> 15:38.250
Muslims, Rajputs, Sikhs
have aggression in their blood.

15:38.791 --> 15:43.291
Why don't you stick to making sweets?

15:47.750 --> 15:51.083
It's not enough to drive.
You've got to become a driver.

15:51.916 --> 15:54.625
Anyone tries to overtake you, do this…

15:54.708 --> 15:56.541
Out of the way, sister-fucker!

15:57.791 --> 15:58.916
Outta my way, fucker!

16:01.291 --> 16:02.708
The road is a jungle.

16:03.375 --> 16:06.958
A good driver must roar
to get ahead on it!

16:25.125 --> 16:26.666
-Yeah?
-Namaste, sir.

16:26.750 --> 16:27.916
What do you want?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.541
Any need of a driver, sir?

16:29.625 --> 16:32.375
I've got four years' experience.
My master recently died, so I--

16:32.458 --> 16:34.333
Get lost. We have a driver already.

16:34.416 --> 16:37.416
I see you have two cars, sir,
but do you have two drivers?

16:37.500 --> 16:40.458
What's wrong with you?
Get lost, motherfucker.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.458
Sir? This is your house?

16:45.458 --> 16:46.958
-Laxmangarh?
-Yes, sir!

16:47.041 --> 16:49.791
The gods must be watching over us!

16:55.375 --> 16:57.250
Let the boy in.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.083
-But, sir--
-Let him in.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.541
I can't believe it's you, sir.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.333
How the crops died since you left.

17:10.416 --> 17:11.791
And we prayed that…

17:14.833 --> 17:15.916
Get up.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.250
Of course, sir.

17:39.791 --> 17:40.625
No, sir.

17:49.333 --> 17:50.375
Yes, sir.

17:53.625 --> 17:54.541
He drives well.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.958
-What's your caste?
-Halwai, sir.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.666
Is that a high caste or low?

18:16.041 --> 18:17.458
Low caste, sir.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.375
All our servants are high caste.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.791
-You drink?
-No, sir.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.458
Steal?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.125
Halwai?

18:30.208 --> 18:31.791
-You're a sweet maker?
-Yes, sir.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.416
Whatever you like, sir.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.458
-How much you want?
-I don't want any money, sir.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.583
No, sir, that's too much.

19:09.083 --> 19:09.958
Yes, sir.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.208
Bro, you wanna climb in here?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.583
-Get moving!
-Watch how you drive!

19:19.791 --> 19:20.958
Should we get the rod?

19:21.041 --> 19:22.791
Let's get the rod.

19:22.875 --> 19:27.166
I know you're play-acting.
You haven't been hired yet, hick!

20:36.791 --> 20:38.000
This is the room.

20:38.666 --> 20:39.875
This is my room?

20:39.958 --> 20:42.208
You'll share it with me.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.666
I'll find a mattress
from the store for you.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.291
No, there's no need for that.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.458
I'll be quite comfortable on the floor.
Nothing to worry about.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.291
There's even a first class roof!

20:52.458 --> 20:55.250
Here. You're to wear this at all times.

20:55.916 --> 20:57.083
-It's mine?
-Yes.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.541
-Hey, hero!
-Yes, sir?

21:14.583 --> 21:16.166
I hope you like carpets.

21:16.250 --> 21:19.208
When you're done cleaning those,
wash all the windows.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.500
Got it?

21:20.583 --> 21:22.083
But I'm the driver, sir.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.791
No. You're the "number two" driver.

22:23.458 --> 22:25.583
Sir, why is Ram Persad not eating?

22:25.666 --> 22:28.875
-And his mouth stinks these days.
-You keep your mouth shut.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.916
Very good. A little higher. Yeah, there.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.041
-Know what that was for?
-Yes, sir.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.625
They respect us for that. Remember that.

25:54.708 --> 25:57.083
Hey, a little higher.

26:38.291 --> 26:41.208
Count it. I don't want to hear shit later.

26:44.666 --> 26:45.625
Good, sir!

26:49.166 --> 26:52.666
And they're not from the same caste.
She's a Christian.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.041
-And he married her?
-Yeah.

26:55.125 --> 26:56.750
That's normal in America.

26:57.500 --> 27:01.416
Her people were against it too,
but he wouldn't listen.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.000
-Is she American?
-No, no, she's Indian.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.250
She was born here.
She moved there when she was 12.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.750
She told me.

27:09.833 --> 27:11.291
She talks to you?

27:11.375 --> 27:12.625
Talks to me?

27:12.708 --> 27:15.125
She tells me everything.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.166
I'm their number one driver.

27:17.250 --> 27:18.833
Are you serious?

27:21.250 --> 27:22.416
Can I also come inside?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.416
-It's not allowed.
-Why?

27:24.916 --> 27:28.125
What do you mean, "why"?
If Mukesh sees, he'll scold me.

27:30.375 --> 27:31.875
-Take care.
-Yes, you too.

28:46.250 --> 28:49.416
As long as there is a sun and a moon,
madam's name will remain!

28:49.500 --> 28:51.416
Long live the madam!

28:51.500 --> 28:53.166
Long live socialism!

29:23.375 --> 29:25.000
Two million rupees is a little too much.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.041
Son! Come here.

29:31.916 --> 29:34.541
-Son! Come here, son.
-Come here, fucker!

29:39.291 --> 29:42.291
Your rich employers
are trying to bugger me.

29:42.958 --> 29:45.625
-What do you say to that?
-Driver, get lost.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.583
Shut up, mother-fucker!

29:50.916 --> 29:52.041
2.5 million rupees.

29:57.041 --> 30:00.916
Otherwise, back to Laxmangarh,
where I first found you hicks!

30:03.750 --> 30:05.750
Why pay this small-time sister-fucker?

30:05.833 --> 30:09.833
Let's go straight to Delhi
and pay off the opposing party.

30:09.916 --> 30:12.125
She's going to lose the next election.

30:16.083 --> 30:19.583
Stay here and learn the family business.
Let me and Mukesh handle this.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.250
-What are you doing?
-Oh, here you are!

31:13.333 --> 31:15.625
Actually, I gotta drive
Ashok Sir to Delhi.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.875
I gotta make the Pajero look perfect.

31:17.958 --> 31:20.333
You're mistaken. I'm taking them to Delhi.

31:20.416 --> 31:23.416
Really? To visit all the mosques there?

31:25.250 --> 31:26.916
Get away from that.

31:33.416 --> 31:35.250
I don't think Mukesh Sir wants to give

31:35.333 --> 31:39.833
Mohammad Mohammad,
or whatever your name is…

31:39.916 --> 31:43.750
a raise of 3,000 rupees.

31:45.833 --> 31:48.708
I've been their driver for 20 years.

31:48.791 --> 31:51.000
Mr. Ashok is like my own son.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.416
I drove him to school when he was a boy.

31:55.041 --> 31:56.333
That's a good point.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.125
But only Allah knows what corrupt ideas
you put into my poor master's mind.

32:01.208 --> 32:03.458
Please, sir, I have a family.

32:05.458 --> 32:06.666
Don't we all.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.750
I'm going to Delhi
in an air-conditioned car!

34:54.666 --> 34:57.875
The thing to know about Delhi is
the roads are smooth,

34:57.958 --> 35:01.583
the people are bad,
and the police are rotten.

35:02.375 --> 35:05.375
The masters' clothes
get washed here and sent back up.

35:05.458 --> 35:06.333
Toilets are here.

35:06.416 --> 35:09.291
This phone rings when your boss wants you.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.958
There's even a temple if you wanna pray.

35:13.250 --> 35:16.208
And here is our den of pleasures.

35:16.291 --> 35:19.625
When we have money, we play cards here.

35:26.041 --> 35:29.000
All the crazy fun happens here! Come!

35:33.083 --> 35:35.916
If you're not careful,
the mosquitos will eat you alive.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.625
If they carry malaria,
you'll be sick as a dog for weeks.

35:39.708 --> 35:42.041
But if it's a dengue mosquito…

35:42.125 --> 35:44.791
I swear on my mother,
you'll shiver all over.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.500
And you'll die for sure.

35:46.583 --> 35:48.666
-Die from a mosquito?
-Definitely.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.541
This is your room.

35:52.833 --> 35:55.166
Nice. But who am I sharing it with?

35:55.250 --> 35:57.583
-You plan on bringing your family?
-No.

35:57.666 --> 36:00.166
-You have plans to do some fucking?
-No.

36:00.250 --> 36:03.208
-How's your little guy?
-Who's this homo pussy?

36:03.291 --> 36:04.291
Get going.

36:04.375 --> 36:05.916
-Check his bag.
-I'm looking.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.250
-Come on, get!
-Bro, let us have a look.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.500
This asshole's uniform's nicer than yours.

36:10.583 --> 36:13.583
-I can tell by his bag he's useless.
-So, Country Mouse…

36:13.666 --> 36:15.416
How much they paying you?

36:15.500 --> 36:17.708
Enough. I'm happy.

36:19.208 --> 36:21.125
You're a sweet, loyal dog, eh?

36:26.041 --> 36:27.791
If your boss wants anything…

36:27.875 --> 36:29.166
I have it all.

36:29.750 --> 36:30.708
Foreign wines…

36:30.791 --> 36:34.000
Golf balls. Girls.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.583
BALRAM

38:00.791 --> 38:03.083
To the President's House. Move it!

38:16.125 --> 38:18.500
Oy! That was our exit, idiot!

39:30.375 --> 39:31.666
Just a little bit.

39:32.541 --> 39:33.958
Mix it all up, please.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.833
Here you are, sir.
I removed all the potatoes.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.708
Good memory, boy!

39:52.250 --> 39:53.208
Yes, sir.

39:59.083 --> 40:00.750
What're you laughing at?

40:05.375 --> 40:06.833
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

40:12.791 --> 40:14.833
He'll sit on your head and fuck your ear.

40:44.791 --> 40:45.833
Yes, sir.

40:49.875 --> 40:50.750
No, no!

40:52.333 --> 40:53.583
No, sir, of course not.

42:16.458 --> 42:19.375
This is great for when you're lonely,
or upset with your boss.

42:19.458 --> 42:24.625
This has revenge, rape, murder, sex.
It's got everything.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.583
You can really enjoy yourself.

42:26.666 --> 42:28.000
You can even jerk off.

42:33.166 --> 42:35.458
Red bra, big boobs…

42:36.375 --> 42:38.625
Country Mouse, you like that?

42:38.708 --> 42:41.000
Big tits, huge asses!

42:41.083 --> 42:44.000
Hold them like mangos
and nibble with your teeth.

42:44.083 --> 42:47.541
-And suck 'em right up!
-What's he talking about?

42:47.625 --> 42:51.250
But don't let your little mouse
get sucked up in their dark caves!

42:51.333 --> 42:52.791
Want me to put in a good word?

42:52.875 --> 42:58.125
I noticed how ladies in the city
don't have hair on their legs or armpits!

42:58.208 --> 42:59.041
What?

43:01.208 --> 43:05.000
Does your mom have hair here?
And here and here too?

43:05.083 --> 43:07.708
Are all the women in your village hairy?

43:07.791 --> 43:10.208
The whole family hang like monkeys and--

43:10.291 --> 43:12.416
Why talk about mothers and sisters?

43:16.708 --> 43:18.000
Dude, we're just kidding.

43:18.083 --> 43:20.041
Do I talk about your mothers and sisters?

43:20.125 --> 43:21.375
-Come on!
-Hey! Come back.

43:27.458 --> 43:29.666
You fuckers hide cards in your asses.

43:32.458 --> 43:35.833
Country Mouse!
Where are you going? Off to die?

43:36.333 --> 43:38.541
-Hey, fucker!
-You're a faggot.

43:42.291 --> 43:46.083
Uncle, is there a room
for someone to stay alone?

43:47.750 --> 43:48.833
There's one there.

43:48.916 --> 43:50.583
But who wants to live alone?

46:46.375 --> 46:48.333
Hi, uncle, how are you all doing?

46:52.125 --> 46:53.583
How's it going, brother?

46:54.333 --> 46:56.083
Now he remembers his family.

46:56.166 --> 46:58.625
You haven't sent money home
since you went to Delhi.

46:58.708 --> 47:02.250
Forgive me, brother. I'm here now.

47:06.625 --> 47:09.583
My grandson is a very big man!

47:10.208 --> 47:15.083
But he forces his Granny
to do all his work for him.

47:15.166 --> 47:19.541
This is the fate
of an old woman in this world.

47:29.125 --> 47:31.166
Eat the chicken.

47:31.250 --> 47:33.791
I made it myself.

47:34.333 --> 47:36.833
You haven't had any like it in ages.

47:38.333 --> 47:39.875
Ashok Sir is a vegetarian.

47:40.708 --> 47:44.291
America made him completely lose his mind.

47:44.375 --> 47:46.208
I'm thinking of doing the same.

47:46.291 --> 47:48.083
What? Are you a Brahmin?

47:48.166 --> 47:50.416
Eat. You've gotten so thin.

47:50.500 --> 47:53.833
A body should be filled out for marriage.

47:55.250 --> 47:57.333
-Whose marriage?
-Yours!

47:57.416 --> 47:59.583
We found a girl for you.

47:59.666 --> 48:03.500
You'll be married by the end of the year.

48:08.208 --> 48:11.125
I need time. I'm not ready to get married.

48:11.208 --> 48:12.500
Not ready?

48:13.083 --> 48:14.625
Just eat the chicken.

48:14.708 --> 48:16.375
I don't want to get married.

48:16.458 --> 48:22.500
Stop thinking of yourself
and start thinking of the family.

48:24.541 --> 48:25.458
Eat.

48:26.750 --> 48:29.916
-You're not Ashok Sir.
-Did you not understand?

48:30.000 --> 48:32.750
Are you going to force me?
I don't want to get married!

48:32.833 --> 48:34.708
You're driving me insane.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.416
Where are you going? Stop!

48:41.333 --> 48:42.333
What happened?

48:43.375 --> 48:45.583
-You must keep sending money.
-I won't send it.

48:45.666 --> 48:46.958
That's the family's money!

48:47.958 --> 48:51.541
She's sucked the blood out of you
and left you a shell.

48:51.625 --> 48:53.875
And she'll leave you to die, like Dad.

50:49.375 --> 50:50.875
What's he doing?

50:59.291 --> 51:00.833
-Bring another cup.
-Yes, madam.

51:00.916 --> 51:02.250
After you wash your hands.

53:02.041 --> 53:04.416
-Is this toothpaste, uncle?
-Yes, it's terrific.

53:04.500 --> 53:06.625
It'll make your teeth totally white.

53:06.708 --> 53:09.541
-Where can I find something for an itch?
-The medicine shop.

53:09.625 --> 53:11.041
Five hundred!

53:11.125 --> 53:13.375
-Are these for the office?
-Yep, take a look.

53:13.458 --> 53:17.083
Those are 200.
This is leather, better quality.

53:19.166 --> 53:21.583
100 rupee sale!

53:21.666 --> 53:26.541
-How much?
-100 rupees sale!

53:26.625 --> 53:27.708
Pick any one.

53:27.791 --> 53:32.000
And 250 for the pant.
It's a good designer pant.

55:05.791 --> 55:06.791
Country Mouse!

55:08.458 --> 55:10.958
Don't stand there alone.
Come hang with us.

55:11.041 --> 55:13.291
Standing alone leads to bad thoughts.

55:13.375 --> 55:16.708
Look at him!
Dressed like the maharaja of England!

55:17.708 --> 55:19.291
Hope you haven't peed your pants.

55:19.375 --> 55:21.208
Someone get him a diaper.

55:23.125 --> 55:25.291
-Asshole!
-I'll lube you up…

55:26.458 --> 55:27.958
How's your room?

55:28.041 --> 55:31.166
Are there cockroaches in there?

56:05.833 --> 56:07.541
I dozed off.

57:33.916 --> 57:36.125
Take it, madam. Only 100 rupees.

57:36.208 --> 57:37.666
I'm very hungry.

57:37.750 --> 57:38.875
Can I see?

57:40.666 --> 57:43.791
Please, madam. Take three for 200.

57:43.875 --> 57:46.541
-I'm hungry.
-Don't touch the car.

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:20.041
Balram, come in. Come, come.

1:04:25.250 --> 1:04:27.083
-Greetings, sir!
-Come in.

1:04:27.833 --> 1:04:29.625
-Have a seat.
-Sit up.

1:04:29.708 --> 1:04:31.750
On the sofa. Make yourself comfortable.

1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:38.500
Come, sit.

1:04:39.708 --> 1:04:41.541
-All good?
-Great, sir.

1:04:45.875 --> 1:04:48.208
No, sir. I washed the car and went to bed.

1:04:48.708 --> 1:04:49.541
Good.

1:04:52.291 --> 1:04:53.458
Yes, sir.

1:04:53.541 --> 1:04:56.500
-Would you like some paan?
-No, sir, I quit paan.

1:04:56.583 --> 1:05:00.791
-Come on! You still eat paan, I know it!
-No, really, sir! Ashok Sir, tell them.

1:05:00.875 --> 1:05:02.625
-I know you eat paan.
-Come on, sir.

1:05:09.583 --> 1:05:11.166
-Is it all right?
-It's very good!

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:19.250
-Right, Balram?
-Yes, sir.

1:05:26.375 --> 1:05:27.875
I got some paan on it.

1:05:51.083 --> 1:05:52.250
I don't understand, sir.

1:05:52.333 --> 1:05:54.875
We'll explain it to you afterwards.
Keep reading.

1:07:22.791 --> 1:07:25.875
Go ahead and sign it, brother. Right here.

1:07:37.875 --> 1:07:40.041
Aren't you my brother? My younger brother?

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:40.958
Yes, sir.

1:07:41.041 --> 1:07:42.750
We eat and hang out together.

1:07:42.833 --> 1:07:45.791
Dad's here, I'm here.
Brother Ashok is right there.

1:07:46.750 --> 1:07:49.541
-Is there anything to worry about?
-No, sir.

1:07:55.250 --> 1:07:56.250
Go on.

1:08:01.291 --> 1:08:04.333
-All right? Go on.
-Go on.

1:08:05.250 --> 1:08:06.291
All right, sir.

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:12.666
No need for that.

1:10:30.166 --> 1:10:31.708
Give me Moonlight Whiskey.

1:11:33.750 --> 1:11:34.791
Here you are!

1:11:35.458 --> 1:11:38.500
Your boss
has been calling like crazy for you.

1:11:38.583 --> 1:11:40.666
He came down here last night too.

1:11:42.583 --> 1:11:43.583
Are you sick?

1:11:44.416 --> 1:11:45.416
Typhoid?

1:11:46.125 --> 1:11:48.166
Dengue? Malaria?

1:11:50.416 --> 1:11:53.416
You seem to be in some big trouble.

1:12:03.833 --> 1:12:05.208
Oy, jackass dick.

1:12:05.291 --> 1:12:07.708
How many times do I have to call for you?

1:12:07.791 --> 1:12:11.000
What're you staring at?
Get the bottle of oil, useless fucker.

1:12:24.291 --> 1:12:26.000
This match looks fixed.

1:12:26.083 --> 1:12:28.500
The cricketers are taking shit out there.

1:12:34.333 --> 1:12:35.333
You're back?

1:12:36.041 --> 1:12:37.333
Come, sit down.

1:12:39.625 --> 1:12:40.666
See for yourself.

1:13:25.666 --> 1:13:28.666
There, there. Enough of your drama.
Massage my feet!

1:13:30.791 --> 1:13:32.250
He's fucking lazy!

1:13:54.208 --> 1:13:57.000
She's looking for the victim's family,
to compensate them.

1:13:57.083 --> 1:13:59.208
-What are we, murderers?
-She won't do that.

1:13:59.291 --> 1:14:01.083
Dude, shut up.

1:14:01.166 --> 1:14:03.625
She's gone crazy. Rein her in!

1:14:17.083 --> 1:14:20.458
I have your confession
and will always have it.

1:15:28.208 --> 1:15:29.250
Hey, brother.

1:15:29.333 --> 1:15:32.833
-Can you give me something to eat?
-Move along.

1:15:32.916 --> 1:15:36.250
-I haven't eaten anything in days.
-I don't have anything, move along.

1:15:36.333 --> 1:15:38.916
You must have a rupee,
please give it to me, brother.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.625
-Move along.
-Where should I go?

1:15:40.708 --> 1:15:43.250
I told you to move along!
Does your head not work?

1:15:43.333 --> 1:15:46.708
You want this? Should I take
my clothes off and give them to you?

1:15:46.791 --> 1:15:48.041
You want me to get naked?

1:15:48.125 --> 1:15:51.083
-Maybe something to eat…
-This woman is driving me insane!

1:15:51.166 --> 1:15:53.083
Give me something to eat…

1:15:53.166 --> 1:15:56.166
I've earned 36 rupees in six months.
Shall I give it all to you?

1:15:56.250 --> 1:15:57.750
Then what should I eat?

1:15:57.833 --> 1:16:00.041
Give me some food, my child.

1:16:00.125 --> 1:16:04.750
This woman has gone crazy!
Get her out of here. She's lost her mind.

1:16:05.875 --> 1:16:07.708
Arrest her! You are the police!

1:23:13.291 --> 1:23:16.375
Once you have the food here, sir,
you'll never forget it.

1:25:12.666 --> 1:25:13.708
Go get the car.

1:25:59.333 --> 1:26:01.458
Look what I brought for you, sir.

1:26:02.041 --> 1:26:03.208
Nice and hot okra.

1:26:07.166 --> 1:26:09.125
Nice and crispy, check it out.

1:26:11.250 --> 1:26:13.166
Don't say that. Have a little bit.

1:26:18.541 --> 1:26:20.958
He doesn't feel like it.
Why're you up in his ass?

1:26:21.041 --> 1:26:22.458
Get rid of it, sister-fucker!

1:26:24.833 --> 1:26:28.208
Until Ashok Sir calls you,
don't hover like a fly!

1:26:28.291 --> 1:26:29.291
Yes, sir.

1:27:05.083 --> 1:27:06.208
No, no, no.

1:27:38.375 --> 1:27:42.000
Have you ever thought about
what happens to you in the future?

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:43.791
Eyes.

1:27:44.291 --> 1:27:47.083
As long as you have eyes, you'll work.

1:27:47.166 --> 1:27:50.541
But when you turn 50-55,
they'll kick your ass out.

1:27:51.291 --> 1:27:52.291
And then?

1:27:52.375 --> 1:27:55.666
If you've saved some money,
you can buy a little shack.

1:27:55.750 --> 1:27:59.708
But if you're clever like me
and earn extra money, then maybe more.

1:28:00.416 --> 1:28:02.208
That's the best case scenario.

1:28:02.291 --> 1:28:05.166
Imagine your boss
kicks you out without any reason.

1:28:05.250 --> 1:28:07.125
Or you get into an accident!

1:28:07.791 --> 1:28:09.208
You'll be dead!

1:28:09.291 --> 1:28:10.583
Or homeless.

1:28:17.291 --> 1:28:18.500
Hey, Country Mouse…

1:28:20.541 --> 1:28:21.791
Everything's fine?

1:28:21.875 --> 1:28:22.958
First class.

1:28:24.708 --> 1:28:28.500
I hate to tell you this,
but all the drivers are talking about you.

1:28:28.583 --> 1:28:31.541
That you sit in your boss' car alone…

1:28:32.125 --> 1:28:34.000
muttering away to yourself.

1:28:36.125 --> 1:28:37.125
Is it true?

1:29:57.250 --> 1:29:59.750
Ashok Sir, I'll fuck your mother.

1:30:01.041 --> 1:30:03.375
I'm trying to drive.
I can't pay attention like this.

1:30:03.458 --> 1:30:04.500
Take this.

1:30:05.583 --> 1:30:06.625
Take it!

1:30:06.708 --> 1:30:09.875
You're a eunuch, you motherfucker!
A eunuch!

1:30:29.583 --> 1:30:31.916
I made an offering of
101 rupees in your name.

1:31:14.583 --> 1:31:17.708
But I'm fucking Indian at heart,
after all.

1:31:17.791 --> 1:31:18.916
Absolutely, sir.

1:31:58.791 --> 1:32:00.791
Incredible! Incredible, sir!

1:32:01.666 --> 1:32:03.708
Very good, sir! That was great fun!

1:32:10.291 --> 1:32:12.708
I also dabble in singing, sir.

1:32:18.166 --> 1:32:20.166
All right, sir. I'll sing a little bit.

1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:22.333
My Granny taught me.

1:32:27.708 --> 1:32:33.541
O Murari, what can be said of you?

1:32:34.125 --> 1:32:35.833
Said of you…

1:32:36.583 --> 1:32:42.208
O Murari, what can be said of you?

1:32:42.291 --> 1:32:43.541
Said of you…

1:32:44.291 --> 1:32:49.625
In this world of yours
I don't want to live

1:32:49.708 --> 1:32:51.625
To live!

1:32:51.708 --> 1:32:55.708
In this world of yours
I don't want…

1:32:55.791 --> 1:32:58.250
To live!

1:33:03.916 --> 1:33:05.708
Yes, sir, absolutely, sir.

1:34:13.375 --> 1:34:15.625
What the fuck was that?

1:34:19.791 --> 1:34:21.250
Turn off the radio, asshole!

1:34:21.333 --> 1:34:23.750
This sister-fucker
thinks he's doing charity.

1:34:24.958 --> 1:34:26.583
Is that your father's money, dickhead?

1:36:20.916 --> 1:36:21.750
Dad?

1:36:23.958 --> 1:36:27.375
Even if you were to steal it…
it wouldn't be stealing.

1:36:27.458 --> 1:36:31.375
Mr. Ashok bribes politicians
in order not to pay taxes.

1:36:31.458 --> 1:36:33.041
So who is he stealing from?

1:36:33.125 --> 1:36:35.166
The ordinary people of this country.

1:36:36.750 --> 1:36:37.666
Me.

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000
And you.

1:41:00.666 --> 1:41:02.375
Turn that shit off, asshole!

1:41:16.083 --> 1:41:18.583
Drive, sister-fucker!
Why'd you come this way?

1:41:22.041 --> 1:41:24.750
Long live socialism!

1:41:43.083 --> 1:41:46.666
We would like
to show our appreciation by donating

1:41:46.750 --> 1:41:49.250
one million rupees to your party.

1:41:54.750 --> 1:41:57.583
Is that how much you paid
the opposition party, fucker?

1:41:58.833 --> 1:42:02.416
We want four million rupees.
Monday night, Sheraton Hotel.

1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:03.541
Got it?

1:42:36.791 --> 1:42:40.666
I took a bus from the village,
then caught a train…

1:42:42.041 --> 1:42:44.583
and got here after
asking around about you.

1:42:45.333 --> 1:42:51.250
Granny said you would look after me
and help me become a driver.

1:42:55.208 --> 1:42:56.666
-Who are you?
-Dharam.

1:42:57.416 --> 1:42:59.041
Aunt Lattu's fourth son.

1:43:00.791 --> 1:43:02.500
-What's in your hand?
-A letter.

1:43:02.583 --> 1:43:05.208
A letter? Show it to me.

1:43:14.875 --> 1:43:20.708
My dear grandson,
it has been seven months and two days…

1:43:20.791 --> 1:43:22.791
since you sent us money.

1:43:22.875 --> 1:43:25.791
The city has corrupted your soul.

1:43:26.333 --> 1:43:31.000
Life has become hard here.
Lord Indra is unhappy.

1:43:31.625 --> 1:43:34.250
You must send us money again.

1:43:36.166 --> 1:43:40.166
I have arranged for your wedding.

1:43:40.250 --> 1:43:46.541
If you don't come here,
we will send the girl to you by bus.

1:43:46.625 --> 1:43:48.750
If you refuse,

1:43:48.833 --> 1:43:52.833
we will write a letter explaining
everything and send it to your master.

1:43:57.333 --> 1:43:59.458
Is she really going to marry me off?

1:57:40.041 --> 1:57:41.375
Do you understand?
