WEBVTT

00:41.958 --> 00:44.500
[Roald] Hmm. Yes.

00:45.458 --> 00:48.750
Well, here we are now
in the hut where I write.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.750
I've been in this hut for 30 years now.

00:53.625 --> 00:55.833
Well, it's important, uh, before I start,

00:55.916 --> 01:00.875
I like to make sure I have everything
around me that I'm going to need. Um…

01:00.958 --> 01:05.083
Cigarettes, of course.
Some coffee, chocolates.

01:06.958 --> 01:10.750
And always make sure
I have a sharp pencil before I start.

01:10.833 --> 01:12.708
[sharpener grinding]

01:12.791 --> 01:16.333
I have six pencils,
and then I like to clean my writing board.

01:18.541 --> 01:19.958
See how many bits of rubber.

01:21.833 --> 01:22.666
There.

01:24.958 --> 01:26.875
And then, finally, one starts.

01:30.125 --> 01:33.708
It's, uh…
usually a few corrections needed.

01:36.458 --> 01:37.291
Yeah.

01:38.916 --> 01:40.916
[mumbling]

01:42.416 --> 01:43.375
It's, um…

01:47.250 --> 01:51.041
Henry Sugar was 41 years old,
unmarried and rich.

01:51.666 --> 01:54.625
He was rich because
he had a rich father who was now dead.

01:54.708 --> 01:58.791
Was unmarried because he was too selfish
to share any of his money with a wife.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.583
He was 6'2" tall,

02:00.666 --> 02:03.291
and not perhaps as handsome
as he thought he was.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.958
He paid a great deal
of attention to his clothes.

02:06.041 --> 02:08.250
He went
to an expensive tailor for his suits,

02:08.333 --> 02:11.666
to a shirtmaker for his shirts,
and to a boot maker for his shoes.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.583
His hairdresser trimmed his hair
once every ten days,

02:14.666 --> 02:17.458
and he always took a manicure
at the same time.

02:17.541 --> 02:19.083
He drove a Ferrari motor car

02:19.166 --> 02:21.666
which cost him about the same
as a country cottage.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.208
[bell tolling distantly]

02:23.291 --> 02:24.583
All his friends were rich

02:24.666 --> 02:27.000
and he had never done
a day's work in his life.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.500
Men like Henry Sugar can be found
drifting like seaweed all over the world.

02:32.583 --> 02:36.291
They're not particularly bad men,
but they're not good men either.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.416
They're simply part of the decoration.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.625
All rich people
of Henry's type, of course,

02:43.708 --> 02:47.875
have one peculiarity in common:
a terrific urge to make themselves richer.

02:48.791 --> 02:51.625
The 10 million is never enough.
Nor is 20 million.

02:51.708 --> 02:54.583
Always they suffer
the insatiable longing for more money

02:54.666 --> 02:58.250
and the terror of waking up one morning
and finding nothing in the bank.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.541
They employ various methods
to increase their fortunes.

03:01.625 --> 03:04.333
Some buy stocks and shares,
watch them go up and down.

03:04.416 --> 03:09.333
Some buy land or art or diamonds.
Some bet on roulette, blackjack, horses.

03:09.416 --> 03:11.416
Some, indeed, bet on anything.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.541
Henry Sugar was one of those,
and not at all above cheating, by the way.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.458
One summer weekend,

03:17.541 --> 03:21.166
Henry drove from London to the countryside
to stay with Sir William W.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.583
The house was magnificent.
So were the grounds.

03:23.666 --> 03:27.166
But when Henry arrived that Saturday,
it was already pelting with rain.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.750
The host and his other guests
whiled away the afternoon playing games,

03:30.833 --> 03:34.708
while Henry glumly stared out at the drops
splashing against the windows.

03:34.791 --> 03:38.041
Henry wandered out of the drawing room
and into the front hall.

03:38.125 --> 03:42.375
He drifted through the house, aimless.
Then finally mooched into the library.

03:45.250 --> 03:48.916
Sir William's father was a book collector,
and the walls of this huge room

03:49.000 --> 03:52.291
were lined with antiquated
leather bound volumes floor-to-ceiling.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.708
Henry wasn't interested.

03:53.791 --> 03:57.166
He only read detective novels
and thrillers. Nothing like that here.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.333
He was about to leave

03:58.416 --> 04:01.500
when his eye was caught and held
by something quite different.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.458
So slim, he never would've noticed it

04:03.541 --> 04:06.541
if it hadn't been sticking out
from the books on either side.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.166
He pulled it from the shelf.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.291
It was nothing more

04:09.375 --> 04:12.166
than a cardboard exercise book,
the kind children use at school.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.708
The cover was dark blue,
with nothing written on it.

04:14.791 --> 04:18.750
On the first page, hand-printed
in black ink, clear and neat, it said:

04:21.666 --> 04:25.416
Strange. Weird. What is this?

04:26.291 --> 04:29.750
He settled himself into an armchair
and started from the beginning.

04:29.833 --> 04:33.708
The following is what Henry read
in the little, blue exercise book.

04:37.958 --> 04:41.916
My name is Z.Z. Chatterjee. Head surgeon
at Lords and Ladies Hospital, Calcutta.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.083
On the morning of 2nd December, 1935,

04:44.166 --> 04:46.291
I was in the doctors' rest room
having a cup of tea.

04:46.375 --> 04:49.916
Three other doctors were present with me.
Doctors Marshall, Mitra, and Macfarlane.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.500
-There was a knock.
-[knocking]

04:51.583 --> 04:52.750
"Come in," I said.

04:54.458 --> 04:57.750
Excuse me, please.
May I ask you gentlemen a favor?

04:57.833 --> 04:59.500
"This is a private room," I said.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.750
I know. I'm sorry to burst in like this,

05:01.833 --> 05:04.791
but I have a most, I think,
interesting thing to show you.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.208
We were pretty annoyed
and didn't say anything.

05:08.208 --> 05:12.375
Gentlemen, I'm a man
who can see without using his eyes.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.666
He was a small man, about 60,

05:14.750 --> 05:18.375
white mustache and a matting of black hair
over the outsides of his ears.

05:18.458 --> 05:21.291
You may bandage my head
with 50 bandages in any way,

05:21.375 --> 05:23.500
and I'll still be able to read you a book.

05:23.583 --> 05:27.166
He seemed perfectly serious.
I felt my curiosity beginning to stir.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.250
Come in, please.

05:35.166 --> 05:38.791
All right. How many fingers
is Dr. Marshall holding up?

05:38.875 --> 05:40.291
-Seven.
-"Once more," I said.

05:40.375 --> 05:41.750
-Nine.
-"Once more," I said.

05:41.833 --> 05:42.833
-Three.
-Once more--

05:42.916 --> 05:44.291
-Three again.
-Once more.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.166
No fingers.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.333
Hmm. What's the trick?

05:49.416 --> 05:53.333
There's no trick. This is a genuine thing
I've managed after years of training.

05:53.416 --> 05:54.708
What sorts of training?

05:54.791 --> 05:57.208
Forgive me, sir,
but that is a private matter.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.291
What can we do for you?

05:59.375 --> 06:02.333
I work in a traveling theater.
We arrived in Calcutta today.

06:02.416 --> 06:05.791
Tonight we give our opening performance
at the Royal Palace Hall.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.375
I am billed on the program as:

06:07.458 --> 06:09.708
Imdad Khan,
the Man Who Sees without His Eyes.

06:09.791 --> 06:11.750
When our company arrives in a new town,

06:11.833 --> 06:13.250
I go to the largest hospital

06:13.333 --> 06:16.791
and ask the doctors to bandage my eyes
in the most thorough fashion.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.125
It is important this job
is done by doctors,

06:19.208 --> 06:21.208
otherwise people may think I'm cheating.

06:21.291 --> 06:24.041
Then I go out into the streets
and do a dangerous thing.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.333
I looked at the others.

06:25.416 --> 06:28.458
Mitra and Macfarlane
had to go back to their patients. Go on.

06:28.541 --> 06:31.541
-But Dr. Marshall said…
-Why not? Let's do the job properly.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.708
Make it absolutely certain
he can't see anything.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.208
You are kind. Please do whatever you wish.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.000
"Before we bandage him," I said,

06:38.083 --> 06:40.250
"fill his eye sockets
with something soft, solid."

06:40.333 --> 06:42.500
-Dough?
-Perfect. Go to the hospital bakery.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.375
I'll take him and seal his eyelids.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.916
I led Imdad down
the long corridor to the surgery.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.250
"Lie down there," I said.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.666
I took a bottle of collodion
from the cupboard.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.916
I'll glue your eyelids shut
with this stuff.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.291
How do I remove it later?

06:54.375 --> 06:57.833
Just dab some alcohol carefully
below the lashes. That'll dissolve it.

06:57.916 --> 07:00.583
Keep your eyes closed
while we wait for it to harden.

07:00.666 --> 07:01.625
Two minutes passed.

07:01.708 --> 07:04.041
"Open your eyes," I said. He couldn't.

07:04.125 --> 07:08.000
I took some of Dr. Marshall's dough
and plastered it over one of Imdad's eyes.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.333
I filled the whole socket

07:09.416 --> 07:12.000
and let the dough
overlap onto the surrounding skin.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.791
I did the same with the other eye.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.500
I pressed the edges down hard.

07:15.583 --> 07:18.416
-"Isn't too uncomfortable?" I asked.
-[Imdad] Not at all. Thank you.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.458
"Do the bandaging," I said to Marshall.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.000
My fingers are too sticky.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.833
Pleasure. We'll just pop these here…

07:24.916 --> 07:28.333
Dr. Marshall laid thick cotton-wool
on Imdad's dough-filled eyes.

07:28.416 --> 07:29.375
It stuck in place.

07:29.458 --> 07:30.416
Sit up please.

07:31.125 --> 07:34.416
Dr. Marshall rolled a three-inch bandage
round the face and head.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.833
Please do leave
my nose free for breathing.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.083
[Dr. Marshall] Of course.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.500
Sorry, it's going to be
a pinch on the tight side.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.416
[Imdad groans softly]

07:44.166 --> 07:45.083
How's that?

07:45.166 --> 07:46.125
"Splendid," I said.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.708
Looked like he suffered
a terrible brain operation.

07:48.791 --> 07:49.666
How does it feel?

07:49.750 --> 07:50.833
[Imdad] It feels very good.

07:50.916 --> 07:53.916
I must compliment you gentlemen
on doing such a thorough job.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.166
Imdad Khan stood up off the bed
and walked straight to the door.

08:04.291 --> 08:07.458
Great Scott! See that?
He put his hand right on the doorknob!

08:07.541 --> 08:08.958
Dr. Marshall stopped grinning.

08:09.541 --> 08:12.583
Imdad was walking normally,
quite briskly along the corridor.

08:12.666 --> 08:16.000
We followed five yards behind him.
Spooky it was to watch this man

08:16.083 --> 08:19.000
with an enormous,
totally bandaged head strolling casually…

08:19.083 --> 08:20.166
"He saw it!" I cried.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.875
"He saw that trolley!
This is unbelievable!"

08:22.958 --> 08:24.333
Dr. Marshall didn't answer.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.166
His whole face was rigid
with shocked disbelief.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.708
Imdad went down the stairs
with no trouble at all.

08:29.791 --> 08:31.208
Didn't even hold the stair-rail.

08:31.291 --> 08:34.166
Several people were coming up.
You can see how they reacted.

08:34.875 --> 08:38.750
At the bottom of the stairs, he turned
and headed out the doors to the street.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.166
Dr. Marshall and I kept close behind him.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.416
Below us, a crowd of 100
barefoot children shouted and surged

08:44.500 --> 08:46.166
towards our white-headed visitor.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.500
He greeted them
with his hands above his head.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.833
He walked to a bicycle,
mounted it, and pedaled a figure-eight.

08:51.916 --> 08:54.708
The barefoot children chased him,
cheering and laughing.

08:54.791 --> 08:57.583
He sped straight out
into the traffic of the busy street

08:57.666 --> 09:00.916
with honking motorcars
whizzing around him in every direction.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.625
He rode superbly.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.708
For a minute, we kept him in sight.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.750
Then he turned a corner and was gone.

09:06.833 --> 09:10.375
-"I can't believe it," Dr. Marshall said.
-I can't believe it.

09:10.458 --> 09:11.958
"I can't either," I said.

09:12.041 --> 09:14.250
I think we just witnessed a miracle.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.875
For the rest of the day,
I was busy with patients.

09:16.958 --> 09:19.541
In the evening,
I went to my flat to change clothes.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.000
I took a long, cool shower.

09:21.083 --> 09:24.500
I drank whiskey-soda on the veranda
with only a towel around my waist.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.416
At ten minutes to 7:00,
I arrived at the Royal Palace Hall.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.000
[Dr. Z.Z.] The show lasted two hours.

09:29.083 --> 09:32.458
To my surprise, I enjoyed it. The juggler,
the snake-charmer, the fire-eater,

09:32.541 --> 09:35.625
the sword-swallower who pushed a rapier
down his throat into his stomach.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.666
Lastly, to a great fanfare of trumpets,

09:37.750 --> 09:40.000
our friend Imdad Khan
came out to do his act.

09:40.083 --> 09:43.041
Members of the audience
were called onstage to blindfold him

09:43.125 --> 09:45.250
before he threw knives around a boy's body

09:45.333 --> 09:47.541
and shot a can off his head
with a revolver.

09:47.625 --> 09:51.458
Then, finally, a metal barrel was fitted
over his already bandaged head.

09:51.541 --> 09:55.291
The boy placed a needle in Imdad's hand
and some cotton thread in the other.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.708
A large magnifying glass
was placed in front of him,

09:57.791 --> 09:59.375
and with no false moves,

09:59.458 --> 10:02.458
he neatly threaded the thread
through the eye of the needle.

10:02.541 --> 10:05.166
-[crowd] Ah!
-[lively music playing]

10:07.208 --> 10:08.208
I was flabbergasted.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.125
Backstage, I found Imdad
sitting quietly on a stool

10:13.208 --> 10:14.625
while he removed his stage makeup.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.416
You're curious, doctor, correct?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.666
"Most curious," I said.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.583
Again, I was struck by the matting
of black hair on the outsides of his ears.

10:21.666 --> 10:23.916
I'd never seen anything like it
on another person.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.458
I have a proposal:
I'm not a writer by profession.

10:26.541 --> 10:28.875
But if you tell me
how you developed this power

10:28.958 --> 10:31.833
of seeing without your eyes,
I'll take it down faithfully.

10:31.916 --> 10:34.833
I'll try to get it published
in the British Medical Journal

10:34.916 --> 10:36.125
or in a famous magazine.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.375
Would that help you?
To become better known?

10:38.458 --> 10:40.416
-It would help me very much.
-Splendid.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.333
I have a shorthand
for taking down medical histories.

10:43.416 --> 10:46.500
I believe I got everything
Imdad said to me, word for word.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.750
I give it to you now
exactly as he spoke it.

10:55.708 --> 10:58.791
I was born in Kashmir State in 1873.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.916
My father was a ticket inspector
on the national railway.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.291
One day, a conjurer came to our school
and gave a performance.

11:05.375 --> 11:06.833
I was spellbound.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.833
Two weeks later, I took all my savings

11:08.916 --> 11:11.375
and ran away
to join a traveling theater company.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.708
That was in 1886. I was 13 years old.

11:14.791 --> 11:15.791
For three years

11:15.875 --> 11:18.500
I traveled with this group
all over the Punjab.

11:18.583 --> 11:21.125
By the end of it,
I was playing top of the bill.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.666
All the time, I was saving money,

11:23.750 --> 11:27.541
which finally added up
to just over 3,000 rupees.

11:27.625 --> 11:30.625
At this moment,
I heard tell of a great, famous yogi

11:30.708 --> 11:32.958
who had acquired
the rare power of levitation.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.666
It was said that when he prayed,

11:34.750 --> 11:38.208
his whole body left the ground
and rose up 18 inches into the air.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.250
At the very least, a terrific effect.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.208
Mustache?

11:44.125 --> 11:46.208
-Oh. I quit the theater company…
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

11:46.291 --> 11:49.375
…and made my way to the small town
on the banks of the Ganges,

11:49.458 --> 11:51.375
where rumor said this yogi was living.

11:51.458 --> 11:53.833
One day,
I overheard a traveler mention a hermit

11:53.916 --> 11:57.583
he had encountered not so very far away,
in the densest jungle, all alone.

11:57.666 --> 12:01.166
That was enough for me.
Um, I dashed out to hire a horse and cart.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.708
As I negotiated with the driver,

12:03.791 --> 12:06.291
a man appeared and said
he was going in the same direction,

12:06.375 --> 12:09.291
and suggested we share the ride
and split the cost.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.166
Well, what truly fantastic luck!

12:12.250 --> 12:13.541
Talking to my companion,

12:13.625 --> 12:16.625
I found that he was a disciple
of the great yogi himself,

12:16.708 --> 12:19.541
and on his way,
at that very moment, to visit his master.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.458
I blurted out,

12:20.541 --> 12:23.416
"This is the man I'm looking for!
Please, may I meet him?"

12:23.500 --> 12:26.291
My companion looked at me long and slow.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.458
"That is impossible," he said.

12:28.541 --> 12:31.750
From this point forward,
he refused to answer my questions.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.416
However, I managed
to learn one small thing:

12:34.500 --> 12:37.625
the time of day
the great yogi commenced his meditation.

12:37.708 --> 12:41.916
My companion signaled to halt the cart,
dismounted, and was gone.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.583
I pretended to drive on.
But just around the corner,

12:44.666 --> 12:46.750
I jumped down
and snuck back along the path.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.083
Already, the man
had disappeared into the jungle.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.750
-[twig snaps]
-I heard a rustling in the undergrowth.

12:51.833 --> 12:54.125
"If that's not him," I thought,
"it's a tiger,

12:54.208 --> 12:56.750
and I'm about to be
pounced upon, thrashed,

12:56.833 --> 12:59.583
and eaten in little, torn morsels
of bloody flesh."

13:00.958 --> 13:02.125
It was him.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.041
-[insects trilling]
-[birds chirping]

13:04.125 --> 13:07.791
There wasn't even a shadow of a trace
of a path where the man was walking.

13:07.875 --> 13:10.000
He was pushing his way
between tall bamboos

13:10.083 --> 13:11.875
and every kind of heavy vegetation.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.833
I crept after him, very quiet,
keeping at least 100 yards behind.

13:15.916 --> 13:18.916
Whenever I lost sight of him,
which was most of the time,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.458
I was able to follow
the sound of his footsteps.

13:21.541 --> 13:24.750
For half an hour, this tense game
of follow-the-leader went on.

13:24.833 --> 13:27.666
Then, suddenly,
I no longer heard the man in front of me.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.375
I stopped and listened.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.583
All at once,
through the thick undergrowth,

13:31.666 --> 13:34.166
I saw a little clearing
and two small huts.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.458
My heart jumped.

13:35.541 --> 13:37.833
There was a water hole
next to the nearest hut

13:37.916 --> 13:39.916
with a prayer mat beside it, and above,

13:40.000 --> 13:44.208
a large baobab tree
with beautiful, thick, leafy branches.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.583
All through
the great noontime heat, I waited.

13:46.666 --> 13:49.500
On through the heavy wet heat
of the afternoon, I waited.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.958
As five o'clock approached,

13:51.041 --> 13:54.416
I quietly climbed up my tree
and hid among the leaves.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.625
Finally, the great yogi
came out of his hut

13:56.708 --> 13:58.541
and sat cross-legged on the mat.

13:58.625 --> 14:01.208
Each movement he made was calm and gentle.

14:01.291 --> 14:03.791
He put his hands
palm downward on his knees

14:03.875 --> 14:06.041
and took a long breath
through his nostrils,

14:06.125 --> 14:09.875
and already I could see
a sort of brightness was melting over him.

14:09.958 --> 14:13.291
For 14 minutes, he remained
perfectly still in this position.

14:13.375 --> 14:17.000
And then, as I watched,
I saw, quite positively,

14:17.083 --> 14:19.166
his body slowly lifting off the ground.

14:20.666 --> 14:24.333
Twelve inches. Fifteen. Eighteen. Twenty.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.166
Two feet above the prayer mat.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.958
Up in the tree, I said to myself,

14:29.041 --> 14:32.125
"There before you
is a man sitting in the air."

14:33.458 --> 14:37.416
Forty-six minutes, by my watch,
his body remained suspended.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.708
And then he slowly descended
back to earth,

14:39.791 --> 14:42.333
until his buttocks
rested again upon the mat.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.916
I climbed down from my tree
and ran straight over.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.291
The great yogi
was washing his hands and feet.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.583
"How long have you been here?"
he said sharply.

14:49.666 --> 14:52.208
Suddenly, he picked up a brick
and threw it at me so hard

14:52.291 --> 14:54.791
it broke in two
as it struck my leg below the knee.

14:54.875 --> 14:57.000
I have the scar still.
I'll show it to you.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.708
This was actually a stroke of luck.

15:01.791 --> 15:04.791
A great yogi isn't meant
to lose his temper and fling bricks.

15:04.875 --> 15:09.250
The old man was humiliated, remorseful,
and deeply disappointed in himself.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.625
He explained that though
he could not take me on as a disciple,

15:12.708 --> 15:15.541
he would, nevertheless,
give me some informal instruction

15:15.625 --> 15:17.708
in order to make amends for attacking me,

15:17.791 --> 15:20.125
an attack I fully deserved, by the way.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.041
This was in 1890.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.041
I was nearly 17 years old.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.250
Now, what was
the great yogi's instruction?

15:28.333 --> 15:29.875
Here it comes.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.458
The mind is a scattered thing.

15:31.541 --> 15:34.541
It concerns itself
with thousands of different items at once.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.250
Things you see around you.
Things you hear and smell.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.208
Things you think about.
Things you try not to think about.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.250
You must learn to concentrate such that

15:42.333 --> 15:45.916
you can visualize at will one item,
one item only, and nothing else.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.958
If you work hard, you may be able
to concentrate your conscious mind

15:49.041 --> 15:50.458
on any one object you select

15:50.541 --> 15:52.458
for around three and one-half minutes.

15:52.541 --> 15:55.625
This will take
about 20 years of diligent, daily effort.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.291
"Twenty years!" I cried.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.083
Twenty years. It may take longer.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.875
That's the usual time,
if you are able to do it at all.

16:01.958 --> 16:03.541
I'll be an old man by then!

16:03.625 --> 16:06.416
The time varies.
Some take ten years, some take 30.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.333
On extremely rare occasions,
a special person comes along

16:09.416 --> 16:12.250
who's able to develop the power
in only one or two years,

16:12.333 --> 16:14.250
but this is one in a billion. Not you.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.625
Is it that difficult
to concentrate the mind--

16:16.708 --> 16:21.166
Almost impossible. Try it and see.
Shut your eyes and think of something.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.291
Think of just one object.
Visualize it. See it before you.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.458
In a few seconds, your mind will wander.

16:26.541 --> 16:29.541
Other thoughts will creep in.
It's a very difficult thing.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.625
Thus spoke the great, wise, old yogi.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.500
[Imdad] And so my exercises began.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.458
Each evening, I sat down,

16:38.541 --> 16:41.916
closed my eyes, and visualized the person
I loved best in the world,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.333
which was my elder brother
who died, age ten, from a blood disease.

16:45.416 --> 16:49.208
I concentrated on his face,
but the instant my mind began to wander,

16:49.291 --> 16:52.166
I stopped the exercise,
rested for several minutes,

16:52.250 --> 16:53.458
then I tried again.

16:53.541 --> 16:55.291
After five years of daily practice,

16:55.375 --> 16:58.208
I was able to concentrate
absolutely on my brother's face

16:58.291 --> 16:59.750
for one and a half minutes.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.166
I was making progress.

17:04.791 --> 17:05.625
In the meantime,

17:05.708 --> 17:08.833
I began to earn quite good money
giving conjuring performances.

17:08.916 --> 17:11.041
By nature,
my sleight of hand is very good,

17:11.125 --> 17:13.708
but always, I continued my exercises.

17:13.791 --> 17:17.583
Every evening, wherever I was,
I settled myself down in a quiet spot

17:17.666 --> 17:20.333
and concentrated my mind
on my brother's face.

17:20.416 --> 17:23.583
Sometimes, I lit a candle
and began by staring at the flame.

17:23.666 --> 17:27.041
A candle flame, as you know,
has three separate parts:

17:27.125 --> 17:29.541
the yellow at the top,
the mauve lower down,

17:29.625 --> 17:30.875
and the black inside.

17:30.958 --> 17:33.833
I placed the candle
16 inches away from my face,

17:33.916 --> 17:35.458
absolutely level with my eyes,

17:35.541 --> 17:38.708
so I didn't have to make
even tiny adjustments of my eye muscles

17:38.791 --> 17:39.916
by looking up or down.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.041
I stared at the black part in the center
until everything around me disappeared.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.458
Then I shut my eyes

17:45.541 --> 17:48.000
and began to concentrate
on my brother's face.

17:48.916 --> 17:53.750
By 1907, when I was 34 years old,
I could concentrate for three minutes

17:53.833 --> 17:56.125
without any wandering
of my mind whatsoever.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.458
It was also at this time
that I became aware of a slight ability,

17:59.541 --> 18:01.291
just a queer, little feeling,

18:01.375 --> 18:04.375
that when I closed my eyes
and looked at something hard,

18:04.458 --> 18:05.750
with fierce intensity,

18:05.833 --> 18:08.541
I could see the outline
of the object I was looking at.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.583
I thought of a thing the yogi had said:

18:10.666 --> 18:14.250
"Certain holy people have been known
to develop so great a concentration

18:14.333 --> 18:17.000
they can see without using their eyes."

18:17.083 --> 18:21.416
Each night after I performed
my exercises with the candle flame,

18:21.500 --> 18:24.333
I drank a cup of coffee,
then I blindfolded myself

18:24.416 --> 18:26.875
and sat in my chair
trying to see without my eyes.

18:26.958 --> 18:29.125
I started with a deck of playing cards.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.333
I studied the backs. I guessed the values.

18:31.416 --> 18:33.583
Immediately, I had a 60% success rate.

18:33.666 --> 18:35.833
Later, I bought maps
and navigational charts

18:35.916 --> 18:37.625
and pinned them up around my room.

18:37.708 --> 18:42.083
I spent hours looking at them blindfolded,
trying to read the small lettering.

18:42.166 --> 18:46.291
Every evening for the next eight years,
I proceeded with this kind of practice.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.000
By 1915,
I could read a book straight through,

18:49.083 --> 18:50.958
cover to cover, blindfolded.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.291
I had it!

18:52.375 --> 18:54.291
At last, I had this power.

18:55.833 --> 18:58.541
As you know,
it became my entire conjuring performance.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.791
Audiences loved it, but no one
believed it to be genuine. Still don't.

19:01.875 --> 19:05.333
Even doctors, like you, who blindfold me
in the most expert fashion,

19:05.416 --> 19:08.375
refuse to believe
anyone can see without his eyes.

19:08.458 --> 19:11.708
They forget there are other ways
of sending an image to the brain.

19:11.791 --> 19:13.208
Imdad Khan fell silent.

19:13.291 --> 19:14.208
He was tired.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.666
"What other ways?" I asked.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.333
Quite honestly, I do not know.

19:21.083 --> 19:23.958
The seeing is done
by another part of the body.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.458
[Dr. Z.Z.] Which part?

19:35.125 --> 19:36.666
That night I didn't go to bed.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.833
This man would have scientists
turning somersaults in the air.

19:39.916 --> 19:41.875
He must be the most valuable man alive.

19:41.958 --> 19:45.625
I had to find out exactly how it was,
biologically, chemically, magically,

19:45.708 --> 19:48.375
an image could be sent to the brain
without using the eyes.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.833
Blind people might be able to see.
Deaf people to hear. Who knows what else?

19:51.916 --> 19:54.541
"This incredible man
must not be ignored," I thought.

19:54.625 --> 19:58.333
I started transcribing with care
everything Imdad had told me that evening.

19:58.416 --> 20:00.416
I wrote for five hours without stopping.

20:03.125 --> 20:06.583
At eight o'clock the next morning,
I finished the most important part:

20:06.666 --> 20:08.041
the pages you've just read.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.958
I didn't see Dr. Marshall
until we met for our tea break.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.291
I told him what I could
in the time we had.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.916
"Back to the theater tonight," I said.
Can't lose him now.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.291
I'll come with you.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.875
At 6:45,
we drove to the Royal Palace Hall.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.458
I parked the car,
and we walked to the theater.

20:22.541 --> 20:24.250
"There's something wrong," I said.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.625
There was no crowd,
and the doors were closed.

20:26.708 --> 20:30.666
The poster for the show was in place,
but someone had printed across it…

20:30.750 --> 20:32.833
"Tonight's performance canceled."

20:33.875 --> 20:37.208
I asked an old gatekeeper
by the locked doors: "What happened?"

20:37.291 --> 20:39.333
-[gatekeeper] Someone died.
-"Who?"

20:39.416 --> 20:40.958
Of course, I already knew.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.583
[gatekeeper] The man who sees
without his eyes.

20:43.666 --> 20:45.208
"How?" I cried.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.708
[gatekeeper] He went to sleep
and never woke up.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.375
These things happen.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.416
We walked slowly back to the car.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.500
I felt an overwhelming sense
of grief and anger.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.583
I should never have allowed him
out of my sight.

21:03.666 --> 21:05.500
I should've given him my bed,
taken care of him.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.000
Imdad Khan was a maker of miracles.

21:07.083 --> 21:11.333
He'd communicated with mysterious forces
far beyond the reach of ordinary people.

21:11.416 --> 21:13.083
Now he was dead.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.833
"That's that," Dr. Marshall said.

21:15.625 --> 21:16.541
That's that.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.500
"Yes," I said.

21:19.833 --> 21:20.750
"That's that."

21:25.625 --> 21:28.083
This is a true and accurate report
of everything

21:28.166 --> 21:30.291
concerning my two meetings
with Imdad Khan.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.625
Well, well, well.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.791
Now that is extremely interesting.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.333
This is a terrific piece of information.

21:42.916 --> 21:44.333
This could change my life.

21:44.416 --> 21:45.666
[rain pattering]

21:48.375 --> 21:49.375
[rain stops]

21:55.375 --> 21:57.375
[electrical buzzing]

22:04.041 --> 22:06.416
The piece of information
Henry was referring to

22:06.500 --> 22:10.333
was that Imdad Khan had trained himself
to read the value of a playing card

22:10.416 --> 22:11.833
from the reverse side,

22:11.916 --> 22:14.541
and, being,
as mentioned, a dishonest gambler,

22:14.625 --> 22:16.000
Henry realized at once,

22:16.083 --> 22:18.083
he could make a fortune.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.375
He went downstairs to the butler's pantry

22:20.458 --> 22:23.125
and asked for a candle,
a candlestick, and a ruler.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.916
He took them to his bedroom,
locked the door,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.041
drew the curtains,
and turned off the lights.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.625
Put the candle on the dressing table.
Pulled up a chair.

22:29.708 --> 22:33.083
He noticed with satisfaction
that his eyes were level with the wick.

22:33.166 --> 22:37.000
Using the ruler, he positioned
his face 16 inches from the candle,

22:37.083 --> 22:38.541
as indicated in the book.

22:38.625 --> 22:42.125
Imdad Khan had visualized
the face of the person he loved best,

22:42.208 --> 22:44.666
which, in his case,
was his deceased brother.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.458
Henry didn't have a brother.

22:47.041 --> 22:49.958
He decided instead
to visualize his own face.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.666
[car engine revving]

22:56.750 --> 22:59.875
As Henry stared into the black area
at the center of the flame,

22:59.958 --> 23:01.583
an extraordinary thing happened.

23:01.666 --> 23:04.791
His mind went absolutely blank,
his brain ceased fidgeting,

23:04.875 --> 23:08.083
and all at once he felt as if
his entire body had become encased,

23:08.166 --> 23:09.000
snug and cozy,

23:09.083 --> 23:11.708
within that little black area
of burning nothingness.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.500
Admittedly, this lasted only 15 seconds.

23:14.583 --> 23:16.791
Then, no matter where,
or what he was doing,

23:16.875 --> 23:20.291
he made a point of practicing
with the candle five times a day.

23:20.375 --> 23:24.041
For the very first time, he threw himself
into something with enthusiasm,

23:24.125 --> 23:26.291
and the progress he made was remarkable.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.166
After six months

23:28.250 --> 23:31.625
he could concentrate absolutely upon
the image of his face for three minutes

23:31.708 --> 23:34.541
without a single outside thought
entering his mind.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.166
"It's me," Henry thought.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.416
"I'm the one-in-a-billion with the ability

23:38.500 --> 23:40.791
to acquire yoga powers
at incredible speed!"

23:40.875 --> 23:44.250
By the end of the first year,
he'd exceeded five and a half minutes.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.375
The time had come.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.541
[wings fluttering]

23:48.708 --> 23:50.291
[distant car horn blaring]

23:50.375 --> 23:52.833
The living room
of Henry's London flat. Midnight.

23:52.916 --> 23:55.083
He shakes with excitement as,
for the first time,

23:55.166 --> 23:57.291
he places a deck of cards
upside down before him

23:57.375 --> 23:59.041
and concentrates on the top card.

23:59.125 --> 24:02.833
All he sees initially is the ordinary
design of thin red lines on the back,

24:02.916 --> 24:05.750
perhaps the most common
playing-card design in the world.

24:05.833 --> 24:09.375
He now shifts his concentration
to the other side of the card.

24:09.458 --> 24:13.500
He focuses with great intensity
upon the invisible underneath of the card.

24:13.583 --> 24:16.416
Thirty seconds elapse.
One, two, three minutes.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.916
Henry doesn't move a muscle.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.500
His now highly-developed concentration
is absolute.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.500
He visualizes the reverse of the card.

24:22.583 --> 24:25.000
No other thought
is permitted to enter his mind.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.375
During the fourth minute,
something starts to happen.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.333
Slowly, magically, but distinctly,

24:29.416 --> 24:33.125
a black blob becomes a spade,
a twisty squiggle becomes a five.

24:33.208 --> 24:34.708
The five of spades.

24:34.791 --> 24:38.083
Fingers quivering,
he picks up the card and turns it over.

24:38.166 --> 24:40.250
[gasps] "I've done it," he says.

24:41.333 --> 24:42.541
Henry becomes a fanatic.

24:42.625 --> 24:45.291
He never leaves his flat
except to buy food and drink.

24:45.375 --> 24:47.250
All day and often far into the night,

24:47.333 --> 24:49.583
he crouches over the cards
with the stopwatch.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.833
-Reducing his time, second by second.
-[cork pops]

24:51.916 --> 24:54.791
In a month, he's at a minute and a half.
Six months, 20 seconds.

24:54.875 --> 24:56.708
Seven more months, ten seconds flat.

24:56.791 --> 24:58.000
His target is five.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.708
Unless he can read through
a card in five seconds,

25:00.791 --> 25:02.875
he won't work the casinos successfully.

25:02.958 --> 25:06.916
Yet the nearer he gets to his target,
the more difficult it becomes to reach it.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.166
Four weeks
to get from ten seconds to nine.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.083
Five more to get from nine to eight.

25:11.166 --> 25:12.791
Hard work no longer bothers him.

25:12.875 --> 25:15.375
He's able to work
12 hours straight, no trouble.

25:15.458 --> 25:17.791
He knows with certainty he'll get there.

25:17.875 --> 25:20.333
The last two seconds
are the hardest, 11 months.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.041
But late one Saturday afternoon…

25:22.125 --> 25:25.916
[watch ticking]

25:29.708 --> 25:33.583
Five seconds. Henry goes through the pack,
timing himself with every card.

25:33.666 --> 25:37.458
Five seconds. Five seconds. Five seconds.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.833
How long has it taken him
to reach this moment?

25:41.666 --> 25:44.666
Three years and three months
of uninterrupted effort.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.625
There were over
100 legitimate casinos in London.

25:48.708 --> 25:52.750
Henry was a member of no less than ten.
Lord's House was his favorite.

25:52.833 --> 25:56.041
It was the finest in the land,
in a magnificent Georgian mansion.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.166
Good evening, Mr. Sugar.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.916
…said the man
whose job it was to never forget a face.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.125
Henry ascended the marvelous staircase
to the cashier's office.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.250
He wrote a check for £10,000.

26:05.333 --> 26:09.416
Well-fed women circled the roulette wheel
like plump hens around a feeding hopper.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.708
Men with crimson faces,
cigars between their lips

26:11.791 --> 26:14.166
counted their chips,
eyes glittering with greed.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.458
[choir vocalizing]

26:15.541 --> 26:17.541
Odd. For the first time in Henry's life,

26:17.625 --> 26:20.583
he looked with distaste upon a room
full of horrible rich people.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.500
He searched for a vacant seat
directly on the dealer's camera left

26:23.583 --> 26:25.166
at any of the blackjack tables.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.250
The dealer took Henry's plaque
and dropped it into a slot.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.458
He was a young-ish man
with black eyes and gray skin.

26:31.541 --> 26:33.791
He never smiled
and only spoke when necessary.

26:33.875 --> 26:36.583
He had slim hands.
There was arithmetic in his fingers.

26:36.666 --> 26:39.875
He picked up a wedge of £25 chips
and placed them in a pile.

26:39.958 --> 26:42.708
He didn't need to count them.
Those nimble fingers were never wrong.

26:42.791 --> 26:44.250
He slid the pile to Henry.

26:44.333 --> 26:45.708
As Henry stacked his chips,

26:45.791 --> 26:47.875
he glanced at the top card
in the dealer's shoe.

26:47.958 --> 26:51.375
In five seconds he read it as a ten.
He pushed out eight chips, £200,

26:51.458 --> 26:53.583
the maximum stake allowed at Lord's House.

26:53.666 --> 26:56.083
He was dealt the ten.
His second card was a nine.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.333
Nineteen all together.

26:57.416 --> 26:58.416
On 19, you stick.

26:58.500 --> 27:02.083
You sit tight and hope the dealer
doesn't get 20 or 21. It's a given.

27:02.166 --> 27:04.708
-When the dealer came to Henry, he said…
-Nineteen.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.333
…and passed to the next player.
"Wait," said Henry.

27:07.416 --> 27:08.958
The dealer came back to Henry.

27:09.041 --> 27:11.333
He raised his eyebrows,
looked with cool eyes.

27:11.416 --> 27:13.583
-You wish to draw to 19?
-…he asked crisply.

27:13.666 --> 27:17.208
There were only two ranks that
wouldn't bust a 19, the ace and the two.

27:17.291 --> 27:21.250
Only an idiot would risk drawing on 19,
especially with £200 on the table.

27:21.333 --> 27:24.375
The back of the next card lay visible.
The dealer hadn't touched it.

27:24.458 --> 27:27.833
"Yes," Henry said. "Another card."
The dealer shrugged and dealt it.

27:27.916 --> 27:31.083
The two of clubs landed in front of Henry
alongside the ten and the nine.

27:31.166 --> 27:32.708
-21.
-…the dealer said evenly.

27:32.791 --> 27:34.750
He glanced up again into Henry's face,

27:34.833 --> 27:37.500
and rested there,
silent, watchful, puzzled.

27:37.583 --> 27:38.583
[crowd murmuring]

27:38.666 --> 27:42.208
Henry had unbalanced him. He'd rarely,
if ever, seen anyone draw on 19.

27:42.291 --> 27:44.500
This fellow had
with a calmness and certainty

27:44.583 --> 27:46.750
that was quite staggering, and he'd won.

27:46.833 --> 27:50.166
Henry caught the dealer's look,
realized he'd made a silly mistake.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.500
He'd attracted attention.
"I beg your pardon."

27:52.583 --> 27:54.000
He must never do that again.

27:54.083 --> 27:57.125
He must be very careful,
even make himself lose occasionally.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.250
The game went on.

27:58.333 --> 28:00.041
Henry's advantage was so enormous,

28:00.125 --> 28:02.583
he had difficulty
keeping his winnings reasonable.

28:02.666 --> 28:04.291
In an hour, he'd won £30,000.

28:04.375 --> 28:05.416
There he stopped.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.916
It could just as easily
have been a million.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.125
Thank you.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.541
Henry was almost certainly capable
of making money

28:11.625 --> 28:14.041
faster than any other person
in the entire world.

28:16.666 --> 28:17.500
Interesting.

28:22.041 --> 28:24.333
Had this been a made-up story
instead of a true one,

28:24.416 --> 28:25.833
it would have been necessary

28:25.916 --> 28:28.583
to invent a surprising
and exciting end for the thing.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.250
Something dramatic and unusual.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.416
For example, Henry could go home
and start counting his money.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.333
While doing this,
he might suddenly begin to feel unwell.

28:36.416 --> 28:37.875
He has a pain in his chest.

28:38.875 --> 28:41.333
He decides to go to bed.
He takes off his clothes.

28:41.416 --> 28:43.250
Walks naked and puts on pajamas.

28:43.333 --> 28:46.458
He passes the full-length mirror
against the wall. He stops.

28:46.541 --> 28:49.541
Automatically, from force of habit,
he starts to concentrate.

28:49.625 --> 28:51.833
All at once, he sees through his own skin.

28:51.916 --> 28:54.250
Like an X-ray, only better.
He sees everything.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.666
Arteries, veins,
the blood pumping through him.

28:56.750 --> 28:59.750
Liver, kidneys, intestines.
He sees his heart beating.

28:59.833 --> 29:01.791
He looks at where the pain is coming from

29:01.875 --> 29:05.833
and sees a dark lump inside the large vein
leading into the heart on the right side.

29:05.916 --> 29:08.916
A blood clot. At first,
the clot appears to be stationary.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.083
Then it moves. The movement's slight.
Only a millimeter or so.

29:12.166 --> 29:14.708
The blood is pumping up behind the clot
and pushing past it,

29:14.791 --> 29:16.083
and the clot moves again.

29:16.166 --> 29:19.166
It jerks forward about half an inch.
Henry watches in terror.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.375
He knows a large clot that's broken free
and is traveling in the vein

29:22.458 --> 29:24.125
will reach the heart.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.666
He is about to die.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.375
Not a bad ending for fiction,
but this isn't fiction.

29:28.458 --> 29:29.416
This story is fact.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.333
The only untrue thing is Henry's name,
which wasn't Henry Sugar.

29:32.416 --> 29:35.750
His name has to be protected.
It still must be protected.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.875
Apart from that, this is a true story,

29:37.958 --> 29:41.000
and because it's a true story,
it must have the true ending.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.583
Here's what actually happened.

29:46.916 --> 29:49.875
Henry walked for an hour.
The evening was cool and pleasant.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.583
The city still wide awake.

29:51.666 --> 29:55.041
He could feel the thick bankroll
in the inside pocket of his jacket.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.500
He patted it gently.

29:56.583 --> 29:58.708
A lot of money for an hour's work.

29:58.791 --> 30:00.583
Yet, he was a puzzled man.

30:00.666 --> 30:04.583
He couldn't understand why he felt
so little excitement about this success.

30:04.666 --> 30:07.333
If this had happened three years ago,
before the yoga,

30:07.416 --> 30:09.041
he'd have gone crazy with excitement,

30:09.125 --> 30:11.666
he'd be rushing off
to a nightclub to celebrate.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.625
But Henry didn't feel excited.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.166
-He felt sad.
-[choir singing]

30:15.250 --> 30:17.916
Every time he made a bet,
he'd been certain to win.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.083
There was no thrill,
no suspense, no danger.

30:21.166 --> 30:24.000
He knew he could travel
around the world making millions.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.750
But was it going to be any fun?

30:25.833 --> 30:28.000
Another thing.
Was it not entirely possible

30:28.083 --> 30:30.166
the process of acquiring yoga powers

30:30.250 --> 30:33.833
had completely and utterly
changed his entire outlook on life?

30:33.916 --> 30:35.041
It was possible.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.458
The next morning,
Henry woke up late, got out of bed,

30:38.541 --> 30:41.166
saw the enormous bundle
lying on his dressing-table,

30:41.250 --> 30:43.208
and didn't want it.

30:43.291 --> 30:45.291
[film projector whirring]

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
-[choir vocalizing]
-[birdsong]

31:07.500 --> 31:08.333
[man 1] Oy?!

31:08.416 --> 31:11.875
Good morning, sir.
That's for you! It's a present.

31:11.958 --> 31:12.791
[man 1] I…

31:14.000 --> 31:14.833
A what?

31:15.625 --> 31:16.958
Put it in your pocket!

31:18.458 --> 31:19.375
[man 1] All right.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.291
[woman 1] What is it?

31:29.375 --> 31:31.041
-[man 2] It's money.
-Keep it!

31:31.125 --> 31:34.750
[passing footsteps]

31:37.583 --> 31:38.416
[man 2] Hey!

31:38.500 --> 31:40.583
[hurried footsteps approaching]

31:41.875 --> 31:42.833
[woman 2] Come on…

31:44.250 --> 31:45.791
[bicycle bell ringing]

31:45.875 --> 31:47.375
[bicycle thuds]

31:47.458 --> 31:49.083
[car horn honking]

31:49.166 --> 31:51.250
[people chattering excitedly]

31:52.666 --> 31:54.875
[people yelling indistinctly]

32:02.666 --> 32:04.958
-[car brakes screech]
-[car doors slam]

32:06.708 --> 32:08.541
[people clamoring violently]

32:10.291 --> 32:11.875
-[brakes screech]
-[car crashes]

32:11.958 --> 32:12.833
[whistle blowing]

32:13.750 --> 32:17.458
[doorbell ringing]

32:17.541 --> 32:19.291
[policeman] The doorbell rang.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.875
-What do you think you're doing?
-Sorry about the crowd.

32:21.958 --> 32:23.208
I was giving away some money.

32:23.291 --> 32:25.750
-You're inciting a riot!
-Just giving away some money.

32:25.833 --> 32:28.000
I won't do it again. They'll soon go away.

32:28.083 --> 32:31.000
The policeman took one hand off his hip,
produced a £50 note.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.333
-A-ha, you got one yourself.
-This is evidence. Where's the money from?

32:34.416 --> 32:37.166
I won it at blackjack.
I had a tremendously lucky night.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.875
Henry named the club
and the policeman wrote it down.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.333
They'll tell you it's true.

32:41.416 --> 32:43.250
The policeman lowered the book.
I don't care.

32:43.333 --> 32:44.958
-Don't you?
-Not whatsoever.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.583
In fact, I believe your story,

32:46.666 --> 32:49.541
but that doesn't excuse
what you did even the tiniest bit.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.958
I didn't do anything illegal, did I?

32:52.791 --> 32:53.708
Illegal?

32:54.458 --> 32:55.583
[shouting] You're an idiot!

32:56.333 --> 32:59.708
If you're lucky enough to win yourself
a big sum of money like that,

32:59.791 --> 33:02.750
and want to give it away,
you don't throw it out of the window.

33:02.833 --> 33:06.958
You give it somewhere it'll do some good.
A hospital for instance, or an orphanage.

33:07.041 --> 33:09.125
There's hospitals and orphanages all over

33:09.208 --> 33:12.375
got hardly enough money
to buy the kids a present for Christmas.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.208
Then comes a spoiled idiot

33:14.291 --> 33:16.666
who's never known
what it's like to be hard up,

33:16.750 --> 33:18.916
and you throw the stuff
out into the street!

33:19.750 --> 33:22.625
The policeman stomped down the stairs
and out of the door.

33:22.708 --> 33:23.625
Henry didn't move.

33:23.708 --> 33:26.375
Those words, and the fury
with which they were spoken,

33:26.458 --> 33:27.750
struck hard and deep.

33:27.833 --> 33:29.375
He was ashamed.

33:29.458 --> 33:30.708
It was an awful feeling.

33:36.916 --> 33:38.000
Then, all at once,

33:38.083 --> 33:41.500
Henry felt a powerful electricity
tingling through his entire body,

33:41.583 --> 33:45.208
and there began to come to him
an idea that was to change everything.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.791
He started pacing up and down,

33:46.875 --> 33:49.916
ticking off the points
that would make his idea possible.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.333
One. I'm going to win
a very large sum of money

33:52.416 --> 33:55.416
each and every day of my life
from this moment forward.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.250
[different voice] Two. I can go to the
same casino only once every six months.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.875
Three. I must never win
too much money in one sitting.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.375
[normally] £50,000 pounds a night,
that's my limit.

34:04.458 --> 34:08.166
[in Texan accent] Four.
£50,000 a night for 365 days a year.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.916
That's £18.25 million.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.166
[normally] Five. Keep moving.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.791
No more than three nights
at a stretch in any city.

34:14.875 --> 34:16.958
London, Monte-Carlo, Cannes, Biarritz,

34:17.041 --> 34:20.083
Deauville, Las Vegas,
Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Nassau.

34:20.166 --> 34:24.416
Six. I'll take the money and establish
hospitals and orphanages around the world.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.791
[in woman's voice] Corny and sentimental
as a dream,

34:26.875 --> 34:29.083
but as a reality,
I think I can make it work.

34:29.166 --> 34:33.208
I don't think it'd be corny at all.
It would be wonderfully stupendous.

34:33.291 --> 34:36.875
[normally] Seven. I need a partner who can
sit behind a desk and receive the money,

34:36.958 --> 34:38.541
then send it where it's needed.

34:38.625 --> 34:41.791
Someone I can deeply,
emphatically, categorically trust forever.

34:41.875 --> 34:45.041
John Winston was Henry's accountant,
and had been his father's too,

34:45.125 --> 34:47.708
and John's father had been
Henry's father's father's accountant.

34:47.791 --> 34:49.708
You could be the richest man on Earth.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.000
I don't want to be
the richest man on Earth.

34:56.583 --> 34:59.250
I can't operate in England.
The taxman'll take it all.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.416
I'll have to move to Switzerland.
But not tomorrow.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.125
I'm not unattached like you
with no responsibilities.

35:04.208 --> 35:07.000
I must talk to my family,
give notice to my partners.

35:07.083 --> 35:09.541
I must sell my house,
find another in Switzerland,

35:09.625 --> 35:11.916
take the kids out of school.
These things take time.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.125
One year later,
Henry had sent just over £120 million

35:15.208 --> 35:16.875
to John Winston in Lausanne.

35:16.958 --> 35:18.958
The money was delivered five days a week

35:19.041 --> 35:21.250
to a Swiss company
called Winston Sugar, LLC.

35:21.333 --> 35:24.250
Nobody except John and Henry
knew where the money came from

35:24.333 --> 35:25.708
or what would happen to it.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.458
The Monday remittance was the biggest

35:27.541 --> 35:30.125
because it included the take
for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,

35:30.208 --> 35:31.333
when the banks were closed.

35:31.416 --> 35:33.041
[Henry] He moved with astonishing speed,

35:33.125 --> 35:35.750
changing his identity
several times in a single week.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.416
Often, the only clue John had
of Henry's whereabouts

35:38.500 --> 35:42.250
was the address of the bank which had
sent the money. It was stupendous.

35:42.333 --> 35:44.708
[choir vocalizing]

35:44.791 --> 35:46.416
[clock ticking]

35:47.833 --> 35:50.250
-[ticking stops]
-[choir continues]

35:59.416 --> 36:01.416
[birds and insects buzzing]

36:02.541 --> 36:05.958
Henry died last year,
age 63, from a pulmonary embolism.

36:06.041 --> 36:09.166
He saw it coming, quite literally,
but was very much at peace.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.833
He'd been following his plan
for just over 20 years.

36:11.916 --> 36:14.458
He'd made £644 million.

36:14.541 --> 36:16.041
He'd left 21 well-established,

36:16.125 --> 36:19.208
well-run children's hospitals
and orphanages around the world,

36:19.291 --> 36:23.333
administered and financed from Lausanne
by John Winston and his staff.

36:23.416 --> 36:24.666
His work was complete.

36:29.125 --> 36:33.166
Now, how do I know all this?
Good question. I'll tell you.

36:33.250 --> 36:36.708
Soon after Henry's death, John Winston
telephoned me from Switzerland.

36:36.833 --> 36:38.208
He introduced himself simply

36:38.291 --> 36:41.750
as the head of a company
calling itself Winston Sugar, LLC,

36:41.833 --> 36:44.000
and asked
if I'd come to Lausanne to see him

36:44.083 --> 36:47.000
with a view to writing
a brief history of the organization.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.250
I don't know how he chose me.

36:49.333 --> 36:52.125
Probably had a list of writers
and stuck a pin in it.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.375
He would pay me well, he said, and added,

36:54.458 --> 36:56.583
"A remarkable man has died recently."

36:56.666 --> 36:58.291
"His name was Henry Sugar."

36:58.375 --> 37:02.125
"I think people ought to know a bit
about what he has done for the world."

37:02.208 --> 37:03.208
In my ignorance,

37:03.291 --> 37:06.000
I asked whether the story
was really interesting enough

37:06.083 --> 37:07.541
to merit being put on paper.

37:07.625 --> 37:11.041
This annoyed John Winston very much.
Perhaps it even offended him.

37:11.625 --> 37:13.083
In five minutes on the phone,

37:13.166 --> 37:16.041
he told me
about Henry Sugar's secret career.

37:16.125 --> 37:17.541
It was secret no longer.

37:17.625 --> 37:21.083
Henry was dead and would never
enter another casino again.

37:21.166 --> 37:23.083
"I'm coming," I said.

37:23.166 --> 37:26.000
In Lausanne,
I met John Winston, now over 70,

37:26.083 --> 37:27.291
also Max Engelman,

37:27.375 --> 37:30.291
a renowned make-up artist
who traveled the world with Henry

37:30.375 --> 37:33.166
creating fantastic disguises
to conceal his identity.

37:33.250 --> 37:37.333
They were both shattered by Henry's death.
Max even more so than John Winston.

37:37.416 --> 37:39.625
I loved him. He was a great man.

37:39.708 --> 37:42.666
John Winston showed me
the original dark-blue exercise book

37:42.750 --> 37:45.666
written by Z.Z. Chatterjee
in Calcutta in 1935.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.833
I later copied it out word-for-word.

37:47.916 --> 37:49.375
"One last question," I said.

37:49.458 --> 37:52.958
"You keep calling him Henry Sugar,
yet you tell me that wasn't his name."

37:53.041 --> 37:56.250
"Don't you want me to say
who he really was when I do the story?"

37:56.333 --> 37:57.750
-No.
-…John Winston said.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.208
Max and I promised
never to reveal his identity.

38:00.291 --> 38:02.750
Oh, I suppose
it'll probably leak out sooner or later.

38:02.833 --> 38:04.833
He was from a well-known English family,

38:04.916 --> 38:07.500
but I'd appreciate it
if you didn't try to find out.

38:07.583 --> 38:09.791
Just please,
call him plain Mr. Henry Sugar.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.291
And that is what I have done.

38:42.291 --> 38:45.208
Ernie had been given a rifle
for his birthday.

38:45.291 --> 38:48.875
He took the gun and a box of bullets
and went to see what he could kill.

38:48.958 --> 38:50.166
Outside Raymond's house,

38:50.250 --> 38:53.000
he stuck two fingers in his mouth
and gave a long shrill whistle.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.166
[whistles]

38:54.250 --> 38:57.125
Raymond was Ernie's best friend.
He lived four doors away.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.250
He held up the rifle over his head.

38:59.333 --> 39:02.166
"Gripes!" said Raymond.
"We can have some fun with that!"

39:03.125 --> 39:06.333
The two boys set off.
This was a Saturday morning in May.

39:06.416 --> 39:08.416
The chestnut trees were in full flower,

39:08.500 --> 39:10.916
and the hawthorn was white
along the hedgerows.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.833
As Ernie and Raymond
progressed up the narrow hedgy lane,

39:13.916 --> 39:15.916
they shot every little bird they saw.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.833
Bullfinches, hedge sparrows,
whitethroats, yellowhammers.

39:18.916 --> 39:21.958
When they reached the railway line,
there were 14 small birds

39:22.041 --> 39:23.541
dangling on a line of string.

39:24.375 --> 39:27.541
"Look!" whispered Ernie,
pointing with a long arm. "Over there!"

39:27.625 --> 39:29.458
There was a small boy looking up

39:29.541 --> 39:32.125
into the branches of an old tree
through binoculars.

39:32.250 --> 39:33.791
"Watson! That little twerp."

39:35.291 --> 39:37.166
Peter Watson had a small, frail body.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.208
His face was freckled
and he wore spectacles with thick lenses.

39:40.291 --> 39:41.541
He was a brilliant pupil,

39:41.625 --> 39:44.416
already in senior class at school
though he was only 13.

39:44.500 --> 39:47.250
He loved music and played the piano well.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.875
He was no good at games.
He was quiet and polite.

39:51.750 --> 39:55.000
The two bigger boys
crept up slowly on the small boy.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.541
He did not see them
because he had the binoculars to his eyes

39:59.625 --> 40:02.208
and was deeply captivated
by what he was looking at.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.541
"Stick 'em up!"
Ernie shouted, pointing the gun.

40:05.625 --> 40:07.250
Peter Watson jumped.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.166
[bird calling]

40:09.250 --> 40:11.916
He stared through his spectacles
at the two intruders.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.208
"Go on!" Ernie shouted. "Stick 'em up!"

40:14.291 --> 40:15.583
Peter Watson stood still,

40:15.708 --> 40:18.416
holding the binoculars
in front of him with both hands.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.250
He looked at Raymond and Ernie.

40:20.333 --> 40:23.833
He wasn't afraid, but knew better
than to play the fool with these two.

40:23.916 --> 40:26.458
He'd suffered
from their attentions over the years.

40:26.541 --> 40:27.583
Hands up.

40:27.666 --> 40:29.541
It was the only sensible thing to do.

40:29.625 --> 40:32.458
Raymond stepped forward
and snatched the binoculars away.

40:32.541 --> 40:34.375
"Who you spyin' on?" He snapped.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.666
Peter Watson considered the possibilities.

40:36.750 --> 40:39.458
He could turn and run,
but they'd catch him in seconds.

40:39.541 --> 40:42.041
He could shout for help,
but no one would hear him.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.291
All he could do,
therefore, was to keep calm

40:44.375 --> 40:46.666
and try to talk his way
out of the situation.

40:46.750 --> 40:49.166
"I was watching
a green woodpecker," Peter said.

40:49.250 --> 40:52.375
"A what?"
"A male, green woodpecker." Picus viridis.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.750
"He was tapping the trunk
of that dead tree, searching for grubs."

40:55.833 --> 40:57.791
"Where is he?"
Ernie said, raising his gun.

40:57.875 --> 41:00.083
"I'll 'ave 'im!"
"No, you won't," Peter said,

41:00.166 --> 41:03.166
looking at the string of birds
slung over Raymond's shoulder.

41:03.250 --> 41:06.750
"He flew off the moment you shouted.
Woodpeckers are extremely timid."

41:12.541 --> 41:14.416
Raymond whispered in Ernie's ear.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.833
Ernie slapped his thigh. "Great idea!"

41:16.916 --> 41:19.625
He placed his gun on the ground
and advanced upon the small boy.

41:19.750 --> 41:21.125
He threw him to the ground.

41:21.208 --> 41:24.000
Raymond took out some string
and cut off a length of it.

41:24.083 --> 41:26.166
They tied Peter's wrists together tight.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.750
"Now the legs," Raymond said.

41:27.875 --> 41:30.500
Peter struggled
and received a punch in the stomach.

41:30.583 --> 41:32.291
That winded him, and he lay still.

41:32.375 --> 41:34.791
The bigger boys
tied his ankles with more string,

41:34.875 --> 41:36.333
trussed him like a chicken.

41:36.416 --> 41:37.875
Ernie picked up his gun,

41:38.000 --> 41:41.125
and they began to carry the boy
towards the railway lines.

41:41.250 --> 41:43.166
Peter Watson kept absolutely quiet.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.041
Whatever they were up to,
talking wouldn't help matters.

41:46.125 --> 41:47.958
They dragged him down the embankment

41:48.041 --> 41:51.125
and laid him lengthwise
between the tracks. These tracks here.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.333
These tracks right here.

41:54.416 --> 41:57.375
This happened to me 27 years ago.
My name is Peter Watson.

41:58.916 --> 42:00.500
"More string," Ernie said.

42:04.625 --> 42:06.666
When they finished, Peter was helpless,

42:06.750 --> 42:08.416
tied fast between the rails.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.166
The only parts he could move
were his head and feet.

42:11.250 --> 42:14.083
Ernie and Raymond stepped back
to survey their handiwork.

42:14.166 --> 42:16.083
"We done a nice job," Ernie said.

42:16.166 --> 42:19.041
"This is murder,"
said the boy lying between the rails.

42:19.125 --> 42:21.041
"Not for certain," said Ernie.

42:21.125 --> 42:23.083
"Depends how much clearance
the trains have."

42:23.166 --> 42:26.666
"You keep down flat,
you might just get away with it." [laughs]

42:27.291 --> 42:30.708
The bigger boys climbed up the embankment
and sat behind some bushes.

42:30.791 --> 42:32.916
Ernie produced a pack of cigarettes.
They smoked.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.208
Peter knew
they weren't going to release him.

42:35.291 --> 42:37.208
These were dangerous, crazy boys.

42:37.291 --> 42:39.750
Dangerous, crazy, stupid boys.

42:39.833 --> 42:42.583
"I must try to keep calm and think,"
Peter told himself.

42:42.666 --> 42:44.791
He lay there, still, weighing his chances.

42:44.875 --> 42:46.791
The highest part of his head was his nose.

42:46.875 --> 42:50.458
He estimated his nose was sticking up
about four inches above the rails.

42:50.541 --> 42:53.125
Was that too much?
Hard to say with modern diesels.

42:53.250 --> 42:56.291
His head rested
upon loose gravel between two sleepers.

42:56.375 --> 42:58.666
He must try to burrow down a little.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.500
He began to wriggle his head
pushing the gravel away

43:01.625 --> 43:04.333
and gradually making for himself
a small indentation.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.750
He reckoned
he'd lowered his head two inches.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.833
That would do. But what about the feet?

43:08.916 --> 43:11.750
He tucked them pigeon-toed
so they lay almost flat,

43:11.833 --> 43:13.541
then waited for the train to come.

43:13.625 --> 43:17.208
He wondered whether there might be
a vacuum created underneath the train

43:17.291 --> 43:20.333
as it rushed over him,
sucking him upward. There might.

43:20.416 --> 43:21.916
He must concentrate everything

43:22.000 --> 43:24.750
upon pressing his entire body
against the ground.

43:24.875 --> 43:28.625
"Don't go limp. Keep stiff and tense
and press down into the ground."

43:28.708 --> 43:30.833
Peter watched the white sky
above his head,

43:30.916 --> 43:33.708
where a single cumulus cloud
was drifting slowly.

43:33.791 --> 43:35.541
An aeroplane came across the cloud.

43:35.625 --> 43:37.833
A small high-winged monoplane
with a red fuselage.

43:37.916 --> 43:42.000
An old Piper Cub, he thought it was.
He watched it until it disappeared.

43:42.083 --> 43:43.166
Then, quite suddenly,

43:43.291 --> 43:47.083
he heard a curious vibrating sound
coming from the rails either side of him.

43:47.166 --> 43:50.291
It was very soft, scarcely audible,
a tiny, thrumming whisper

43:50.416 --> 43:53.166
that seemed to be
coming along the rails from far away.

43:53.833 --> 43:55.166
[rails rattling softly]

43:58.916 --> 44:01.666
Peter raised his head
and looked down the railway line

44:01.750 --> 44:03.875
that stretched for a mile in the distance,

44:03.958 --> 44:04.958
and saw the train.

44:05.041 --> 44:07.916
First, only a black dot,
but as he kept his head raised,

44:08.041 --> 44:09.541
the dot grew bigger and bigger

44:09.625 --> 44:12.000
and began to take shape
and was no longer a dot,

44:12.083 --> 44:15.291
but instead, the big, square,
blunt front-end of a diesel engine.

44:15.375 --> 44:17.625
Peter dropped his head
and pushed it down hard

44:17.708 --> 44:19.750
-into the hole in the gravel.
-[bell dinging]

44:19.833 --> 44:21.291
He pigeon-toed his feet flat.

44:21.375 --> 44:24.333
He shut his eyes tight
and pressed his body into the ground.

44:24.416 --> 44:27.208
The train came on with an explosive blast.

44:27.291 --> 44:28.916
Like a gun went off in his head.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.625
With the explosion
came a tearing, screaming wind

44:31.708 --> 44:35.041
like a hurricane blowing down his nostrils
and into his lungs.

44:35.166 --> 44:37.833
The noise was shattering.
The wind choked him.

44:37.916 --> 44:39.916
He felt as if he were being eaten alive

44:40.041 --> 44:43.875
and swallowed up in the belly
of a screaming, murderous monster.

44:43.958 --> 44:46.708
[Peter] And then it was over.
The train was gone.

44:46.791 --> 44:49.250
Peter Watson opened his eyes
and saw the white sky

44:49.333 --> 44:51.833
and the big, white cloud
still drifting overhead.

44:51.916 --> 44:54.416
It was all over, and he had done it.

45:00.916 --> 45:02.583
-Cut him loose.
-…Ernie said.

45:02.666 --> 45:05.458
Raymond cut the strings
binding Peter to the rails.

45:05.541 --> 45:07.875
"Undo his feet, but keep his hands tied."

45:07.958 --> 45:10.250
Raymond cut the strings around his ankles.

45:10.333 --> 45:13.375
"Oh, you're still a prisoner, matey,"
Ernie said.

45:13.458 --> 45:17.416
The two bigger boys marched Peter Watson
across the next field towards the lake.

45:17.541 --> 45:20.125
The prisoner's wrists
were still tied together.

45:20.208 --> 45:22.208
Ernie held the gun in his spare hand

45:22.291 --> 45:25.208
and Raymond carried the binoculars
he had taken from Peter.

45:28.833 --> 45:30.250
The lake was long and narrow

45:30.333 --> 45:32.583
with tall willow trees
growing along its bank.

45:32.666 --> 45:34.458
In the middle, the water was clear,

45:34.541 --> 45:37.000
but closer to the shore
was a forest of bulrushes.

45:37.083 --> 45:39.750
"Now, then," Ernie said.
"What I suggest is this."

45:39.833 --> 45:41.791
"You take his arms, I'll take his legs,

45:41.916 --> 45:45.791
and we'll swing him as far out as we can
over them nice muddy reeds."

45:45.875 --> 45:48.500
"Look!" Raymond interrupted.
"There! Let's have him!"

45:48.583 --> 45:50.583
Peter Watson turned and saw it at once.

45:50.666 --> 45:53.583
A nest consisting
of a huge pile of reeds and rushes

45:53.666 --> 45:55.791
that rose up two feet above the waterline.

45:55.916 --> 46:00.041
And, on top, a magnificent white swan
sitting serenely as the Lady of the Lake.

46:00.166 --> 46:03.583
Her head was turned towards the boys,
alert and watchful.

46:03.666 --> 46:06.041
"Holy cats!" cried Raymond.
"What a beauty!"

46:06.125 --> 46:09.583
Ernie let go of the prisoner's arm
and lifted the gun to his shoulder.

46:09.666 --> 46:13.166
"This is… This is a bird sanctuary,"
said Peter, stammering.

46:13.291 --> 46:15.083
"A what?" asked Ernie.

46:15.166 --> 46:18.333
Peter felt a wild rage
beginning to build up inside him.

46:18.416 --> 46:20.125
He tried to keep his voice calm.

46:20.208 --> 46:22.541
"Swans are the most
protected birds in England,

46:22.625 --> 46:26.083
and nobody shoots a bird on its nest.
She may have cygnets under her."

46:26.166 --> 46:29.375
"Please don't do it. You can't do it.
Please, don't do it! Stop!"

46:29.458 --> 46:30.875
[wings fluttering]

46:30.958 --> 46:33.125
The bullet hit the swan
in her elegant head

46:33.208 --> 46:36.291
and her long white neck
sank slowly to the side of the nest.

46:46.666 --> 46:47.541
Open.

47:00.500 --> 47:02.875
"Cut his hands free, Raymond.
He's our gun-dog."

47:02.958 --> 47:05.833
Raymond cut the strings
binding the small boy's wrists.

47:05.916 --> 47:07.000
"Go get him!"

47:07.083 --> 47:08.291
"I refuse," I said.

47:09.166 --> 47:12.250
Ernie hit Peter
across the face, hard, with his open hand.

47:12.333 --> 47:14.916
A trickle of blood
began running out of one nostril.

47:15.041 --> 47:18.583
"Try refusin' one more time,
and I'm goin' to make you a promise:

47:18.666 --> 47:21.500
I'll knock out every one
of your shiny white front teeth,

47:21.583 --> 47:23.625
top and bottom. You understand that?"

47:23.708 --> 47:24.666
Peter said nothing.

47:24.791 --> 47:26.958
"Answer me!" Ernie barked.
"You understand?"

47:27.041 --> 47:29.708
"Yes," Peter Watson said quietly.
"I understand that."

47:30.583 --> 47:32.416
Tears were running down Peter's face

47:32.500 --> 47:34.833
as he went down the bank
and entered the water.

47:34.916 --> 47:38.500
He waded out to the dead swan
and picked it up tenderly with both hands.

47:38.583 --> 47:42.083
Underneath were two tiny cygnets,
their bodies covered with gray down.

47:42.166 --> 47:44.416
They were huddling
in the center of the nest.

47:44.541 --> 47:46.791
"Any eggs?" Ernie shouted from the bank.

47:51.416 --> 47:53.791
"No," Peter answered. "Nothing."

47:59.041 --> 48:01.708
He carried the dead swan
back to the edge of the lake.

48:01.791 --> 48:05.583
He placed it gently on the ground,
and he stood up and faced the two others.

48:05.666 --> 48:08.833
His eyes, still wet with tears,
were blazing with fury.

48:08.916 --> 48:11.333
"It's you who ought to be dead," he said.

48:11.416 --> 48:14.833
Ernie seemed just a tiny bit taken aback,
but he quickly recovered.

48:14.916 --> 48:18.041
A dangerous little spark
danced in his small black eyes.

48:20.291 --> 48:21.791
"Give me your knife, Raymond."

48:24.416 --> 48:27.333
There is a joint in the bone
where the wing meets the bird.

48:27.416 --> 48:30.875
Ernie slid the knife into the joint
and cut through the tendon.

48:30.958 --> 48:32.625
The knife was sharp and cut well,

48:32.708 --> 48:34.916
and soon the wing came away
all in one piece.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.666
Ernie turned the swan over
and severed the other wing.

48:37.750 --> 48:40.250
"String," he said,
holding out his hand to Raymond.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.333
Ernie cut eight pieces,
each about a yard long.

48:45.416 --> 48:48.833
He tied the bits of string
along the top edge of the great wing.

48:48.916 --> 48:50.166
"Stick out your arms."

48:53.416 --> 48:55.875
Peter Watson stood in the sunshine
beside the lake

48:55.958 --> 48:57.500
on this beautiful May morning,

48:57.583 --> 48:59.916
the enormous, limp,
slightly bloodied wings

49:00.000 --> 49:02.291
dangling grotesquely at his sides.

49:02.416 --> 49:05.416
Ernie clapped his hands
and danced a little jig on the grass.

49:06.916 --> 49:08.916
[lively instrumental music playing]

49:11.875 --> 49:14.708
-[music stops]
-"Have you finished?" Peter Watson asked.

49:14.791 --> 49:17.291
"Swans don't talk," Ernie said.

49:17.375 --> 49:21.375
They marched along the bank of the lake
until they came to a tall willow tree.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.583
The branches hung down from a great height

49:23.666 --> 49:26.166
until they almost touched
the surface of the lake.

49:26.875 --> 49:28.500
"What you're gonna do, Mr. Swan,

49:28.583 --> 49:30.750
is climb to the top,
and when you get there,

49:30.833 --> 49:33.125
you'll spread out your wings
and take off!"

49:33.208 --> 49:35.041
"Fantastic!" cried Raymond.

49:35.125 --> 49:36.541
The thought of being high up

49:36.625 --> 49:39.708
and out of reach of these hooligans
appealed to Peter greatly.

49:39.791 --> 49:41.875
When he was up there, he'd stay up there.

49:41.958 --> 49:44.458
He doubted
they would bother to come up after him.

49:44.541 --> 49:46.875
If they did,
he could climb away on a thin limb

49:46.958 --> 49:49.125
that wouldn't take the weight
of two people.

49:49.208 --> 49:53.083
The tree was fairly easy to climb,
with low branches to give him a start up.

49:53.166 --> 49:55.083
"Higher!" shouted Ernie. "Keep going!"

49:55.166 --> 49:58.333
Peter eventually arrived at a point
where he could go no higher.

49:58.416 --> 50:01.458
His feet were standing
on a branch as thick as a man's wrist,

50:01.541 --> 50:03.958
and this branch
reached far out over the lake,

50:04.041 --> 50:05.833
then curved gracefully downward.

50:05.916 --> 50:07.875
He stood there resting after the climb.

50:07.958 --> 50:11.500
He was very high up, at least 50 feet.
He couldn't see the two boys.

50:11.583 --> 50:14.208
They were no longer
standing at the base of the tree.

50:14.291 --> 50:15.458
"Now listen carefully!"

50:15.541 --> 50:17.375
They had walked away from the tree

50:17.458 --> 50:20.791
to a point where they had a clear view
of the small boy at the top.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.125
Looking down at them now,

50:22.208 --> 50:24.375
Peter Watson realized
how sparse and slender

50:24.458 --> 50:26.125
the leaves of a willow tree were.

50:26.208 --> 50:28.083
They gave him almost no cover at all.

50:28.166 --> 50:30.125
"Start walking out along that branch!"

50:30.208 --> 50:34.083
"Keep goin' till you're out over
the nice muddy water! Then take off"

50:34.166 --> 50:35.916
Peter Watson didn't move.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.916
He kept his eyes on the distant figures
in the field below.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.458
They were standing quite still,
looking up at him.

50:41.541 --> 50:42.750
"I'm gonna count to ten,

50:42.833 --> 50:46.541
if you ain't spread them wings
and flown away, I'm gonna shoot you down."

50:46.625 --> 50:49.083
"That'll make two swans
I've knocked off today."

50:49.166 --> 50:50.583
"Here we go."

50:50.666 --> 50:56.333
"One, two, three, four, five, six!"

50:56.416 --> 51:00.833
Peter Watson remained absolutely still.
Nothing would make him move from now on.

51:00.916 --> 51:04.166
"Seven, eight, nine, ten!"

51:04.250 --> 51:06.708
Peter could see the gun
coming up to the shoulder.

51:06.791 --> 51:08.166
Pointing straight at him.

51:08.250 --> 51:09.833
He heard the crack of the rifle

51:09.916 --> 51:12.625
and the zip of the bullet
as it whistled past his head.

51:14.041 --> 51:15.916
[mimics gunshot, whooshing]

51:16.000 --> 51:17.958
It was frightening, but he didn't move.

51:18.041 --> 51:20.333
He could see Ernie loading the gun.

51:20.416 --> 51:23.500
"Last chance!" yelled Ernie.
"Next one's gonna get you!"

51:23.583 --> 51:24.416
Peter waited.

51:24.500 --> 51:26.208
He watched the boy among the buttercups

51:26.291 --> 51:28.708
in the meadow far below
with the other boy beside him.

51:28.791 --> 51:30.916
The gun came up
once again to the shoulder.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.291
This time he heard the crack
as the bullet hit him in the thigh.

51:34.375 --> 51:37.083
There was no pain,
but the force of it was devastating.

51:37.166 --> 51:39.875
Like someone had whacked him
with a sledgehammer,

51:39.958 --> 51:42.875
and it knocked both feet
off the branch he was standing on.

51:42.958 --> 51:44.916
He scrabbled with his hands to hang on.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.208
The small branch he was holding onto
bent over and split.

51:49.833 --> 51:50.666
[wood cracks]

51:57.375 --> 51:59.500
Some people, when they have taken too much

51:59.583 --> 52:01.833
and been driven
beyond the point of endurance,

52:01.916 --> 52:04.458
simply crumble and collapse and give up.

52:04.541 --> 52:06.666
Others, however, though they are not many,

52:06.791 --> 52:10.333
who will for some reason
always be unconquerable.

52:10.416 --> 52:13.666
You meet them in time of war
and also in time of peace.

52:13.791 --> 52:15.791
They have an indomitable spirit

52:15.916 --> 52:19.416
and nothing, neither pain
nor torture nor threat of death,

52:19.541 --> 52:21.625
will cause them to give up.

52:21.708 --> 52:24.166
Little Peter Watson was one of these.

52:24.250 --> 52:25.750
And as he fought and scrabbled

52:25.833 --> 52:28.833
to prevent himself
from falling out of the top of that tree,

52:28.916 --> 52:32.708
it came to him suddenly
that he was going to win.

52:32.791 --> 52:35.958
He looked up and saw a light
shining over the waters of the lake

52:36.041 --> 52:40.625
that was of such brilliance and beauty
he was unable to look away from it.

52:40.708 --> 52:43.958
The light was beckoning him,
drawing him on,

52:44.041 --> 52:47.958
and he dived towards the light
and spread his wings.

52:49.791 --> 52:52.666
Three different people
reported seeing a great white swan

52:52.791 --> 52:54.875
circling over the village that morning:

52:54.958 --> 52:55.958
a schoolteacher,

52:56.041 --> 52:58.833
a man replacing tiles
on the roof of the chemist's shop,

52:58.916 --> 53:01.250
and a boy playing in a nearby field.

53:01.333 --> 53:04.333
Mrs. Watson,
washing dishes in her kitchen sink,

53:04.416 --> 53:07.583
happened to glance up
through the window at the exact moment

53:07.666 --> 53:10.041
something huge and white
came crashing down

53:10.166 --> 53:12.708
onto the lawn in her back garden.

53:12.791 --> 53:14.458
She rushed outside.

53:14.541 --> 53:15.750
She dropped to her knees

53:15.833 --> 53:18.416
beside the small crumpled figure
of her only son.

53:19.291 --> 53:22.291
"My darling!" she cried. "My darling boy!"

53:24.666 --> 53:25.916
"What's happened to you?"

53:46.583 --> 53:48.583
[bell tolling in the distance]

54:01.166 --> 54:04.375
In the afternoon,
the rat man came to the petrol station.

54:04.458 --> 54:07.375
He sidled up the driveway
with a soft, stealthy gait.

54:07.458 --> 54:09.791
His feet made no noise at all
on the gravel.

54:09.875 --> 54:12.458
He had an army knapsack
slung over one shoulder.

54:12.541 --> 54:15.208
He wore an old-fashioned corduroy jacket
with large pockets.

54:15.291 --> 54:18.958
Corduroy trousers were tied around
the knees with lengths of white string.

54:19.041 --> 54:20.125
-Hello?
-Yes?

54:20.208 --> 54:21.083
Rodent operative.

54:21.166 --> 54:23.916
His small, dark eyes
moved swiftly over the premises.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.208
-The rat man?
-That's me.

54:25.291 --> 54:27.208
He was lean, leathery, a sharp face,

54:27.291 --> 54:28.791
two long, sulfur-yellow teeth

54:28.875 --> 54:31.291
protruding from the upper jaw
over the lower lip.

54:31.375 --> 54:34.333
His ears were round and thin,
set near the back of his head.

54:34.416 --> 54:35.791
The eyes were almost black,

54:35.875 --> 54:39.083
but when they looked at you,
there was a flash of yellow in them.

54:39.166 --> 54:41.666
-You've come quick.
-Special orders from the Health Office.

54:41.750 --> 54:43.958
And now
you're going to catch all the rats?

54:44.041 --> 54:44.958
-Yeah.
-How?

54:45.041 --> 54:45.875
Yes. How?

54:45.958 --> 54:49.166
Depends what rats, where they is.
Different methods for different rats.

54:49.250 --> 54:50.541
-Trap them, I suppose.
-What?

54:50.625 --> 54:51.541
-Trap 'em.
-Trap 'em?

54:51.625 --> 54:52.541
The rat man snorted.

54:52.625 --> 54:54.666
Won't catch 'em that way.
Rats ain't rabbits.

54:54.750 --> 54:56.000
He held his face up high,

54:56.083 --> 54:59.708
sniffing the air with a nose that
twitched perceptibly from side to side.

54:59.791 --> 55:03.166
Rats is clever. You wanna catch 'em,
you gotta know 'em.

55:03.250 --> 55:04.916
You gotta know rats on this job.

55:09.208 --> 55:11.541
You know what they do? They watch you.

55:11.625 --> 55:15.333
All the time you're preparin' how to
exterminate 'em, they're watchin' you.

55:15.416 --> 55:17.208
This ain't a sewer job, is it?

55:17.291 --> 55:18.875
No, it's not a sewer job.

55:18.958 --> 55:21.416
-Tricky things, sewer jobs.
-I shouldn't think so.

55:21.500 --> 55:24.583
You shouldn't, should you?
I'd like to see you do a sewer job.

55:24.666 --> 55:27.333
Just exactly how'd you set about it,
I'd like to know.

55:27.416 --> 55:28.583
Poison them, I suppose.

55:28.666 --> 55:30.833
And where exactly
would you put the poison?

55:30.916 --> 55:31.750
Down the sewer?

55:31.833 --> 55:33.333
The rat man sparkled, triumphant.

55:33.416 --> 55:35.125
Yeah, I knew it. "Down the sewer."

55:35.208 --> 55:37.541
Know what'd happen?
Get washed away completely.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.541
All your poison. Sewer's like a river.

55:39.625 --> 55:42.791
All right. Well, what would you do,
Mr. Rat Man? On a sewer job?

55:42.875 --> 55:44.666
The rat man advanced a step closer.

55:44.750 --> 55:46.916
His voice became secretive
and confidential,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.666
the voice of a man
divulging professional secrets.

55:49.750 --> 55:52.833
You works on the understandin'
a rat is a gnawin' animal, see?

55:52.916 --> 55:55.375
Anythin' you give 'em, they gnaws on it.

55:55.458 --> 55:58.500
So you got a sewer job on your hands.
What d'you do?

55:58.583 --> 56:01.416
His voice had the soft,
throaty sound of a croaking frog,

56:01.500 --> 56:04.583
and he seemed to speak all his words
with a wet-lipped relish,

56:04.666 --> 56:06.625
as if they tasted good on the tongue.

56:06.708 --> 56:07.791
You go down the sewer

56:07.875 --> 56:10.333
and you take along
some ordinary brown paper bags

56:10.416 --> 56:13.083
filled with plaster of paris powder.
Nothin' else.

56:13.166 --> 56:15.500
Then you suspend 'em
from the roof of the sewer

56:15.583 --> 56:17.958
so they hangs down
not quite touchin' the water.

56:18.041 --> 56:20.041
Just high enough so a rat can reach 'em.

56:20.125 --> 56:21.541
Claud was listening, rapt.

56:21.625 --> 56:25.833
Old rat comes swimmin' along the sewer,
sees the bag. He stops.

56:25.916 --> 56:28.500
[sniffs] Takes a sniff at it.
It don't smell so bad.

56:28.583 --> 56:30.083
-What's he do?
-He gnaws it.

56:30.166 --> 56:33.125
That's it! He starts gnawin' at the bag,
and the bag breaks,

56:33.208 --> 56:36.625
and the old rat
gets a mouthful of powder for his pains.

56:36.708 --> 56:37.541
Well?

56:37.625 --> 56:38.916
Well, that does him.

56:39.625 --> 56:41.041
-That kills him?
-Stone dead.

56:41.125 --> 56:43.375
-Plaster of paris…
-It swells when you wet it.

56:43.458 --> 56:45.666
Gets into the rat's tubes
and swells right up

56:45.750 --> 56:48.291
and kills him
quicker than anythin' in the world.

56:48.375 --> 56:50.083
That's where you got to know rats.

56:50.166 --> 56:52.208
His face glowed with a shifty pride.

56:52.291 --> 56:56.208
He rubbed his stringy fingers together,
holding the hands up close to his face.

56:57.791 --> 57:00.166
Now, where's them rats?

57:00.250 --> 57:02.708
The word "rats" came out
with a rich, fruity sound

57:02.791 --> 57:04.916
as if he were gargling with melted butter.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.583
In the hayrick across the road.

57:06.666 --> 57:09.041
-Not inside?
-Only in the hayrick. Nowhere else.

57:09.125 --> 57:13.541
I'll wager they're inside too,
gettin' in your food, spreadin' disease.

57:13.625 --> 57:16.875
-Got any sickness here?
-He looked pointedly at me, then at Claud.

57:16.958 --> 57:18.458
-Everyone's well.
-Quite sure?

57:18.541 --> 57:20.166
-Quite sure.
-You never know.

57:20.250 --> 57:23.000
He'd taken upon himself
the mantle of a public health officer,

57:23.083 --> 57:25.833
disappointed we were not suffering
from bubonic plague.

57:25.916 --> 57:29.416
Nevertheless, the rats are in the hayrick.
How will you remove them?

57:29.500 --> 57:31.750
The rat man grinned a crafty, toothy grin.

57:31.833 --> 57:34.250
He reached into his knapsack
and withdrew a large tin,

57:34.333 --> 57:36.750
weighing it up and down
in his hands as he spoke.

57:36.833 --> 57:39.208
Poison. Special poison. Deadly poison.

57:39.291 --> 57:42.958
They'd put you inside if they caught you
with even a spoonful of this.

57:43.041 --> 57:45.250
There's enough here to kill a million men.

57:45.333 --> 57:46.666
-Want to see?
-Yes, please.

57:46.750 --> 57:48.916
He took a penny and prized open the lid.

57:49.000 --> 57:49.833
There it is.

57:49.916 --> 57:53.500
He spoke almost lovingly of the stuff
and held it forward for Claud.

57:53.583 --> 57:55.125
[Claud] Corn or barley, is it?

57:55.208 --> 57:57.583
Oats. Oats soaked in deadly poison.

57:57.666 --> 58:01.333
You take just one grain in your mouth
and you're a goner in three minutes.

58:01.416 --> 58:03.458
Never out of me sight, this tin.

58:03.541 --> 58:05.541
[editor] He caressed the tin and shook it…

58:05.625 --> 58:06.583
[rat man mimics rattle]

58:06.666 --> 58:09.000
…so that the oat grains
rustled softly inside.

58:09.083 --> 58:12.375
But your rats don't get this today.
They wouldn't have it, anyway.

58:12.458 --> 58:16.750
That's where you got to know rats.
Rats is suspicious. Terrible suspicious.

58:16.833 --> 58:19.375
So today they get
some nice, clean, tasty oats

58:19.458 --> 58:21.291
as will do 'em no harm in the world.

58:21.375 --> 58:24.125
Fatten 'em up, that's all.
And tomorrow, the same again.

58:24.208 --> 58:26.541
And the day after that,
and the day after that.

58:26.625 --> 58:29.291
And it'll taste so good,
all the rats in the district

58:29.375 --> 58:31.083
will be comin' along soon enough.

58:31.166 --> 58:32.000
Very clever.

58:32.083 --> 58:34.958
You got to be clever on this job,
cleverer than a rat.

58:35.041 --> 58:36.500
And that's saying something.

58:36.583 --> 58:38.708
"You've almost got to be a rat yourself."

58:38.791 --> 58:40.625
It slipped out before I could stop myself.

58:40.708 --> 58:43.333
I couldn't help it,
I was looking at him at the time.

58:43.416 --> 58:45.166
The effect it had on him was surprising.

58:45.250 --> 58:46.208
-That's it!
-…he cried.

58:46.291 --> 58:48.416
Now you got it, you really said somethin'.

58:48.500 --> 58:51.458
A good ratter's gotta be
more like a rat than anythin' else.

58:51.541 --> 58:53.083
Cleverer even than a rat,

58:53.166 --> 58:55.791
and that is not an easy thing to be,
let me tell you.

58:56.750 --> 58:58.208
Well, let's get on with it.

58:58.291 --> 59:01.500
Lady Leonora Benson's
asking for me urgent up at the manor.

59:01.583 --> 59:02.666
She's got rats too?

59:02.750 --> 59:04.583
Everybody's got rats.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.958
The rat man ambled off down the driveway.

59:07.041 --> 59:09.875
The way he walked was so like a rat,
it made you wonder.

59:09.958 --> 59:13.541
That slow, almost delicate, ambling walk
with a lot of give at the knees

59:13.625 --> 59:16.541
and no sound at all
from his footsteps on the gravel.

59:16.625 --> 59:19.750
He hopped over the gate,
and walked quickly 'round the hayrick,

59:19.833 --> 59:22.333
scattering handfuls of oats
onto the ground.

59:22.416 --> 59:25.000
The next day he returned
and repeated the procedure.

59:25.083 --> 59:28.000
The day after that he came again,
and the day after that,

59:28.083 --> 59:31.416
and finally, on the fourth day,
he put down the poisoned oats.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.875
But he didn't scatter these.
Instead, he placed them in little piles

59:34.958 --> 59:36.791
at each corner of the hayrick.

59:39.291 --> 59:40.958
-You got a dog?
-[Claud] Yes.

59:41.041 --> 59:44.916
Well, if you want him to die a horrible,
twisting death, let him in that gate.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.083
The next day he came to collect the dead.

59:47.166 --> 59:49.875
Get me an old sack.
I'm gonna need one to put 'em in.

59:49.958 --> 59:53.458
He was puffed up and important now,
the black eyes gleaming with pride.

59:53.541 --> 59:56.791
He was about to display
the results of his catch to the audience.

59:56.875 --> 59:59.750
Claud fetched a sack
and we walked across the road.

59:59.833 --> 01:00:01.541
The rat man prowled around the hayrick,

01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:04.416
bending over to inspect
one of his piles of poison.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.375
-Something wrong here.
-…he muttered.

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:07.916
His voice was soft and angry.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.416
He ambled over to another pile
and got down to examine it closely.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.958
-Something wrong here.
-[Claud] What's the matter?

01:00:14.041 --> 01:00:17.125
He didn't answer, but it was clear
the rats hadn't touched his bait.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.333
"These are very clever rats here," I said.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:20.583
The rat man was annoyed

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:24.125
and showed it on his face and nose
and by the way the two yellow teeth

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:26.125
were pressing into his lower lip.

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:28.708
-Don't give me that crap.
-…he said, looking at me.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.625
Nothing's wrong with these rats,
somebody's feedin' 'em.

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:34.458
They got somethin' juicy
to eat somewhere, plenty of it.

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:38.625
No rats in the world will turn down oats
unless their bellies is full to burstin'.

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:40.333
The rat man turned away, sullen.

01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:43.916
He knelt down again scooping up
the poisoned oats with a small shovel,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.166
tipping it carefully back into a tin.

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.833
When he had finished, all three of us
walked back across the road.

01:00:50.916 --> 01:00:52.791
The rat man stood by the petrol-pump,

01:00:52.875 --> 01:00:54.791
a rather sorry, humble rat man now

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:57.541
whose face was beginning
to take on a brooding aspect.

01:00:57.625 --> 01:00:59.958
He had withdrawn into himself
over his failure,

01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:01.416
the eyes veiled and wicked,

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.750
the little tongue darting out to one side
of the two yellow teeth.

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:06.958
He looked up at me,
a surreptitious glance,

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:08.000
then over at Claud.

01:01:08.083 --> 01:01:10.083
His nose-end twitched, sniffing the air.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:13.208
He raised himself up and down
on his toes, swaying gently,

01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:15.833
and in a soft voice,
soft and secretive, he said…

01:01:15.916 --> 01:01:17.250
You want to see something?

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:19.625
He was trying to retrieve his reputation.

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:21.791
-What?
-You want to see something amazing?

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:24.916
He put his right hand
into the poacher's pocket of his jacket

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.541
and brought out a large, live rat
clasped tight between his fingers.

01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:29.541
Good God!

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.166
[chuckles] That's it. You see?

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.916
He was crouching slightly
and craning his neck forward

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.916
and leering at us and holding
this enormous brown rat,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
one finger and thumb making
a tight circle around its neck,

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:42.416
clamping its head
so it couldn't turn and bite.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.333
Do you go around
with rats in your pockets?

01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:46.375
Always a rat or two about me somewhere.

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:50.000
He put his free hand into the other pocket
and produced a small, white…

01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:52.625
-Is that a ferret?
-The rat man snickered, hissing.

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:55.416
The ferret seemed to know him
and stayed still.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.791
Nothing will kill a rat
quicker than a ferret.

01:01:57.875 --> 01:02:00.125
He held the two animals
close in front of him

01:02:00.208 --> 01:02:03.458
so the ferret's nose
came within six inches of the rat's face.

01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:06.125
The pink beady eyes of the ferret
stared at the rat.

01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:08.916
The rat struggled,
trying to edge away from the killer.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.125
-Now.
-…he said.

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:11.041
Watch.

01:02:12.916 --> 01:02:14.916
[editor] His khaki shirt
was open at the neck,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.416
and he lifted the rat
and slipped it down inside,

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.625
next to his skin.

01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:21.625
His belt prevented the rat
from going lower than his waist.

01:02:21.708 --> 01:02:23.291
He slipped the ferret in next.

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:26.250
Immediately, there was
a great commotion inside the shirt.

01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:29.916
It appeared the rat was running around
his body, chased by the ferret.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.750
Six or seven times they went around,
the small bulge chasing the larger one,

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.916
gaining on it slightly each circuit,
drawing closer and closer

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.625
until at last the two bulges
seemed to come together,

01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:42.416
and there was a scuffle
and a series of shrill shrieks.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.666
Throughout this performance,
the rat man stood absolutely still,

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.958
legs apart, arms hanging loosely,

01:02:48.041 --> 01:02:51.083
dark eyes resting calmly
on Claud's frozen face.

01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:55.666
Finally, he took his hand
and reached down into his shirt

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.416
and pulled out the ferret.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.875
With the other, he took out the dead rat.

01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:03.166
There were traces of blood
around the white muzzle of the ferret.

01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:06.708
"Not sure I liked that very much," I said.

01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:09.708
You never seen nothin' like it before,
I'll bet you that.

01:03:09.791 --> 01:03:11.083
Can't say I have.

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:13.833
You'll get a nasty nip
in the guts one of these days.

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:17.750
…Claud told him, but was intrigued,
and the rat man was becoming cocky again.

01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:19.958
You want to see something
far more amazing?

01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:23.125
Something you'd never believe unless
you're seeing it with your own eyes?

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:25.750
I glanced at Claud
more than slightly apprehensive.

01:03:27.791 --> 01:03:28.625
Yes.

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:31.500
The rat man slipped the dead rat
into one pocket

01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:32.833
and the ferret into the other.

01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:36.833
Then he reached into his knapsack
and produced a second live rat.

01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:37.750
Holy Christ!

01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:40.208
Always got one or two rats
about me somewhere.

01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:41.958
You got to know rats on this job,

01:03:42.041 --> 01:03:44.625
and if you wanna know 'em
you gotta have 'em around.

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:48.291
This is a sewer rat, this one.
An old sewer rat, clever as buggery.

01:03:48.375 --> 01:03:51.916
See him watchin' me all the time,
wonderin' what I'm gonna do next?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.333
-See him?
-Most unpleasant.

01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:54.666
"What will you do?"

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:58.083
I had a feeling I'd like
this demonstration less than the last one.

01:03:58.166 --> 01:04:01.250
-Fetch me a piece of string.
-Claud fetched a piece of string.

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.708
The rat man
looped it around the rat's hind leg.

01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:06.583
The rat struggled,
but the rat man held it tight.

01:04:06.666 --> 01:04:08.208
Now, you got a table inside?

01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:10.250
"We don't want the rat inside," I said.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:12.708
Well, I need a table.
Or somethin' flat, anyway.

01:04:12.791 --> 01:04:16.041
We walked over to the petrol-pump
and he put the sewer rat on top.

01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:19.625
He attached the string to a post
so the rat was now tethered.

01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:22.166
At first, it crouched,
unmoving and suspicious,

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:24.500
a big-bodied gray rat
with bright black eyes

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:28.083
and a scaly tail that lay in a long curl
on the metal surface.

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:30.666
It was looking away,
but watching him sideways

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.333
to see what he was going to do.

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:36.083
The rat man stepped back a few paces,
and immediately the rat relaxed.

01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:37.541
It sat up on its haunches

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:39.875
and began to lick
the gray fur on its chest.

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:42.500
Then it scratched its muzzle
with both front paws.

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:45.791
It seemed quite unconcerned
about the other men standing nearby.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:48.250
-How about a little bet?
-[editor] …the rat man said.

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:49.791
"No, thank you." I said.

01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:53.291
-[rat man] It's more fun if you bet.
-[Claud] What do you want to bet on?

01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:56.166
[rat man] I can kill that rat
without using my hands.

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.375
I'll put 'em in my pockets
and not use 'em.

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:01.166
[editor] It was apparent the rat man
was out to earn some money.

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:04.541
I looked at the rat that was to be killed
and began to feel sick,

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:06.541
not because it was going to be killed,

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:09.083
but because it was to be killed
in a special way,

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:11.291
with a considerable degree of enthusiasm.

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.375
-[Claud] You'll kick it with your feet.
-[rat man] No feet.

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.916
-No arms?
-No arms, no legs, no hands neither.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.625
-You'll sit on it.
-No squashing.

01:05:17.708 --> 01:05:19.500
-Let's see it.
-Bet me a quid first.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.416
Don't be bloody daft. Why should we?

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.125
-What'll you bet?
-Zero. Nothing.

01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:25.083
All right. Then it's a no-go.

01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:27.500
-He made as if to untie the string.
-I'll bet a shilling.

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:29.583
The sick sensation in my stomach
was increasing.

01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:32.291
But there was an awful magnetism
about this business.

01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:34.791
I found myself
unable to walk away or even move.

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:35.791
-You too?
-No.

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:37.625
Want me to do this for a lousy shilling?

01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:39.666
-I don't want you to do it.
-Where's the money?

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.541
Claud put a shilling on the petrol-pump.

01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:44.416
The rat man laid two sixpences
beside Claud's money.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.333
Bet's on.

01:05:45.416 --> 01:05:46.666
Claud and I stepped back.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:49.375
The rat man stepped forward,
put his hands in his pockets

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:51.833
and inclined his body
from the waist toward the rat.

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:53.500
The rat was crouching, alarmed.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:56.166
It seemed it was preparing
to spring at the rat man,

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.958
but then it began to reverse away,

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:00.416
dragging its body backwards
with crouching steps

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.625
until the string tautened on its hind leg.

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:04.833
The rat man
leaned further towards the rat,

01:06:04.916 --> 01:06:07.500
following it back and forth
with his eyes. Suddenly…

01:06:07.583 --> 01:06:10.208
-It panicked.
-…it panicked and leapt into the air.

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:12.291
[wind gusting]

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:16.791
The string pulled it up with a jerk
that must've nearly dislocated its leg.

01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:18.375
It crouched again at the edge,

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:21.333
as far away as the string would allow,
whiskers quivering,

01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:23.208
the long gray body rigid with fear.

01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:26.666
At this point, the rat man again
began to move his face very slowly,

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.875
closer and closer.

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:31.083
I wanted to cry out for him to stop,
but I couldn't speak.

01:06:31.166 --> 01:06:34.666
Something extremely unpleasant
was about to happen, I was sure of that.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:38.208
Something sinister and cruel,
but I had to see it now.

01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:41.583
Not more than the length of a man's hand
was separating the two.

01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:44.375
The rat pressed its body flat,
tense and terrified.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:45.833
The rat man was also tense,

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:49.416
but with a dangerous active tensity
that was like a tight-wound spring.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.041
The shadow of a smile
flickered around the skin of his mouth.

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:53.958
-[bell tolling]
-Then, suddenly, he struck,

01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:55.083
as a snake strikes,

01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:57.916
darting his head forward
with a swift knife-like stroke…

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.041
…that originated in the muscles
of the lower body…

01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:02.666
…and I had a glimpse
of the mouth opening wide…

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:03.791
…two yellow teeth…

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:06.541
[both] …the whole face contorted
by the effort of mouth-opening.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:09.791
More than that, I did not care to see.

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:12.208
I closed my eyes,
and when I opened them again,

01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:13.333
the rat was dead,

01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:15.958
the rat man
was slipping the money into his pocket

01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:17.666
and spitting to clear his mouth.

01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:21.791
And that's what
they makes licorice out of.

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:25.791
Rat's blood's what the big factories
and chocolate-makers use to make licorice.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.000
Nothin' wrong with a drop of rat's blood.

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:32.458
You are absolutely disgusting.

01:07:32.541 --> 01:07:35.000
But that's it, you see.
You eaten it many a time.

01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:38.166
Penny sticks and licorice bootlaces
all made from rat's blood.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.375
We don't want to hear
another word, thanks.

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:43.208
Boiled up in great cauldrons,
bubblin' and steamin'

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:45.333
and men stirrin' it with long poles.

01:07:45.416 --> 01:07:47.875
One of the big secrets
of the chocolate factories,

01:07:47.958 --> 01:07:51.791
and no one knows about it,
except the ratters supplyin' the stuff.

01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:54.791
Suddenly he noticed his audience
was no longer with him.

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:58.000
Our faces were hostile
and sick-looking and crimson with anger.

01:07:58.583 --> 01:08:01.375
He stopped and turned away
without another word.

01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:06.041
We watched as he sloped onto the road
with a slow, delicate, ambling walk.

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:09.000
His footsteps didn't make a sound,
not even on the gravel.

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:19.625
[bell tolling in the distance]

01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:23.125
Strange.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.958
The rats never ate the poisoned oats.

01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:31.208
There must be
something nutritious… in the hayrick.

01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:17.666
It was midnight when I drove home.

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:21.500
As I approached the bungalow,
I switched off the headlamps

01:09:21.583 --> 01:09:24.625
so the beam wouldn't swing through
the window and wake Harry Pope.

01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:27.083
I needn't have bothered.
His light was still on.

01:09:27.166 --> 01:09:28.916
I parked, went up to the porch,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.583
counting each step
so I wouldn't take an extra step,

01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:34.416
which wasn't there, at the top.
One, two, three, four.

01:09:39.333 --> 01:09:42.208
I went to Harry's room,
opened it quietly, and looked in.

01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:45.500
He was lying in bed awake.
He didn't move or even turn his head.

01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:47.791
But I heard him whispering,
almost inaudible…

01:09:47.875 --> 01:09:48.791
[whispering] Help.

01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:49.708
"Help"?

01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:50.791
[clock ticking]

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:54.875
I pushed the door
and started across the room.

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:55.791
Stop.

01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:57.666
"Stop"? I could hardly hear a word.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:00.625
He seemed to be straining enormously
to produce sound.

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:02.458
-Help.
-"Help"?

01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:03.958
What's the matter, Harry?

01:10:04.041 --> 01:10:06.041
Take off shoes.

01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.791
"Take off shoes"?

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:11.833
He reminded me of George Barling
after he got shot in the stomach

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.583
when he leaned against a crate,

01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:16.375
gripping himself
and muttering about the Japanese pilot

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:19.458
in just the same straining
half-whisper Harry was using now.

01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:21.791
Then George Barling bent over, of course…

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:22.708
and died.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.500
Take off shoes.

01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:26.291
"Take off shoes."

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:30.958
I couldn't understand,
but I wasn't going to object.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.500
-What is it, Harry?
-Don't touch.

01:10:41.916 --> 01:10:45.291
He was on his back with a sheet
covering three-quarters of his body,

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.666
wearing striped pajamas
and sweating terribly.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:50.083
It was hot.
I was sweating, but not like Harry.

01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:52.291
His face was wet
and the pillow was soaked.

01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:53.833
It looked like malaria to me.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.250
-What is it, Harry?
-Krait.

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:56.208
-What?
-Krait.

01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:57.625
-"Krait"?
-Snake.

01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:00.583
You've been bitten. How long ago?

01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:01.500
No.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:02.416
What?

01:11:06.041 --> 01:11:07.250
Didn't bite yet.

01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:11.541
That confused me.
I gave Harry a funny look.

01:11:13.416 --> 01:11:16.250
Krait on stomach. Asleep.

01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:20.833
I jumped backwards. I couldn't help it.

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:23.583
I stared at his stomach,
at the sheet that covered it.

01:11:23.666 --> 01:11:26.625
It was impossible to tell
if there was something underneath.

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:29.833
You don't mean there's a krait
on your stomach now? Asleep?

01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:30.750
Yes.

01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:39.833
How'd it get there?

01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:43.625
I shouldn't have asked a question.
I should've just told him to keep quiet.

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:50.958
Lying on back. Reading.
Felt something on chest, behind book.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:51.958
Tickling.

01:11:54.291 --> 01:11:59.750
From corner of eye,
saw little krait sliding over pajamas.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:02.958
Small. Maybe ten inches.

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:07.750
Knew mustn't move.
Lay frozen, watching it.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:12.041
Thought it would go over top of sheet.

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:13.750
[Woods] Harry was silent for a moment.

01:12:13.833 --> 01:12:17.541
He was making sure his whispering
wasn't disturbing the thing laying there.

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:20.458
It went under.

01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:26.000
Felt it through pajamas.
Moving on stomach.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:31.333
Then it stopped. Now lying there asleep.

01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:36.375
I've been waiting.

01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:38.916
-[Woods] How long?
-For hours.

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.583
Hours and hours
and bloody hours and hours.

01:12:42.666 --> 01:12:45.458
Can't keep still much longer.
Need to cough.

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:49.875
[Roald] In fact,

01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:52.375
it wasn't a surprising thing
for a krait to do.

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:56.041
They linger around people's houses
and go for the warm places.

01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:59.208
The surprising thing was
that Harry hadn't been bitten so far.

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:02.250
The bite is ferociously deadly,
unless you catch it at once,

01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:04.625
with a dose of antivenom
immediately at hand.

01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:07.541
Slim, little things. They look like this.

01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.500
One might slip, discreetly,

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:15.583
through the just-cracked open door
of a small child's bedroom, for instance.

01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:21.375
The manager of a tea estate once told me
about a sheep bitten on the hind leg.

01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:25.750
When he cut open the carcass,
its blood ran pitch, black as tar.

01:13:29.916 --> 01:13:33.208
[whispering] "All right, Harry," I said.
Now I was whispering too.

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:35.625
Don't move
and don't talk unless you have to.

01:13:35.708 --> 01:13:38.250
It won't bite unless it's frightened.
We'll fix it.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.708
[in normal voice] I went out softly

01:13:42.791 --> 01:13:45.208
and fetched a small sharp knife
from the kitchen.

01:13:45.291 --> 01:13:49.500
I put it in my pocket ready to use in case
Harry frightened the krait and got bitten.

01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:51.958
I was ready to cut Harry
and suck out the venom.

01:13:52.958 --> 01:13:55.583
[whispering] "Harry,
I think the best thing to do

01:13:55.666 --> 01:13:58.750
is for me to draw back the sheet
very gently and have a look."

01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:01.375
You idiot.

01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:06.708
There was no expression in his voice.
He spoke too slowly and softly for that.

01:14:06.791 --> 01:14:10.125
The expression was in the eyes
and corners of the mouth.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:14.583
Light will startle. Snake will kill me.

01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:17.625
Good point.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:21.416
How about I whip back the sheet
and brush it off the instant--

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.583
Get doctor.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:27.333
He looked at me as if
I should have thought of that myself.

01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:30.125
A doctor. Of course.
That's it. I'll get Dr. Ganderbai.

01:14:30.208 --> 01:14:32.708
[in normal voice] I tiptoed out,
looked up Dr. Ganderbai's number,

01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:35.166
lifted the phone
and told the operator to hurry.

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:36.458
[phone ringing]

01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:37.541
[clock ticking]

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:43.458
-This is Supervisor Woods.
-Hello, Mr. Woods. You're not in bed yet?

01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:45.666
Come at once and bring serum. For a krait.

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:47.375
Serum? Who's been bitten?

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:50.000
The question came
like a small explosion in my ear.

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:51.208
No one. No one, yet.

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:54.166
Harry's got one
sleeping on his stomach under the sheet.

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.916
For about three seconds
there was silence on the line.

01:14:58.291 --> 01:15:02.000
Speaking slowly, not like an explosion,
precisely, Dr. Ganderbai said…

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:04.958
He's not to move or talk.
Do you understand?

01:15:05.041 --> 01:15:06.958
-Of course, Doctor.
-I'm coming now.

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:09.208
He rang off,
and I went back to the bedroom.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.208
Harry's eyes walked me to his bed.

01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:15.750
[whispering] Dr. Ganderbai's coming.
He said to lie still.

01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:19.125
-What does he think I've been doing?
-No talking. Either of us.

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:20.333
Shut up, then.

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:24.583
The muscles on one side of his mouth,
the muscles used for smiling

01:15:24.666 --> 01:15:26.500
started twitching, little movements

01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:29.250
that continued for a while
after he finished speaking.

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.166
I didn't like that,
or the way he talked, either.

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:35.291
-[car approaching]
-Dr. Ganderbai's car sped up to the front.

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:38.333
I went out to meet him.

01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:44.375
-Where is he?
-Dr. Ganderbai didn't stop for my answer.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:47.791
He walked on past me into the hall.
He put his bag down on a chair.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.791
He was wearing
soft-soled bedroom slippers.

01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:52.791
He walked across the floor noiselessly,
like a careful cat.

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:54.875
Harry watched out the sides of his eyes.

01:15:54.958 --> 01:15:57.625
Upon reaching the bed,
he looked at Harry and smiled,

01:15:57.708 --> 01:15:59.833
reassuring, nodding his head as if to say…

01:15:59.916 --> 01:16:03.083
Don't worry. This is a simple matter.
Leave it to Dr. Ganderbai.

01:16:03.166 --> 01:16:05.375
He went into the kitchen,
and I followed him.

01:16:06.916 --> 01:16:08.125
He opened his bag.

01:16:08.208 --> 01:16:12.166
First is to try to get serum into him,
but I must do it neatly. He can't flinch.

01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:14.500
He held a hypodermic and a small bottle.

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:17.333
He stuck in the needle
and drew up a pale yellow liquid.

01:16:17.416 --> 01:16:19.875
-He handed it to me.
-Hold that till I ask for it.

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.166
We returned to the room.

01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:23.916
[clock ticking]

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:28.416
[whispering] Harry's eyes were bright now
and wide open.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.916
Dr. Ganderbai
cautiously rolled up Harry's sleeve

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.833
to the elbow without moving the arm.

01:16:32.916 --> 01:16:35.208
He stood well away from the bed.
He whispered…

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.416
I'm going to give you an injection.
Just a prick. Don't move.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.166
Don't tighten your stomach muscles.
Let them go limp.

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:44.708
Harry looked at the syringe.
His smiling muscle began to twitch again.

01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:49.291
Dr. Ganderbai took rubber tubing
and tied it tight around Harry's bicep.

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.958
He sponged a small area
of the forearm with alcohol.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.833
He held up the syringe,
squinting at the calibrations,

01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:56.291
squirting out some fluid.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:58.208
Harry was sweating all over his face

01:16:58.291 --> 01:17:00.708
so it shone like face cream
melting on his skin,

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:01.833
running down the pillow.

01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:05.458
I could see the blue vein on his forearm,
swollen under the tourniquet.

01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:08.833
Needle above the vein,
Ganderbai holding it flat against the arm,

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.250
sliding the needle sideways into the vein,

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:14.166
slowly and firmly
so it went in smooth as into cheese.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:17.208
Harry closed his eyes
and opened them again but didn't move.

01:17:17.291 --> 01:17:19.583
Ganderbai leaned forward,
mouth close to Harry's ear.

01:17:19.666 --> 01:17:23.791
Now you'll be all right even if it bites,
but don't move. I'll be back in a moment.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.541
-"Is he safe now?" I asked.
-It might or might not save him.

01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:30.416
Ganderbai wiped his forehead
and stood nibbling his lip.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.458
There is a way to do this.
There is a way to do this.

01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:36.458
He was speaking slowly
and trying to think while he talked.

01:17:38.208 --> 01:17:42.291
We're going to administer an anesthetic

01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:45.000
to the creature where it lies.

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:48.333
It was a splendid suggestion.

01:17:48.416 --> 01:17:50.333
It's not safe. A snake is cold-blooded.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:53.125
Anesthetic doesn't work well
with cold-blooded animals.

01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:56.000
But I don't have any other ideas.
Ether or chloroform?

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:57.125
I nodded.

01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:59.583
-Which one?
-Was he asking me? I don't know.

01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:00.500
[loudly] Chloroform!

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:03.708
[in normal voice]
He pulled me to the hall.

01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:05.375
Drive to my house.

01:18:05.458 --> 01:18:07.291
The boy will be waiting for you.

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:09.291
Here's the key to my poisons cupboard.

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:11.375
Take chloroform. It has an orange label.

01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:14.541
The name is printed on it.
I'll stay in case anything happens.

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:15.833
Be quick!

01:18:15.916 --> 01:18:17.541
-My shoes…
-You don't need shoes.

01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:18.666
[engine starts]

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:23.583
[Woods] I drove fast, and in 15 minutes
I was back with the bottle.

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:29.916
He knows what we're going to do,
but he's understandably losing his nerve.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.083
I'm not sure how much longer he can last.

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:34.166
[lively music playing faintly]

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:38.708
[whispering] Harry was lying
in the same position as before.

01:18:38.791 --> 01:18:42.250
His face was white and wet.
He turned his eyes towards me.

01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:43.833
I smiled at him and nodded.

01:18:43.916 --> 01:18:46.666
The doctor picked up the tube
he'd used as a tourniquet,

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:48.958
now with a paper funnel
fitted into one end.

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:51.750
He untucked a section of sheet
from under the mattress,

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:53.541
took the rubber tube, inserted it,

01:18:53.625 --> 01:18:56.041
and slid it under the sheet
towards Harry's body.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:58.541
Not sure how long it took
to slide that tube in.

01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:01.708
It may have been 20 minutes, or 40.
I never saw the tube move,

01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:04.291
but the visible part of it
grew gradually shorter.

01:19:04.375 --> 01:19:06.333
Dr. Ganderbai himself was sweating now,

01:19:06.416 --> 01:19:08.875
large pearls on his forehead
and upper lip,

01:19:08.958 --> 01:19:10.291
but his hands were steady,

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:13.291
and his eyes were glued to the sheet
above Harry's stomach.

01:19:13.375 --> 01:19:15.375
He held out his hand for the chloroform.

01:19:15.458 --> 01:19:18.375
I twisted out the stopper
and put the bottle into his hand,

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:21.000
not letting go
until I was sure he had a good hold.

01:19:21.666 --> 01:19:25.958
Mr. Pope, I'm going to soak the mattress.
It's going to be cold under your body.

01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:29.208
-Be ready for it and don't move.
-[loud whisper] Get on with it!

01:19:29.291 --> 01:19:31.000
For the first time,
Harry raised his voice.

01:19:31.083 --> 01:19:34.208
Dr. Ganderbai looked up,
watched him and went back to business.

01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:37.541
He poured into the funnel
and waited while it ran down the tube.

01:19:37.625 --> 01:19:39.208
He poured more and waited again.

01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:50.666
The heavy, sickening smell of chloroform
spread over the room

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.500
bringing faint, unpleasant memories

01:19:52.583 --> 01:19:55.708
of nurses and surgeons
in a white room with a long white table.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.375
Ganderbai was pouring steadily,

01:19:57.458 --> 01:20:01.500
and I could see the heavy vapor swirling
like smoke above the paper funnel.

01:20:02.083 --> 01:20:05.083
He paused, poured one more
and handed the bottle back to me.

01:20:05.166 --> 01:20:07.625
Slowly he drew out the rubber tube,
then stood up.

01:20:07.708 --> 01:20:10.500
The strain of this procedure
must have been enormous

01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:12.625
because he sounded like this…

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.791
[softly] Give it 15 minutes to be safe.

01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:16.291
I leaned over to tell Harry.

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:18.291
-We'll give it--
-[loudly] I heard him!

01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:21.583
This time Dr. Ganderbai sprang 'round,
his face suddenly angry.

01:20:21.666 --> 01:20:25.125
Stared at Harry, a cold stone.
Harry's smiling muscle began to twitch.

01:20:25.208 --> 01:20:26.833
We waited 15 minutes by the bed.

01:20:26.916 --> 01:20:28.958
Dr. Ganderbai watched Harry's face

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:31.541
in the most curious,
profoundly intense, arresting gaze,

01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:33.250
concentrating all his will power

01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:35.875
on keeping Harry
absolutely still and quiet.

01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:38.583
He never took his eye away,
and although he made no sound,

01:20:38.666 --> 01:20:40.541
he seemed to be shouting at him.

01:20:40.625 --> 01:20:43.000
-Something like…
-[loudly] Don't move or speak!

01:20:43.083 --> 01:20:45.375
You're not spoiling this now! You hear me?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.583
In this silence,
Harry lay there twitching his mouth,

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:50.750
sweating, closing his eyes, opening them,

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:52.875
looking at me, the sheet, the ceiling,

01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:54.541
never looking at Dr. Ganderbai.

01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:56.750
Yet somehow,
Dr. Ganderbai was holding him.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:00.416
It was like someone
was blowing up a huge balloon,

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.125
that it was going to burst,
but I couldn't turn away.

01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:06.291
Finally Dr. Ganderbai nodded,
and I knew he was ready to proceed.

01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:08.166
Go to the other side.

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:10.791
We'll each take a side of the sheet
and draw it back together.

01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:13.000
Very slowly, please. Keep still, Mr. Pope.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.541
[Woods] The whole of Harry's chest
was visible now.

01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:28.791
I saw the white cord
of his pajama trousers

01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:30.083
neatly tied in a bow.

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:32.875
A little farther below,
I saw a mother-of-pearl button,

01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:34.791
something I never had on my pajamas,

01:21:34.875 --> 01:21:37.000
a fly-button,
let alone a mother-of-pearl one.

01:21:37.083 --> 01:21:38.291
Odd how one sometimes

01:21:38.375 --> 01:21:40.500
has frivolous thoughts
at exciting moments.

01:21:40.583 --> 01:21:42.375
Nothing else was on his stomach.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.083
Don't move, Mr. Pope.

01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:49.250
Ganderbai peered around
along Harry's body and under his legs.

01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:52.125
Be careful. It could be anywhere,
up the pajama leg.

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:53.041
Harry sat up.

01:21:53.125 --> 01:21:54.875
[breathing heavily]

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:56.625
It was the first time he'd moved.

01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.000
[exclaiming]

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:00.916
Harry jumped up, stood on his bed,
shook his legs violently.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.458
We thought he'd been bitten.

01:22:02.541 --> 01:22:04.291
Ganderbai was scrambling for a scalpel,

01:22:04.375 --> 01:22:06.208
but then Harry ceased leaping,
stood still,

01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:08.000
looked down at the mattress and shouted…

01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:08.916
It's not there!

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.583
Dr. Ganderbai straightened up.
He looked at Harry.

01:22:11.666 --> 01:22:13.791
Harry was all right.
He hadn't been bitten.

01:22:13.875 --> 01:22:15.916
He wasn't going to get bitten or killed.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.625
And everything was fine.

01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:18.583
Sort of.

01:22:19.625 --> 01:22:21.875
[chuckling] Maybe you were dreaming,
Mr. Pope.

01:22:24.458 --> 01:22:26.041
[heart beating]

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:31.500
[Woods] The way he said it,

01:22:31.583 --> 01:22:34.125
I knew his teasing
was not seriously intended.

01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:36.291
He was easing up after the extreme strain.

01:22:36.375 --> 01:22:39.000
Harry didn't take it that way.
He stood in his pajamas,

01:22:39.083 --> 01:22:41.958
glaring at Ganderbai. The color
began to spread over his cheeks.

01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:44.291
Are you suggesting I'm a liar?

01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:49.500
Dr. Ganderbai remained still,
watching Harry.

01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:52.791
Harry took a pace forward on the bed.
A shining look in his eyes.

01:22:53.958 --> 01:22:57.458
-You dirty, little, Bengali, sewer rat.
-"Shut up, Harry," I said.

01:22:57.541 --> 01:22:59.791
-You dirty, brown, filthy, little…
-Shut up!

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.333
-Backwards-caste…
-Shut your mouth!

01:23:01.416 --> 01:23:02.291
Stop!

01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:07.541
Dr. Ganderbai left the room,
I followed him into the hall,

01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:08.541
to the screened porch.

01:23:08.625 --> 01:23:10.666
He's out of his mind,
doesn't know what he's saying.

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:14.458
We went across the drive in the darkness
to the doctor's old Morris Motor car.

01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:17.625
He got inside.
"You did a miraculous thing," I said.

01:23:17.708 --> 01:23:19.916
-"You saved his life."
-No, I don't think so.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.750
I mean, you might've…
He owes you his life.

01:23:22.833 --> 01:23:25.625
-I mean, he owes you his life, Doctor.
-No, he doesn't.

01:23:28.208 --> 01:23:29.125
I'm sorry.

01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:31.583
You can't be.

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.375
[engine starts]

01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:41.416
Dr. Ganderbai started the engine
and drove off.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.083
[sharpener grinding]

01:24:12.875 --> 01:24:14.875
[mystical music playing]

01:24:24.666 --> 01:24:26.291
[author] Here are some of the qualities

01:24:26.375 --> 01:24:28.666
you should possess
or should try to acquire

01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:31.041
if you wish to become a fiction writer.

01:24:32.375 --> 01:24:34.875
You should have a lively imagination.

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:36.083
[music continues]

01:24:36.166 --> 01:24:38.125
You should be able to write well.

01:24:38.208 --> 01:24:39.166
By that I mean,

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:43.375
you should be able to make a scene
come alive in the reader's mind.

01:24:43.458 --> 01:24:45.333
Not everybody has this ability.

01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:49.208
It is a gift,
and you either have it or you don't.

01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:51.375
You must have stamina.

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:52.750
In other words,

01:24:52.833 --> 01:24:56.500
you must be able to stick
to what you're doing and never give up.

01:24:57.458 --> 01:24:59.041
For hour after hour…

01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.541
♪ Hour after hour ♪

01:25:00.625 --> 01:25:02.166

…year after year after year…

01:25:15.416 --> 01:25:17.833
You must be a perfectionist.

01:25:17.916 --> 01:25:21.500
That means you must never be satisfied
with what you have written

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:26.583
until you've rewritten it again and again,
making it as good as you possibly can.

01:25:27.458 --> 01:25:29.500
You must have strong self-discipline.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:32.791
You're working alone.
No one is employing you.

01:25:33.791 --> 01:25:37.666
No one is around to give you the sack
if you don't turn up for work

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:40.166
or to tick you off if you start slacking.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.041
It helps a lot
if you have a keen sense of humor.

01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:46.875
This is not essential
when writing for grown-ups,

01:25:46.958 --> 01:25:49.083
but for children, it's vital.

01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:51.458
[Roald] Finally…

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.125
You must have a degree of humility.

01:25:58.208 --> 01:26:00.375
The writer that thinks
his work is marvelous

01:26:01.791 --> 01:26:03.000
is heading for trouble.

01:26:15.708 --> 01:26:17.541
