11:03.913 --> 11:05.122
What happened to that one?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.833
Bunch of wise-asses
out in the park last night.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.419
Hassling bicyclists, beating up people.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.214
They're only 13, 14 at most.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.633
Parents are coming in
for family court tickets.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.301
What's "wilding"?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.346
-What's that?
-You said on your report here

11:20.429 --> 11:22.598
they were "wilding." What's that mean?

11:23.891 --> 11:25.643
[Farrell] I don't know.
One of them said it.

11:34.568 --> 11:35.444
Hey.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.699
What were you doing in the park
last night?

11:41.283 --> 11:43.285
Uh, nothing. I wasn't doing anything--

11:43.369 --> 11:45.329
[Fairstein] Did you see some bad guys
out there

11:45.413 --> 11:47.123
-doing some bad things?
-[knocks on desk]

11:51.585 --> 11:52.545
Um...

11:53.254 --> 11:54.255
Who were you...

11:54.714 --> 11:56.424
Who were you out in the park with?

11:57.425 --> 11:59.719
-Uh, I was out with my boy Tron.
-Mm-hm.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.011
Yeah.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.806
Out "wilding" with Tron, huh?

12:06.058 --> 12:06.892
No?

12:09.979 --> 12:11.105
Is Tron here?

12:12.940 --> 12:13.941
No? Okay.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.277
What's Tron's name and address?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.320
It's okay.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.531
Um...
Antron McCray.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.327
-[Fairstein] Uh-huh.
-He live around Schomburg.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.037
I don't know an exact...

12:27.538 --> 12:29.039
-an exact address.
-It's cool.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.792
That's cool. Thank you.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.513
So you were just gonna let
possible witnesses to a rape

12:44.597 --> 12:46.307
go on a family court ticket?

12:46.474 --> 12:49.185
Wake these kids up
and start getting some information.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.937
We've got a lady raped
and clinging to life here.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.356
I want their interviews
on my desk immediately

12:54.440 --> 12:56.108
so I can put together a timeline.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.485
Let's work.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.114
Wake up.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.534
[alarm buzzing]

13:05.618 --> 13:07.411
[man on radio]
<i>Good morning, New York City!</i>

13:07.495 --> 13:10.581
[woman] <i>Z100 New York bringing you</i>
<i>the latest hits on your way to work.</i>

13:10.664 --> 13:12.750
[man] <i>At the top of the 8:00 a.m. hour.</i>

13:13.250 --> 13:14.251
[woman] <i>Early...</i>

13:34.438 --> 13:35.397
What's this, babe?

13:36.273 --> 13:37.483
[sighs]

13:37.983 --> 13:41.237
Tronny was playing in the park and fell.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.906
It was so late, I had him put 'em there.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.537
What you mean, late?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.124
Your son didn't get in till almost 10:00.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.795
Said him and Clarence got caught up
in the park...

13:59.255 --> 14:01.590
<i>Clarence got taken down</i>
<i>to the police station.</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:05.052
[man] <i>Wait, what? What happened?</i>

14:07.638 --> 14:10.641
[woman] <i>Tronny said he was</i>
<i>playing tag in the park and fell at first.</i>

14:10.724 --> 14:12.768
I was following these big kids
in the park and...

14:12.852 --> 14:13.686
Mm-hm.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.563
-[woman] <i>When he said...</i>
-It was fun at first,

14:15.646 --> 14:18.607
but then they started throwing stuff.
That wasn't cool, you know?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.776
[woman] <i>...he said some kids were</i>
<i>causing a ruckus in the park</i>

14:20.860 --> 14:22.403
<i>-and that's when he left.</i>
-We left.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.612
You left, huh?

14:23.779 --> 14:25.614
How you get mud on your pants, bro?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.032
I-I was running.

14:27.783 --> 14:28.617
From who?

14:30.077 --> 14:31.078
Th-the police.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.918
Wait. Are you trying to tell me
all y'all was running from the police?

14:38.794 --> 14:41.380
Come on, Tron, we talked about this, man!

14:41.672 --> 14:43.966
You know better than that!
I taught you better than that.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.509
[buzzing]

14:48.387 --> 14:51.557
[indistinct police radio chatter]

14:55.352 --> 14:56.854
Go on, get your jacket, okay?

14:58.522 --> 14:59.899
-Go.
-Okay.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.286
And how long we gonna be downtown for?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.038
Not long.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.123
You'll make your shift.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.382
Those the clothes from last night?

15:27.176 --> 15:28.010
No, sir.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.554
Get the clothes from last night.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.147
I'm Aaron Rosenthal,
Assistant Chief of Detectives.

15:40.439 --> 15:44.485
At approximately 1:30 this morning,
two males walking across Central Park

15:44.568 --> 15:48.113
just north of the 102nd Street
jogging path found a female.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.325
Uh, she was still alive
and is in fact still alive.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.452
Uh, she was taken to Metropolitan Hospital

15:53.535 --> 15:56.038
where she is classified
as being in serious condition.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.414
That's all we've got.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.084
[Fairstein] Multiple attacks.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.840
9:00 p.m., confirmed.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.759
110th...

16:13.180 --> 16:14.264
Okay.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.641
9:10...

16:16.767 --> 16:20.062
Okay, bicyclists confirmed on East Drive.

16:24.566 --> 16:25.693
9:15...

16:26.735 --> 16:31.407
first walking patron confirmed assault
on East Drive.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.284
Hey. Farrell's interviews
with the boys are in.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.706
-What you got?
-All this is happening in the park...

16:39.665 --> 16:41.250
and it's not connected?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.630
They're not witnesses.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.716
They're suspects.

16:51.593 --> 16:55.014
Put a call into the DA's office
and ask Elizabeth Lederer.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.390
I want her on this.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.726
Uh, I think Nancy Ryan
in Homicide Division--

16:58.809 --> 17:01.020
This is a sex crimes unit.
It's not a homicide.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.439
-[officer] Nancy Ryan's on her way.
-I'm here.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.025
Hey, Linda.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.323
This doesn't sound like something
your unit should handle, Linda.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.659
What happened in Central Park
is a sex crime.

17:15.743 --> 17:20.080
When you gave me this unit to run, Robert,
it was for exactly this kind of case.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.958
North Homicide's already working.
I got six detectives on this.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.837
-I was at the crime scene before daylight.
-Well, I got there <i>before </i>you.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.093
I've had precinct guys here
interviewing suspects...

17:33.177 --> 17:34.428
-Suspects?
-...in custody.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.806
You've got a dozen kids
harassing bicyclists.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.516
And beating up joggers.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.270
A public school teacher's at Metropolitan
with a fractured skull.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.065
I'm about to get Rosario to the hospital
to interview him.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.693
Right now, these kids...
these kids were on a rampage.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.950
It's your call, Mr. Morgenthau.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.245
<i>-Well, look--</i>
-Before you decide, Robert, just...

18:00.537 --> 18:01.580
just hear me out.

18:02.581 --> 18:07.878
There were 3,412 rapes
reported to the NYPD last year.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.465
3,412 times

18:11.548 --> 18:16.637
someone was assaulted, held down,
threatened, degraded...

18:17.596 --> 18:18.430
forced.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.893
<i>This has gone way beyond problematic.</i>

18:22.976 --> 18:25.896
This is an epidemic.
We are not in control.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.065
And we <i>can </i>be.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.861
The two of you work it out.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.155
<i>Call me as soon as you make a decision.</i>

18:37.032 --> 18:38.075
[switches speakerphone off]

18:41.328 --> 18:44.832
These males terrorized bicyclists here.

18:45.249 --> 18:49.086
They put two guys in the hospital
with head injuries here.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.046
A 50-year-old man they attacked here,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.799
and a public school teacher
jogging at the reservoir.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.425
And way up here...

18:56.426 --> 19:00.764
they brutally raped a woman
and discarded her like a piece of garbage.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.225
-Left her for dead.
-[detective] What a mess.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.893
[Fairstein] Bleeding, bound.

19:06.728 --> 19:07.563
Naked.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.693
And to think we were gonna release
these animals to family court

19:13.110 --> 19:15.237
and put them back on the streets.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.239
I got a question.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.323
For all of you.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.326
At 9:30, they're terrorizing folks here.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.454
At 10:00, one of them is raping
the female jogger here.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.248
What happened in the half-hour
in between?

19:26.331 --> 19:28.333
What did these animals do

19:28.917 --> 19:31.336
between here and here?

19:33.046 --> 19:33.964
Hm?

19:34.756 --> 19:37.676
Are there other victims still in the park?

19:39.428 --> 19:40.596
[indistinct conversation]

19:45.601 --> 19:46.476
Good luck.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.812
You're gonna need it.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.941
[indistinct conversation continuing]

19:56.695 --> 19:57.988
[sighs]

19:59.740 --> 20:01.158
I need that whole group.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.620
I have some of them
and descriptions of others,

20:04.703 --> 20:06.663
but I need all of them.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.708
Every young black male
who was in the park last night

20:09.791 --> 20:14.004
is a suspect in the rape of that woman
who is fighting for her life right now.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.757
I want units out strong...

20:16.840 --> 20:18.550
-[distant siren wailing]
<i>-Come on, guys.</i>

20:18.634 --> 20:19.885
<i>What did we miss?</i>

20:19.968 --> 20:22.262
<i>Let's get an army of blue up in Harlem.</i>

20:22.346 --> 20:26.266
<i>You go into those projects</i>
<i>and you stop every little thug you see.</i>

20:26.350 --> 20:29.394
<i>You bring in every kid</i>
<i>who was in the park last night.</i>

20:29.478 --> 20:32.397
Yo, he stays there all the time.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.482
-No way.
-All day.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.942
With that same newspaper?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.902
-Without fail.
-[man] I want to know, that's why.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.988
Okay, that's not even a fucking street.
Come on.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.324
-Let's go this way, Kane.
-[questioning continues]

20:42.407 --> 20:44.618
-[detective 1] He's a fucking comedian.
-Kane!

20:44.952 --> 20:45.869
Hustle!

20:47.871 --> 20:49.373
You never seen that name before?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.125
[detective 1] Hey!

20:52.834 --> 20:53.835
You got ID?

20:57.047 --> 20:58.257
-Huh?
-Yeah.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.841
-Um...
-[detective 1] Huh?

21:00.259 --> 21:03.262
-Only ID I have is my bus pass.
-[detective 1] Well, let's see it.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.600
[officer 2] Fits the description.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.397
Yep. Yusef Salaam, 16.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.190
What, you in 11th grade?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.316
Yeah.

21:17.734 --> 21:18.777
I'm actually 15.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.863
You graduate high school next year,
you're telling me you're 15?

21:21.947 --> 21:23.907
He skipped some grades.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.787
-And I changed the birth date on that.
-[detective 2] How come?

21:29.663 --> 21:31.331
I was trying to impress some girls.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.833
We'll go with 16.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.337
Come on.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.298
Come here. Come here.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.176
You 16?

21:45.387 --> 21:47.014
-Huh?
-Sixteen.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.473
[detective 1] What's your name?

21:48.974 --> 21:49.808
Korey Wise.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.768
He's not on the list.

21:53.895 --> 21:54.730
Take him.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.607
You wanna go downtown with your buddy?
You'll be right back.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.113
I guess so. I mean...

22:03.530 --> 22:05.532
your moms would kill me if I don't, so...

22:06.658 --> 22:07.492
Come on.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.162
[detective 1] Go ahead.
You're a good friend, you know?

22:10.662 --> 22:11.913
Sticking with your buddy.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.334
Hey, girl. You seen my son?

22:15.876 --> 22:19.296
[woman] <i>No. Nothing but a bunch</i>
<i>of roughnecks out in the plaza today.</i>

22:20.297 --> 22:22.883
And he know he's supposed to be home
before I get home.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.092
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

22:24.676 --> 22:27.763
All right, if you see him,
you tell him to get his behind home.

22:27.846 --> 22:28.889
<i>I'll let him know.</i>

22:29.056 --> 22:32.059
-All right. Bye. Thank you.
<i>-All right. Bye.</i>

22:35.062 --> 22:37.731
We've got suspects,
we've got kids in custody.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.526
Interrogate.
Make them name their accomplices.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.904
This is not business as usual.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.822
The press is crawling all over this.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.366
No kid gloves here.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.035
These are not kids. They raped this woman.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.204
Our lady jogger deserves this.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.132
[officer] Wait, not him.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.134
That's Kevin Richardson.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.844
He's only 14.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.971
His mother felt sick, so she left.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.431
Needed her medication.

23:12.265 --> 23:13.683
The mother left voluntarily?

23:14.976 --> 23:16.019
Is it snowing?

23:17.813 --> 23:18.688
What?

23:19.022 --> 23:21.024
It suddenly feels like Christmas.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.361
Here we go.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.078
[detective 1] The sooner you tell us
what you know, the sooner you go home.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.621
You got it?
Yeah.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.710
-Uh, yes, Officer.
-Detective.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.212
I'm Detective Hartigan.

23:43.296 --> 23:46.466
Let's start with you telling us
who you were in the park with.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.385
[sighs]

23:49.094 --> 23:51.012
I don't know names. I just...

23:51.471 --> 23:52.639
I just got lost.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.100
[detective 2] Sit up.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.102
This isn't a game.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.776
Is my... Is my mom here?

24:05.527 --> 24:06.528
[Hartigan] She left.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.823
She wasn't feeling well.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.202
It's just us.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.580
You and us.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.166
[detective] Antron,

24:19.249 --> 24:22.252
Clarence told us you two were in the park
with the kids who were beating people up.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.005
That right?

24:27.757 --> 24:28.758
Speak up, son.

24:32.679 --> 24:33.513
Yes, sir.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.850
You tell the truth, you clear things up,

24:37.476 --> 24:38.685
we send you home, okay?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.104
-Yes, sir.
-[detective] Great.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.982
[detective]
Why was everybody but you, Yusef,

24:44.065 --> 24:45.942
randomly beating up innocent people?

24:46.276 --> 24:48.487
I didn't go in there to beat up on people.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.448
I just wanted to hang
with Korey and Eddie.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.202
I wouldn't have gone if I had known
that's why we were there.

24:55.368 --> 24:56.828
So you didn't do nothing?

24:58.330 --> 25:00.665
You were just rolling through the park
with your boys

25:00.999 --> 25:02.501
on a casual stroll?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.215
[detective]
You're in the eighth grade, Raymond?

25:08.298 --> 25:10.050
[translates into Spanish]

25:10.258 --> 25:11.968
Um, I'm in seventh.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.721
Pretty big for seventh.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.306
[translates into Spanish]

25:18.475 --> 25:19.559
I grew some this year.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.481
What do you know about rape?

25:28.276 --> 25:29.402
[Raymond] It's, uh...

25:30.403 --> 25:31.488
something about sex?

25:33.823 --> 25:34.658
[speaking in Spanish]

25:36.701 --> 25:40.247
[speaking in Spanish]

25:41.498 --> 25:43.083
Ms. Cruz is gonna take a break.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.335
[detective 2 speaking in Spanish]

25:53.009 --> 25:54.219
[speaking in Spanish]

25:59.391 --> 26:00.392
[door closes]

26:02.018 --> 26:02.894
[detective] Ray.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.438
We need some answers here.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.192
Where did you see the lady?

26:10.694 --> 26:12.487
Who... What lady?

26:13.446 --> 26:14.364
Kevin...

26:14.990 --> 26:16.491
Antron and Raymond

26:17.117 --> 26:19.119
saw you messing around
with the lady.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.206
Wh-who said that?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.876
Kevin Richardson said you raped the lady
in the park.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.297
-What? No, that's not possible.
-Wait a minute. Wait a second.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.299
That is not poss... This is my son!

26:32.382 --> 26:34.134
I don't know what you're talking about.
That didn't happen.

26:34.217 --> 26:36.469
-Kevin says it did.
-Wait, who's Kevin?

26:36.553 --> 26:37.596
[detective] Come on.

26:37.929 --> 26:44.185
Antron McCray and Raymond Santana
said they saw you rape the lady.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.438
You got that?

26:46.521 --> 26:49.649
I never saw... I never saw no lady.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.026
-Really?
-I didn't... No.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.028
I didn't see any lady.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.196
-[detective] Kevin...
-I didn't see any lady.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.489
Who you talking about?

26:56.573 --> 26:57.949
The lady in the park!

26:59.534 --> 27:01.411
I didn't see a lady or hit anyone.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.288
Raymond saw you hit her!

27:03.455 --> 27:04.539
Who's Raymond?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.458
Wanted to stick your cock
in a white lady, huh?

27:06.583 --> 27:09.377
-Don't you fucking lie to me!
-[Hartigan] Hey! Calm down!

27:16.509 --> 27:17.510
Listen, Ray...

27:18.720 --> 27:21.097
kids like you don't do this shit.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.434
Got too much going for you.
Weirdos do this shit.

27:24.517 --> 27:27.145
Weirdos and perverts rape ladies.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.231
That ain't you.
You got no reason to rape a lady.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.777
You probably get your pick of the girls,
right?

27:37.030 --> 27:37.906
I...

27:38.740 --> 27:40.909
-I never had a problem with girls.
-Exactly.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.827
Which is how I know

27:43.244 --> 27:46.289
that you're not doing what
these other fucking kids are saying.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.876
What are they saying about me?

27:50.377 --> 27:51.628
They don't even know me.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.380
They're saying all kinds of shit.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.300
You're involved... is what they're saying.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.345
"Ray did it" is what they say.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.765
So if you let me help you,
I want to help you.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.644
You get these fucking kids back,
get the hell out of here.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.355
Deal?

28:14.776 --> 28:17.529
You give something, you get something.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.617
This lady got herself raped
in the park last night.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.744
Now Kevin, he's saying it's you.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.580
But you see that scratch?

28:28.123 --> 28:30.125
She scratched him
when she was fighting him off.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.793
So what do you think happened?

28:40.802 --> 28:41.845
Kevin did it.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.681
[tearfully] No, they're lying on me.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.015
How'd this happen?

28:46.683 --> 28:49.519
You want to explain that?
Where'd you get that scratch?

28:51.563 --> 28:53.982
It was the lady when you was raping her,
right?

28:54.315 --> 28:56.651
When you were shoving your dick
right into her.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.069
[detective 2] Whoa! Fuck!

28:59.320 --> 29:00.739
Wanna talk proper?

29:01.281 --> 29:02.365
Hm?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.784
You think you're gonna bullshit me?

29:05.618 --> 29:08.705
[detective 1] You're not gonna
bullshit me. I could do this all day.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.373
-I told you...
-[detective 1] He's your boy!

29:10.457 --> 29:11.958
...I went in the park with Eddie--

29:12.041 --> 29:13.668
[detective 2]
That's a story and we know it.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.836
Antron McCray.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.505
He was involved.
What was Antron doing?

29:22.051 --> 29:23.094
Antone...

29:25.346 --> 29:27.182
held her down, I guess.

29:28.683 --> 29:29.601
"Antron."

29:31.436 --> 29:35.690
He is 14 years old! Wait a second.
He's 14! You're talking about my little...

29:35.774 --> 29:36.941
He's a little baby!

29:37.025 --> 29:38.568
Give me a second, okay?

29:38.651 --> 29:40.945
They're calling me Antron! Mom!
He's calling me Antron.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.615
-No, all my friends call me Tronny.
-Give me five seconds...

29:43.698 --> 29:45.992
-[detective] Mrs. McCray...
-[argument continues]

29:46.075 --> 29:48.828
-[Antron] Hey!
-What are they talking about?

29:48.912 --> 29:50.079
What is going on?

29:50.163 --> 29:52.040
[Antron] Wait, wait, wait!

29:52.123 --> 29:54.793
-[argument continuing]
-[detective] Okay, I understand.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.795
-[man] It's cool.
-[detective] Calm down.

29:56.878 --> 29:57.712
[Antron] Hey!

29:58.254 --> 29:59.798
[detective] We need to take her out.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.132
-Step outside, please.
-[Antron] Ma!

30:01.549 --> 30:02.592
[door closes]

30:03.426 --> 30:05.970
[detective 1] Sit. You stay down.

30:07.013 --> 30:10.099
What did you do when you saw the lady?
What did you first do?

30:10.183 --> 30:11.142
[Antron sobs]

30:11.226 --> 30:13.019
[detective 1]
Did you touch her down there?

30:13.144 --> 30:15.730
-Okay? It's okay.
-[Antron] No, I didn't.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.482
I told you. I...

30:18.149 --> 30:19.776
I ain't seen no lady.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.320
[detective 1]
Raymond Santana saw you rape her.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.864
-Who is he?
-Don't you fucking raise your voice to me!

30:24.948 --> 30:28.451
All right? Just because you don't know him
doesn't mean he didn't see you.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.954
Antron, everybody's saying
that you did this!

30:31.037 --> 30:32.038
[father] Excuse me.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.085
You think there's someone I can talk to?

30:38.294 --> 30:39.629
I don't know those boys...

30:40.588 --> 30:43.466
and I don't know what they're saying,
but I know my son.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.844
Ain't no way he did this.

30:45.969 --> 30:46.886
No way, right?

30:46.970 --> 30:49.848
See, he's a good boy
and we raised him, right?

30:50.139 --> 30:52.225
He don't know nothing about sex
or nothing.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.102
Straight up, he didn't do no rape.

30:55.311 --> 30:58.523
He ain't got no experience.
The boy won't even talk to girls yet.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.400
You know what I'm saying.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.069
Soon,
that's all he's gonna be talking about.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.487
Yeah.
[chuckles]

31:16.833 --> 31:18.376
How long you been at Imperial?

31:21.546 --> 31:22.797
About five years now.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.008
That's a good job.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.509
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.678
Good benefits, good pay.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.224
Your supervisor know about your past,
Bobby?

31:36.477 --> 31:39.355
I mean, he knows I ain't been no trouble
since I been there.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.648
Five years.

31:41.482 --> 31:43.067
He knows you did time, right?

31:46.905 --> 31:48.072
I mean, it really...

31:48.156 --> 31:50.241
It don't really matter
'cause that's behind me now.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.826
I ain't been in no trouble.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.369
Maybe not, huh?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.585
Why don't you talk some sense
into your kid?

32:04.297 --> 32:06.507
We both want him to go home tonight,
right?

32:08.343 --> 32:09.177
Right?

32:11.220 --> 32:12.931
-Yeah.
-Get up!

32:24.776 --> 32:25.777
[sighs]

32:34.285 --> 32:35.119
Hey.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.537
What's up, boy?

32:37.372 --> 32:38.289
You all right?

32:40.458 --> 32:41.376
Hey...

32:43.962 --> 32:45.588
[whispering] Listen to me, Tron.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.383
I need you to do what the police...

32:49.342 --> 32:50.551
want you to do.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.554
You gotta say what they want you to say.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.307
-But they want me to lie.
-Don't think of it like that.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.851
Just say what they want you to say.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.857
Dad, I ain't rape no lady.

33:04.941 --> 33:05.775
Tron...

33:06.275 --> 33:10.154
I'm trying to tell you what you need to do
to get your ass up out of here.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.448
-But you're not listening to me.
-I ain't do this.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.117
Doesn't matter. You gotta listen to me.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.036
Tron, listen to me.
Don't fucking backtalk me.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.163
-You're not listening--
-[yells] Goddamn it!

33:20.707 --> 33:22.291
Why you not listening to me?

33:29.799 --> 33:32.176
Tron, these police will mess us up.

33:32.552 --> 33:33.720
They're not playing.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.722
They're not.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.433
Look...

33:39.308 --> 33:42.603
when the police want what they want,
they will do anything.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.565
Do you hear me? Anything.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.109
They'll lie on us.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.029
They will lock us up.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.365
They will kill us.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.869
I ain't gonna let them kill my son.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.082
But you don't know nothing about that yet.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.754
But you <i>will </i>do what they say.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.007
You will go along. Do you understand me?

34:14.594 --> 34:15.845
[yells] Do you understand me?

34:17.013 --> 34:17.930
Yes, sir.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.651
[door opens]
[Antron clears his throat]

34:40.203 --> 34:41.829
[detective] Tell me about the lady.

34:45.917 --> 34:51.255
[Sheehan]
Trisha Meili lives East 83rd Street.

34:51.339 --> 34:54.759
Her boyfriend says he spoke to her
on the phone at 9:00 p.m.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.512
His assistant in the office
placed the call for them.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.765
They talk and she leaves
to go out jogging.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.227
She's downstairs at 9:05.

35:05.186 --> 35:10.149
And she says hi to the doorman
and takes off on her regular run,

35:10.233 --> 35:12.318
<i>north on East Drive.</i>

35:13.611 --> 35:16.572
<i>Her boyfriend says</i>
<i>she's an experienced runner.</i>

35:17.406 --> 35:19.408
-[beeping]
<i>-She does a steady eight-minute mile.</i>

35:20.201 --> 35:22.245
<i>She goes in at 88th Street.</i>

35:23.454 --> 35:24.831
<i>Eight minutes per mile.</i>

35:25.498 --> 35:30.461
<i>It's 9:15 when she gets to the place</i>
<i>where she's dragged off the road.</i>

35:35.174 --> 35:37.135
[Fairstein]
<i>That's a 45-minute discrepancy.</i>

35:38.553 --> 35:40.805
We could pull the rape up to 9:20.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.349
You know, maybe she stopped
to tie her shoes or something?

35:43.432 --> 35:46.352
No, it's still out of whack.
How can these same kids be raping her

35:46.435 --> 35:48.855
at the same time they're
jumping bicyclists way over there?

35:48.938 --> 35:51.941
Nothing on the weapon,
question marks on the timeline.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.193
I mean, we got problems.

35:58.239 --> 36:01.367
Sheehan, what do you think about the,
you know,

36:01.450 --> 36:04.162
"I got lost in the ball field" bullshit
we keep hearing about?

36:04.245 --> 36:05.997
-I never liked that.
-Yeah, me neither.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.916
If there's no ball field, they have
plenty of time to attack and rape her.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.877
-What, change the order?
-[woman] Yeah.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.588
Oh, so they go to the reservoir last.

36:14.088 --> 36:16.007
Is there enough time for all this
to even happen?

36:16.507 --> 36:19.302
Well, it happened, so obviously there was.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.727
[Santana] I came home for dinner,
and I thought Ray would be home by...

36:28.060 --> 36:29.020
Uh...

36:31.981 --> 36:32.899
[door closes]

36:32.982 --> 36:34.942
What's going....
What's going on with my son?

36:35.026 --> 36:35.985
Where's my mother?

36:36.068 --> 36:37.653
We almost finished here, Pop.

36:38.112 --> 36:40.156
-[Hartigan] Come on, sit down.
-What's going on?

36:40.239 --> 36:41.782
I mean, nobody told me nothing.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.284
-I got it.
-[Santana] Almost finished with what?

36:43.367 --> 36:45.161
-What's going on here?
-Don't worry about it.
Are you okay?
[in Spanish] What did you do?

36:48.372 --> 36:49.498
[in English] I got it.

36:51.751 --> 36:52.752
[Hartigan] Okay, so...

36:53.002 --> 36:55.671
So, Antron held her down
while Kevin was raping her, right?

36:55.755 --> 36:57.256
Wait, what are you talking about?
-Pop, stop.
-What are you talking about, rape?

36:58.925 --> 37:01.135
Your son was witness to a rape
in Central Park.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.014
So Antron was raping her.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.265
Now, what were you doing?

37:06.474 --> 37:08.017
-Nothing.
-[Hartigan] Oh, come on, Ray.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.394
No one will believe a kid like you
would just stand there.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.687
You gotta put yourself in there.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.315
No, wait a minute. What do you mean,
"put yourself in there"?

37:14.398 --> 37:15.816
-Pop, stop.
-[Hartigan] He was there.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.110
-You didn't hear what he just said?
-Pop, stop.

37:18.903 --> 37:19.904
I made a deal.

37:31.582 --> 37:34.043
Okay. Now, she was hit pretty hard.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.670
Okay, so who hit her?

37:36.671 --> 37:37.505
Kevin.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.593
[Hartigan] Come on, relax.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.553
[handcuffs rattling]

37:44.637 --> 37:46.555
Let's take a break from these, huh?

37:56.399 --> 37:58.484
What do you like to do after school, kid?

38:01.946 --> 38:03.322
I play... I play trumpet.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.783
[Hartigan] Wow! That ain't easy.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.161
And you want to keep playing, right?

38:10.204 --> 38:11.622
Get to be as good as Miles?

38:12.373 --> 38:14.125
You don't want to throw all that away.

38:15.584 --> 38:16.836
You seem like a good kid.

38:18.212 --> 38:19.171
Just got caught up

38:19.714 --> 38:21.173
going with the wrong group.

38:22.591 --> 38:23.509
That's normal.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.178
Kevin.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.264
You tell me...

38:29.473 --> 38:30.433
what you know

38:31.225 --> 38:32.435
about Antron

38:33.144 --> 38:34.103
and Raymond
and that lady...

38:37.648 --> 38:39.025
that's the road to home.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.069
You help me,

38:42.611 --> 38:43.654
I'll help you.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.122
[Hartigan]<i> Kevin.</i>

38:53.914 --> 38:54.915
<i>Now, the lady...</i>

38:55.708 --> 38:57.626
<i>she was in jogging clothes, right?</i>

38:58.919 --> 39:01.047
-Yeah.
-[Hartigan] So, what was she wearing?

39:01.714 --> 39:02.548
Um...

39:03.966 --> 39:05.468
Um, jogging clothes.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.553
<i>-Um...</i>
-[inaudible]

39:07.678 --> 39:09.930
[Kevin] <i>Like a blouse and...</i>

39:10.014 --> 39:11.682
Um, like... I mean, uh...

39:12.099 --> 39:14.143
No, I mean, like a tank top

39:14.852 --> 39:15.853
and, um...

39:16.979 --> 39:20.232
And... Yeah, like a tank top
and, like, some shorts.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.361
[Hartigan] Who took off her shirt?
Let's go by who was there.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.657
Raymond?

39:30.284 --> 39:31.202
Antron?

39:32.119 --> 39:33.120
Was it Antron?

39:35.456 --> 39:37.833
Um, yeah. Yeah.

39:37.917 --> 39:38.959
Yeah, Antron, yeah.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.879
[Hartigan] So Antron, he ripped off
her shirt. Did he touch her boobies?

39:44.715 --> 39:45.758
Who spread her legs?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.053
Hm, um...

39:49.136 --> 39:51.347
-[Hartigan] What was Raymond doing?
-Raymond?

39:51.639 --> 39:52.848
Raymond, um, yeah.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.642
[Hartigan] And who was on top?

39:55.309 --> 39:56.977
So what was Antron doing again?

39:57.436 --> 40:01.440
After he ripped off her shirt,
then he was raping her, Kevin.

40:02.024 --> 40:04.902
And then Antron got on top.

40:06.028 --> 40:09.615
[Hartigan] Now, what were you doing? Hm?
How did she scratch you?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.201
Hm?

40:12.326 --> 40:13.577
It was, like...

40:14.328 --> 40:16.956
I came over to...

40:18.207 --> 40:21.752
to where, like,
to where everybody was at and where...

40:22.044 --> 40:24.046
like, the lady was at and, um...

40:25.631 --> 40:28.134
and I was like trying to stop it, like...

40:28.759 --> 40:31.095
like, "Hey, stop."
Like, I was trying to...

40:31.512 --> 40:33.931
like, trying to help her out. Um...

40:35.599 --> 40:37.560
Uh, and then like...

40:38.352 --> 40:41.147
I think she...
I mean, no, she scratched me.

40:42.022 --> 40:42.857
And...

40:44.024 --> 40:46.902
Yeah. She...
She scratched me when I came over.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.863
I was trying to stop...
and she scratched me.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.282
And, yeah, that's how I got the scratch.

40:59.707 --> 41:00.541
Okay.

41:03.043 --> 41:05.504
So, I'm gonna bring someone in here.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.090
And we're gonna write
some of this stuff down.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.968
<i>Let's get your sister in here,</i>
<i>get you out of this room.</i>

41:17.933 --> 41:20.644
We talked about a lot of things.
It's all in there.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.062
-Right.
-Can I see it?

41:22.146 --> 41:23.022
Sure.
This...

41:31.739 --> 41:34.241
-He didn't even write this. This isn't--
-No, he dictated it.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.041
Who are these boys?

41:42.833 --> 41:44.251
I never heard of these boys.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.214
Wha... "Touched her boobs"?

41:49.256 --> 41:51.342
-Kevin--
-No. No, Angie. No.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.970
-I didn't do anything--
-Then why you say that you did do it?

41:55.054 --> 41:56.222
I didn't do that, Angie.

41:57.139 --> 41:59.391
He's telling you
that he didn't see nothing.

41:59.475 --> 42:02.394
Why are you making him sign this
when he's telling you he saw nothing?

42:02.478 --> 42:05.022
You gotta put at the bottom,
"I'm the one that didn't do the rape."

42:05.105 --> 42:07.900
Okay, we'll do that.
You gotta sign right here.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.401
All right?

42:09.610 --> 42:11.946
-I'm not signing this.
-Angie, please sign it.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.114
[Sheehan]
You wanna take your brother home or not?

42:14.198 --> 42:15.574
-Yes.
-'Cause we can keep him.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.076
-No...
-[Hartigan] Angie...

42:17.159 --> 42:19.286
-Kev, I can't sign--
-[Kevin] Please, just sign it.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.081
[Hartigan] Angie, just because
you waive an attorney right now,

42:22.623 --> 42:24.667
it doesn't mean it's forever, right?

42:24.750 --> 42:26.919
-I don't even--
-You get your brother home.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.088
You and your mother figure things out
with a lawyer...

42:29.171 --> 42:32.633
-I have to figure this out.
-I don't wanna stay here anymore.

42:32.758 --> 42:35.302
[tearfully] I'm tired of being here.
I don't wanna be here anymore.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.637
Please sign it.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.889
[Hartigan] We don't wanna
be here doing this.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.015
I wanna go home.

42:40.099 --> 42:43.143
-Okay.
-[Kevin] Angie, I wanna go home.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.854
-I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.
-[Angie] Okay.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.982
I don't wanna be here.
[sobbing]

42:48.065 --> 42:49.149
Okay.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.152
I got you. I got you.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.573
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.533
[Sheehan] The Richardsons
and the McCrays have signed.

42:57.616 --> 43:00.452
-The boys are in Holding.
-[Fairstein] We still gotta tape 'em.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.497
Those are grass stains?

43:03.706 --> 43:06.292
-That's right, Counselor.
-Be sure to get that, okay?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.420
[phone ringing]

43:11.422 --> 43:12.548
-Hello.
<i>-It's Gina.</i>

43:12.631 --> 43:14.341
<i>I just talked to Jim</i>
<i>down at the barbershop.</i>

43:14.425 --> 43:16.844
<i>He say he saw them rounding up boys</i>
<i>in the neighborhood earlier.</i>

43:16.927 --> 43:18.637
<i>Yusef got picked up by the police!</i>

43:18.721 --> 43:19.805
The police?

43:20.097 --> 43:22.308
<i>He said the cops were</i>
<i>from the 24th Precinct.</i>

43:23.809 --> 43:25.227
All right, all right, okay.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.230
Ms. Salaam, it's too late.

43:28.314 --> 43:29.481
He waived the attorney.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.650
He can't do that.

43:31.984 --> 43:34.903
-He's a minor.
-His legal ID says he's 16.

43:34.987 --> 43:36.280
My son is 15.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.782
Can I see the birth certificate?

43:48.167 --> 43:49.209
You know what?

43:50.711 --> 43:53.047
I think I'll actually call
<i>The New York Times.</i>

43:54.131 --> 43:59.011
And inform them that you are knowingly
interrogating an unaccompanied minor

44:00.012 --> 44:01.430
in defiance of his mother.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.101
-You're gonna call the <i>Times?</i>
<i>-The New York Times, </i>yes.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.269
Are you already

44:07.728 --> 44:10.064
interrogating my son back there
without me?

44:11.857 --> 44:13.317
He is too young for that.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.485
He is a minor.

44:14.568 --> 44:16.945
You can't stop us
from interrogating a suspect.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.156
-Who do you think you are?
-I'm his mother.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.450
And I'm stopping this.

44:21.950 --> 44:24.953
I'm stopping this right now.
Right now. I want to see my son.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.331
I want to see my son right now.
Right now!

44:28.999 --> 44:31.960
-[detective 1] Up here. Sign this.
-[detective 2] Come on. Wake up and--

44:32.044 --> 44:33.170
[detective 1] Sign this.

44:33.253 --> 44:35.214
First and last name, right there,
top line. Go ahead.

44:35.297 --> 44:37.299
-Finish writing it.
-What are you doing?

44:38.676 --> 44:40.928
[detective 2]
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

44:45.015 --> 44:47.017
The door just opens now? Fuck.

44:50.646 --> 44:51.689
I'm here, son.

44:52.648 --> 44:53.565
I'm here.

44:54.858 --> 44:55.859
Look at me.

44:59.029 --> 44:59.905
Are you hurt?
Are you?

45:02.032 --> 45:03.826
No. No.

45:13.919 --> 45:14.837
[mother] What is that?

45:15.212 --> 45:16.255
Miranda card.

45:16.922 --> 45:18.882
He waived his right to an attorney.

45:19.425 --> 45:20.926
We're not waiving any rights.

45:27.933 --> 45:32.980
You left a child unaccompanied
by a guardian

45:33.480 --> 45:36.859
or a lawyer with these men in this room,

45:37.609 --> 45:38.819
for hours!
Shame on you.

45:42.906 --> 45:47.369
[sorrowful music playing]

46:03.552 --> 46:04.386
[detective] Wait.

46:05.471 --> 46:06.346
Wait.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.099
His dad needs to sign this too.

46:12.811 --> 46:13.854
Here's a pen.

46:27.659 --> 46:29.787
The quicker you sign,
the quicker we get out of here.

46:38.879 --> 46:41.298
You know, my son ain't eat
since yesterday.

46:41.381 --> 46:42.925
It's been 18 hours
since you brung him here.

46:43.008 --> 46:45.135
-Can I go get him some food now?
-[detective sighs]

46:45.219 --> 46:47.888
You got about five minutes,
then I'm taking him to Holding.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.265
-Okay?
-Where can I get some food around here?

46:51.225 --> 46:52.518
Tell him to get a lawyer.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.096
Whatever they said I did...

47:31.598 --> 47:32.558
I didn't.

47:33.892 --> 47:35.227
I know, I know.

47:35.894 --> 47:37.479
I know, I know, I know.

47:48.490 --> 47:52.035
-[Fairstein] Counselor Lederer. Morning.
-Hi.

47:54.496 --> 47:56.248
[Fairstein]
Here's the latest on the new case.

47:56.331 --> 47:58.333
I've been up working on this all night.

48:04.590 --> 48:05.424
[Lederer] Okay.

48:06.091 --> 48:09.553
When these kids are given the facts
of the first bicycle assaults,

48:09.636 --> 48:13.932
we see moments where their stories
actually align with each other.

48:14.433 --> 48:17.561
-When we arrive at the rape--
-Yeah. Then they all start lying.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.855
Lying? Try five different versions.

48:21.523 --> 48:25.694
Okay, you've got Raymond saying,
"It wasn't me. It was Kevin."

48:25.777 --> 48:28.363
Kevin saying,
"Not me, it was Antron who did it."

48:29.031 --> 48:31.074
And then Antron goes...

48:31.158 --> 48:34.536
"Oh, wait, it was some mysterious
tall black guy who assaulted her."

48:34.620 --> 48:35.913
And then he doubles down

48:35.996 --> 48:38.206
and has the whole cast of characters
raping her.

48:38.290 --> 48:39.833
Except for himself,

48:40.208 --> 48:44.171
who pulled out his penis
and only pretended to rape her.

48:46.548 --> 48:47.716
[exhales in disbelief]

48:48.467 --> 48:51.011
I've gotta face a judge
and prosecute this, Linda.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.137
What is your case?
Our case...

48:54.806 --> 48:56.099
is they're all guilty.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.895
Each of these boys
assaulted Patricia Meili.

49:00.437 --> 49:02.814
They all raped her.

49:03.649 --> 49:07.861
And we know this because
in each of these boys' confessions,

49:07.945 --> 49:10.781
they all bear eyewitness
against each other.

49:13.575 --> 49:14.618
You think it's weak.

49:16.495 --> 49:19.206
I'm imagining myself
walking into that courtroom

49:19.456 --> 49:22.668
armed with a stack
of wildly conflicting statements,

49:22.751 --> 49:24.962
no physical evidence, no weapon.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.339
All we need is for one
of these little shits
