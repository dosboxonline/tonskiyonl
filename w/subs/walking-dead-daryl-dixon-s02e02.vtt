**

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.811
The idea of home takes on
a different meaning for Daryl.

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:48.979
And I think these relationships
start to form

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.848
and these connections are made.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.249
And what we see in
season two

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.284
is that has deepened a bit,

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:57.321
and you absolutely see Isabelle,
Daryl and Laurent

01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:59.123
as a family unit.

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:00.624
Cricket again.

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:03.293
No, it's baseball,
American baseball.

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:05.162
We need a catcher.
I'll be a catcher.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.431
Alright, we got a catcher.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:10.267
The baseball
scene was so much fun.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.102
It was one of those scenes
that you kind of like ad-lib

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.804
as you go, you know?

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.706
It's written Laurent knocks
the first ball

01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:17.274
out of the park or whatever.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.377
Yeah, yeah, take 30.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.146
[Cheering]

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:23.447
Yeah!

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:26.984
Scigliuzzi: My grandfather used
to play baseball for Italy,

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:28.853
but besides that,
I never played.

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:31.388
He got really good.
He's like, "I never played
baseball before."

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.290
And then he's like pow.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:35.125
[Cheering]

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:37.661
We actually just got
to witness Louis realizing

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:39.864
he was really good at baseball.
[Laughs]

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.799
Reedus: That scene was
really fun to film

01:01:41.799 --> 01:01:43.734
because it was so loose.

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:45.936
You know, sometimes the loose
ones are the best, you know?

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:47.872
Don't worry,
when the water goes back out,

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:51.275
we'll go in
and get him.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.777
And then we'll go
with you.

01:01:52.777 --> 01:01:54.544
If the offer
still stands.

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:56.680
Zabel: From the beginning,

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.715
there was always the hope
that there would feel

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:01.351
like a dynamic chemistry
between the two of them.

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:04.288
But it wasn't a given,
and it wasn't a necessity.

01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:07.491
And of course, it happened,
and so it made sense to us

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:11.695
to want to give
that more visual realization.

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:17.301
*

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.870
Poésy: Oh my God,
we shot this scene on a day

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.339
where the tide was really low,

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:26.443
and it just brought in
an incredible amount of insects.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:30.480
So the only thing
we were really worried about

01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:34.018
were all the insects
on each other's faces.

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:35.752
Reedus: You know,
and then the wind's blowing.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.087
And at one point
she's looking at me

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.989
and she looks over to kiss me

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:41.826
and my hair is just in
my face like this,

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:43.327
and I can read on her mind.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.428
She's like, how am I going
to get through

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:45.963
that hair to his mouth?

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:47.597
And then there's
mosquitoes like, you know,

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.900
flying in our mouths
and, you know,

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:53.337
bouncing off our faces during
this big romantic sunset moment.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:55.639
But she's a trooper,
and it was still fun.

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:57.774
And the scene came out
super beautiful.

01:02:57.908 --> 01:03:00.310
[Engine rumbling]

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:03.113
Woman: Welcome to Greenland.

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:04.849
Ash: People.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:05.749
Zabel: We went to
a lot of beautiful places

01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:07.751
on this show,

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:09.186
but I have to say the French
Alps is right up there,

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:11.721
top two or three
of the beautiful places we went.

01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:14.959
Selfishly, I will say,
I thought we're in France,

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.994
so we should shoot
in the French Alps.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.762
And if we can't shoot the
French Alps as the French Alps,

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.065
then maybe we can shoot
the French Alps' Greenland.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:22.933
McBride: The drive up
to get to the French Alps,

01:03:23.067 --> 01:03:25.502
it was beautiful.
The visuals were stunning.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.939
And then to see the drone shots
when they go over the mountains

01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:32.542
and these huge vistas were
incredible.

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:34.778
[Speaking in native language]

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:55.399
I got this.

01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:57.267
You work
on the fuel leak.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:58.903
Zabel: We have
a big walker sequence there

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:01.305
to-- also difficult trying
to create

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.307
how we get those walkers
to emerge out

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:05.275
of the ground and stuff.

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:09.980
Nicotero: We wanted to go back
to these archaeological digs

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.250
where they found these bodies
buried, like these bog people.

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:16.053
So I said,
I think it would be really fun

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:19.456
if we went for a different look
with these walkers,

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:22.859
that their skin looked more
preserved and more mummified,

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:25.262
and taking the foliage
and the growth

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.564
that was on
the mountainside there,

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:30.234
incorporating it
into the makeups.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.436
[Walkers growling]

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:37.174
Alright,
Spotted at least two of them.

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:40.177
There's only one way in.
Alright, follow me.

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:42.012
Zabel: Episode two
is called "Moulin Rouge,"

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.281
which of course
the Moulin Rouge is a famous

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:47.551
French attraction and tourist
site that a lot of people know.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:49.886
A big red windmill
in Montmartre.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.390
In English it means red mill,
and in episode two,

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:57.427
the culminating events
largely occur inside a mill

01:04:57.527 --> 01:05:02.566
which turns very violent
and bloody.

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.202
So in our show,
it's-- it's a bloody mill.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.604
Behind the scenes.
There we go, clap!

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:11.375
*

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:14.444
This isn't Moulin,
but it's a water mill.

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.513
It's a beautiful
old factory.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.715
A ground grain,
it's a complete ruin.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.884
It's hard to find
complete ruins anymore.

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:23.153
We're having
a lot of fun chasing zombies.

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.655
in this show, and this today,

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:28.558
we're going to have
a different kind of fight

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:30.494
because it's the fight
with the traitors.

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:32.762
Poésy: The stunt team
has worked out a choreography,

01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:36.533
then we come in
and see how that works for us.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:39.236
Ebouaney: We already trained
for that fight.

01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:41.738
I've got a sword fight,
I've got a fist fight

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.640
and strangulation
and stuff like that.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.742
It's going to be fun, yeah.

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:49.379
I might kill someone today.
[Laughs]

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.681
The ambush in the, uh,
in the windmill.

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.150
I remember throwing a guy
out a window.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.518
That was fun.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.186
Man: Three, two, one,
action!

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:59.156
*

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.825
[Applause]

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.793
Reedus: A lot of times, like,
you'll fight

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.163
and it'll look really cool,
but the ground's uneven.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.999
It's kind of tight spaces,
the stairs.

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.800
So many stairs in France.

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:12.369
So to do the choreography
for a fight scene

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.371
sometimes gets kind of cramped.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.206
It looks great,
and you'd never know on camera.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.208
It's a little harder
to do, you know,

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.377
than in a big
flat room.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.379
*

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:24.448
Carol: Where are we?

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.051
That's France down there.

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:30.187
Zabel: I was really excited
to get Carol to France,

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.823
but I also didn't want
it to seem too easy.

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:35.659
But yeah,
once she gets to France

01:06:35.759 --> 01:06:37.527
and once she walks into Paris,
that was super cool.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.163
I was super psyched about that,
because also it allowed us

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.165
to see a part of Paris

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:42.966
we had not seen on the show,
which is La Défense

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:45.135
which is sort of the other
end of Champs-Élysées,

01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:46.636
opposite of Arc de Triomphe.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.472
And so it's kind of cool
to see her walk

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:50.707
into the deteriorated
modern Paris.

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:53.610
Nicotero: I think in season one,
what was really successful

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:57.047
was seeing Daryl
on his journey.

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:01.285
She doesn't have the
same experience that Daryl did.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.953
She sort of lands
and is kind of caught

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.655
right up in the middle of it,

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.791
but from a different
perspective.

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:09.459
Carol doesn't know who
the good guys are

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:11.361
and who the bad guys are yet.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:13.430
So I think, you know,
knowing how clever she is

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:15.832
and how easily it is

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:19.669
for her to ferret out what's
happening in the situation,

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.771
it was exciting to see

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:25.875
how she does it
in a completely strange world

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.812
with all new people
and strange situations.

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:31.348
You've heard of Marion Genet?

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.283
No.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:36.353
She's trying to start
over, the New France.

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:44.761
*

01:07:46.563 --> 01:08:14.858
*
