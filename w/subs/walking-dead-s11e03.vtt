WEBVTT

00:12.095 --> 00:13.430
Run!

00:49.424 --> 00:50.717
Elijah!

00:51.134 --> 00:52.427
No!

02:37.699 --> 02:41.828
- See you in 30.
- Kel. Kel, Kel.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.749
I missed you this morning.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.252
Thought we had a shift together.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.046
 Sorry. Something came up.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.425
You still want to do
those shifts with me?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.760
It's okay if you don't.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.888
Next one. I promise.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.016
Kel.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.976
Do you...

03:05.768 --> 03:07.437
Do you wanna talk about it?

03:10.273 --> 03:11.900
Nothing to talk about.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.706
Come on. Everyone... Pull!

03:49.687 --> 03:52.440
Hey. Going somewhere?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.484
We need to get our horses back.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.152
You see the east wall when you came in?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.570
I did.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.697
You were marked down to help today.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.783
Looks like you've got a crew already.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.953
Well, you were gone all morning.
We started without you.

04:05.119 --> 04:06.996
I'm sorry, Aaron. I can't today.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.582
 Because you're tracking horses

04:09.666 --> 04:11.834
that you have almost no hope of catching?

04:12.377 --> 04:14.420
You know, Daryl and I went
down that road before.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.506
Didn't work out so well for Buttons.

04:18.258 --> 04:22.095
We're almost out of MREs,
and the fields are a joke...

04:22.262 --> 04:23.930
And our walls are about to fail.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.640
Well, if we don't get those horses,

04:25.640 --> 04:27.892
we're not gonna be able
to move anything heavier

04:27.976 --> 04:29.227
than a sack of grain.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.523
Or go out far enough to scavenge anything,
and we're all gonna starve to death.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.777
So I'll be back in a few hours.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.372
I'm hungry, too.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.502
Do you ever worry about
your mom when she goes away?

04:54.502 --> 04:56.212
I'm used to it.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.881
Grown-ups are always
running off doing things.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.468
"Promise I'll see you soon. Love you."

05:07.223 --> 05:09.892
They used to say that kind of stuff
in the olden times, right?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.687
They can't promise it now,
but they say it anyways.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.149
They don't want us to think
they're never coming back.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.651
It's supposed to make us feel better.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.696
They say it to make
themselves feel better.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.866
Still...

05:25.158 --> 05:26.743
My mom always comes back.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.412
Yeah.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.837
Dang it.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.753
Lord, you are my refuge
and my strength...

09:48.921 --> 09:50.798
My refuge and my strength...

09:51.757 --> 09:52.967
My refuge...

11:20.096 --> 11:21.430
Alden.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.057
Maggie.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.664
Jesus.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.167
Let me see?

12:31.417 --> 12:32.918
Sure thing, boss.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.842
That good, huh?

12:40.259 --> 12:41.802
You think you can walk?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.679
Not gonna know until we try.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.764
Whoa, whoa.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.807
You're not seriously
thinking that we keep going.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.476
They'll be back.
We gotta keep moving.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.644
Alright, wait.
What exactly is the plan here?

12:51.479 --> 12:54.148
The plan doesn't change.
We need that food.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.233
We get to the radio tower,
find the supply house,

12:56.317 --> 12:57.610
and wait for the others.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.570
And what if the others are dead?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.907
Listen, I know theatrics.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.368
Those people, they just told us
exactly how insane they are.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.912
We can't be on a road.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.915
We can't be on any road
that they could use.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.124
It's a shit plan.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.461
Then you tell me a better one
that doesn't starve us all.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.464
Right.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.508
I am on your side, Maggie.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.176
Then help me with him.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.766
Two, three, go.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.424
No.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.553
Not unless you want Coco
tripping the light fantastic.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.430
Yeah, but just for like
a week, tops, right?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.434
- You good?
- Yeah.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.062
Yeah, it's just that
Gabriel's on a mission,

14:15.062 --> 14:17.189
and I'm over being stuck in the house.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.651
Why? What're you guys doing?

14:38.335 --> 14:39.545
Wait.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.775
Damn it!

15:02.818 --> 15:04.153
Fourth time's the charm.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.113
Let's get a move on.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.372
You okay?

15:15.956 --> 15:17.541
I'll be better when this is done.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.965
I've been having dreams
about Abraham recently.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.383
Yeah?

15:26.467 --> 15:28.177
Yeah, he's trying to tell me something.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.597
I know it's something important,
something I'm supposed to do.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.976
But I can't hear him most of the time,
and just when I'm about to...

15:36.393 --> 15:38.938
He, um... He gets shot in the head.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.024
Well, that's dark.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.234
Yeah, I don't know why
I just told you that.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.528
No, I get it.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.489
It used to freak me out,

15:48.489 --> 15:50.950
but now I think it's a message for us,
for Alexandria.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.203
What do you think he's trying to say?

15:54.203 --> 15:55.621
I don't know.

15:55.913 --> 16:00.501
You know, if a horse
lets you touch its ear,

16:01.251 --> 16:03.003
it means it trusts you.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.339
I read that once.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.300
You think we'll get them back?

16:09.885 --> 16:11.971
Horses are wild creatures.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.264
You never know.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.691
It's two miles.
It's further than I thought.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.695
We better get moving.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.030
Holding your hand's not gonna
help me walk any faster.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.615
Yeah? Does the thought
of one of those things

16:31.699 --> 16:33.242
ripping your face off do it for you?

16:33.701 --> 16:37.413
If you're scared, why don't you
make yourself useful and go kill 'em?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.461
Really? So we're just gonna go
towards the screaming?

16:45.170 --> 16:46.630
Cool.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.477
Agatha!

17:05.941 --> 17:07.943
Maggie. It's Duncan.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.879
Duncan.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.104
Duncan.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.525
I'm so sorry.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.862
For all of it.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.199
Why?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.826
We were good.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.662
We were lucky.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.292
For a little while.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.925
Make sure she gets home.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.094
Promise.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.311
This way.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.213
No.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.924
No.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.302
It can't be.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.345
It's okay.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.644
We'll keep looking for the rest.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.521
They'll stay close to the water.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.399
Not if it's full of corpses they won't.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.151
Carol, it's getting late.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.822
She's right.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.992
We don't have to do this right now.
Let's come back tomorrow.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.078
No, Alexandria needed
these horses yesterday.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.708
Carol...

20:28.936 --> 20:30.270
Let's go home.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.582
We'll try again.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.417
Next time.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.713
Hey.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.590
Maybe not.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.657
Dope.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.915
They're headed towards
the dairy farm.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.294
- And?
- The dairy farm's got paddocks.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.088
We can pen them in.
Come on. Let's go.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.144
Easy now. Easy now.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.115
Drop the lassos.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.367
Why?

22:07.826 --> 22:09.202
Just do it.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.132
They're not running.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.595
I think they want to come home.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.644
Hey.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.027
Whoa.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.503
Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

22:59.711 --> 23:02.881
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

23:04.007 --> 23:07.219
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

23:08.095 --> 23:11.973
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.358
You move slower
than I thought you would.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.946
Don't be scared.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.366
I'm not.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.578
We have been blessed.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.249
I...

23:37.499 --> 23:39.042
I have been blessed.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.796
You have a funny definition
of blessed.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.217
But it is you who has come for me.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.178
Will you pray for me?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.601
You tried to kill my friends.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.855
Yes.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.607
And they tried to kill me.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.652
Pray for me.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.030
Even your enemies deserve that much.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.287
I thought you were a man of God.

24:24.921 --> 24:26.756
God isn't here anymore.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.853
Twice as many as before.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.481
We need to rethink your plan, Maggie.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.234
You're a free man, Negan.
You wanna go?

24:46.776 --> 24:47.944
Go.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.113
I can help you.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.741
You know, your friends, they trusted me.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.160
You were gone for a long time.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.913
Things change. People change.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.332
No.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.084
Maybe you've got them fooled,
but not me.

25:05.128 --> 25:08.131
Stop pretending
you're one of us, Negan.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.675
Maybe you even believe it.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.552
But you're probably as good
at lying to yourself

25:12.636 --> 25:14.429
as you are to everybody else.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.115
You okay, Maggie?

25:34.658 --> 25:35.825
Yeah.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.536
I can handle Negan.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.705
I wasn't talking about Negan.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.547
This can't be what you thought
you'd be coming home to.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.716
It can't be what you told
Hershel he'd see.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.053
You know, not much surprises me anymore.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.390
Except Hilltop.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.184
It's not the place I told Hershel about.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.852
Hold on a sec.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.990
You know, I'm not sure much
surprises him anymore, either.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.664
You'll build it back up,
better than it was before.

26:23.456 --> 26:24.916
We will.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.419
Sure.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.296
We'll get it done.

26:30.630 --> 26:33.425
At least by the time
that Adam is old enough to remember.

26:35.135 --> 26:38.346
I leave here for one minute,
and you're raising a kid.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.225
Maggie, if I, uh...

26:42.309 --> 26:44.144
We'll start when we get back, okay?

26:48.398 --> 26:52.277
The good news is,
he lives in Alexandria, so...

26:53.236 --> 26:54.988
- Small wins.
- Mm-hmm.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.788
What the hell?

27:30.482 --> 27:32.108
This way. Come on!

27:44.037 --> 27:45.080
Let's go.

27:51.753 --> 27:52.962
I got him.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.273
Agatha!

28:16.528 --> 28:18.363
- Go! Just go!
- No! Come on!

28:18.655 --> 28:19.948
- Run!
- No!

28:20.573 --> 28:21.950
- Run!
- No!

28:23.159 --> 28:24.244
Agatha, no!

28:26.746 --> 28:28.415
No! Get off!

28:30.542 --> 28:33.044
No! No! No! No! No!

28:47.225 --> 28:48.768
Look! They're back!

28:48.852 --> 28:50.311
They've got the horses!

28:57.902 --> 28:59.654
Oh, my God!

29:04.868 --> 29:06.745
I'll go get Aaron.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.341
All right, I'm out.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.430
Bye.

29:33.354 --> 29:34.731
Very good boy.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.902
Hey, Carol.

29:39.527 --> 29:40.612
Can we talk?

29:41.029 --> 29:42.238
Yeah, sure.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.949
I know what you're doing,
and I want you to stop.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.993
Sorry?

29:47.702 --> 29:49.454
You're giving Kelly false hope.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.040
I... I don't understand.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.833
Yes, you do.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.627
You don't think Connie's alive.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.630
You just can't accept
what it means if she's not.

29:59.547 --> 30:00.673
Well, you're Connie's family.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.009
I would think you'd want to know
either way.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.053
I want my family to heal.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.763
All that's left of it.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.140
Kelly looks up to you.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.602
Carol, I'm sorry for whatever
you're going through,

30:13.061 --> 30:15.021
but I'm asking you, I'm begging you,

30:15.855 --> 30:19.442
whatever doing or telling her, stop.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.362
You're just making it harder.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.498
Come on, buddy.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.048
There you go.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.062
Go on.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.814
No, thank you.

32:23.566 --> 32:26.152
Just take really small bites.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.781
The smaller, the better.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.158
You've eaten it before?

32:32.742 --> 32:34.744
Yeah, on the road, with my mom.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.788
You eat what you find.

32:42.418 --> 32:43.878
You ever been on the road?

32:44.504 --> 32:45.755
Not like that.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.299
Well, you meet a lot of different people.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.887
Just chew it fast.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.264
It's not that bad.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.475
Not like the spiders.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.111
Wanna see if we can pet a pony?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.697
Hey. Look.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.949
They're interested.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.830
Do you want to pet a pony?

33:19.497 --> 33:21.165
Beautiful, right? Look. Look.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.227
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.329
Goddamn shit.

34:44.832 --> 34:45.833
What?

34:46.167 --> 34:48.336
You like the taste of crap cardboard?

34:52.799 --> 34:54.300
We should get back in the woods.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.053
The road is faster.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.889
He's right. The woods have cover.
It's safer.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.351
Let's go there.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.812
No. We need to keep moving.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.856
No, we need a break.

35:37.343 --> 35:40.054
We'll rest here for a while,
and then we'll head out.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.353
I know what you're thinking.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.438
The answer is no.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.238
He's right, Maggie.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.742
I'm slowing you down.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.995
Nope.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.329
We're fine.

36:05.621 --> 36:07.081
Maybe now.

36:08.749 --> 36:11.627
If these guys are anything
like you say they are,

36:11.919 --> 36:13.754
then it's gonna get worse.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.218
I'm dead weight.

36:20.803 --> 36:22.013
We all know it.

36:22.722 --> 36:23.806
We'll help you.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.737
You wanna know why
I walked away from him

36:38.696 --> 36:40.323
and everything he stood for...

36:41.741 --> 36:43.451
Joined up with you?

36:46.537 --> 36:48.206
It's 'cause I trust you

36:49.498 --> 36:51.000
to do the right thing.

36:52.418 --> 36:55.171
No matter how hard it is
or how much it costs you.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.926
The supplies... Maggie, look at me.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.389
The supplies are the only thing
that matters now.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.392
Alexandria needs us to do this.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.896
They're waiting for us.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.066
Hershel and Judith.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.193
Adam...

37:17.526 --> 37:19.362
And Adam needs a father.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.240
You think I'm gonna make it out
of that town alive like this?

37:23.783 --> 37:26.869
- You left Gage. Leave me.
- Gage made his choice.

37:28.537 --> 37:29.705
And I'm making mine.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.085
No.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.963
- Just...
- No.

37:37.171 --> 37:38.965
Maggie, if this plan fails,

37:40.216 --> 37:44.595
then everything you've worked for,
everything you want for the future,

37:46.138 --> 37:47.431
it dies with it.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.313
And then what happens to Adam?

37:55.648 --> 37:56.732
Okay.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.276
It's not that simple.

38:01.487 --> 38:02.905
Yeah, it is.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.119
The sun is going down.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.162
Maggie...

38:10.997 --> 38:12.581
You have to make a decision.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.335
It's easy for you, isn't it?

38:19.213 --> 38:23.050
Being reckless with somebody else's life.

38:29.390 --> 38:33.102
But you don't get to decide
who lives and who dies anymore.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.317
It's your fault.

38:40.234 --> 38:41.610
That we're here.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.073
It's your fault.

38:47.908 --> 38:50.369
Because you destroyed
everything that we built.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.377
You still have to decide.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.953
Mag... Maggie.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.377
Here.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.553
You better be here when we get back.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.180
You better come back.
