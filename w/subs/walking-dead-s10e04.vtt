left the house.

for a long time,

39:08.932 --> 39:11.393

for what happened last year.

39:13.187 --> 39:14.563
Kept thinking,

39:15.689 --> 39:18.692
what if I just stayed
in that cell at Hilltop?

let myself be taken alive

with Henry?

39:28.202 --> 39:30.495
Never said
what I said to my mother?

stood up for me
