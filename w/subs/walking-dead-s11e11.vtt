WEBVTT

00:17.669 --> 00:20.150
What in the name of little
billy goats are you doing?

00:20.194 --> 00:21.847
I woke up early and
I couldn't go back to sleep,

00:21.891 --> 00:24.807
so I started
reading your novel.

00:24.850 --> 00:28.550
Hold on.
I'm almost finished.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.901
Well, I-I on the other hand
am nowhere near finished.

00:37.254 --> 00:41.084
Um, you know,
several early scenes

00:41.128 --> 00:42.564
lack context
intentionally,

00:42.607 --> 00:45.349
which will be made clear
in the subsequent

00:45.393 --> 00:46.568
and as-of-now-unwritten
chapters --

00:46.611 --> 00:47.699
Shh!

00:52.052 --> 00:54.010
I'm merely just trying to
retroactively

00:54.054 --> 00:55.838
manage your expectations
is all.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.413
I love it.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.154
And I'm really
proud of you.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.591
Oh.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.419
Oh, I'm gonna be
late for work.

01:21.733 --> 01:25.694
You know, uh, I was thinking
about you yesterday

01:25.737 --> 01:27.522
while I was getting
my knives sharpened, and --

01:27.565 --> 01:29.959
Should I
be alarmed here?

01:30.002 --> 01:32.179
Uh, no.
The thought which sprang to mind

01:32.222 --> 01:36.139
was decidedly
not homicidal.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.446
At any rate,
this particular cutler

01:38.489 --> 01:40.317
also happens
to be a key cutter.

01:49.892 --> 01:53.896
I want to very much see
more of you.

01:53.939 --> 01:57.160
And with your job taking up
so much of your time as of late,

01:57.204 --> 02:00.207
I just figured this might
make things a little bit easier.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.993
In case it is not clear,
it is a key to my apartment.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.609
Stephanie,

02:11.653 --> 02:13.350
I love you.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.489
I love you, too.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.120
So, things went well?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.644
Well, to put it bluntly,

02:46.688 --> 02:48.690
I'm meeting her
for ice cream at 17:30,

02:48.733 --> 02:52.041
and I'm still uncertain
as to my follow-up move.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.870
But I can recognize that
what transpired

02:54.913 --> 02:57.133
was a positive outcome.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.961
I have so little
frame of reference,

02:59.004 --> 03:01.833
I cannot hold it conceivable
what comes next.

03:01.877 --> 03:02.965
Do you love her?

03:03.008 --> 03:04.880
A strong affirmative.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.708
And she has said
that she reciprocates.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.971
Then relax.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.320
I'm serious.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.801
When a woman tells you
that she loves you,

03:12.844 --> 03:14.237
believe her.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.065
Stephanie.
It's Eugene.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.157
Are you there?

04:51.769 --> 04:53.336
Stephanie!

04:58.863 --> 05:01.518
Stephanie!

05:01.562 --> 05:02.737
Stephanie, it's Eugene.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.347
Are you there?

05:16.403 --> 05:18.970
Stephanie!

05:19.014 --> 05:20.363
It's Eugene.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.027
Are you in there, Stephanie?

06:24.558 --> 06:26.168
Looks good.
Put it to bed.

06:32.696 --> 06:35.438
Hold on.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.744
She says
it doesn't look good.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.963
Yeah, I got that one.

06:42.445 --> 06:47.494
"Trooper Davis has a story
to tell.

06:47.537 --> 06:48.843
He wouldn't risk
getting kicked out

06:48.886 --> 06:51.323
of Commonwealth
for no reason."

06:51.367 --> 06:53.021
That's right.
He didn't.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.370
We have a statement
from his doctors

06:54.414 --> 06:56.720
backing up
his PTSD claim.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.505
"Come on.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.942
I don't trust the military
doctors any more

07:00.985 --> 07:04.206
than I trust
the military command.

07:04.249 --> 07:08.384
Something happened
to Tyler Davis.

07:08.428 --> 07:12.388
Something that he blames
Governor Milton for.

07:12.432 --> 07:17.393
Something worth confronting her
in public over.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.091
And they clearly have a reason
for suppressing the truth."

07:20.135 --> 07:21.963
That's one
interpretation.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.487
The other is that Tyler Davis
had a mental-health crisis.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.141
And only one of
those interpretations

07:26.184 --> 07:27.751
has the facts
to support it.

07:31.886 --> 07:35.498
"He spoke of thousands
more like him.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.893
What does that mean?

07:38.936 --> 07:40.503
We should be --"

07:57.651 --> 08:00.305
"We should be printing
what really happened

08:00.349 --> 08:02.525
at the masquerade ball.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.745
But, instead, you want
to paraphrase

08:04.788 --> 08:06.921
what Governor Milton said
in her press release."

08:06.964 --> 08:08.009
No, Connie.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.314
I want <i>you</i>
to paraphrase

08:09.358 --> 08:10.707
Governor Milton's
press release

08:10.751 --> 08:13.101
so that the next time,
I don't have to.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.109
Well, if no one's seen her
and no one's talked to her,

08:21.152 --> 08:22.806
how can she have
called in sick?

08:22.850 --> 08:24.329
I never said she did.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.505
All I know is,
I was told to be here

08:25.548 --> 08:28.246
because
she didn't show up.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.813
You mind?

09:04.369 --> 09:05.893
This is a private room.

09:09.287 --> 09:13.030
"Tyler Davis --
does he have a lawyer?

09:13.074 --> 09:14.989
What are the charges
against him?"

09:25.608 --> 09:27.088
This is C.A.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.829
We've been asked to perform
a wellness check.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.311
Please open the door.

09:46.194 --> 09:49.197
She's not there.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.634
Then I'd like to make
a statement immediately,

09:51.678 --> 09:53.854
recount the details of her
last-knowns on the record now

09:53.897 --> 09:55.856
while this is still
fresh in my mind.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.640
Sure.
Come down to the station.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.511
I'll help you fill out
the paperwork.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.905
How often do you
take trips like this?

10:44.948 --> 10:47.995
Not as often
as I'd like.

10:48.038 --> 10:51.694
This probably sounds crazy,
but I feel like

10:51.738 --> 10:53.261
I'm better out here
than I am in the city.

10:53.304 --> 10:57.395
It doesn't sound crazy
at all.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.920
A lot of my people
feel that way, too.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.923
You still see this
as your people and my people.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.359
I want you to see
how this place works,

11:04.402 --> 11:09.886
because I want you
to be a part of it.

11:09.930 --> 11:13.585
I've done fairly well,
all things considered,

11:13.629 --> 11:16.719
but let's just say
I didn't start out on the top.

11:16.763 --> 11:20.244
Is that where
you are now?

11:20.288 --> 11:21.724
Hardly.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.771
Governor Milton
runs the city.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.730
But I know how it runs.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.472
Because you started out
at the bottom.

11:30.515 --> 11:35.129
I proved myself to the Milton
family a long time ago.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.479
If you're in with
the right people, Carol,

11:37.522 --> 11:40.438
the sky's the limit.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.658
And one of the things you learn
as you're climbing your way up

11:42.702 --> 11:45.748
is that there are two types
of people in any organization.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.881
On the one hand,
you've got the mercenaries.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.318
They're in it for the money
and whatever psychological itch

11:50.361 --> 11:53.538
their position
allows them to scratch.

11:53.582 --> 11:57.760
And on the other,
you have the patriots,

11:57.804 --> 12:01.111
the true believers,
the ones who want to do good.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.852
And whether they are or not
might be up to debate,

12:02.896 --> 12:04.245
but in their hearts,
they're there

12:04.288 --> 12:07.944
because they believe
in the organization.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.511
Is that why I'm here?

12:09.554 --> 12:12.383
You want to make
a true believer out of me?

12:12.427 --> 12:13.689
I read your file.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.995
You're here
because you're smart.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.300
I think you'll be
able to help me

12:16.344 --> 12:18.999
deal with this asshole.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.827
What you get out of it
is up to you.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.953
What are we?

12:59.996 --> 13:01.563
Drug dealers
or smugglers?

13:04.044 --> 13:05.480
We're smugglers.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.657
But it's not
what you think.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.746
This place is not exactly
a part of the Commonwealth,

13:10.790 --> 13:13.923
but they need us,
and we need them.

13:13.967 --> 13:17.057
We use the poppies to make
opium for the hospital.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.408
Things will start looking pretty
bleak there if we run out.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.236
I make sure
that doesn't happen.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.586
But, sometimes, that means
dealing with guys like Moto.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.849
I told you
what was gonna happen.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.679
And I asked you
to manage it.

13:30.722 --> 13:33.421
I talked him into processing
this last batch.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.857
Best I could do.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.599
I told you they're gonna
hold the harvest hostage.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.992
They want a raise.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.950
They swear they'll let it
rot without one.

13:43.083 --> 13:47.522
Well,
let's see what we can do.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.403
Hey.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.015
We're with
the <i>Tribune.</i>

14:02.058 --> 14:04.582
You're in number 2.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.589
Yeah, he said wait
for recon to burn.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.462
Alright.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.072
let's march it down.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.817
over here.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.173
when we're ready.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.148
- Alright.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.021
- Let's roll.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.595
Hey.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.380
I haven't
seen you around.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.947
How are you holding up?

15:04.991 --> 15:07.907
I'm functioning within
to-be-expected parameters.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.038
Yeah, no,
I can see that.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.344
Uh,
so can you let me in?

15:10.387 --> 15:11.998
I brought lasagna.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.150
This is an empty dish.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.370
Oh, yeah, sorry.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.241
I didn't make lasagna.

15:38.285 --> 15:42.767
People just always have to let
you in if you're carrying food.

15:42.811 --> 15:46.249
So, what's up?

15:51.211 --> 15:52.995
When the C.A.
gave up the search,

15:53.039 --> 15:54.214
I decided to investigate

15:54.257 --> 15:56.216
Stephanie's disappearance
myself.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.354
Truth be told,
as the hours tick by

16:04.398 --> 16:07.009
with nary a bread crumb
to be found,

16:07.053 --> 16:09.011
I let my despair
get the best of me.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.495
That is, until a chance
encounter put me on the trail.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.206
Sir. Sir.

16:32.252 --> 16:35.603
Sir, I need to talk to you.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.953
Please,
I need to talk --

16:43.350 --> 16:46.788
1634 Racine.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.443
It's an apartment building
in Residential One.

16:49.486 --> 16:52.272
Three days ago,
you were seen --

16:52.315 --> 16:55.449
At 7:00 in the p.m., you were
seen coming down the stairs.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.059
- I don't remember this.
- Uh, wait.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.669
Uh, sir, sir.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.280
Sir, please.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.546
Someone near and dear
to me has gone missing,

17:05.589 --> 17:08.418
and you may have seen something
that might help me find her.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.510
Where was this?

17:13.554 --> 17:16.078
Residential One.

17:16.122 --> 17:20.778
Three days ago, at approximately
7:00 in the p.m.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.258
Yeah.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.259
At Residential One.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.000
I remember that now.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.655
I got called in to fix
a clogged sink.

17:27.698 --> 17:31.876
What -- Do -- Do you
remember seeing her there?

17:35.750 --> 17:39.145
Do you remember
seeing her there?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.842
Or anything suspicious

17:40.885 --> 17:44.933
in or around the premises
that night?

17:44.976 --> 17:46.500
No.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.328
We done?

17:48.371 --> 17:50.591
I sincerely apologize
for having troubled you.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.115
If there's a better time
in which we could talk --

17:55.900 --> 17:57.511
Needless to say,
I greeted his story

17:57.554 --> 18:00.079
with a great deal
of skepticism.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.124
There were no city service carts
on the street that night,

18:02.168 --> 18:04.605
nor was he wearing any sort
of identifying uniform

18:04.648 --> 18:05.997
or carrying any tools.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.564
I found it very peculiar

18:07.608 --> 18:09.262
that the one person
I knew was there

18:09.305 --> 18:10.872
the night she disappeared
happened to have

18:10.915 --> 18:12.352
such a flimsy alibi.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.748
So I started
following him.

18:23.580 --> 18:26.366
So, like, what's
this plumber's deal?

18:30.196 --> 18:33.547
To start with,
his name is Roman Calhoun.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.205
And he is most definitely
not a plumber.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.343
He mostly conducts
his business at night.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.564
His base of operations
is a building

18:50.607 --> 18:52.087
in the warehouse district,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.176
which purports to be a purveyor
of plumbing services

18:54.220 --> 18:56.831
and which, on the surface,
appears to be legitimate.

18:56.874 --> 19:00.617
However, they never
receive any mail.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.098
There's lights on at odd hours,
when they're ostensibly closed.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.317
And while people
go in and out

19:04.360 --> 19:05.840
with a fair degree
of regularity,

19:05.883 --> 19:08.886
it's usually just the same
four people over and over.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.411
They usually arrive alone
and depart shortly thereafter

19:11.454 --> 19:13.108
and frequently meeting
in groups of two.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.066
And on the one occasion
they were all together,

19:15.110 --> 19:18.244
they were also
met by a fifth,

19:18.287 --> 19:22.683
who I also believe
to be the head honcho,

19:22.726 --> 19:24.989
the mastermind of some sort
of rogue element

19:25.033 --> 19:27.949
within the government that
Stephanie somehow ran afoul of.

19:29.733 --> 19:30.995
Rogue element?

19:31.039 --> 19:33.172
Like, you think
she was kidnapped

19:33.215 --> 19:35.130
by the government
or something?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.784
Shortly after
I began my search,

19:36.827 --> 19:38.481
the man who later
became known to me

19:38.525 --> 19:41.658
as Co-Conspirator Number Two,
a.k.a. "Beanie Hat Man,"

19:41.702 --> 19:43.921
showed up
to Stephanie's apartment

19:43.965 --> 19:47.186
with a team of movers,
collected all her belongings,

19:47.229 --> 19:49.579
and took them
to an unknown location.

19:49.623 --> 19:54.280
Then, that same day,
this was found

19:54.323 --> 19:57.848
in Stephanie's file
at Union Station.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.155
It's a work-transfer request
signed by Stephanie

20:00.199 --> 20:02.897
on the day
of her disappearance.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.725
The man who filled in for her
at the radio room

20:04.768 --> 20:07.641
that day told me
she gave no notice whatsoever.

20:07.684 --> 20:10.426
Such orders could not be
falsified or fabricated

20:10.470 --> 20:13.951
without direct influence
from within the halls of power.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.302
She knew they were
coming for her.

20:16.345 --> 20:18.478
When she eluded them,
they filed that false

20:18.521 --> 20:21.742
work transfer to cover up
her disappearance.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.831
They took all her belongings
to recover

20:23.874 --> 20:25.354
any evidence
she may have gathered,

20:25.398 --> 20:28.488
and now silencing her
is the last step

20:28.531 --> 20:30.141
in repairing that leak.

20:34.537 --> 20:38.019
If I'm right,

20:38.062 --> 20:40.587
her only hope
is for me to expose them

20:40.630 --> 20:42.197
before they find her.

20:47.550 --> 20:48.725
Good hatches this year?

20:48.769 --> 20:50.292
Yes, sir.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.686
We catch enough that I can
actually just do it for fun.

20:52.729 --> 20:55.732
It's nice when your hobby
is also an apocalypse skill.

20:55.776 --> 20:59.214
Amen to that.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.172
So, I can't give them
what they want,

21:01.216 --> 21:02.826
but maybe
we can meet halfway.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.873
They get a raise,
but they earn it.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.222
Incentives.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.311
Produce more,

21:09.355 --> 21:10.704
make more.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.490
Best I can do.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.339
See what
you need to see?

23:08.561 --> 23:10.954
"More than enough."

23:10.998 --> 23:12.303
Then this is the part
where you ask me

23:12.347 --> 23:14.305
the questions
they sent you.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.278
"It's been a month since
former trooper Tyler Davis

23:30.321 --> 23:33.586
has been in the hospital
under armed guard.

23:33.629 --> 23:37.285
What is he
being charged with?"

23:37.328 --> 23:39.113
That's not one
of the questions.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.377
"Does it have anything to do
with the fact

23:42.421 --> 23:46.860
that the woman he took hostage
was your sister?"

23:46.903 --> 23:49.515
I was wondering when you were
gonna figure that out.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.303
For the record,
the answer is,

23:55.346 --> 23:57.914
my sister don't have
a goddamn thing to do with it.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.007
"He was loyal,

24:04.051 --> 24:07.054
recommended for
early promotion --

24:07.097 --> 24:09.143
by you.

24:09.186 --> 24:11.972
And he wound up feeling like
the military

24:12.015 --> 24:14.714
was being manipulated
by the politicians."

24:16.977 --> 24:20.937
"If I was you, I would be
really interested

24:20.981 --> 24:24.550
in who I was risking
my life for."

24:24.593 --> 24:28.118
And if I were you,
I might wonder why I'm out here

24:28.162 --> 24:29.816
digging for answers
that we both know

24:29.859 --> 24:31.687
will never see
the light of day.

24:49.705 --> 24:52.969
Hey, Eugene,

24:53.013 --> 24:58.279
it's really cool,
you know?

24:58.322 --> 24:59.846
You doing
so much for her.

24:59.889 --> 25:03.502
Strike that.
Reverse that.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.374
I'm merely trying to repay
what I owe.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.816
Mm.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.775
I made a promise to myself
in those early days,

25:15.818 --> 25:17.994
back when we thought this would
all blow over in a few weeks,

25:18.038 --> 25:20.301
that if I lived
through this,

25:20.344 --> 25:23.391
I'd pursue my dream of becoming
a science-fiction author.

25:27.874 --> 25:30.050
I have jokingly related
that story to Stephanie

25:30.093 --> 25:32.792
over the radio.

25:32.835 --> 25:36.491
And she told me,

25:36.535 --> 25:38.449
"You can't wait till after
you've lived through it,

25:38.493 --> 25:42.932
'cause ready or not,
right now is all we've got."

25:48.068 --> 25:49.504
She gave me the courage
to do something

25:49.548 --> 25:50.897
I've always wanted to do,

25:50.940 --> 25:52.942
and when someone can do that
for you, well...

25:54.988 --> 25:58.208
...words like love
seem insufficient.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.563
Mm.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.748
Shit.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.492
Let's go.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.538
You want to break
into his apartment?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.061
Yeah.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.585
I don't want to get in trouble,
Eugene.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.804
I got a little job.
I got a little bed.

26:28.848 --> 26:31.894
I might get a little cat.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.504
This is so bad.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.158
His Tuesday 10-mile
is ironclad.

26:35.202 --> 26:38.988
He'll be gone
for 90 minutes.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.337
Please.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.862
Princess, he's the key

26:42.905 --> 26:44.211
to cracking this
whole thing wide open.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.647
I just know it.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.268
Sorry we can't stay
for the fish fry.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.400
Next time, my friend.

26:59.443 --> 27:00.706
Yeah, deal.

27:09.236 --> 27:12.195
Well,
what do you think?

27:16.417 --> 27:18.680
He's robbing them.

27:18.724 --> 27:21.727
I talked to one
of the lieutenants.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.946
He's pocketing the money
that you give them for raises

27:23.990 --> 27:25.600
and beating them
to keep quiet about it.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.211
He went too far
the other night,

27:28.255 --> 27:29.865
and that's why
they're on strike.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.743
They'll get their money back

27:37.786 --> 27:41.355
and the raise
I just promised them.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.749
What about Moto?

27:43.792 --> 27:47.317
Well, I'm not gonna go fishing
with him anymore,

27:47.361 --> 27:48.928
that's for sure.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.759
Take him into custody now.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.985
Hey!
What -- What the hell?

28:03.029 --> 28:04.987
Get your hands
off of me.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.946
Hornsby!

28:06.989 --> 28:08.556
You mother-pussbucket!

28:48.683 --> 28:50.380
Hey, Eugene?

28:50.424 --> 28:52.687
What's this guy do when it rains
on his 10-mile run?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.384
Well, given our recent
lack of precipitation,

28:54.428 --> 28:57.039
I've not yet
gathered that data.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.520
Well, you have now.
He's here.

28:59.563 --> 29:02.262
We have to
get out of here.

29:02.305 --> 29:03.959
Count off his range.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.004
What?

29:05.047 --> 29:08.181
His range --
50, 40, 30.

29:08.224 --> 29:09.530
I'm not good at that.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.706
Just tell me
how much time I have.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.752
Dude, I am telling you
how much time you have,

29:13.795 --> 29:15.275
and you have no time.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.688
I saw them
on the ladder outside.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.212
Couldn't have
gotten that far.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.562
Hey! There they are!
That's them!

30:05.629 --> 30:06.979
General Mercer,
how can I help you?

30:07.022 --> 30:09.068
Where is the patient
who was in M-33

30:09.111 --> 30:11.418
and the soldiers
that were with him?

30:11.461 --> 30:14.377
There's no one
in M-33.

30:14.421 --> 30:17.293
I realize that.

30:17.337 --> 30:21.080
I want to know what happened
to the man who was in there.

30:21.123 --> 30:24.431
He can't be moved
without my authorization.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.433
I'm sorry, but, apparently,
he can.

30:35.485 --> 30:38.662
I'm truly sorry that
I manipulated you

30:38.706 --> 30:41.056
into accompanying me on
this lame-brained misadventure.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.145
I fully intend to make known
that you had no role

30:43.189 --> 30:46.801
in planning my scheme and no
witting part in its execution.

30:54.156 --> 30:55.331
Hey.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.029
I just got back in town.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.773
What the hell,
you two?

31:02.817 --> 31:07.474
Well, Roman Calhoun is
exactly who he says he is.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.171
He's a plumber at Ruby's.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.219
They've been a little lazy
with the paperwork,

31:13.262 --> 31:15.612
but they do have
a contract with the city.

31:15.656 --> 31:19.399
And, according to this invoice,
Mr. Calhoun was sent

31:19.442 --> 31:21.096
to Stephanie's building
on the night

31:21.140 --> 31:26.667
you saw him there
to fix a sink in a work area.

31:26.710 --> 31:30.236
But what about the kidnap kit
we found in his closet?

31:30.279 --> 31:32.020
Those weapons
are illegal.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.369
For you.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.371
He's a full citizen.
He has a license.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.851
A lot of us have go bags,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.984
even people who have been here
for years.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.209
I told Calhoun your story,

31:47.253 --> 31:48.950
told him about Stephanie,

31:48.994 --> 31:50.865
explained everything
you've been through,

31:50.909 --> 31:53.302
the mental anguish
that it's caused you,

31:53.346 --> 31:57.350
and he has agreed
to not press charges.

31:57.393 --> 32:00.788
But you have to
leave him alone.

32:00.831 --> 32:04.009
Oh, and sign that.

32:04.052 --> 32:07.229
It states you were
emotionally distraught

32:07.273 --> 32:08.839
and in a paranoid state

32:08.883 --> 32:11.364
following the disappearance
of your girlfriend.

32:11.407 --> 32:14.367
I'm sorry this didn't lead
where you thought it would.

32:14.410 --> 32:17.022
You were wrong about Calhoun,
and you need to accept that,

32:17.065 --> 32:20.939
because if you don't,
I'm not gonna be able to help.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.236
Eugene:
I should have known.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.368
The conspiracy goes deeper
than I initially thought.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.891
Dude,
none of this is happening!

33:00.935 --> 33:02.676
Stephanie
broke up with you.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.159
That's utterly absurd.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.725
Look, I've been thinking it,
but, you know,

33:08.769 --> 33:10.945
what if you were right
about this Calhoun guy?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.904
But the dude is a plumber,
Euge.

33:13.948 --> 33:16.298
You've got --
<i>Mira.</i>

33:16.342 --> 33:18.953
You've got
Stephanie's work-transfer order.

33:18.997 --> 33:23.784
Moving guys literally came
and took her furniture.

33:23.827 --> 33:27.657
Maybe it's not
that complicated.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.572
But the first bit of advice
you gave me was,

33:29.616 --> 33:32.140
"When a woman tells you
she loves you, believe her."

33:32.184 --> 33:35.709
Yeah, well, when a woman
quits her job

33:35.752 --> 33:37.972
and moves away
without telling you,

33:38.016 --> 33:40.192
maybe you should
believe that, too.

33:53.553 --> 33:58.253
The day my dad
had enough,

33:58.297 --> 34:00.777
my man just split.

34:00.821 --> 34:04.564
And I thought
that it was because

34:04.607 --> 34:08.002
I smoked his cigarettes.

34:08.046 --> 34:11.397
And I never
saw him again.

34:11.440 --> 34:15.314
So, who knows?

34:15.357 --> 34:17.142
Maybe that was it.

34:18.926 --> 34:23.017
I mean, you can think
you know someone

34:23.061 --> 34:28.153
and then find out
you never even met them.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.418
Yeah, it sucks, man.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.205
But it happens
all the time.

34:41.427 --> 34:45.518
I can appreciate how you might
reach that conclusion.

34:45.561 --> 34:50.784
However, I'm privy to one piece
of data that you are not.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.574
I know how it felt.

35:03.753 --> 35:05.581
Okay.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.889
Well,
it was just a theory.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.851
Hey!

38:09.896 --> 38:12.072
Aah!

38:14.509 --> 38:16.337
I told you
I heard something.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.707
I'll handle it.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.378
You played me.

39:01.687 --> 39:04.385
I knew.

39:04.429 --> 39:07.910
You corroborated
Calhoun's bogus alibi,

39:07.954 --> 39:09.999
I was certain you were involved
with covering up

39:10.043 --> 39:11.784
Stephanie's disappearance.

39:14.177 --> 39:19.052
But now I realize the depths
of my self-delusion,

39:19.095 --> 39:22.272
because Occam's razor should
have led me to this conclusion

39:22.316 --> 39:25.188
before a well-placed kick
to the belly ever did.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.721
There was never
any Stephanie.

39:37.853 --> 39:40.247
Who is she?

39:40.290 --> 39:42.249
Is she an undercover agent?

39:44.469 --> 39:45.992
A con artist
that owes you a favor?

39:46.035 --> 39:47.907
Well,
she was very convincing.

39:50.605 --> 39:54.043
You used her to pull
at my heartstrings

39:54.087 --> 39:55.654
and to trick me
into telling you

39:55.697 --> 39:58.047
everything you wanted to know
about our communities.

39:58.091 --> 39:59.745
Well, it worked.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.358
She led me
to the train yard,

40:04.402 --> 40:06.404
where we were
captured by you!

40:09.537 --> 40:12.018
You thought I wa--
you thought I was an easy mark,

40:12.061 --> 40:14.020
the most trusting of the police,
so you --

40:14.063 --> 40:15.848
you split off my friends
one at a time,

40:15.891 --> 40:19.068
thinking I'd break,
but I didn't break.

40:19.112 --> 40:20.896
Then she led me to the --
the radio room,

40:20.940 --> 40:23.290
where we were
captured again.

40:23.333 --> 40:26.162
Oh, and you certainly got
your money's worth there.

40:26.206 --> 40:29.949
I actually fell
for that one twice!

40:29.992 --> 40:32.255
She's the one that told me
I can trust you!

40:34.997 --> 40:38.566
And I did.

40:38.610 --> 40:42.222
She even read my book
so that she could get

40:42.265 --> 40:45.225
any helpful
autobiographical information

40:45.268 --> 40:47.314
that might
serve your needs!

40:50.709 --> 40:54.277
But now that you've gotten
everything you wanted, what?!

40:54.321 --> 40:56.889
No need to
continue the ruse?!

40:56.932 --> 40:58.151
Is that it?!

41:01.633 --> 41:05.637
But you didn't see
this twist.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.421
I am gonna make
absolutely certain

41:07.465 --> 41:12.165
that everybody knows exactly
who and what you are.

41:17.997 --> 41:21.348
Okay.

41:21.391 --> 41:24.612
And who or what is that,
exactly?

41:24.656 --> 41:27.397
The villain?

41:27.441 --> 41:30.531
The boogeyman?

41:30.575 --> 41:33.316
Or the best goddamn thing
that ever happened to you?

41:36.145 --> 41:38.496
You're right, Eugene.

41:38.539 --> 41:41.150
I did lie to you.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.761
Just like you
and your friends

41:42.804 --> 41:44.893
lied through your teeth
to get inside these walls.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.504
No. No.

41:46.547 --> 41:48.897
But who's keeping score,
right?

41:48.941 --> 41:51.334
So, I did what I had to do
to get you here.

41:51.378 --> 41:54.337
And you know what? You should be
thanking me for it.

41:54.381 --> 41:56.470
It's not my fault you people
are too stupid to know

41:56.514 --> 42:00.126
a good thing
when it landed in your laps.

42:00.169 --> 42:02.781
You're just --
you're just admitting it?

42:06.654 --> 42:10.484
I fell in love, and everything
I know about her is a fiction!

42:10.528 --> 42:11.920
Look, we tried to
rip the Band-Aid off

42:11.964 --> 42:13.748
when we saw
it was getting serious,

42:13.792 --> 42:15.968
and I did everything I could to
get you to stop looking for her,

42:16.011 --> 42:18.274
but you wouldn't.

42:18.318 --> 42:19.841
And here we are.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.324
At least you can stop now,
right?

42:27.240 --> 42:31.026
It wasn't gonna get better
for your people, Eugene.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.680
They were about to starve.

42:34.856 --> 42:36.205
And now you're here

42:36.249 --> 42:38.120
and your community
is getting fixed

42:38.164 --> 42:39.382
and you've got everything,

42:39.426 --> 42:42.560
from concerts
to cancer surgery.

42:42.603 --> 42:45.432
And literally the only thing
we've ever asked of you all

42:45.475 --> 42:49.392
in return is to be productive
members of society here

42:49.436 --> 42:51.917
for as long
as you choose to stay.

42:54.223 --> 42:56.791
So, tell them
whatever you want.

42:56.835 --> 43:00.142
The statement you signed
to get out of jail

43:00.186 --> 43:02.449
says you were suffering
from paranoia

43:02.492 --> 43:05.017
as a result of
nervous strain.

43:08.237 --> 43:10.892
Remember?

43:10.936 --> 43:15.549
I mean,
look at you, Eugene.

43:15.593 --> 43:20.293
This has obviously
taken a toll.

43:20.336 --> 43:23.209
Am I sorry your heart
got broken?

43:23.252 --> 43:25.603
Absolutely.

43:25.646 --> 43:27.256
And I'm sure your friends
will be very sad

43:27.300 --> 43:29.041
to hear about it, too.

43:29.084 --> 43:32.827
But in the balance
of things,

43:32.871 --> 43:36.222
I still think it worked out
in everyone's favor.

43:36.265 --> 43:37.876
And they probably would,
too.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.714
Oh.

43:49.757 --> 43:52.760
By the way,

43:52.804 --> 43:56.198
Stephanie's real name
is Shira.

43:56.242 --> 43:58.505
And she hates
Iron Maiden.

43:58.548 --> 44:01.116
But she genuinely enjoyed
your book.

44:03.815 --> 44:05.599
You should stick with it.

45:07.966 --> 45:10.708
Eugene?

45:10.751 --> 45:12.318
Are you alright?

45:14.363 --> 45:16.278
Eugene,
I need to talk to you.

45:21.457 --> 45:23.155
Tater Bug.

45:23.198 --> 45:24.896
This is Blue Weevil
to Tater Bug.

45:24.939 --> 45:27.463
Please come back.

45:39.911 --> 45:41.477
Who are you?

45:44.002 --> 45:45.525
It's me.

45:49.442 --> 45:51.879
I'm the one you were talking to
on the radio.
