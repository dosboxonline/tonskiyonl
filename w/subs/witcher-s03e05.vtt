[Geralt] Alone at last.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.000
What a night.

00:52.666 --> 00:55.208
I heard they put an aphrodisiac
in the wine.

00:56.416 --> 00:57.541
Are you surprised?

01:09.291 --> 01:11.541
Did you see what Sabrina was wearing,
by the way?

01:12.125 --> 01:13.000
[chuckles]

01:13.083 --> 01:15.291
-She's older than me by about--
-Yen.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.375
[Yennefer laughs]

01:17.458 --> 01:19.791
Hmm. I'm just glad it's over.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.708
[Yennefer] Are you sure about this?

01:48.500 --> 01:51.583
I don't know which I'd like to do more,
tear this costume off

01:51.666 --> 01:54.083
or run Stregobor through
with the nearest ice sculpture.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.125
Look how she hangs on him.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.250
Aah, the White Wolf.

02:00.333 --> 02:03.416
-[woman] Gelda! Come here.
-[man laughs] How wonderful!

[flames roaring]

02:20.916 --> 02:22.333
Thanks for coming.

02:22.416 --> 02:23.458
[woman] Mmm!

02:24.416 --> 02:25.458
[man] That's right!

02:26.208 --> 02:28.666
-Is there always this much staring?
-No.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.625
-[man] Come over here!
-It's all for us.

02:31.125 --> 02:34.208
Get used to it.
They'll be watching us all night.

02:34.291 --> 02:35.375
Oh. Good.

02:35.875 --> 02:38.500
Now, you should know the territory
before we step in.

02:39.291 --> 02:43.416
Over there, we have Sabrina Glevissig
and Marti Sodergren.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.291
-They're… passionate.
-…have some fun…

02:48.041 --> 02:53.166
By the fountain, we have Margarita
Laux-Antille, current headmistress.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.458
And Keira Metz. Quite the spitfire.

02:56.541 --> 02:59.541
We have Carduin, Bianca, Marquard,

02:59.625 --> 03:01.458
Detmold and his brother Drithelm,

03:01.541 --> 03:03.458
Radcliffe the Obnoxious.

03:03.958 --> 03:07.291
Artaud Terranova,
good mage, even better drunk.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.583
Vilgefortz, who's grown on me
despite my best efforts.

03:10.666 --> 03:12.791
Tissaia de Vries,
whom you already know.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.333
And Gerhart of Aelle.

03:14.416 --> 03:15.291
-I was saying…
-What?

03:15.375 --> 03:17.208
-The oldest living sorcerer.
-[sighs]

03:17.708 --> 03:20.125
Are you expecting me
to remember all those names?

03:20.625 --> 03:22.208
I thought you went to Oxenfurt?

03:22.291 --> 03:23.500
Hmm.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.291
Don't even think about it.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.000
[Geralt sighs]

03:37.000 --> 03:38.375
I gave you my word.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.458
She's safe in Loxia until dawn.

03:42.333 --> 03:45.250
When the ball ends
and the true conclave begins…

03:45.333 --> 03:47.708
-[Geralt sighs]
-…then we'll make our move.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.291
Tonight it's all about loosening spirits.

03:51.375 --> 03:54.500
And inspiring conviviality
in one perfect evening.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.791
-So behave yourself.
-I always behave myself.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.916
You have no memory of my party in Rinde?

04:00.416 --> 04:03.583
To say nothing of enchanted hedgehogs
and the Law of Surprise?

04:04.666 --> 04:05.916
That was complicated.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.375
Well, this is simple.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.250
We need this ball
to go off without a hitch,

04:10.333 --> 04:12.708
so please… dearest,

04:12.791 --> 04:14.916
stop eating like an underfed ghoul.

04:16.416 --> 04:20.416
When someone asks to speak to you,
you must accept, and quickly.

04:22.208 --> 04:26.458
And no matter how ludicrously
anyone is dressed, don't stare.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.416
Yennefer.

04:32.583 --> 04:33.916
And her witcher.

04:35.083 --> 04:37.125
We haven't yet had the pleasure.

04:39.708 --> 04:44.291
Geralt, this is Sabrina Glevissig
of Ard Carraigh, a school friend of mine.

04:44.375 --> 04:47.958
We've welcomed our share of spies,
thieves, and murderers at Aretuza,

04:48.750 --> 04:51.250
but not yet hosted a witcher.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.416
-Huh.
-Yen's been hiding you for far too long.

04:58.791 --> 04:59.875
[Geralt sighs]

-[sighing]

05:08.583 --> 05:10.583

05:13.333 --> 05:14.708
[sounds return to normal]

05:14.791 --> 05:18.875
I think Yen looks particularly lovely
this evening. Don't you?

05:22.666 --> 05:25.375
And he's not even lying. How dull.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.833
-Sabrina, that's no way to treat a guest.
-Hmm.

05:27.916 --> 05:29.875
He has so little experience in telepathy.

05:29.958 --> 05:33.833
Why did you bring your pet along,
if not for us to, uh…

05:35.166 --> 05:36.291
play with him?

05:36.791 --> 05:38.833
Dearest, why don't you go and get a drink?

05:38.916 --> 05:40.166
That's a great idea.

05:42.291 --> 05:44.500
What on earth
do you think you're playing at?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.083
-Yen, do you know what's better than sex?
-What?

05:48.166 --> 05:50.708
Getting a rise
out of the Savior of Sodden.

I wouldn't make a mess of this evening.

15:08.583 --> 15:09.833
[man] Make a mess of him!

15:09.916 --> 15:11.583
-[Geralt] So I won't.
-[woman groans]

15:13.166 --> 15:14.041
Truce?

15:14.625 --> 15:15.541
Oh shit!

15:16.208 --> 15:19.500
-[laughter]
-[woman] Who gave him champagne?

15:19.583 --> 15:21.416
-[man] Look at you!
-[Artaud yelps]

15:23.083 --> 15:25.166
[Sabrina] Artaud's wasted again!

15:29.750 --> 15:30.708
[Yennefer chuckles]

15:30.791 --> 15:33.416
A fight was quite the creative choice.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.666
-Just admit that you loved it.
-[laughs]

15:36.333 --> 15:40.041
As duels in my honor go, this one
certainly broke into the top three.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.541
Oh, well, it was an honor

15:41.625 --> 15:44.666
to fight for the capricious heart
of Yennefer of Vengerberg.

15:45.875 --> 15:49.000
And I hope to fight
many more battles with you, my dear.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.416
With me, or against me?

15:53.416 --> 15:54.583
Depends on the evening.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.083
[Geralt sighs]

15:58.041 --> 15:59.750
I shouldn't like to lose you, Yen.

16:02.541 --> 16:03.875
But you have me.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.375
Tonight will end.

16:12.041 --> 16:13.208
Everything ends.

16:13.291 --> 16:16.833
[Tissaia] And now, to bring
this wonderful evening to a close,

16:16.916 --> 16:18.583
a toast!

16:22.166 --> 16:25.500
To peace amongst mages of the North!

16:26.333 --> 16:29.000
[all] To peace!

16:31.375 --> 16:33.791
There is much work to be done tomorrow.

16:33.875 --> 16:37.791
But Tissaia and I are optimistic
about the future of this Continent,

16:37.875 --> 16:40.041
based on what we've seen here tonight.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.000
To peace!

16:42.083 --> 16:43.666
[all] To peace!

16:46.708 --> 16:50.708
And we have Yennefer of Vengerberg
to thank.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.125
[cheering and applause]

16:53.208 --> 16:54.416
[man] Yennefer!

16:54.916 --> 16:56.250
[Gerhart] Whoo! Brilliant.

17:00.833 --> 17:01.833
To us.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.416
And a nearly perfect evening.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.000
-…everyone.
-That was good.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.125
So.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.125
Now what?

17:11.208 --> 17:12.291
Hmm.

17:12.791 --> 17:16.375
-What a night indeed.
-[chuckles]

17:17.125 --> 17:19.000
I can't believe they bought it.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.833
I thought our performance
was quite convincing.

17:21.916 --> 17:26.041
And a good thing, too. Philippa was
watching the whole ballroom like a hawk.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.125
She comes by it naturally.

17:28.208 --> 17:32.625
We weren't the only ones plotting tonight.
I could tell from the moment we entered.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.208
[Geralt] Hmm.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.833
Lilac and gooseberries.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.500
Now, that I can tolerate.

17:41.666 --> 17:42.958
Are you sure about this?

17:44.458 --> 17:45.500
Are you?

17:51.916 --> 17:53.583
…finding spell.

17:53.666 --> 17:55.083
-Just a courtesy.
-Hmm…

17:56.083 --> 17:57.833
Oh yes, here they are.

18:01.208 --> 18:04.166
I don't know which I'd like more,
to tear this costume off

18:04.250 --> 18:07.000
or run Stregobor through
with the nearest ice sculpture.

18:07.083 --> 18:10.041
I know, and I hate the fucker
just as much as you do.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.958
But here,
we need to do things differently.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.916
The nearest serving fork, then.

18:14.625 --> 18:18.541
Or… rather than murder
an esteemed member of the Brotherhood

18:18.625 --> 18:20.125
in front of the entire North,

18:21.416 --> 18:22.333
we wait.

18:22.958 --> 18:24.833
-We seek out proof tonight.
-[sighs]

18:24.916 --> 18:27.541
We expose Stregobor
at the conclave tomorrow.

18:28.750 --> 18:29.958
He'll be put on trial.

18:30.541 --> 18:33.041
Until then, we have to play nicely

18:33.125 --> 18:35.833
if you-know-who's going to have
any kind of a future here.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.458
I saw what he did to those girls, Yen.

18:39.208 --> 18:41.666
I won't be leaving
until I know she's safe here.

18:42.541 --> 18:44.333
I hear you. But, Geralt…

18:45.791 --> 18:46.750

19:10.333 --> 19:12.041
Is there always this much staring?

19:12.750 --> 19:15.125
No. It's all for us.

19:15.791 --> 19:17.916
Get used to it.

to have another non-magical brother here.

[Dijkstra] This conclave may
bring the mages together,

22:15.541 --> 22:17.333
but it can't change the inevitable.

22:17.416 --> 22:18.625
War is brewing.

22:18.708 --> 22:21.666
Not just across the Continent,
but here in Aretuza.

22:22.916 --> 22:26.333
There are traitors who will soon
turn their loyalty to Nilfgaard

22:26.416 --> 22:27.750
and not the North.

22:27.833 --> 22:30.958
One would be wise
to abandon neutrality and choose a side

22:31.041 --> 22:33.166
or risk losing everything.

22:33.250 --> 22:36.833
Redania is your only hope
of keeping the Lion Cub safe.

give us the girl before it's too late.

who plunged my dagger into poor Renfri.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.250
-What's going on?
-There's an artifact.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.083
The Book of Monoliths, ancient Elven text.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.083
Never heard of it.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.333
Not surprising.
They didn't teach it at Aretuza.

24:10.416 --> 24:13.750
But it gives the holder the ability
to travel through time and space.

-How is that possible?
-I don't know. It should be impossible.

and… Stregobor has it.

24:21.458 --> 24:23.125
And we know where he's hiding it.

24:23.625 --> 24:26.500
I told Istredd
about you being attacked in the illusion.

24:27.291 --> 24:30.583
This is our chance, Yen.
We can get him for everything he's done.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.458

-Go on.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.416
[Stregobor] I'll take that, half-breed!

28:59.833 --> 29:01.666
[Stregobor] You don't belong here!

29:01.750 --> 29:03.458
-Hate to interrupt.
-[gasps]

29:04.458 --> 29:06.208
Stregobor, you piece of shit.

29:06.791 --> 29:09.458
You never gave a damn
about unity, did you?

29:09.541 --> 29:13.125
Mere smoke and mirrors
to hide what you'd returned to do.

29:13.208 --> 29:14.833
Raze Aretuza to the ground.

29:16.125 --> 29:18.166
Your kind never changes.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.791
And yet, our feckless leaders
forgive and forgive.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.375
Well, mercy isn't my cup of tea.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.708
[Geralt] Nor mine.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.625
You've been hard at work, haven't you?

29:27.708 --> 29:30.750
Corrupting portals, kidnapping novices.

29:30.833 --> 29:32.875
Torturing those young women
to get to Ciri.

29:32.958 --> 29:35.208
This doesn't concern you, witcher.

29:35.291 --> 29:38.208
And I don't care two rat tails
about that Cintran brat.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.958
With any luck,
she lies dead in a ditch by now.

29:41.041 --> 29:43.875
That Cintran brat has more power
than you could dream of.

29:44.500 --> 29:48.666
Or you could dream of. You have no idea
what you're dealing with here.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.833
The only threat you pose
is in your dirty blood.

29:51.916 --> 29:55.291
You're a monster who will soon
meet her reckoning. But the girl…

29:56.833 --> 30:00.791
The girl will most likely leave this world

30:00.875 --> 30:03.333
by your own mutant hands, Butcher.

30:03.416 --> 30:05.916
-I'll kill you myself.
-[Tissaia] Stop!

30:07.958 --> 30:10.666
[Triss] We came as soon as
we realized you were both gone.

30:12.041 --> 30:16.500
-Now would be the time to explain.
-Yes. Please, do.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.250
Stregobor has been keeping
a list of elven students

30:21.333 --> 30:22.833
and their belongings.

30:22.916 --> 30:25.916
The ones who went missing
this month. Nissa.

30:27.208 --> 30:28.583
-Elisabet.
-Teryn.

30:29.166 --> 30:31.583
He's been conducting experiments.

30:31.666 --> 30:33.166
Practicing mind control.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.333
What? That's absurd!

30:35.416 --> 30:37.875
He tried to kill me
using a botched portal.

30:37.958 --> 30:39.083
[splutters]

30:40.833 --> 30:43.083
Are you really gonna believe
a word she says?

30:43.166 --> 30:46.583
And we believe his ultimate aim
is set on Cirilla of Cintra.

30:48.291 --> 30:50.958
-You have proof of this?
-[Triss] We do.

30:55.583 --> 30:57.500
[Stregobor] What are you expecting
to find there?

31:12.208 --> 31:14.666
[Istredd] The Book of Monoliths.
An ancient elven tome.

31:14.750 --> 31:15.583
But--

31:15.666 --> 31:17.916
Rumored to contain knowledge
since before the Conjunction.

31:18.000 --> 31:18.875
[Stregobor] But--

31:18.958 --> 31:21.791
This holds the key to how
the human sphere collided with the elves'.

31:21.875 --> 31:24.833
More importantly,
how humans could get rid of elves again.

31:25.458 --> 31:27.250
And you stole it. Didn't you?

31:27.833 --> 31:30.916
Do I want to rid these halls
of you and your ilk? Yes.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.375
-But speculating that I--
-But nothing.

31:34.250 --> 31:36.416
These are serious allegations.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.708
I propose Stregobor is held
until the conclave concludes

31:40.791 --> 31:42.750
and we can have a full trial.

31:42.833 --> 31:45.833
-I concur.
-[scoffs] Yes, of course you do.

31:45.916 --> 31:47.000
Artorius?

31:51.666 --> 31:55.250
You've turned against our own
in a time of unity, Stregobor.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.500
I cannot stand by you today.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.041
Get off me! You're deranged!

32:01.666 --> 32:02.666
All of you!

32:03.166 --> 32:05.125
A pack of lies!

32:05.208 --> 32:07.083
I'll hide this for safekeeping.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.708
Make sure it doesn't
fall into the wrong hands again.

32:17.708 --> 32:19.333
You've saved the night.

32:21.041 --> 32:22.041
And you too.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.041
Let's go and enjoy our party.

32:34.708 --> 32:36.166
She'll be missing this.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.208
I need a drink.

32:42.791 --> 32:44.125
Or twelve. [sighs]

32:46.375 --> 32:47.250
A toast!

32:48.291 --> 32:51.541
To peace amongst mages of the North!

32:51.625 --> 32:54.291
[all] To peace!

32:54.375 --> 32:55.250

32:55.333 --> 32:57.666
There is much work to be done tomorrow,

32:58.250 --> 33:01.541
but Tissaia and I are optimistic
about the future of the Continent,

33:01.625 --> 33:03.916
based on what we've seen here tonight.

33:04.833 --> 33:05.791
To peace!

33:05.875 --> 33:08.041
[all] To peace!

33:29.166 --> 33:31.458
And a nearly perfect evening.

33:35.083 --> 33:36.166
I love you.

33:41.250 --> 33:43.250
That's the first time
you've ever said that.

33:45.541 --> 33:46.500
It can't be.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.500
You used to think it.

33:49.791 --> 33:51.500
But tonight, you actually said it.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.666
You can kiss me now.

night out together.

And all I can think about
is getting you alone.

Hmm… It's hard to say.

-Can't get Philippa out my head.
-How do you mean?

34:51.416 --> 34:53.416
When I visited her in Redania,

34:53.916 --> 34:55.750
she said I was one of them.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.666
But tonight,
it's like she wanted me on her side.

-Her side of what?
-She didn't say.

What happened between Tissaia and I.

[applause]

36:22.041 --> 36:24.875

36:26.041 --> 36:28.000
Not to ally with Vilgefortz.

36:28.583 --> 36:32.166
To let the Continent fight their own
impossible battle. But she refused.

36:32.250 --> 36:34.291
-And we won.
-But at what cost?

36:40.416 --> 36:43.416
Too many mages were lost
by the time you began.

36:44.416 --> 36:46.125
And you lost too, didn't you?

36:46.208 --> 36:49.833
Tissaia wasn't just following Vilgefortz.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.791
She was fighting for the Brotherhood.

36:52.291 --> 36:54.333
The North, same as we're doing now.

36:54.416 --> 36:56.541
You're fighting on a sinking ship.

36:57.916 --> 37:01.208
The Brotherhood has no place
in the future of the Continent.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.666
Tissaia has good intentions,

37:03.750 --> 37:07.666
but her loyalty to this supposed home
will be her downfall.

37:08.458 --> 37:09.291
And mine too.

37:10.416 --> 37:14.541
Tell me, why did you come tonight,
if you're so certain Aretuza is doomed?

37:15.250 --> 37:19.250
Because you and I aren't like Tissaia.

37:20.916 --> 37:23.583
We break rules. We aren't afraid of power.

37:24.708 --> 37:26.208
There's still hope for you.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.458
Traitors are already working
with Nilfgaard.

37:29.541 --> 37:32.500
-As they always have been.
-Oh, see what you want to see.

37:33.666 --> 37:36.041
But if Tissaia and you stick to this plan,

than poor Lydia.

But Tissaia and I have weathered
our fair share of Brotherhood infighting.

37:52.750 --> 37:55.833
We will triumph tomorrow.
Just like we did at Sodden.

37:56.333 --> 37:59.666
And though I wish you'd have joined us
on the battlefield that day,

38:01.041 --> 38:02.791
we will fight without you again.

When tomorrow's meetings unite the North,
I truly hope you can see

38:07.958 --> 38:10.416
that there are still
some things worth protecting.

Thank you for coming tonight.

38:16.041 --> 38:17.125

38:21.083 --> 38:23.750
Tonight means everything to us as well.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.666
[Yennefer] Maybe she just wanted
to stir up drama.

38:30.333 --> 38:31.833
Wouldn't be her first offense.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.750
It would explain Dijkstra's warning.

38:34.833 --> 38:36.791
They clearly know something we do not.

38:38.458 --> 38:39.666
But why wouldn't she speak up?

38:40.416 --> 38:43.416
Nothing we accused Stregobor of
had anything to do with Nilfgaard.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.041
And why the interest
in a mage who doesn't speak?

38:46.125 --> 38:47.250
I don't know.

38:48.666 --> 38:50.291
Why doesn't Lydia speak?

38:50.875 --> 38:53.625
Her lower jaw is an illusion.
A masterful one.

38:54.375 --> 38:58.125

and now she can no longer speak aloud,

Men, most of all.

41:17.041 --> 41:18.541
Until I became cruel myself.

41:19.875 --> 41:22.291
And rather than remain an unwanted mutant,

41:23.375 --> 41:25.375
I chose to become a sorcerer.

41:26.208 --> 41:27.041
Out of spite.

41:28.041 --> 41:29.625
Be careful, Vilgefortz.

41:30.333 --> 41:33.375
Careful that the similarities
you're so desperately searching for

41:33.458 --> 41:34.791
don't lead you too far.

41:34.875 --> 41:39.208
Oh, not to worry, witcher.
We have but one likeness that remains.

41:39.291 --> 41:43.666
I left that headstrong young boy behind
the day I fell in love with Tissaia.

41:43.750 --> 41:47.375
That bond,
that sense of family, changed me.

41:47.458 --> 41:51.166
And I know the same has happened to you
with Yennefer of Vengerberg.

41:54.166 --> 41:56.708
You seem to know a great many things.

41:56.791 --> 41:59.833
[chuckles] Then tell me
when I reach a mistruth.

42:00.708 --> 42:05.166
The longer Yennefer stays at Aretuza,
the stronger the Brotherhood will be.

42:05.916 --> 42:09.416
The more likely we'll be able to hold off
the powers that threaten the Continent.

42:11.166 --> 42:15.041
Have you… ever been attracted
by the art of sorcery, Geralt?

42:15.916 --> 42:18.125
-Hmm.
-Have you considered joining her here?

42:19.291 --> 42:21.625
If you want to protect what you love,

42:22.208 --> 42:24.166
join our side in the battle to come.

42:27.375 --> 42:29.375
The child will not remain safe for long,

42:29.458 --> 42:33.500
and your… passivity will be no weapon
with which to save her.

42:34.708 --> 42:38.375
It is incredible how much
my neutrality outrages everyone.

42:40.083 --> 42:43.125
How it subjects me
to offers of pacts and agreements

42:43.208 --> 42:46.125
and lectures
of the necessity of making a choice

42:46.208 --> 42:47.916
and joining the right side.

42:49.750 --> 42:52.083
I am not your equal partner in this game.

42:52.166 --> 42:54.708
So, no, I shall continue on my path.

42:55.875 --> 42:57.583
I shall respond to events.

42:57.666 --> 42:59.916
I'll adapt with the world as it changes.

43:00.708 --> 43:04.375
I understand, witcher.
But adapting may not be enough.

43:05.458 --> 43:08.166
Just know there is only one way
you do not lose her.

43:10.625 --> 43:12.416
And if I refuse to join your side?

43:15.625 --> 43:17.916
No matter where you go, what you do,

43:18.750 --> 43:21.458
there will always be
enemies waiting for you.

43:27.166 --> 43:28.291
[chuckles]

43:28.375 --> 43:31.000
Tissaia mentioned
they were together as young mages.

43:33.083 --> 43:34.666
[sighs] First love.

43:36.375 --> 43:37.791
Never goes away, does it?

43:43.000 --> 43:44.166
If you don't mind…

43:45.083 --> 43:46.208
No, not at all.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.708
Best of luck tomorrow
at the conclave, witcher.

43:51.208 --> 43:52.500
[door opens]

43:54.000 --> 43:55.375
[Yennefer] "The battle to come"?

43:56.375 --> 43:58.833
Vilgefortz encouraged this conclave
to ensure peace.

44:00.708 --> 44:02.375
Maybe he didn't think it was possible.

44:05.291 --> 44:06.458
Scarlet ammonite.

44:07.333 --> 44:09.333
Rumored to protect loved ones.

44:09.416 --> 44:10.916
Or valuable property.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.458
Scarlet ammonite is only found
in the mines in West Redania.

44:16.333 --> 44:18.625
That's where I found
those girls locked in that castle.

44:18.708 --> 44:21.333
Geralt, the painting. The First Landing.

44:21.416 --> 44:23.958
It's where that corrupt portal took me
when I was attacked.

44:24.041 --> 44:26.250
There was a black mountain
with water below.

44:26.333 --> 44:27.875
It's Vilgefortz' favorite painting.

44:27.958 --> 44:31.583
He gave Tissaia that bracelet.
And I bet he gave Lydia that jewelry too.

44:34.500 --> 44:35.666
She's in love with him.

44:36.375 --> 44:38.166
"A poison that kills you slowly."

44:39.541 --> 44:41.958
-Stregobor wasn't our man.
-Vilgefortz is.

44:44.791 --> 44:45.708
[speaking in Elder]

44:45.791 --> 44:47.708
-What are you doing?
-Trying to locate Tissaia.

44:47.791 --> 44:50.541
-If she's in danger, I need to know.
-We don't have time.

44:50.625 --> 44:53.833
I'm not leaving her.
Make sure the path is clear.

44:54.708 --> 44:56.041
[speaking in Elder]

44:56.708 --> 44:58.708
[repeating spell]

45:01.250 --> 45:02.875
[distant screams]

45:15.208 --> 45:16.916
[woman] Secure the Great Hall!

45:17.958 --> 45:19.875
Go! Put a man there!

45:22.500 --> 45:24.000
[man shouts]

45:29.750 --> 45:31.625
Should have chosen a side, witcher.
