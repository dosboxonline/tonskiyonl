58:11.139 --> 58:13.098
And at the same time,

58:13.272 --> 58:15.926
we were figuring out this story
about the ceremony and the test.

58:15.927 --> 58:18.756
And I said to the room,
"It would be a special walker."

58:18.886 --> 58:23.108
So if Sylvie happens
to have died at the right time,

58:23.282 --> 58:26.154
then she would be the right one
to use as the walker.

Richman: All the time
we sort of fretted about

58:31.159 --> 58:33.596
telling an actress
that she's going to die.

58:33.597 --> 58:37.339
But the real hardest part
was how, for us,

58:37.470 --> 58:39.951
because her reaction was
she was really excited.

58:40.081 --> 58:42.693
Blanc-Francard:
The fact that Sylvie died
trying to save Laurent,

58:42.823 --> 58:45.738
I think it's the best way
for her to die, honestly.

58:45.739 --> 58:47.698
And I was really excited
to play a zombie.

58:47.872 --> 58:49.961
On "Walking Dead,"
It's the best opportunity

58:50.091 --> 58:50.788
to play a zombie.

They did, like, amazing makeup,

58:56.271 --> 58:59.579
made this prosthetic neck,
as you can see--

58:59.710 --> 59:03.583
goes there-- in silicone,

59:03.714 --> 59:06.978
so to create
like a fake broken neck.

59:07.152 --> 59:10.416
And also synthetic cheekbones
and just sprays me,

59:10.590 --> 59:12.636
like, for two hours.

59:12.766 --> 59:16.378
And after that, you can see
on my hand they did the same.

59:16.509 --> 59:18.076
And they start to draw
on my face

59:18.206 --> 59:20.513
with really,
really thin pencil.

59:20.687 --> 59:22.341
When I saw myself
the first time in the mirror,

59:22.471 --> 59:24.604
honestly,
I was really amazed.

59:24.735 --> 59:27.738
I love the idea
of being transformed

59:27.912 --> 59:30.958
and just be completely different
from myself.

59:31.132 --> 59:32.481
I loved it.

Scigliuzzi: I guess I'm kind of
sad, not as in my character,

59:37.965 --> 59:41.142
but me, 'cause I'm gonna
miss her if she's not on set.

Blanc-Francard: I learned
a lot in the show.

59:43.536 --> 59:46.930
I'm really grateful
in that I'm full of advices

59:46.931 --> 59:49.890
and great memories that you
can't really forget, I think.
