the average citizen,</i>

00:19.845 --> 00:24.502
<i>"Is our society now safer
without those so-called
superheroes?"</i>

00:24.676 --> 00:26.374
<i>I don't miss the masks.</i>

00:26.548 --> 00:29.029
<i>They stirred up more trouble
than they were worth.</i>

00:29.203 --> 00:31.118
<i>The only
good ones were the Minutemen

00:31.292 --> 00:33.337
<i>The blue guy, Manhattan,

00:36.427 --> 00:39.213
<i>Meh, America never really

02:35.372 --> 02:39.420
<i>This city is afraid of me.
I have seen its true face.</i>

02:42.510 --> 02:44.338
<i>The streets
are extended gutters,</i>

02:44.512 --> 02:46.340
<i>and the gutters
are full of blood,</i>

02:46.514 --> 02:49.038
<i>and when the drains
finally scab over,</i>

02:49.212 --> 02:50.561
<i>all the vermin will drown.</i>

02:50.735 --> 02:51.910
Hey! What are ya, blind?

02:52.084 --> 02:53.825
You're walkin'

02:53.999 --> 02:55.436
<i>The accumulated filth

03:02.921 --> 03:06.055
<i>And I'll look down

03:06.229 --> 03:08.057
<i>They had a choice.</i>

03:08.231 --> 03:10.059
<i>They could have followed

03:10.233 --> 03:13.715
<i>Decent men who believed in
a day's work for a day's pay.</i>

03:13.889 --> 03:17.762
<i>Instead, they followed
the droppings of lechers
and communists.</i>

03:17.936 --> 03:20.461
<i>Now the whole world stands

03:20.635 --> 03:22.985

03:23.159 --> 03:25.944
<i>all those intellectuals

03:26.118 --> 03:29.339
<i>And all of a sudden nobody can
think of anything to say.</i>

03:29.513 --> 03:32.864
Hmm, that's quite a drop.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.432
So what do you think
happened here?

03:35.606 --> 03:37.608
Door chain was fastened
on the inside.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.089
Busting it down would
take two guys.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.483
<i>Or one guy on serious drugs.</i>

03:43.658 --> 03:45.616
<i>I saw the body.</i>

03:45.790 --> 03:49.229
<i>This Blake guy looked beefy
enough to protect himself.</i>

03:49.403 --> 03:51.187
<i>Muscles like a weight lifter.</i>

03:51.361 --> 03:54.234
<i>He would've put up
some kind of fight.</i>

03:54.408 --> 03:58.629
Maybe it was a couple
of Knot-Tops and they just
overpowered him.

04:02.372 --> 04:07.290
Background report said
he's been doing overseas
diplomatic work for years...

04:07.464 --> 04:09.945
Lotta classy expense
account living.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.730
Maybe he just got soft.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.389
He don't look
too soft in this photo.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.522
Wonder how he got that scar.

04:21.696 --> 04:24.264
Oh, he's shaking hands
with Vice President Ford here.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.222
I think we can rule him out
as a suspect.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.919
Oh, ha ha.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.922
That'd be funny if we had
any better leads to go on.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.490
I mean, what is this?

04:33.664 --> 04:35.144
<i>A little money stolen,</i>

04:35.318 --> 04:37.668
<i>but no way is this
a straight burglary.</i>

04:40.018 --> 04:42.717
Ah, somebody really
had it in for this guy.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.414
How else did he go
outta the window?

04:45.807 --> 04:47.678
Maybe he tripped against it.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.597
That's strong glass, man.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.120
<i>You'd have to be thrown.</i>

04:59.211 --> 05:01.126
Ground floor comin' up.

05:07.481 --> 05:10.788
Y'know, this could be
just a simple burglary.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.225
Crazy things happen
in a city this size.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.054
They don't all need motives.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.621
So you're saying...

05:17.795 --> 05:21.016
Let's not raise too much dust
over this one.

05:21.190 --> 05:24.585
We don't need any
masked avengers cutting in.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.151
Oy! Here we go!

05:26.326 --> 05:28.589
You take this vigilante
stuff too seriously.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.982
Ever since the
Keene Act passed in '77,

05:31.156 --> 05:34.334
only the government
sponsored weirdos are active.
They don't interfere.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.597
Rorschach never retired!

05:36.771 --> 05:39.251
Even after him and his buddies
fell outta grace.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.732
He's still out there somewhere.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.821
He's crazier
than a snake's armpit

05:43.995 --> 05:46.476
and wanted on
two counts murder one.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.174
We've got a cozy
little homicide here.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.481
If Rorschach gets involved,

05:51.655 --> 05:54.702
we'll be up to our butts
in corpses.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.187
Huh.

07:44.725 --> 07:45.769
Hmm.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.215
So there I was
in the supermarket

07:57.389 --> 07:59.304
buying dog food
for old Phantom here...

07:59.479 --> 08:01.742
I turn the corner and WHAM!

08:01.916 --> 08:04.527
I bump into
the Screaming Skull.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.050
You remember him?

08:06.224 --> 08:08.444
I heard you mention him...

08:08.618 --> 08:10.664
Put him away a dozen times.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.883
He'd reformed
and turned to Jesus.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.363
Married, two kids.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.800
We traded addresses. Nice guy.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.763
Oh, Hollis, almost midnight.
I outta go.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.113
Oh, sure, Dan,
lost track of the time there,

08:25.287 --> 08:27.158
talking about
all that old stuff.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.421
You must be bored as hell.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.423
You know better than that.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.904
These Saturday night
beer sessions are what
keep me going.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.995
You know, it was a cryin' shame

08:38.169 --> 08:40.694
they put you youngsters out
to grass in '77.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.218
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was.

08:43.392 --> 08:46.874
Hollis, we both know that's
bullshit. But thank you anyway.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.963
Hey, watch the language!

08:49.137 --> 08:51.226
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis, remember?

08:51.400 --> 08:55.056
Goodnight!
Don't forget to lock up
and take care of yourself.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.145
You too, Danny. God bless.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.411
Hmm.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.448
Where you goin' pig?

09:39.622 --> 09:42.016
- The party's right here!
- Oh yeah!

09:44.235 --> 09:46.629
Hit us with more
of those Katie's, Derf!

09:46.803 --> 09:48.239
Yeah, I'm comin' down
already, man.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.199
You never
could keep it up.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.334
Hey, let's go break
some shit, huh!

09:58.598 --> 10:00.904
- I wanna get crazy!
- Aw, yeah!

10:01.078 --> 10:03.080
Call up your boys, Derf!

10:03.254 --> 10:04.908
Fire it up!

10:41.728 --> 10:42.990
Hello, Daniel.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.775
- Rorschach?
- Got hungry waiting.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.255
Helped myself to some beans.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.517
Hope you don't mind.

10:48.691 --> 10:52.913
No, no of course I don't mind.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.175
You want me to heat
those up for you?

10:54.349 --> 10:56.438
No need. Fine like this.

10:58.005 --> 11:01.051
So... long time no see.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.618
How've you been keeping?

11:02.792 --> 11:05.534
Out of prison, so far.
Take a look at this.

11:08.145 --> 11:11.627
This stain...
is that bean juice or--

11:11.801 --> 11:13.803
Yeah... human bean juice.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.675
Badge belonged to the Comedian.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.633
Blood too. He's dead.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.504
Wait. The Comedian?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.550
Investigated
a routine homicide.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.639
Victim named Edward Blake.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.989
Found the costume
in Blake's wardrobe.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.774
Seems he was the Comedian.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.037
Somebody threw him
out of a window.

11:32.648 --> 11:36.043
Um, maybe we should
talk about this
down in my workshop.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.785
Right down this way.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.222
You haven't been
down here in a while.

11:41.396 --> 11:44.312
Neither have you. Lots of dust.

11:53.451 --> 11:54.714
Oh!

11:54.888 --> 11:58.065
Uh, listen...
about the Comedian,

11:58.239 --> 12:00.937
might it have been
just an ordinary
burglary or something?

12:01.111 --> 12:03.331
Maybe the killer didn't
even know who Blake was.

12:03.505 --> 12:06.247
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian?

12:06.421 --> 12:07.596
Ridiculous.

12:09.511 --> 12:13.863
Well, I hear he'd been working
for the government since '77,

12:14.037 --> 12:17.606
knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.304
- Maybe this was
a political killing.
- Maybe.

12:20.478 --> 12:24.047
Or maybe someone's
picking off costumed heroes.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.746
Don't you think that's
maybe a little paranoid?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.618
That what they're
saying about me now?
That I'm paranoid?

12:29.792 --> 12:32.142
The Comedian was active
for 40 years.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.231
Men make a lot of enemies
in that time.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.581
How's your friend Hollis Mason
these days?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.801
Hollis? What does he--

12:38.975 --> 12:40.847
They were both Minutemen,
when Blake was 16

12:41.021 --> 12:43.110
and Hollis
was the first Nite Owl.

12:43.284 --> 12:46.243
Hollis said some bad things
about the Comedian
in that book he wrote.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.810
I don't like what
you're implying.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.030
Hollis is an old man,
and he's my friend.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.032
If you're thinking of going
over there and scaring him--

12:52.206 --> 12:55.252
Implying nothing,
only an observation.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.906
I just wanted to let you know,

12:57.080 --> 12:59.213
in case someone's
gunning for masks.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.748
Better go now.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.881
Things to do.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.578
The tunnel will bring you out
to a warehouse two blocks
north--

13:16.752 --> 13:18.319
I remember.

13:18.493 --> 13:21.409
Used to come here often
back when we were partners.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.020
Those were great times, Rorschach.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.935
- Whatever happened to them?
- You quit.

13:44.171 --> 13:48.740
We want cops! No more costumes!

13:48.915 --> 13:52.396
Listen, you little punks!
You better get back
in your rat holes!

13:52.570 --> 13:55.399
I got riot gas,
I got rubber bullets--

13:55.573 --> 13:57.793
- There's no need for this!
- Fuck you, Owl!

13:57.967 --> 14:00.143
The police strike is being
negotiated right now!

14:00.317 --> 14:01.928
You vigilantes belong in jail!

14:02.102 --> 14:04.321
My son's a police officer,
you freaks!

14:04.495 --> 14:05.670
Call yourself a Comedian?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.238
More like pig and rapist!

14:08.412 --> 14:09.500
Okay, that does it!

14:11.285 --> 14:13.635
Oh my God,
he just shot him!

14:13.809 --> 14:17.595
God, look, I'm sorry.
You haven't left us any choice.

14:17.769 --> 14:21.034
This stuff is dangerous.
Please clear the streets!

14:21.208 --> 14:22.078
Look at 'em!

14:23.384 --> 14:25.299
Run, you suckers!

14:25.473 --> 14:26.822
This is a nightmare!

14:26.996 --> 14:28.389
The whole country's
erupting like this.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.521
How long can we keep this up?

14:30.695 --> 14:34.569
My contacts say
Senator Keene's act is
gonna shut us all down.

14:34.743 --> 14:38.138
Until then, we're society's
only protection.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.010
Protection? From who?

14:41.184 --> 14:43.621
From themselves.

14:43.795 --> 14:47.582
What-- What happened
to the American dream?

14:47.756 --> 14:51.107
It came true.
You're looking at it.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.589
Now let's really put
these jokers through
some changes.

15:14.348 --> 15:18.918
<i>Rorschach's Journal.
October 13th, 1985.</i>

15:19.092 --> 15:24.140
<i>Slept all day. Awakened
by landlady complaining
about the smell.</i>

15:24.314 --> 15:27.796
<i>She has five children
by five different fathers.</i>

15:27.970 --> 15:29.929
<i>I'm sure she cheats on welfare.</i>

15:35.673 --> 15:37.458
<i>Soon it will be dark.</i>

15:41.897 --> 15:45.248
<i>On Friday night,
a Comedian died in New York.</i>

15:45.422 --> 15:49.774
<i>Somebody knows why.
Somebody knows.</i>

15:49.949 --> 15:51.820
Get lost, you creep!

15:51.994 --> 15:53.953
<i>I believe I shall
take my exercise.</i>

16:07.053 --> 16:10.230
Huh, Rorschach!
Hey, how you doin', fella?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.493
I'm fine, Happy Harry.
Yourself?

16:12.667 --> 16:16.976
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Just fine and... uh...

16:18.542 --> 16:22.111
Oh, God,
please don't kill anybody.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.722
Guy went sidewalk diving
Friday night.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.855
I don't think he was alone
when it happened.

16:27.029 --> 16:30.337
His name was Edward Blake.
Friend of mine.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.773
You hear that?

16:32.600 --> 16:33.731
He's got friends.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.429
Must've changed his deodorant!

16:42.958 --> 16:45.047
I... I didn't mean
anything, I--

16:46.831 --> 16:49.704
I've just broken
this gentleman's little finger.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.227
Who killed Edward Blake?

16:53.882 --> 16:56.493
Who killed Edward Blake?

16:57.842 --> 16:59.366
And his index finger.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.368
- Who killed Edward Blake?
- We don't know.

17:01.542 --> 17:05.111
Please, God, leave him alone!
We don't know!

17:06.677 --> 17:09.071
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

17:12.074 --> 17:16.252
<i>Nobody knew anything.
Feeling slightly depressed.</i>

17:16.426 --> 17:21.388
<i>I leave the human cockroaches
to discuss their heroin
and child pornography.</i>

17:21.562 --> 17:25.174
<i>I have business
with a better class of person.</i>

17:26.436 --> 17:29.874
The Comedian is dead? Why?

17:30.049 --> 17:34.357
You're supposed to be
the world's smartest man,
Veidt. You tell me.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.881
I never claimed to be
anybody special, Rorschach.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.408
I just have some
over-enthusiastic P.R. men.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.236
Perhaps it was
a political killing.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.760
- Maybe the Soviets...
- Dreiberg said the same.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.544
America has Dr. Manhattan.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.373
Reds would never
dare antagonize us.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.159
I think we've got
a mask-killer.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.465
The Comedian had
plenty of other
political enemies,

17:55.639 --> 17:57.554
even discounting the Russians.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.426
The man was practically a Nazi.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.211
He stood up for his country.
Never let anyone retire him.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.387
Never cashed in
on his reputation.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.695
Never set up a company
selling posters and diet books

18:07.869 --> 18:09.349
and toy soldiers
based on himself.

18:09.523 --> 18:12.178
Never became a prostitute.

18:12.352 --> 18:16.095
If that makes him a Nazi,
you might as well call me
a Nazi too.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.140
Rorschach...

18:19.576 --> 18:21.578
I know we were never friends,

18:21.752 --> 18:24.146
but even so
you're being unfair.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.192
Nobody retired me.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.716
I chose to quit adventuring
and go public

18:28.890 --> 18:31.719
two years before
the police strike made
the Keene Act necessary.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.677
Yes. Good timing.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.158
I came here to warn you
about the mask-killer

18:36.332 --> 18:39.640
so you don't end up
the smartest man
in the morgue.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.816
But I guess there's
worse things to end up as.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.124
Be seeing you.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.128
Sure.

18:49.954 --> 18:50.955
Have a nice day.

18:57.919 --> 19:03.272
Now, I want to thank everyone
for coming to the first meeting
of the Crimebusters.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.188
For those who know me
only as Captain Metropolis,

19:06.362 --> 19:08.538
the name's Nelson Gardner.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.366
Call me Nelson.

19:12.629 --> 19:15.154
As you know, this country
hasn't had an organization

19:15.328 --> 19:18.026
of masked adventurers
in over 20 years,

19:18.200 --> 19:20.507
since the Minutemen
were disbanded.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.510
Specialized law enforcement
is standing still.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.121
Crime isn't.

19:26.295 --> 19:29.298
New social evils emerge
every day:

19:29.472 --> 19:33.259
promiscuity, drugs,
campus subversion, you name it.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.653
But, by banding together
as Crimebusters,

19:36.827 --> 19:38.438
- we can make a--
- Bullshit.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.180
We're all livin' in 1966

19:41.354 --> 19:43.660
while you're
still stuck in '49.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.314
This is all about
you getting old

19:45.488 --> 19:48.230
but still wanting to play
cowboys and Indians.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.841
Th--That's-- That is not true.

19:51.015 --> 19:54.062
Uh, no reason to just
throw the idea away.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.760
Me and Rorschach have
made great headway
into the gang problem

19:56.934 --> 19:58.675
by pooling our efforts.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.939
But a group this size seems
more like a publicity exercise.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.463
Too big and unwieldy.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.378
That's just
an organizational problem.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.206
With the right person
coordinating the group--

20:07.380 --> 20:11.166
Oh, and who would that be?
Any ideas, Ozzy?

20:11.340 --> 20:15.170
I mean, you are the smartest
man in the world, right?

20:15.344 --> 20:18.086
It doesn't take
a genius to see that
America has problems

20:18.260 --> 20:19.827
that need tackling.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.698
And it takes a moron to think
they're small enough

20:21.872 --> 20:23.700
for clowns like you guys
to handle.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.181
None of the world's problems
are insurmountable.

20:26.355 --> 20:30.620
What's going down
in this world, you got no idea!

20:35.973 --> 20:38.367
Believe me.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.196
You people hear Moloch's back
in town and you think,

20:41.370 --> 20:44.373
"Oh, boy! Let's gang up
and bust him!"

20:44.547 --> 20:47.115
Like that matters.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.030
It doesn't mean squat!

20:49.204 --> 20:53.426
In 30 years the nukes are
gonna be flying like maybugs...

20:53.600 --> 20:55.602
My map!

20:55.776 --> 21:00.998
And Ozzy here is gonna be
the smartest man on the cinder.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.872
Jon, I'd like to go home now.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.308
- Please.
- Listen, Nelson,

21:06.482 --> 21:08.702
maybe this isn't
the best idea...

21:08.876 --> 21:11.270
No, wait, don't leave.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.141
Somebody has to do it...

21:13.315 --> 21:15.404
Somebody has to save the world!

21:57.968 --> 22:00.754
<i>Meeting with Veidt
left bad taste in mouth.</i>

22:00.928 --> 22:02.973
<i>He is pampered and decadent,</i>

22:03.147 --> 22:06.455
<i>betraying even his own shallow,
liberal affectations.</i>

22:06.629 --> 22:08.979
<i>Dreiberg just as bad.</i>

22:09.153 --> 22:11.765
<i>A flabby failure whimpering
in his basement.</i>

22:11.939 --> 22:14.637
<i>Why are there so few
of the Minutemen left active,</i>

22:14.811 --> 22:18.293
<i>healthy and without
personality disorders?</i>

22:18.467 --> 22:21.296
<i>The first Nite Owl runs
an auto repair shop.</i>

22:21.470 --> 22:24.734
<i>Captain Metropolis
was decapitated
in a car crash.</i>

22:27.737 --> 22:31.001
<i>The first Silk Specter
is a bloated, aging whore...</i>

22:31.175 --> 22:34.178
<i>Dying in a California
rest resort.</i>

22:34.353 --> 22:37.138
<i>Mothman's in an asylum
up in Maine.</i>

22:37.312 --> 22:39.836
<i>The Silhouette retired
in disgrace.</i>

22:40.010 --> 22:44.188
<i>Murdered six weeks later
by a minor adversary
seeking revenge.</i>

22:44.363 --> 22:46.234
<i>Dollar Bill got shot.</i>

22:46.408 --> 22:48.932
<i>Hooded Justice went missing.</i>

22:49.106 --> 22:50.934
<i>The Comedian is dead.</i>

22:51.108 --> 22:53.589
<i>And now I must tell
the indestructible man</i>

22:53.763 --> 22:55.809
<i>that someone
plans to murder him.</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:04.905
Good evening, Rorschach.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.733
Good evening, Dr. Manhattan.

23:11.346 --> 23:13.304
What're you doing here,
Rorschach?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.655
Aren't you still wanted
by the police?

23:15.829 --> 23:17.570
Good evening, Miss Jupiter.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.136
That's Juspeczyk.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.922
Jupiter was my mother's
publicity name.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.532
Apologies.

23:23.706 --> 23:26.013
Came to warn you both
and bring bad news.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.797
The Comedian is dead.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.800
Yes. He and I are the only
two extranormal operatives

23:30.974 --> 23:34.369
employed by the government,
so I was informed at once.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.850
You don't seem too concerned
about Blake's death.

23:37.024 --> 23:40.941
A live body and a dead body
contain the same number
of particles.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.552
Structurally there's no
discernible difference.

23:43.726 --> 23:47.426
Life and death
are unquantifiable abstracts.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.036
Why should I be concerned?

23:49.210 --> 23:51.255
Besides, Blake was a monster.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.736
You know he tried to rape
my mother when they were
both Minutemen?

23:53.910 --> 23:56.304
I'm not here to speculate
on the moral lapses

23:56.478 --> 23:59.220
of men who died
in their country's service.
I came to warn--

23:59.394 --> 24:02.441
Moral lapses?
He broke her ribs! He--

24:05.095 --> 24:07.228
Jon, get this creep
out of here.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.710
You seem to be
upsetting Laurie.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.276
I think you ought to go.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.843
With respect, Dr. Manhattan,

24:14.017 --> 24:15.932
I believe someone
is eliminating masks.

24:16.106 --> 24:18.152
I warned Veidt and Dreiberg
and I intend--

24:18.326 --> 24:20.154
I said I think you ought to go.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.590
Not before I've had my--

24:23.462 --> 24:24.463
Say.

24:30.991 --> 24:31.992
Hmm.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.304
He's gone. Are you still upset?

24:41.784 --> 24:42.611
Jon?

24:44.657 --> 24:47.877
Hey, I was thinking,

24:48.051 --> 24:50.924
I must be really on edge
to let a maggot like Rorschach
get to me like that.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.229
Maybe we--

24:53.970 --> 24:56.495
Maybe I could use a night out.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.063
Rorschach mentioned
Dan Dreiberg.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.152
Haven't seen him in years.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.764
Maybe I'll call him up,
ask him to dinner.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.724
If you don't mind, that is.

25:08.898 --> 25:09.986
Of course not.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.518
<i>It is October, 1985.</i>

25:19.692 --> 25:21.476
<i>I am close to locating
a gluino,</i>

25:21.650 --> 25:24.261
<i>which would completely validate
super symmetrical theory.</i>

25:29.484 --> 25:32.008
<i>It is May, 1971.</i>

25:40.016 --> 25:43.672
<i>Having been asked to intervene
in Vietnam by President Nixon,</i>

25:43.846 --> 25:47.328
<i>I am deployed alongside
Edward Blake, the Comedian.</i>

25:49.199 --> 25:52.246
<i>I have never met anyone
so deliberately amoral.</i>

25:54.291 --> 25:56.816
<i>What Vietnam implies
about the human condition,</i>

25:56.990 --> 26:00.384
<i>few humans will permit
themselves to understand.</i>

26:00.559 --> 26:02.604
<i>But Blake is different.</i>

26:02.778 --> 26:04.693
<i>He understands perfectly.</i>

26:05.825 --> 26:07.174
<i>And he doesn't care.</i>

26:09.568 --> 26:13.397
The average
Vietnamese doesn't give
a damn who won this war.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.487
But it means plenty
to the US of A.

26:16.662 --> 26:20.970
If we'd lost, I think
it might've driven
the country a little crazy.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.756
Thanks to you, we didn't.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.627
Yet you sound so bitter.

26:25.801 --> 26:29.022
You have some strange attitudes
toward life and war.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.589
Strange?

26:30.763 --> 26:32.634
Once you figure out
everything's a joke,

26:32.808 --> 26:35.637
being a Comedian
is the only thing
that makes sense.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.160
The charred villages,

26:37.334 --> 26:40.599
the boys with necklaces
of human ears...

26:40.773 --> 26:43.079
these are part of the joke?

26:43.253 --> 26:45.560
Never said it was a good joke.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.650
I'm just playing
along with the gag.
Same as him.

26:48.824 --> 26:53.002
First press helicopter
into Saigon since
the cease fire.

26:53.176 --> 26:56.005
Oh, he's got the next election
in the bag.

26:56.179 --> 26:59.618
Me, I'm taking
the first chopper out.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.490
I hate this place.

27:02.664 --> 27:07.538
The temperature, the smell,
this rotten, cheap bourbon--

27:07.713 --> 27:09.976
- Mr. Eddie?
- Oh, God.

27:11.542 --> 27:14.763
Now war is over,
I must talk to you.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.374
Nothing to talk about.
I'm leaving.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.115
And... and what of me?

27:19.289 --> 27:23.380
I cannot just walk away
from what grow in my belly.

27:23.554 --> 27:24.947
- I cannot forget!
- Too bad,

27:25.121 --> 27:26.906
because that's what
I intend to do.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.385
Forget you,

27:28.559 --> 27:30.257
your cruddy little country,
all of it.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.349
I do not think so.

27:35.523 --> 27:38.526
I think you remember me
and my country.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.921
You remember
as long as you live.

27:45.576 --> 27:46.795
My face!

27:48.275 --> 27:50.843
Filthy, stinking,

27:51.017 --> 27:52.627
- worthless...
- Blake, don't--

27:55.543 --> 27:58.807
Medic. Gotta find
a goddamn medic.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.374
She was pregnant.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.071
- You gunned her down.
- That's right.

28:02.245 --> 28:03.551
And you know what?

28:03.725 --> 28:05.031
You watched me.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.989
You coulda turned
the gun into steam,

28:07.163 --> 28:10.384
the bullets into mercury
or the bottle into snowflakes!

28:10.558 --> 28:12.560
You coulda teleported her
to goddamn Australia,

28:12.734 --> 28:15.171
but you didn't lift a finger.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.478
You let it happen.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.219
I've watched you.

28:19.393 --> 28:22.570
You don't really give a damn
about human beings.

28:22.744 --> 28:23.832
You never cared
about Janey Slater

28:24.006 --> 28:26.139
even before you ditched her.

28:26.313 --> 28:31.187
Soon you won't be
interested in Sally Jupiter's
little gal, either.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.407
You're drifting
outta touch, Doc.

28:34.277 --> 28:35.975
God help us all.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.298
- Hello?
<i>- H-hello?</i>

28:55.472 --> 28:57.779
<i>- Dan? Uh, this is--</i>
- Laurie?

28:57.953 --> 28:59.563
Laurie Juspeczyk!

28:59.738 --> 29:03.829
<i>Hey, it's been awhile.
How-- How are you?</i>

29:07.136 --> 29:10.183
<i>Rorschach's Journal. 11:30 p.m.</i>

29:10.357 --> 29:13.055
<i>Yesterday a Comedian died
in New York.</i>

29:13.229 --> 29:15.144
<i>Nobody cares but me.</i>

29:15.318 --> 29:18.234
<i>Are they right? Is it futile?</i>

29:18.408 --> 29:20.149
<i>Soon there will be war.</i>

29:20.323 --> 29:24.066
<i>Millions will perish and burn
in sickness and misery.</i>

29:24.240 --> 29:27.722
<i>Why does one death matter
against so many?</i>

29:27.896 --> 29:30.246
<i>Because there is good,
and there is evil,</i>

29:30.420 --> 29:34.033
<i>and evil must be punished.</i>

29:34.207 --> 29:39.168
<i>Even in the face of Armageddon
I shall not compromise on this.</i>

29:39.342 --> 29:43.042
<i>But there are so many
deserving of retribution,</i>

29:43.216 --> 29:44.565
<i>and so little time.</i>

29:52.268 --> 29:54.618
Oh wow, look at the time.
It's getting pretty late.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.926
Oh, I'm in
no hurry to get back.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.667
The government
only keeps me around

29:59.841 --> 30:02.017
so Jon stays relaxed and happy.

30:04.150 --> 30:07.022
Is, uh, everything okay
with you two?

30:07.196 --> 30:09.503
Fine. Couldn't be better.

30:12.985 --> 30:17.250
It's just, I'm 35, Dan,

30:17.424 --> 30:22.037
and all I can think is...
what have I done with my life?

30:22.211 --> 30:24.561
I've spent
eight years semi-retired,

30:24.735 --> 30:28.435
preceded by 10 years
running around
in a stupid costume

30:28.609 --> 30:31.394
because my stupid mother
wanted me to.

30:31.568 --> 30:35.877
Short skirt, neckline going
all the way down to my navel...

30:36.051 --> 30:40.447
- so dreadful.
- Oh, yeah... dreadful.

30:40.621 --> 30:43.406
The Keene Act
was the best thing that
ever happened to us.

30:44.930 --> 30:48.107
Yeah, you're probably right.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.681
Hey, remember that guy

30:57.856 --> 30:59.683
who used to pretend to be
a super-villain

30:59.858 --> 31:01.163
so he could get beaten up?

31:01.337 --> 31:04.514
Oh, um...
Captain Carnage!

31:04.688 --> 31:07.126
Yes!

31:07.300 --> 31:09.432
Ya know, I caught him
running out of a jewelers.

31:09.606 --> 31:10.956
I didn't know
what his racket was,

31:11.130 --> 31:12.871
so I start hitting him
and I'm thinking,

31:13.045 --> 31:15.438
"Jeez, he's breathing
awfully hard."

31:15.612 --> 31:17.571
"Maybe he has asthma."

31:17.745 --> 31:19.051
He tried that
with me too,

31:19.225 --> 31:21.357
but I'd heard about him,
so I walked away.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.012
He followed me down the street
saying "Punish me!"

31:24.186 --> 31:26.145
I'm saying, "No, get lost!"

31:26.319 --> 31:29.235
What ever
happened to him?

31:29.409 --> 31:30.889
He--
he pulled that on Rorschach

31:31.063 --> 31:33.065
and Rorschach dropped him
down an elevator shaft.

31:36.633 --> 31:39.288
Oh, God,
that's not funny.

31:39.462 --> 31:43.336
No, no, I guess not...

31:45.512 --> 31:46.687
That felt good.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.170
Not a lot of laughs around
these days.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.694
Well, what do you expect?

31:54.695 --> 31:56.131
The Comedian is dead.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.189
Oh, look at her,

32:10.363 --> 32:14.106
<i>pretty as a picture
and still keeping her figure.</i>

32:14.280 --> 32:18.066
So what brings you
to the city of the dead?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.895
Being lazy isn't
a terminal condition, mother,

32:21.069 --> 32:23.463
so spare me
the city of the dead crap.

32:23.637 --> 32:24.464
Brought you some flowers.

32:24.638 --> 32:27.423
Oh, big spender!

32:27.597 --> 32:28.511
So where's Jon?

32:30.122 --> 32:33.777
He had to go to some
official funeral.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.215
<i>Made him put on pants
and everything.</i>

32:36.389 --> 32:39.870
<i>I didn't feel like going
so he transported me
here to California.</i>

32:40.045 --> 32:42.482
Teleporting
always makes me sick.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.832
It's Eddie Blake's funeral,
isn't it?

32:45.006 --> 32:47.443
I saw in the paper.
He got murdered.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.446
Poor Eddie.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.274
How can you say "Poor Eddie"
after he almost--

32:52.448 --> 32:55.364
What happened was 40 years ago.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.976
It's history.

32:58.150 --> 33:02.154
Gettin' old, you get
a different perspective.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.896
<i>The big stuff
looks smaller somehow.</i>

33:06.071 --> 33:10.162
<i>Ya know, that makes just
three of us Minutemen left now.</i>

33:10.336 --> 33:14.775
<i>Me, Hollis and poor Byron
at the asylum in Maine.</i>

33:14.949 --> 33:16.690
<i>Eddie was the youngest.</i>

33:16.864 --> 33:18.561
The Comedian.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.869
Always jokin'
that he'd bury us all.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.872
Always thought
he'd get the last...

33:25.046 --> 33:28.484
laugh.

33:28.658 --> 33:31.270
You and Jon oughta
move out here for the weather.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.141
Lots of sunshine!

33:33.315 --> 33:34.838
What the hell is this?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.971
What are you doing
with this creepy pervert art?

33:37.145 --> 33:39.539
Oh, just some old memorabilia.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.411
Being reminded
that people used to
slobber over me

33:42.585 --> 33:44.935
- is kind of flattering.
- Flattering?

33:45.110 --> 33:48.243
Laurie, I'm 65.

33:48.417 --> 33:52.204
Every day the future
looks a little bit darker.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.510
But the past...

33:54.684 --> 33:56.947
even the grimy parts of it,

33:58.427 --> 34:00.386
keep getting brighter
all the time.

34:07.306 --> 34:09.569
Okay, that's it!
Nice picture, folks!

34:09.743 --> 34:12.006
Finally,
I can scratch my armpit.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.747
Got spots in my eyes.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.227
Here lemme take a look,

34:15.401 --> 34:17.751
maybe I can
fish 'em out for you.

34:17.925 --> 34:21.189
Oh, Eddie,
give me a break.

34:21.363 --> 34:22.582
Okay everybody,
we're good.

34:22.756 --> 34:24.366
So let's meet
in the lobby in five.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.585
We'll go back
to the Owl's Nest
for a beer.

34:25.759 --> 34:28.196
You go on ahead,
I gotta change.

34:46.258 --> 34:47.563
- Hi.
- Eddie,

34:47.737 --> 34:49.087
what are you doing here?

34:49.261 --> 34:50.566
You knew I was changing...

34:50.740 --> 34:53.787
Sure did. You announced it
loud enough.

34:53.961 --> 34:57.878
C'mon, baby.
I know what you need...

34:58.052 --> 35:00.750
know why you wear
an outfit like that.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.665
Eddie, no--

35:02.839 --> 35:05.799
Spelled Y-E-S.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.061
Spelled N-O!

35:13.633 --> 35:15.939
Eddie...

35:26.820 --> 35:29.301
What... what's happening?

35:29.475 --> 35:30.824
Eddie, what are you doing?

35:30.998 --> 35:33.261
You sick little bastard!

35:35.437 --> 35:38.048
I'm going to break your neck!

35:52.019 --> 35:54.369
This is what you like,
isn't it?

35:54.543 --> 35:56.980
This is what gets you hot.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.418
Get out.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.942
Oh, sure. Sure, I'm going.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.119
But I got your number...

36:05.293 --> 36:07.077
And one of these days,

36:07.252 --> 36:09.558
the joke's gonna be on you.

36:14.650 --> 36:17.349
Thou hast set
our misdeeds before thee,

36:17.523 --> 36:22.049
and our secret sins
in the light
of thy countenance.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.922
As much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy

36:26.096 --> 36:30.710
to take unto himself
the soul of our dear brother
here departed.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.234
We therefore commit his body
to the ground,

36:33.408 --> 36:39.501
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

36:39.675 --> 36:44.202
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

36:44.376 --> 36:51.252
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

36:51.426 --> 36:54.212
Give us this day
our daily bread,

36:54.386 --> 36:55.865
and forgive us our trespasses

36:56.039 --> 36:59.739
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.481
And lead us not
into temptation,

37:02.655 --> 37:04.526
but deliver us from evil.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.180
Amen.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.962
Edgar William Jacobi.
Also known as Moloch.

37:49.136 --> 37:50.572
I don't know what
you're talking about,

37:50.746 --> 37:51.704
you've got the wrong person,

37:51.878 --> 37:53.053
I'm a retired businessman.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.621
Lying. Do it again, broken arm.

37:55.795 --> 37:58.058
Oh, God, I spent
the '70s in jail.

37:58.232 --> 37:59.581
I'm not Moloch anymore.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.627
I just want to be left alone.

38:03.019 --> 38:04.717
You attended
funeral today. Why?

38:04.891 --> 38:07.589
I... just felt I should.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.548
I've been thinking
about the Comedian a lot--

38:09.722 --> 38:11.289
How do you know Edward Blake
was the Comedian?

38:11.463 --> 38:13.595
He broke in to see me
two weeks ago!

38:13.769 --> 38:15.162
His mask was off!

38:15.336 --> 38:17.599
Enemies for 40 years!
Why should he visit you?

38:17.773 --> 38:18.992
I don't know!

38:19.166 --> 38:21.473
I just woke up
and he was there!

38:21.647 --> 38:23.257
I thought he was
going to kill me.

38:23.431 --> 38:26.913
He was drunk,
not making sense--

38:28.088 --> 38:30.482
It's a joke.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.571
It's all a joke.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.964
I thought I knew
how the world was,

38:35.138 --> 38:37.967
but then I found out
about this gag,

38:38.141 --> 38:40.100
this joke...

38:40.274 --> 38:42.972
You're part of it, Moloch,
old pal, you know that?

38:43.146 --> 38:46.628
I saw your name on the list,
you and Janey Slater.

38:46.802 --> 38:49.588
If I thought you were
in on this, I'd kill you, understand?

38:49.762 --> 38:52.155
I mean, you fought
that big blue geek.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.070
You know what his head's like.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.246
Who knows which way
he'll jump if anyone
messes with him?

38:58.379 --> 39:01.295
I never shoulda looked
out that airship window.

39:01.469 --> 39:02.862
Never seen that island.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.038
Never got involved.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.780
See, on that island,

39:07.954 --> 39:11.566
they got writers and artists
and scientists,

39:11.740 --> 39:14.787
and what they're doing
is just...

39:19.400 --> 39:21.794
I've done some bad things.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.710
Did bad things to women.

39:24.884 --> 39:27.669
Shot kids in 'Nam...

39:27.843 --> 39:33.240
but I never did anything
like... like...

39:33.414 --> 39:36.896
Oh, mother.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.419
Forgive me.

39:38.593 --> 39:42.118
Forgive me, forgive me,
forgive me...

39:42.292 --> 39:44.991
It's a joke.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.601
But I don't get it!

39:46.775 --> 39:48.690
What's so goddamned funny!

39:48.864 --> 39:50.431
Somebody explain it to me!

39:50.605 --> 39:53.521
Somebody please
explain it to me.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.784
And then he left.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.873
I don't know what
the hell it was about.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.658
Hmm.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.050
Funny story.

40:01.224 --> 40:02.400
Sounds unbelievable.

40:02.574 --> 40:03.792
Probably true.

40:03.966 --> 40:06.665
So that's it?

40:06.839 --> 40:08.362
- I'm clean?
- No.

40:08.536 --> 40:10.103
Searched house
before you got back.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.105
Found phony medication.

40:12.279 --> 40:13.585
Outlawed years ago.

40:16.065 --> 40:21.331
Well, when you're desperate,
you'll try anything.

40:21.506 --> 40:25.205
I... I have cancer.

40:25.379 --> 40:28.251
Cancer? What kind?

40:28.426 --> 40:31.646
You know the kind of cancer
you eventually get better from?

40:33.518 --> 40:34.736
This ain't it.

40:38.523 --> 40:41.743
Wrote down name of company.
Will report them later.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.485
You're off the hook for now.

40:44.659 --> 40:45.834
Stay out of trouble.

<i>Rorschach's Journal.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.414
<i>Thought about Moloch's story

<i>Is this what happens to us?</i>

41:20.782 --> 41:23.568
<i>A life of conflict with

43:31.391 --> 43:37.876
<i>amongst dead men and...
the pieces of dead men.</i>

43:38.050 --> 43:39.834
I'm informed on these things.

43:40.008 --> 43:41.836
I see every paper in the world.

43:42.010 --> 43:44.273
See, everything's connected.

43:44.447 --> 43:46.667
<i>I begged that the gulls
should take my eyes...</i>

43:46.841 --> 43:49.278
A news vendor
understands that reality.

43:49.452 --> 43:51.367
<i>...thus sparing me the horrors.</i>

43:51.541 --> 43:53.631
The weight o' the world's
on him, but he can take it.

43:53.805 --> 43:56.242
<i>But at least I was alive.</i>

43:56.416 --> 43:58.070
He's a survivor.

43:58.244 --> 44:00.463
<i>And I knew that life
had no worse news to offer me.</i>

44:00.638 --> 44:01.508
Good afternoon.

44:02.552 --> 44:04.380
Is it here yet?

44:04.554 --> 44:06.382
Oh! Your copy of today's
<i>New Frontiersman,</i> coming up.

44:06.556 --> 44:09.211
I keep it for ya
every day, don't I? Uh...

44:10.952 --> 44:13.085
Hey, how's the end
of the world coming?

44:13.259 --> 44:15.565
Today for certain.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.872
You won't forget to keep
my paper for me tomorrow?

44:18.046 --> 44:19.569
Sure will!

44:19.744 --> 44:21.397
<i>I had a sudden memory</i>

44:21.571 --> 44:23.443
<i>of clinging fast to someone
through the tempest.</i>

44:24.662 --> 44:26.925
<i>Our fateful ship's figurehead,</i>

44:27.099 --> 44:29.057
<i>now lying at my feet,</i>

44:29.231 --> 44:33.366
<i>blindfolded by seaweed, smiling.</i>

44:33.540 --> 44:36.195
<i>I thought better
of removing the kelp
from her eyes,</i>

44:36.369 --> 44:41.940
<i>not wishing her to suffer
the terrible distractions
of that grim tideline.</i>

44:42.114 --> 44:44.986
<i>She had borne me
through seas of blood,</i>

44:45.160 --> 44:48.120
<i>had nourished me
in the heart of the storm.</i>

44:48.294 --> 44:52.167
<i>This small comfort
was all I could offer,</i>

44:52.341 --> 44:55.301
<i>for I could not love her
as she had loved me.</i>

45:02.308 --> 45:05.354
Mmm... Jon...

45:05.528 --> 45:08.444
don't you have to do
a TV interview soon?

45:08.618 --> 45:12.100
No. We have plenty of time.

45:12.274 --> 45:13.667
Laurie?

45:13.841 --> 45:16.888
Oh, God! Jon,
just be one person again!

45:17.062 --> 45:20.718
Don't be upset. I'm sorry.
I thought you'd enjoy it.

45:20.892 --> 45:22.328
I was just trying
to please you.

45:22.502 --> 45:23.677
I-I-I know.

45:23.851 --> 45:26.636
I know. I'm sorry
I over-reacted.

45:26.811 --> 45:29.465
You just startled me is all.

45:29.639 --> 45:30.771
I'm fine. It doesn't--

45:34.427 --> 45:35.733
Laurie?

45:35.907 --> 45:38.779
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

45:38.953 --> 45:40.825
This whole time
you've been working out here

45:40.999 --> 45:42.478
while we were in bed?

45:42.652 --> 45:44.654
My work's
at an important stage.

45:44.829 --> 45:47.657
- It didn't seem necessary to--
- To what?

45:47.832 --> 45:50.791
Give me your full attention?

45:50.965 --> 45:52.575
For once?

45:52.750 --> 45:54.795
If there's a problem
with my attitude,

45:54.969 --> 45:56.710
I'm prepared to discuss it.

46:01.976 --> 46:03.151
I hate you.

46:06.328 --> 46:07.373
Laurie?

47:01.731 --> 47:02.732
I left Jon.

47:02.907 --> 47:05.866
Oh, I... I'm sorry, I--

47:06.040 --> 47:10.740
And I'm sorry
to dump this on you,

47:10.915 --> 47:14.179
but you don't know
what it's like,
living with him.

47:17.486 --> 47:19.967
For him...

47:20.141 --> 47:23.492
<i>the real world is like
walking through mist,</i>

47:23.666 --> 47:27.757
and all the people
are just shadows.

47:27.932 --> 47:30.543
<i>I mean, the way
he looks at things,</i>

47:30.717 --> 47:33.154
<i>like he can't remember
what they are,</i>

47:33.328 --> 47:36.679
<i>and he doesn't
particularly care.</i>

47:36.854 --> 47:39.900
Sometimes I look at myself
and I don't understand

47:40.074 --> 47:44.731
how things got so tangled up.

47:53.914 --> 47:56.438
- Hey, can we go out?
- Oh!

47:56.612 --> 47:57.962
- Get some air?
- Um...

47:59.267 --> 48:01.356
I'll get my coat.

48:02.836 --> 48:03.793
<i>Let's go.</i>

48:14.326 --> 48:16.197
- Oh! Dr. Manhattan!
- Dr. Osterman...

48:16.371 --> 48:17.938
We need to get you
into make-up.

48:18.112 --> 48:20.506
That blue is-is
far too light for broadcast.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.074
- Is this dark enough?
- That's perfect!

48:23.248 --> 48:26.729
Here's a list of no-go
talking points compiled
by army intelligence.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.471
Afghanistan will come up
but play it cool...

48:29.645 --> 48:33.649
<i>And try not to get into
any tight corners.</i>

48:36.000 --> 48:39.568
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have something really
special for you tonight.

48:39.742 --> 48:41.527
In his first live interview,

48:41.701 --> 48:44.138
let's have a hand
for Doctor Manhattan himself,

48:44.312 --> 48:48.142
Dr. Jon Osterman!

48:48.316 --> 48:51.145
So, uh... what's up, Doc?

48:51.319 --> 48:53.713
Well, you'll forgive
the levity, doctor,

48:53.887 --> 48:56.455
<i>but the news overseas
has everyone a little tense.</i>

48:56.629 --> 49:02.200
<i>So, before
I throw you to our hungry
reporters here tonight,</i>

49:02.374 --> 49:05.420
<i>let me kick things off
with this...</i>

49:05.594 --> 49:08.336
If the Reds act up
in Afghanistan,

49:08.510 --> 49:11.687
are you prepared
to enter hostilities?

49:11.861 --> 49:15.865
There is no situation
in Afghanistan currently
requiring my attention.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.346
Ahem. If I can jump in.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.566
Doug Roth. <i>Nova Express.</i>

49:20.740 --> 49:24.439
Dr Osterman...
Do you remember Wally Weaver?

49:24.613 --> 49:27.138
<i>The newspapers called him
Dr. Manhattan's buddy.</i>

49:27.312 --> 49:30.315
<i>- He died of cancer in '71...</i>
- <i>I remember.</i>

49:31.838 --> 49:33.535
I attended Wally's funeral

49:33.709 --> 49:37.452
How about Edgar W. Jacobi,
aka Moloch?

49:37.626 --> 49:40.499
<i>You and he battled it out many
times over the years.</i>

49:40.673 --> 49:42.936
<i>Did you know he's
also battling terminal cancer?</i>

49:44.546 --> 49:47.549
No. I did not know that.
I would rather not--

49:47.723 --> 49:49.856
And are you aware
that Janey Slater,

49:50.030 --> 49:52.511
with whom you were
romantically linked
for several years,

49:52.685 --> 49:55.296
is suffering from lung cancer?

50:00.954 --> 50:03.870
No, I... I wasn't told. I--

50:04.044 --> 50:06.003
Or that she has
six months to live?

50:06.177 --> 50:07.700
<i>I recently interviewed
Ms. Slater.</i>

50:07.874 --> 50:09.310
<i>Her story's hitting
the streets right now.</i>

50:11.704 --> 50:13.662
- What are you suggesting?
- Jon,

50:13.836 --> 50:16.883
Doug has reports
of over two dozen
of your former associates

50:17.057 --> 50:18.493
who have been
similarly afflicted--

50:18.667 --> 50:20.104
No, I--

50:20.278 --> 50:22.193
Do you have any response
to these allegations?

50:26.893 --> 50:28.590
- Are we gonna get cancer?
- Is this guy radioactive?

50:29.504 --> 50:30.810
Leave me alone.

50:30.984 --> 50:33.117
Do you think
you gave Ms. Slater cancer

50:33.291 --> 50:34.422
<i>by sleeping with her?</i>

50:37.469 --> 50:39.427
I said--

50:39.601 --> 50:41.777
How does it feel knowing
you may have doomed
hundreds of people?

50:41.951 --> 50:45.303
Leave me alone!

51:17.422 --> 51:18.597
Um...

51:19.772 --> 51:22.514
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

51:22.688 --> 51:24.777
Um... I...

51:24.951 --> 51:27.475
We just need to get
our breath back.

51:27.649 --> 51:30.217
- We should--
- I'm just gonna go
grab a hotel.

51:30.391 --> 51:31.871
Think my relationship over.

51:32.045 --> 51:33.307
Oh. Of course.

51:33.481 --> 51:36.049
Thanks for listening, Dan.
Take care.

51:36.223 --> 51:37.006
Sure...

51:37.181 --> 51:38.704
W-w...

51:40.619 --> 51:42.142
You too, Laurie...

51:43.535 --> 51:44.362
<i>Bye.</i>

51:52.892 --> 51:56.591
<i>The freighter's murderous
onslaught had surprised us.</i>

51:59.638 --> 52:03.729
<i>We'd been blasted to fragments
before we could warn Davidstown
of the hell-ship's approach.</i>

52:05.122 --> 52:07.515
<i>I thought of my family there,</i>

52:07.689 --> 52:11.389
<i>vulnerable, unsuspecting,</i>

52:11.563 --> 52:14.783
<i>unaware of the damnation
that bore down upon them.</i>

52:16.872 --> 52:22.051
<i>Crazed with helplessness,
I cursed God and wept,</i>

52:22.226 --> 52:24.532
<i>wondering if he wept also.</i>

52:24.706 --> 52:28.710
<i>But then, what use
are his tears if he
also denied me help?</i>

52:31.365 --> 52:36.675
<i>That night I slept badly
beneath cold, distant stars</i>

52:36.849 --> 52:39.634
<i>pondering the cold, distant god</i>

52:39.808 --> 52:43.029
<i>in whose hands the fate
of Davidstown rested.</i>

52:45.814 --> 52:47.207
<i>Was he really there?</i>

52:48.513 --> 52:50.297
<i>Had he been there once...</i>

52:51.603 --> 52:53.300
<i>But now departed?</i>

52:53.474 --> 52:57.435
Hey, this base is off limits.
You don't belong... here.

52:59.045 --> 53:00.742
I believe you are correct.

53:02.483 --> 53:05.225
Please tell your superiors
and Laurie Juspeczyk

53:05.399 --> 53:06.618
that I am leaving.

53:07.619 --> 53:08.881
Leaving for Mars.

53:21.154 --> 53:24.244
Gone? What do you mean
he's gone?

53:24.418 --> 53:28.770
Ma'am, your meal ticket
flew the coop after
last night's broadcast.

53:28.944 --> 53:31.904
Dr. Manhattan, the linchpin
of America's security,

53:32.078 --> 53:33.558
has left Earth.

53:33.732 --> 53:35.342
<i>Mr. President...</i>

53:35.516 --> 53:37.344
The Russians are invading
Afghanistan and Pakistan.

53:37.518 --> 53:40.173
If this keeps up,
they'll try taking
Western Europe next.

53:40.347 --> 53:44.090
If Dr. Manhattan
wanted to live on a red planet,

53:44.264 --> 53:46.266
he should've stayed home.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.790
Keep running the numbers
for our losses in a nuclear exchange.

53:48.964 --> 53:52.011
And be ready
for a first strike
in seven days.

53:52.185 --> 53:53.795
Good morning, Daniel.

53:53.969 --> 53:55.449
Brought you your paper.

53:55.623 --> 53:59.105
The Comedian murdered,
Dr. Manhattan exiled...

53:59.279 --> 54:02.413
Two of us gone.
All within a week.

54:02.587 --> 54:07.418
Who next? Veidt?
Juspeczyk? Me? You?

54:07.592 --> 54:10.551
These days, nobody's safe.

54:31.137 --> 54:33.313
<i>The photograph
is in my hand.</i>

54:35.359 --> 54:37.926
<i>It is the photograph of a man
and a woman.</i>

54:39.667 --> 54:42.757
<i>They are at
an amusement park in 1959.</i>

54:44.759 --> 54:46.805
<i>In exactly 38 seconds,</i>

54:46.979 --> 54:50.461
<i>I drop the photograph
to the sand and walk away.</i>

54:50.635 --> 54:54.247
<i>It is already there,
31 seconds into the future.</i>

54:54.421 --> 54:56.293
<i>The photograph is in my hands.</i>

54:56.467 --> 54:58.817
<i>I found it in a derelict bar
27 hours ago.</i>

54:58.991 --> 55:00.471
<i>Twenty-four seconds.</i>

55:00.645 --> 55:02.734
<i>It is still there,
27 hours into the past.</i>

55:02.908 --> 55:04.170
<i>Twenty-one seconds.</i>

55:04.344 --> 55:05.737
<i>I am still there,
looking at it.</i>

55:05.911 --> 55:06.738
<i>Eighteen seconds.</i>

55:06.912 --> 55:08.957
<i>It is October, 1985.</i>

55:09.131 --> 55:10.655
<i>- I'm on Mars.
- Fourteen seconds.</i>

55:10.829 --> 55:13.701
<i>- It is July, 1959.
- Eleven seconds.</i>

55:13.875 --> 55:15.964
<i>I am at the
Palisades Amusement Park.</i>

55:16.138 --> 55:19.228
<i>- Eight. Seven. Six.
- I am tired of looking
at the photograph.</i>

55:19.403 --> 55:22.014
<i>- Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
- I open my fingers.</i>

55:22.188 --> 55:23.624
<i>It falls to the sand.</i>

55:27.236 --> 55:30.283
<i>I am going to look
at the stars.</i>

55:30.457 --> 55:33.068
<i>They are so far away,</i>

55:33.242 --> 55:37.334
<i>and their light takes
so long to reach us.</i>

55:37.508 --> 55:41.729
<i>All we ever see of the stars
are their old photographs.</i>

55:51.086 --> 55:52.914
<i>I am watching the stars,</i>

55:53.088 --> 55:56.353
<i>admiring their complex trajectories</i>

55:56.527 --> 55:57.832
<i>through space,</i>

55:58.833 --> 56:01.575
<i>through time.</i>

56:01.749 --> 56:05.666
<i>My father admired the sky
for its precision.</i>

56:05.840 --> 56:07.233
<i>He repaired watches.</i>

56:09.540 --> 56:11.716
<i>It is August, 1945.</i>

56:11.890 --> 56:13.674
<i>I sit in a Brooklyn kitchen,</i>

56:13.848 --> 56:17.025
<i>fascinated by an arrangement
of cogs on black velvet.</i>

56:17.199 --> 56:18.592
<i>I am 16 years old.</i>

56:18.766 --> 56:20.768
Jon? Jon? What are you doing?

56:20.942 --> 56:22.509
Practicing on your
old pocket-watch
before I leave for school--

56:22.683 --> 56:25.294
Forget watches.
Have you seen the news?

56:25.469 --> 56:29.821
They dropped an atomic bomb
on Japan! A whole city, gone!

56:29.995 --> 56:32.389
- This changes everything!
- Father, what are you--

56:32.563 --> 56:34.739
- I'm doing what
is best for you.
- Wait!

56:34.913 --> 56:37.872
This atomic science
is what the world will need,

56:38.046 --> 56:40.875
not pocket watches!

56:41.049 --> 56:46.925
Professor Einstein says
that time differs
from place to place.

56:47.099 --> 56:52.583
If time is not true,
what purpose have watchmakers?

56:52.757 --> 56:55.499
Wait! No!

56:55.673 --> 56:59.459
<i>Forty years ago,
cogs rain on Brooklyn.</i>

56:59.633 --> 57:02.462
<i>One hundred and fifteen minutes
into the future,</i>

57:02.636 --> 57:05.900
<i>meteorites penetrate
the rarefied Martian atmosphere.</i>

57:08.773 --> 57:10.775
<i>It is 1958.</i>

57:10.949 --> 57:13.995
<i>I am graduating
with a PhD in atomic physics.</i>

57:15.693 --> 57:19.044
<i>It is May 12th, 1959,</i>

57:19.218 --> 57:22.961
<i>my first day
at the Gila Flats Test Base.</i>

57:23.135 --> 57:25.093
<i>Wally Weaver shows me around.</i>

57:26.834 --> 57:28.880
What's this place?

57:29.054 --> 57:30.490
This is where the intrinsic
field experiments happen.

57:30.664 --> 57:33.406
They're, uh, trying to prove
there's some field

57:33.580 --> 57:36.061
holdin' stuff together
besides gravity.

57:36.235 --> 57:38.411
This is our time-lock
test vault,

57:38.585 --> 57:41.240
for when they're tryin'
to separate objects
from their intrinsic fields.

57:41.414 --> 57:43.895
It makes sure
no radiation gets out.

57:50.989 --> 57:54.166
<i>Wally steers me
to a crowded bar.</i>

57:54.340 --> 57:57.430
<i>There is a sudden
sense of deja vu.</i>

58:00.477 --> 58:03.305
So, you must be the new guy.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.525
Pretty young
for a research scientist.

58:05.699 --> 58:08.485
Well, my dad sort of
pushed me into it.

58:09.529 --> 58:11.009
Happens to me a lot.

58:11.183 --> 58:13.446
Other people seem to make
all my moves for me.

58:13.620 --> 58:16.884
I'm Janey Slater.

58:17.058 --> 58:19.060
Can I buy you a drink?

58:19.234 --> 58:20.148
<i>Hey, young lovers!</i>

58:21.715 --> 58:23.500
There!
That's a beautiful picture!

58:23.674 --> 58:24.501
<i>The photograph lies
in the sand.</i>

58:24.675 --> 58:26.720
<i>It is July, 1959.</i>

58:26.894 --> 58:29.375
<i>By the shooting gallery,
Janey's watch falls off</i>

58:29.549 --> 58:32.247
<i>and a man steps on it.</i>

58:32.421 --> 58:34.380
<i>- I tell her I can fix it.</i>
- I can fix it.

58:36.164 --> 58:38.123
<i>It is 1963.</i>

58:38.297 --> 58:40.821
<i>We're making love
after an argument,</i>

58:40.995 --> 58:45.304
<i>our tenderness
in direct proportion
to its violence.</i>

58:45.478 --> 58:49.917
<i>It is 1966, and she's
packing a suitcase, crying.</i>

58:53.442 --> 58:55.749
<i>It is August, 1959.</i>

58:55.923 --> 58:57.969
<i>We have only been together
for a month.</i>

58:58.143 --> 59:01.450
- So Jon...
<i>- The accident
is waiting for me.</i>

59:01.625 --> 59:03.409
...did you fix my watch yet?

59:03.583 --> 59:07.021
Sure did, it's right-- Oh.

59:09.328 --> 59:11.025
Must've left it in my lab coat

59:11.199 --> 59:13.593
when we were resetting
the intrinsic chamber.

59:13.767 --> 59:14.594
Be right back.

59:17.118 --> 59:19.730
<i>The accident is almost
upon me now.</i>

59:47.714 --> 59:49.847
- Janey! Janey!
- Jon?

59:50.021 --> 59:51.892
- Open the door!
- I can't!

59:52.066 --> 59:53.546
Open the door!

59:53.720 --> 59:55.896
It's on a timelock
for the next experiment! I--

59:56.070 --> 59:57.768
- I can't override it!
- No.

59:59.204 --> 01:00:01.293
Oh, God, it's starting!

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.818
Oh my God! Janey!

01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:06.820
- It's my fault!
- No!

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:08.126
No! Janey!

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.736
- Please!
- I can't stay and watch...

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.869
Please, I... I just can't.

01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:13.827
- Don't go!
- I'm sorry.

01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.786
No! No! No! No! No! No!

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.830
Janey!

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:22.314
No...

01:00:22.488 --> 01:00:24.751
<i>The shields slide back
from the particle cannons.</i>

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:28.059
<i>The atoms in the test chamber
begin screaming.</i>

01:00:28.233 --> 01:00:30.757
<i>I look at the watch in my hand.</i>

01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:32.585
<i>Good as new.</i>

01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.369
<i>And the light...</i>

01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:36.894
<i>the light is taking me
to pieces.</i>

01:00:47.513 --> 01:00:49.210
<i>It is September.</i>

01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:52.126
<i>A token funeral service
is held.</i>

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.954
<i>There is nothing to bury.</i>

01:00:56.522 --> 01:00:58.524
<i>It is October.</i>

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:01.919
<i>Janey places the only photo
anyone has of me in the bar.</i>

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.750
<i>It is November.</i>

01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:11.668
<i>A human nervous system
briefly materializes.</i>

01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:15.672
<i>It is November 10th now.</i>

01:01:15.846 --> 01:01:18.936
<i>A circulatory system is seen
walking through the kitchen.</i>

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.241
Wha... What?

01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:22.766
<i>November 14th.</i>

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:26.247
<i>A partially muscled
skeleton appears outside
the perimeter fence.</i>

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:29.511
<i>It screams for 30 seconds
before vanishing.</i>

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:32.689
<i>Really, it is just a question</i>

01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:35.996
<i>of reassembling the components
in the correct sequence.</i>

01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:02.066
Jon?

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:05.112
Jon?

01:02:05.286 --> 01:02:07.724
<i>It is Christmas, 1959.</i>

01:02:07.898 --> 01:02:11.205
So, do you like it?

01:02:11.379 --> 01:02:15.470
I mean, is a ring the sort
of thing that you like

01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:17.908
now that you're, uh...

01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:20.301
<i>Like that symbol
on your helmet?</i>

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:22.434
Marketing boys say
you need a symbol.

01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:24.784
<i>It's February, 1960.</i>

01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:27.265
Your symbol is meaningless.

01:02:27.439 --> 01:02:28.788
If I am to have a symbol,

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:31.748
a hydrogen atom
would be more appropriate.

01:02:31.922 --> 01:02:34.359
A symbol I respect.

01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:37.405
It's atomic structure
is a perfect grid.

01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:39.016
I like it very much.

01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:42.715
Janey? What's wrong?

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:45.326
I'm scared, Jon.

01:02:46.023 --> 01:02:48.112
Of me?

01:02:48.286 --> 01:02:50.592
<i>They assign me the name
Dr. Manhattan</i>

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:55.641
<i>for the ominous
associations it will raise
in American enemies.</i>

01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:59.210
<i>They're shaping me into
something gaudy and lethal.</i>

01:02:59.384 --> 01:03:04.737
I'm just scared because
everything feels... weird.

01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:06.608
<i>March, 1960.</i>

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.176
<i>We repeat: the superman exists</i>

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.787
<i>and he's American.</i>

01:03:10.961 --> 01:03:12.658
<i>Pentagon sources say</i>

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:15.574
<i>this Dr. Manhattan can control
atomic structure itself.</i>

01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:18.577
<i>There's been
no response from the Kremlin.</i>

01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:21.710
It's as if
everything's changed

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:23.887
<i>November, 1960.</i>

01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:26.498
<i>The newspapers
call me a crime-fighter,</i>

01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:30.589
<i>so the Pentagon says
I must fight crime.</i>

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:34.114
<i>The morality of my activities
escapes me.</i>

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:37.814
Not just you. Everything.

01:03:37.988 --> 01:03:40.120
<i>May, 1962.</i>

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:44.211
<i>A masked man retires to open
an auto-repair business.</i>

01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:46.953
With someone like you around,
the whole situation changes.

01:03:47.127 --> 01:03:48.607
You can do anything.

01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:51.131
All I got to offer
is a good left hook.

01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:53.873
And some mean wrenching skills
under the hood.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:57.485
Well, the new electric
cars I've designed
should be simpler.

01:03:58.138 --> 01:03:59.096
Electric?

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:03.187
They say you can do
anything, Jon.

01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:05.537
They say you're like a...

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.104
like a god now.

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:09.323
<i>September, 1961.</i>

01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:11.325
<i>John Kennedy is
asking what it's like
to be a superhero.</i>

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:12.370
So, what's it like
to be a superhero?

01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:13.545
You should know.

01:04:13.719 --> 01:04:15.329
<i>I tell him he should know.</i>

01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:16.287
<i>He nods, laughing.</i>

01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:20.813
I don't think
there is a god, Janey.

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:24.164
If there is, I'm not him.

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:26.427
<i>November, 1963.</i>

01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:30.431
<i>In Dallas, his head
snaps forward and then
back. Two shots.</i>

01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.782
I can't believe this.
So you knew he'd get shot?

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.567
Then why didn't you
do something?

01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:37.786
I cannot prevent the future.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:40.833
To me, it is already happening.

01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:43.140
I'm still the same person.

01:04:43.314 --> 01:04:44.750
Nothing's changed.

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:48.319
<i>It is 1966.</i>

01:04:48.493 --> 01:04:50.495
<i>A young woman sits to my right.</i>

01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:53.672
<i>She looks at me and smiles.</i>

01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:57.328
Stop staring at that girl!
Pay attention!

01:04:57.502 --> 01:05:01.114
I'll always want you.

01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:04.770
<i>As I lie, I hear
her sobbing in 1966.</i>

01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:10.950
<i>It is May, 1966.</i>

01:05:11.124 --> 01:05:13.126
My name's Laurie.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.825
Do you have another name,
apart from Dr. Manhattan.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.871
You pig.

01:05:20.612 --> 01:05:21.830
My name's Jon.

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.572
I knew
you were seeing her!

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:30.056
It's nice of you to come out
on patrol with me.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:33.712
Your um, girlfriend
won't mind, will she?

01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:35.844
<i>As I lie...</i>

01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:38.978
- I hate you.
<i>- ...I see her walking
out on me in 1985.</i>

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.416
<i>She is beautiful.</i>

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:46.507
<i>After each kiss,
she plants a smaller,
gentler one on my face,</i>

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:48.683
<i>like a signature.</i>

01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:52.122
<i>I pull her closer,
never wanting to lose her.</i>

01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:53.514
<i>Knowing that I shall.</i>

01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:03.829
<i>I am tired of their world...</i>

01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:09.617
<i>of these people.</i>

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.055
Alone!

01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:15.493
<i>I am tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.</i>

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.411
<i>In Arizona,
I am taking the photo...</i>

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:22.761
<i>and I am gone.</i>

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:27.548
<i>Gone to Mars.</i>

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:35.513
<i>And I have decided
to create something.</i>

01:06:42.737 --> 01:06:45.479
<i>A world grows up around me.</i>

01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:49.483
<i>Am I shaping it,</i>

01:06:49.657 --> 01:06:52.530
<i>or do its predetermined
contours guide my hand?</i>

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:56.882
<i>The world changed
because of me.</i>

01:06:57.056 --> 01:07:00.973
<i>But what if I hadn't left
the watch in the test chamber?</i>

01:07:01.147 --> 01:07:03.628
<i>What if I had not gone back?</i>

01:07:03.802 --> 01:07:06.544
<i>Or waited, just a moment?</i>

01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:09.677
<i>Am I to blame, then?</i>

01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:10.896
<i>Or Janey?</i>

01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:13.290
<i>Or my father?</i>

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.293
<i>Which of us is responsible?</i>

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.386
<i>Who makes the world?</i>

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.649
<i>Perhaps the world is not made.</i>

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.478
<i>Perhaps nothing is made.</i>

01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:31.308
<i>Perhaps it simply is,</i>

01:07:31.482 --> 01:07:35.529
<i>has been,
and will always be there.</i>

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.967
<i>A clock without a craftsman.</i>

01:07:40.578 --> 01:07:42.362
<i>I am standing on a balcony,</i>

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:44.538
<i>as I once stood
on a fire escape,</i>

01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:48.281
<i>trying to catch the falling
cogs and wheels.</i>

01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:50.240
<i>But it is too late.</i>

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:51.806
<i>Always has been.</i>

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:55.027
<i>Always will be.</i>

01:07:56.985 --> 01:07:58.944
<i>Above the
Nodous Gordii mountains,</i>

01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:02.730
<i>like jewels
in a maker-less mechanism,</i>

01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:05.559
<i>the first meteorites
begin to fall.</i>

01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:22.881
Oh, God,
not again.

01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:27.103
What do you want from me?

01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:28.974
Nothing.
Old and alone.

01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:30.541
Thought you might
appreciate company.

01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:32.151
Can I come out, then?

01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:33.848
No.

01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.850
Deep breath.

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:38.679
You said Comedian visited here.
Mentioned a list.

01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:40.464
You and Janey Slater
were on it.

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.640
Talked about someone
messing with Dr. Manhattan.

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:45.164
Days later, Manhattan
publicly disgraced.

01:08:45.338 --> 01:08:46.687
Forced into exile.

01:08:46.861 --> 01:08:49.125
Allegations he'd
given people cancer.

01:08:49.299 --> 01:08:51.214
Janey Slater. You.

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.913
Tough break.

01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:57.133
I think Blake's list
was cancer list.

01:08:57.307 --> 01:08:59.135
Somebody wrote it.
Somebody put your name on it.

01:08:59.309 --> 01:09:01.049
Somebody gave it to the media.

01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:03.487
Comedian and Dr. Manhattan were
always your biggest enemies.

01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:04.792
Now they're both gone.

01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:06.968
Very convenient.
Who is it, Moloch?

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.927
- Who's behind this?
- I don't know!

01:09:09.101 --> 01:09:11.234
- Not convincing.
- I don't know!

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.018
I don't know!

01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:16.064
I swear to God,
I don't know who it was!

01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:18.241
Hmm. Better.

01:09:20.852 --> 01:09:22.636
If anything should
refresh memory,

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:24.551
contact me by leaving note,

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:27.772
trash can opposite Gunga Diner,
at 40th and 7th.

01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:37.085
<i>Rorschach's journal.
October 21st, 1985. 2:35 AM.</i>

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.523
<i>Jacobi visit useless.
Knows nothing.</i>

01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:42.439
<i>Has simply been used.
But by who?</i>

01:09:42.613 --> 01:09:43.657
<i>Russians?</i>

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.355
<i>Comedian mentioned an island,</i>

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.792
<i>artists and writers
living on it.</i>

01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:49.446
<i>Doesn't fit.</i>

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.057
<i>Waiting for a flash
of enlightenment</i>

01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.190
<i>in all this blood and thunder.</i>

01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:03.590
<i>Everything I loved,</i>

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:06.289
<i>everything I lived for,</i>

01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:11.642
<i>depended on my reaching
Davidstown in advance
of that terrible freighter.</i>

01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:14.514
<i>It was then I conceived
of building a raft.</i>

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:19.171
<i>But the island's trees
did not look buoyant enough
to reach Davidstown,</i>

01:10:19.345 --> 01:10:21.478
<i>not unaided.</i>

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:26.613
<i>Suddenly, I found myself considering
a repulsive notion...</i>

01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:31.705
<i>Birthed from the gas-bloated
stomachs of the buried men.</i>

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:35.622
<i>I shuddered
at my loathsome scheme.</i>

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:38.930
<i>But I had no choice.</i>

01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:41.237
<i>I pulled men up
from underground,</i>

01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:43.630
<i>sand trickling
from their sockets.</i>

01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:47.155
<i>I tore their clothes to ribbons
to bind them together.</i>

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:50.594
<i>I fixed their bodies
to the bottom of the raft.</i>

01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:52.378
<i>As the ebb tide rose,</i>

01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:56.556
<i>I embarked, heading east.</i>

01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.864
<i>East, across the night seas.</i>

01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:03.650
<i>Borne on the naked backs
of murdered men.</i>

01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:06.697
<i>Lent speed by my hunger,</i>

01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:08.655
<i>I ripped a seagull
from the air.</i>

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.791
<i>I had not eaten
since the shipwreck.</i>

01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:19.187
<i>Chewing on raw meat,
I drifted on toward Davidstown.</i>

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:21.059
<i>My home was there.</i>

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.931
<i>And nothing would
take it from me.</i>

01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:26.238
So...
the government said

01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:28.327
I can't live on the base
now that Jon's gone.

01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:31.069
And they canceled
my credit cards.

01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:33.419
Now all I have left
is my savings.

01:11:33.593 --> 01:11:35.900
What-- Where...
where will you stay?

01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:37.205
Did you call your mother?

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.338
I'd rather sleep
on a street grate.

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.775
It just burns my ass
to be so damn...

01:11:43.211 --> 01:11:44.300
disposable.

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.868
- Well, I um--
- Anyway,

01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:51.394
I appreciate you
buying me lunch, Dan.

01:11:51.568 --> 01:11:53.526
Don't worry about me,

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.267
I'll find someplace cheap
to stay.

01:11:59.053 --> 01:12:00.620
- Laurie!
- Yeah?

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.231
You could, uh, always
stay at my place.

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:04.842
There's plenty of room.

01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:06.626
Oh, I-I don't want to impose.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.585
Hey... you're not.

01:12:09.237 --> 01:12:10.151
Truly.

01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:13.590
I mean, we're both friends.

01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:15.331
We're both in
the same line of work.

01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:17.071
And we're both, uh...

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:19.073
We're both leftovers.

01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:23.817
Yeah.

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:26.690
<i>I'd swallowed too much
bird flesh,</i>

01:12:26.864 --> 01:12:29.649
<i>too much horror.</i>

01:12:29.823 --> 01:12:33.087
<i>I grew faint
and dozed fitfully.</i>

01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:38.310
<i>The Black Freighter's
hideous banner flapped
dismally in my dreams.</i>

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:42.619
<i>Its death's-head banner
flies above us all.</i>

01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:49.016
<i>And the heads nailed
to the ship's black prow
are our heads.</i>

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:54.587
<i>Truly, whoever we are,
wherever we reside,</i>

01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:58.025
<i>we exist on the whim
of murderers.</i>

01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:01.725
Your four o'clock
is here, Mr. Veidt.

01:13:01.899 --> 01:13:04.902
<i>Beneath my raft,
something moved.</i>

01:13:05.076 --> 01:13:07.034
It's the meeting
with the toy company, isn't it?

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:10.473
Yes. They want some
new characters in
their Ozymandias line.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:13.214
They said maybe
some of your major villains.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.653
The major villains
are all dead.

01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:20.918
<i>Irrationally, my first thought
was of the corpses,</i>

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:22.833
<i>bursting their bonds,</i>

01:13:23.007 --> 01:13:26.140
<i>attempting to clamber up
into the air and dryness.</i>

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:32.756
Did you see the news?

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.932
Some guy went crazy
and killed his kid

01:13:35.106 --> 01:13:38.022
because he was afraid
there's gonna be a nuclear war.

01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:40.720
I'm sorry,
but that's just dumb.

01:13:40.894 --> 01:13:43.375
Nobody's so crazy
that they'll start a war.

01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:47.379
I don't understand why
everyone's so down and scared.

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:50.426
Well, perhaps they lack
your youth and enthusiasm.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.950
Well, I have to be upbeat
to work in this place.

01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:55.343
All this Egyptian decor
is very morbid.

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.998
<i>In the darkening water
I heard a splash.</i>

01:13:58.172 --> 01:13:59.783
Very obsessed
with death.

01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:02.655
<i>Shadowy forms approached.</i>

01:14:02.829 --> 01:14:05.832
<i>Were they boats
come to rescue me?</i>

01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:09.314
Actually death wasn't morbid
to the ancient Egyptians.

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:11.577
They saw death
as an inevitable step

01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:14.711
in beginning a voyage
of spiritual discovery.

01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:16.190
I find that very comforting.

01:14:16.364 --> 01:14:19.237
<i>No, not boats.</i>

01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:20.760
<i>Fins.</i>

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:22.936
Well, I think it's--
Oh, God, he's got a gun!

01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:29.160
<i>Teeth shredded my raft.</i>

01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:32.206
<i>Tiny, prehistoric eyes
glistened with rage.</i>

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.950
<i>It became tangled in my ropes.</i>

01:14:37.124 --> 01:14:40.345
<i>Terrified, I took up
a splinter of mast.</i>

01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:43.391
<i>The shark's stained marble eye
looked up at me...</i>

01:14:43.566 --> 01:14:45.263
<i>And in that instant...</i>

01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:47.178
<i>We knew each other!</i>

01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:48.875
What have you got
in your mouth? No!

01:14:49.049 --> 01:14:52.183
Don't bite down.
Don't bite down, you scum!

01:14:52.357 --> 01:14:54.185
<i>The leviathan
attempted to swim away...</i>

01:14:54.359 --> 01:14:56.753
<i>Dragging my raft
in its bloody wake.</i>

01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:58.406
I want to know
who's behind this!

01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.583
<i>I hung on desperately,</i>

01:15:00.757 --> 01:15:03.673
<i>cursing in the bitter
stinging spray.</i>

01:15:06.153 --> 01:15:08.808
Damn... cyanide capsule.

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:20.516
<i>Eventually the shark died.</i>

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:24.520
<i>And shortly thereafter,
stopped swimming.</i>

01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:31.352
Good evening, Jacobi.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.094
Was wondering why
you wanted to see me.

01:15:34.268 --> 01:15:36.532
Then someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man.

01:15:36.706 --> 01:15:39.535
Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias...

01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:41.188
someone's killing
masks, Jacobi.

01:15:41.362 --> 01:15:42.929
Someone wants us dead.

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:44.365
Maybe you can enlighten me.

01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:46.716
Hmm...

01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:52.809
<i>Rorschach!</i>

01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:54.071
- No.
<i>- This is the police!</i>

01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:56.073
No, no, no, no!

01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:58.597
<i>We know you're in there,
it's all over!</i>

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:00.860
<i>If there's anyone
in there with you,</i>

01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.688
<i>- send them out unharmed!</i>
- Framed. Set-up.

01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:04.864
Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:06.605
<i>Then come out
and surrender with your
hands clearly visible.</i>

01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:09.347
Never. Never surrender.
Need weapons.

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:11.131
<i>You have 30 seconds!</i>

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:15.788
<i>There's no escape Rorschach.</i>

01:16:15.962 --> 01:16:17.747
<i>- It's the end of the line.</i>
- Yes.

01:16:19.052 --> 01:16:20.358
<i>Time's up!</i>

01:16:20.532 --> 01:16:22.012
Ready when you are.

01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:09.537
Get up, get up!

01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:11.104
- No pain, no--
- Get him!
Don't let him get away!

01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:12.236
- It was a setup.
- Cuff him!

01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:13.846
Somebody framed me, somebody--

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.370
No! No! No! My face!

01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:17.807
Give me back my face!

01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:19.373
Give me back my face!

01:17:19.547 --> 01:17:21.941
Give me back my face!

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:32.865
<i>After eating their fill,
the sharks departed.</i>

01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:40.220
<i>For the moment, I was safe.</i>

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:46.357
<i>That night, eating shark,</i>

01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:50.970
<i>I would have chuckled
at the inversions
of natural roles</i>

01:17:51.144 --> 01:17:55.540
<i>had not my parched laughter
seemed so hateful.</i>

01:17:58.412 --> 01:18:03.026
<i>My raft grew
increasingly grotesque,</i>

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.812
<i>reflecting my own
gradual transformation.</i>

01:18:08.379 --> 01:18:11.556
<i>With such thoughts
to comfort me,</i>

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:15.952
<i>I drifted on,
mast-less into the dawn.</i>

01:18:32.316 --> 01:18:36.668
<i>Hey kids,
tune in for the animated
adventures of Ozymandias.</i>

01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:40.063
<i>This Saturday morning
sponsored by Meltdown!</i>

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.632
<i>In the May
of this year, 1962,</i>

01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:47.244
<i>that's exactly what
I opted to do.</i>

01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:48.593
<i>I retired.</i>

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:50.160
<i>To mend cars.</i>

01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:52.640
<i>Probably for the rest
of my life.</i>

01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:54.730
<i>As I see it,
part of the art of being a hero</i>

01:18:54.904 --> 01:18:57.515
<i>is knowing when you don't
need to be one anymore,</i>

01:18:57.689 --> 01:18:59.778
<i>realizing that the game
has changed,</i>

01:18:59.952 --> 01:19:01.780
<i>and that the stakes
are different,</i>

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.782
<i>and that there isn't
necessarily a place for you</i>

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:07.177
<i>in this strange new pantheon
of extraordinary people.</i>

01:19:07.351 --> 01:19:08.961
<i>The world has moved on,</i>

01:19:09.135 --> 01:19:11.137
<i>and I'm content to watch it
from my armchair</i>

01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:12.965
<i>with a beer by my side</i>

01:19:13.139 --> 01:19:15.925
<i>and the smell of fresh oil
still on my fingers.</i>

01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:17.796
<i>Part of my contentment
comes from knowing</i>

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:20.538
<i>that there have maybe been
some overall consequence</i>

01:19:20.712 --> 01:19:23.367
<i>of my 23 years behind the mask.</i>

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:25.412
<i>This knowledge came to me
in the shape of a letter</i>

01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:29.199
<i>from a young man whose name
I'm not at liberty to reveal.</i>

01:19:29.373 --> 01:19:32.768
<i>He told me of his great
admiration for my efforts
as Nite Owl</i>

01:19:32.942 --> 01:19:34.813
<i>and proposed that,</i>

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:37.076
<i>since I'd retired and would
no longer be using the name,</i>

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.730
<i>perhaps he could borrow it,</i>

01:19:38.904 --> 01:19:40.906
<i>since he intended
to follow my example</i>

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.213
<i>and become a crime-fighter.</i>

01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:45.389
<i>I've visited his home
since then</i>

01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:47.608
<i>and seen some
of the fabulous technology</i>

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.481
<i>he intends to bring to bear
on the war against crime.</i>

01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:52.352
<i>I was certainly
far too impressed</i>

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:54.877
<i>to refuse him the use
of what I'd always thought</i>

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:57.053
<i>was a dumb name to begin with.</i>

01:19:57.227 --> 01:19:59.446
<i>So by the time this sees print,</i>

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.231
<i>there may well be
a new Nite Owl</i>

01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:03.842
<i>patrolling the streets
of New York.</i>

01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:05.583
<i>Also, Sally Jupiter tells me</i>

01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:07.454
<i>that as soon as
little Laurie's old enough</i>

01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:10.806
<i>she wants to be a superheroine
just like her mom.</i>

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.895
<i>So who knows? It seems as if,</i>

01:20:13.069 --> 01:20:14.722
<i>from being a novelty
nine-day wonder,</i>

01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:18.030
<i>the superhero has become
a part of American life.</i>

01:20:18.204 --> 01:20:19.989
<i>It's here to stay.</i>

01:20:20.163 --> 01:20:21.860
<i>For better, or for worse.</i>

01:20:24.341 --> 01:20:28.301
<i>Oh, how the ghost of you
clings... Nostalgia...</i>

01:20:30.086 --> 01:20:32.740
<i>We argued.</i>

01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.917
<i>And I said, Jon,</i>

01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:37.310
<i>you know how every
damn thing in this world</i>

01:20:37.484 --> 01:20:39.443
<i>fits together except people.</i>

01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.532
<i>It's okay, Ms. Slater.</i>

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:44.100
<i>We can stop here
if you need to.</i>

01:20:44.274 --> 01:20:47.103
<i>No. No, I want
the world to know
all the details.</i>

01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:49.279
<i>I'm glad you contacted me.</i>

01:20:49.453 --> 01:20:52.412
<i>It's a relief to finally
tell the truth about him.</i>

01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:56.503
<i>Well, after helping
Nova Express with
our investigations,</i>

01:20:56.677 --> 01:20:58.854
<i>and sharing your story
with the world,</i>

01:20:59.028 --> 01:21:00.290
<i>how do you feel?</i>

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:02.727
<i>Heh, bitter as hell.</i>

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:05.251
<i>Oh, and I don't need
anyone's sympathy.</i>

01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:07.950
<i>That won't cure my cancer.</i>

01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:10.126
<i>After learning
of your condition,</i>

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.520
<i>and the others, Dr. Osterman
teleported to Mars,</i>

01:21:13.694 --> 01:21:16.393
<i>sending shockwaves
across the globe.</i>

01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:18.482
<i>Any comment about that?</i>

01:21:18.656 --> 01:21:20.832
<i>It figures.</i>

01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:23.139
<i>He dumped me
for some 16-year-old</i>

01:21:23.313 --> 01:21:24.923
<i>who ran around
in her underwear.</i>

01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:27.491
<i>Now everyone's shocked
that he dumped Earth for Mars?</i>

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:31.060
<i>Ah, they're all just worried</i>

01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:33.453
<i>because he's not here
to stop us from nuking
each other.</i>

01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:37.109
<i>Worried they're all
going to die in a
radioactive wasteland.</i>

01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:44.682
<i>Well, Mr. Roth,
here's your comment...</i>

01:21:44.856 --> 01:21:46.684
<i>welcome to my world.</i>

01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:56.824
<i>So, seen the news lately?</i>

01:21:56.999 --> 01:21:59.784
<i>Can't miss
the headlines about this war
they say is coming.</i>

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.047
There was a smaller story yesterday...

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:03.919
about a tenement fire?

01:22:06.834 --> 01:22:08.575
<i>If I can figure out
who made the rescue,</i>

01:22:10.403 --> 01:22:11.535
so can the police.

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:17.062
You're not taking Rorschach's
maskkiller nonsense seriously?

01:22:17.236 --> 01:22:19.325
<i>We worked together.</i>

01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:21.371
<i>Rorschach was always
a brilliant investigator
and tactician,</i>

01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:24.765
so I wonder if he found
any evidence that links
all these events.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:29.683
<i>The four of us, taken down.</i>

01:22:29.857 --> 01:22:32.251
<i>War looming on the horizon.</i>

01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:34.601
<i>I'm terrified it's all connected</i>

01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:36.168
<i>and the worst is yet to come,</i>

01:22:36.342 --> 01:22:39.824
<i>and I can't do anything
to stop it.</i>

01:22:39.998 --> 01:22:41.521
No!

01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:44.394
Rorschach again...
They finally caught him.

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:46.178
<i>There's a riot at the prison.</i>

01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:50.661
We got a jail full of guys
out here who hates your guts!

01:22:50.835 --> 01:22:51.705
What do you got?

01:22:52.532 --> 01:22:53.664
Your arms.

01:22:55.622 --> 01:22:58.190
Come and get me.

01:22:58.364 --> 01:22:59.800
<i>If we don't crack
this case,</i>

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.889
<i>there may be no going back
for any of us.</i>

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:05.806
<i>Everybody's scared.</i>

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.460
<i>You can feel it.</i>

01:23:07.634 --> 01:23:09.245
<i>We'll get murdered
in the chaos.</i>

01:23:09.419 --> 01:23:12.161
Just waitin' for the nukes
to start droppin'.

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:15.164
You are going to try
to convince me
to save this world.

01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:18.515
<i>Humanity might be
on the brink of extinction.</i>

01:23:18.689 --> 01:23:20.517
Doesn't that bother you?

01:23:20.691 --> 01:23:24.390
This face is all I need.

01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:26.349
<i>Never compromise.</i>

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:28.960
Do it!!

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:33.617
<i>This all says war.</i>

01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:35.445
<i>I will invest accordingly.</i>
