00:05.760 --> 00:07.400

00:07.480 --> 00:08.880
Perhaps they were looking for us.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
Emily, what are you doing?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.600
Come with me right now,
or you're gonna die.

-Hey, are you guys okay?

00:23.040 --> 00:24.560
You've be looking after all of them.

-MAN: I have no idea.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.400
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-My sight's come back.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.680
It's not like my sight was before.
It's different.

00:46.880 --> 00:47.880
So where are you going?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.840
I'm trying to find a way
to kill these things.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.600
How the hell do they know
so much about us?

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320

01:12.800 --> 01:15.360

why this is happening to me.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.600

We've heard they’ve found them
in lakes and canals.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.080
It's so weird. They look just like us.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.040
They are us. They're human.
Just don't ask me how it's possible.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
What's wrong with them?

07:07.640 --> 07:11.000
They have, uh, unique mutations
in their DNA.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.160
It seems to affect all of them.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.080
It's like they're siblings.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.960
Maybe the ones we've found
are from the same family.

07:20.160 --> 07:25.920

is a weakness. We can exploit them.

he would be really proud of you too.

simultaneously attack ships

08:25.320 --> 08:27.360

08:28.000 --> 08:30.320
Our target is at the docks in Limehouse.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.680
They've attacked us continually
for months.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.120
Two weeks ago, they stopped.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.400
We’re not sure why.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.520
Given everything we’ve learnt
about them,

08:40.600 --> 08:41.960
this could be our last chance.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.600
You’ve all lost people.
It’s time for some payback.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.840
Bill's going to brief you on what you
can expect to find on board the ship.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.000
Well, uh, I've been...

08:55.680 --> 08:57.280
I’ve been conducting autopsies

08:57.360 --> 09:00.040
on the bodies
that we’ve taken from the river.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.440
And what we found is that
they suffer

09:04.520 --> 09:09.560
from crippling genetic mutations
that result in multiple organ failure.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.320
That’s why they're so reliant
on the creatures.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.680
Because without them, they're helpless.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.440
And given the extent
of their physical degeneration,

09:20.520 --> 09:23.680
we think that you...
You'll encounter minimal resistance.

09:25.240 --> 09:29.000
They’ve also been taking
human babies and foetuses.

09:29.800 --> 09:35.080
And the theory is that
they are using embryonic stem cells...

09:36.960 --> 09:39.040
...to grow new organs.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.920
We think that...

trying to cure themselves.

Everyone's looking at me.
I don't know what to say to them.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.240
BILL: What are we gonna do?

32:17.440 --> 32:20.320
Zoe, what are we going to do?

32:20.400 --> 32:22.200
Well, the transmitter
won't protect us any more.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.800
-They'll be coming for us.
-(SIGHS) Jesus!

32:24.880 --> 32:28.760
-So... So we should go.
-And go where?

32:29.840 --> 32:32.160
They'll find us and kill us.
They always do.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.560
-So we should stay?
-(LAUGHS) I don't know.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.080
Well, we’ve got to do something.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.720
The only reason I’m in charge
is because everyone else is dead.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.760
Those people out there
are depending on you.

32:42.040 --> 32:45.480
So stop feeling sorry for yourself
and come up with a plan.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.640
(VOICE SHAKING) I didn't ask for this.

32:48.720 --> 32:51.160
None of us asked for it. But we’re here.

(SNIFFLES)

33:11.560 --> 33:16.080
Well, we can't move the wounded,
so I guess we’ll just stay.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.240
Okay.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.880
The girl they found on the ship.
You know her?

33:32.080 --> 33:33.080
Emily.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.680
-Why did they keep her alive?
-I don't know.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.720
She used to be blind.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.960
But after the attack,
she got her sight back.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.880
I think she’s connected
to their Quantum Web.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.320
How can she do that?

33:55.480 --> 33:57.320
I don’t know.
Your guess is as good as mine.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.240
You know, she has
the same tattoo as they do.

34:06.720 --> 34:07.960
She got it done before they got here.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.880
Well, that can't be a coincidence.

34:15.240 --> 34:16.480
I don't know what it is.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.240
-(GASPING)
-It's okay. It's okay.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.560
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.320
It's okay.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.080
Where's Mum?

35:02.720 --> 35:05.040
She was here.
She was needed in the hospital.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.040
You want some water?

35:14.600 --> 35:16.280
I couldn't believe it when I saw you.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.640
I should never have
let you get onto that ship.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.400
-It's not your fault.
-I thought I'd never see you again.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.960
All this time you were with them?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.680
(BREATHING HEAVILY) What do you mean?

35:36.560 --> 35:38.120
You've been gone for months.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.760
What did they do to you?

35:50.440 --> 35:51.440
Emily?

35:53.920 --> 35:55.120
I can’t remember.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.000
I saw Bill.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.560
He's here. He's okay.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.640
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

36:10.920 --> 36:14.960
I promised I’d get your mum as soon
as you were awake. Will you be okay?

36:35.160 --> 36:36.200
You can't give up.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.920
You keep telling me Emily's still alive.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.040
-I want to believe you.
-You should.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.040
Because you feel it?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.320
-You still don't trust me?
-Get some sleep.

'cause I wanted it to be true.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.520
We're only alive because of Sacha.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.240
Maybe we should try to
have faith in him.

It expands and contracts
with the changes in temperature.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.480
JONATHAN: Yeah.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.360
Yeah, I thought so.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.040
I was wondering what it was.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.720
MARK: There's a map on the table.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.800
I've marked the location
of a group in Mile End.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.160
Maybe your family's there.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.320
Thanks.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Thank you.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.320
What are you gonna do?

39:01.120 --> 39:03.200
People were talking like
it was gonna be D-Day.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.560
It was supposed to change everything.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.360
It's over. They won.

39:13.720 --> 39:14.880
Yeah.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.480
Yeah. We can’t think like that...

39:19.560 --> 39:21.840
No, you have to know
when you're beat, and they beat us.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.120
I'm so tired.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.280
I just want it to be over.

MOKRANI: (IN ENGLISH) Hey, hey.
Why did you come here?

40:25.600 --> 40:29.440
-Why did you come here?
-(WEAKLY) The source of the music.

40:32.760 --> 40:36.920
The music we sent into space.
You traced the signal?

40:38.520 --> 40:39.920
Hm.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.800
MOKRANI:
Do your people know we are here?

40:43.080 --> 40:45.560
-MICAH: No.
-MOKRANI: Who shot you?

40:47.040 --> 40:48.160
My brother.

40:49.320 --> 40:54.280
You said you were looking for this man,
Professor Bill Ward. Who is he?

40:56.280 --> 40:58.240
He's responsible for our suffering.

41:01.760 --> 41:05.080
-We can change it.
-What do you mean?

41:06.240 --> 41:07.560
MICAH: It's not too late.

41:09.440 --> 41:12.800
What are these equations?
Can you explain them?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.120
It's a formula.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.640
It measures the torsion
within the monopole.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.480
A magnetic monopole?

41:24.160 --> 41:27.280
You can detect them? You've seen them?

41:27.520 --> 41:31.400
They're part of the nature
of all things.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.840
MOKRANI: Hey. Hey. Hey.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.600
-Can you revive him?
-GRETA: His wound is infected.

41:40.880 --> 41:44.120
We can give him antibiotics,
but it's the last course we have.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.480
They may not even work.

41:46.680 --> 41:50.920
MOKRANI: Do what you can, but we keep
the antibiotics for our own people.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.440
(IN FRENCH)
We should give him the antibiotics.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.800
We need to understand
what he's talking about.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.720
And if we need them
to treat someone else?

42:02.800 --> 42:04.160
Maybe this is more important.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.720
More important than the lives
of the other people here?

42:07.920 --> 42:09.440
What if your sister is hurt?

42:10.240 --> 42:11.600
It's more important than her life?

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
No.

42:15.680 --> 42:16.680
(IN ENGLISH) Okay.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.520
(IN FRENCH)
Then we don't give him the antibiotics.

ASH: How mad is that?

42:38.640 --> 42:40.360
Must be weird for you seeing her again.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.400
What do you mean?

42:45.320 --> 42:47.000
'Cause after what happened with Helen...

42:51.960 --> 42:53.360
I'm just glad she's alive.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.440
She was on that ship
with them for months.

42:58.520 --> 42:59.640
What were they doing with her?

43:15.920 --> 43:17.200
(IN FRENCH) What's this?

43:18.320 --> 43:21.200
It belongs to the alien guy.
I think it's his journal.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.200
-They keep journals?
-Hm.

43:26.480 --> 43:27.760
What is all that?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.360
They're quantum equations.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.440
This is the Planck constant.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.480
I think this represents
wave particle duality.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
The rest I don't understand.

I don't know.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.120
He said he was looking for him.

43:57.840 --> 44:01.360
This... This biological weapon
that you're working on,

44:01.720 --> 44:03.200
how soon can it be ready?

44:03.400 --> 44:06.080
Well, I've already identified
the strands of DNA

44:06.160 --> 44:08.880
I can infect them with,
but I need to run some trials.

44:09.280 --> 44:15.040
If we release it before we’re sure,
it could infect us as well as them.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.480
There's so few of us left.

44:19.960 --> 44:22.280
We're out of options.
We might have to take the risk.

44:22.360 --> 44:27.040
Yes, but if we release it
before it's ready, it could wipe us out.

44:30.520 --> 44:31.520
There she is.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.640
Hello, Emily.

44:43.600 --> 44:47.400

We were all so worried about you.

44:52.560 --> 44:55.600
-This is... This is Zoe.
-Hi.

45:07.280 --> 45:11.240
We'd, um... We’d like to talk to you
about what happened

45:11.320 --> 45:12.600
when you were on the ship.

45:13.680 --> 45:15.840
Anything you can tell us
would be really helpful.

-No.
