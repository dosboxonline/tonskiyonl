What happened here?

02:16.375 --> 02:19.250
Dijkstra and Philippa weren't
the only ones scheming at Thanedd.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.833
They suspect
Vilgefortz conspired with Nilfgaard,

02:22.916 --> 02:25.791
and Emhyr var Emreis took
the whole Continent by surprise.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.875
[Radovid] You should go. You don't need
to stay here listening to me.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.375
We have to get you out of here.

02:40.458 --> 02:44.333
There's an old trappers' route,
up where the village diverts in Mirthe.

02:44.416 --> 02:46.458
It'll get you as far as Oxenfurt.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.500
I have friends there with a safe house.
Give them this.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.000
-It'll get you to the capital.

I've got an annuity.
I'll bring all I can.

-You don't understand.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.208
The war brewing outside is nothing

03:11.291 --> 03:14.875
compared to what Geralt will unleash
on this Continent to find his daughter.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.250
I don't know what happens next.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.625
Just let me be there with you.
Prove that I'm more than a mask.

03:32.750 --> 03:33.625
Maybe.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.041
After I find Ciri.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.583
You should find Geralt first.

03:41.708 --> 03:42.625
Why?

03:43.666 --> 03:45.375
I saw that tower explode.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.666
Felt it like a shockwave.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.000
I don't see how
she could've made it, Jaskier.

04:13.791 --> 04:15.291

-[sighs]

04:15.958 --> 04:18.083
She was seen at Tor Lara, but…

04:18.166 --> 04:20.500
But I've searched the rubble,
I can't find her.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.041
And Geralt?

04:23.833 --> 04:26.833
Triss is taking him to Brokilon. To heal.

04:27.791 --> 04:29.000
He might be dying.

04:29.625 --> 04:30.500
Shit.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.000
This is bad.

[woman 1] I'll go find them.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.125

I've dreamt about you.

19:14.791 --> 19:16.833
-We should have had more time.
-I know.

19:17.541 --> 19:21.916
You've spent your whole life
trying to find a place where you belong.

19:23.208 --> 19:24.250
And yet…

19:25.791 --> 19:26.875
here you are.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.583
Abandoned once more.

19:29.666 --> 19:31.458
[echoing] Abandoned… once more…

19:31.541 --> 19:32.958
[Ciri] I wasn't abandoned.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.500
Geralt said he'll find me.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.875
Nothing's ever your fault, is it?

19:37.625 --> 19:41.333
Your loved ones, the people in your life,
they all want to do their best by you.

19:41.416 --> 19:43.500
-But it's not enough, I'm afraid.
-What?

19:43.583 --> 19:46.583
Don't play stupid, Cirilla.
You know this in your soul.

19:46.666 --> 19:47.666
They're my family.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.250
-They love me.
-As did your father and I.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.500
But you, my child…

19:56.666 --> 19:58.583
are a heavy weight to bear.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.166
Why are you saying all this?

20:00.250 --> 20:04.583
I can only imagine how relieved
Geralt was to see you run into that tower.

20:04.666 --> 20:08.250
Perhaps, when you get down to it,
you are too much for everyone.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.791
-No, you don't know me!
-[Pavetta] …too much for everyone…

20:10.875 --> 20:12.125
You abandoned me!

20:12.708 --> 20:16.125
You went on that boat,
and you didn't take me with you!

20:16.625 --> 20:17.625
Why?

20:28.500 --> 20:30.833
[wheezing] I see you, you little fucker!

20:30.916 --> 20:32.333
[grunts]

20:32.416 --> 20:34.333
[roars]

20:41.666 --> 20:42.708
[retches]

20:45.458 --> 20:46.750
I don't feel so good.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.250
[groans]

20:49.916 --> 20:53.083
[Pavetta, echoing]
Abandoned, once more… abandoned…

20:53.791 --> 20:57.083
-[Ciri] Geralt and Yennefer need me.
-[female voice] They didn't survive…

20:57.166 --> 20:58.291
Would you like a story?

20:58.375 --> 21:00.583
-[Pavetta] You are too much…
-Geralt and Yennefer need me.

21:00.666 --> 21:02.166
-Find a place where you belong.
-Geralt…

21:02.250 --> 21:03.708
[Calanthe shouts] Wake up, Cirilla!

21:08.083 --> 21:09.083
What have you done?

21:13.625 --> 21:16.041
-[Pavetta] Heavy weight to bear…
-[Calanthe] Pathetic…

21:16.125 --> 21:17.458
[Pavetta] Abandoned once more…

21:17.541 --> 21:19.375
-Heavy…
-[Calanthe] You know where you are?

21:20.083 --> 21:21.041
[voice] Just reach out…

21:25.000 --> 21:26.500
[gasping]

21:27.625 --> 21:29.166
-[men laughing]
-What--

21:35.625 --> 21:36.541
A tip.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.416
-Don't eat the lizards.
-[echoing whisper] …lizards…

21:39.500 --> 21:41.458
-They're poison.
-[Ciri] Where am I?

21:43.041 --> 21:44.125
Who are you?

21:44.208 --> 21:46.083
-Good questions.
-[echoing whisper] …questions…

21:46.166 --> 21:49.583
I am the past, and this is the future.

21:49.666 --> 21:50.958
…the future…

21:51.041 --> 21:53.625
-Well, a possible one.
-…possible one…

21:53.708 --> 21:56.291
[Ciri] It's not the first time
I've seen the future.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.791
What is this place?

21:58.875 --> 22:02.166
You may come to know it.
Like I said, it's a possibility.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.083
-Could be one of many futures.
-…possible…

22:04.166 --> 22:08.125
-It all depends on what you decide.
-[sighs] I'm going insane.

22:08.791 --> 22:12.000
Powerful women have been labelled insane
since the dawn of time.

22:12.083 --> 22:15.791
It's bullshit.
Always has been, always will be.

22:15.875 --> 22:18.541
-History repeating itself…
-…repeating itself…

22:18.625 --> 22:21.541
Something we have in common.
Both insane princesses,

22:21.625 --> 22:24.208
abandoned by the people
who were supposed to protect us,

22:24.291 --> 22:26.125
and royally fucked over by our families.

22:26.708 --> 22:29.958
At least yours had the decency
to die on their own. I had to kill mine.

22:30.541 --> 22:32.583
-You killed your family?
-[whisper] …father…

22:32.666 --> 22:35.958
-Most importantly, my father, the failure.
-…failure…

22:36.041 --> 22:38.666
Honestly, it was the system
that failed me most.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.291
Father was just a spoke in a wheel

22:41.375 --> 22:43.708
that had been rolling for generations.

22:44.625 --> 22:46.250
Do you think it'll ever change?

22:46.333 --> 22:50.291
-More good questions!
-…questions…

22:50.375 --> 22:54.833
How many more times
will history have to repeat itself?

22:54.916 --> 22:57.125
A spoke in a wheel… spoke in a wheel…

22:59.625 --> 23:00.875
Can I tell you something?

23:04.750 --> 23:07.000
I think I have the power to change things.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.416
You're not the first person
to feel that way.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.625
…not the first…

23:13.125 --> 23:15.166
But you, my friend,

23:15.250 --> 23:16.750
…friend… friend… friend…

23:16.833 --> 23:18.958
…you could be the last.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.041
…could be the last… the last…

23:21.125 --> 23:22.041
[Ciri] Hello?

23:23.250 --> 23:24.166
Hello?

23:25.166 --> 23:26.125
Please.

23:28.416 --> 23:29.791
Please don't abandon me.

23:31.125 --> 23:33.125
[low rumbling]

23:42.541 --> 23:44.541

[unicorn neighs]

24:06.541 --> 24:07.875
[whickers]

24:09.750 --> 24:13.083
I don't feel so good, Little Horse.

24:13.916 --> 24:16.500
Vesemir called this the Frying Pan.

24:16.583 --> 24:17.500
[whimpers]

24:17.583 --> 24:19.416
Now I understand why.

24:22.166 --> 24:23.916
Will you let me pet you?

24:24.833 --> 24:27.000
-I need to know you're real.
-[nickering]

24:38.541 --> 24:39.625
[whinnies]

24:41.708 --> 24:44.625
Fine. What do you want, anyway?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.375
Hey, wait!

24:51.625 --> 24:53.041
Where are you going?

24:54.833 --> 24:55.750
Wait!

25:08.666 --> 25:10.500
Is this what you wanted to show me?

25:12.458 --> 25:15.500
[sighs] Little Horse, I can't keep going.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.125
[whinnies]

25:19.541 --> 25:21.125
[neighs and snorts]

25:22.416 --> 25:23.666
[gasps]

25:23.750 --> 25:25.750
[low rumbling]

25:27.708 --> 25:30.333
Chaos. In the earth.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.791
The air.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.416
The water.

25:35.916 --> 25:38.250
There's a vein here. [gasps]

25:43.083 --> 25:44.291
[water sloshes]

25:44.375 --> 25:45.916
[hopeful music]

25:49.750 --> 25:51.208
Oh!

25:52.041 --> 25:53.875
Oh, it's real! [gasps]

25:57.750 --> 25:59.083
[gasps]

25:59.708 --> 26:01.000
[shudders]

26:02.833 --> 26:05.125
Come, you must be thirsty too. Drink.

26:07.125 --> 26:09.083
Thank you. Thank you.

26:12.541 --> 26:13.708
[sobs]

26:20.250 --> 26:22.208
[inspiring music]

26:24.000 --> 26:25.458
[buzzing]

26:31.041 --> 26:32.875
[unicorn nickers]

26:34.250 --> 26:36.375
All right, I'm coming.

26:40.875 --> 26:44.541
Have I told you about Roach yet?
You'd really like her.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.541
[inspiring music continues]

27:25.666 --> 27:26.916
Wait here, friend.

27:37.041 --> 27:38.166
[music fades]

27:40.833 --> 27:42.708
Clearly no food to be found here.

27:44.458 --> 27:45.958
[Calanthe] Disgusting.

27:49.416 --> 27:50.458
Go away.

27:50.541 --> 27:52.958
I know you're nothing but an illusion.

27:53.041 --> 27:56.583
[Calanthe] How dare you
strike such a tone with me?

27:56.666 --> 27:58.666
[echoing] …such a tone with me…

28:02.333 --> 28:04.541
The Lion Cub of Cintra.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.041
Pathetic.

28:06.125 --> 28:08.750
-Pathetic…
-You're not real!

28:08.833 --> 28:11.208
-I know it.
-Don't you know where you are?

28:11.291 --> 28:14.083
The largest graveyard on the Continent.

28:14.166 --> 28:15.708
[giggling]

28:15.791 --> 28:17.208
You want me to die?

28:17.291 --> 28:19.541
[Calanthe] I want you

28:20.291 --> 28:23.250
to wake the fuck up.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.333
[echoing shout] Wake up, Cirilla!

28:26.583 --> 28:29.083
[whispering] People fear you.

28:29.750 --> 28:33.291
[echoing] Aim to use you
for their own agendas

28:33.375 --> 28:36.333
while your loved ones
are falling by the wayside.

28:36.416 --> 28:38.875
And what have you done
to prepare for the coming war?

28:38.958 --> 28:42.083
What have you done? What have you…
What have you done?

28:43.500 --> 28:45.125
[roars] Nothing!

28:45.208 --> 28:48.166
When death came for me,
it was on my terms.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.208
-That's what good leaders do.
-What have you done?

28:50.291 --> 28:52.250
They stand up to the enemy.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.041
You've hidden yourself away all this time.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.458
You've done nothing.

28:56.541 --> 28:59.166
[shouts] And now you're hiding
in this desert!

28:59.250 --> 29:00.166
-Admit it!
-No!

29:00.250 --> 29:02.333
You led yourself

29:02.416 --> 29:05.583
and Cintra into dust and oblivion.

29:05.666 --> 29:07.458
You were ruled by hubris and fear,

29:07.541 --> 29:11.208
and so instead of helping people,
you led into a cycle of violence.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.833
You let history repeat itself.

29:14.541 --> 29:18.041
You murdered people like me.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.833
[sobs] You spilled elven blood.

29:22.333 --> 29:23.333
My blood!

29:23.916 --> 29:25.125
[sobs] And for what?

29:25.750 --> 29:28.375
Death came for you in the end anyway.

29:32.166 --> 29:34.958
There has to be another way.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.000
Do you really think that someone like you…

29:38.083 --> 29:42.125
could change things
where countless others have failed?

29:42.208 --> 29:44.958
You couldn't lead a horse to water!

29:45.041 --> 29:46.708
[laughing]

29:46.791 --> 29:48.541
Shut up! [roars]

29:48.625 --> 29:50.250
[Calanthe's laughter fading]

29:51.125 --> 29:52.333
[screams] Fuck!

29:53.291 --> 29:55.083
[wind gusting]

29:58.833 --> 29:59.916
[woman] Another tip?

30:00.625 --> 30:02.166
Don't punch rocks.

30:03.458 --> 30:06.291
-I wondered if I'd see you again.
-Miss me already?

30:06.375 --> 30:07.416
I don't know you.

30:09.250 --> 30:12.916
Only conversations I've had are with
my subconscious urging me to kill myself.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.625
How are you so sure
I'm not trying to do the same?

30:15.708 --> 30:18.708
-Remains to be seen.
-[laughs]

30:23.166 --> 30:25.666
You told me
I could be the last to change things.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.000
-What did you mean?
-You know you're powerful.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.291
Is that another thing we have in common?

30:30.375 --> 30:33.041
I always had a talent
for attracting friends.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.458
I should have been queen.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.375
But when my father denied me
my royal destiny,

30:37.458 --> 30:39.583
I decided to rally the common folk.

30:39.666 --> 30:43.291
And with their help,
I took back what was rightfully mine

30:43.375 --> 30:46.625
in the only way I knew
would send an unforgettable message.

30:46.708 --> 30:49.916
-Blood and fire.
-I've heard that story.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.791
Fitting, since in the end,

30:51.875 --> 30:54.833
they tied me to a stake
and burned me alive.

30:56.083 --> 30:56.958
[Ciri gasps]

30:57.791 --> 30:58.625
You're Falka.

31:01.666 --> 31:03.458
The stories say you were a demon.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.000
A cursed elven monster.

31:07.083 --> 31:10.291
Stories created to convince
naughty children to do their chores.

31:11.375 --> 31:14.208
In the end, it was much easier
to cut my ears into points

31:14.291 --> 31:16.875
and let myself be
what they accused me of being.

31:17.833 --> 31:18.958
For simplicity's sake.

31:19.041 --> 31:22.375
-You filled entire streets with blood!
-Whose blood?

31:23.166 --> 31:25.666
Those who wished to use me or kill me.

31:27.083 --> 31:28.541
You think you're cursed.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.583
But do you know
what I see when I look at you?

31:34.875 --> 31:35.791
What?

31:36.583 --> 31:37.541
A child.

31:38.708 --> 31:41.750
Run through a meat grinder
by her own family.

31:43.791 --> 31:46.541
They lied to you and left you vulnerable.

31:46.625 --> 31:47.791
[sighs]

31:48.291 --> 31:51.125
They left you to feel shame
instead of pride.

31:51.916 --> 31:53.958
Self-loathing instead of love.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.750
Fear instead of acceptance.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.416
You murdered your father.
You started a rebellion.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.166
But what did you actually want?

32:02.250 --> 32:05.958
I wanted the freedom to feel my rage.

32:07.041 --> 32:10.041
To stop shaming myself
for what I could not control.

32:10.666 --> 32:14.375
You want to change the system,
Princess Cirilla?

32:17.125 --> 32:18.750
Burn it to the ground.

32:18.833 --> 32:20.708
