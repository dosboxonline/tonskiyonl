02:55.922 --> 03:01.611
Once, in a time before time,
God breathed life into the universe.

03:01.611 --> 03:08.097
And the light gave birth to Angels.
And the earth gave birth to man.

03:08.097 --> 03:17.040
And fire gave birth to the Djinn. Creatures
condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds.

03:17.040 --> 03:21.778
One who wakes a Djinn shall be given three wishes.

03:21.978 --> 03:30.236
Upon the granting of the third, the unholy legions
of the Djinn shall be freed upon the earth.

03:30.436 --> 03:40.630
Fear one thing only in all that is...
Fear the Djinn.

03:40.999 --> 03:43.167
Make your second wish.

03:43.367 --> 03:47.308
Astonish Me, Djinn.
Show me wonders.

03:47.746 --> 03:50.279
As you wish.

04:44.490 --> 04:46.938
Help me, sorcerer.
Help me!

05:34.122 --> 05:37.616
Free us wizard.
Remove this curse.

05:37.616 --> 05:39.893
Help us.

05:46.833 --> 05:51.655
Behold. By all the names of God,
This is not what I wanted!

05:52.040 --> 05:55.488
Then wish it away exalted one.
Wish it away.

05:56.234 --> 05:57.874
Stop!

05:58.192 --> 05:59.141
No more wishes.

05:59.404 --> 06:01.183
I beg your majesty. Silence.

06:01.183 --> 06:03.457
But my poor people.
I must...

06:03.457 --> 06:06.238
Do you wish their fate on the entire world?

06:06.238 --> 06:08.864
No more wishes. Please.

06:09.349 --> 06:13.139
I warned you, wizard.
Hold your tongue.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.906
I'm the wish, is all this creature needs.

06:15.906 --> 06:19.148
Three wishes granted
to the one who woke him

06:19.148 --> 06:21.918
lets him open the gateway between worlds.

06:21.918 --> 06:24.409
New wonders, majesty.

06:24.409 --> 06:27.140
New splendors.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.864
And new and terrible masters.

06:29.864 --> 06:32.222
Yes...

07:38.845 --> 07:42.513
(America, present day)

07:58.557 --> 08:01.245
I'm surprised you're here in person Mr. Beaumont.

08:01.245 --> 08:02.954
Paperwork is completely in order.

08:02.954 --> 08:06.334
I waited it ten years, for this piece.

08:06.512 --> 08:10.988
Antiquarian sculpture.
Eight foot tall.

08:10.988 --> 08:16.721
A statue of the pre-Islamic God,
Ahura Mazda.

08:16.721 --> 08:20.281
Under Islam, these gods were outlawed.

08:20.937 --> 08:24.393
It's a miracle this was ever made.

08:35.692 --> 08:37.187
Jesus Christ!

08:37.187 --> 08:39.076
What the hell is he doing?

08:39.275 --> 08:41.072
God dammit!

08:41.072 --> 08:43.852
Does the word DUMB ASS
mean anything to you?

08:43.852 --> 08:46.079
Watch that crate!
That's very expensive stuff!

08:46.079 --> 08:47.057
Up yours...

08:47.057 --> 08:48.610
...ahh shit!

08:59.079 --> 09:03.704
Ughhhh. Ten years...

09:54.407 --> 09:56.032
Hi. I can help you?

09:56.032 --> 09:59.676
Maybe. I got a pawnshop down
the garment district,

09:59.676 --> 10:02.665
5th and Tooley. The armpit of the universe.

10:02.665 --> 10:06.039
Anyway, this came in this morning.

10:06.039 --> 10:10.836
I had a hunch about it. Gave the guy a good price,
and I'd like you to appraise it.

10:10.836 --> 10:13.404
Well, I think you made a smart move.

10:13.974 --> 10:15.725
- Nick?
- Shannon?

10:15.725 --> 10:19.154
I think we have something
Alex should take a look at.

10:19.154 --> 10:21.623
Hello Betty!

10:22.832 --> 10:25.705
Wow. This is ah... uh, this...

10:26.801 --> 10:27.882
Which is its providence?

10:27.882 --> 10:28.575
What?

10:28.575 --> 10:31.501
History. Where did it come from?

10:31.430 --> 10:34.257
Oh! I bought it from a guy
he said he got it from his grandmother.

10:34.257 --> 10:35.068
That's all I know.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.194
I've heard that one before.

10:37.194 --> 10:40.567
I tell you what. I want to have my
best appraiser take a look at this.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.631
Shannon here is going to
fill out a receipt for you.

10:42.631 --> 10:46.431
And thank you for, uh... choosing Regal Auctioneering.

10:46.431 --> 10:48.144
Sure.

10:59.672 --> 11:00.948
I guess that's it.

11:01.602 --> 11:02.435
I guess it is.

11:02.435 --> 11:03.902
Nice game.

11:06.996 --> 11:10.821
How is um... Rick ?

11:10.821 --> 11:15.322
I don't know. I haven't spoken to him.
It's over.

11:15.322 --> 11:19.143
What's it been now? Six and a half weeks?

11:19.143 --> 11:20.156
Seven.

11:21.123 --> 11:22.910
Are you counting?

11:24.032 --> 11:27.391
I thought. Maybe we, uh...

11:28.188 --> 11:29.010
- What?

11:29.010 --> 11:30.477
I thought maybe we could go out.

11:30.477 --> 11:32.591
We go out all the time.

11:33.373 --> 11:38.082
Yes, we go out all the time,
but we don't "Go Out".

11:38.082 --> 11:38.984
There's a difference.

11:38.984 --> 11:42.682
You are my best friend.
Do you know hard a friend is to find?

11:42.682 --> 11:45.746
I dont wanna...
I do not want to mess that up.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.068
Dates are a dime a dozen.

11:47.068 --> 11:51.403
Aw come on now. It's so old.
It's a date.

11:53.050 --> 11:55.498
Wait. You know what it is?
I'm just...

11:56.563 --> 12:00.343
I'm just worried about losing
what little I've got left now.

12:00.343 --> 12:01.921
Including you.

12:03.049 --> 12:04.514
How about dinner and a movie?

12:04.992 --> 12:07.176
How about hotdogs and a ball game?

12:07.176 --> 12:09.285
Playing it safe, huh?

12:11.876 --> 12:14.970
I am going out on a limb here.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.565
I'm casting a spell on you here Alex.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.453
Maybe it'll work.

12:30.912 --> 12:32.126
Hey.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.436
I'll see you later.

12:37.436 --> 12:38.960
I'll be at the lab.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.570
Hey Alex.
Think about what I said.

13:05.168 --> 13:09.460
My god. A fire opal this size.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.725
It's magnificent.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.320
How magnificent?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.763
Excellent translucence.

13:18.279 --> 13:20.456
No other color traces.

13:23.383 --> 13:25.101
It's unique.

13:25.055 --> 13:28.522
Oh that's a good word.
Oh I love that word.

13:28.522 --> 13:30.316
"Unique"

13:30.316 --> 13:32.947
Should that show quite a price? Yeah?

13:32.947 --> 13:34.633
Oh yes.

13:34.633 --> 13:38.562
- I am salivating. Get me a report ASAP?
- Yes.

13:39.926 --> 13:41.346
- Nick?
- Hmm?

13:41.346 --> 13:42.160
Leave.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.181
- Oh, ummm.
- Yes!

13:57.974 --> 13:59.737
What's this?

14:19.313 --> 14:23.617
You woke me.

14:30.425 --> 14:36.333
You woke me.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.594
What?

15:00.919 --> 15:03.101
I didn't hear you come in,
you scared me. I...

15:03.606 --> 15:05.591
What's the verdict?

15:07.237 --> 15:11.775
I think...  ...there may
be something wrong with it.

15:13.232 --> 15:14.484
Does it affect the value?

15:14.484 --> 15:16.868
I have to talk to a friend of mine.
We're gonna have to run some more tests.

15:16.868 --> 15:20.620
Tests?
Like what? A physical?

15:35.835 --> 15:38.657
- There'something inside of it?
- Right.

15:40.454 --> 15:43.449
I don't know. I'm no gemmologist.

15:43.449 --> 15:47.877
I could run some spectral analysis,
infrared. Get some readings.

15:47.877 --> 15:49.405
That'd be great. Can you do it now?

15:49.568 --> 15:53.940
Oh hoh no. Hold on.
I got about two hours worth of

15:53.940 --> 15:58.048
Professor Leiber's bullshit to take of first.
I'll get to it as soon as I can.

15:58.949 --> 16:00.164
Come on. Do you want to stay?

16:00.164 --> 16:03.654
No, I can't. I have got to put my
girls through their basis.

16:04.490 --> 16:08.084
Thanks. This is really important.
So call me later. Okay?

16:08.084 --> 16:10.265
You're the best Josh.
I owe ya.

16:10.474 --> 16:13.395
Yeah. Well, how about that dinner then?

16:21.093 --> 16:22.443
Time-out.

16:22.443 --> 16:25.197
You.
That was very good.

16:25.197 --> 16:26.813
Very good. Do you know why you missed?

16:26.813 --> 16:27.485
Huh-uh.

16:27.485 --> 16:29.019
You didn't have stillness.

16:29.019 --> 16:32.237
All of you can put the ball in the hoops
as long as you take your time.

16:32.237 --> 16:34.445
take a breath.
Get your aim. Right?

16:34.445 --> 16:36.292
But you don't always have that time in a game.

16:36.292 --> 16:38.920
Somebody is always going to be trying
to take the ball away from you,

16:38.920 --> 16:43.221
and that's when you need stillness.
Not in your body. Your mind.

16:43.221 --> 16:45.575
When you get a chance to make a shot,

16:45.575 --> 16:49.676
you've got to forget about everything else.
Time doesn't exist.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.091
The other players do not exist.

16:52.091 --> 16:54.113
It is you and the basket.

16:54.673 --> 16:57.943
You see it, you find it.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.261
Shoot the ball.

17:13.299 --> 17:16.816
Laser targeting for analysis

17:25.916 --> 17:28.751
Wow. This is the easiest date you
have ever gotten Aickman.

17:36.886 --> 17:38.996
What is that?

17:42.724 --> 17:47.727
You awoke me.

17:53.653 --> 17:56.096
End laser scanning.

17:56.096 --> 17:58.139
End the laser scan Dammit!

18:45.398 --> 18:49.048
"Hi. Geophysics. We're probably
changing lead into gold right now."

18:49.048 --> 18:51.094
So, leave a message.

18:52.487 --> 18:54.697
Josh, it is Alex,
you are there?

18:54.697 --> 18:56.955
- Josh, something
- Alex

18:56.955 --> 19:00.968
really weird happened to me on the court,
and I really need to talk about it.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.987
Is somebody there?

19:07.187 --> 19:11.894
- Yes.
- Oh my god.

19:30.637 --> 19:34.288
- Is the pain terrible?
- Oh god.

19:34.288 --> 19:36.093
I can help you with that.

19:37.584 --> 19:41.386
I can ease your suffering.

19:42.717 --> 19:46.494
All you have to do is ask.

19:47.732 --> 19:51.279
Tell me you want the pain to cease

19:54.417 --> 19:55.904
Yes.

19:57.929 --> 20:00.031
As you wish.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
{\an8}Top<font color="#ffff00">Teo</font>.com

20:41.488 --> 20:45.237
Oh my god...

21:21.459 --> 21:22.773
Josh!

21:30.850 --> 21:34.472
Computer malfunction. It must
have been one hell of a computer.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.216
- Josh.
- Hey!

21:43.216 --> 21:45.836
- Josh. JOSH!
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey miss.

21:46.036 --> 21:48.126
- Hey lady. Lady. Hey hey.
- Josh! Josh!

21:48.326 --> 21:49.575
Is he? Is he?

21:49.575 --> 21:51.483
Get off of me!

21:53.369 --> 21:54.885
I'm sorry.

21:55.212 --> 21:56.661
I'm detective Nathan.

21:56.661 --> 21:57.865
And you are?

21:59.340 --> 22:01.960
Alex Amberson.

22:02.575 --> 22:05.947
Alex Amberson.
Alright? Good.

22:06.588 --> 22:10.055
I take it that you knew the...
um, Josh.

22:10.670 --> 22:13.369
He was my best friend.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.855
I'm sorry.

22:17.491 --> 22:19.143
Look, uh.
You want to have a seat?

22:19.143 --> 22:21.804
No. I want to know what happened.

22:23.202 --> 22:25.019
It looks like an accident.

22:25.019 --> 22:27.197
An equipment malfaunction maybe.

22:28.721 --> 22:31.580
You have any idea what he was working on?

22:31.580 --> 22:35.532
He was analysing...

22:35.532 --> 22:37.762
...a gem stone.

22:37.762 --> 22:39.400
Opal.

22:40.187 --> 22:42.055
For me.

22:50.112 --> 22:52.842
Excuse me lady. Uh.
Help out an old altar boy?

22:52.842 --> 22:55.227
If you ain't got no change, a dollar will do it.

22:55.227 --> 22:58.385
Hell, I'll even take five.
I'll wait until you get back.

23:08.459 --> 23:10.359
Look. How many times do I gotta tell you?

23:10.359 --> 23:13.238
Hey, you left customers in there.
That's not a good way to run a business.

23:13.238 --> 23:14.745
Don't tell me how to run my business.

23:14.745 --> 23:15.824
You're a fucking bum.

23:17.572 --> 23:21.704
Well you don't tell me how to run my life.
You're a fucking prick.

23:21.704 --> 23:25.625
I'll talk to anybody I want to.
You don't own this fucking sidewalk.

23:25.625 --> 23:28.502
You wanna know something?
I do own this fucking sidewalk.

23:28.502 --> 23:31.408
You wanna know why?
Because I pay fucking taxes.

23:31.408 --> 23:32.531
Fuck you.

23:32.531 --> 23:34.545
No. Fuck you.

23:34.545 --> 23:37.595
I hope you die, you sack of shit.

23:37.595 --> 23:40.770
I hope you die, and I hope you
float down the gutter

23:40.770 --> 23:43.612
so I can fuck'n piss on ya.

23:43.612 --> 23:47.295
Bald headed baboon.

23:47.295 --> 23:51.903
Piss complected afterbirth
to a Chinese gang banger.

23:52.041 --> 23:54.047
Educated idiot!

23:54.047 --> 23:57.679
"I own the sidewalk."
"I pay taxes"

23:57.679 --> 23:59.428
I got your taxes swinging.

23:59.428 --> 24:01.985
I tell you what to do with your taxes.

24:01.985 --> 24:03.941
And I hope they poke a
hole into your kidneys

24:03.941 --> 24:05.930
when they are heading up
towards your throat.

24:07.243 --> 24:10.611
I hope you rot in hell.
And that goes for your...

24:12.978 --> 24:14.479
Who is that?

24:15.894 --> 24:18.476
A friend, perhaps.

24:18.855 --> 24:22.009
Tell me...

24:23.197 --> 24:27.394
Do you really mean those curses
you hurled so freely?

24:28.253 --> 24:30.630
Damned right I did.

24:30.630 --> 24:34.192
What would you do
to have them come true?

24:35.273 --> 24:38.646
A cigarette and a handshake
is about all I got right now pal.

24:38.646 --> 24:42.652
Not quite.
You have a soul.

24:42.652 --> 24:46.168
That, I'd trade for a shower and a jug of Jack.

24:46.168 --> 24:50.228
Then the death of your enemy would consider a bargain.

24:50.228 --> 24:53.647
You really are fucked up.
You know that?

24:53.647 --> 24:56.789
But I do like the way you think.

24:56.789 --> 25:01.406
Indulge me then.
What would you have happen?

25:01.406 --> 25:03.760
Give it some thought.

25:04.756 --> 25:07.512
Enjoy it.

25:09.418 --> 25:12.055
He should only get cancer.

25:16.477 --> 25:19.588
Should only get cancer and die.

25:19.588 --> 25:22.192
As you wish.

25:22.004 --> 25:24.795
Welfare checks. Food stamps.

25:24.795 --> 25:27.420
And another thing I...

25:28.046 --> 25:30.425
Hey buddy, you Okay?

25:38.283 --> 25:39.762
- You okay?
- I do not know.

25:41.715 --> 25:43.193
Let her. Let her...
Let her go.

26:02.673 --> 26:05.348
Was it worth it?

26:16.458 --> 26:18.604
Run, insect.

26:18.604 --> 26:22.087
Run and tell those you will,
what you will.

26:22.087 --> 26:25.709
Tell them there is something
loose in their city.

26:26.476 --> 26:30.806
Something which feeds on wishes,

26:35.645 --> 26:38.475
but tell them quickly.

26:38.475 --> 26:41.667
while you still have a soul.

27:02.991 --> 27:06.212
Hey.
You're not enjoying it.

27:06.212 --> 27:08.381
Put it out.

27:14.122 --> 27:17.010
I am really sorry about Josh.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.423
I know how close you guys were.

27:22.755 --> 27:26.409
No, we were'nt as close as he wanted,
and now it's just to...

27:27.288 --> 27:29.513
Alex. Listen to me.

27:29.513 --> 27:31.700
What happened to Josh
is not your fault.

27:34.122 --> 27:35.617
I think it is.

27:35.617 --> 27:37.162
What?

27:41.233 --> 27:46.926
There was something...
...weird, in the opal.

27:47.635 --> 27:49.777
I think that was what exploded.

27:51.453 --> 27:54.441
I think what I gave Josh is what killed him.

27:54.441 --> 27:57.322
Do you have any idea how
crazy that sounds?

27:58.241 --> 28:03.838
Yes. I know exactly how crazy it sounds.
That's the problem.

28:08.483 --> 28:13.908
Do you, um...
Do you want me to call Dr. Montiglio again?

28:13.908 --> 28:15.863
No.

28:17.898 --> 28:19.479
I'm fine.

28:19.479 --> 28:22.097
I'm just upset.

28:22.097 --> 28:24.696
You're not just upset.

28:24.696 --> 28:27.647
You're imagining things,
just like the last time.

28:27.647 --> 28:30.244
This is nothing like the last time Shannon.

28:31.514 --> 28:32.710
Why don't you go to bed?

28:32.710 --> 28:34.468
I don't want you to worry.

28:34.468 --> 28:37.950
Can you can the "Big Sister Act"
for just one night?

28:38.332 --> 28:41.755
The fire was years ago.
You got me out. Okay?

28:41.755 --> 28:43.544
I got you out.
I didn't get mom out.

28:43.544 --> 28:44.827
I didn't get dad out.

28:44.827 --> 28:47.478
Not "Didn't".
"Couldn't".

28:47.478 --> 28:51.471
Could not. Not your fault.

28:51.471 --> 28:54.774
Just like Josh, it's not your fault Alex.

28:55.288 --> 28:57.617
You really gotta stop
blaming yourself,

28:57.617 --> 29:00.146
or the whole fucking thing
is gonna to start again.

29:00.146 --> 29:03.103
The therapy, the nightmares, everything.

29:03.103 --> 29:04.922
No, it isn't.

29:07.444 --> 29:09.992
It's nothing like last time.

29:13.587 --> 29:15.897
But something's going on.

29:17.559 --> 29:19.555
Something bad.

29:22.898 --> 29:25.992
I'm gonna find out what it is.

30:04.472 --> 30:06.339
Ready to play, Alex?

30:13.534 --> 30:17.512
I can smell your fear.

30:27.966 --> 30:31.245
I'm looking for a dock worker
named Etchison.

30:31.245 --> 30:33.713
- That's him over there.
- Is that him?

30:41.285 --> 30:43.309
Mr. Etchison?

30:43.309 --> 30:46.118
Sweetheart, you can call me
anything you like.

30:46.539 --> 30:49.184
Please. I don't have time for your games.

30:49.184 --> 30:50.552
Well that's a damn shame.

30:50.552 --> 30:51.840
'could be fun.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.822
Oaky. Let's talk about the opal.

30:55.874 --> 30:57.609
The jewel?

30:57.609 --> 30:59.697
I don't know what you're
talk'n about.

30:59.697 --> 31:03.378
That's odd. Your friend Clegg knew
exactly wat I was talking about.

31:03.378 --> 31:04.626
I don't know him either.

31:04.626 --> 31:05.927
I think you do.

31:06.152 --> 31:11.201
Middle aged guy, runs a pawn shop.
Ratted you out at the first snip of a lawsuit.

31:13.115 --> 31:15.419
Alright. What's the deal?

31:15.419 --> 31:16.576
Are you a cop?

31:16.576 --> 31:20.695
No. And we don't ever have to involve
them if you tell me where you got it.

31:23.898 --> 31:26.609
Out of that statue. After the accident.

31:26.609 --> 31:29.648
You must have seen it on the news.
It killed a guy.

31:29.648 --> 31:31.159
The Beaumont piece?

31:31.159 --> 31:32.441
How the hell should I know?

31:32.441 --> 31:35.377
There was some guy who had
bought it. Yeah.

31:38.565 --> 31:42.575
Hey. Like, give me a couple hndred.
Did I get fucked?

31:43.089 --> 31:45.378
Royally.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.621
Alexandra.
How nice to see you again.

32:51.299 --> 32:54.459
Mr. Beaumont, I am so sorry
about what happened.

32:54.459 --> 32:58.403
Yes. Irreplaceable.
One of a kind.

33:00.162 --> 33:03.403
We are talking about Ed Finney,
your assistant, right?

33:03.403 --> 33:06.691
Oh yes.
Yes of course.

33:08.971 --> 33:11.660
Well, if you are not too
broken up about him,

33:11.660 --> 33:14.145
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about the sculpture.

33:14.145 --> 33:16.269
Anything you wish.

33:16.972 --> 33:20.707
Well, the newspapers seem more concerned
with the details of the accident

33:20.707 --> 33:23.553
than a crane operator and such.
- That drunken swine.

33:23.753 --> 33:27.209
and less concerned about
the details of the statue itself.

33:27.932 --> 33:29.190
Was it bejeweled?

33:29.190 --> 33:31.138
No.
No, undecorated.

33:31.138 --> 33:32.585
A likeness of Ahura Mazda.

33:32.585 --> 33:36.293
One of the few to have been made
after the Islamic conversion.

33:37.138 --> 33:38.959
I tell you what. Here uh...

33:38.959 --> 33:41.437
Let me show you something.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.423
You'll be interested in this,
I think.

33:43.423 --> 33:46.374
Any new treasures at the auction house?

33:54.591 --> 33:55.637
Geez!

33:55.637 --> 33:57.314
Asshole!

33:57.314 --> 33:58.849
Gotcha.

34:15.483 --> 34:16.926
Wow.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.453
My room of t Lost Gods.

34:20.813 --> 34:24.775
Once worshipped, now...
...forgotten.

34:25.458 --> 34:28.253
Every culture of ancient history.

34:28.786 --> 34:30.760
See that?
Down there.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.501
That was the space reserved
for Ahura Mazda.

34:34.501 --> 34:38.449
Yes, what exactly is Ahura Mazda?

34:38.449 --> 34:41.368
It's the objects I collect. Alex.

34:41.368 --> 34:43.259
It's not theologies they represent.

34:44.052 --> 34:46.652
But for what it's worth,
he was a monotheistic diety

34:50.109 --> 34:51.744
So he was a god of good then.

34:51.744 --> 34:53.080
Certainly.

34:54.159 --> 34:59.661
Interestingly though, legend has
it that, uh, the opposing force

34:59.661 --> 35:02.535
if you will, is actually his own shadows.

35:02.535 --> 35:06.548
So, in a way, he himself was
the source of evil.

35:07.946 --> 35:10.994
There's someone at the University
I'd like to put you onto.

35:11.386 --> 35:15.192
A very smart woman. She has done some
catalog descriptions for me in the past.

35:15.192 --> 35:20.763
She could be of some help.
Provided you catch her in a good mood.

35:30.107 --> 35:32.413
Hey. Who's the teacher's pet, huh?

35:33.604 --> 35:35.515
Why the hell are you working
in the dark man?

35:38.449 --> 35:40.303
Wait a minute. Who are you?

35:44.183 --> 35:46.046
What the fuck?

35:48.761 --> 35:49.851
Oh my g...

35:50.041 --> 35:54.987
Am I to understand this is not
something you wish to see?

35:55.618 --> 35:56.904
Uh huh.

35:57.104 --> 35:59.401
Very well.

36:02.441 --> 36:05.061
My eyes!
My eyes!

36:06.726 --> 36:10.099
Oh my god.
I can't see.

36:10.609 --> 36:12.110
I can't see.

36:12.540 --> 36:14.366
You bastard!

36:15.629 --> 36:17.380
My eyes!

36:25.172 --> 36:26.363
My eyes.

36:31.117 --> 36:32.013
Alex.

36:34.447 --> 36:35.589
Alex!

36:36.075 --> 36:39.144
Alex! Raymond! What's the matter?

36:50.503 --> 36:51.649
Sorry.

36:52.692 --> 36:54.958
I don't know what happened.

36:55.194 --> 36:56.342
You fainted.

36:56.342 --> 36:59.837
Can I get you a drink or something?
Some water?

36:59.837 --> 37:01.558
No.

37:06.039 --> 37:07.063
No. I'm fine.

37:07.632 --> 37:10.351
I guess I'm just under a lot of stress,

37:11.474 --> 37:13.567
but I'm fine. Honestly.

37:13.567 --> 37:14.969
Honestly?

37:16.049 --> 37:19.700
I hope you'll be well enough
to attend my party.

37:20.690 --> 37:24.538
What it was, to celebrate my acquisition.

37:25.210 --> 37:28.599
Your boss, Mr. Merritt
received the invitations.

37:28.979 --> 37:32.104
You and your charming sister
should be most welcome.

37:33.705 --> 37:35.970
Well thank you. I'd like to,

37:36.872 --> 37:39.173
but I think I may be busy.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.522
...little more...

37:45.522 --> 37:47.851
Little more.
Hold on.

37:47.851 --> 37:52.079
- Ah. Back two feet.
- Okay professor.

37:52.079 --> 37:53.463
Good. Good.
That's good.

37:53.463 --> 37:55.999
I told the Dean's office that the
paperwork would be there tomorrow.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.169
I'm Busy.

37:57.369 --> 37:58.985
Okay. Good.

37:59.218 --> 38:01.267
I think you are mistaking
me for someone else.

38:01.891 --> 38:05.640
I'm Alex. Raymond Beaumont must
have called you, about me?

38:05.640 --> 38:08.707
Oh yeah. What an insufferable prick that man is.

38:08.707 --> 38:11.515
Still, it's not your problem.
Unless, of course, you're

38:11.715 --> 38:13.207
stupid enough to be working for him.

38:13.207 --> 38:14.145
No.

38:14.145 --> 38:14.981
Or sleeping with him?

38:14.981 --> 38:16.464
Eh-huh.
No.

38:16.464 --> 38:19.845
Oh good. Well that establishes your
discerning good taste.

38:19.845 --> 38:22.650
A little...uh...no, no no no no.
That's not gonna work.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.561
Up stage.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.330
Uh huh? What can I for you?

38:27.330 --> 38:30.552
Absolutely nothing at all, until I
can get your full attention.

38:32.202 --> 38:34.186
I like you.

38:34.567 --> 38:36.308
I'm just interfering here anyway.

38:36.308 --> 38:39.934
This is a, uh, co-production.
Folklore department. That's me.

38:39.934 --> 38:42.247
Drama department. That's not me.

38:42.247 --> 38:43.994
As soon as Professor Benson gets here

38:43.994 --> 38:46.717
I'm gonna be run off to him.

38:47.601 --> 38:51.038
The stone of the secret fire was first written
by the Empersia, around

38:51.038 --> 38:52.714
Around 900 years ago.

38:52.714 --> 38:57.291
A court sorcerer is said to have
imprisoned an evil spirit within it.

38:57.291 --> 38:58.615
An evil spirit?

38:58.615 --> 39:02.076
Yes. A creature from the
spaces between the worlds.

39:03.123 --> 39:04.541
A Djinn.

39:04.541 --> 39:06.084
A Djinn?

39:06.675 --> 39:07.543
A genie?

39:07.543 --> 39:12.146
Now hold on a minute. Froget what our
culture has made of the Djinn.

39:12.146 --> 39:13.512
Forget Barbars Eden.

39:13.512 --> 39:14.861
Forget Robin Williams.

39:15.203 --> 39:19.548
To the peoples of ancient Arabia,
the Djinn was not cute nor funny.

39:19.548 --> 39:21.875
It was something else entirely.

39:21.875 --> 39:24.176
It was the face of fear itself.

39:25.035 --> 39:26.577
How's it look?

39:29.414 --> 39:30.627
You tell me.

39:39.935 --> 39:41.483
Wow.

39:41.452 --> 39:43.049
I'm glad you approve.

39:45.202 --> 39:47.671
Um. You want to try something else?

39:47.671 --> 39:50.563
A different style maybe?
Tighter?

39:50.563 --> 39:53.905
Oh, no. Don't like feeling confined.

39:53.905 --> 39:55.528
I had enough of that.

39:56.074 --> 39:58.862
Okay then, follow me.

39:58.862 --> 39:58.862
With pleasure.

40:15.650 --> 40:18.494
Now, will this be cash or charge Mr....?

40:18.494 --> 40:21.206
Demerest.
Nathaniel Demerest

40:21.206 --> 40:22.740
Call Me Nathaniel.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.875
Okay Nathaniel.
Cash or charge?

40:25.875 --> 40:28.123
Which would you prefer?

40:29.914 --> 40:31.971
I don't know?
Cash?

40:31.971 --> 40:33.229
Done.

40:33.631 --> 40:34.745
Oh.

40:38.173 --> 40:41.895
This is my first day in your world.
Ariella

40:42.676 --> 40:45.366
I am pleased to see beauty as a constant.

40:45.828 --> 40:49.617
Does it bother you... knowing that
your beauty will fade?

40:50.286 --> 40:55.125
That your looking glass will day by day
tell you a long and unhappy story?

40:57.876 --> 41:04.327
Well. I mean... That's life. Right?
It happens to all of us.

41:04.327 --> 41:05.172
Like it or not.

41:05.172 --> 41:06.642
It doesn't have to, Ariella.

41:06.642 --> 41:07.973
Ask.

41:08.378 --> 41:10.982
Ask and see what happens.

41:10.982 --> 41:14.461
Ask for an end to change.
An end to decay.

41:14.461 --> 41:17.754
Say, "I wish to be beautiful forever."

41:19.987 --> 41:22.873
I wish to be beautiful forever.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.990
Pleasure doing business with you.

41:37.087 --> 41:40.697
Soon I will find you.

41:41.111 --> 41:44.020
...would you like to do this some other time?

41:45.230 --> 41:48.117
No.  I'm a... I'm...

41:48.117 --> 41:49.387
AH!

41:52.373 --> 41:54.959
I just wanted Professor Derleth
to check out my costume.

41:55.383 --> 41:57.141
Well obviously it's scary enough.

41:57.141 --> 41:58.890
Go back to rehearsal.

42:00.231 --> 42:01.848
Thanks.

42:03.634 --> 42:04.986
You alright?

42:06.094 --> 42:07.005
Yes.

42:07.005 --> 42:11.613
Okay. The Djinn, the word is both
plural and singular by the way,

42:11.613 --> 42:15.055
are a race created after the angels,
but before mankind.

42:15.055 --> 42:17.833
Powerful. Magical. Evil.

42:18.233 --> 42:19.832
Evil?

42:21.152 --> 42:24.293
I though that genies granted wishes.
That's what the myths say.

42:24.293 --> 42:29.610
They're obliged, but their true motivation is
always usurping this world for themselves.

42:29.810 --> 42:31.716
I never heard that.
What I heard was...

42:31.716 --> 42:32.923
A sweetened fable.

42:33.477 --> 42:36.485
Over the centuries, faith became fairytales.

42:36.485 --> 42:40.437
We avoided our terror by taming
it into fictions and inventing stories

42:40.437 --> 42:43.002
of magical lamps to rock our
children to sleep.

42:43.258 --> 42:45.163
And the old stories are darker.

42:45.163 --> 42:46.916
Much darker.

42:47.889 --> 42:51.497
In the old writings, the Djinn is everything
that we ever feared.

42:51.497 --> 42:55.937
An utterly inhuman race of beings,
that mean us harm.

42:56.477 --> 42:58.048
Older than our oldest history.

42:58.048 --> 43:00.564
More powerful than our worst imagining

43:00.564 --> 43:03.592
and driven by an ancient and endless malevolence.

43:19.650 --> 43:21.451
Detective Nathanson.

43:21.720 --> 43:22.636
Yeah?

43:22.636 --> 43:26.065
I was told downstairs you were in
charge of the Aickman investigation.

43:26.341 --> 43:27.574
I was.

43:31.231 --> 43:35.152
The case is closed. At least as far as
homicide is concerned.

43:35.152 --> 43:37.046
Unless you got something to tell me.

43:37.046 --> 43:39.893
Actually, I was hoping you
had something to tell me.

43:39.893 --> 43:43.220
Oh, really? And what would that be?

43:43.220 --> 43:45.160
Nothing much.
An address.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.089
A woman called Alexandra.

43:49.881 --> 43:52.178
What the hell makes you think
I can give you her address?

43:54.898 --> 43:57.451
What's your interest in this case anyway?

43:58.734 --> 44:00.891
Why do you keep looking over there?

44:00.891 --> 44:04.621
You see that guy?
Guilty as sin.

44:04.621 --> 44:07.310
Walked on 7 counts.
Walked each time.

44:07.310 --> 44:10.474
Made of teflon makes me sick.
You know what I would like?

44:10.474 --> 44:11.743
I'd love to know.

44:13.177 --> 44:16.178
Just once I'd like it to be easy.
I would like to nail that prick

44:16.178 --> 44:16.957
Dent to the rights.

44:16.957 --> 44:20.232
Murder One. Everybody's an eyewitness.

44:55.830 --> 44:59.023
Alexandra

44:59.335 --> 45:00.675
Hey! You!

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
{\an8}Top<font color="#ffff00">Teo</font>.com

45:46.788 --> 45:48.775
The stone of the secret fire

45:48.775 --> 45:52.706
created by a great Persian sorcerer
to save his people from the Djinn.

45:52.706 --> 45:54.715
is as much a curse as a blessing.

45:54.715 --> 45:57.473
because it is a doorway between the worlds.

45:57.473 --> 46:00.259
And like all doors, can be opened
from either side.

46:00.459 --> 46:04.728
Adjinn, once freed, can use the stone
to bring forth his race to our reality,

46:04.728 --> 46:06.678
and overwhelm humanity.

46:07.072 --> 46:10.598
But the Djinn must first charge the stone
by gathering the souls of humans

46:10.798 --> 46:12.543
who have had a single wish granted...

46:12.535 --> 46:15.692
He must then activate it,
by finding the human who woke him

46:15.692 --> 46:18.570
into this world, and granting
him 3 wishes.

46:18.687 --> 46:22.131
The sole limitation to the Djinn's
power is that it may only be

46:22.131 --> 46:23.960
used in the service of wishes.

46:35.892 --> 46:37.251
Sorry sir. We're closed.

46:37.251 --> 46:39.585
I am trying to locate an employee.

46:40.271 --> 46:42.763
- No on here. Just the boss.
- Alright, I'll talk to the boss.

46:42.763 --> 46:44.319
Open the doors please.

46:44.319 --> 46:46.777
It's appointments only
after business hours. Okay?

46:47.049 --> 46:48.877
You're becoming a bother little man.

46:49.343 --> 46:49.995
Open

46:50.401 --> 46:51.532
the doors.

46:56.266 --> 46:58.267
Okay pal. It is time for you to go.

47:01.212 --> 47:02.962
Get out of my way.

47:03.584 --> 47:05.275
I don't think so asshole.

47:06.444 --> 47:09.771
Do you have any idea how frustrating
it is to have unlimited power,

47:09.771 --> 47:13.487
and only be able to use it when some
worm asks you for something?

47:13.487 --> 47:17.186
No. I can't say that I do.
I can't say I give a shit either.

47:17.186 --> 47:18.897
Ask me for something.

47:18.897 --> 47:22.508
Okay.
I want you to leave.

47:26.167 --> 47:31.411
No. No.
I have to get inside.

47:31.411 --> 47:34.009
Well now, you's have to go through me.

47:35.536 --> 47:37.707
And that is something I would love to see.

48:10.125 --> 48:12.264
Who the hell are you?
How'd you get in here?

48:13.179 --> 48:15.264
The guard opened up on me.

48:15.994 --> 48:18.128
I wonder if I could ask your help.

48:20.895 --> 48:23.107
I'm looking for Alexandra Amberson.

48:23.107 --> 48:28.292
Ale.. Sh.. She, she was off today.
I asked you who you were.

48:28.292 --> 48:30.193
Someone she's expecting.

48:30.193 --> 48:32.786
Prehaps you'd be so kind as to
give me her home address.

48:33.944 --> 48:38.544
Wait a minute. If she knows you,
how come you don't have her address?

48:39.026 --> 48:42.160
I said she's expecting me.
I didn't say she knows me.

48:42.160 --> 48:46.692
Oh. Well in that case, um.
Maybe you better e-mail her,

48:46.692 --> 48:50.497
because I can't give you her address.
You understand.

48:50.497 --> 48:52.146
Perfectly.

48:52.834 --> 48:54.722
Would you happen to know
where she is right now?

48:54.722 --> 48:56.176
Yes. I would.

48:56.176 --> 48:59.514
- would you tell me?
- No. I wouldn't.

49:05.998 --> 49:08.384
Hey, hey!
That's a very valuable piece.

49:09.704 --> 49:11.112
Really?

49:11.989 --> 49:14.756
You would like it to be 100
times its valuable?

49:16.698 --> 49:19.069
Would I like it to be 100
times more valuable?

49:19.269 --> 49:20.466
Yes.

49:29.608 --> 49:31.257
Holy shit.

49:33.911 --> 49:35.459
What are you,
David Copperfield or something?

49:35.459 --> 49:36.433
How'd you do that?

49:36.433 --> 49:38.964
Old family secret.

49:39.413 --> 49:41.391
Where is Alexandra?

49:41.391 --> 49:49.143
Ahhh. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't
really feel, um, comfortable telling you.

49:49.319 --> 49:51.259
What would make you
comfortable Nick?

49:51.682 --> 49:53.172
Name it.

49:54.428 --> 49:55.262
What's my limit?

49:55.678 --> 49:57.043
Your imagination.

49:58.699 --> 50:02.611
Well, I am not a greedy man...
How about a million dollars?

50:05.037 --> 50:06.062
Done.

50:07.531 --> 50:09.267
Let's just see.

50:11.422 --> 50:14.534
Oh. Wait a minute. You forgotten
to fill in the beneficiary.

50:14.534 --> 50:17.769
Oh silly. It's my son Nick.

50:18.724 --> 50:22.094
He owns a very
prestigious auction house.

50:22.094 --> 50:26.349
There you go. Thanks for your business
Mrs. Merritt. Enjoy your flight.

50:33.635 --> 50:36.174
Hey. Yourself.

50:36.659 --> 50:37.903
What the hell are you doing?

50:38.119 --> 50:39.833
Learning the rules of the game.

50:40.204 --> 50:43.817
I leave work early to get you back
the car, and you're not even ready.

50:44.017 --> 50:45.282
Um Hm.

50:45.482 --> 50:47.533
Basketball?

50:47.533 --> 50:51.765
Damn.
I lost track of time.

50:51.765 --> 50:55.458
Okay. Just uh.
Just give me a second. Okay?

51:10.931 --> 51:15.255
Okay. That was great.
Come on everybody. Let's take a five.

51:17.107 --> 51:19.814
Stillness Miss Amberson.
That's how I did it.

51:20.014 --> 51:21.307
Stillness. Just like you said.

51:21.507 --> 51:23.752
Yes. Go
Go.

51:25.250 --> 51:27.342
Can I have your phone again?

51:27.544 --> 51:31.240
God. Who is this woman anyway?

51:39.640 --> 51:42.377
Damn, it's a machine.

51:44.124 --> 51:46.927
Professor Derleth, this is Alex.
Again.

51:46.927 --> 51:51.611
I really need to talk to you as
soon as possible. Please call me back.

51:52.181 --> 51:53.919
Thank you.

51:58.513 --> 52:00.061
Excuse me miss.

52:00.261 --> 52:02.214
Do you mind terribly if I borrow your phone?

52:02.849 --> 52:04.481
I'd be happy to pay for the call.

52:04.802 --> 52:06.021
That's Okay.

52:19.368 --> 52:22.402
Alright. That ought to keep
you from tripping. Go.

52:26.250 --> 52:27.397
Nobody home.

52:29.691 --> 52:32.181
Useful little items, arent they?

53:46.228 --> 53:50.388
I claim that, which is old.

53:54.926 --> 53:57.104
- Hello.
- Miss Amberson

53:57.104 --> 54:01.023
It's detective Nathanson.
We need to talk.

54:07.916 --> 54:11.575
There was a guy here looking for you.
I think...

55:32.065 --> 55:38.462
Only you can end their pain Alexandra.
Only you can free them.

55:46.246 --> 55:49.933
Patience, friends.

55:49.933 --> 55:53.653
Patience.

56:08.417 --> 56:11.623
Hi, Uh... Can I come in?

56:16.902 --> 56:21.491
The stone is charged. It's charged with
people's souls, fed with their fear.

56:21.983 --> 56:24.365
And the Djinn is after me.
I need to know what the hell to do.

56:24.365 --> 56:26.520
Alexandra, this is the 20th century.

56:26.520 --> 56:29.088
Don't you think all that sounds
a little unlikely?

56:29.088 --> 56:31.172
Would you like something to drink,
by the way?

56:34.481 --> 56:36.104
No.
Thank you.

56:36.104 --> 56:37.966
Well, I would.

56:38.800 --> 56:41.013
This is a nice cabinet, isn't it?

56:41.824 --> 56:43.959
Your boss would really like this.

56:43.959 --> 56:46.485
My boss? I never told you who I work for.

56:47.767 --> 56:49.123
You didn't?

56:52.564 --> 56:53.815
Then how would I know?

56:55.588 --> 56:57.048
Maybe Beaumont mentioned it?

56:57.567 --> 56:59.893
Oh, yeah!
He did.

57:03.304 --> 57:05.333
Let me explain.

57:05.333 --> 57:08.715
You are obviously looking for some piece
of magic. Some spell

57:08.715 --> 57:12.428
to get rid of this hypothetical Djinn
that you're talking about. right?

57:12.628 --> 57:14.324
Yes.

57:16.338 --> 57:18.847
They certainly existed.

57:19.047 --> 57:21.135
- You are cold?
- No, I'm fine.

57:21.343 --> 57:22.699
Would you like me to put the heat on?

57:23.012 --> 57:24.993
No. Just please continue.

57:25.419 --> 57:27.256
Alright...

57:27.456 --> 57:28.456
Where was I?

57:28.581 --> 57:32.638
Oh yeah! Spells, sorcerers.
Alexandra.

57:32.638 --> 57:36.967
You were born into an age of reason
and an age of science.

57:37.657 --> 57:40.008
All the sorcerers are dead

57:40.217 --> 57:44.135
and all the spells lost, to time.

57:44.335 --> 57:47.506
But the Djinn itself.
The Djinn, if it existed.

57:47.506 --> 57:50.484
Would be all there was.

57:50.926 --> 57:52.631
Imagine that.

57:52.831 --> 57:56.066
The only magical thing
in a rationalist world.

57:57.213 --> 58:00.446
A vulnerable world of disbelief.

58:00.967 --> 58:04.200
Where no reason would ever rescue you.

58:04.408 --> 58:06.702
Nor Science save you.

58:10.248 --> 58:12.959
He would have a fine old time.
Wouldn't he?

58:15.253 --> 58:16.532
This is no joke.

58:16.532 --> 58:19.251
No, it's not funny.

58:19.632 --> 58:21.243
Are you hungry?

58:22.865 --> 58:25.123
I'm not hungry. I'm not thirsty.
I'm not...

58:25.323 --> 58:28.396
Why do you keep trying
to do things for m...?

58:39.235 --> 58:40.591
I'm sorry.

58:41.529 --> 58:44.168
I guess I'm just a little tense.

58:49.976 --> 58:50.810
I guess.

58:52.895 --> 58:54.251
But I'm fine.

58:54.866 --> 58:56.321
Alright.

58:57.673 --> 58:59.104
Where were we?

58:59.104 --> 59:01.132
Oh, yes.

59:02.026 --> 59:03.830
No spells.

59:04.090 --> 59:05.626
No hope.

59:05.826 --> 59:08.641
If there's no hope. No magic.

59:10.622 --> 59:12.290
I'll have to rely on myself.

59:15.105 --> 59:18.129
Match wits with a creature older than time.

59:18.964 --> 59:22.300
Match wits with a prince
of the Dark Dominions.

59:23.239 --> 59:27.960
Pit your tiny 20th century brain
against one that walked

59:27.960 --> 59:30.482
the spaces between the worlds,

59:31.214 --> 59:35.229
and trod the wings of angels
beneath his concrete feet.

59:35.229 --> 59:42.828
Oh Alexandra, you're a delight.
Really. You are.

59:44.709 --> 59:45.553
I'm glad I can amuse you.

59:46.326 --> 59:50.740
Oh. I hurt your feelings.
I'm sorry.

59:50.740 --> 59:52.589
Let me make it up to you.

59:53.306 --> 59:54.729
What can I do?

59:56.711 --> 59:57.753
I must be going now.

01:00:01.507 --> 01:00:03.175
Sit down!

01:00:06.408 --> 01:00:07.763
Please.

01:00:08.285 --> 01:00:09.745
Sit down.

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:15.167
Where's Wendy?

01:00:15.375 --> 01:00:18.781
Bedroom.
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

01:00:19.234 --> 01:00:22.060
Messy.
I needed her face.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.404
You killed her?

01:00:23.613 --> 01:00:27.575
Actually, I can't kill anyone.
Not unless they wish me to.

01:00:28.201 --> 01:00:29.974
Your research should have told you that.

01:00:30.182 --> 01:00:32.128
She didn't wish to be dead

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:34.508
You lying sack of shit!

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:38.680
I showed her my true face.
Her reaction wasn't very flattering.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.528
As a matter of fact,
she got down right hysterical.

01:00:45.628 --> 01:00:50.075
I merely asked her if she if she wished
to be released from her fear.

01:00:52.497 --> 01:00:55.920
You're a dangerous person to know,
Alexandra.

01:00:56.972 --> 01:00:59.274
Your scientist friend. Your boss.

01:00:59.483 --> 01:01:01.464
The policemen. Wendy.

01:01:02.403 --> 01:01:03.990
By the bye.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.138
Where is that tasty little sister
of yours today?

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:12.133
If you harm Shannon

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.874
I kill to you.

01:01:15.437 --> 01:01:17.418
Spare me child.

01:01:17.939 --> 01:01:20.129
Behold my true face.

01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:21.424
Oh my god.

01:01:21.424 --> 01:01:25.656
Yes.
The shit just hit the fan. Didn't it?

01:01:26.177 --> 01:01:28.577
Let's get this over with, shall we?

01:01:28.777 --> 01:01:32.274
Make your wishes.

01:01:33.997 --> 01:01:36.380
Three wishes Alexandra.

01:01:36.813 --> 01:01:41.044
Doesn't that intrigue you?
Just a little?

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.382
Anything you want.

01:01:43.903 --> 01:01:46.315
- Anything?
- You ask for anything

01:01:46.315 --> 01:01:49.117
I must grant it.

01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:54.312
A trip to the moon.
A visit to Cairo Egypt.

01:01:54.512 --> 01:01:56.449
What happens if I wished you dead?

01:01:56.449 --> 01:01:59.127
Why, how remarkably original
Alexandra.

01:01:59.127 --> 01:02:03.820
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one free wish.

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:09.788
A sample. Get you into the
spirit of the game.

01:02:09.788 --> 01:02:13.308
Alright. I want you to destroy yourself.

01:02:13.517 --> 01:02:15.167
Blow your brains out.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.087
RIGHT NOW!

01:02:17.087 --> 01:02:18.809
Very well.

01:02:25.091 --> 01:02:28.220
That which is eternal cannot die.

01:02:28.637 --> 01:02:33.642
But if it's any consolation sweet Alex,
that hurt like hell.

01:02:34.564 --> 01:02:41.054
Now.
Make your three wishes.

01:02:42.401 --> 01:02:45.425
I always tell my girls
to know their opponent.

01:02:52.014 --> 01:02:53.582
So...

01:02:54.392 --> 01:02:56.373
I think I will, make a wish.

01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:58.600
Good.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.127
I wish...

01:03:02.004 --> 01:03:04.298
to know what you are.

01:03:07.843 --> 01:03:09.407
What are doing?

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.176
Granting your wish.

01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:28.910
You wish to know what I am.

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:31.618
To you, I am this.

01:03:32.331 --> 01:03:35.555
The cry of the abandoned child.

01:03:35.822 --> 01:03:38.219
The winter of the whipped beast

01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:42.865
I am the face that stares back
at you from the shadow

01:03:42.865 --> 01:03:44.804
do you mirrror?

01:03:45.245 --> 01:03:47.882
The hollowness, at the heart of all

01:03:47.882 --> 01:03:50.283
your hopes, Alexandra.

01:03:51.013 --> 01:03:56.175
I am despair.

01:04:11.839 --> 01:04:13.170
Shit.

01:04:14.578 --> 01:04:18.691
'careful what you wish for.

01:04:59.207 --> 01:05:03.389
So. How do you like me so far?

01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:06.549
I didn't wish for this.
You're supposed to be outside.

01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:07.994
You're not supposed to be here.

01:05:08.235 --> 01:05:10.910
I am bound by that which I bind.

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:14.451
Contained and by that which I contain.

01:05:14.451 --> 01:05:16.305
This isn't what I wanted.

01:05:16.305 --> 01:05:21.223
Well then. Word your
wishes more carefully.

01:05:27.572 --> 01:05:32.402
Oh Alexandra. You left
your sister all alone.

01:05:32.402 --> 01:05:36.433
Not to worry. I'll find her and
keep her company.

01:05:36.537 --> 01:05:38.125
Don't you go near her.

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.589
I mighr have to.

01:05:39.594 --> 01:05:44.438
You know how persuasive the
pain of loved ones can be.

01:05:45.031 --> 01:05:45.638
No.

01:05:52.178 --> 01:05:55.619
Stop me then.
Wish yourself back.

01:05:56.036 --> 01:06:00.332
I wish I was in my apartment.
Right now. Without you.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.738
Shannon?

01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:16.121
Shannon, where are you?
We got to get out of here.

01:06:23.102 --> 01:06:26.288
Alex. Waited as long as I could.
Gone to Beaumont's party.

01:06:26.288 --> 01:06:27.938
Join us if you can!
Shannon.

01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:34.728
Two wishes in. We're so connected now.

01:06:34.828 --> 01:06:39.992
Wherever you go, there I'll be.
Wherever you are, I will find you.

01:06:41.082 --> 01:06:42.542
FUCK YOU!

01:07:09.966 --> 01:07:12.500
Going my way?

01:07:44.689 --> 01:07:47.383
Excuse me ma'am. Ah..
Is your name on the list?

01:07:47.383 --> 01:07:50.676
You have got to help me.
This guy is crazy. He's dangerous.

01:07:50.676 --> 01:07:52.854
He broke my window.
He is trying to kill me.

01:08:04.292 --> 01:08:08.958
Excuse me sir.
Is Mr. Beaumont expecting you?

01:08:09.923 --> 01:08:12.530
I asked you a question.
Sir.

01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:16.075
Am I expected? Yes.

01:08:16.283 --> 01:08:18.473
I wouldn't be here, if it weren't
for Mr. Beaumont.

01:08:18.682 --> 01:08:20.497
Well that sounds good.

01:08:21.243 --> 01:08:23.376
But it doesn't sound like an invitation.

01:08:23.376 --> 01:08:26.685
I don't care what it sounds like.
Step aside.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.978
Let me make this real simple for you.

01:08:28.978 --> 01:08:32.446
If your name isn't on the list,
you don't get in.

01:08:34.426 --> 01:08:36.200
I've dealt with your type before.

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:39.953
Mister, you've never even
met my type before.

01:08:40.267 --> 01:08:44.125
I am going through that door,
and you will not to stop me.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:46.895
Is that perfectly clear,
doorman?

01:08:46.895 --> 01:08:49.964
Doorman? The name is Valentine.

01:08:50.068 --> 01:08:52.258
Johnny Valentine.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.343
You remember that when they ask

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:56.220
how you lost your eye.

01:08:56.325 --> 01:08:58.514
Forgive my brassness.

01:08:58.723 --> 01:09:03.425
My eagerness for the end game has skewed
my judgement. I'll make you a deal.

01:09:03.425 --> 01:09:05.367
I don't make deals.

01:09:05.367 --> 01:09:06.960
What else do you have to do?

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:11.745
Tonight.
Keep assholes out of parties.

01:09:11.745 --> 01:09:13.843
And what about tomorrow?

01:09:14.051 --> 01:09:16.747
Surely you are not telling
me this is all you can do.

01:09:18.118 --> 01:09:20.287
Nor all you ever have done.

01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:23.540
It certainly isn't all you ever wished for.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:29.066
Tell me the truth. Don't you grow weary
of this job, day in and day out?

01:09:29.692 --> 01:09:33.073
Wouldn't you like to escape to
a more exciting profession?

01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:35.867
What the FUCK does that have
to do with you?

01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:37.304
Everything.

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:41.578
Take the chance Johnny.
Answer the question.

01:09:41.892 --> 01:09:45.520
Would you like to escape?

01:09:48.826 --> 01:09:50.380
Yeah.

01:09:50.964 --> 01:09:53.260
As you wish.

01:09:59.097 --> 01:10:01.704
Houdini did it in two and a half minutes.

01:10:20.544 --> 01:10:22.302
Excuse me.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:29.933
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:10:34.158 --> 01:10:35.178
Shannon?

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:37.587
Sorry.

01:10:49.085 --> 01:10:50.854
Alex, I didn't know you were com...
What are you doing?

01:10:50.854 --> 01:10:52.677
I'm trying to get you outta here.
Come on. We gotta go.

01:10:52.677 --> 01:10:53.701
Get the hell off of me.

01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:55.361
Shannon. We have got to leave now.

01:10:55.361 --> 01:10:56.428
Trust me.

01:10:56.428 --> 01:11:00.618
No. Trust me. you obviously haven't
seen Beaumont's new friend.

01:11:00.827 --> 01:11:03.167
You remember the guy from
the basketball court?

01:11:09.475 --> 01:11:11.502
Shannon.
Shannon!

01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:14.460
...and I was at Cindy's party, of course,
the one where they served the

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:18.289
divorce papers in the middle of dinner.
It was hysterical.

01:11:18.289 --> 01:11:19.815
People talked about it for a year.

01:11:19.815 --> 01:11:20.847
Really?

01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:26.504
I remember a certain potentate date, whose
last party was talked about for centuries.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.695
What do you mean, it went down in history?

01:11:29.895 --> 01:11:30.895
Yes.

01:11:31.275 --> 01:11:34.650
God, how I'd love to
host a party like that.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.928
Shannon!

01:11:41.639 --> 01:11:43.058
As you wish.

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:48.839
Ted, you can see right through me.

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:48.437
My God.

01:12:48.645 --> 01:12:51.148
Not yet, human.

01:12:51.357 --> 01:12:55.319
Soon. Very soon I will be...

01:13:07.894 --> 01:13:09.694
Shannon?

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.836
Shannon!

01:13:31.102 --> 01:13:33.652
Perimeter! Everybody get to the house now!

01:13:33.652 --> 01:13:34.944
Shannon!

01:14:13.108 --> 01:14:17.039
We have unfinished business.

01:14:17.039 --> 01:14:18.216
It's going to stay unfinished.

01:14:20.014 --> 01:14:23.013
Listen to their screams child.

01:14:23.828 --> 01:14:28.226
Listen to their music of their agony.

01:14:29.612 --> 01:14:30.520
You Bastard!

01:14:30.848 --> 01:14:34.066
You can save them, Alexandra.

01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:37.820
Just wish it away.

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:41.370
No. I won't.
I can't.

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:45.230
My patience wears thin.

01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:52.939
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

01:14:53.466 --> 01:14:55.025
Where's your third wish then?

01:14:55.736 --> 01:14:58.674
I don't need you dead Alexandra.

01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:02.219
I just need you to wish you were a...

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
{\an8}Top<font color="#ffff00">Teo</font>.com

01:15:12.214 --> 01:15:15.971
Run...
...Run

01:15:29.216 --> 01:15:31.943
- Raymond.
- Alex. Alex, what is going on here?

01:15:31.943 --> 01:15:34.919
Shannon.
Raymond. Have you seen Shannon?

01:15:34.919 --> 01:15:38.108
Raymond. Raymond?

01:15:38.308 --> 01:15:39.659
Gosh, Raymond?

01:16:53.059 --> 01:16:56.162
Hey miss. Come with us.
We're trying to get this under control.

01:16:56.162 --> 01:16:58.590
Get out of here.
Get OUT!

01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:59.786
He's coming!

01:18:04.385 --> 01:18:07.710
Please. We have got to go!
We have got to...

01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:10.486
it's not going to do any good!

01:18:33.349 --> 01:18:35.648
Shannon!

01:19:02.569 --> 01:19:06.330
No more doors.
No more rooms.

01:19:06.706 --> 01:19:09.256
No more excuses.

01:19:09.456 --> 01:19:11.853
Make your wish.

01:19:12.053 --> 01:19:12.997
I will not wish.

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:15.186
Really?

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:20.713
Not even when I show you the
latest addition to Beaumont's collection.

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.451
The final flowering of his wish.

01:19:24.451 --> 01:19:24.624
What?

01:19:24.884 --> 01:19:27.282
A little masterpiece of my own.

01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:30.306
I call it "SISTER".

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:33.976
"WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.431
Oh god.

01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:38.675
Shannon!

01:19:38.675 --> 01:19:41.220
Rather a good likeness,
don't you think?

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.149
I especially relish...

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:46.364
the 'trapped-animal' look in the eyes.

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:50.002
You vicious son of a BITCH!

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:52.036
You don't approve?

01:19:52.578 --> 01:19:53.884
Alright then.

01:19:53.884 --> 01:19:54.936
FUCK IT!

01:19:55.019 --> 01:19:56.791
You know what I say?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.314
If you can't beat them,
burn them baby.

01:20:11.493 --> 01:20:12.473
Oh no.

01:20:13.028 --> 01:20:14.751
Shannon!

01:20:14.751 --> 01:20:16.678
Remind you of something?

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.984
Make your wish.

01:20:34.384 --> 01:20:37.953
I suggest you do it quickly, dear.

01:20:45.484 --> 01:20:47.310
Oh god.

01:20:57.496 --> 01:20:59.273
Stillness...

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.141
I wish...

01:21:09.341 --> 01:21:11.015
Yes?

01:21:20.507 --> 01:21:20.940
I wish...

01:21:21.565 --> 01:21:22.504
Wish on, child.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:24.671
Stillness...

01:21:31.926 --> 01:21:36.621
I wish Mickey Torelli hadn't been
drinking on the job, 2 days ago.

01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:44.442
No.

01:21:48.756 --> 01:21:50.439
No.

01:21:57.866 --> 01:22:01.023
No.
Impossible.

01:22:01.877 --> 01:22:03.796
Not by...

01:22:05.206 --> 01:22:06.870
you!

01:22:40.603 --> 01:22:42.496
You should never met me.

01:23:03.423 --> 01:23:05.417
I'm surprised you are here in
person Mr. Beaumont.

01:23:05.417 --> 01:23:07.611
The works, completely in order.

01:23:08.103 --> 01:23:10.323
I've waited 10 years for this piece.

01:23:10.846 --> 01:23:12.408
Hey Mickey, watch it!

01:23:12.398 --> 01:23:14.523
Look! What do you think that is?
Coconuts?

01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:18.127
That's a... That.
Pre-Islamic stuff you got in there!

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:19.186
Now slowly. Thanks!

01:23:19.993 --> 01:23:21.695
Okay! Got it!

01:23:40.455 --> 01:23:44.640
Oh yeah. This will make some
very nice engagement gift.

01:23:46.505 --> 01:23:49.591
- Very at least a nice engagement gift.
- Yeah.

01:23:53.505 --> 01:23:54.481
Hi Nick.

01:23:54.481 --> 01:23:56.460
- You're late.
- Sorry.

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:58.339
I'll give you 2000 for them.

01:24:00.231 --> 01:24:01.990
So, what are we doing tonight?

01:24:04.232 --> 01:24:05.053
"We"?

01:24:05.053 --> 01:24:08.693
Ohhh, what's the matter Josh?

01:24:08.893 --> 01:24:10.905
Are you afraid of the complications?

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.136
You know what?

01:24:15.033 --> 01:24:16.611
I think this could help.

01:24:17.545 --> 01:24:18.978
Does that help?

01:24:25.893 --> 01:24:27.946
Yeah.

01:24:28.645 --> 01:24:32.285
Yeah, where uh...
Where are we going tonight?

01:24:33.628 --> 01:24:35.097
Dinner and a movie.

01:24:36.116 --> 01:24:37.391
With me?

01:24:37.591 --> 01:24:38.591
Yeah.

01:24:43.818 --> 01:24:45.890
I was thinking more about, um...

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:49.345
...about hotdogs and a ball game.

01:24:54.511 --> 01:24:56.218
Yeah.

01:24:58.557 --> 01:25:01.915
Um... Are you...
Are you alright?

01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:05.125
