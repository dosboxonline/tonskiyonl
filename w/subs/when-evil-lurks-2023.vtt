WEBVTT

01:11.530 --> 01:12.615
Did you hear?

01:16.911 --> 01:18.454
Is that our land?

01:18.871 --> 01:20.498
No, it's in the forest.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.627
Maybe Ruiz?

01:26.712 --> 01:27.713
Or some poacher?

01:27.713 --> 01:30.257
No, a poacher
doesn't shoot so much.

01:35.471 --> 01:38.224
- Should we take the dogs?
- No, they'll see us.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.351
I counted three.

01:41.519 --> 01:43.771
Then it stopped.
And two more.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.398
They are not hunting.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.235
It's not a rifle.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.904
It's a revolver.

01:57.910 --> 01:58.911
Get a coat.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.343
Was it here or at Ruiz's?

02:14.343 --> 02:15.761
It was near.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.283
We'll leave at dawn.

02:42.997 --> 02:46.292
WHEN EVIL LURKS

04:14.004 --> 04:15.130
Shit.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.477
A puma?

04:30.020 --> 04:32.398
There was a big one
stalking around.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.819
It ate Ruiz's goats.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.534
Isn't this Ruiz?

04:44.410 --> 04:46.078
He was hunting the puma.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.081
He lost to the cat.

04:49.707 --> 04:50.791
No.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.086
This guy was cut
with something sharp.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.678
What do we do?

05:03.053 --> 05:04.138
We have to report it.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.780
These are pieces of something.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.954
I've seen this somewhere.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.498
What is it for?

05:35.169 --> 05:36.462
I don't know, brother.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.967
We are at Ruiz's now.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.636
We have to tell him.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.514
Or the police?

05:49.933 --> 05:51.685
What if the killer is Ruiz?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.812
He caught him stealing
and killed him.

05:54.229 --> 05:58.484
Ruiz wouldn't cut
someone in half, shut up.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.945
He cuts him up,
making him disappear,

06:01.945 --> 06:04.573
feeding him to the pigs...
- What happened with Ruiz?

06:04.573 --> 06:05.574
Why?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.702
Did something happen with Ruiz
that you are not telling me?

06:10.954 --> 06:12.164
He doesn't like us.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.666
He doesn't like you!

06:27.096 --> 06:28.680
He was going...

06:29.014 --> 06:30.599
or coming.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.645
He was taking a shortcut
to the hill.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.022
To Maria Elena's house.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.024
Was he a relative?

06:41.026 --> 06:42.194
What's this language?

06:43.695 --> 06:44.988
I've seen this.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.533
- Russian maybe?
- Russian?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.953
Look, Maria Elena Gomez.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.107
What's going on
with these dogs?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.609
Hi, Maria Elena.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.570
How are you?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.071
Long time no see.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.615
We are here

07:28.615 --> 07:31.118
about last night's gun shots,
did you hear them?

07:31.577 --> 07:34.079
We looked around
with Jimmy and the dogs,

07:34.913 --> 07:35.914
nearby.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.834
We found someone
you may know.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.129
Were you waiting for someone?

07:44.631 --> 07:45.799
Because he...

07:46.091 --> 07:47.176
he won't make it.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.261
He had a problem.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.804
When will he arrive?

07:50.804 --> 07:54.099
He must have arrived
long ago.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.852
We are waiting for him.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.271
For him to deal
with my son.

08:00.105 --> 08:00.981
Uriel?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.107
Yes.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.736
He has to kill my son.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.865
He has to kill Uriel.

08:42.940 --> 08:43.857
He is possessed,

08:43.857 --> 08:46.777
he's been rotten
for a long time.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.989
We were waiting for them
to dispose of him.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.325
It's my fault.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.286
I thought that by praying

08:57.287 --> 08:59.039
we would be able to heal him.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.334
We lit a candle
to the Saint-

09:02.334 --> 09:04.253
Churches are dead, ma'am.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.214
Dead.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.133
We were afraid of speaking.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.220
Afraid of getting kicked off the
land by Ruiz and the neighbors.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.763
We have nothing.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.932
We have no place to go.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.144
We thought we could heal him.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.231
We took care of him
so he didn't die.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.775
So they can kill him.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.903
But it's taking too long.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.281
Have you reported this?

09:32.906 --> 09:35.075
A year ago, or more.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.285
A year?

09:38.036 --> 09:39.246
Who did you tell?

10:11.737 --> 10:12.946
The lady's son?

10:13.739 --> 10:14.948
Yes, the older one.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.744
She didn't speak to me.
And to you, Superintendent?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.789
Did you see him?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.501
Well.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.755
What did you see?

10:29.755 --> 10:31.048
Tell me.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.133
Have you ever seen
a rotten before?

10:33.925 --> 10:34.801
So?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.137
How do you know?

10:38.221 --> 10:40.057
As they say, Gutierrez,

10:40.766 --> 10:42.351
when you see one,
you know it.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.353
And we knew it, easy.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.022
You are under the influence.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.733
Many cases of possessed ones
are fake.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.443
And we are here,
in the middle of nowhere-

10:51.443 --> 10:53.111
Uriel is dying!

10:53.111 --> 10:55.113
He is swollen,
he is a ball of pus.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.948
Bring the Mayor.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.116
Give me the phone.

10:58.950 --> 10:59.910
Call him.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.454
Give me the number,
I'll do it, no problem.

11:02.913 --> 11:03.872
He must face this.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.415
Nobody tells me what to do.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.542
Especially you, Yazurlo.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.044
Especially you.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.712
It took a year.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.715
A whole year passed and you only
sent the cleaner yesterday.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.425
Don't raise your voice.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.136
Nobody spoke to me about this.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.431
You'll have a hard time, again.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.268
You don't believe me,
do you?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.853
Leave him.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.730
Give me an excuse
to lock you up.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.358
You won't get out
easily, lunatic.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.901
Easy, brother.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.320
We found the cleaner dead.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.532
We found him in pieces,
don't you get it?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.325
There's a protocol
for cases like this.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.414
We call, Public Health comes
and they solve it.

11:45.997 --> 11:46.832
Done.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.126
That's what we'll do.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.253
Do as you like.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.048
Why was the cleaner killed?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.426
Who?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.302
Ruiz killed him?

12:00.345 --> 12:01.304
Ruiz?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.516
I doubt everything.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.935
We are at the end
of the world.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
Why would there be
a possessed one here?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.064
What are you saying?

12:13.525 --> 12:15.235
They won't come
and see the body.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.447
Not even the rotten,
they told me.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.200
They said
it's not their problem.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.494
They washed their hands.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.081
But someone killed him, Ruiz.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.375
Someone trying to prevent
the cleaner

12:30.375 --> 12:31.918
from reaching Maria's place.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.380
And the Mayor?

12:35.922 --> 12:37.048
They called him.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.217
He knew, a year ago.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.511
He just let it pass.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.806
He said he thought
it was already solved.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.391
They asked us not to speak,

12:46.391 --> 12:49.352
or we'll be marked and
this place will be worthless.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.146
A ghost town, Ruiz.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.397
We lose everything.

12:52.397 --> 12:56.276
They suggested we leave until
they send a new cleaner from...

12:57.110 --> 12:58.111
the Ministry.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.196
When?

12:59.988 --> 13:01.156
They didn't say.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.283
There's no time,
Uriel is about to die,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.035
we can't wait for a cleaner.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.874
Leave,

13:11.500 --> 13:12.918
close our mouths

13:13.335 --> 13:14.336
and leave.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.171
We'll have to arm ourselves.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.339
Arm ourselves?

13:17.923 --> 13:19.257
Against what?

13:23.178 --> 13:24.679
My dogs left a month ago.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.265
The four of them.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.148
First they make
the animals go crazy, they say.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.278
Then they even make
the deceased crazy.

13:42.531 --> 13:43.532
What shall we do?

13:43.532 --> 13:46.034
Something, we have
to do something.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.620
Maybe we have
to auction everything off.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.289
Leave before this goes viral.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.333
The naive brothers.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.420
This was a set up.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.922
It was the State.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.549
They want my land.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.969
That's why they abandon us,
they don't care about us.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.097
A possessed one here.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.642
I never imagined this.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.198
Armando, where are you going?

14:26.116 --> 14:27.659
Don't do something stupid.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.429
Holy Mary!

14:47.429 --> 14:48.597
Mr. Ruiz.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.057
God, what are you doing?

14:51.516 --> 14:53.018
What are you doing?

14:56.187 --> 14:57.564
Motherfuckers...

14:59.190 --> 15:00.358
No,

15:02.027 --> 15:03.528
look what they brought.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.282
They brought the foulest thing
to my land.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.450
Don't shoot.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.619
Mr. Ruiz,
don't shoot, please.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.579
I have to do it.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.041
You don't kill evil like that,
it will be worse.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.043
If you kill him, you die.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.589
It will take our bodies,
it will take our souls.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.301
Don't do it, please,
it will make it worse.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.469
Worse.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.013
It has to be done
by a professional.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.140
Shut up, fucker.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.644
I should have
burned your house down

15:35.644 --> 15:38.396
when you came here,
with your filth.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.315
You contaminate everything.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.650
Everything.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.068
Motherfuckers.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.778
Motherfuckers.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.198
Kill me, Ruiz.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.659
Please,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.787
you coward, kill me.

15:56.581 --> 16:00.585
Before I move
to Jimena's belly,

16:01.711 --> 16:04.839
and posses the life
growing inside of her.

16:06.841 --> 16:10.345
You'll be the first
I will visit

16:11.179 --> 16:13.473
when I'm released.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.630
Armando.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.300
What have you done?
Tell me you didn't hurt anybody.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.553
He's playing, that's all.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.723
He can do what he wants,
He plays with us.

16:54.723 --> 16:55.765
Open the window.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.475
He taunts us.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.601
Armando.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.187
He is alive,
he didn't do it.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.732
You have to leave.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.650
We are thinking about leaving.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.402
Fuck everything, Ruiz.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.863
No, he has to go.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.824
We have to take him away.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.368
Two or three hours from here.
As far as we can.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.164
- It's too risky.
- Risky is having him here.

17:19.164 --> 17:22.584
- We don't know how to do it.
- Cowards.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.712
I'll do it with you,

17:26.921 --> 17:28.464
or I'll do it myself.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.385
This is my land.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.849
The rotten must be removed
before it rots the rest.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.812
You have a family, Pedro.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.147
Don't you?

17:44.689 --> 17:46.274
Do it for them.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.194
Take the risk.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.739
What are you doing?

17:52.739 --> 17:53.823
Mr. Ruiz.

17:54.532 --> 17:55.909
Don't harm him.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.536
What are you doing?
Don't harm him.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.580
He's too big,
he won't pass.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.332
I'm not touching him.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.418
Bring a rope, we tie his feet
and drag him like a pig.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.711
What are you doing?

18:07.545 --> 18:08.588
Taking him away.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.882
Take him away?
Where?

18:13.718 --> 18:15.136
They are taking your brother.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.180
Go grab a rope
or a strap to tie him.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.307
A rope? Let's lift him
using the sheets.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.850
Grab the sheets.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.644
- They will break.
- They won't.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.480
He is right, hold his feet
and let's lift him.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.648
At the same time.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.774
Together.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.901
One, two, three, now.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.986
Come on, together.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.657
Harder, harder.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.200
Wait, look.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.368
Look!

18:42.497 --> 18:44.457
Nasty fucker.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.459
You are killing him.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.628
Get out, you brat,
or I'll kill you.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.589
Grab it, pull.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.341
Here, pull.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.635
Come on, come on, pull.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.595
It's stuck.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.514
It's full of shit.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.266
Don't touch him!

19:01.266 --> 19:02.934
Let's pull together.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.978
Grab it.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.230
Be careful with the steps.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.731
Careful.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.650
Pull, shit.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.944
There, at the same time.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.946
Together.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.699
I'm tired, he's falling.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.451
Harder, hold it there.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.537
He's falling.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.706
Grab it, fuck you!

19:25.373 --> 19:26.666
We need a blanket.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.626
Go fetch a blanket.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.378
Hurry up, asshole.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.465
One, two, three.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.923
Shall we throw him
here or farther?

20:15.715 --> 20:16.799
How far are we?

20:16.799 --> 20:18.509
Three hundred kilometers.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.512
Let's go farther,

20:21.804 --> 20:23.389
a hundred more maybe.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.808
Let's check him
and drive another hundred.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.230
What a smell, damn it.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.441
- Did you touch him?
- No, no.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.402
We have to burn the clothes.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.116
We did alright.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.454
You did well.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.457
This was the right thing to do.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.292
Careful. Careful!

20:51.292 --> 20:52.710
Damn.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.713
Did you hit him?
- No, I didn't

20:55.713 --> 20:57.548
where did the brat come from?

20:57.548 --> 20:59.467
The asshole
was going to school.

21:00.551 --> 21:01.886
Asshole!

21:02.679 --> 21:04.889
Motherfucker,
just what we needed.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.849
So dangerous.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.559
God damn it!

21:24.575 --> 21:26.035
Shall we drop him here?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.412
Yes.

21:27.662 --> 21:28.913
And if he drowns?

21:28.913 --> 21:30.164
It's kind of dry.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.002
Damn it!

21:34.419 --> 21:35.420
What happened?

21:38.548 --> 21:39.507
Did he jump?

21:39.507 --> 21:40.883
He can't move.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.303
No, it happened
when we swerved,

21:44.303 --> 21:45.930
when he almost hit the kid.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.516
I asked you
to watch him, Jimmy.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.434
I didn't see it.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.935
How did you not see that?

21:50.935 --> 21:52.353
I didn't.

21:52.353 --> 21:54.731
I saw that we almost
killed a kid.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.694
How long since the kid?

22:00.945 --> 22:01.738
Twenty minutes.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.614
- Sure?
- More or less.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.576
It's back there.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.202
Shall we load him again?

22:10.204 --> 22:11.539
It's over.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.125
It is far enough.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.544
It's not our fucking problem.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.692
Armando.

25:27.818 --> 25:28.986
Armando.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.280
Armando.

25:34.742 --> 25:35.993
That goat.

25:44.794 --> 25:45.753
You.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.635
No.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.178
No.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.085
Leave, motherfucker.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.837
Armando.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.047
Don't do it, wait.

26:33.801 --> 26:37.430
don't shoot the beast
with a firearm.

26:37.972 --> 26:40.474
You'll condemn us, love.

26:40.766 --> 26:44.312
We will be parents,
don't do it, please.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.397
Get out!

26:54.363 --> 26:56.741
Leave, fucker.

26:57.241 --> 26:58.451
Leave.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.967
I went to Ruiz's.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.177
He was dead.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.179
And his wife, too.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.056
My mother disappeared.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.308
What do you mean?
Where is she?

28:47.017 --> 28:48.894
Something happened,

28:48.894 --> 28:51.355
you did the wrong thing
by taking Uriel away.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.315
Did you see Ruiz dead?

28:56.861 --> 28:59.864
Let me stay here,
I don't want to go back alone.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.491
You can't stay, leave.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.535
Please, I'm freezing to death.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.537
Please, Mr. Yazurlo.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.000
Stay in the saddle room,

29:11.584 --> 29:13.335
you'll find something
to stay warm.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.046
I don't want him to stay.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.048
You leave at dawn.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.010
He is armed,
you know that?

29:21.010 --> 29:22.219
Are you armed?

29:22.219 --> 29:24.513
Yes, Sir,
I have a .38.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.182
Give it to him.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.896
You leave as soon
as the sun comes out.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.023
You never come back.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.233
Yes, Sir.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.076
I must tell you something.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.913
Don't use electric lights.

29:50.915 --> 29:52.917
Its shadows call in the evil.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.922
Why did you let him stay?

29:59.006 --> 30:00.966
- He is scared, Jimmy.
- Don't say.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.594
Do you believe him?

30:04.094 --> 30:05.471
His mother won't abandon him.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.389
Why would she?

30:08.098 --> 30:09.391
He is lying.

30:18.609 --> 30:19.944
Five.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.490
We won't take anything
from the house.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.160
Valuables?

30:29.286 --> 30:30.454
No.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.250
Nothing that was here,

30:34.250 --> 30:35.501
in this place.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.004
No clothes,

30:40.297 --> 30:41.590
no memories.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.470
We go to town,

30:48.222 --> 30:49.515
I pick up my kids,

30:51.058 --> 30:52.268
and we get out of here.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.057
Open up.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.685
It's me, Pedro,
we have to talk.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.023
What's going on, Pedro?

31:39.023 --> 31:41.275
We have to talk,
let me in.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.947
Does Sabrina know?
She hasn't said anything.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.407
I need to talk,
let me in.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.450
Wait.

31:49.450 --> 31:50.618
You can't enter.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.202
Wait what?

31:52.202 --> 31:54.079
Come on, let me into my house.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.539
What are you doing?

31:56.332 --> 31:58.792
Wake up Sabrina
and the kids, too.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.253
Bring two changes of clothes,
for me and my brother,

32:01.253 --> 32:02.588
I'll explain.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.219
What are you doing?
What the fuck?

32:10.763 --> 32:12.056
Listen,

32:12.056 --> 32:14.308
if you are in trouble
don't involve my family.

32:14.308 --> 32:17.353
Bring the clothes,
it's for everyone's sake.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.063
Bring them, hurry.

32:24.526 --> 32:25.819
What the fuck?

32:33.077 --> 32:35.037
Sabrina, we need to talk.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.330
Is he drunk?

32:36.330 --> 32:37.790
I don't know,
you can see for yourself.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.418
Why are you doing naked?

32:41.669 --> 32:43.712
Leave immediately.

32:44.254 --> 32:45.172
We need to talk.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.757
Why are you in my house?

32:46.757 --> 32:48.092
Leave.

32:48.092 --> 32:49.551
What's this?

32:49.551 --> 32:51.762
We need to talk,
things are happening.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.472
You are insane.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.848
There will be a disaster.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.601
You can't be here,
leave immediately.

32:57.601 --> 32:58.769
Do you hear me?

32:58.769 --> 33:00.020
Leave!

33:00.020 --> 33:01.397
I need clothes.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.739
Fuck.

33:11.115 --> 33:12.199
Alcohol?

33:13.325 --> 33:14.410
Give me that.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.080
- Don't look at me like that.
- You are insane.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.498
I'll explain.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.215
Let's go inside.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.550
No, you are not coming in.

33:29.550 --> 33:32.344
You're violating the restraining
order, are you aware of that?

33:32.344 --> 33:33.345
What's this?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.514
You woke up Jair.

33:36.140 --> 33:36.807
What's this madness.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.393
Leonardo, let's go inside
and I'll explain.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.146
Dad.

33:42.688 --> 33:43.731
Coquito.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.483
Santino,
go inside, it's cold.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.152
Yes, let's go inside.

33:50.154 --> 33:53.407
Do something,
take him away.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.744
Coquito, prepare a bag
with clothes, toys,

33:56.744 --> 33:59.371
and something warm,
we'll hit the road.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.582
What? Santino
isn't going anywhere.

34:01.582 --> 34:03.542
You are the one leaving.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.836
We all will leave.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.422
There's a rotten
in the town.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.926
A possessed one, Sabrina.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.719
I think it is free.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.931
This town will turn
into hell quickly.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.768
Shall I call the lawyer?

34:20.768 --> 34:23.228
Call the police,
take him away.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.605
He's scaring the kids.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.569
Dad, can Roger come with us?

34:30.819 --> 34:32.780
Yes, go prepare a bag,
hurry up.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.197
Make him leave, please.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.699
I'm hitting the road.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.701
He's scaring the kids.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.703
Dad, can Vicky come?

34:39.703 --> 34:42.121
Yes, we will all go,
go wake up your brother.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.583
Vicky isn't going anywhere,
Santino neither,

34:44.583 --> 34:46.502
you are leaving.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.920
I'll call the police.

34:48.212 --> 34:49.545
I made the decision,
I'm sorry.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.675
Santino,

34:53.675 --> 34:56.303
wake up your brother,
we are leaving now.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.388
What can't you understand?

34:58.388 --> 35:00.891
I make the decisions here.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.810
They aren't going anywhere.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.270
Have you heard me?

35:06.522 --> 35:08.357
You are scaring my family.

35:08.357 --> 35:11.527
A fucking rotten
in the town.

35:11.902 --> 35:14.404
Fuck you two.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.200
I saw him,
I was with him.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.410
We have to leave,
all of us.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.788
- Where are the car keys?
- What keys, you idiot!

35:22.788 --> 35:24.373
I don't want to argue.

35:24.373 --> 35:26.333
Stop, where are they?

35:26.333 --> 35:27.668
You are lying.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.837
You are just lying.

35:29.837 --> 35:31.547
Why are you screwing me?

35:31.547 --> 35:33.340
Can't you see me happy?

35:33.340 --> 35:35.592
You come here
to make me feel bad,

35:35.592 --> 35:37.761
scaring the kids.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.638
Fucking crazy.

35:39.638 --> 35:43.225
You disappeared for four years,
not a single dollar,

35:43.225 --> 35:44.852
and now you come back.

35:44.852 --> 35:48.605
I let you see the kids
like a fool, and what for?

35:48.605 --> 35:50.774
You come and screw with my life.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.526
Crazy fool.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.653
What have I done
to deserve this?

35:54.653 --> 35:55.904
Leave.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.198
Start a new life, loser.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.867
I don't want you here.

35:59.867 --> 36:01.493
Stop yelling.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.953
Stop yelling!

36:02.953 --> 36:04.746
Leave, you hear?

36:04.746 --> 36:08.750
There's a restraining order,
come to your senses.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.670
What can I do
to make you understand?

36:11.670 --> 36:13.839
You must understand,

36:13.839 --> 36:15.966
I'm telling you
there's a rotten,

36:15.966 --> 36:17.676
how can't you understand?

36:17.676 --> 36:19.803
You are insane.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.722
Are you conscious
of your words?

36:27.352 --> 36:29.521
Mom! Dad! Leo!

36:30.397 --> 36:32.566
I saw him myself.
How must I tell you?

36:32.566 --> 36:33.775
What's up?

36:33.775 --> 36:36.778
Roger bit Vicky,
it's hurting her.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.660
No!

36:44.620 --> 36:45.829
No! Vicky!

36:46.413 --> 36:49.333
Get him! Get him!

36:50.751 --> 36:51.835
No!

36:52.753 --> 36:54.630
No, no.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.632
Vicky!

36:56.632 --> 36:57.966
Roger!

37:01.929 --> 37:03.013
Vicky!

37:04.848 --> 37:06.058
Get him!

37:08.518 --> 37:09.436
Leo!

37:11.355 --> 37:12.397
Leo!

37:22.366 --> 37:25.744
My daughter, where is she?
Help me.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.788
Help me, where is she.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.539
Where is she?

37:29.539 --> 37:32.626
Pedro, what happened?
Where is she?

37:32.626 --> 37:34.419
Where is my daughter?

37:34.419 --> 37:35.963
Santino, son.

37:37.798 --> 37:41.843
Santino, we'll leave,
stay here, yes?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.516
Jair, son, it's dad.

37:48.058 --> 37:50.477
Son, son, look at me.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.062
It's dad, it's dad.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.814
Listen.

37:54.564 --> 37:57.067
No, don't bite yourself,
calm down.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.572
Jair, son.

38:02.572 --> 38:03.949
Son, look at me.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.910
Look at me, look at me.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.161
It's dad.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.871
Jair.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.331
Jair.

38:11.331 --> 38:14.835
Don't bite yourself,
don't do it.

38:15.168 --> 38:18.797
Jair, it's dad, I'm here.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.132
It's dad.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.468
Calm down, Jair.

38:23.719 --> 38:25.178
Calm down.

38:34.730 --> 38:38.025
Calm down, Jair,
calm down.

38:38.025 --> 38:39.109
Santi!

38:39.109 --> 38:40.736
We are leaving,

38:40.736 --> 38:41.945
hurry up, son.

38:41.945 --> 38:43.447
Where is she?

38:43.447 --> 38:44.865
Call the police.

38:44.865 --> 38:46.408
Where's the girl?

38:46.408 --> 38:48.035
Call the police.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.161
Calm down.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.669
Leo, don't use guns.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.505
Help me
find my daughter, fucker.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.090
Don't use gun powder, Leo.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.843
It's your children's sister, asshole.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.595
Help me find her.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.388
You won't find a dog,

39:08.388 --> 39:09.931
you'll find a demon.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.558
Leo.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.816
Leo, drop the gun.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.569
Don't use the gun.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.237
Leo.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.073
Damn it.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.628
Yazurlo, what's going on now?

39:39.628 --> 39:40.712
A dog.

39:41.171 --> 39:43.090
It attacked my ex's daughter.

39:43.090 --> 39:44.591
A big, brown dog.

39:44.591 --> 39:46.134
You called for a dog?

39:46.510 --> 39:48.637
It took her, Gutierrez.

39:48.637 --> 39:49.596
It took her.

39:49.596 --> 39:50.680
Call base.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.184
What happens, Yazurlo?
What's up?

39:55.185 --> 39:56.812
Another mistake?

39:56.812 --> 39:58.021
I'm talking to you.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.606
You heard me.

39:59.606 --> 40:00.941
You can't be here.

40:02.109 --> 40:04.194
You know you can't
get close to your wife.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.197
I'm talking to you,
what have you done?

40:07.572 --> 40:10.242
Don't shoot the dog,
don't do it.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.569
You are ok, love.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.572
Thanks, where is Leo?

40:49.739 --> 40:51.116
Tell him she is ok.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.742
Tell him.

40:53.743 --> 40:54.953
You are ok, love.

40:54.953 --> 40:58.248
Vicky is back,
she is back.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.001
Love, look at me.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.544
Does it hurt?

41:03.128 --> 41:04.337
Where is Leo?

41:04.796 --> 41:06.923
Tell Leo Vicky is fine, please.

41:07.841 --> 41:09.050
Are you ok?

41:09.759 --> 41:10.635
Look at me.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.678
Does it hurt?

41:15.599 --> 41:17.184
Go tell Leo, please.

41:17.184 --> 41:19.978
Vicky is fine, tell him.

41:23.064 --> 41:24.691
The car keys.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.736
Where are they?

41:28.904 --> 41:31.740
Son, Jair, it's me,
it's dad.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.827
Listen, where are the keys
of mom's car?

41:36.620 --> 41:37.871
Do you know?

41:37.871 --> 41:40.999
- Go fetch Jair's bag.
- He doesn't have one.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.918
- What then?
- A drawing.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.711
Bring it, where is it?

41:44.711 --> 41:46.880
- Where is it?
- He is holding it.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.256
Do you want ice-cream?

41:48.256 --> 41:49.925
Let's go have ice-cream.

41:49.925 --> 41:52.761
Apple ice-cream?
Let's have one.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.971
I can't find
the car keys.

41:54.971 --> 41:55.972
I can't.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.140
I'll go.

41:57.807 --> 42:00.936
I'll go, Santi,
I'll get the car.

42:00.936 --> 42:04.814
When I find the keys
of the grey car in the garage...

42:17.702 --> 42:19.412
Dad will kill you.

42:20.330 --> 42:22.290
What are you saying?

42:22.832 --> 42:24.084
Dad

42:24.084 --> 42:26.169
will come home

42:27.003 --> 42:28.380
in the car

42:28.922 --> 42:30.048
and pum!

42:35.053 --> 42:36.304
Love.

43:01.037 --> 43:02.789
Dad, what happened?

43:02.789 --> 43:05.333
Dad, what was that noise?

43:31.318 --> 43:32.319
Leo, Leo.

43:32.319 --> 43:33.695
Are you ok?

43:33.695 --> 43:34.446
Leo.

43:34.904 --> 43:37.240
Call the ambulance,
he is hurt.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.242
It's ok, easy.

44:05.935 --> 44:08.271
What's this surprise?

44:10.857 --> 44:14.944
I can't believe it,
they gave you the kids.

44:14.944 --> 44:16.321
What happened?

44:16.821 --> 44:18.031
What a nice surprise.

44:18.031 --> 44:19.282
I don't know...

44:19.532 --> 44:21.493
Sabrina?

44:21.785 --> 44:23.953
I Don't know

44:25.538 --> 44:27.290
Pedro, so nice.

44:27.290 --> 44:30.460
Don't they have school?

44:30.835 --> 44:32.712
Isn't this Sabrina's car?

44:32.712 --> 44:34.464
What have you agreed with her?

44:36.007 --> 44:37.258
Have you talked with Jimmy?

44:37.258 --> 44:39.094
No, I didn't tell her.

44:39.094 --> 44:40.345
What happened?

44:40.345 --> 44:41.554
Did someone die?

44:42.472 --> 44:44.265
Nobody died,
don't?

44:44.265 --> 44:46.935
We aren't going to a wake.

44:50.021 --> 44:53.942
We are too far away
for that to happen.

44:53.942 --> 44:56.820
That things happen
in the cities.

44:56.820 --> 45:00.365
You saw anything
you didn't understand,

45:00.365 --> 45:02.200
got scared

45:02.200 --> 45:04.285
and manipulated.

45:04.828 --> 45:06.413
It's happening, mom.

45:07.122 --> 45:09.416
Grandma,
what's a possessed one?

45:09.416 --> 45:12.752
I see you are sure,
but you may be wrong.

45:12.752 --> 45:14.087
We are sure.

45:15.004 --> 45:17.090
- Grandma.
- Stop, Santino.

45:17.465 --> 45:18.967
Are you sure, too?

45:20.218 --> 45:21.845
Yes, Jimmy too.

45:22.595 --> 45:25.181
Possessed, possessed.

45:25.432 --> 45:28.309
- Grandma.
- Stop, Santino.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.562
What did you agree
with Sabrina?

45:31.521 --> 45:33.022
What did she say?

45:34.190 --> 45:36.526
We are leaving town.

45:39.112 --> 45:41.364
Sabrina knows, doesn't she?

45:45.201 --> 45:47.203
Have you ever
witnessed this?

45:47.203 --> 45:48.163
What?

45:48.163 --> 45:50.582
Do you know someone
who saw a possessed one?

45:51.249 --> 45:53.001
No, never.

45:53.877 --> 45:56.504
I don't,
except from you two.

45:57.172 --> 46:00.008
You are making a fuss.

46:01.217 --> 46:04.220
Grandma,
what's a possessed one?

46:05.472 --> 46:08.016
Something really, really bad.

46:08.391 --> 46:11.269
It goes into a person

46:11.269 --> 46:13.980
and uses it's body
to be born.

46:14.355 --> 46:16.149
Like a disease?

46:16.441 --> 46:19.360
There's a song,
do you know it?

46:19.944 --> 46:20.862
No.

46:21.321 --> 46:23.323
It's famous.

46:23.907 --> 46:26.451
They get into your body,

46:26.451 --> 46:28.995
they infect your mind,

46:28.995 --> 46:32.332
they take the most valuable
thing in your life,

46:32.332 --> 46:34.417
your body is no longer
your body.

46:34.417 --> 46:36.252
That's really bad.

46:36.252 --> 46:37.295
Well,

46:38.171 --> 46:41.174
it's not that bad
if you take precautions.

46:41.174 --> 46:45.386
Look, there are
seven rules to follow

46:45.386 --> 46:48.431
and remember
when there's a possessed one.

46:48.932 --> 46:50.141
For what?

46:50.141 --> 46:52.519
So they don't get
into your head

46:52.519 --> 46:54.354
and make you do stuff

46:54.354 --> 46:56.022
you don't want to do.

46:57.106 --> 46:59.192
Don't use electric lights.

46:59.192 --> 47:01.402
Don't stay close to animals.

47:02.111 --> 47:06.574
Don't have to take anything
that was close to them.

47:06.574 --> 47:08.660
Don't hurt them.

47:09.244 --> 47:11.162
And a very important rule,

47:11.162 --> 47:14.415
never, ever name the evil
by its name.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.417
Evil has a name?

47:16.417 --> 47:18.211
Of course.

47:18.962 --> 47:19.629
Look...

47:20.088 --> 47:21.673
- Lucifer...
- Mom.

47:22.006 --> 47:23.633
- Azrael...
- Mom.

47:23.633 --> 47:25.134
Beelzebub.

47:25.134 --> 47:27.053
You are naming them.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.305
Yes, you are right.

47:31.474 --> 47:34.060
There's a very important rule, too.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.646
Don't shoot them
with fire arms.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.481
Stop, mom. Stop.

47:38.481 --> 47:39.691
What else.

47:40.483 --> 47:41.985
That's it.

47:43.111 --> 47:44.529
There's one missing.

47:45.154 --> 47:48.032
- Haven't I told the seven?
- No.

47:48.283 --> 47:50.118
That should be a rule.

47:50.994 --> 47:52.328
Don't forget the rules.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.001
Azrael.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.171
A simple apple ice-cream.

48:02.672 --> 48:04.132
They don't have apple.

48:04.132 --> 48:06.217
This is not enough, though.
Do you have money?

48:06.217 --> 48:07.635
It's all I had with me.

48:07.635 --> 48:08.636
Check.

48:08.636 --> 48:11.097
I'm telling you,
I don't have.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.433
You didn't ask me to.

48:13.433 --> 48:15.560
I thought
you were paying.

48:16.019 --> 48:17.103
Dad.

48:17.687 --> 48:19.314
I want to go home.

48:19.314 --> 48:21.357
We need to get more money.

48:21.357 --> 48:22.567
Dad.

48:28.531 --> 48:30.116
How are we going to eat?

48:30.116 --> 48:31.409
I want to go home.

48:32.118 --> 48:33.328
What about Jair?

48:35.580 --> 48:38.791
Where is a fucking
apple ice-cream...

48:41.252 --> 48:43.254
Jair won't stop.

48:44.047 --> 48:48.301
Well, we can go back to town,
we buy the ice-cream.

48:48.301 --> 48:49.636
Mom, no.

48:49.636 --> 48:51.554
How long could it take?

48:51.554 --> 48:53.556
No, mom, we can't go back.

48:58.811 --> 49:00.271
What are you doing
with the phone.

49:00.688 --> 49:03.024
- I told you to leave everything.
- I didn't.

49:03.024 --> 49:04.609
No, it's mine.

49:04.609 --> 49:06.110
It's mine.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.654
It's Sabrina.

49:09.656 --> 49:11.532
Talk to your mother.

49:12.742 --> 49:15.411
Dad, I want to talk to mom.

49:15.411 --> 49:16.746
It can't be her.

49:16.746 --> 49:18.373
Dad, I want to talk.

49:18.373 --> 49:20.249
Santino, it's not mom.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.377
Shall I answer?

49:25.296 --> 49:27.382
I want to talk to mom.

49:47.735 --> 49:48.653
Hello.

49:49.404 --> 49:51.322
<i>You took my children.</i>

49:51.614 --> 49:55.159
<i>I want them back.</i>

49:56.661 --> 49:57.745
The kids are alright.

49:57.745 --> 50:00.373
<i>Jair can't be far from home.</i>

50:00.373 --> 50:04.127
<i>He has to take his medicine,
bring him back!</i>

50:04.377 --> 50:06.379
<i>Jair will decompensate!</i>

50:06.379 --> 50:09.298
The kids are fine, Jair is fine,
they are fine with me.

50:09.841 --> 50:12.510
<i>Realize your sons
don't love you.</i>

50:12.510 --> 50:14.220
<i>They can't see you.</i>

50:14.220 --> 50:16.305
<i>They never want
to go to your house,</i>

50:16.305 --> 50:18.391
<i>they don't want
to live with you.</i>

50:18.391 --> 50:19.809
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

50:20.518 --> 50:22.729
<i>That's why I cheated on you.</i>

50:22.729 --> 50:25.565
<i>That's why I fucked everyone.</i>

50:25.565 --> 50:26.524
Sabrina.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.276
<i>You are no one.</i>

50:28.276 --> 50:31.612
<i>A little man, a little man.</i>

50:31.612 --> 50:34.407
<i>You gave me a broken kid.</i>

50:34.407 --> 50:37.160
<i>You wanted to get rid of him.</i>

50:37.160 --> 50:38.619
<i>You are a bastard.</i>

50:39.829 --> 50:41.372
<i>And a murderer.</i>

50:41.831 --> 50:43.499
<i>Everyone knows it.</i>

50:44.500 --> 50:46.753
<i>I know where you are.</i>

50:46.753 --> 50:49.172
<i>I'll come get my kids</i>

50:49.839 --> 50:51.758
<i>and get them back.</i>

50:52.175 --> 50:54.343
<i>You don't know
what I'm capable of.</i>

50:56.429 --> 50:57.722
Sabrina, I saw you die.

50:57.722 --> 50:59.724
<i>I'll get my kids,
do you hear?</i>

50:59.724 --> 51:02.268
<i>I'll get-</i>

51:07.565 --> 51:08.858
Brother, what happened?

51:10.359 --> 51:11.527
What happened?

51:13.196 --> 51:14.363
Sabrina is dead.

51:15.490 --> 51:18.576
Her husband hit her
with the truck, he killed her.

51:19.619 --> 51:20.870
That wasn't Sabrina.

51:21.913 --> 51:23.414
What do you mean?

51:26.417 --> 51:28.419
What? What happened?

51:28.419 --> 51:30.421
She is dead, Jimmy.

51:31.714 --> 51:34.383
I saw her die,
I saw her.

51:35.551 --> 51:37.428
I'm not even sure
of what's going on.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.222
I'm going crazy.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.560
I'm a coward.

51:46.979 --> 51:49.732
I can't handle my life,
I'm a coward.

51:50.525 --> 51:52.777
I doubt this is the right thing.

51:53.319 --> 51:55.238
I took the evil to her,

51:55.696 --> 51:58.449
I almost killed them all.

51:59.659 --> 52:03.871
We should have left
as soon as we knew.

52:04.705 --> 52:08.501
I should have never
come back to this town.

52:09.252 --> 52:11.379
Easy, don't say that.

52:12.588 --> 52:14.423
I'm proud of you.

52:15.925 --> 52:16.968
Come on, brother,

52:17.635 --> 52:19.387
the kids are watching.

52:19.387 --> 52:20.805
They will get scared.

52:20.805 --> 52:21.722
Come on.

52:21.722 --> 52:23.432
You didn't see what I saw.

52:25.768 --> 52:26.853
Come on.

52:33.943 --> 52:35.903
I know someone
that may be of help.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.365
She lives half-way to the city.

52:40.783 --> 52:42.451
What will you say?

52:42.952 --> 52:44.287
I'm not sure,

52:44.287 --> 52:46.747
but I think she lived
something similar to this.

52:47.790 --> 52:49.709
She can lend us money, too.

52:53.754 --> 52:55.339
Jair won't stop.

52:55.882 --> 53:00.386
He won't until I get him
apple ice-cream I promised.

53:01.804 --> 53:03.723
Brother,
get your head together.

53:03.723 --> 53:04.932
Get up.

53:05.975 --> 53:08.060
Mom will get upset.

53:19.363 --> 53:20.865
She is Mirta.

53:21.490 --> 53:22.909
How are you, ma'am?

53:23.701 --> 53:25.369
I have no electrical power,

53:25.369 --> 53:28.289
but there's room for everyone,
stay as long as you want.

53:28.289 --> 53:30.666
No, we are going to the city.

53:31.042 --> 53:32.960
Thank you, anyway.

53:39.342 --> 53:41.969
Pedro, are you sure
we'll be better in the city?

53:41.969 --> 53:43.679
Will she give us money?

53:43.679 --> 53:44.931
Yes.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.308
Let's stop for a while.

53:47.308 --> 53:48.601
We are tired.

53:49.018 --> 53:51.646
Jair needs changing.

53:51.646 --> 53:53.731
Mirta is ok with this.

53:54.398 --> 53:55.900
It's better for her,
she is alone.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.693
We can't, Jimmy.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.488
We are going to the city,
don't change the plan.

54:00.488 --> 54:01.614
Besides,

54:02.073 --> 54:03.783
tell her that...

54:03.783 --> 54:06.619
we'll give her the money back
because we are good people.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.040
That's an issue,

54:11.707 --> 54:13.542
she has the money
in the bank.

54:13.542 --> 54:15.461
It's there until Monday.

54:15.711 --> 54:18.047
We can meet her there.

54:18.047 --> 54:20.549
Jair needs changing.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.390
Dad, Jair pooped.

54:27.640 --> 54:28.933
He pooped.

54:33.396 --> 54:35.064
The kid looks rotten.

54:37.066 --> 54:38.484
He is autistic.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.071
Yes, you told me.

54:47.410 --> 54:48.911
You saw a real possessed one, right?

54:52.581 --> 54:53.916
Why do you ask?

54:54.417 --> 54:56.919
You told me.
When you lived in the city.

54:57.837 --> 54:59.755
You were close to one.

54:59.755 --> 55:00.840
Did I?

55:00.840 --> 55:02.049
Long ago.

55:03.426 --> 55:05.594
That you got used
to living among them.

55:06.846 --> 55:09.098
I don't know
why I said that.

55:09.932 --> 55:11.767
I'm good
at getting secrets out.

55:13.436 --> 55:14.895
What did you come here for?

55:18.149 --> 55:20.067
I think we saw
a possessed one for real.

55:21.152 --> 55:22.445
Where?

55:23.487 --> 55:24.572
In town?

55:27.533 --> 55:28.659
You got scared.

55:32.830 --> 55:33.956
It seems so.

55:35.124 --> 55:38.627
If you saw a possessed one,
you wouldn't say "I think".

55:39.628 --> 55:41.756
You wouldn't doubt a bit.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.675
I'm not sure what we saw.

55:46.010 --> 55:47.720
Babies who don't cry?

55:49.055 --> 55:50.806
Shadows that move
on their own?

55:50.806 --> 55:53.142
Animals doing stuff
they'll never do?

55:53.142 --> 55:55.061
I don't know
what we saw.

55:57.813 --> 56:00.775
Maybe it was
my brother's imagination.

56:00.775 --> 56:02.234
But maybe not.

56:02.735 --> 56:05.696
Maybe it's real
and I can't understand.

56:06.489 --> 56:10.159
Is that the brother who plugged
the heater outtake?

56:12.036 --> 56:15.164
That was a lie his wife told
to keep the children.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.126
He suffered a lot.

56:21.629 --> 56:24.590
People from town are bored
and like talking shit,

56:24.590 --> 56:27.093
after all, it's free.

56:31.806 --> 56:33.516
It's ok, darling.

56:34.725 --> 56:36.727
Well, well.

56:37.269 --> 56:38.604
Yes?

56:38.604 --> 56:42.108
Close your little eyes,

56:43.859 --> 56:45.736
don't open them...

56:50.533 --> 56:51.742
He won't sleep.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.537
Are you staying up
another night?

56:55.037 --> 56:58.499
I'd rather mom tucks Santino in
and I'll look after Jair.

56:59.208 --> 57:00.835
He won't leave the car.

57:02.837 --> 57:04.171
Let's take turns.

57:04.547 --> 57:05.673
No.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.760
So, this is the famous Mirta.

57:11.262 --> 57:12.179
Mirta.

57:14.890 --> 57:15.975
Why are you smiling?

57:16.892 --> 57:18.144
Why are you smiling?

57:18.144 --> 57:19.270
I'm not.

57:22.690 --> 57:23.732
It was long ago.

57:25.109 --> 57:26.277
I was younger.

57:27.736 --> 57:28.779
She was, too.

57:29.113 --> 57:30.197
Of course.

57:31.073 --> 57:32.992
You were always a lovebird.

57:33.576 --> 57:35.244
Always a lovebird.

57:36.078 --> 57:38.539
Every year you cried
like a pig.

57:39.582 --> 57:41.584
You said
you missed the teachers.

57:46.839 --> 57:48.174
I love you, brother.

58:01.729 --> 58:04.523
I'm here, son, I'm here.

58:04.523 --> 58:07.026
It's dad.

58:07.776 --> 58:08.944
I'll take care of you.

58:11.071 --> 58:12.781
Nothing will happen to you.

59:51.380 --> 59:52.881
Sabrina?

59:53.882 --> 59:55.259
Is that you?

59:58.804 --> 01:00:01.056
I'm happy you are here.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:03.475
I'm a bit drugged.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:07.479
I took my sleeping pills.

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:11.442
I came for my children.

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:14.987
Because they need me.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.741
I'm taking my children

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.286
to a place where no one
can harm them.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.915
Mom, I'm cold.

01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:31.253
Pedro.

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:33.213
Pedro.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.841
Something's going on.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.808
I can't say what I saw,

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.311
but it wasn't her,
I thought it was Sabrina,

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.771
but I don't know.

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:49.730
Calm down.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:50.898
I can't say,

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:53.108
but there's someone
with Santino.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:55.277
I'm not sure.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.696
Calm down, mom.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:59.365
I came down to tell you,

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:01.700
because I'm afraid.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.993
I'm afraid.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.328
I didn't know what to do.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.454
Calm down.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.956
- I was too scared.
- Calm down.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.459
- I didn't know what to do.
- Easy.

01:01:21.804 --> 01:01:23.430
I came for my children.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.850
Because they need me.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:29.311
I'm taking my children

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.439
to a place where no one
can harm them.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.991
Dad.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.121
No, no!

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:48.997
Son.

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.252
She jumped, that fucker.

01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:54.962
She jumped with Santino.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.422
She took him.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:57.506
Fucker.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:01:59.842
Where is he?

01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:00.926
Where?

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:02.344
He has to be here.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.388
Look over there.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.056
Son!

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.058
Son!

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:10.060
Jair.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.020
Jair.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.148
Jair.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.191
Son.

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:18.193
Jair, son.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:20.279
Jair, son.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.407
Son.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.075
It's dad.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.161
Son, son.

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:29.621
Son, open, open.

01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:31.915
Jair.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.340
Jair, son, are you ok?

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.093
Are you ok?
It's dad.

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.387
Jair is fine.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.055
What's this blood?

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:49.099
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.309
Go get some flashlights.

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:52.060
We need flashlights.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:52.978
Jaime.

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:54.104
Santino.

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:55.606
Son.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.525
Santino.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:00.444
Son.

01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:03.614
Santino.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.452
Are there more flashlights?

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.537
Something to light.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.831
Jaime, there's a demon.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.583
It took my nephew.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.251
It's inside the kid.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.336
No, he is like that.

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:18.462
No, Jaime.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.672
He is like that.

01:03:20.923 --> 01:03:23.467
Shut up, Jaime,
listen to me.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.263
Come over here
and look at the kid.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:32.559
Look at his feet and hands.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.979
A demon got into his head
and is trapped.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.024
I saw this in autistic people.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:42.486
They invade their bodies but
can't figure out their minds.

01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:46.198
They can stay lost
in that limbo for a long time

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:48.575
without untying the knot,
and then they possess them.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.162
The kid can be possessed,
do you get it?

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:55.874
Jimmy, I need you,
the flashlight.

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:58.377
Go get your brother,
we need to get inside.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.587
I can't leave him alone.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.965
It took Santino,
it must be near.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:05.300
It is near,
it is everywhere.

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:06.969
Listen to me,

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:08.720
both of you.

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:13.642
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:25.654
The song says so.

01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:28.407
If you are afraid
of falling into a hole,

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:30.659
It will put a hole
under you.

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:36.665
There's people like us,
whose thoughts It can't control.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.085
But It can manipulate us,

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:41.461
because in here,

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.922
I'm sure that it is here,

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:45.424
It was, some time,

01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:48.218
It was
and it got information.

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:52.347
It's the seventh rule,
don't be afraid of dying.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.267
She wouldn't be here

01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:59.187
if you weren't afraid
she would take the kids.

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:02.024
You can't go get your kid.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:05.027
You must understand why.

01:05:05.444 --> 01:05:07.779
Your fear of losing him
helps the demon.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:11.658
Evil knows more about your fears
than you do.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:14.536
Then I'll go,
I'll get Santino.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:16.038
I promise I'll find him.

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:17.289
I'll go, too,

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.625
she must be near town.

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:23.211
No, we have to find
the rotten.

01:05:24.713 --> 01:05:27.507
Kill the man to stop
the beast from being born.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.218
The rotten is dead
or this won't be happening.

01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:31.511
No, no.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.222
This is what we call
"the birth process".

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.767
For now, It just
freed its essence.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.144
It may not
be physically born,

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:41.647
so we have to kill it, to
abort it as soon as possible.

01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:43.607
We know where he is.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.150
We do know.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.818
It's near General Piran.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.446
That's far from town.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.157
How are you so sure?

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:53.617
We...

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.578
moved the man
and took him there.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:01.333
You moved a rotten?

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.754
Knowing he was possessed?

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.131
You idiots.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.805
Jaime.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.517
The town lights.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.852
They are off.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:24.398
They cut the power,
they activated the protocol.

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.776
Who knows
what's going on.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.530
It's dangerous
to go back.

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:34.866
Don't use lights.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:38.453
Be careful.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.314
My husband was a shepherd,

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.275
we had a church.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:10.819
We were frauds.

01:07:13.447 --> 01:07:14.740
The first possessed one
in Buenos Aires

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.908
appeared in our church.

01:07:17.284 --> 01:07:22.289
At first, I thought
it was an actor we hired,

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:25.500
until he puked over all of us.

01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:27.711
He puked up the rest
of the family

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:30.172
he had eaten the previous night.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.383
God is dead,

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:36.553
and the times of churches
ended quickly.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.557
Then the cobras appeared,

01:07:41.183 --> 01:07:44.686
those monks who taught us
there was a way

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.855
of killing them before
they were born.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:51.651
That's what we did
for twelve years.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:57.741
We took responsibility for
the damage we did to faith.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.511
Ambushes started
growing in number.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.889
It's no surprise
they killed the cleaner.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:24.350
That's why everything turned...

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:26.853
secretive.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:29.397
We had to be too careful.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.651
We were old for this.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:34.986
You lose your reflexes.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.363
One night, my husband...

01:08:39.241 --> 01:08:40.992
didn't come back
from a cleaning.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.412
Then I left town.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:47.249
From evil,

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.377
you only escape
leaving everything behind

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:52.462
and running away

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:55.340
to a place
even you don't know existed.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:57.634
That's what I did.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.970
Such a coincidence,
you here,

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:01.763
in the middle of nowhere.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:07.310
What if evil finally found me
inside Jaime's head?

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:15.359
What if It infected the town
just for me?

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:18.613
Why didn't It take you
instead of my son?

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.412
Because you are the one
who is afraid.

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:12.852
We'll have to continue on foot.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.815
If he moved
or was moved,

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.733
it will be impossible
to find him.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.402
There.

01:11:21.403 --> 01:11:22.821
He must be there.

01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:23.989
RURAL SCHOOL

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:28.076
Evil likes children,
and children like evil.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.117
Jimmy.

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.163
You told me you loved me.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:35.643
I'm hungry.

01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:39.481
And cold, grandma.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:42.901
Can you prepare
something hot to drink?

01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:46.112
Tea or something.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.666
I don't want
to get sick.

01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:14.224
Turn the lights off.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:24.943
How do you know
it's not too late?

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.363
Because what Evil eats first
when born

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:30.198
is the sound of nature.

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:34.786
Birds and crickets
are still chirping.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.789
No more lights.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.165
No more lights.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.584
Don't use electric stuff.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.031
Where is it?

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.159
Is it here?

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.454
Are you hiding it here?

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.210
Can you tell me
where it is?

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.382
We came to help you.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.210
What happened?

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.421
What happened?

01:17:14.172 --> 01:17:15.340
Didn't...

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:17.300
Didn't you smell it?

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.509
What?

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:21.054
The breath of the kids.

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:22.847
They won't help us.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.265
But you said
it was here.

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:25.933
Or they are hiding it.

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:27.477
Somewhere.

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:30.480
I've never seen
such a thing.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.776
I don't know
if I can deal with this.

01:17:35.193 --> 01:17:37.945
All those kids together.

01:17:41.032 --> 01:17:43.034
is he coming here?

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:46.412
Kids protect the rotten.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.414
This is crazy.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.876
Don't scare him.

01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:54.253
Kid.

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:57.173
Are you going to school?

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.341
Listen to me.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.176
Do you know
about someone,

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:01.803
or maybe your friends do,

01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:04.806
about someone hurt,

01:18:04.806 --> 01:18:06.974
injured near here?

01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:09.060
Did you find
someone sick

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.978
or injured near here?

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:13.147
Yesterday or the day before.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.401
I'm talking to you!
Answer me!

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.988
I'll go inside
and make him talk.

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:21.906
No.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:23.241
It's not a good idea.

01:18:23.241 --> 01:18:26.160
Is there any other idea?
Any good idea?

01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:29.789
I'll make him talk no matter
how, I don't give a damn.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:30.498
No.

01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:32.375
We can't make mistakes.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.961
Not one,
our lives are at stake.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.171
Let me think.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.342
We shouldn't rush now.

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:46.013
We have to keep an eye
on each other.

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:50.601
Are you looking for Uriel?

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:52.103
Yes, yes.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:54.397
He's at teacher Cortez's house.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.815
Where is that?

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:57.900
Don't you know?

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.193
No, I don't.

01:18:59.986 --> 01:19:01.112
Near the traffic circle.

01:19:01.112 --> 01:19:02.280
Traffic circle, yes.

01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:04.282
An entrance with trees.

01:19:04.282 --> 01:19:05.533
On the traffic circle?

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:09.036
Can you come with us?

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:16.544
Let's go.

01:19:18.004 --> 01:19:19.380
Mirta, come on.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.059
It may not be like that,

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.520
and there's someone
waiting for us.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:35.980
A trap?

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:38.566
We have no time,
we have to find out.

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:39.901
Let's go.

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:42.487
It's a lie.

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:45.990
A lie, don't go
where he said.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:48.409
He is not there,
Uriel is in my house,

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:51.245
in my house,
in my house.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:54.582
My father wanted to help
and cure him.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:58.586
I live there, in the hill,
but please be careful.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:02.048
Motherfuckers,
stop lying, fuckers.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.674
Motherfuckers.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:07.512
They took my son,
I want my son, fuckers.

01:20:07.512 --> 01:20:09.222
Fuckers.

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:12.058
It is here, Pedro.

01:20:16.062 --> 01:20:17.522
It is here.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:31.577
If they send us somewhere else,

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.250
it's because they have him here.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.956
Dead...

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:18.749
the adults.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:23.170
I have never seen this.

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:26.549
Did the kids do it?

01:21:28.718 --> 01:21:30.344
Those aren't kids anymore.

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:32.597
Go get my stuff.

01:21:33.306 --> 01:21:34.682
Don't run.

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:38.060
Don't hurry.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:42.106
It's possible It is down there.

01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:53.200
I told you not to run.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.077
Be careful.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.143
We found you, motherfucker.

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:21.562
We found you.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:25.024
You have to leave,
he wants to kill you.

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:27.652
He wants to kill you,
don't you see it?

01:22:27.652 --> 01:22:31.197
The parents and teachers are
dead, they are there inside.

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:32.448
Don't move.

01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.659
Don't even move.

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:37.370
They covered the bodies
with lime to hide the smell,

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.455
so they can't be found.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.749
Please, you have to leave.

01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:44.502
They are bad,
you will die,

01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:46.253
you have to leave.

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:48.464
You will die.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:53.094
We have to take him out. Hurry.

01:22:53.094 --> 01:22:55.096
We have no more time.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.604
Go away, you still have time.
Go away.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:16.617
No, no, no.

01:23:22.123 --> 01:23:23.290
Come on, Pedro.

01:23:34.135 --> 01:23:36.512
Pedro, don't waste more time.

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:41.392
No, please, no.

01:23:41.392 --> 01:23:42.560
One is alive.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.770
It doesn't matter,
take the rotten.

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.731
We have no time.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:53.821
You'll die, leave, please.

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:58.325
You'll die, leave.

01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:02.329
Hurry,
we have to take him out now.

01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:05.332
You're gonna get infected.

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:16.635
It's here.

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:17.762
Is it alive?

01:24:18.429 --> 01:24:19.346
I don't know.

01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:23.350
He is moving.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:25.728
Kill me.

01:24:27.855 --> 01:24:29.899
Kill me now.

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.276
Don't think about it.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.612
The only way to kill him
is using this.

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:36.238
Take him out.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.908
Get this over with

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.659
Hurry, Pedro.

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.455
His nape,
I need to see his nape.

01:24:45.206 --> 01:24:46.207
I can't.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.833
I can't lift him.

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:51.295
This goes into his nape,
I need to see it.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:52.797
I can't.

01:24:53.214 --> 01:24:54.423
Come, help me.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:55.341
No.

01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:56.592
I can't do it alone.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:57.802
Keep her away.

01:24:57.802 --> 01:24:59.386
I have to dismantle
the stage.

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:00.805
Do it then.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:03.432
You wanted to kill yourself,

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.267
with your kids,

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.394
you can do that to me.

01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:08.938
Shut up, fucker.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:11.148
Shut up, shut up.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.691
There's an axe
in the director's office,

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:14.902
the axe for the fires.

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:16.237
No, she is lying.

01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:17.363
In a red cabinet.

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:18.531
She is lying.

01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:19.865
I saw it.

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:20.991
Pedro,

01:25:21.492 --> 01:25:23.285
all of this is your fault.

01:25:24.829 --> 01:25:27.665
Don't listen,
don't let him manipulate you,

01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:29.708
take the rotten.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.752
Do it for Santino,

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:33.796
don't let him die.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:36.507
You can still save him.

01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:38.843
Yes, yes, bring the axe.

01:25:38.843 --> 01:25:40.594
No, Pedro.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:41.762
Kill me.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:46.684
It's a trap,
don't leave me alone.

01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:48.519
Don't leave me alone.

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:52.314
No.

01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:53.607
No.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.573
Fuckers.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:12.668
No, no, no!

01:26:58.505 --> 01:26:59.798
Pedro...

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:36.700
There was...

01:31:37.784 --> 01:31:40.370
a voice in my head,

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:46.168
which forced me
to kill the person

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.046
who was going
to help Uriel.

01:31:50.297 --> 01:31:53.091
I cut his body into pieces,

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:56.803
I fed it to the pigs.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:02.726
I also ate,
I ate from that body.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:04.811
And your mom?

01:32:05.646 --> 01:32:06.688
What happened to her?

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:09.650
The same that happened
to your mother.

01:32:35.133 --> 01:32:36.176
Slowly, son.

01:32:57.114 --> 01:32:58.365
Breathe.

01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:01.368
Come on.

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:11.169
Don't bite.

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:12.713
Open.

01:33:13.297 --> 01:33:14.339
Open.
