WEBVTT

00:39.481 --> 00:40.561
Where the fuck is it?

00:43.561 --> 00:44.841
I can see it.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.860
Shhhh....Shhhhh.

01:00.881 --> 01:04.001
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming...
It's coming, it's coming.

01:19.001 --> 01:20.681
Where the fuck is it?

02:01.081 --> 02:02.641
Let's get the fuck out of here.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.540
He wanted to play soccer

03:47.660 --> 03:49.460
for a well known club.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.750
Do you know what they said?

03:54.248 --> 03:56.468
He wasn't fast enough.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.930
Pack your things.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.320
We're leaving.

04:07.610 --> 04:09.270
You want to continue?

04:09.690 --> 04:11.790
Isn't it better to go back
to the observatory?

04:12.120 --> 04:13.960
And then?

04:15.520 --> 04:16.980
What can we do there?

04:17.339 --> 04:18.839
This was your idea.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.410
You wanted to find the signal.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.870
You wanted to come.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.320
Start getting ready.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.760
Don't shoot!

05:04.830 --> 05:05.830
What the fuck is that?

05:05.910 --> 05:07.820
It's okay, it's dead.
My wife shot it.

05:09.521 --> 05:10.761
You better get inside.

05:11.201 --> 05:12.081
Come on!

05:24.441 --> 05:25.361
So where are you going?

05:25.721 --> 05:27.961
To my laboratory at the university.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.140
I'm trying to find a way
to kill these things.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.120
Well, best of luck with that.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.160
It's gone.

05:58.601 --> 06:00.481
We're in an apartment nearby.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.441
You should just come with us.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.820
There is coffee in the kitchen.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.370
Thanks.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.980
Noah loves you.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.460
How do you know that?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.770
After the attack he was determined...

07:04.980 --> 07:06.760
to find you and Sacha.

07:08.995 --> 07:11.585
I'm glad I stopped.

07:11.991 --> 07:15.001
Are you scared of getting cancer?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.480
I'm pregnant.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.240
How far along are you?

07:25.370 --> 07:26.390
16 weeks.

07:26.850 --> 07:28.120
Really shitty timing.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.450
Where's the father?

07:39.520 --> 07:41.200
What are you going to do?

07:41.310 --> 07:42.710
What would you do in my place?

08:20.360 --> 08:21.180
Mum?

08:23.240 --> 08:24.280
Mum!

08:30.161 --> 08:31.521
What is it?

08:31.520 --> 08:32.590
Tom?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.041
Oh my God!

08:35.561 --> 08:37.400
It's okay, it's dead.

08:37.561 --> 08:38.961
What's it doing here?

08:39.801 --> 08:41.081
Ask them.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.081
Hi.

08:53.210 --> 08:54.320
I have to go.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.430
You're going to be safer to go
with your brother

08:58.450 --> 08:59.480
than anywhere else.

09:00.401 --> 09:01.961
You think I'm safe?

09:04.801 --> 09:07.041
Well, I hope you find your family.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.900
Say goodbye to Sacha for me?

09:10.930 --> 09:11.630
Aha.

09:12.561 --> 09:13.721
Good luck.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.040
Yup.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.640
Here's some blankets
if you need them.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.840
There's a double in our room

09:45.850 --> 09:47.080
if you and your husband want to swap.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.120
Ex-husband.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.700
I think we'll be fine here.

09:49.740 --> 09:51.190
Right. Sorry.

09:56.681 --> 09:58.401
Have you seen other people?

09:58.921 --> 10:00.161
Just one.

10:00.481 --> 10:01.841
What happened to them?

10:02.001 --> 10:03.081
She...

10:04.041 --> 10:05.921
"went" to be with her children.

10:14.201 --> 10:15.801
I'm glad you're here.

10:16.281 --> 10:17.801
I'll let you settle in.

10:34.481 --> 10:36.121
Is that it's brain?

10:38.320 --> 10:39.664
You see how tightly bound

10:39.761 --> 10:42.001
the neural packages are?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.070
There's a very high corelation between

10:44.090 --> 10:46.120
neuron density and intelligence.

10:46.281 --> 10:47.601
What does that mean?

10:50.680 --> 10:52.970
A larger animal like an elephant...

10:53.000 --> 10:54.810
They have...they have a bigger brain,

10:54.840 --> 10:57.160
but lower neuron density.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.350
Where as a bird,

10:58.390 --> 10:59.920
with a smaller brain

10:59.960 --> 11:02.040
has a greater neuron density.

11:03.561 --> 11:04.961
I guess it means that

11:05.121 --> 11:07.281
you're more likely to be intelligent

11:07.681 --> 11:08.761
if you're "dense".

11:08.921 --> 11:09.961
Is that a joke?

11:09.984 --> 11:11.120
Kind of.

11:12.281 --> 11:14.041
They have brains like birds?

11:14.100 --> 11:14.810
No, it's...

11:14.830 --> 11:17.330
it's a completely differetn
neuron structure.

11:19.441 --> 11:21.561
I think it's just a simple
killing machine.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.500
I don't think it's capable
of developing

11:24.360 --> 11:26.640
sophisticated technology.

11:27.481 --> 11:28.561
So...

11:28.921 --> 11:30.161
what does that mean?

11:30.401 --> 11:32.321
That means this is the monkey,

11:32.481 --> 11:34.521
not the organ grinder.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.020
It's some kind of mirror.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.680
It could be a scanner.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.900
Is it an eye?

12:37.950 --> 12:39.690
There's no optic nerve.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.150
If it's not connected to the brain

12:41.180 --> 12:43.440
how the hell does it see?

12:43.961 --> 12:45.241
Is it blind?

12:46.270 --> 12:48.040
Well, what's the mirror for?

12:51.481 --> 12:53.001
My sister's blind.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.441
She was.

12:56.321 --> 12:58.361
Ever since the attack she
started to see again.

13:00.841 --> 13:02.041
What do you mean?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.490
She can see...

13:04.540 --> 13:05.960
but not like before.

13:06.561 --> 13:08.201
She says it's different.

13:09.761 --> 13:11.281
In what way different?

13:12.161 --> 13:13.561
You'll have to ask her.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.552
What if it uses some kind of...sonar?

13:22.561 --> 13:24.041
Like a bat.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.681
Maybe.

13:26.081 --> 13:27.321
That's a good question.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.830
You know what the most important
scientific discovery is?

13:30.830 --> 13:31.680
Ignorance.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.250
And when we discovered
how little we knew,

13:33.280 --> 13:34.890
we had to look for answers.

13:37.930 --> 13:39.470
I didn't mean to interrupt.

13:39.670 --> 13:41.390
I'll let you get on with it.

13:46.841 --> 13:48.161
Is she okay?

13:53.121 --> 13:54.641
We had a son...

13:56.681 --> 13:58.441
a little but older than you.

14:00.176 --> 14:03.960
Did...they kill him?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.210
What are you reading?

14:22.250 --> 14:23.480
A novel?

14:25.550 --> 14:26.800
What's it about?

14:27.170 --> 14:29.160
It's about a man who hurts people.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.860
Why?

14:37.760 --> 14:39.640
I don't know.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.280
I think he enjoys it.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.610
Do you enjoy reading...

14:52.070 --> 14:53.210
that kind of thing?

14:53.857 --> 14:54.927
Not really.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.688
I don't like reading.

15:03.680 --> 15:04.970
How are you feeling?

15:06.740 --> 15:07.760
Is everything alright?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.050
Are you okay?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.160
Do you want breakfast?

15:17.190 --> 15:18.040
No.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.080
Well...

15:25.600 --> 15:26.480
Maybe later.

15:26.530 --> 15:27.400
Mmmm.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.280
What's up with Sacha?

15:56.250 --> 15:57.480
He's acting strange.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.220
Maybe he doesn't like you.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.240
He liked me before you came.

16:07.582 --> 16:10.672
It's probably puberty.

16:20.666 --> 16:22.196
You didn't make coffee?

16:24.408 --> 16:26.818
You've always been lazy.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.580
You never got out of bed
in the morning,

16:29.600 --> 16:31.590
not even when you had school.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.050
You were horrible.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.810
You drove Mum crazy.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.810
Your new boyfriend...

16:48.430 --> 16:49.750
he actually wants to die.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.570
Is he stupid or what?

16:54.770 --> 16:55.660
His family is dead.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.630
You don't know that.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.650
You think you should've
gone with him.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.760
That wouldn't have been very smart.

17:12.579 --> 17:15.349
Only stupid people
dig their own graves.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.079
The best he can hope for

17:20.180 --> 17:21.609
is a quick death.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.030
Us too.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.380
Don't say that.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.560
Don't say that, okay?

17:45.480 --> 17:46.190
You're back.

17:46.220 --> 17:47.280
Hi.

17:47.840 --> 17:48.660
Hi.

17:49.641 --> 17:51.361
I have something for you.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.180
Oh, what is it?

17:53.220 --> 17:54.210
Your stick.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.241
You left it at the hospital.

17:56.401 --> 17:57.521
Thank you.

17:57.880 --> 17:58.910
We're going to search

17:58.940 --> 18:00.640
the other apartments for food.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.256
Is there something you want?

18:02.304 --> 18:04.720
Umm...spaghetti hoops.

18:06.761 --> 18:08.841
I'll see what we can find.

18:15.401 --> 18:17.241
Hey, Loverboy!
Come on.

18:22.361 --> 18:23.321
Hi, Love.

18:24.361 --> 18:25.721
Are you hungry?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.450
There's some cereal bars

18:27.460 --> 18:29.480
and Ash found a camping stove.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.561
Do you eat beans and eggs?

18:37.201 --> 18:38.601
Emily, what is it?

18:40.121 --> 18:41.601
There's something there.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.470
It's one of those things.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.840
It's dead.

18:46.641 --> 18:48.361
How'd you know it was there?

18:48.881 --> 18:50.401
I can feel it.

18:52.361 --> 18:53.521
What's it doing here?

18:53.681 --> 18:55.201
When they were coming back
from the hospital

18:55.360 --> 18:56.910
Ash and Kareem met some people.

18:56.940 --> 18:57.960
Bill and Helen.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.800
He's trying to figure out
how to kill them.

18:59.856 --> 19:01.680
I don't think you should
be doing that.

19:02.401 --> 19:04.201
Just come away from it, now.

19:07.281 --> 19:08.841
You must be Emily.

19:10.761 --> 19:12.201
How did it die?

19:13.841 --> 19:15.481
It tried to kill me

19:16.161 --> 19:17.641
and my wife shot it.

19:20.361 --> 19:21.521
What's wrong?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.721
I felt it...

19:24.561 --> 19:25.881
die.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.601
I don't know what's happening to her.

19:45.121 --> 19:48.201
Tom says that she started to see again

19:48.361 --> 19:49.601
after the attack.

19:49.761 --> 19:51.481
It comes and goes.
That's what she says.

19:52.761 --> 19:54.001
You don't believe her?

19:54.160 --> 19:54.900
The doctors said

19:54.930 --> 19:56.600
her sight will never return

19:57.360 --> 19:59.150
She developed Stargardt's disease

19:59.180 --> 20:00.520
when she was 13.

20:00.681 --> 20:02.641
Has anything like that ever
happened before?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.480
She's had hallucinations.

20:04.510 --> 20:06.470
The doctors said that can happen, but

20:06.500 --> 20:09.080
Um...it wasn't like this.

20:11.521 --> 20:13.521
She's been hearing things too.

20:14.401 --> 20:15.681
What kind of things?

20:15.841 --> 20:18.481
She said it's a pulsating sound.

20:19.681 --> 20:21.241
No one else has heard it.

20:46.176 --> 20:48.240
Oh, it stinks so bad!

20:52.521 --> 20:54.241
It looks like someone has 
already been here.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.960
So are you planning on making move

21:02.990 --> 21:04.080
any time soon?

21:04.441 --> 21:05.841
Make a move?

21:06.240 --> 21:07.920
Don't you want Emily?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.392
You think she likes me?

21:11.440 --> 21:12.440
you're blinder than she is.
Mate, if you can't see that

21:12.440 --> 21:14.080
you're blinder than she is.

21:15.081 --> 21:16.921
Did you find any spaghetti hoops?

21:17.080 --> 21:17.820
No chance.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.760
Posh people don't do tinned foods.

21:19.921 --> 21:21.961
It's all fresh and organic.

21:22.512 --> 21:24.480
They've screwed me already.

21:33.521 --> 21:36.001
He must have got in there
to hide from the attack.

21:36.441 --> 21:38.801
Mate, you have had a nightmare.

22:38.641 --> 22:40.561
Maybe you should talk to Bill.

22:40.721 --> 22:42.641
he studies neurology.

22:43.641 --> 22:45.001
Leave me alone.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.350
Em...

22:46.370 --> 22:48.320
Will you please just fuck off?

25:12.280 --> 25:14.720
What are those pills for?

25:15.600 --> 25:16.890
Your hand was shaking.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.310
What's wrong with you?

25:25.786 --> 25:27.186
Tell me.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.720
I have muscular dystrophy.

25:51.240 --> 25:54.200
Is it hereditary?

25:54.275 --> 25:57.315
Can Sacha get it too?

25:58.730 --> 26:00.720
I'm sorry.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.960
Oh shit!

26:10.350 --> 26:11.830
Let's go!

26:12.871 --> 26:14.881
That sound.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.100
Didn't you hear it?

26:16.440 --> 26:17.870
Come with me.

26:18.782 --> 26:20.682
Hurry up! Hurry up!

26:20.720 --> 26:21.980
Where did you see them?

26:22.010 --> 26:23.010
300 meters away.

26:23.050 --> 26:24.426
How many of them?

26:24.426 --> 26:24.440
One, for now.
How many of them?

26:24.440 --> 26:25.726
One, for now.

26:25.768 --> 26:28.328
Do what I say.

26:28.330 --> 26:29.090
And Alexis?

26:29.110 --> 26:30.910
Do you want to wait?

26:30.968 --> 26:32.718
Let's go!

27:00.360 --> 27:03.280
Get out of here! Fast!

27:03.306 --> 27:05.956
Come on, Noah! This way!

27:11.120 --> 27:13.520
Noah, hurry up!

27:21.040 --> 27:24.120
Come on! Go! Go!

27:38.880 --> 27:39.900
Chloé?

27:46.390 --> 27:47.690
Chloé?

28:18.920 --> 28:20.270
No!

28:22.070 --> 28:23.150
Sasha!

28:23.160 --> 28:25.240
You can't get through this way! Go around!

28:25.260 --> 28:27.150
We'll meet you at the factory!

28:27.970 --> 28:29.510
Go no! Go!

30:15.173 --> 30:17.193
Sacha, unlock the door!

30:17.330 --> 30:18.320
Sacha!

30:18.520 --> 30:20.220
Sacha, open up!

30:20.250 --> 30:21.630
You shouldn't have done that to Mum.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.480
Open the door! Open the door!

30:25.040 --> 30:26.650
Open it, damn it!

30:26.680 --> 30:28.440
What are you doing?

30:28.760 --> 30:29.900
Sacha!

30:32.770 --> 30:34.370
You won't hurt her again.

32:19.330 --> 32:21.830
This is probably where
the signal came from.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.462
Give me the map, Nathan.

32:37.208 --> 32:38.278
Look.

32:41.004 --> 32:42.984
Here's where the
signal dropped out.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.320
Has it been shot down?

32:48.380 --> 32:49.850
If there were soldiers here,

32:49.880 --> 32:51.430
we would have known.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.660
Where's Noah?

33:35.850 --> 33:37.120
I tried to help him.

33:39.710 --> 33:40.720
But...

33:49.530 --> 33:51.240
It's not your fault.

33:57.961 --> 33:59.441
You came back.

34:01.321 --> 34:02.921
We should get off the road.

34:03.361 --> 34:04.081
Come on.

34:59.350 --> 35:00.330
What's that?

35:01.730 --> 35:03.600
It's some kind of organic tissue.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.550
Is everything okay?

36:10.900 --> 36:12.150
What is it?

36:13.040 --> 36:18.410
One of those things just walked past.

37:29.740 --> 37:32.010
It's like it didn't see us.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.080
Maybe they were damaged
in the crash.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.940
They don't look damaged.

37:45.150 --> 37:46.500
Don't move.

38:21.830 --> 38:22.570
What's in there?

38:22.600 --> 38:23.600
No idea.

38:34.950 --> 38:37.280
Is this one of them?

38:39.280 --> 38:41.070
Is this what they look like?

38:42.728 --> 38:45.318
It is burned.
You can hardly tell what it is.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.281
Where are you at with that thing?

39:22.521 --> 39:24.801
I just really getting started.

39:28.641 --> 39:30.921
Yeah, they took some babies
from the hospital.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.361
What do you mean?

39:36.280 --> 39:38.080
They killed everyone else but

39:38.170 --> 39:40.080
the babies were gone.

39:40.961 --> 39:42.481
Why would they do that?

39:58.481 --> 39:59.761
It's Kariem.

39:59.921 --> 40:01.241
Can I come in?

40:09.681 --> 40:12.081
There is something I want
to show you.

40:15.841 --> 40:17.481
I'm not really in the mood for surprises.

40:17.641 --> 40:19.081
I think you will like it.

40:19.601 --> 40:20.681
Please.

40:52.401 --> 40:54.201
You said you missed it.

41:54.521 --> 41:56.241
Single beds...

41:58.600 --> 41:59.660
It reminds me of the time

41:59.680 --> 42:01.880
we used to stay over at
your parent's house.

42:02.281 --> 42:03.561
Remember?

42:04.290 --> 42:06.340
They'd be in every couple of minutes.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.070
They didn't want their good 
Catholic daughter

42:11.090 --> 42:12.660
to burn in hell.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.180
Well...that ship had sailed.

42:37.241 --> 42:38.681
What was that?

42:41.041 --> 42:42.481
I don't know.

42:44.601 --> 42:46.521
I can't remember how I know it.

42:51.801 --> 42:52.881
Your hand...

43:07.921 --> 43:09.561
It's so embarrassing.

43:10.641 --> 43:11.721
What?

43:14.321 --> 43:15.681
In the shop,

43:16.721 --> 43:18.121
when we met...

43:19.241 --> 43:20.401
I weed on you.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.670
The world has ended

43:21.690 --> 43:23.520
and you're worried that 
you pissed on me?

43:23.681 --> 43:24.721
Yes.

43:25.521 --> 43:27.361
I pointed a gun at you.

43:28.041 --> 43:29.161
I was scared.

43:31.081 --> 43:32.441
I'm sorry.

43:32.601 --> 43:34.121
I guess we're even.

43:40.121 --> 43:42.001
Do you think it's too soon?

43:42.481 --> 43:44.161
After what's happened?

43:45.161 --> 43:46.841
Too soon for what?

43:47.321 --> 43:48.881
To have sex.

43:54.001 --> 43:55.401
Would you like to?

43:58.401 --> 43:59.481
Yes.

46:15.961 --> 46:17.361
What does it mean?

46:19.201 --> 46:20.441
I don't know.

46:20.881 --> 46:22.521
My friend chose it.

46:26.041 --> 46:27.921
The mark of your tribe.

46:31.201 --> 46:32.761
Something like that.
