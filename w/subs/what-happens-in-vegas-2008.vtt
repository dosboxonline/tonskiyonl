a little change of pace,

01:09.152 --> 01:12.446
thought somebody deserves
something special for his birthday.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.572
Yeah. It's good.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.450
Okay, so I made
reservations tonight at Babbo at 8:30.

01:16.534 --> 01:20.245
I thought maybe we could talk about,
you know, setting a date?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.791
Did you just make a plan to make a plan?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.751
-Did I just do that again?
-Yeah, you did.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.878
-Sorry.

What? No! I want a key.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.554

in these little slutty outfits.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.058

Can I sue him for something?

07:33.744 --> 07:36.788

is that he's your dad.

to go over to Mason's house,
ring his doorbell,

08:09.405 --> 08:12.199

they're just gonna, bang,

08:12.283 --> 08:14.743
junkpunch him
right up in his man business

08:14.827 --> 08:15.994
and then he's gonna keel over.

screaming, "Why?"

08:19.207 --> 08:21.333
they'll go, "You know why!"

I complain, and you tell me
there's nothing you can do,

11:53.295 --> 11:55.630
but we both know that's a big, fat lie,

11:55.798 --> 11:57.841
so why don't you just
save us both the trouble

11:57.925 --> 11:59.300
and type in those special codes

11:59.385 --> 12:01.261
that you know
you're gonna type in eventually

12:01.345 --> 12:05.265
and find me two rooms that are so nice

12:05.850 --> 12:08.101
that it turns my night right back around?

She's awfully hostile for a girl named Joy.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.484
I'm going to do exactly
what you're telling me to do, because

12:17.361 --> 12:18.737
I'm a little frightened of you.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.988
These are penthouse suites.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.490
You can't get any higher than that
without going on the roof,

12:22.575 --> 12:26.411
and you're not allowed on the roof,
because people jump.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.418

12:33.502 --> 12:34.878
-Nice!
-No!

12:34.962 --> 12:36.838
-Yeah.
-That's not bad.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.673
Well, you're welcome.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.800
Now watch and learn.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.928
-Hey, buddy.
-Oh, hi. How are you?

12:44.013 --> 12:46.931
I think you just met my friend back there.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.433
Kind of a scary person.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.101
Oh, Egyptian cotton. That's nice.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.771
I want to apologize for her.
For three weeks out of the month,

12:52.855 --> 12:54.773
we get to enjoy
God's most precious creation,

12:54.857 --> 12:56.608
and on week four, the bill arrives.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.277
(LAUGHS) I know what you mean.
A period, right?

13:00.070 --> 13:01.070
(EXCLAIMS)

13:01.363 --> 13:03.615
Look, I don't want to push here,

13:03.699 --> 13:07.452
but I know that a man in your position
is capable of producing certain amenities.

Hey. So, you're from New York,
we're from New York.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.226
-We're going to Le Cirque, please!
-Come on.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.772
Look, I didn't bring my buddy
all the way out to Vegas

13:35.940 --> 13:37.482
so he could get his ass kicked. Right?

13:37.566 --> 13:39.317
So the least you could do is help me
show him a good time.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.487
Your buddy wouldn't know a good time
if it sat on his face.

13:42.571 --> 13:46.825
Okay, you know what, Stripper?
You are kind of a disgusting skank.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.952
Driver, we'll get out here! Thank you !

13:49.036 --> 13:50.119
-Okay, bye!
-Thank you.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.914
-Use a condom, boys.
-Bye-bye. Bye. Just go!

13:56.752 --> 13:58.336
Oh, come on. One drink.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.922
I'm a pretty fun guy. You can ask around.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.133
Thanks, but we have dinner reservations.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.262
And we have to map out our assault
on the Strip.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.640
You have a plan to make plans?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.355
Excuse me?

14:18.148 --> 14:20.692
I bet you look really good
with your hair down.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.944
-My hair is down.
-One drink!

14:24.446 --> 14:25.822
I dare you !

14:33.873 --> 14:36.916
Did I invent hip-hop? No. But I was there.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.794
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.838
-So, Joy.
-Yeah?

14:41.922 --> 14:43.715
What brings you to Sin City?

How about yourself?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.432
Yeah. Me? Oh, I'm here on business.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.393
Big business, actually. I'm. . .

14:59.398 --> 15:00.565

15:01.525 --> 15:02.525
No.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.652
Actually,

15:06.530 --> 15:11.326
I just got fired. So, cheers to that.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.666
I just got dumped, so, salud.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.754
Did I mention that I got fired
by my boss-slash-father?

15:22.838 --> 15:26.341
Did I mention that I threw
a surprise birthday party for my fiancÃ©

15:26.425 --> 15:29.510
and the surprise was that he dumped me
in front of all of our closest friends

15:29.595 --> 15:31.804

-All right. Roll them out.

No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't. . .
I wouldn't bet on me winning.

but it's somebody else's race.

-It's like Egypt!
-It's amazing !

16:28.404 --> 16:31.531

so you took yourself out of the game.

using, the one I loosened up for you !

More importantly, Your Honor, my client
only knew Miss McNally for four hours

when I want to light her on fire,

26:10.235 --> 26:12.820
but I don't, because I love her,

26:12.904 --> 26:14.321

I might be old-fashioned,

I meant them.

into weekly marital counseling.

I want you two to listen to me.

You better play by my rules on this,
or I'm gonna tie this money up in litigation

so protracted, so expensive

-No judgments.
-But I'm not. . .

Just saying.

35:07.772 --> 35:08.939
Ready to do this?

35:09.023 --> 35:12.859

in my nose every time I look at you?

35:13.694 --> 35:14.861
Yes.

35:16.030 --> 35:19.991
So, Jack, tell me about yourself.
What are your hobbies?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.327
Hobbies.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.372
You mean, besides my marriage?

35:27.041 --> 35:28.291
My hobbies.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.460
Mostly, I just like loving her.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.379
It's just so easy.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.216
What else?

35:36.843 --> 35:42.389
Listening. I love listening
to what she has to say. It's just. . .

35:42.473 --> 35:45.809
In fact, actually,
I carry this notebook around with me,

35:45.893 --> 35:49.855
just so I can write it down,
because usually it's so important.

35:50.481 --> 35:54.693
What else?
I think just being there for her, in general.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.321
Loving her until it hurts.

35:59.198 --> 36:00.490
It hurts.

36:01.075 --> 36:04.870
That's. . . I don't know,
that's probably most of my interests.

36:07.582 --> 36:08.999
Joy?

36:09.083 --> 36:10.667
I'd have to agree.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.253
And I'd have to add, you know,

36:14.297 --> 36:15.714
staring at him.

36:15.798 --> 36:20.177
Yeah. I mean, I just love watching him be.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.595
I love everything about him.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.055
Most people would be repulsed,

36:24.140 --> 36:27.225
you know, to find his socks
and his dirty underwear

36:27.310 --> 36:30.103
sort of down shoved
in the bottom of the bed,

36:30.188 --> 36:31.855
touching them in the middle of the night.

36:31.939 --> 36:34.274
They might want to try
to, like, scrub and scrub and scrub

36:34.358 --> 36:38.320
and try to get the stains
and the scent off of them, but. . .

36:39.447 --> 36:43.283
Not me. I just. . . I love it!

36:43.367 --> 36:47.370
I just. . .
I kind of want to just roll around in it!

36:50.208 --> 36:52.250
Her candles smell awesome!

36:54.795 --> 36:57.172
You know, I do have a few degrees,

36:57.256 --> 37:00.884
and I went to a bunch
of really expensive schools.

37:00.968 --> 37:04.721
Anyway, I'm not buying any of the bullshit
you two are selling today.

37:04.805 --> 37:07.390
Now, if you want me to report back
to the court

37:07.475 --> 37:09.267
that you're both working
on your marriage,

37:09.352 --> 37:12.020
you're gonna actually have to do that.

on my popcorn.

"movie theater butter,"

37:52.311 --> 37:54.104

what I really wanted
was Jack's Sweaty Ballsack flavor.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.796
It goes up,

38:20.339 --> 38:23.008
and then it goes down. Like that.

See that? Isn't that magical? Amazing.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.637

-No, that's actually the light side.

-We got robbed.

39:22.651 --> 39:24.944

39:33.245 --> 39:35.955
I don't know how people do this.
It's unnatural.

Men and women are not meant to coexist.

39:40.169 --> 39:43.213
And I haven't had sex in forever.
I mean, forever!

39:43.297 --> 39:45.298
And I need to have sex,
'cause I'm good at it!

39:45.383 --> 39:47.550
That's a self-esteem booster for me.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.595
-I don't know if I can do this, man.
-Oh, really?

39:50.679 --> 39:53.473
'Cause I haven't been sensing that at all.

39:53.557 --> 39:54.974
That's why I did a little research.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.684
I've been looking through some case law,

39:56.769 --> 39:58.728
you know, some precedent
to help us get around the ruling.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.815
And I think I found one. Lafferty v. Holden.

40:02.650 --> 40:05.527
You know, Tip,
I don't know if I can do this.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.445
Then we go to plan B.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.656
Mother's third marriage
was to this 20-year-old

40:09.740 --> 40:12.575
club-footed Cuban bartender
who came into a ton of money.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.744
The court said
that if they both wanted the money,

40:14.829 --> 40:17.580
they had to remain married and prove
they can make it work. Sound familiar?

40:17.665 --> 40:19.666
Mother wasn't going to see a cent of that,

40:19.750 --> 40:22.001
but then she proved
that he'd been unfaithful,

40:22.086 --> 40:24.129
and the judge ruled in her favor.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.297
And gave her all the money.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.218
See, the judge said that you had to prove

40:30.302 --> 40:32.011
that you were trying
to make the marriage work.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.514
But if we can make it seem like she isn't. . .

40:34.598 --> 40:36.307
I don't know
why I haven't thought of this before!

40:36.392 --> 40:38.101
-Because you're not a very good lawyer.
-Oh, my God.

40:38.185 --> 40:41.062
There should be a law
against how bad a lawyer I am.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.147
But then again, I wouldn't know about it!

40:42.231 --> 40:45.108
So if I can get Jack to end the marriage
by either leaving me

40:45.192 --> 40:47.569
or cheating on me. . .

40:47.653 --> 40:49.154
Not only would you get out
of the marriage. . .

40:49.238 --> 40:52.699
-You will also get the full $3 million.
-Oh, my God.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.869

-JOY: Well, something must've stuck.

58:30.131 --> 58:31.882
Do you know he made this bar
we're sitting at?

58:31.966 --> 58:34.384
Isn't it beautiful? I mean, look.

58:34.594 --> 58:36.803
Dovetail's off on the corner.

58:37.931 --> 58:39.223
It's off!

58:40.266 --> 58:42.267
Well, I think it's great.

58:42.936 --> 58:45.521
I actually think that Jack
could sell his furniture.

58:45.605 --> 58:48.023
I don't know.
That would require actually finishing it.

58:48.107 --> 58:50.484
Maybe you should try telling Jack
you don't want him to finish it,

58:50.568 --> 58:53.028
then maybe he would actually do it.

58:53.112 --> 58:55.864
(ALL LAUGHING)

58:55.949 --> 58:57.491
What are you doing on Saturday?

58:57.575 --> 59:00.077
You've got to come to Uncle Pat's
birthday in the park with us.

59:00.161 --> 59:01.787
I would love to.

59:02.789 --> 59:04.540
She went after my family!

59:04.624 --> 59:06.708
Dude, you're letting this chick
get in your head.

59:06.793 --> 59:08.252
Yeah, I know.

59:09.504 --> 59:12.130
Now I'm going to figure out
how to get into hers.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.091
You should never let a chick
get in your head.

59:14.175 --> 59:17.302
That's why I prefer
not to even talk to my dates.

59:22.642 --> 59:23.725
Yes!

59:24.978 --> 59:27.980
Why didn't I think of this before?
If she's going to play dirty, so am I.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.736
-Hi.
-Hey. Jameson, on the rocks.

59:40.994 --> 59:43.078
-You're Mason, right?
-Yeah.

59:43.329 --> 59:45.998
I'm Jack Fuller. I'm a friend of Joy's.

59:46.332 --> 59:47.332
-Joy's?
-Yeah.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.960
I just wanted to give you this back.

59:50.878 --> 59:52.379
She threw it in the trash.

59:52.463 --> 59:55.090
But, you know, guy code, I couldn't just
let it end up in the trash.

59:55.174 --> 59:57.259
I mean, you spent, what, like,
five, six thousand on this thing.

59:57.343 --> 59:59.261
Actually, thirty grand.

1:00:00.930 --> 1:00:02.180
I got it.

1:00:03.683 --> 1:00:05.642
All right. Well, thanks.

1:00:07.145 --> 1:00:08.228
Okay.

1:00:12.567 --> 1:00:14.359
Hey, how's she doing?

1:00:17.739 --> 1:00:19.031
You know, she's good.

1:00:19.115 --> 1:00:21.033
She's probably put on some weight,
though, right?

1:00:21.117 --> 1:00:22.993
From all the emotional eating
due to the break-up?

1:00:23.077 --> 1:00:25.245
You really lived up to the billing.
You know that?

1:00:25.330 --> 1:00:27.706
Joy told me
what an impressive guy you are.

1:00:27.790 --> 1:00:28.874
Oh ! Yeah.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:32.169
She said she was trying to be
so perfect, because

1:00:32.879 --> 1:00:37.299
deep down, she never really felt
like she was good enough to be with you.

1:00:37.884 --> 1:00:40.594
But those insecurities are long gone now.

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:43.680
She's really come into her own.
She's on fire!

1:00:43.765 --> 1:00:46.516
I'll tell you what, she not gonna be
on the open market for very long.

1:00:46.601 --> 1:00:49.144
-It's a feeding frenzy out there!
-A feeding frenzy, huh? Yeah.

1:00:49.228 --> 1:00:51.188
Well, I gotta get going.

1:00:51.856 --> 1:00:55.067
My Uncle Pat is having a birthday party
tomorrow in Grove Park.

1:00:55.151 --> 1:00:56.276
Joy and I are going.

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:59.821
Anyway, I gotta go pick up the present
she got for him. Bag of weed !

1:00:59.906 --> 1:01:01.365
-Her idea!
-Really?

1:01:01.449 --> 1:01:03.158
-She's on fire!
-Wow .

1:01:03.242 --> 1:01:04.493
On fire.

1:01:06.329 --> 1:01:08.080
Well, thanks again.

1:01:12.752 --> 1:01:13.752
(HEY MAN NOW YOU'RE REALLY LIVING
PLAYING)

1:01:13.836 --> 1:01:15.545
Stripper! Hiya!

1:01:15.630 --> 1:01:18.590
-I so want to junkpunch that guy.
-What's with you and junkpunching?

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:20.717
-Joy?
-Hi !

1:01:20.802 --> 1:01:23.011
I'm so glad you could make it.
Hey, sweetie.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:26.723
-Hi ! This is my girlfriend, Tipper.
-Hi, Tipper. Judy.

1:01:27.433 --> 1:01:28.809
-Thanks for calling.
-Where's Jack?

1:01:28.893 --> 1:01:31.770
He's over there,
coaching the Little League.

1:01:32.355 --> 1:01:35.273
Do you know what it's Iike
to faII on the fIoor?

1:01:35.608 --> 1:01:38.026
And cry your guts out tiII you got no more

1:01:38.111 --> 1:01:40.195
Come on, sweetheart.
I want my new daughter-in-law

1:01:40.279 --> 1:01:42.823
-to meet the whole family.
-Smile!

1:01:42.949 --> 1:01:44.199
JACK: One, two, three,

1:01:44.283 --> 1:01:45.325
-Rockets!
-Rockets!

1:01:45.410 --> 1:01:47.452
Who wants sugar? Let's go!

1:01:47.787 --> 1:01:50.455
What is this, like a five-foot hoagie?

1:01:51.374 --> 1:01:52.374
-Hi !
-Hi.

1:01:52.458 --> 1:01:56.878
This is my niece, and BFF ,
the great Sammy Sosa.

1:01:56.963 --> 1:02:01.466
Sammy, this is your Aunt Joy.

1:02:01.551 --> 1:02:03.552
-Nice to meet you, Sammy.
-Hi, Joy.

1:02:03.636 --> 1:02:05.303
I didn't know you coached Little League.

1:02:05.388 --> 1:02:08.390
Oh, there's a lot of things you don't know
about me. Isn't that right?

1:02:08.474 --> 1:02:13.061
Jack wore a little fedora
and a leather jacket to school

1:02:13.146 --> 1:02:14.646
every day for six months.

1:02:14.731 --> 1:02:17.315
Who wouldn't want to be Indiana Jones?

1:02:17.775 --> 1:02:18.942
I agree completely. I mean,

1:02:19.026 --> 1:02:23.029
Raiders of the Lost Ark may be
the greatest movie ever made.

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:31.455
-I don't think I like what's going on here.
-What, are we bonding now?

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:37.419
Hey man now you're reaIIy Iiving

1:02:37.503 --> 1:02:39.254
(BOTH CHEERING)

1:02:39.338 --> 1:02:40.672
Yeah.

1:02:40.965 --> 1:02:43.049
She doesn't seem so bad, Uncle Jack.

1:02:43.509 --> 1:02:46.595
I think you guys should just
split the money and stay married.

1:02:46.846 --> 1:02:49.139
Make a hundred pretty babies.

1:02:50.975 --> 1:02:52.392
You told her?

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:56.104
Yeah, I don't have secrets from Sammy.
I tell her everything.

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:59.149
Hey man now you're reaIIy Iiving

1:02:59.484 --> 1:03:05.238
WeII I just saw the sun rise over the hiII
Never used to give me much of a thriII

1:03:05.531 --> 1:03:09.367
But hey man now you're reaIIy Iiving

1:03:09.452 --> 1:03:13.288
Well, ladies, I believe
this is where we go our separate ways.

1:03:13.539 --> 1:03:15.040
Thank you.

1:03:18.044 --> 1:03:21.046
PeopIe sing

1:03:21.130 --> 1:03:24.049
Do you know what it's Iike
to faII on the fIoor?

1:03:24.133 --> 1:03:26.802
And cry your guts out tiII you got no more

1:03:26.886 --> 1:03:30.388
Hey man now you're reaIIy Iiving

1:03:30.473 --> 1:03:31.681
Joy!

1:03:32.058 --> 1:03:33.308
Mason.

1:03:33.684 --> 1:03:36.478
-What are you doing here?
-I was just visiting some friends.

1:03:36.562 --> 1:03:39.189
-In Brooklyn?
-Well, yeah. Yeah.

1:03:39.273 --> 1:03:41.733
Brooklyn. The B. K. Love it here.

1:03:41.818 --> 1:03:43.401
MASON: Yeah, they're artists. Yeah.

1:03:43.486 --> 1:03:46.238
Hey, you want to go grab a glass of vino?
Maybe chat up for a bit?

1:03:46.364 --> 1:03:50.325
I can't right now. Sorry.

1:03:50.409 --> 1:03:54.454
-Okay, all right. Well, maybe next week.
-I have my retreat.

1:03:55.748 --> 1:03:56.748
Wow!

1:03:58.251 --> 1:04:00.418
You seem fine.

1:04:01.796 --> 1:04:05.423
No, I mean, you look great.
Doesn't she look great? You look great.

1:04:05.758 --> 1:04:07.259
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

1:04:07.718 --> 1:04:09.219
I. . . Yeah.

1:04:10.721 --> 1:04:12.889
-I gotta go.
-Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

1:04:13.057 --> 1:04:15.809
-All right, well, maybe some other time.
-Yeah.

1:04:15.893 --> 1:04:17.644
Good seeing you.
Good bumping into you like that. Weird.

1:04:18.771 --> 1:04:20.105
Take care.

1:04:25.778 --> 1:04:27.946
-Oh, my God. You're falling for her.
-What?

1:04:28.114 --> 1:04:31.116
-You're falling for your wife! You idiot!
-What are you talking about?

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:33.827
-She's a wily temptress.
-"A wily temptress."

1:04:33.911 --> 1:04:35.287
-Yes!
-You just said "wily temptress."

1:04:35.371 --> 1:04:37.247
Yes, I did, because that is what she is.

1:04:37.790 --> 1:04:40.125
And what do wily temptresses do, Jack?

1:04:40.293 --> 1:04:44.337
They tempt in a wily fashion.
And then they play you.

1:04:45.006 --> 1:04:49.217
Tempt, play, tempt, play.
And she's playing you, my friend.

1:04:49.302 --> 1:04:52.470
Don't let her play you
out of what is rightfully yours.

1:04:52.555 --> 1:04:56.641
Keep your eyes on the prize, Jack!
Eyes on the prize.

1:05:05.735 --> 1:05:08.695
Hey, McNally.
What'd you do, take the weekend off?

1:05:08.779 --> 1:05:09.905
-Oh. . .
-Have fun?

1:05:09.989 --> 1:05:12.157
No, I remember when I didn't care
about my career, either.

1:05:12.241 --> 1:05:16.244
I'm sorry, I just had this thing
this weekend with my husband's family. . .

1:05:16.329 --> 1:05:18.163
Your husband? You got married?

1:05:18.289 --> 1:05:20.498
Well, thanks for the invite.
I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.

1:05:20.666 --> 1:05:22.876
Yeah, no, I'm married.
I didn't tell you that?

1:05:23.002 --> 1:05:25.962
No, you didn't.
I guess you're not a big sharer.

1:05:26.047 --> 1:05:28.298
Now, listen, Joy,
I've been in this business for a long time.

1:05:28.382 --> 1:05:31.468
And the thing that I value most
in my employees is honesty.

1:05:31.552 --> 1:05:35.013
So I'm gonna be honest with you.
Right now, you and Chong are tied.

1:05:35.097 --> 1:05:38.016
Now, Chonger is bringing her husband
to the retreat.

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:41.686
-I think you should bring yours, too.
-He will be there.

1:05:42.521 --> 1:05:44.814
-You can count on it, sir.
-Good.

1:05:50.655 --> 1:05:51.655
No?

1:05:53.574 --> 1:05:56.034
No. I have a lot of stuff
to do this weekend,

1:05:56.118 --> 1:05:57.994
and while the idea of hanging out
with you and playing house

1:05:58.079 --> 1:06:02.248
in front of all your boring co-workers
sounds not fun at all,

1:06:02.583 --> 1:06:04.417
I'm going to have to pass.

1:06:06.545 --> 1:06:09.923
This is really important for my promotion.
You see,

1:06:10.549 --> 1:06:13.885
my boss said that he wants
to meet my husband

1:06:15.304 --> 1:06:17.514
so I just promised him
that you would be there.

1:06:17.598 --> 1:06:19.933
Maybe you should have asked me first.

1:06:20.977 --> 1:06:22.185
Okay.

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:26.398
-I need this, Jack.
-I need a lot of things, Joy.

1:06:31.570 --> 1:06:32.779
So let me get this straight.

1:06:32.863 --> 1:06:36.449
She asked you
to come to a retreat for her job.

1:06:36.534 --> 1:06:37.826
Yeah.

1:06:37.910 --> 1:06:40.870
The most important thing
to her in the world.

1:06:41.998 --> 1:06:44.624
Do you believe that? I was like, "No!"

1:06:46.627 --> 1:06:52.507
'Cause I'm like. . . I'm like,
"Hey, what are you still doing here?"

1:06:53.384 --> 1:06:56.344
Jack! You have got
to get your ass down there,

1:06:56.429 --> 1:06:59.055
pretend to be the perfect husband,
charm them all, and then,

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:01.933
when you have them eating
out of the palm of your hand,

1:07:02.018 --> 1:07:03.935
you make her sign this.

1:07:05.312 --> 1:07:07.605
-What's this?
-This is a document, okay,

1:07:08.399 --> 1:07:11.192
relinquishing all the rights to the money.

1:07:11.652 --> 1:07:16.865
Right? You tell her if she doesn't sign it,
you're gonna out her in front of everybody.

1:07:19.285 --> 1:07:20.410
Yeah.

1:07:22.329 --> 1:07:23.872
I mean, that's not, you know. . .

1:07:23.956 --> 1:07:26.082
It's not pretty, but we can. . .

1:07:26.667 --> 1:07:28.334
I can laminate it.

1:07:31.922 --> 1:07:35.800
-I don't know.
-Okay, look, Jack, the hearing's in a week.

1:07:35.885 --> 1:07:38.011
Okay? This is our last shot.

1:07:58.866 --> 1:08:00.992
-Hey, McNally.
-Mr. Banger.

1:08:01.327 --> 1:08:02.577
So, where's this husband of yours?

1:08:02.661 --> 1:08:05.497
I just met Chonger's husband.
He's a very smart guy.

1:08:05.581 --> 1:08:07.665
He's a tool, but he's smart.

1:08:08.167 --> 1:08:09.501
He's. . .

1:08:09.585 --> 1:08:11.711
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

1:08:11.796 --> 1:08:15.465
So the spaceman says,
"I don't even have a vagina!"

1:08:15.549 --> 1:08:16.925
He's there!

1:08:18.511 --> 1:08:20.637
I'll just take this to him.

1:08:22.973 --> 1:08:24.891
Mr. Banger, I just wanted
to take this moment

1:08:24.975 --> 1:08:27.519
to express to you my gratitude.

1:08:28.938 --> 1:08:30.730
I'll be seeing you at the. . .

1:08:31.148 --> 1:08:32.357
The dining table.

1:08:32.983 --> 1:08:34.359
-Hey, hey!
-Hey.

1:08:35.361 --> 1:08:36.945
(LAUGHS)

1:08:37.029 --> 1:08:38.071
I'm so glad to see you.

1:08:38.155 --> 1:08:39.823
Muffin, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1:08:39.907 --> 1:08:43.368
This is why everyone
should have their wife on LoJack.

1:08:43.869 --> 1:08:46.871
Let me introduce you to my friends.
This is David Young, your CFO .

1:08:46.956 --> 1:08:48.957
Mr. Young. An honor. Hi.

1:08:49.208 --> 1:08:51.709
And this is the rest of your board, actually.

1:08:52.002 --> 1:08:54.921
Great people. Wealthy people.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

1:08:57.174 --> 1:08:58.633
So you're the lucky guy.

1:08:58.717 --> 1:09:01.344
-Hi. Jack Fuller.
-I'm Richard Banger.

1:09:02.346 --> 1:09:04.055
You're in my seat.

1:09:05.141 --> 1:09:07.600
Wait, your name is Richard Banger?

1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:10.061
Your name is Dick Banger.

1:09:10.187 --> 1:09:11.980
Dick Banger! Dick Banger?

1:09:12.106 --> 1:09:16.109

These two have

1:24:20.638 --> 1:24:22.264
a lot of issues.

1:24:22.682 --> 1:24:26.310
A lot of deeply unsettling issues

1:24:26.728 --> 1:24:30.105
that, as individuals,
they seriously need to work on.

1:24:31.107 --> 1:24:32.441
Seriously.

1:24:33.985 --> 1:24:36.820
But together, in my honest opinion,

1:24:38.198 --> 1:24:40.491
they're perfect for each other.

1:24:41.076 --> 1:24:42.326
It's the real thing.

1:24:43.286 --> 1:24:44.620
Go figure.

1:24:46.331 --> 1:24:49.166
Well, thank you, Doctor.
You may step down.

1:24:52.003 --> 1:24:53.337
Tipper!

1:25:00.512 --> 1:25:02.096
Hi, Your Honor.

1:25:02.931 --> 1:25:04.515
Have you lost weight?

1:25:06.601 --> 1:25:08.352
Gotcha. Let's begin.

1:25:08.978 --> 1:25:14.066
Although Ms. McNally ran up $25,000
in credit card debt in my client's name,

1:25:14.150 --> 1:25:16.819
my client recently spent the same amount

1:25:16.903 --> 1:25:19.863
for materials
for his new furniture business.

1:25:20.198 --> 1:25:23.242
Therefore, we propose
the following settlement, Your Honor.

1:25:23.493 --> 1:25:25.869
The original $3 million,
deduct half for taxes

1:25:25.954 --> 1:25:28.664
and $50 ,000 that's already been spent,

1:25:28.748 --> 1:25:31.750
that leaves $1 .45 million to be divided. . .

1:25:36.714 --> 1:25:37.923
equally.

1:25:38.007 --> 1:25:41.885
Now that's the spirit!
You've learned to share! Do you accept?

1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:50.602
No, Your Honor, we do not.

1:25:50.687 --> 1:25:51.687
(COUGHS)

1:25:51.771 --> 1:25:53.522
(WHISPERS) Gold-digging whore.

1:25:53.606 --> 1:25:57.568
My client has advised me that
she doesn't want any of the money.

1:25:58.486 --> 1:26:00.445
She just wants a divorce.

1:26:01.364 --> 1:26:03.490
Miss McNally, are you sure?

1:26:06.452 --> 1:26:07.995
Yes, Your Honor, I am.

1:26:08.079 --> 1:26:13.083
Well, then I hereby grant the divorce
and award all the monies to Mr. Fuller.

1:26:13.585 --> 1:26:15.377
Court adjourned.

1:26:20.925 --> 1:26:22.509
You win, Jack.

1:26:22.594 --> 1:26:25.095
I officially want nothing from you.

1:26:32.061 --> 1:26:33.604
Oh, my God.

1:26:33.688 --> 1:26:36.732
I won a case! Jesus Christ!

1:26:36.816 --> 1:26:38.859
Dude, we won !

1:26:39.110 --> 1:26:40.360
I won !

1:26:40.445 --> 1:26:43.197
Yeah ! I'm the law, bitches!

1:26:43.281 --> 1:26:44.865
I'm a lawyer!

1:26:45.533 --> 1:26:46.783
HATER: To me!

1:26:47.535 --> 1:26:49.369
Anybody need a lawyer?

1:26:49.454 --> 1:26:51.330
(TONIGHT I HAVE TO LEAVE IT PLAYING)

1:26:51.789 --> 1:26:53.916
And tonight I have to Ieave it

1:26:54.209 --> 1:26:56.543
It's hard out there, isn't it?

1:26:57.503 --> 1:26:59.379
Time heals all wounds.

1:27:03.134 --> 1:27:07.971
Now that you guys are officially done,
is there any chance I can get her number.

1:27:09.557 --> 1:27:10.974
E-mail is fine.

1:27:12.685 --> 1:27:14.478
Go ahead, run it.

1:27:18.191 --> 1:27:21.985
Have any idea what her plans
are going to be for the future?

1:27:25.949 --> 1:27:27.324
Yeah, okay.

1:27:27.742 --> 1:27:30.452
You don't have to answer that right now.

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:36.667
MAN: Hey, I have a question.

1:27:37.835 --> 1:27:39.920
How much does an island cost?

1:27:48.096 --> 1:27:51.181
BANGER: Now we come to the final item
on our agenda.

1:27:53.101 --> 1:27:55.102
Congratulations, McNally.

1:27:57.855 --> 1:28:00.482
Thank you, sir. I won't let you down.

1:28:06.406 --> 1:28:09.366
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to
let you down.

1:28:09.450 --> 1:28:11.952
Why don't you just give it to Chong,
you know?

1:28:12.036 --> 1:28:13.453
She's good, she deserves it,

1:28:13.538 --> 1:28:15.998
and besides,
I think she just enjoys being miserable.

1:28:16.374 --> 1:28:18.583
-Yes!
-You sure you know what you're doing?

1:28:18.668 --> 1:28:21.628
No, I don't. But I think that's the point.

1:28:22.922 --> 1:28:25.549
I would rather do nothing and be happy

1:28:26.426 --> 1:28:29.011
than do something that I don't love.

1:28:42.025 --> 1:28:43.817
Well, I lost her at happy.

1:28:43.901 --> 1:28:45.652
I don't know what the hell
she was trying to say anyway.

1:28:45.737 --> 1:28:48.238
Well done, Chonger. The job is yours.

1:28:52.035 --> 1:28:53.327
Thank you.

1:28:53.911 --> 1:28:55.996
So! Jack made a piece of furniture.

1:28:56.998 --> 1:28:58.415
He finished it.

1:28:58.499 --> 1:29:00.167
Okay. Go ahead, Dad.
What's wrong with it?

1:29:00.251 --> 1:29:01.710
Nothing. It's good.

1:29:01.794 --> 1:29:04.087
It's really good. I'm proud of you.

1:29:07.258 --> 1:29:08.467
-Thank you.
-But. . .

1:29:08.551 --> 1:29:09.509
Here we go.

1:29:09.594 --> 1:29:11.178
. . .you royally screwed up
when it comes to that girl.

1:29:11.262 --> 1:29:15.057
It was a big, stupid mistake. Okay?
The entire marriage was a lie!

1:29:15.141 --> 1:29:17.684
The marriage might have been a mistake,
but it was not a lie.

1:29:17.769 --> 1:29:20.562
And I think that anybody
who has spent time with you two recently

1:29:20.646 --> 1:29:21.730
could tell you that.

1:29:21.814 --> 1:29:25.025
So why don't you get your head
out of your ass

1:29:25.109 --> 1:29:27.277
and go do something about it?

1:29:27.904 --> 1:29:31.281
Or should I tell you not to,
and then maybe you will?

1:29:34.577 --> 1:29:37.245
-TIPPER: She's gone, man.
-Gone? What do you mean, gone?

1:29:37.330 --> 1:29:41.666
She, like, lost it. She quit her job,
shut off her phone. She took off.

1:29:41.918 --> 1:29:43.919
Look, I don't really care much for you,

1:29:44.003 --> 1:29:45.837
and I want to cut your friend Hater.
Seriously.

1:29:45.922 --> 1:29:47.172
But for some reason,

1:29:47.256 --> 1:29:50.217
you're, like, the only man
that Joy can actually be herself with,

1:29:50.301 --> 1:29:54.262
so I wanna tell you where she is,
I really do. I just don't know.

1:29:54.847 --> 1:29:56.848
-What do you know?
-I don't know. If you were miserable

1:29:56.933 --> 1:30:00.435
and you wanted to get happy again,
where would you go?

1:30:02.188 --> 1:30:03.313
What?

1:30:05.024 --> 1:30:06.358
Thank you.

1:30:09.612 --> 1:30:11.947
Okay, tell you what. We both go.

1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:13.448
That way, when she sees us both,

1:30:13.533 --> 1:30:16.076
she can make up her mind
on who she wants to be with.

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:20.038
I've loaned you my band saw,
I've loaned you my beer tap.

1:30:20.123 --> 1:30:21.665
Do you even know
how to drive an automatic?

1:30:21.749 --> 1:30:23.417
The keys. Give me the keys.

1:30:23.501 --> 1:30:24.918
Here. Sorry.

1:30:25.461 --> 1:30:27.838
Go get your future ex-ex-wife.

1:30:27.922 --> 1:30:29.756
(I'M NOT OVER PLAYING)

1:30:37.473 --> 1:30:40.559
What're you doing later?
You like trance music?

1:30:45.523 --> 1:30:49.359
What a waste of time
The thought crossed my mind

1:30:49.444 --> 1:30:52.112
But I never missed a beat

1:30:52.905 --> 1:30:56.992
Can't explain the who or what I was

1:30:57.368 --> 1:30:59.744
Trying to beIieve

1:31:00.288 --> 1:31:01.955
What wouId you do?

1:31:03.875 --> 1:31:07.043
What wouId you do?
Do you know?

1:31:07.378 --> 1:31:11.256
I once had a grip on everything

1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:14.426
It feeIs better to Iet go

1:31:14.510 --> 1:31:16.553
I'm not over

1:31:18.389 --> 1:31:21.975
I'm not over you just yet

1:31:22.059 --> 1:31:24.060
Cannot hide it

1:31:25.730 --> 1:31:29.232
You're not that easy to forget

1:31:29.609 --> 1:31:38.867
I'm not over

1:32:02.558 --> 1:32:03.934
You found me.

1:32:05.937 --> 1:32:07.729
You left this behind,

1:32:08.940 --> 1:32:12.817
and I wanted to bring it back to you.

1:32:18.282 --> 1:32:22.160
Do you know how many lighthouses
there are 30 miles east of the city?

1:32:22.245 --> 1:32:23.995
-How many?
-Five.

1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:26.957
-Really?
-Yeah, just in case you're wondering.

1:32:27.041 --> 1:32:28.083
So.

1:32:29.293 --> 1:32:34.839
Did you come all the way out here
just to give this back to me?

1:32:35.800 --> 1:32:38.510
I did. So I'm going to get out of here.

1:32:41.389 --> 1:32:43.223
All right. Here it is.

1:32:44.183 --> 1:32:46.810
When we were married, I was horrible.

1:32:47.603 --> 1:32:50.230
Sick. Just wrong.

1:32:52.441 --> 1:32:55.026
And it's the best time I've ever had.

1:32:58.698 --> 1:33:01.032
You bet on me, Joy,

1:33:03.661 --> 1:33:06.288
and you made me want to bet on myself.

1:33:06.706 --> 1:33:10.000
So don't think about anyone else

1:33:10.501 --> 1:33:13.503
and just answer this for you.

1:33:22.221 --> 1:33:24.556
Do you want to be married to me?

1:33:25.641 --> 1:33:26.808
Again?

1:33:29.395 --> 1:33:30.687
You know,

1:33:32.023 --> 1:33:35.191
for so long, I've just. . .
I've tried to please everybody.

1:33:35.693 --> 1:33:38.778
And by not trying to please you,

1:33:41.407 --> 1:33:43.658
I think I became myself again.

1:33:46.871 --> 1:33:47.912
I do

1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:52.876
want to be married to you again.

1:34:19.403 --> 1:34:20.862
I quit my job.

1:34:22.073 --> 1:34:23.281
I heard.

1:34:23.532 --> 1:34:26.951
I have absolutely no idea
what I'm going to do. No clue.

1:34:27.078 --> 1:34:31.706
Well, it's a good thing that I have. . .
That we have a ton of money.

1:34:31.791 --> 1:34:33.458
Oh, my God !

1:34:35.211 --> 1:34:38.421
That's right. We hit the jackpot.

1:34:39.173 --> 1:34:40.507
Yeah, I did.

1:34:45.596 --> 1:34:48.515
Now, Joy, do you take this young man

1:34:49.684 --> 1:34:54.270
to be your lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health,

1:34:54.605 --> 1:34:55.605
Uh-huh.

1:34:55.731 --> 1:34:57.774
for richer or for poorer. . .

1:34:58.776 --> 1:35:00.068
I do. I take him.

1:35:00.152 --> 1:35:01.986
WOMAN: Naughty! Naughty!

1:35:02.071 --> 1:35:04.989
Jack, would you put the ring
upon her finger?

1:35:05.908 --> 1:35:08.368
-Was that the one?
-That was it! Oh, my God !

1:35:08.452 --> 1:35:10.245
You may kiss the bride.

-This is the greatest day of my. . .

Oh, my. . .

This is marvelous, simply marvelous.

-Bye! Thank you !
-Bye-bye.

1:35:24.969 --> 1:35:26.678
Have fun, you guys!

1:35:26.762 --> 1:35:28.388
It's so much fun in there!
You guys are gonna love it!

1:35:28.472 --> 1:35:30.557

-Holy shit.

1:35:30.641 --> 1:35:32.684
-JACK: Woman !
-I'm coming !
