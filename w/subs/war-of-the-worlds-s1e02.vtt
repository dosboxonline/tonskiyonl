00:49.320 --> 00:52.560
If I just can get my
fingers through...

00:55.920 --> 00:57.293
<i>When you got here last night.</i>

00:57.318 --> 00:59.824
<i>Did you use the stairs,
or the elevator?</i>

01:00.320 --> 01:02.520
The stairs.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.320
<i>- You must have seen Chris.</i>
- Why would I see him?

01:06.440 --> 01:07.713
<i>He went to the stairwell.</i>

01:07.738 --> 01:11.504
<i>To check the fuse box when the light
went out. You would have passed him.</i>

01:11.600 --> 01:13.960
He..he wasn't there.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.240
Come on, you son of a bitch.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.720
<i>Is it over?</i>

01:51.640 --> 01:53.700
<i>What can you see, Bill?</i>

02:01.025 --> 02:02.144
<i>Bill?</i>

02:05.680 --> 02:08.759
There's bodies in the street.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.360
<i>- Is it Chris?</i>
- No, I don't think so.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.080
<i>Is it safe? Help me out.</i>

02:45.560 --> 02:49.080
- Who was that?
- Nothing. Just a man.

02:54.280 --> 02:59.560
- You think Dad is dead?
- No, I'm sure he's fine.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.520
How long are we gonna stay in here?

03:06.680 --> 03:08.640
Until it's safe.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.121
<i>Where have you been?</i>

03:49.146 --> 03:52.064
I was looking for some rope.
Couldn't find any.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.760
Just get me out of here.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.120
Doctor Durand, It's not safe outside,
we don't know if it's over..

04:15.240 --> 04:17.196
She's out there somewhere.
I'm going to find her.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.459
Doctor Durand.

04:18.485 --> 04:20.824
I know where she was when
the attack happened. I'll walk.

04:20.849 --> 04:22.347
- Doctor Durand.
- I have to find her.

04:22.372 --> 04:23.840
Listen to me!

04:24.160 --> 04:29.136
If your sister is dead, I'm sorry.
Then we can no longer help her.

04:29.160 --> 04:34.760
But suppose she's alive,
where could she be?

04:34.880 --> 04:39.760
- She was on her way here.
- You have to wait here for her.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.000
Come.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.160
He must have tried to help her.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.201
Oh, my darling.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.420
Is it safe?

05:47.445 --> 05:51.584
I guess people would be
coming back down if it wasn't.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.840
Stay behind me.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.000
How do we know it isn't
gonna happen again?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.080
Don't look.

06:34.920 --> 06:39.160
- What the fuck? What...
- What is it?

06:43.640 --> 06:45.400
Come on.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.000
Everyone's dead already?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.520
Tom come on.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.200
Tom get in the car.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.440
What we gonna do now?

07:20.520 --> 07:23.560
We set it out and were going home,
that's all we should do.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.840
What if it happens again?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.680
Now what?

07:33.320 --> 07:36.840
We'll walk. Get your bags.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.280
Hey... I am talking to you.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.416
- No French.
- English?

08:28.441 --> 08:29.441
Yeah.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.192
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

08:31.517 --> 08:34.823
Have you seen other people?
Alive?

08:34.919 --> 08:36.480
No. Do you?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.990
A few man.

08:39.015 --> 08:43.183
What happened?
Is it like this everywhere?

08:43.280 --> 08:45.059
How would you know man.
There is no phone.

08:45.084 --> 08:46.667
No internet. No radio. Nothing.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.572
Everything has gone to shit.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.730
You sure your OK,
you need anything?

08:50.755 --> 08:51.624
No.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.240
Fred, give a bottle.

09:04.140 --> 09:05.190
Thanks.

09:05.615 --> 09:09.264
You have somewhere to go?
You can stay with us.

09:10.160 --> 09:14.320
- I have to find my family.
- Were? In France?

09:14.440 --> 09:17.620
London.
I wanna go through the channel tunnel.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.960
Might not be as bad there.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.200
Take good care of yourself

09:30.320 --> 09:36.120
The number of survivors is unknown.
Above ground there is no electricity.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.960
All the equipment that we were
able to secure works perfectly.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.880
We prepare the generator.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.995
And? Do you hear
something on the radio?

09:51.020 --> 09:53.750
No nothing. At no frequency.

09:53.775 --> 09:57.624
Even the emergency
transmitter does not work.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.200
Keep searching.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.360
Do you want to bury him?

10:17.960 --> 10:19.800
Where?

10:22.840 --> 10:24.840
In the park.

10:27.320 --> 10:31.160
- Do you think Dan is dead?
- No.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.040
You don't know.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.680
If he was in the bunker,
he should be safe.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.040
- What are you doing?
- I have to find Dan.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.720
- Okay, I'll come with you.
- I don't want you too.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.373
He is my son too.

11:14.398 --> 11:17.224
You think that I don't love him.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.160
- Helen please.
- Why are you even here?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.920
You're gonna need some food.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.720
You can't wear those shoes.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.270
Go on there new.

12:53.295 --> 12:56.984
Chris was gonna take up jogging
and he never got around too it.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.480
I don't want you holding me
up and winding about blisters.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.240
I'll wait for you downstairs.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.200
Where are you going?

13:48.320 --> 13:51.160
Check the installations.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.040
The satellites.
It was allowed by the colonel.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.960
Okay, go.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.920
Is everything alright?

14:01.600 --> 14:04.440
I am thinking of my family.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.680
Colonel, Listen...

14:48.720 --> 14:51.560
Which channel is this?

14:51.680 --> 14:55.280
It's not one of us.
We do not use this frequency.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.080
Where is it from?

15:01.120 --> 15:05.080
Somewhere North East of us.

15:05.200 --> 15:10.240
I don't know exactly.
I've never heard anything like this.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.400
Is it extraterrestrial?

15:13.840 --> 15:18.920
I do not know.
Maybe they are already here.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.280
Where's Doctor Durand?

16:02.240 --> 16:05.960
- Let's go.
- The dog...

16:07.400 --> 16:11.240
- The pulse didn't kill the dog?
- So?

16:11.360 --> 16:13.640
That's interesting.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.080
What are you doing?

16:31.105 --> 16:34.704
Just in case the dog needs to get out,
if he's hungry.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.920
What the fuck do you think your doing?

17:52.040 --> 17:53.835
Sorry, I will not hurt you,

17:53.860 --> 17:56.584
I'm just trying to
get food. I'm not...

17:56.680 --> 17:58.560
- Is that a gun?
- Oh no... no...

18:37.440 --> 18:40.880
- As if they are watching us.
- Don't look at them.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.912
What do we do now, anyway?

18:46.937 --> 18:49.852
I thought we'll see the...
either East or...

18:49.877 --> 18:52.945
the Army or someone
and they can tell us what to do

18:52.970 --> 18:54.404
Maybe there all dead too?

18:57.760 --> 18:59.800
I'm hungry.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.280
Okay,
then we'll find somewhere to eat.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.920
- What is it?
- Can't you hear it roar?

19:11.040 --> 19:13.440
It's that sound again.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.480
I can't hear anything. Come on,
let's go.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.600
Do we still have to pay for stuff?

20:33.625 --> 20:35.864
I guess we just help ourselves.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.800
Get proper stuff, healthy stuff.
proper food.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.200
What is it?

20:54.320 --> 20:57.240
Two dead guy's.
It think they shot each other.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.440
Let's just get what we need and go.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.280
Help. Help me.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.480
Please. Just help me please.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.093
What is going on?

21:18.118 --> 21:20.664
Please I need a doctor.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.370
Hey, there are some
people maybe they can help.

21:23.395 --> 21:24.964
- Hey! Hey...
- Tom, tom. Wait.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.111
Emily, come on. Tom!

21:27.136 --> 21:29.624
Someone's hurt!
We need help! Hey!

21:29.720 --> 21:31.600
Tom, wait!

21:33.800 --> 21:35.280
Why didn't they stop?

21:35.400 --> 21:39.440
Because they are looking after themselves,
like we need to.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.976
- Do you want to leave him?
- No, I don't want to leave him but...

21:42.000 --> 21:43.371
If we leave him
he's going to die.

21:43.396 --> 21:46.444
Even if we could find a doctor do you
think they gonna drop everything and...

21:46.540 --> 21:49.656
- We can at least try.
- I don't care about him.

21:49.680 --> 21:53.360
I care about you and Emily.
That's all I care about.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.160
Why are you being like this?

22:08.080 --> 22:09.920
Are you okay?

22:11.640 --> 22:14.426
Can I get you anything?

22:14.451 --> 22:16.304
- Water.
- Water.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.985
Can you show me were that is?

22:20.010 --> 22:22.304
In front of you.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.794
Lower.Lower.

22:27.019 --> 22:28.064
Yes.Yes.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.960
Can't you come closer.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.280
What happened?

22:50.305 --> 22:54.504
I was just getting food and water.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.189
He stabbed me.
I didn't mean to kill him.

22:57.214 --> 22:58.504
It's okay. Okay.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.191
We get help.

23:01.716 --> 23:04.204
How bad is it?

23:13.400 --> 23:17.080
- I lost a lot of blood.
- It's fine.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.320
My mum will be getting help.
Yeah.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.480
All those dead people...
What happened?

23:26.600 --> 23:29.200
There was a attack.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.908
Is it like this everywhere?

23:31.933 --> 23:34.904
I don't know? I think so.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.320
Can I talk to you outside?

23:41.440 --> 23:43.840
- What is it?
- Just come outside.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.376
- Why?
<i>- She wants to leave me.</i>

23:47.400 --> 23:48.490
What?

23:49.315 --> 23:50.784
We're not leaving him.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.012
Please. Please don't go.
Stay here...

23:54.037 --> 23:55.944
We can't help you. I'm sorry.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.000
- Emily, we have to go.
- We have to find a doctor.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.600
- There are no doctors.
- You don't know that.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.505
- Please...
- There is nothing we can do.

24:04.630 --> 24:06.124
Please.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.600
Forgive me. I just want
you to find a doctor.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.560
Okay.

24:14.585 --> 24:18.224
- Please don't hurt me.
- Okay, we'll find a doctor.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.073
Can't you just let her go.

24:20.098 --> 24:23.764
No.No.No You find a doctor!
She stays with me!

24:23.860 --> 24:27.813
Please your hand. I swear.
I get her home I promised.

24:27.838 --> 24:30.445
Please let her go.
Please.

24:30.640 --> 24:34.360
Please just let her go.
Please.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.680
- What is going on?
- Go! Just go!

25:36.880 --> 25:38.920
Hello, What's your name?

25:41.880 --> 25:46.160
You do not have to be scared.
I'm Catherine. And you?

25:46.280 --> 25:48.520
Charlotte Fournier.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.760
Where are your parents?

25:52.640 --> 25:59.056
Dad said we had to flee.
I hid in a cave.

25:59.080 --> 26:03.080
I can't find them anywhere.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.800
- Where do you live?
- In Grenoble.

26:07.920 --> 26:11.080
I'm also going to Grenoble.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.390
Are you coming?

26:12.415 --> 26:15.984
Then we will look for
your parents together.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.880
Who is Sophia?

26:25.000 --> 26:31.120
I just heard you all the time
call her name.

26:31.240 --> 26:35.120
- That's my sister.
- Have you lost her too?

26:35.240 --> 26:36.600
Yes.

26:36.720 --> 26:41.040
Maybe she is
with my mum, dad and brother.

26:41.160 --> 26:44.640
They'll take care of her.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.400
I've seen some dead people.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.960
Don't think about that.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.080
Just think of something else.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.600
Be quiet.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.240
What does that mean?

27:07.360 --> 27:08.760
Who is that?

27:08.880 --> 27:12.520
She has lost her parents.
Let her go.

27:14.640 --> 27:20.160
Don't be afraid, they won't hurt you.
These are friends of mine.

27:20.280 --> 27:24.520
- Why did you leave?
- I went looking for my sister.

27:25.800 --> 27:31.280
Her car is there, but she is not there.
Maybe she went back to Grenoble.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.320
I can't let you go.
there may be another attack.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.280
You don't have to come.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.880
Did you want to shoot us?

27:51.800 --> 27:57.000
Okay, we go along, but alone
to see what is going on.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.200
But you follow my orders.

27:59.225 --> 28:03.144
If I want you to continue or stop,
you do that.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.520
- Is that understood?
- Okay.

28:08.880 --> 28:13.200
Move out and be alert.
Eyes front.

28:41.600 --> 28:48.240
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. I'm just curious.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.680
How the Hell did they
know so much about us?

28:51.800 --> 28:55.360
It's like they know more about
us than we know ourselves.

28:55.480 --> 28:59.560
Shouldn't you be asking
WHY they wanna do this to us?

29:00.840 --> 29:03.616
If I favour of the HOW
maybe I can,

29:03.641 --> 29:05.704
understand the WHY.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.960
Maybe there is a connection
between the means and the motive.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.776
This is not a scientific
experiment Bill. Let's go.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.980
Helen. This way.

29:27.080 --> 29:31.200
- You're lost aren't you?
- We're not lost.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.818
Just not sure were
we are exactly.

29:33.843 --> 29:35.664
What's the difference?

29:39.560 --> 29:42.160
That sound come back.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.800
- You must be imagining it.
- Come on.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.431
We're never gonna make it
home tonight before it get's dark.

29:49.456 --> 29:50.804
Let's stay at this hotel.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.120
It's okay.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.820
Do we really have to sleep
in the same bed together?

30:28.040 --> 30:31.120
- Should have got a bigger room.
- I'm sure we'll manage.

30:32.760 --> 30:36.344
Things won't seem really bad if you
let us have pretzels and chocolate for tea

30:36.440 --> 30:39.000
I'll might have just slipped this one.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.920
The guy in the shop...

30:50.920 --> 30:53.400
- You think he's dead yet?
- Probably.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.480
We just uhm..could we
not talk about him please.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.120
You want to eat something now.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.400
I'm not hungry.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.424
- We have movement
- Where?

32:33.520 --> 32:35.760
Near the supermarket.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.760
Maybe she's there too.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.240
Please.

32:52.360 --> 32:55.120
Okay, let's go.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.920
When was the last
time you saw Dan?

33:13.040 --> 33:16.240
- Just before the attack.
- How was he?

33:16.360 --> 33:18.840
He was clergy but all carrying.

33:18.865 --> 33:22.784
Jack was gonna drop
off the rest of his stuff.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.718
Did he tell you
why they broke up?

33:27.743 --> 33:29.884
Jack was seeing someone else.

33:37.080 --> 33:40.585
I never liked that Jack anyway's.
He's a prick.

33:40.610 --> 33:43.504
Dan deserved
something more than that.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.520
We'll find him, Helen. We will.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.239
- Where is everyone?
- spread out.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.120
What's going on?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.640
Lights.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.840
Fuck!

36:24.640 --> 36:27.160
Fuck, it's a trap!

36:32.760 --> 36:35.680
On the roof!
They're on the roof!

37:16.000 --> 37:17.240
Stop shooting!

37:17.265 --> 37:20.984
Only shoot when you see something!
What's on the roof?

37:21.080 --> 37:22.840
No idea.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.920
What is that?

37:40.040 --> 37:41.920
Shh... Be quiet.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.760
Cover me!

37:51.240 --> 37:53.640
Apply pressure to the wound.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.360
Stay with him.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.840
Where's the doctor and the girl?

38:39.800 --> 38:42.320
- Did you see what it was?
- No.

38:42.440 --> 38:46.840
Is everything all right?
Are you hurt? Where's the girl?

40:04.320 --> 40:06.080
Halt.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.360
What the hell was that?

40:38.480 --> 40:40.920
No idea. It's gone.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.640
Don't look.

40:58.120 --> 41:02.400
Sorry. We have to leave.
It's too dangerous here.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.600
We can't leave her.

41:09.720 --> 41:12.840
I have men down.
I have no choice. Wait!

43:01.680 --> 43:03.600
Look what I found in the basement.

43:06.520 --> 43:09.320
We should've tried to find Chris.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.840
If we've got to find him
we would be dead too.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.080
He was a good man.

43:25.920 --> 43:28.365
Did you see him?

43:28.390 --> 43:33.584
No. I already told you that.

43:36.320 --> 43:40.120
I'll never leave him to die.
You know I'll couldn't do that

43:43.160 --> 43:44.260
Sorry.

43:44.785 --> 43:47.284
I just need to get some sleep.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.480
Saaid?

44:25.600 --> 44:26.980
I'm sorry.

44:27.805 --> 44:30.944
We should never have
gone back to the valley.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.440
I gave the order.

44:35.680 --> 44:41.000
- I should have protected her.
- You couldn't have done anything.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.320
Have you seen...

44:49.080 --> 44:51.320
what it was

44:52.640 --> 44:54.640
No.

44:55.800 --> 44:58.680
But it has been waiting for us.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.360
I don't understand. Why?

45:08.280 --> 45:11.360
Maybe they see us as a threat.

45:11.480 --> 45:16.520
- Are they afraid of a little girl?
- Or they want something from us.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.480
They can find resources
on other planets.

45:20.600 --> 45:26.320
Water, minerals, everything they may need.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.040
It is totally illogical.

45:33.240 --> 45:36.120
There has to be some meaning to them.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.960
I'm going to sleep.
