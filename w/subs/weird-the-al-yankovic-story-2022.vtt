00:20.562 --> 00:23.857
<i> Life is like a parody</i>
<i>of your favorite song.</i>

00:23.941 --> 00:26.443
<i>Just when you think</i>
<i>you know all the words,</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:30.739
<i>surprise, you don't know anything.</i>

00:36.203 --> 00:38.038
Clear the way, clear the way!

00:38.121 --> 00:40.165
-Clear!
-Shut that door, please!

00:47.005 --> 00:48.090
Clear!

00:51.593 --> 00:53.762
Dammit. Dammit!

00:57.182 --> 00:58.767
All right, nurse, let's call it.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.646
Time of death: 7:30--

01:04.857 --> 01:07.734
Quick!

01:07.818 --> 01:10.445
I need some paper,
and a number two pencil.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.407
<i> But... maybe</i>
<i>I'm getting a little ahead of myself.</i>

01:18.537 --> 01:21.123
<i>Why don't we start</i>
<i>back at the beginning.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:26.545
<i>All gabardine suits are now 30% off.</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:30.549
<i>Jenkins in to the windup,</i>

01:30.632 --> 01:32.467
<i>and the three-two fastball is in the--</i>

01:33.969 --> 01:35.929
<i>President Nixon is on board Air--</i>

01:42.728 --> 01:47.441
<i>Whoo-whoo-whoo wind up your radio!</i>

01:47.524 --> 01:50.861
<i>It's time for </i>The Dr. Demento Show,

01:50.944 --> 01:56.200
<i>two hours of mad music</i>
<i>and crazy comedy</i>

01:56.283 --> 01:59.203
<i>-from out of the archives...</i>
-Alfy!

01:59.286 --> 02:01.663
What have we told you
about listening to that garbage?

02:01.747 --> 02:05.542
But Mom, it's Dr. Demento.
It's my favorite show in the whole world.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.085
It's going to rot your brain.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.129
You're lucky your father
wasn't here to catch you, mister.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.507
You know how he feels
about that kind of music.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.258
Yes, I know.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.599
All right. Now go on, go get washed up.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.601
Dinner will be ready in a few minutes.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.979
Alfy, aren't you going to ask
your father how his day was?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.773
Um, how was your day, Dad?

03:12.234 --> 03:13.652
What, how was my day?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.447
We had another fatality
down at the factory.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.575
Oh, God, real grisly one this time.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.160
It was that McKinley kid
that started last week.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.204
I kept telling him
to stop messing around

03:24.288 --> 03:28.125
by that industrial shredder,
but he just wouldn't listen.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.835
I would've reached
out and grabbed him,

03:29.918 --> 03:33.630
but I already lost one hand
to that cursed machine.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.719
Well, anyway, there's an opening
down on the factory floor.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.470
Maybe I could pull a few strings

03:40.554 --> 03:42.431
and you could spend the summer
working with your old man.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.932
How's that sound?

03:44.016 --> 03:46.143
Um, no, thank you.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.644
"No, thank you."

03:47.728 --> 03:49.646
Well, you're gonna have to learn
sooner or later,

03:49.730 --> 03:53.233
that factory, that factory
will make a man outta you.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.737
But I don't wanna work at the factory.
I wanna make songs.

03:56.820 --> 04:02.117
What? You wanna make songs?
Did you hear that, Mary?

04:02.201 --> 04:04.995
We got a regular Bing Crosby
on our hands, don't we?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.705
Nick, you're embarrassing him.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.042
Oh, am I? Why don't you
sing us a little ditty, Bing, huh?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.961
Such a little songbird.
Sing one for us.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.106
Stop, stop! What in God's name
are you doing?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.942
Those aren't the right words.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.653
I know. I made 'em better.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.822
By changing the lyrics
to a well-known song?

04:40.906 --> 04:44.076
No, boy, what you're doing
is confusing and evil.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.577
My God, and I will not have

04:45.661 --> 04:48.163
that kind of blasphemy
in my own home.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.790
But Dad...

04:49.873 --> 04:52.084
What has gotten
into you, Alfred?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.545
Hmm? With the songs and
the crazy magazines?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.506
That is all gonna stop now,
young man!

04:57.589 --> 04:59.383
Honey, I know it's hard to hear this,

04:59.466 --> 05:03.095
but your dad and I had a long talk

05:03.178 --> 05:06.306
and we agreed it would be best
for all of us

05:06.390 --> 05:10.686
if you would just stop being who you are
and doing the things you love.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.231
You don't understand me!

05:21.697 --> 05:23.323
<i>It was a few weeks later</i>

05:23.407 --> 05:25.701
<i>when a mysterious stranger</i>
<i>showed up at my door</i>

05:25.784 --> 05:29.329
<i>and changed my life forever.</i>

05:31.582 --> 05:33.292
Alfy, get the door.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.755
Why, good afternoon, sir.
The gentleman of the house, I take it?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.592
Well, congratulations.
Today is your lucky day.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.095
How would you like to be
the envy of all of your friends

05:45.179 --> 05:47.014
and the most popular fellow in town?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.558
Well, everything you
need to make that happen...

05:49.641 --> 05:51.560
is right here in this box.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.150
Um, my dad is actually...

05:58.233 --> 06:00.861
-Voila.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.362
Feast your eyes.

06:04.239 --> 06:09.995
Have you ever seen
such a gorgeous instrument?

06:12.831 --> 06:15.584
Better yet, try it on.

06:19.296 --> 06:23.175
Son, when you play the accordion,
you are a one-man band.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.844
You are the life of every party.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.598
Go ahead, son, tickle those ivories.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.064
A natural talent.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.859
Son, you cannot squander that.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.654
You have got to buy this beauty,
and I guarantee it,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.156
you are gonna have girls
lined up around the corner.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.699
You're gonna need a lifeguard

06:47.783 --> 06:49.368
because you're gonna be drowning

06:49.451 --> 06:52.996
-in so much p--
-Hey! What's going on?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.082
And hello to you, sir.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.959
What are you doing in my house?

06:57.042 --> 07:00.879
And why is my innocent young child
wearing that devil's squeeze box?

07:00.963 --> 07:02.089
That's actually our newest--

07:02.172 --> 07:03.924
I thought I told you to shut up!

07:06.301 --> 07:08.345
I don't remember you telling me
to shut up before,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.472
but if you're telling me now,
I will gladly--

07:15.227 --> 07:16.728
Dad!

07:16.812 --> 07:19.398
-Ah!

07:23.527 --> 07:25.487
Dad, stop! You're killing him!

07:26.613 --> 07:28.115
Nick? Oh, Nick, oh, Nick!

07:28.198 --> 07:31.493
No, Nick! Hey!
Nicky, stop it right now!

07:31.577 --> 07:33.453
You made me do this, boy.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.206
You brought this evil into the house.
And now look at you.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.958
Look at you.

07:38.041 --> 07:42.421
Take that devilish monstrosity off
this very instant.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.673
I don't wanna see you
ever wearing it again!

07:44.756 --> 07:47.176
Nick, why don't you go
take a little walk?

07:47.259 --> 07:49.136
I think you'd better cool off.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.930
-Yeah. Yeah.

07:52.014 --> 07:55.642
I could use some fresh air
because it stinks in here.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.739
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

08:08.822 --> 08:13.243
I'll be right here.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.247
Mister, I'm so sorry about this.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.083
My husband, he just has
a little bit of a temper,

08:20.167 --> 08:23.837
but he is a good man and
he means well, but anyway,

08:23.921 --> 08:25.964
if you're amenable to it,

08:26.048 --> 08:28.759
we'd like to buy that accordion.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.719
Mom! You mean it?

08:30.802 --> 08:32.971
How do you feel about
an early Christmas present?

08:33.055 --> 08:37.476
Yes! This is the best thing ever!
Thank you so much!

08:39.311 --> 08:40.646
There's just one thing.

08:44.650 --> 08:50.155
No one can see you playing it,
especially your father.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.325
This is our secret.
Do you understand me?

08:55.661 --> 09:00.749
Mom... does Dad hate me?

09:00.832 --> 09:04.962
No, of course not, sweetie.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.215
Then why is he always
so hard on me?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.553
Listen, you're too young
to understand now,

09:12.636 --> 09:16.723
but just trust me,
your father has his reasons.

09:16.807 --> 09:20.644
I think I have
a collapsed lung.

09:20.727 --> 09:25.357
We're trying to have
a conversation here, sir.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.860
<i> For the next few years</i>
<i>I kept to myself,</i>

09:27.943 --> 09:30.445
<i>and tried my best</i>
<i>to please Mom and Dad,</i>

09:30.529 --> 09:34.157
<i>but deep down,</i>
<i>I felt like I was living a lie.</i>

09:34.241 --> 09:37.327
<i>Sure. I was well-behaved,</i>
<i>I got good grades,</i>

09:37.411 --> 09:41.373
<i>but I never let anyone know</i>
<i>the real me.</i>

09:41.456 --> 09:45.419
Hey, Yankovic, you going to that party
at Hofstadter’s tonight?

09:45.502 --> 09:48.922
-His parents are out of town.
-Ah, geez, guys, I don't know.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.049
I'm not really allowed to go to parties.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.927
You don't need to have
your parents' permission. Just sneak out.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.596
I-I don't think I can.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.973
My mom always tucks me in
in case I have night terrors.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.516
You have night terrors?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.727
No, I-- You know, just in case.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.646
Well, just use a hay boy, then.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.191
A hay boy? What's that?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.484
-You don't know what a hay boy is?

10:09.568 --> 10:11.945
Oh, dude, you've got a lot to learn.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.365
Just let us handle everything.
We'll pick you up tonight.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.327
Okay, yeah.

10:21.121 --> 10:25.167
Night-night, Alfy. Don't let the bed bugs
give you night terrors.

10:43.310 --> 10:47.064
I mean, Myron Floren is great and all,
Lawrence Welk sure likes him,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.983
but he's way too overexposed.

10:50.067 --> 10:53.779
For my money,
it's Whoopee John Wilfahrt

10:53.862 --> 10:56.490
that really gets me just
hoppin' and steppin'.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.493
I'm all about that Minnesota sound, man.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.411
Look what I found!

11:01.495 --> 11:05.040
Hey, hey! Hey, you didn't tell me
that this was gonna be a polka party.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.043
-What, do you not like polka?
-No, I like it, it's--

11:08.126 --> 11:11.046
My parents would kill me
if they knew I was here, okay?

11:11.129 --> 11:14.258
I'm so, so sorry, guys. I-I-I gotta go.
I can't-- I can't be here, man.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.427
Come on, Al. Live a little!
What's the worse that could happen?

11:17.511 --> 11:21.181
You might actually let your guard down
and enjoy your life for once?

11:26.562 --> 11:29.690
Yeah, yeah, I can...
let my guard down.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.322
Hey... and sorry.

11:40.242 --> 11:43.912
Hey, everybody, look what I found!

11:46.164 --> 11:48.458
Dude, pass it here. Pass it.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.967
-Okay, dude. Okay.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.427
Al, here. You gotta try this.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.345
Oh, no. No, no, thanks. I'm good.

12:00.429 --> 12:01.930
Al's afraid his mommy and daddy

12:02.014 --> 12:03.849
are gonna find out
he tried an accordion.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.228
I just don't wanna play, okay?
Just, just lay off me, man!

12:10.772 --> 12:13.066
No, guys--

12:13.150 --> 12:14.860
-I'm not gonna--

12:19.865 --> 12:22.492
I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm not--

12:24.786 --> 12:28.582
Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll play, yeah.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.503
-It's the cops! Everyone, run!

13:21.260 --> 13:23.387
I'm sorry to disturb you, ma'am,

13:23.470 --> 13:27.891
but I'm afraid we found your son
at a polka party.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.893
He was playing an accordion.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.521
That's impossible. Alfy's in--

13:32.604 --> 13:36.984
A hay boy?! Really?

13:37.067 --> 13:39.987
What did I do to deserve this,
huh? Huh?

13:40.070 --> 13:42.155
It's like I don't even
know you anymore, Al.

13:42.239 --> 13:45.200
You want me to be like you.
Look at me, I'm nothing like you.

13:45.284 --> 13:46.743
You want me to work that factory.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.246
Okay, I don't even know
what you make down there.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.747
You just call it the factory.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.624
You will find out what we make
at the factory

13:52.708 --> 13:54.084
when you work at the factory!

13:54.168 --> 13:57.713
Well, it's my life,
and I wanna make music

13:57.796 --> 13:59.423
and I wanna play the accordion.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.924
Ah, hogwash!

14:01.008 --> 14:05.387
And I'm good. I'm really, really good!

14:05.470 --> 14:08.473
How did you get good
at playing the accordion, huh? Huh?

14:08.557 --> 14:10.642
It certainly wasn't
under my roof, was it?

14:10.726 --> 14:13.395
What'd you do, sneak out
and practice in the woods

14:13.478 --> 14:14.855
in the middle of the night?

14:14.938 --> 14:19.026
No. I played it here, quietly.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.571
Yeah, I play in the closet.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.701
But I'm not a closet accordion player
anymore.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.494
It feels good!

14:33.624 --> 14:35.375
The closet, you say?

14:38.754 --> 14:40.339
Hmm...

14:40.422 --> 14:42.716
No-no-no. Dad, Dad, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, Dad.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.801
No-no-no. You're not going--
It's not in there.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.386
You're not gonna find anything in there.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.472
Dad, what are you doing?
No, no, Dad-- No-no-no-no--

14:48.555 --> 14:50.057
Dad, no. Dad, please.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.141
-Uh-huh?
-Stop, stop.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.684
-Boy.
-Stop. Stop it.

14:52.768 --> 14:55.479
-Boy, this...
-Please, Dad. Please! No-no-no!

14:55.562 --> 14:56.980
This is for your own good, boy.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.899
No, I need this, I need this--

15:03.278 --> 15:04.947
Nooo!

15:06.698 --> 15:09.368
No, no, no, no, no!

15:09.451 --> 15:12.496
You-- You think you're gonna stop me
from playing?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.915
You'll see.
One day I'm gonna be the best--

15:14.998 --> 15:17.543
Well, perhaps not technically the best,

15:17.626 --> 15:20.879
but arguably the most
famous accordion player

15:20.963 --> 15:24.091
in an extremely specific genre of music.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.425
I'll show you.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.262
I'll show everybody!

15:29.346 --> 15:30.514
Get out!

15:33.433 --> 15:35.018
-Good riddance!

15:42.526 --> 15:46.196
<i> Things at home</i>
<i>never got any better after that.</i>

15:46.280 --> 15:48.615
<i>But within a few years, I graduated</i>

15:48.699 --> 15:51.994
<i>and I was able to move out</i>
<i>and live on my own.</i>

15:52.077 --> 15:54.788
<i>Well, with three other guys</i>
<i>in a dirt-cheap apartment,</i>

15:54.872 --> 15:58.750
<i>but the point is, I didn't</i>
<i>have to answer to anybody.</i>

15:58.834 --> 16:00.836
-Hey, hey.
-Howdy.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.046
<i> Now I'd have a chance</i>
<i>to find others</i>

16:03.130 --> 16:05.757
<i>who would truly understand me.</i>

16:05.841 --> 16:08.760
<i>I could find my people.</i>

16:26.028 --> 16:27.529
-Okay.

16:30.282 --> 16:33.577
-Okay, that's enough. Thanks.
-Mm.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.831
Yeah. Very... very interesting.

16:37.915 --> 16:40.792
So... we'll let you know, okay?

16:40.876 --> 16:45.339
Great. Um, when?

16:45.422 --> 16:47.382
Right now. You didn't make it.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.476
This sucks.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.687
It's the fifth audition
I've been kicked out of this week.

17:00.771 --> 17:04.316
It's almost like nobody wants
an accordion player in their band.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.109
That just doesn't make any sense.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.986
Yeah. Accordions are cool.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.322
That's the problem
with being on the bleeding edge.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.574
You gotta wait for the rest of the world
to catch up with you.

17:12.658 --> 17:14.743
I don't have time to wait.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.870
If nobody wants to have me
in their group,

17:16.954 --> 17:18.872
I'm just gonna have
to go it in on my own.

17:18.956 --> 17:20.791
Don't worry,
it's gonna happen for you.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.960
You just gotta hang in there.
We got your back.

17:23.043 --> 17:26.255
Thanks, Bermuda. All you guys.
You've just been so great.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.048
You really get me.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.342
It is such a difference after living
with my folks for so long.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.470
Yeah. And you know, the best part
of moving away from home

17:33.554 --> 17:36.849
is you can do anything you want.
Hook up with girls...

17:36.932 --> 17:38.475
Get high all the time.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.270
Yeah, I mean, literally anything.
There are no rules.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.938
Just last night, I was driving

17:43.021 --> 17:45.732
down the wrong side of the 101
with my eyes closed,

17:45.816 --> 17:48.443
not knowing whether I was
gonna live to see another day

17:48.527 --> 17:52.197
or die in a horrible, fiery wreck.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.615
Suck on that, Mom and Dad.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.576
-Yeah. You get it, Steve.
-You go, Steve.

17:55.659 --> 17:56.869
Oh, wow, Steve.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.328
What about you, Al?

17:58.412 --> 18:00.038
What's something you always
wanted to do,

18:00.122 --> 18:01.456
but you were never allowed to?

18:08.380 --> 18:11.383
Make up new words
to a song that already exists.

18:14.595 --> 18:17.973
-Oh, well, you should do that, then.
-Absolutely.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.560
Yeah. Why don't you do it right now?
Go on. Make up something brilliant.

18:21.643 --> 18:25.898
No, guys, it's not that easy.
I gotta wait for inspiration to strike,

18:25.981 --> 18:29.193
and I'm pretty sure that well dried up
a long time ago.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.361
Oh, well, if you're not
gonna write us a song,

18:31.445 --> 18:33.197
why don't you make us
some sandwiches?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.490
Oh, yeah, dude, I'm starving.

18:35.574 --> 18:38.869
Sandwich! Sandwich! Sandwich!

18:38.952 --> 18:42.623
Okay, okay, okay. Guys, I'm on it.
Jim, you wanna put on some tunes?

18:42.706 --> 18:43.707
Yeah.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.014
Oh, Steve?
This bologna has your name on it.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.474
-Can we?
-Uh, yeah, sure.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.809
Just open up a package of my bologna.

19:29.753 --> 19:33.298
Is this DJ asleep?
The record keeps skipping.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.801
Hey! Wake up.

19:48.397 --> 19:49.731
Al?

19:59.700 --> 20:00.701
You okay?

20:32.608 --> 20:34.151
Where did that come from?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.569
Dude, I've got chills.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.446
I don't know, it just came out of me.

20:37.529 --> 20:40.199
I've never heard anything like that
before in my life.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.533
You have to record that.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.118
Record it? No, come on, guys.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.204
Al, you've got something here.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.999
I don't know if it comes
from God or the devil,

20:49.082 --> 20:52.211
but the world needs to hear it.

20:52.294 --> 20:55.130
No, forget it, guys. I don't have
the money for a recording studio.

20:55.214 --> 20:59.384
I think the bathroom at the bus station
has pretty good acoustics.

21:02.179 --> 21:05.557
Yeah, sounds good in here.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.935
You can put it right there,
that works.

21:58.068 --> 22:01.488
All right. Just mailed the tape off
to Captain Buffoon.

22:01.572 --> 22:05.993
Now, I guess, all I gotta do
is sit back and wait to become famous.

22:06.076 --> 22:09.246
Yeah, I don't think
that's quite how it works, Al.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.291
Nobody becomes famous overnight.
That's a myth.

22:12.374 --> 22:16.461
Sometimes it takes years,
decades of hard work to get noticed.

22:16.545 --> 22:18.630
-What?
-Look, I believe in you.

22:18.714 --> 22:20.799
I know it's gonna
happen for you someday,

22:20.883 --> 22:23.260
but you can't just mail your
tape off to some disc jockey

22:23.343 --> 22:25.304
and expect to instantly become
a sensation.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.639
Man, why can't I catch a break?

22:30.475 --> 22:32.769
<i>Captain Buffoon on your radio dial.</i>

22:32.853 --> 22:34.688
<i>No, I'm not making this up--</i>

22:34.771 --> 22:37.149
<i>I just received this tape</i>
<i>in the mail a few minutes ago,</i>

22:37.232 --> 22:40.527
<i>and what can I say?</i>
<i>It's an instant sensation!</i>

22:40.611 --> 22:43.530
<i>It's already the number one</i>
<i>most-requested song of the week,</i>

22:43.614 --> 22:45.490
<i>and we're playing it all day long.</i>

22:45.574 --> 22:49.953
<i>So, here it is, once again,</i>
<i>Al Yankovic with "My Bologna!"</i>

22:55.209 --> 22:58.003
-Again!

23:04.051 --> 23:05.594
You know what this means, right?

23:05.677 --> 23:08.013
You gotta get yourself a record deal.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.089
I've heard enough.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.803
And what did you think?

23:47.886 --> 23:51.181
Do you know why they call it
the "music business"?

23:51.265 --> 23:53.225
Uh, why?

23:53.308 --> 23:54.476
Because it's a business.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.894
It's a business!

23:55.978 --> 23:57.437
Use your head, kid.

23:57.521 --> 23:59.773
Nobody wants to hear
a parody song

23:59.857 --> 24:02.776
when they can hear the real thing
for the same price.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.444
What's the point?

24:04.528 --> 24:06.613
Yeah, it makes
no financial sense, whatsoever.

24:06.697 --> 24:08.574
Uh, my-my-my song was actually

24:08.657 --> 24:10.576
a-a big hit on
<i>The Captain Buffoon Show.</i>

24:10.659 --> 24:12.536
-Oh!
-What?

24:12.619 --> 24:13.954
Captain Buffoon? Really?

24:14.037 --> 24:15.581
-Yeah.
-Wait, wait.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.624
Captain Buffoon actually
played your song on the radio?

24:17.708 --> 24:19.126
Yeah.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.961
Why didn't you tell us?
This changes everything.

24:21.044 --> 24:24.047
Ben, get this young gentleman
a record contract this very instant.

24:24.131 --> 24:26.508
We are gonna sign him
to a 14-album deal.

24:26.592 --> 24:27.801
Wait, really?

24:27.885 --> 24:30.512
No! What do you think I am,
an idiot?

24:30.596 --> 24:32.806
-He's not an idiot!
-I'm not an idiot!

24:32.890 --> 24:35.184
-If I may interject here.
-Please.

24:35.267 --> 24:37.311
Look, I'd just like to say

24:37.394 --> 24:39.521
that you got some nerve
coming in here

24:39.605 --> 24:44.276
and wasting my time and
my brother Tony's time.

24:44.359 --> 24:48.864
I'm gonna remember your name
because you, Al Yankovic,

24:48.947 --> 24:52.409
are the most untalented, pathetic loser

24:52.492 --> 24:55.454
that I've ever met in my entire life.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.164
Okay, um, maybe--

24:57.247 --> 25:02.419
You're nothing but a hack,
a stupid, useless parasite,

25:02.503 --> 25:05.714
-and you're so ugly.
-Okay...

25:05.797 --> 25:09.885
That ridiculous hair,
that horrible mustache,

25:09.968 --> 25:11.803
stupid glasses.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.180
You make me wanna throw up!

25:13.263 --> 25:14.890
All right, thank you.
Thank you, Ben.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.767
Thank you, Ben, for your,
for your thoughts.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.352
-Thank you.
-Jeez.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.145
-Ugh.
-Look, kid,

25:20.229 --> 25:24.441
if you really have your heart set
on doing this stupid music,

25:24.525 --> 25:26.652
maybe write more than one song.

25:26.735 --> 25:30.656
Yeah, all the biggest musical acts
have more than one song in their catalog.

25:30.739 --> 25:32.115
That's very true.

25:32.199 --> 25:34.076
And also, get out
in front of a live audience.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.786
Any audience, any stage,

25:35.869 --> 25:38.956
just get out there, build up your chops,
and who knows?

25:39.039 --> 25:42.584
Maybe someday... we'll talk again.

25:42.668 --> 25:45.671
But don't count on it
because you truly suck.

25:45.754 --> 25:46.713
Right.

25:46.797 --> 25:47.965
Okay.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.565
Thank you! We are Skunk Barf!

26:04.648 --> 26:08.694
-You guys suck!

26:15.784 --> 26:19.037
I can't do this. I can't do this.

26:19.121 --> 26:21.123
Just relax, you'll be great.

26:21.206 --> 26:22.916
Yeah, the new song's a bona fide hit.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.751
It's about ice cream!

26:24.835 --> 26:26.461
Everybody likes ice cream.

26:26.545 --> 26:29.923
This seems like more of
a whiskey and... heroin crowd.

26:30.007 --> 26:33.218
Look, guys, I appreciate you being here
for moral support and everything,

26:33.302 --> 26:36.013
but they are literally gonna kill me.
We need to leave right now.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.223
Don't be silly, man.
They're gonna love you.

26:38.307 --> 26:39.850
All right, we got, uh, most of the blood

26:39.933 --> 26:44.354
cleaned off the stage,
so you're on, now.

26:44.438 --> 26:48.317
-Go start the car.
-Nah, you got this, Al.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.903
This is your moment.
Go get 'em, champ.

26:50.986 --> 26:54.531
-Go get 'em.

27:01.038 --> 27:04.750
All right, all right,
who's ready for some more music?

27:07.044 --> 27:09.296
Okay, uh, coming next to the stage,

27:09.379 --> 27:12.508
it's this guy's first time,
Al Yankovic.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.306
-Hey.

27:19.389 --> 27:20.390
Sorry.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.353
Sorry.

27:24.436 --> 27:27.147
Ah, nice Hawaiian shirt, Trapper John!

27:29.775 --> 27:31.235
Um...

27:36.532 --> 27:37.741
Boo!

27:56.927 --> 27:58.637
This guy needs some help.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.217
Gimme a shot of tequila
and two scoops of rum raisin.

28:37.301 --> 28:38.844
We don't sell ice cream here.

28:38.927 --> 28:41.221
You better start selling it
before this song's over

28:41.305 --> 28:44.057
or you're gonna have a riot
on your hands.

29:38.111 --> 29:40.989
Why didn't you guys tell me
you could play? You're great.

29:41.073 --> 29:43.033
I guess it didn't seem relevant 'til now.

29:43.116 --> 29:46.578
-Thank you!

29:53.752 --> 29:55.045
Oh, hey.

29:56.255 --> 30:00.092
Oh! You're Dr. Demento.

30:00.175 --> 30:03.637
Oh, wow. I, I am such a huge fan.
I can't believe this.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.931
I've been listening to your show
my entire life.

30:06.014 --> 30:08.934
Whoo-whoo-whoo,
wind up your radio--

30:09.017 --> 30:10.310
-Don't do that.
-Sorry.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.354
Um, did you see the show?

30:12.437 --> 30:16.024
I did. And let me
tell you something, kid.

30:16.108 --> 30:18.402
Every once in a great while,
I can spot a talent

30:18.485 --> 30:21.238
that I know is headed
straight to the top.

30:21.321 --> 30:23.073
Nervous Norvus,

30:23.156 --> 30:25.576
Wild Man Fischer,

30:25.659 --> 30:28.662
and now... you.

30:28.745 --> 30:32.457
What I saw you do on that stage
tonight blew my mind!

30:32.541 --> 30:36.086
I'm telling you, you've cracked the code.
You're onto something special.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.796
Wow, I mean, you, you,
you have no idea

30:37.880 --> 30:39.548
what it means
for me to hear you say that.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.593
-Thank you so much.
-Oh...

30:42.676 --> 30:45.554
I only wish the Scotti Brothers
felt the same way.

30:45.637 --> 30:48.015
Ah, those suits.
They couldn't recognize real talent

30:48.098 --> 30:52.060
if it slapped them in the face
with a dead fish.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.980
But I might be able to
get them to notice you.

30:55.063 --> 30:56.356
How?

30:56.440 --> 30:59.151
Well, stick with me, huh?

30:59.234 --> 31:01.820
I know a little something
about the biz.

31:01.904 --> 31:05.657
Uh, wait, are-are you saying
you want to be my mentor?

31:05.741 --> 31:10.913
No, I'm saying I want to be your...
de-mentor!

31:19.254 --> 31:22.466
But first, we gotta find you
a stage name.

31:22.549 --> 31:26.053
I mean, Al Yankovic. Ugh, blech.

31:26.136 --> 31:28.138
Doesn't exactly trip off
the tongue now, does it?

31:28.222 --> 31:29.973
I guess not.

31:30.057 --> 31:32.059
It's so clunky. It's long.
It's ungainly. It's hard to pronounce.

31:32.142 --> 31:33.268
Sorry.

31:33.352 --> 31:35.771
Now, I'm just gonna throw this out there.

31:35.854 --> 31:38.357
Would you be willing
to change your name to...

31:40.234 --> 31:44.738
Weird... Al Yankovic?

31:46.281 --> 31:47.449
I love it.

31:47.533 --> 31:50.911
Great. Great!

31:50.994 --> 31:53.163
Hey, I'm having a little pool party
at the house this weekend.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.165
I'd love to introduce
you to some folks.

31:55.249 --> 31:56.667
What do you say you come on by,

31:56.750 --> 31:58.752
we'll continue this conversation
at the grotto.

31:58.836 --> 32:00.087
Yes, of course!

32:00.170 --> 32:05.050
Mm-hmm. And don't forget to stay demented!

32:06.885 --> 32:07.886
You got it.

32:20.816 --> 32:25.737
H-H-Hey!
There he is, my newest superstar.

32:25.821 --> 32:28.031
Ah, so glad you could make it.

32:28.115 --> 32:29.992
I've been telling everyone about you,

32:30.075 --> 32:32.870
and, uh, looks like you've
brought your band.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.538
Okay, fine.

32:34.621 --> 32:36.707
Uh, there's some canapés right
over there, gentlemen.

32:36.790 --> 32:39.084
Help yourselves. So,
let me show you around, okay?

32:39.168 --> 32:42.171
Everyone's dying to meet you.
Oh, right this way.

32:42.254 --> 32:44.256
-Uh, Mr. Herman.
-Hello.

32:44.339 --> 32:46.133
I'd like you to meet
"Weird Al" Yankovic.

32:46.216 --> 32:48.552
Ah, a rising star.

32:48.635 --> 32:50.179
Pleased to meet you.

32:55.184 --> 32:57.686
And this is, of course, Tiny Tim.

32:57.769 --> 33:03.442
Oh, Mr. Yankovic.
Oh, why, you're just the cat's pajamas.

33:03.525 --> 33:05.319
Is that a good thing?

33:05.402 --> 33:06.528
Sure.

33:06.612 --> 33:08.780
Ah, excuse us, gentlemen.

33:08.864 --> 33:10.657
Nice to meet you.

33:10.741 --> 33:12.951
So that's Demento's new protégé.

33:13.035 --> 33:17.039
You know, I hear they don't even hand out
raincoats and tarps at his shows.

33:17.122 --> 33:18.582
Amateur hour.

33:20.459 --> 33:23.045
Amateur hour.

33:23.128 --> 33:26.632
-Well, hello, Dali.
-Andy.

33:26.715 --> 33:31.220
What do you think of
this "Weird Al" Yankovic?

33:31.303 --> 33:36.433
Dali predicts he will change
everything we know about art!

33:36.517 --> 33:39.895
Weird Al will change the world!

33:39.978 --> 33:43.106
Eh, I give him 15 minutes.

33:43.190 --> 33:47.361
Well, well, well, if it isn't Dr. Demento.

33:47.444 --> 33:50.614
Wolfman Jack.
Who let you in here?

33:50.697 --> 33:53.825
The Wolfman goes where
the Wolfman wants, baby.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.790
Security!

33:59.873 --> 34:03.961
Relax. I just came by
to lay eyes on this cat

34:04.044 --> 34:06.505
you've been paradin' around.

34:06.588 --> 34:08.966
The one who takes
preexisting musical compositions

34:09.049 --> 34:12.511
and completely changes the lyrics.

34:12.594 --> 34:16.557
He has a name, you know.
And it's "Weird Al" Yankovic.

34:16.640 --> 34:20.060
Well then, put 'er there, Weird Al.

34:20.143 --> 34:22.396
Oooh! Too slow.

34:22.479 --> 34:23.897
What is the meaning of this?

34:23.981 --> 34:26.441
This is me telling you
that I know hit talent

34:26.525 --> 34:28.652
when I see it, and this kid ain't it.

34:28.735 --> 34:32.197
He'll never crack the top 40,
he's too niche.

34:32.281 --> 34:37.286
This kid, as you call him,
is the future of music.

34:37.369 --> 34:41.874
Right. Well, if he's so great,
how about he comes up

34:41.957 --> 34:45.460
with a new parody song
right now on the spot?

34:45.544 --> 34:47.296
-Ooh...
-Whoa.

34:47.379 --> 34:50.632
I mean, come on, man. It's a party.
I don't know that's a good idea.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.718
Do "Another One Bites the Dust."

34:52.801 --> 34:56.722
That seems fitting,
who said that?

34:56.805 --> 35:00.100
I did. I'm John Deacon...

35:03.604 --> 35:04.938
of Queen.

35:08.150 --> 35:09.735
I play the bass in Queen.

35:09.818 --> 35:11.486
Oh...

35:11.570 --> 35:13.989
All right, future boy.

35:14.072 --> 35:17.910
Let's hear what you can do
with "Another One Bites the Dust."

35:27.294 --> 35:28.712
We're waiting.

35:30.797 --> 35:33.342
You don't have to
prove anything to him.

35:33.425 --> 35:36.386
Come on, guy from Queen.

35:36.470 --> 35:41.016
Let's go find a party
with some real talent.

35:45.896 --> 35:48.815
Get me my accordion.

35:48.899 --> 35:50.609
Hey, you like deviled eggs?

35:50.692 --> 35:53.529
I love a good deviled egg.
They don't love me, though.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.266
I don't know what to say.

37:47.684 --> 37:49.436
That was the--

37:49.520 --> 37:52.648
That was the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard in my entire life.

37:54.358 --> 37:57.653
You truly have a rare gift, Weird Al.

38:05.953 --> 38:10.040
Hey mate, we're playing
a little gig next week

38:10.123 --> 38:15.254
called Live Aid,
Wembley Stadium.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.548
I'd be honored if you
would join the band

38:17.631 --> 38:20.759
and play that song on stage with us.

38:22.845 --> 38:24.179
What do you say?

38:30.894 --> 38:32.521
Hard pass!

38:40.279 --> 38:43.031
-This guy?
-Get him, get him out of here!

38:47.619 --> 38:50.289
<i> I felt like</i>
<i>I was on top of the world,</i>

38:50.372 --> 38:54.084
<i>but this was just the beginning.</i>

38:56.170 --> 38:59.631
"Weird Al" Yankovic is
one of the most exciting

38:59.715 --> 39:01.967
new artists in pop music today.

39:02.050 --> 39:04.678
His self-titled debut album

39:04.761 --> 39:08.557
<i>was just certified quintuple platinum.</i>

39:10.017 --> 39:12.227
<i>Simply by taking well-known pop songs</i>

39:12.311 --> 39:13.729
<i>and changing the lyrics,</i>

39:13.812 --> 39:16.231
<i>Yankovic has taken the world by storm.</i>

39:16.315 --> 39:19.484
I have never seen a collection
of Hawaiian shirts like this.

39:19.568 --> 39:21.153
<i>Oh, well, thank you, Oprah!</i>

39:21.236 --> 39:23.572
<i> He has the number one album</i>
<i>in 20 countries</i>

39:23.655 --> 39:25.532
<i>and counts among his fans</i>
<i>such luminaries as...</i>

39:25.616 --> 39:27.492
Hey, turn this up.

39:27.576 --> 39:30.204
<i> ...President Ronald Reagan</i>
<i>and Pope John Paul II.</i>

39:30.287 --> 39:33.332
<i>Even international drug lord</i>
<i>Pablo Escobar</i>

39:33.415 --> 39:36.210
<i>calls Weird Al his favorite musician.</i>

39:42.466 --> 39:44.218
And what about this,
this necklace you're wearing?

39:44.301 --> 39:45.761
Oh, these, yeah.

39:45.844 --> 39:47.721
I, uh, I wear one
solid platinum record medallion

39:47.804 --> 39:49.431
for each time my album went platinum.

39:49.515 --> 39:51.850
So that's one, two, three, four, five.

39:51.934 --> 39:53.644
Wow. Those look heavy.

39:53.727 --> 39:55.854
They are super uncomfortable.

39:55.938 --> 39:58.607
<i> And it's not</i>
<i>just the record company</i>

39:58.690 --> 40:01.151
<i>that's cashing in on Weird Al fever.</i>

40:01.235 --> 40:04.905
<i>The artists he's parodying</i>
<i>are experiencing a phenomenon</i>

40:04.988 --> 40:07.699
that's being called the Yankovic Bump.

40:07.783 --> 40:10.953
<i>The Knack, Joan Jett</i>
<i>and even Queen</i>

40:11.036 --> 40:13.830
<i>have seen their</i>
<i>album sales double</i>

40:13.914 --> 40:17.334
<i>after Weird Al put</i>
<i>his unique spin on their songs.</i>

40:17.417 --> 40:21.505
<i>Which begs the question,</i>
<i>who will be next?</i>

40:21.588 --> 40:24.716
Who indeed?

40:24.800 --> 40:29.179
Al, you really do seem to have
the Midas touch.

40:29.263 --> 40:31.807
I've never seen anything like it
in all my years.

40:31.890 --> 40:34.393
Your parents must be proud.

40:34.476 --> 40:37.187
Yeah. Yeah, my parents...

40:46.697 --> 40:48.073
Is everything okay?

40:48.156 --> 40:50.576
Huh? Yeah. Yes, of course.

40:50.659 --> 40:52.995
Yeah, whose, whose parents
wouldn't be proud?

40:53.078 --> 40:54.454
Exactly.

40:56.081 --> 40:59.084
-Al? Al?

41:03.881 --> 41:05.007
Hello?

41:05.090 --> 41:08.886
-<i> Hey, Mom. It's me.</i>
-Alfy?

41:08.969 --> 41:10.929
<i>It's been a long time, hasn't it?</i>

41:13.015 --> 41:14.516
We saw you on the TV.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.019
It's crazy, right?

41:17.102 --> 41:19.188
Yeah, who would've thought?

41:19.271 --> 41:21.690
I'm actually gearing up
for a residency right now

41:21.773 --> 41:23.775
at Madison Square Garden.

41:23.859 --> 41:26.528
Sold out 25 nights in a row.

41:26.612 --> 41:28.363
They're, uh, they're moving the Knicks

41:28.447 --> 41:30.157
to a hockey rink in Jersey
for a month.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.909
-Huh.
<i>-Yep.</i>

41:31.992 --> 41:33.827
<i>Yep. I'm living the dream.</i>

41:33.911 --> 41:36.163
I mean, to have 20,000 people
every night

41:36.246 --> 41:38.373
singing along to my words

41:38.457 --> 41:40.501
to other people's music.

41:40.584 --> 41:43.420
I feel truly alive
when I'm on that stage.

41:43.504 --> 41:44.880
<i> Oh, that's nice.</i>

41:46.298 --> 41:47.591
<i>Are you eating enough bran?</i>

41:49.176 --> 41:51.303
-What?
-Well, it's important.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.764
It keeps you regular
and you know how you get

41:53.847 --> 41:56.225
when you're not having
your regular BMs, Alfy.

41:56.308 --> 41:59.269
I-- Yeah, sure.

41:59.353 --> 42:02.773
Good. That's good.

42:04.149 --> 42:09.071
So, um, so how's Dad?

42:09.154 --> 42:12.574
Gosh, your father's a complicated man.

42:12.658 --> 42:14.743
Does he ever talk about me?

42:14.826 --> 42:17.996
Oh, sure, all the time. Yes.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.249
There's so many things
that he wants to tell you,

42:20.332 --> 42:21.708
but it's just difficult for him.

42:21.792 --> 42:23.794
Well, like what?

42:23.877 --> 42:26.171
You know, what does
he want to tell me?

42:26.255 --> 42:30.884
<i>Well, mostly he just</i>
<i>wants to let you know that</i>

42:30.968 --> 42:33.053
he's definitely not proud of you.

42:34.388 --> 42:35.806
What?

42:35.889 --> 42:37.683
Yes. He told me to be crystal clear
about that.

42:37.766 --> 42:40.352
Also, he still thinks that parody songs
are stupid

42:40.435 --> 42:41.687
and I don't have to tell you

42:41.770 --> 42:43.355
<i>how he feels about the accordion, do I?</i>

42:43.438 --> 42:45.107
Okay. Well, Mom,
I actually have to go now.

42:45.190 --> 42:47.109
You know, he just never
really wanted to have kids.

42:47.192 --> 42:48.902
Okay. Well, great talking to you.

42:48.986 --> 42:51.530
Listen, if you do wanna get
that job down at the factory,

42:51.613 --> 42:53.615
I'm sure your father can
pull a few strings for you.

42:53.699 --> 42:55.117
All right. Take care now, bye-bye.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.785
-Love you, Alfy!
-Yep!

43:08.005 --> 43:11.967
Oh, tough call with the folks, huh?

43:12.050 --> 43:14.803
You know, I can fire up the downstairs
hot tub for you if you'd like.

43:14.887 --> 43:17.181
Oh, no, no, this is fine. I don't want to
put you through any trouble.

43:17.264 --> 43:18.724
I-- It's really no trouble.

43:18.807 --> 43:20.642
I mean, there are actually
three other Jacuzzis

43:20.726 --> 43:22.686
in the house that are
not here in my bedroom.

43:22.769 --> 43:26.106
Oh, that's so sweet of you,
but really, I'm good.

43:26.190 --> 43:29.526
You, on the other hand,
you don't seem so good.

43:29.610 --> 43:31.528
Do you wanna talk about it?

43:35.324 --> 43:38.785
It's just, my whole life,

43:38.869 --> 43:44.416
all I've wanted is for my
father to accept me for who I am.

43:44.499 --> 43:47.669
And I thought if I became
this huge success,

43:47.753 --> 43:49.838
that that would change things, but...

43:49.922 --> 43:51.131
Mm.

43:52.799 --> 43:55.928
But he still hates everything about me.

43:59.181 --> 44:01.975
You know, maybe he's right.
Maybe parody songs are stupid.

44:02.059 --> 44:05.312
Look, you don't have to
write parody songs

44:05.395 --> 44:06.563
if you don't want to.

44:06.647 --> 44:09.024
What?

44:09.107 --> 44:11.235
You look a little hungry.
Here, have a snack.

44:13.570 --> 44:16.281
You can write your own songs.

44:17.950 --> 44:19.535
You think I took
you under my wing

44:19.618 --> 44:22.079
because you write parody songs?

44:22.162 --> 44:25.666
No, I saw in you a visionary,

44:25.749 --> 44:29.586
an artist who has
something to give to the world.

44:29.670 --> 44:31.463
I saw in you something special,

44:31.547 --> 44:34.758
something your father doesn't see

44:34.842 --> 44:37.135
and that even you don't see...

44:39.346 --> 44:40.430
yet.

44:40.514 --> 44:42.266
This guacamole tastes funny.

44:42.349 --> 44:45.853
Of course it does.
It's loaded with LSD.

44:45.936 --> 44:47.104
What?!

44:47.187 --> 44:49.398
-No!

44:49.481 --> 44:53.068
You need to open your heart
and your mind,

44:53.151 --> 44:56.321
face your fears,
break your chains,

44:56.405 --> 44:58.699
come with me on a spiritual journey.

44:58.782 --> 45:00.868
Find your source of inspiration!

45:00.951 --> 45:03.829
No, that-that is totally not cool, man.
You can't just--

45:03.912 --> 45:06.790
Whoa, no, what is happening
to your head?

45:06.874 --> 45:08.625
That's probably the drugs kicking in.

45:08.709 --> 45:10.711
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

45:10.794 --> 45:13.463
It'll be over in like, 10 to 12 hours.

45:13.547 --> 45:17.009
12 hours?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

45:18.886 --> 45:21.430
I'm just gonna close my eyes
and when I open them up again,

45:21.513 --> 45:23.348
everything is gonna
be completely back to--

45:32.357 --> 45:35.527
What in God's name
are you doing, boy?

45:35.611 --> 45:37.404
Those aren't the right words!

45:37.487 --> 45:41.909
Please, just stop being who you are
and doing the things you love.

45:41.992 --> 45:45.662
You, Al Yankovic,
are the most untalented,

45:45.746 --> 45:50.167
pathetic loser I've ever
met in my entire life!

45:50.250 --> 45:52.920
No, no, no, stop it.
Leave me alone!

45:56.173 --> 46:01.136
Alfred Yankovic, this is your time.

46:01.220 --> 46:05.182
Believe in yourself,
and the song will come to you.

46:05.265 --> 46:06.934
Don't listen to him, boy!

46:07.017 --> 46:09.895
You belong with me, at the factory!

46:09.978 --> 46:13.440
It's your destiny!

46:13.524 --> 46:16.902
Aah! No!

46:24.409 --> 46:26.620
Aah! No!

46:26.703 --> 46:30.499
He's losing his power
over you, keep going!

46:30.582 --> 46:32.459
I can't!

46:32.543 --> 46:35.337
Maybe you should try
a little Cap'n Crunch.

46:36.672 --> 46:38.423
What?

46:38.507 --> 46:40.217
Raisin Bran, perhaps?

46:41.760 --> 46:44.346
No, no! I don't want no Cap'n Crunch!

46:44.429 --> 46:46.265
Don't want no Raisin Bran!

46:46.348 --> 46:50.519
Eat it, just eat it.

46:50.602 --> 46:52.813
I don't understand!

46:52.896 --> 46:56.108
Don't you make me repeat it.

46:58.902 --> 47:01.196
What's happening to me?!

47:01.280 --> 47:04.825
Now you must die in order to be reborn.

47:04.908 --> 47:08.120
No, no! No!

47:41.361 --> 47:42.487
Put it in.

47:59.755 --> 48:01.131
I've heard enough.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.136
It's brilliant.

48:06.220 --> 48:08.847
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't recognize the tune.

48:08.931 --> 48:10.933
What song are you parodying here?

48:11.016 --> 48:12.935
I'm not parodying anything.

48:13.018 --> 48:15.062
This song is completely original.

48:15.145 --> 48:18.190
Wait, you wrote the words
and the music?

48:18.273 --> 48:19.316
That's right.

48:19.399 --> 48:22.444
Okay, just to be perfectly clear,

48:22.528 --> 48:26.573
so you're saying this is not a parody
of an existing song,

48:26.657 --> 48:31.495
but an entirely original composition
that you wrote all by yourself?

48:31.578 --> 48:32.913
Yes.

48:32.996 --> 48:35.666
Not based on anybody else's song
in any way?

48:35.749 --> 48:37.209
Did I stutter?

48:40.254 --> 48:43.715
I'm tired of people thinking
I'm some kind of joke, okay?

48:43.799 --> 48:49.847
I am done writing parody songs. Done.

48:49.930 --> 48:55.936
From now on, I am only gonna do
completely original music.

48:56.728 --> 48:59.106
Oh, Al, you can't smoke in here.

49:08.907 --> 49:11.368
I totally deserved that.

49:11.451 --> 49:16.123
Well, I am blown away.
This is a bold new direction.

49:16.206 --> 49:19.001
I mean, the parody songs were fine,

49:19.084 --> 49:24.256
but you've completely
changed the game here.

49:24.339 --> 49:26.550
This is gonna be your biggest hit yet.

49:30.929 --> 49:35.309
Okay, okay! Hold your horses!

49:47.029 --> 49:48.739
"Weird Al" Yankovic.

49:48.822 --> 49:51.992
Um, do I know you?

49:52.075 --> 49:55.746
Madonna. Ring any bells?

49:55.829 --> 49:59.416
Oh, right. Madonna.

49:59.499 --> 50:03.629
Yeah, "Lucky Star,"
"Holiday," "Borderline."

50:03.712 --> 50:05.380
Born in Michigan, Catholic schoolgirl,

50:05.464 --> 50:07.299
dropped outta college
and moved to New York City

50:07.382 --> 50:09.134
with nothing but the clothes
on your back

50:09.218 --> 50:10.511
and $35 in your pocket.

50:10.594 --> 50:13.013
Maybe it was to become
the Queen of Pop.

50:13.096 --> 50:15.974
Maybe it was to get back at Dad
for marrying the housekeeper.

50:17.309 --> 50:18.769
Wow.

50:18.852 --> 50:21.146
You know a lot more about me
than you let on.

50:21.230 --> 50:25.400
What can I say?
I'm full of surprises.

50:27.945 --> 50:31.949
So, what brings you here, Madonna?

50:32.032 --> 50:34.034
Oh, I was in the neighborhood.

50:34.117 --> 50:39.581
Wanted to see if my map to
the stars' homes was accurate.

50:39.665 --> 50:42.459
Guess you won't need a refund then.

50:42.543 --> 50:46.463
Is that, uh, all you wanted?

50:46.547 --> 50:51.677
No, I want a lot of things,

50:51.760 --> 50:54.179
but the truth is,
I'm a big fan of yours.

50:54.263 --> 50:56.890
Join the club.

50:56.974 --> 51:01.144
Have you heard my new
single, "Like a Virgin?"

51:01.228 --> 51:02.646
Oh, I've heard it.

51:02.729 --> 51:08.110
And I'm curious,
is that song autobiographical?

51:08.193 --> 51:11.530
Yes. I technically am a virgin,

51:11.613 --> 51:14.825
except for the fact
that I've had a lot of sex.

51:14.908 --> 51:17.327
I mean, a lot.

51:19.037 --> 51:20.998
I see.

51:21.081 --> 51:24.126
Anyway, I was wondering

51:24.209 --> 51:26.295
if you were going to
do a parody of my song.

51:27.963 --> 51:29.381
Maybe.

51:29.464 --> 51:32.050
I like that.

51:32.134 --> 51:36.388
So, would you like to see
the rest of the house?

51:36.471 --> 51:38.765
There's only one room
I'm interested in seeing.

51:38.849 --> 51:40.809
Oh, I'm doing some
work on the bathroom,

51:40.893 --> 51:43.061
but there's another one downstairs.

51:43.145 --> 51:45.272
Oh, I'm not talking about the bathroom.

51:45.355 --> 51:48.650
Then let me show you
to the laundry room.

51:50.402 --> 51:54.489
Al Yankovic,
are you playing with me?

51:56.283 --> 51:57.784
Yes?

52:20.933 --> 52:23.852
Oh, you're so weird.

52:41.370 --> 52:44.706
So, are we like, boyfriend
and girlfriend now?

52:46.500 --> 52:49.920
Maybe.

52:50.003 --> 52:53.590
Well, now that things are official,

52:53.674 --> 52:56.927
I should really be honest with you.

52:57.010 --> 53:01.723
When I said I might parody
one of your songs, I lied.

53:05.185 --> 53:10.732
So, it's true, what they're saying.
You're not doing parodies anymore.

53:11.275 --> 53:15.279
My song "Eat It," which, as you know,
is a hundred percent original,

53:15.362 --> 53:18.824
is the biggest hit by anybody ever.

53:18.907 --> 53:21.368
So, I've decided that's all
I wanna do from now on.

53:21.451 --> 53:23.829
Completely original songs.

53:27.875 --> 53:30.919
See, that's what I love about you.

53:31.003 --> 53:34.089
You know what you want and
you know how to get it.

53:36.258 --> 53:37.467
Just like me.

54:07.915 --> 54:12.544
How about that?
And I've got some amazing news.

54:12.628 --> 54:15.422
I've officially gotten the word
that we have broken

54:15.506 --> 54:19.635
the Beatles' record for most singles
in the Billboard Top 10.

54:20.677 --> 54:21.845
Oh.

54:25.641 --> 54:27.226
Yeah, cool.

54:27.309 --> 54:28.936
Uh, okay.

54:29.019 --> 54:33.649
Well, um, we have some very
exciting offers pouring in

54:33.732 --> 54:36.193
that I would love to--

54:36.276 --> 54:38.278
-That--
-Oh, that feels good.

54:38.362 --> 54:39.905
love to discuss with--

54:39.988 --> 54:41.240
Love to discuss with you.

54:41.323 --> 54:43.075
We got some, some great calls.

54:43.158 --> 54:45.202
-Uh, very interesting.

54:45.285 --> 54:48.956
Led Zeppelin, uh, is thinking about
getting back together,

54:49.039 --> 54:51.041
but they say the only
way they'll do it

54:51.124 --> 54:53.085
is if they can open
up for you on tour.

54:53.168 --> 54:55.045
I mean, that's sweet, but yeah.

54:55.128 --> 54:57.840
I already offered the gig
to Howie Mandel, so.

54:59.424 --> 55:02.719
Okay, yeah. But this is perhaps--

55:02.803 --> 55:07.808
Look, I am not bumping
Mandel for Zeppelin, okay? Pass.

55:07.891 --> 55:10.394
Okay. Got it.

55:12.145 --> 55:15.607
Uh, well, we have another offer,
a very serious offer.

55:15.691 --> 55:19.653
This is to replace Roger Moore
in the James Bond franchise.

55:19.736 --> 55:21.154
-Now this one--
-No!

55:21.238 --> 55:23.073
No, no, no, I'm not gonna
be the new James Bond.

55:23.156 --> 55:25.075
I'm not gonna be
the new Indiana Jones.

55:25.158 --> 55:28.912
From now on, everything I do
has to be completely original.

55:28.996 --> 55:31.039
How many times have
I gotta say that?

55:31.123 --> 55:34.918
Look, Mr. Pimento,
we have places to be.

55:35.002 --> 55:37.129
How long is this gonna take?

55:37.212 --> 55:39.715
Not much longer.

55:39.798 --> 55:41.341
We got another offer
for you to play

55:41.425 --> 55:43.719
Pablo Escobar's 40th birthday party.

55:43.802 --> 55:45.762
I saw him on the news.
He's a really big deal.

55:45.846 --> 55:48.515
The drug lord?
Why is he so obsessed with me?

55:48.599 --> 55:53.478
And he has upped his offer
to three billion pesos.

55:53.562 --> 55:55.522
I mean, okay, how much is
that in American money?

55:55.606 --> 55:58.233
You know what, never mind,
I don't feel like doing the math.

55:58.317 --> 56:00.194
Well, I've done the math
and I can assure you--

56:00.277 --> 56:05.908
Bup-bup-bup! I can do my own math,
and I said, I don't want to. Pass.

56:05.991 --> 56:09.036
Alfy, are you chewing my gum?

56:09.119 --> 56:11.455
I don't know. Maybe.

56:11.538 --> 56:13.665
You wanna come get it?

56:25.552 --> 56:27.429
You, you don't think
things are moving

56:27.513 --> 56:28.889
too fast with us, do you?

56:28.972 --> 56:32.976
Baby, don't be silly.
We're soulmates.

56:33.060 --> 56:36.522
This is true love.
When you know, you know.

56:36.605 --> 56:38.148
You're so right.

56:38.232 --> 56:42.569
This has been the happiest
six hours of my life.

56:42.653 --> 56:46.031
Mr. Yankovic, you have a phone call
at the host stand.

56:47.199 --> 56:48.742
Excuse me, my love.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.876
This better be good.

56:59.461 --> 57:00.671
Well...

57:02.172 --> 57:04.007
What's going on, Tony?

57:04.091 --> 57:08.554
<i>Okay, um, I-I thought you should</i>
<i>hear it from me first.</i>

57:08.637 --> 57:13.308
Michael Jackson just released
a new single called "Beat It."

57:13.392 --> 57:15.394
<i>It's, um...</i>

57:15.477 --> 57:18.188
Well, it's-it's a parody of "Eat It."

57:18.272 --> 57:20.858
You mean the kid from the Jackson Five?

57:20.941 --> 57:23.402
Why is that has-been trying
to ride my coattails?

57:23.485 --> 57:25.988
He actually has
a pretty successful solo career now.

57:26.071 --> 57:27.406
Whatever! You're telling me

57:27.489 --> 57:29.700
Michael Jackson recorded
a parody of my song?

57:29.783 --> 57:32.870
<i> Yeah, that's what I'm saying.</i>
<i>Same music, different words.</i>

57:32.953 --> 57:34.663
What kinda sick freak
changes the words

57:34.746 --> 57:36.540
to someone else's song?

57:37.624 --> 57:39.418
<i>"Beat It," huh?</i>

57:39.501 --> 57:41.336
Wait, so it's about eggs?

57:41.420 --> 57:42.921
<i> No, no, it's, uh, I don't</i>
<i>think it's even about food.</i>

57:43.005 --> 57:45.132
<i>It's about fighting or....</i>

57:45.215 --> 57:47.176
trying to avoid a fight?
I'm not exactly sure--

57:47.259 --> 57:51.305
What gives him the right?!
Can he even do this?

57:51.388 --> 57:53.557
I think you're overreacting
just a little, okay?

57:53.640 --> 57:57.060
<i>I mean, this could be great publicity.</i>
<i>Sell a few more albums.</i>

57:57.144 --> 58:00.397
No, I don't need to
sell more albums, Tony!

58:00.480 --> 58:04.735
I need people to start taking me seriously
as an artist that creates original music.

58:04.818 --> 58:06.612
Now some idiots
will probably get confused

58:06.695 --> 58:09.281
and think "Beat It" came first!

58:09.364 --> 58:10.949
Nobody's gonna think that.

58:11.033 --> 58:13.327
This is a disaster,
for the rest of my life now,

58:13.410 --> 58:15.412
I'm gonna be linked to
this Michael Jackson guy.

58:15.495 --> 58:17.206
<i>And why would that be so bad?</i>

58:17.289 --> 58:19.499
You know, maybe it's a good thing.
I-I think it's an honor.

58:19.583 --> 58:21.001
Michael's one of the biggest stars
in the world.

58:29.343 --> 58:30.969
Everything okay?

58:31.053 --> 58:33.639
Everything's pretty freaking not okay.

58:33.722 --> 58:35.474
I finally created something of my own

58:35.557 --> 58:38.852
and now people are just gonna think
I'm ripping off Michael Jackson.

58:38.936 --> 58:40.854
Your filet?

58:43.440 --> 58:45.651
I think I lost my appetite.

58:45.734 --> 58:48.779
Babe, you seem stressed.
You should have a drink.

58:48.862 --> 58:50.906
I don't really drink.

58:50.989 --> 58:53.033
If there's one thing I've learned in life,
the only thing that can clear your head

58:53.116 --> 58:57.079
and make you feel better is
hard alcohol, and lots of it.

58:57.162 --> 59:01.583
Well, you know me better than anyone.

59:03.210 --> 59:04.211
I trust you.

59:05.754 --> 59:07.172
He'll have a whiskey, neat.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.638
You know what? Maybe you should bring
the whole bottle.

59:26.525 --> 59:29.069
-I know, right?

59:29.152 --> 59:33.907
Hey, hey. The king is here!
Let's get this party started.

59:33.991 --> 59:37.286
Dude, soundcheck was supposed to start
like three hours ago.

59:37.369 --> 59:41.957
Well, I wasn't here three hours ago,
so we're starting now.

59:42.040 --> 59:43.750
Al, are you drunk?

59:43.834 --> 59:46.837
-I'm not drunk, you're all drunk.
-No, this is pointless.

59:46.920 --> 59:49.339
Hey, man, why don't you
just get out of here?

59:49.423 --> 59:51.717
I need to get out of here?
You need to get out of here!

59:51.800 --> 59:53.343
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Guys, guys!

59:53.427 --> 59:55.971
Al, look, it's the first show
of the tour tonight.

59:56.054 --> 59:57.723
It's kind of a big deal.

59:57.806 --> 59:59.308
Do you think you could maybe
not screw this up for everybody?

59:59.391 --> 1:00:02.436
Oh, what-what-what are you gonna do,
fire me?

1:00:02.519 --> 1:00:05.814
You guys are nothing without me.

1:00:05.898 --> 1:00:08.775
Yeah, I could replace
you with a drum machine

1:00:08.859 --> 1:00:12.613
and you with a guitar machine

1:00:12.696 --> 1:00:17.159
and you with a, I don't know,
with some other machine.

1:00:17.242 --> 1:00:19.620
You're all just a bunch of normals, okay,

1:00:19.703 --> 1:00:23.457
I'm the weird one!
I am the weird one!

1:00:29.379 --> 1:00:32.382
Okay. That's it.

1:00:40.140 --> 1:00:41.683
You've changed, man.

1:00:43.268 --> 1:00:46.230
-Fame's really gotten to you.

1:00:46.313 --> 1:00:47.898
Wow.

1:00:51.235 --> 1:00:54.488
Look, just get yourself cleaned up
for the show tonight, all right?

1:00:58.200 --> 1:00:59.826
-You're a mess.
-Yeah.

1:01:05.791 --> 1:01:07.543
They seem nice.

1:01:07.626 --> 1:01:08.627
Yeah, they're great.

1:01:10.879 --> 1:01:13.924
-Al?
-Oh, what do you want?

1:01:14.007 --> 1:01:15.759
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1:01:18.512 --> 1:01:20.389
Privately?

1:01:20.472 --> 1:01:23.392
Look, anything you wanna say to me,
you can say in front of my girlfriend.

1:01:25.018 --> 1:01:27.938
Okay, fine.

1:01:28.021 --> 1:01:30.649
-I think Madonna's a bad influence on you.

1:01:30.732 --> 1:01:32.776
I think she's an evil, conniving succubus

1:01:32.860 --> 1:01:35.696
and she's only using you
for her pathetic and selfish needs.

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:37.447
-What?
-No offense.

1:01:37.531 --> 1:01:41.535
She only wants you for that
sweet, sweet Yankovic Bump.

1:01:41.618 --> 1:01:42.911
She knows her record sales

1:01:42.995 --> 1:01:45.330
will go through the roof
if you parody her.

1:01:45.414 --> 1:01:47.124
How dare you.

1:01:47.207 --> 1:01:51.879
This woman is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

1:01:51.962 --> 1:01:55.674
And besides, I already told her
I'm not doing any more, um...

1:01:55.757 --> 1:01:58.510
Any more...
The thing you said.

1:01:58.594 --> 1:02:00.262
-Song parodies.
-Song parodies!

1:02:00.345 --> 1:02:01.930
You're so drunk right now,

1:02:02.014 --> 1:02:04.141
I bet you couldn't even
give her that Yankovic Bump.

1:02:04.224 --> 1:02:05.934
That's not true!

1:02:06.018 --> 1:02:08.103
That's not true, I'll come up with
that song parody right now.

1:02:08.187 --> 1:02:11.481
Instead of "Like a Virgin,"
it'll be "Like a..."

1:02:11.565 --> 1:02:12.733
Like a...

1:02:14.776 --> 1:02:16.320
Like a...

1:02:16.403 --> 1:02:18.280
Shut up, it's impossible!
Nothing rhymes with virgin.

1:02:18.363 --> 1:02:19.781
Al, listen.

1:02:20.741 --> 1:02:22.201
You gotta take care of yourself.

1:02:22.284 --> 1:02:24.244
When she's done with you,
she's gonna drop you

1:02:24.328 --> 1:02:25.996
like a sack of spoiled cabbage.

1:02:26.079 --> 1:02:28.582
No, no, shut up, shut up!
You're not my dad.

1:02:28.665 --> 1:02:31.877
You think you're my dad,
but you are not my dad.

1:02:35.339 --> 1:02:37.633
Baby? Baby, where are you going?

1:02:37.716 --> 1:02:39.927
I'm goin' for a drive to clear my mind,
on my own.

1:02:40.010 --> 1:02:43.597
No, no, no, no, no. You cannot go.

1:02:45.849 --> 1:02:47.476
Without your car keys.

1:02:47.559 --> 1:02:50.854
Thank you so much.

1:03:05.786 --> 1:03:07.663
<i>Well, we can't wait.</i>

1:03:07.746 --> 1:03:09.915
<i>Weird Al hits the stage</i>
<i>at Joe Robbie Stadium</i>

1:03:09.998 --> 1:03:13.669
<i>tonight at eight o'clock,</i>
<i>and it's gonna be off the chain.</i>

1:03:13.752 --> 1:03:15.045
<i>One for the history--</i>

1:03:26.807 --> 1:03:29.226
<i> Well, that was</i>
<i>multi-platinum recording artist</i>

1:03:29.309 --> 1:03:31.854
<i>"Weird Al" Yankovic with</i>
<i>"I Love Rocky Road," and my god,</i>

1:03:31.937 --> 1:03:34.773
<i>have you ever seen</i>
<i>a more durable pop artist?</i>

1:03:34.857 --> 1:03:36.191
<i>Anything you throw at this guy,</i>

1:03:36.275 --> 1:03:38.694
<i>he just seems capable of surviving it.</i>

1:03:38.777 --> 1:03:41.488
<i>I'll bet he could land a plane</i>
<i>into a volcano</i>

1:03:41.572 --> 1:03:44.157
<i>-and still come out--</i>

1:04:01.008 --> 1:04:02.384
Dammit.

1:04:04.595 --> 1:04:06.763
All right, nurse, let's call it.

1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:10.684
Time of death: 7:30--

1:04:15.147 --> 1:04:16.523
Quick!

1:04:16.607 --> 1:04:18.692
I need some paper and
a number two pencil.

1:04:18.775 --> 1:04:20.402
Here you go, baby.

1:04:20.485 --> 1:04:22.446
Excuse me, miss, he's
in no condition to be doing--

1:04:22.529 --> 1:04:26.158
Look, there's no time, okay?
He's got a show in 30 minutes.

1:04:26.241 --> 1:04:28.827
-All right.

1:04:28.911 --> 1:04:30.996
Better give me all your gauze, nurse.

1:05:15.332 --> 1:05:16.375
Yes!

1:05:31.098 --> 1:05:35.602
This is all for you, babe.
I love you so much.

1:05:35.686 --> 1:05:38.105
I think I should have stuck around
for that blood transfusion though,

1:05:38.188 --> 1:05:40.983
-I think I'm gonna pass out.
-No, babe, you're killing it.

1:05:41.066 --> 1:05:43.026
-Now get back out there.
-Okay.

1:06:32.910 --> 1:06:36.455
Okay, babe, you have a costume change,
one more song

1:06:36.538 --> 1:06:38.290
and then we can go home
and sleep it off.

1:06:38.373 --> 1:06:39.458
Okay.

1:06:44.004 --> 1:06:47.090
No, no, no, no. What-what is that?
I'm not wearing that.

1:06:47.174 --> 1:06:49.635
-It's your "Eat It" jacket, babe.
-No, not anymore, it's not.

1:06:49.718 --> 1:06:52.179
That is a Michael Jackson jacket now.
I don't wanna see it.

1:06:52.262 --> 1:06:53.680
Get that outta my face.

1:06:53.764 --> 1:06:55.057
You don't have to wear it
if you don't want to.

1:06:55.140 --> 1:06:58.477
Now just drink up.
Yeah, that's good, yeah.

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:01.939
Little more, little more.
That's the medicine.

1:07:35.514 --> 1:07:39.852
Boo, boo, boo, boo!

1:07:39.935 --> 1:07:43.021
Yeah, that's what you sound like.
Boo!

1:07:45.274 --> 1:07:47.985
Oh, what? You want,
do you wanna hear "Eat It?"

1:07:48.068 --> 1:07:49.862
-Do you?

1:07:49.945 --> 1:07:52.906
Okay, here goes.

1:07:58.453 --> 1:08:00.998
You're all a bunch of slaves!

1:08:01.081 --> 1:08:02.708
-You're morons.

1:08:02.791 --> 1:08:05.294
Idiots!

1:08:05.377 --> 1:08:08.630
Oh, what, what, you paid good money
to see a show?

1:08:08.714 --> 1:08:12.634
You worked your little butts off
at some dangerous factory?

1:08:12.718 --> 1:08:16.763
God only knows what they make there!

1:08:16.847 --> 1:08:18.724
No one will tell you that.

1:08:23.437 --> 1:08:26.607
What do they make in the factory?

1:08:26.690 --> 1:08:28.442
What do they make?!

1:08:30.694 --> 1:08:34.364
Do you like getting pushed around?

1:08:34.448 --> 1:08:37.034
You like letting everybody
push you around?

1:08:37.117 --> 1:08:41.663
Yeah, I think you do.
I think you like it.

1:08:41.747 --> 1:08:45.000
You like letting your dad
push you around?

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:46.418
No!

1:08:46.502 --> 1:08:49.421
You like letting Michael Jackson
push you around?

1:08:49.505 --> 1:08:53.217
-No!

1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:56.762
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

1:08:56.845 --> 1:08:59.348
What are you gonna do about it?!

1:08:59.431 --> 1:09:03.143
-What are you gonna do?!

1:09:06.563 --> 1:09:10.150
So... you wanna see it?

1:09:13.904 --> 1:09:16.031
Do you want me to show it to you?

1:09:18.825 --> 1:09:20.827
I'm gonna whip it out!

1:09:23.413 --> 1:09:25.457
You don't think I'll do it, do you?

1:09:25.541 --> 1:09:28.752
I haven't whipped it out yet
but I'm gonna do it for you,

1:09:28.836 --> 1:09:32.130
but only if you really want me to.

1:09:34.842 --> 1:09:37.219
Okay, here goes!

1:09:39.012 --> 1:09:40.681
Yeah!

1:09:42.432 --> 1:09:45.394
-Get off me! Get off me!

1:09:50.190 --> 1:09:51.817
<i> We're sorry to interrupt</i>

1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:53.986
<i>the President's address,</i>
<i>but we have breaking news.</i>

1:09:54.069 --> 1:09:58.198
<i>Parody songsmith "Weird Al" Yankovic</i>
<i>was arrested earlier tonight</i>

1:09:58.282 --> 1:10:01.618
<i>in Miami-Dade County</i>
<i>for lewd behavior.</i>

1:10:09.793 --> 1:10:11.795
Okay. Here's my thought.

1:10:11.879 --> 1:10:14.131
I think this is a really great idea,
I hope you like it.

1:10:14.214 --> 1:10:15.841
We team up, right?

1:10:15.924 --> 1:10:18.343
I'll write all the, you know,
good songs, the real ones,

1:10:18.427 --> 1:10:22.806
and then you parody them every time.
Bam, bam. It's perfect.

1:10:24.683 --> 1:10:26.226
Sounds great.

1:10:26.310 --> 1:10:28.061
It's foolproof, we'll be unstoppable.

1:10:28.145 --> 1:10:30.898
We'll be the hottest power couple
in the entire music industry.

1:10:30.981 --> 1:10:32.900
What would our power couple name be?

1:10:32.983 --> 1:10:37.154
I'm thinking Madankovic
or Madonnavic

1:10:37.237 --> 1:10:41.491
or maybe just Madonna.

1:10:41.575 --> 1:10:43.952
There'll be plenty of time
to figure all of that out.

1:10:44.036 --> 1:10:45.954
But can you imagine the world tour?

1:10:46.038 --> 1:10:49.374
Madonna... with Weird Al.

1:10:50.709 --> 1:10:53.962
All that money?
I just got the tingles.

1:10:56.882 --> 1:10:59.426
But I mean, you're okay
with all of this, right?

1:11:00.511 --> 1:11:01.887
Look, babe, I'm--

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:07.184
I'm seriously okay
with anything you wanna do.

1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:12.397
I mean, look at me. I'm a train wreck.

1:11:12.481 --> 1:11:15.359
I'm barely holding it together.

1:11:15.442 --> 1:11:18.111
My parents wrote me off.

1:11:18.195 --> 1:11:22.324
I pushed away my band, Dr. Demento,

1:11:22.407 --> 1:11:24.701
everyone who was important to me.

1:11:27.246 --> 1:11:29.456
You're all I got.

1:11:29.540 --> 1:11:32.835
You are literally the only thing
I have left in the world,

1:11:32.918 --> 1:11:37.464
and if anything happened to you,
I don't know what I would do.

1:11:39.591 --> 1:11:42.427
No, no! No!

1:11:42.511 --> 1:11:44.888
Relax, Mr. Yankovic.

1:11:44.972 --> 1:11:46.640
We only wanna borrow your girlfriend.

1:11:46.723 --> 1:11:49.601
Just stay calm and
nothing will happen to you.

1:11:49.685 --> 1:11:52.521
Please, sir, please.
Whatever you do--

1:11:56.316 --> 1:11:57.776
Don't hurt me.

1:12:00.279 --> 1:12:02.406
-Help me!
-Madonna!

1:12:06.118 --> 1:12:08.620
-Hiya!

1:12:52.414 --> 1:12:55.459
-Die, die!

1:12:57.794 --> 1:13:00.005
-Order up.

1:13:02.216 --> 1:13:05.010
Pablo Escobar sends his regards!

1:13:12.142 --> 1:13:16.313
Pablo Escobar, you just made
the biggest mistake of your life.

1:14:32.723 --> 1:14:34.683
This'll do.

1:14:49.573 --> 1:14:51.909
So, then I'm stomping on him and
stomping him with my boots,

1:14:51.992 --> 1:14:53.577
and he's calling for
his mom and I'm like,

1:14:53.660 --> 1:14:55.787
"Stop being so extra."
You know, it's like--

1:14:55.871 --> 1:14:59.875
Oh, my goodness! Ha ha!
That better not be vanilla.

1:14:59.958 --> 1:15:01.293
Who was it?

1:15:01.376 --> 1:15:03.712
-No, who was it?
-Escobar!

1:15:03.795 --> 1:15:07.007
Oh, Mr. Yankovic.

1:15:07.090 --> 1:15:10.219
We've been expecting you.
Welcome, welcome.

1:15:10.302 --> 1:15:14.723
As you know, I am a huge,
huge fan of your music.

1:15:14.806 --> 1:15:17.976
I got all of your albums
through the Columbia House Record Club.

1:15:18.060 --> 1:15:21.438
Twelve for one penny, you guys.
Really great deal.

1:15:21.522 --> 1:15:23.023
Really great deal.

1:15:23.106 --> 1:15:26.860
Anyway, I-- Oops.
I hope you will forgive me

1:15:26.944 --> 1:15:28.904
for kidnapping your lovely girlfriend.

1:15:28.987 --> 1:15:31.657
It just seemed like
that was the only way

1:15:31.740 --> 1:15:34.743
to guarantee that you would
come to my birthday party.

1:15:34.826 --> 1:15:38.497
Your agent, oy, a real nightmare
to deal with, if I'm gonna be honest.

1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:40.123
Real vicious guy.

1:15:40.207 --> 1:15:42.417
You know, I'm sorry.
Let me turn down the music please.

1:15:42.501 --> 1:15:43.919
Just a little annoying, yeah.

1:15:50.092 --> 1:15:52.678
I can hear myself think now.

1:15:52.761 --> 1:15:54.847
It's so noisy up in there.
Aah, the voices.

1:15:54.930 --> 1:15:57.349
Oh. Oh, where are my manners?

1:15:57.432 --> 1:16:00.686
We were just about to cut the cake.
May I offer you a slice?

1:16:00.769 --> 1:16:02.145
Let's get him a slice, please.

1:16:02.229 --> 1:16:04.106
No. No cake.

1:16:04.189 --> 1:16:06.692
Okay, Mr. Diet.

1:16:06.775 --> 1:16:08.026
More for us, am I right?

1:16:08.110 --> 1:16:10.988
I just want my woman, then I'll go.

1:16:12.531 --> 1:16:16.410
Ah, you want your woman. Okay.

1:16:16.493 --> 1:16:21.039
I'm afraid that's
not how it works, Mr. Yankovic.

1:16:21.123 --> 1:16:24.042
You see, you can't leave until you
perform for me.

1:16:24.126 --> 1:16:26.086
-Do you understand me?
-No dice.

1:16:26.170 --> 1:16:28.589
Not gonna happen.
I'm not your monkey.

1:16:28.672 --> 1:16:32.509
-I can do "Borderline."
-No, I don't want that. I want him.

1:16:32.593 --> 1:16:35.888
Mr. Yankovic, why-why all the drama?

1:16:35.971 --> 1:16:37.723
I mean, you're already here.

1:16:37.806 --> 1:16:41.476
Just perform one measly song for us
and then you guys can leave.

1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:44.813
Come on, just one song, no?

1:16:44.897 --> 1:16:47.482
How about that wonderful

1:16:47.566 --> 1:16:50.068
Michael Jackson parody
that you did, huh?

1:16:51.403 --> 1:16:54.573
That's not a parody!

1:17:20.891 --> 1:17:24.728
Stop! Stop! It's my birthday.
Stop it! Stop it!

1:17:27.272 --> 1:17:31.276
Well, first off, rude. Okay?
And second of all,

1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:34.488
if you really, really don't wanna
entertain us, then fine.

1:17:34.571 --> 1:17:36.031
You can just leave.

1:17:38.075 --> 1:17:40.244
Wait, so, so we can just go?

1:17:41.662 --> 1:17:44.373
Yeah, you can go whenever you want.

1:17:45.290 --> 1:17:47.042
Psych!

1:17:47.125 --> 1:17:48.836
No!

1:17:53.590 --> 1:17:55.175
Very unfortunate.

1:17:55.259 --> 1:17:59.429
He was like a god among men,
and now just worm food.

1:17:59.513 --> 1:18:04.309
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Anyway, back to the party.
Should we cut the cake or...?

1:18:04.393 --> 1:18:10.065
Hey, Pablo, you forgot one thing.

1:18:12.109 --> 1:18:13.652
I'm certified platinum.

1:18:16.864 --> 1:18:18.156
Hey, Escobar.

1:18:19.241 --> 1:18:20.701
Eat it.

1:18:28.917 --> 1:18:31.587
Okay, let's get outta here.

1:18:34.882 --> 1:18:37.384
I just gotta get this medallion.

1:18:37.467 --> 1:18:42.347
Okay.
Oh, it's in there. Ah.

1:18:42.431 --> 1:18:45.684
Oh, gross, gross, gross,
gross, gross!

1:18:50.230 --> 1:18:51.648
You just killed Pablo Escobar!

1:18:51.732 --> 1:18:54.818
I know! I've killed so many people
this week.

1:18:54.902 --> 1:18:58.530
Before last Thursday,
I never really killed anyone.

1:18:58.614 --> 1:19:02.534
The things we do for love, huh?
Okay, come on. We gotta go.

1:19:02.618 --> 1:19:06.538
Well, now, wait, wait, wait,
hear me out here.

1:19:06.622 --> 1:19:10.417
With Escobar out of the picture, maybe...

1:19:10.501 --> 1:19:12.211
maybe we can run the drug cartel.

1:19:12.294 --> 1:19:13.795
Wait, what?

1:19:13.879 --> 1:19:15.881
Supply and demand, baby.

1:19:15.964 --> 1:19:20.511
Look, someone's gotta run the cartel.
May as well be me. Us.

1:19:20.594 --> 1:19:23.347
You can't be serious.
What about all our plans?

1:19:23.430 --> 1:19:25.766
Writing songs together, touring together.

1:19:25.849 --> 1:19:28.685
Why rule the music industry
when you can rule the world?

1:19:28.769 --> 1:19:31.730
All the money and power is right here.

1:19:31.813 --> 1:19:34.024
Madonna, that's...

1:19:34.107 --> 1:19:36.109
No. No way.

1:19:36.193 --> 1:19:40.364
My life is in America, and my
family would never forgive me

1:19:40.447 --> 1:19:42.533
if I became involved in a drug cartel.

1:19:42.616 --> 1:19:45.327
Well, your family's
already disowned you, Al.

1:19:45.410 --> 1:19:47.829
I'm all you've got, remember?

1:19:49.289 --> 1:19:54.002
And we'll still be together.
I'll be the head of the cartel...

1:19:54.086 --> 1:19:55.671
and you can be my number two.

1:19:57.589 --> 1:19:58.715
Your number two.

1:20:01.468 --> 1:20:05.597
I can't believe this.
Dr. Demento was right.

1:20:05.681 --> 1:20:09.226
You were just using me to further
your own career, weren't you?

1:20:11.478 --> 1:20:14.815
Well... yeah.

1:20:16.149 --> 1:20:18.402
My relationship with you
was a business decision...

1:20:18.485 --> 1:20:23.574
and so is this.
It's all just business.

1:20:26.702 --> 1:20:27.703
Wow.

1:20:30.122 --> 1:20:33.041
Well, okay then.

1:20:35.002 --> 1:20:37.462
I guess-- I guess that's it.

1:20:43.177 --> 1:20:44.595
Have a nice life.

1:20:53.187 --> 1:20:54.188
Whoa!

1:20:56.064 --> 1:20:59.735
I can't let you leave, Al.
You know too much.

1:20:59.818 --> 1:21:01.236
What are you talking about?

1:21:02.779 --> 1:21:05.073
Stop that!

1:21:05.157 --> 1:21:08.160
We could have made
such a beautiful team,

1:21:08.243 --> 1:21:09.870
and you know what?

1:21:09.953 --> 1:21:12.122
I decided I do like Weirdonna
better than Madonnavic.

1:21:13.874 --> 1:21:16.335
But that's all over now.

1:21:16.418 --> 1:21:19.713
Our partnership is officially dissolved.

1:21:22.841 --> 1:21:24.259
Goodbye, Madonna.

1:21:43.278 --> 1:21:46.782
<i> Yeah. I had</i>
<i>a lot of soul searching to do.</i>

1:21:46.865 --> 1:21:50.369
<i>Was I a parody singer?</i>
<i>An original artist?</i>

1:21:50.452 --> 1:21:53.080
<i>The most dangerous</i>
<i>assassin in the world?</i>

1:21:53.163 --> 1:21:55.374
<i>Maybe I had lost my way.</i>

1:21:55.457 --> 1:21:57.084
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>there were things</i>

1:21:57.167 --> 1:21:59.169
<i>I loved about being Weird Al.</i>

1:21:59.253 --> 1:22:01.338
<i>The fame, the money,</i>

1:22:01.421 --> 1:22:04.091
<i>the fancy dinners,</i>
<i>joining the Illuminati,</i>

1:22:04.174 --> 1:22:06.677
<i>going to the Illuminati</i>
<i>holiday party,</i>

1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:10.264
<i>learning the truth about</i>
<i>the moon landing and JFK.</i>

1:22:10.347 --> 1:22:14.017
<i>But without my family,</i>
<i>none of that mattered.</i>

1:22:14.101 --> 1:22:16.103
<i>I knew what I had to do.</i>

1:22:32.911 --> 1:22:34.830
There it is, pretty simple.

1:22:36.915 --> 1:22:41.128
When the light turns green,
you turn this crank to the left.

1:22:41.211 --> 1:22:45.507
When it turns red, you stop
and pull this lever down.

1:22:45.591 --> 1:22:48.635
When it turns green again,
you push this lever up

1:22:48.719 --> 1:22:52.347
and turn this crank back to the right.

1:22:52.431 --> 1:22:55.767
Yep, that's about it. Lunch is at 12:30.

1:22:57.519 --> 1:22:59.062
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1:23:00.105 --> 1:23:01.356
Sure.

1:23:02.941 --> 1:23:05.944
What do we make here?

1:23:06.028 --> 1:23:10.532
Your old man
said you was funny.

1:23:10.616 --> 1:23:13.785
That's a good one.
"What do we make here?"

1:23:43.732 --> 1:23:46.860
Somebody help! My leg!

1:23:46.944 --> 1:23:48.362
Oh, uh...

1:23:48.445 --> 1:23:52.407
It's burning me! Oh, my leg!

1:23:52.491 --> 1:23:55.702
Ahh! Ahh! It burns!

1:23:58.205 --> 1:23:59.748
Hey.

1:23:59.831 --> 1:24:02.000
<i>Cleanup crew to the control room.</i>

1:24:02.084 --> 1:24:03.877
You got a minute?

1:24:03.961 --> 1:24:06.296
Well, what?

1:24:08.549 --> 1:24:10.759
You want to take a swing, old man?

1:24:14.221 --> 1:24:15.389
No.

1:24:17.766 --> 1:24:21.436
Just... what are you doing here?

1:24:22.604 --> 1:24:25.649
What am I doing here? Really?!

1:24:27.568 --> 1:24:30.362
All my life, all I wanted to do
is please you,

1:24:30.445 --> 1:24:32.197
but I was never enough.

1:24:32.281 --> 1:24:35.242
You were always disappointed
in your weird son.

1:24:35.325 --> 1:24:38.745
So yeah, I gave up
the most successful career

1:24:38.829 --> 1:24:41.748
in music history to come work
at this miserable factory

1:24:41.832 --> 1:24:43.542
because it's what
you've always wanted

1:24:43.625 --> 1:24:45.836
and what, it is still
not enough for you?

1:24:45.919 --> 1:24:47.462
I appreciate what you're doing.

1:24:48.922 --> 1:24:51.341
This isn't the life for you.

1:24:51.425 --> 1:24:53.969
Oh, what? So I'm not even
good at turning cranks now.

1:24:54.052 --> 1:24:55.512
No, Alfred, that's
not what I'm saying.

1:24:55.596 --> 1:24:57.222
What are you saying, then?

1:25:03.020 --> 1:25:04.938
I was wrong to stand in your way.

1:25:07.983 --> 1:25:10.110
This isn't what you were meant for.

1:25:11.945 --> 1:25:13.238
You're special.

1:25:14.656 --> 1:25:18.660
You're Weird Al, and you're my son.

1:25:21.580 --> 1:25:22.831
And I'm, uh...

1:25:24.291 --> 1:25:25.584
I'm proud of you.

1:25:33.175 --> 1:25:34.593
What are you doing?

1:25:40.057 --> 1:25:41.058
Dad!

1:25:55.489 --> 1:25:58.242
-Yeah, that's an absolute classic.

1:25:58.325 --> 1:26:01.119
Whew.

1:26:01.203 --> 1:26:03.664
Well, so Mom tells me you're
dating that singer Madonna.

1:26:03.747 --> 1:26:07.292
Oh, um, no, we-we broke up.

1:26:07.376 --> 1:26:10.295
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. What happened?

1:26:10.379 --> 1:26:12.756
Yeah. It's-it's complicated.

1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:15.676
Well, don't worry.
There's plenty of other fish in the sea.

1:26:15.759 --> 1:26:19.429
So, so, what is it like?
What's it like being you?

1:26:19.513 --> 1:26:22.975
You know, world famous superstar and all?

1:26:23.058 --> 1:26:29.106
Well, um, it's-it's fun,
but it's also a lot of pressure.

1:26:30.274 --> 1:26:33.652
The hardest part for me
is just coming up with new songs.

1:26:33.735 --> 1:26:37.197
I-I never know where my
next idea's gonna come from.

1:26:37.281 --> 1:26:40.450
And yeah, I-I honestly, I don't know
if I have it in me anymore.

1:26:40.534 --> 1:26:43.579
Oh, nonsense.
I'm sure that next big idea

1:26:43.662 --> 1:26:45.831
is just right there in front of you.

1:26:49.751 --> 1:26:52.379
Well, you may have noticed
I've put on a little weight.

1:26:52.462 --> 1:26:54.131
Don't be silly, Ma. You look great.

1:26:54.214 --> 1:26:57.009
You do, dear. I think you look wonderful
with a few extra pounds.

1:26:57.092 --> 1:26:58.635
I think you're pleasingly plump.

1:26:58.719 --> 1:27:01.722
Oh, Nick. You know I'm fat.

1:27:01.805 --> 1:27:03.682
I'm fat, you know it.

1:27:08.270 --> 1:27:09.605
What?

1:27:09.688 --> 1:27:10.647
Wow.

1:27:10.731 --> 1:27:12.816
Dad, can I ask you something?

1:27:14.902 --> 1:27:18.655
Mom told me growing up,
you always had your reasons

1:27:18.739 --> 1:27:20.574
for being so hard on me.

1:27:24.494 --> 1:27:26.246
I think it's time, dear.

1:27:29.458 --> 1:27:30.792
All right.

1:27:44.473 --> 1:27:47.267
Oh, whoa.

1:27:48.894 --> 1:27:53.148
I wrote it all down.
This should explain everything.

1:27:53.232 --> 1:27:56.693
Okay, do you have maybe
a-a photo album

1:27:56.777 --> 1:27:58.987
or we can just go through
the bullet points together?

1:27:59.071 --> 1:28:02.115
I don't have a photo album,
but I have a sketchbook.

1:28:02.199 --> 1:28:03.659
A sketchbook?

1:28:06.078 --> 1:28:09.665
You see, we didn't have any cameras

1:28:09.748 --> 1:28:13.168
when I was growing up because...

1:28:16.004 --> 1:28:17.506
I was raised Amish.

1:28:19.216 --> 1:28:20.801
What, really?

1:28:20.884 --> 1:28:24.054
Yep. I grew up Amish.

1:28:24.930 --> 1:28:27.683
<i>Lived in the community for</i>
<i>the first 16 years of my life.</i>

1:28:27.766 --> 1:28:31.061
<i>And frankly, I don't think I</i>
<i>ever really fit in</i>

1:28:31.144 --> 1:28:33.689
<i>because, well, if I'm being honest,</i>

1:28:33.772 --> 1:28:37.818
<i>I was just as weird as you</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

1:28:38.777 --> 1:28:40.779
<i>Yeah, I even made up new words</i>
<i>to the hymns</i>

1:28:40.863 --> 1:28:42.865
<i>that we sang during church service.</i>

1:28:42.948 --> 1:28:45.284
<i>-That didn't go over too well.</i>

1:28:47.286 --> 1:28:49.955
<i>That boy will never learn.</i>

1:28:50.038 --> 1:28:51.748
<i>And then when I was</i>
<i>a few years older,</i>

1:28:51.832 --> 1:28:53.834
<i>I was able to go on rumspringa.</i>

1:28:53.917 --> 1:28:56.628
<i>I finally had a chance to go out</i>
<i>into the great big world</i>

1:28:56.712 --> 1:29:00.424
<i>and see what it had to offer.</i>

1:29:00.507 --> 1:29:03.093
<i>And that's when I saw</i>
<i>the love of my life,</i>

1:29:03.177 --> 1:29:06.346
<i>a 1933 Excelsior,</i>

1:29:06.430 --> 1:29:10.225
<i>the finest accordion there ever was.</i>

1:29:10.309 --> 1:29:14.730
<i>Cost me every penny I had</i>
<i>in the world, but it was worth it.</i>

1:29:14.813 --> 1:29:17.191
So wait-wait-wait,
you had an accordion?

1:29:17.274 --> 1:29:20.736
I did, I did, I did,
I was pretty good at it too.

1:29:20.819 --> 1:29:23.322
I was not bad. I was not bad at all.

1:29:23.405 --> 1:29:25.073
I thought I was the love of your life.

1:29:25.157 --> 1:29:27.117
Oh, honey, you come later, please.
Anyway...

1:29:27.201 --> 1:29:28.911
So, I tried for months to make it

1:29:28.994 --> 1:29:30.829
<i>as a professional musician,</i>

1:29:30.913 --> 1:29:32.456
<i>but it just wasn't in God's plan.</i>

1:29:32.539 --> 1:29:33.999
<i> Get outta here!</i>

1:29:34.082 --> 1:29:36.752
<i>Failure mocked me</i>
<i>at every waking moment.</i>

1:29:36.835 --> 1:29:38.587
<i>Hey, there, squeeze box.</i>

1:29:38.670 --> 1:29:41.089
<i> I knew that I had to</i>
<i>give up my dream</i>

1:29:41.173 --> 1:29:44.259
<i>and go back to the only life</i>
<i>that I'd ever known.</i>

1:29:44.343 --> 1:29:46.887
<i>But when I tried to come back</i>
<i>to the Amish community,</i>

1:29:46.970 --> 1:29:49.556
<i>well, the second they</i>
<i>saw that squeeze box,</i>

1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:54.478
<i>I was immediately ex-communicated,</i>
<i>banished forever.</i>

1:29:54.561 --> 1:29:56.772
<i>My whole world</i>
<i>was torn away from me.</i>

1:29:56.855 --> 1:29:58.941
<i>All I knew was</i>
<i>I never wanted to see</i>

1:29:59.024 --> 1:30:02.778
<i>another accordion again,</i>
<i>for as long as I lived.</i>

1:30:02.861 --> 1:30:05.239
<i>So I got a job at the factory,</i>

1:30:05.322 --> 1:30:08.784
<i>a place where I knew you could</i>
<i>get an honest day's wages</i>

1:30:08.867 --> 1:30:10.994
<i>for an honest day's work.</i>

1:30:11.078 --> 1:30:12.704
And that's when I met...

1:30:13.914 --> 1:30:15.541
the true love of my life.

1:30:16.959 --> 1:30:18.544
Your mother.

1:30:18.627 --> 1:30:20.254
Wow.

1:30:20.337 --> 1:30:22.965
Dad, I-- I never knew.

1:30:25.259 --> 1:30:27.886
Of course you didn't.
How could you, I just told you.

1:30:27.970 --> 1:30:30.222
I just, the whole story was about--

1:30:31.181 --> 1:30:32.975
Anyway, look,

1:30:34.184 --> 1:30:37.312
son, I hope that you can forgive me
and I hope you understand.

1:30:39.398 --> 1:30:41.942
I lost everything
and I didn't want you

1:30:42.025 --> 1:30:44.278
to suffer the same sad fate.

1:30:46.780 --> 1:30:48.907
I didn't want you
to get your dreams crushed,

1:30:48.991 --> 1:30:52.411
so I thought I should
crush your ideas

1:30:52.494 --> 1:30:54.413
before they could turn into dreams.

1:30:57.708 --> 1:31:00.669
Yeah, that makes sense.

1:31:02.588 --> 1:31:03.630
Oh.

1:31:04.965 --> 1:31:08.135
Oh, that's nothing. You can just
throw that thing out, that's--

1:31:08.218 --> 1:31:10.679
-"Amish Paradise?"
-Nope, just tear that up in little pieces

1:31:10.762 --> 1:31:12.848
-and get rid of that.
-Dad.

1:31:12.931 --> 1:31:14.433
Are these song lyrics?

1:31:14.516 --> 1:31:16.143
That's just something stupid
I wrote a while ago.

1:31:16.226 --> 1:31:17.686
It doesn't matter. You can just--

1:31:17.769 --> 1:31:20.105
No, no, no, Dad, these lyrics...

1:31:21.690 --> 1:31:23.942
they're like a window into your soul.

1:31:25.110 --> 1:31:26.820
I don't think I've ever felt
more connected to you than this

1:31:26.904 --> 1:31:28.530
in my entire life.

1:31:31.867 --> 1:31:34.036
Well, I never had the chance
to perform it myself

1:31:34.119 --> 1:31:36.705
because the dream had already died.

1:31:36.788 --> 1:31:40.542
I thought maybe someday,
but no, never mind.

1:31:40.626 --> 1:31:44.671
Never mind. I guess no one
will ever hear this song.

1:31:48.383 --> 1:31:51.845
That's it! That's it!

1:31:51.929 --> 1:31:53.514
Mom!

1:31:53.597 --> 1:31:55.265
What did you say like
a minute ago, about being fat?

1:31:55.349 --> 1:31:56.934
We're onto something else now.

1:31:57.017 --> 1:31:59.228
We were kind of having
a moment here, son.

1:31:59.311 --> 1:32:00.896
Read the room.

1:32:00.979 --> 1:32:03.732
Yeah, I mean, I wrote the book
and did the whole thing.

1:32:03.815 --> 1:32:04.900
-Alfy!
-The drawing.

1:32:04.983 --> 1:32:06.360
Listen to your father when he's talking!

1:32:06.443 --> 1:32:08.278
Does anything register with you?

1:32:08.362 --> 1:32:11.532
Can you see my lips moving?
Nothing gets through to you.

1:33:07.921 --> 1:33:09.840
Man, I shoulda kept
the publishing rights.

1:33:25.731 --> 1:33:26.732
Yecch!

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.458
It is so good to
have you back, man.

1:33:44.541 --> 1:33:46.418
Yeah, I was starting
to miss the weird one.

1:33:46.502 --> 1:33:49.004
Oh god, I cannot believe
I ever said that to you guys.

1:33:49.087 --> 1:33:50.672
I am so, so sorry.

1:33:50.756 --> 1:33:52.299
Hey, you're an artist.

1:33:52.382 --> 1:33:54.551
Being an abusive jerk
is all part of the process.

1:33:54.635 --> 1:33:56.345
Yeah, name me one creative genius

1:33:56.428 --> 1:33:58.138
that doesn't have a checkered past

1:33:58.222 --> 1:34:00.807
involving drugs, alcohol
and a murderous rampage

1:34:00.891 --> 1:34:02.518
through the heart of the jungle.

1:34:02.601 --> 1:34:05.020
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1:34:05.103 --> 1:34:06.730
I love you guys so much!

1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:10.234
Yeah, yeah. See you out there.

1:34:13.403 --> 1:34:15.531
Dr. D, you came!

1:34:15.614 --> 1:34:18.075
Of course I came. I wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

1:34:18.158 --> 1:34:20.452
And well, needless to say,
you were amazing.

1:34:20.536 --> 1:34:25.499
Thank you. And I-I also,
I really wanna say the way I treated you--

1:34:25.582 --> 1:34:27.626
Stop. I'm gonna stop you
right there, okay?

1:34:27.709 --> 1:34:29.211
No apologies necessary.

1:34:29.294 --> 1:34:31.755
I have been thinking
a lot about what you said,

1:34:31.839 --> 1:34:34.424
and I realized, Al, that...

1:34:37.261 --> 1:34:40.931
you are like a son to me and, uh...

1:34:41.014 --> 1:34:44.184
Well, I never really had any children
of my own, so, uh...

1:34:50.649 --> 1:34:51.984
I want to adopt you.

1:34:57.155 --> 1:34:58.615
Will you be my son?

1:35:00.325 --> 1:35:02.202
Wow.

1:35:02.286 --> 1:35:07.124
Um, you-- I-- I just made up with my dad.

1:35:09.251 --> 1:35:10.377
You d-- You did?

1:35:10.460 --> 1:35:12.129
-Yeah.
-That's, wow. Okay.

1:35:12.212 --> 1:35:13.505
Yeah. So yeah, we-we talked.

1:35:13.589 --> 1:35:15.799
-Wow.
-We're-we're all good now.

1:35:15.883 --> 1:35:17.092
Cool, the coolest. that's great.

1:35:17.176 --> 1:35:18.969
-That's great.
-It is great.

1:35:19.052 --> 1:35:20.554
Oh, good!

1:35:20.637 --> 1:35:21.555
-Yeah.
-Cool.

1:35:21.638 --> 1:35:23.140
Wow, that's so cool.

1:35:23.223 --> 1:35:25.184
That's really cool. That's so cool.

1:35:25.267 --> 1:35:27.519
My, my category
is coming up really soon,

1:35:27.603 --> 1:35:29.313
I think, so I should probably go change?

1:35:29.396 --> 1:35:30.314
You should--
oh, you should go. Yeah, definitely.

1:35:30.397 --> 1:35:32.441
It's so good to see you.

1:35:32.524 --> 1:35:34.318
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Okay.

1:35:34.401 --> 1:35:37.446
-So good. Take care.
-All right.

1:35:44.286 --> 1:35:47.539
<i> Please welcome to the stage</i>

<i>and Intercontinental</i>
<i>WWF Champion Hulk Hogan.</i>

1:35:52.544 --> 1:35:56.840
As artists, we learn to express ourselves
through our instruments.

1:35:56.924 --> 1:36:01.720
Louis Armstrong had his trumpet
and Jimi Hendrix had his guitar.

1:36:01.803 --> 1:36:04.765
And well, my instrument is my voice.

1:36:08.352 --> 1:36:09.770
That's right, Diana.

1:36:09.853 --> 1:36:13.023
And my instruments
are these 24-inch pythons.

1:36:13.106 --> 1:36:16.568
-Whoo!

1:36:16.652 --> 1:36:20.489
No, no, Mary.
That's an oily man.

1:36:22.991 --> 1:36:26.828
And now, the award
you've all been waiting for.

1:36:26.912 --> 1:36:30.415

1:37:23.802 --> 1:37:25.804
This award means so much to me,

1:37:25.888 --> 1:37:28.640
and in front of all
the billions of people watching

1:37:28.724 --> 1:37:33.103
around the world right now,
all I want to say is...

1:37:33.187 --> 1:37:35.439
see, Dad? I told you!

1:37:35.522 --> 1:37:37.941
<i>Yeah! In your face, old man!</i>

1:37:38.025 --> 1:37:41.403
-Huh?

1:37:41.486 --> 1:37:45.908
There are so many people here tonight
that I need to thank.

1:37:45.991 --> 1:37:49.494
People who mean the world to me
and who made me

1:37:49.578 --> 1:37:51.622
everything that I am today.

1:37:51.705 --> 1:37:55.042
But they know who they are, and I'm gonna
thank them all later privately.

1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:00.506
Okay, I'm just gonna wrap things up.
I don't have much time left.

1:38:00.589 --> 1:38:04.927
I-- Y'know, I'm gonna be around
for a good long time.

1:38:05.010 --> 1:38:06.887
You don't have to worry about that.

1:38:06.970 --> 1:38:09.389
You're not gonna get rid of me
that easy.

1:38:13.519 --> 1:38:16.647
-Waiting on your signal.
-<i> Stand by.</i>

1:38:16.730 --> 1:38:20.442
But in my remaining few seconds,
I just wanna say...

1:38:22.653 --> 1:38:24.988
live the life you wanna live.

1:38:25.072 --> 1:38:27.991
You know, be as weird as you wanna be.

1:38:28.075 --> 1:38:30.827
Believe me, you will never
find true happiness

1:38:30.911 --> 1:38:33.872
until you can truly accept who you are.

1:38:35.207 --> 1:38:38.919
And standing before all of you,
right here, right now,

1:38:39.002 --> 1:38:43.423
I can honestly say I have
never been more happy

1:38:43.507 --> 1:38:46.927
or more proud in my entire life.

1:38:48.637 --> 1:38:49.930
Thank you.

1:39:04.653 --> 1:39:06.989
Thank you! Thank you!

1:39:13.579 --> 1:39:14.997
Take the shot.

1:39:21.378 --> 1:39:23.547
Nooo!

1:45:39.882 --> 1:45:41.550
