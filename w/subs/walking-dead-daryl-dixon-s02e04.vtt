they intersected when they did.

57:57.256 --> 57:59.824
I mean, she was the piece
to get Carol to Daryl.

57:59.954 --> 58:08.485
♪

58:08.615 --> 58:11.009
[Carol gasps]

58:11.139 --> 58:12.184
Zabel: There was
a lot of talk about

58:12.314 --> 58:14.360
how Daryl and Carol reunite,

58:14.491 --> 58:16.188
because obviously it was one
of the centerpieces

58:16.318 --> 58:18.277
of the season for us.

58:18.407 --> 58:20.061
I mean, there's a whole story
going on,

58:20.192 --> 58:22.020
but that story
people are waiting on,

58:22.150 --> 58:25.327
and it has to be [bleep]
legendary.

58:27.329 --> 58:28.722
There was
an early version of them

58:28.853 --> 58:30.985
fighting to get back
to each other.

58:31.116 --> 58:32.987
Then it changed into something
a little bit different.

58:33.118 --> 58:34.641
That was Norman's idea.

58:34.772 --> 58:36.513
I grabbed my phone
and I wrote down this idea

58:36.643 --> 58:37.949
that I had about the meeting,

58:38.079 --> 58:39.994
and, I don't know,
it just came to me

58:40.125 --> 58:41.866
while I was asleep,
then at like 11:00 at night,

58:41.996 --> 58:44.172
I sent it to David,

58:44.303 --> 58:46.827
and he and Jason both liked it,
and they took that idea

58:46.958 --> 58:50.135
and they just elevated it
1,000%.

58:50.265 --> 58:51.876
Zabel: And then as we
worked on scenes

58:52.006 --> 58:54.356
around that whole sequence,

58:54.487 --> 58:56.663
we continued talking about it,
Norman and Melissa and I,

58:56.794 --> 58:59.971
and then we ended up with
this version that you see now.

59:01.842 --> 59:03.888
I can see them.

59:04.018 --> 59:05.977
The fireflies.

59:06.107 --> 59:08.370
Poésy: It's a world where
I guess you're very used to

59:08.501 --> 59:11.112
saying goodbye.
I think there's an acceptance.

59:11.243 --> 59:15.073
I don't think she's fighting it.
I think she knows she can't.

59:15.203 --> 59:16.422
They're so beautiful.

59:19.251 --> 59:20.774
Zabel: For the moment
when Isabelle dies,

59:20.905 --> 59:23.124
I think what we wanted was
great dignity,

59:23.255 --> 59:25.126
intelligence, strength,

59:25.257 --> 59:30.131
and a really moving ending
to the character.

59:30.262 --> 59:32.220
Reedus: Isabelle and Daryl's
relationship

59:32.351 --> 59:36.181
has evolved to a point
where he truly cares about her.

59:36.311 --> 59:38.749
Poésy:
It's been so nice, season two.

59:38.879 --> 59:41.882
It's been such a sort of treat
to take Isabelle a bit further,

59:42.013 --> 59:44.232
and knowing that we were taking
these two characters

59:44.363 --> 59:46.539
on a journey

59:46.670 --> 59:48.759
and exploring
their relationship a bit more

59:48.889 --> 59:51.457
was just the greatest luxury.

59:51.588 --> 59:53.154
Zabel:
Isabelle's death hits hard

59:53.285 --> 59:55.113
because she's touched
something within him

59:55.243 --> 59:57.202
that we haven't seen before,

59:57.332 --> 59:59.334
and it's because she's
so different from him,

59:59.465 --> 01:00:02.511
and it's also because she's tied
into this boy that he loves,

01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:05.210
and now he's got to make sure
after that

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.605
not to let the same thing happen
with Laurent.

01:00:08.735 --> 01:00:11.869
Carol: One thing's for sure.
We're not in Ohio anymore.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.133
Zabel: The scenes
we're filming here

01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:17.788
in this little village
are scenes

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:20.355
that involve Daryl and Carol
trying to find a way

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:22.444
to get back to Paris
to find Laurent.

01:00:22.575 --> 01:00:25.447
This village is composed
entirely of old people.

01:00:25.578 --> 01:00:28.363
The young people went away
or died during the apocalypse.

01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:31.845
They all died of natural causes.

01:00:31.976 --> 01:00:33.194
None of them
were killed by zombies.

01:00:33.325 --> 01:00:35.066
They died of old age.

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:38.243
So a lot of the rot
that we apply to the performers

01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:43.030
signified deterioration,
not any sort of violent death.

01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:46.164
Hey. Bonjour,
Madam Picard.

01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:47.731
Zabel: There's a sense of
community in this village

01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:50.211
that has led them
to this unusual decision

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:52.300
to allow some of the people
who have died

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:55.782
and become Walkers
to continue to exist,

01:00:55.913 --> 01:00:57.479
confined within
their properties.

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.656
So it preserves
a very strange, touching,

01:00:59.786 --> 01:01:01.832
but weird sense of community.

01:01:01.962 --> 01:01:06.053
It's one of a number of sort of
signature Walker environments

01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:08.099
that we've created on the show.

The trick with Genet is she has
been a tremendous villain,

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:27.466
so her death has to live up
to the glory of her evil-doings.

01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:29.729

she was doing

the right thing
for the community,

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:35.300

that's it.

her death to be

01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:48.487
just completely horrific,

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:52.099
painful, gut-wrenching.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:55.407
It's a great death.
It's a <i>great</i> death.

01:01:55.537 --> 01:01:57.235
It was the only way
she could die--

01:01:57.365 --> 01:01:59.367

01:02:19.779 --> 01:02:23.174
But I did see what Nicotero
and his team came up with

for when she really goes
bananas on the ground.

01:02:32.226 --> 01:02:34.011
It's horrifying.

01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:37.579
Nicotero: We designed
this animatronic head

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.627
that we did several stages
of makeup on,

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.630
and it was funny--
the phone calls.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.632
I would have to call her
from L.A.

in a very remote village.

Like, "Okay, get a ruler
and put it next to your eyes."

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.387
So we had to go to the town
after to get just the ruler.

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:05.694

pictures of me

01:03:05.825 --> 01:03:06.957

That was very funny.
