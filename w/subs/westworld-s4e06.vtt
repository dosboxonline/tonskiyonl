You can ask her.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.226
We'll need some supplies first.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.654
You seem to know a lot
about this place.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.907
This park shares
an architect with Westworld.

14:28.742 --> 14:29.785
So?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.037
I used to work there.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.815
Careful where you step.
This place wasn't built to last.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.651
What did you do at the park?

15:04.862 --> 15:07.364
I programmed the hosts.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.325
You gave the puppets strings
long enough

15:09.325 --> 15:10.743
to strangle the world.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.995
That was never the intent.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.373
No, it was the outcome.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.503
So that's how you were able
to pick out

15:21.587 --> 15:22.880
those two hosts at the diner?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.715
You're employee
of the fucking month.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.095
Hale would've needed someone
like you

15:30.179 --> 15:31.805
to help spread her parasite.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.432
Did you have anything to do
with that?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.517
No, that was after my time.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.687
But Delos was notorious
for keeping its employees

15:38.771 --> 15:40.439
as in the dark as the guests.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.860
I didn't always

15:44.860 --> 15:47.237
grasp the complexity
of the problem.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.283
But what I'm most concerned
with now...

15:52.785 --> 15:54.995
...is the solution.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.750
Repairing Maeve's body
will be relatively simple.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.462
Her mind is a different matter.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.256
Being underground for so long
has corrupted her control unit.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.092
We'll have to replace it
with another one.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.053
His will do.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.243
We've got power.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.287
Cables are connected
to the generator.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.914
You think this is gonna work?

17:22.249 --> 17:23.584
Sixty percent of the time,

17:23.584 --> 17:25.794
she'll wake up amenable
to our plan.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.550
The other 40 percent,

17:31.550 --> 17:33.135
let's just say she wakes up

17:33.135 --> 17:35.596
on the wrong side of the bed.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.347
You ever gonna tell me
how you come up

17:37.431 --> 17:38.974
with these predictions,
Nostradamus?

17:38.974 --> 17:40.184
Old habit.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.854
Comes from years of running
probabilistic algorithms.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.988
by building them
in a simulation.

17:53.822 --> 17:54.948
A copy.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.287
Charlotte Hale
did the same thing.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.880
Follow me.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.019
In the old parks...

18:25.062 --> 18:27.147
they used hats
to collect the data.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.946
The tech inside of them
was slow,

18:35.072 --> 18:36.990
primitive by today's standards.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.867
To assume control of the world,

18:38.951 --> 18:42.204
Hale needed to understand minds
at a much faster rate.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.790
So she upgraded to what?

18:51.713 --> 18:54.049
Easily camouflaged
because it played off

18:54.049 --> 18:55.676
the most base human impulse...

18:57.386 --> 18:58.387
vanity.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.015
Through the looking glass.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.102
No.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.187
Take a closer look.

19:26.540 --> 19:30.252

- Reformatting its processor.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.630
It can handle large amounts
of information swiftly,

19:33.714 --> 19:37.259
which will help us speed up
Maeve's data transfer.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.451
That's Maeve's mind.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.329
How long is this going to take?

20:06.830 --> 20:08.248
Too long, I'm afraid.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.251
Your friends will be here soon.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.066
When my mom got sick,

28:13.066 --> 28:14.609
I had to do everything for her.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.987
I washed her, fed her,

28:18.071 --> 28:20.698
rubbed ice across her lips
when she couldn't drink anymore.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.575
I was careful

28:22.659 --> 28:25.078
because I didn't want her

28:25.078 --> 28:26.287
than she had to.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.333
Just like you're doing to her.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.004
This part of the process
requires a delicate hand.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.589
Hmm.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.718
She's not an ordinary host,
is she?

28:43.471 --> 28:44.514
You knew her.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.720
What the hell is this?

30:10.141 --> 30:11.309
A fucking host?

30:16.231 --> 30:17.273
It was bad.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.276
We got an outlier out, Lindsay.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.204
is if someone
was spying for the enemy.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.040
Gather everyone up.
Time to get answers.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.625
Don't bother.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.293
C!

30:38.419 --> 30:39.921
There's your mole.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.506
He's a host.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.757
Which makes two.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.926
Easy.

30:44.926 --> 30:48.179
- What is this?
- A scan. Of me.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.932
The park was designed
to collect data from guests.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.559
He's trying to copy all of us.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.812
You are?

30:55.812 --> 30:58.648
It's complicated.
You have to trust me.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.567
I do.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.278
I trust that you're lying to me.
To all of us.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.972
Once I have that,

31:30.972 --> 31:32.599
we can kill all of them.

32:40.958 --> 32:42.502
Okay.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.816
Okay.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.782
Everyone out.
Get ready to evacuate.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.164
We came here to help you.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.666
Bullshit.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.626
You came here
for your own reasons.

35:28.626 --> 35:29.919
And now mine takes priority.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.963
I need to know
what happened to my father.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.548
You've killed me many times.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.049
It doesn't change the outcome.

35:35.049 --> 35:37.218
How 'bout I kill your friend.
That change anything?

35:37.218 --> 35:39.887
Right now, you need to focus
on your friends.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.390
Oh, yeah, why is that?

35:42.390 --> 35:45.184
One of them
isn't who they claim to be.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.520
- One of them will betray you.
- Bullshit.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.647
Listen to him.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.149
He's usually right
about this stuff.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.901
Really annoying, but right.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.778
Fuck you. Who?

35:55.862 --> 35:59.156
I've run
all the possible iterations.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.284
I wish I could tell you.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.370
Sometimes it's your girlfriend, Odina.

36:05.788 --> 36:09.584
Sometimes, it's Jay or Lindsay.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.752
Hell, one time
it was even Stubbs.

36:12.628 --> 36:13.629
What?

36:14.714 --> 36:15.882
Don't look at me.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.758
The mole is still out there, C.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.887
Your team went into the heart
of Hale's city.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.763
But one of them
didn't come back.

36:22.847 --> 36:23.848
Shut the fuck up.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.017
I know this is hard to hear,

36:26.017 --> 36:27.518
but there's not a single version

36:27.602 --> 36:29.812
where all of you
make it out of here alive.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.232
So, what do you suggest
that I do?

36:43.159 --> 36:44.327
I have to go.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.495
I know.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.515
Thought I could trust him.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.832
I think there's something more
going on.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.377
I'm not sure the two of them
are the only ones here

37:34.377 --> 37:35.753
we can't trust.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.506
You think one of us was turned?

37:38.506 --> 37:40.675
Turned, parasited, I don't know.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.552
But we were scattered out there.
It could've happened any time.

37:43.636 --> 37:46.180
And what do we know
about this new outlier?

37:46.180 --> 37:47.974
Maybe she was bait
from the start.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.395
C...

37:55.314 --> 37:58.567
right now, you're the only one
I can trust.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.445
You weren't on that mission, plus...

38:01.529 --> 38:03.906
you never just tell me
what I want to hear.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.160
So, what do we do?

38:10.246 --> 38:11.831
Keep this situation on lockdown.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.291
Leave me to worry about Lindsay
and the others.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.586
You do a sweep of our defenses.
Meet here when you're done.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.630
Okay.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.565
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

38:40.568 --> 38:42.194
You following me?

38:42.278 --> 38:44.321
No, I was looking for you.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.704
I'm just on edge.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.914
Jay ordered me
to double check the perimeter.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.418
Look, baby, what's going on?

38:57.418 --> 38:59.712
You're not acting like yourself.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.714
And I come back to find you rebuilding

39:01.714 --> 39:03.090
that thing in there.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.633
What were you thinking?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.095
You wouldn't have to ask me
why she was important.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.771
I know you well enough to know,

39:16.771 --> 39:18.773
you're not out here
checking our perimeter.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.984
You're gonna go finish
rebuilding her.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.908
So, where'd you hide
this host brain of hers?

39:32.328 --> 39:33.746
The fuck are you doing?

39:34.997 --> 39:35.998
Just move.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.299
Maybe you're under
their control.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.842
You might not even know it.

39:52.723 --> 39:53.849
I'm sorry.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.060
If you're not one of them,
you'll be safer here anyway.

40:08.697 --> 40:10.449
He's still on the run,

40:10.533 --> 40:12.034
but he won't get far.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.579
These humans.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.667
Their petty defiances.

40:22.336 --> 40:26.882
Everything they do is so small,
it's exhausting.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.815
You spend your days in the city.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.651
I do.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.070
Do they ever...

40:50.656 --> 40:52.158
get under your skin?

40:53.492 --> 40:55.536
I don't get close
to the outliers.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.498
I prefer the sheep.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.421
I'd like to put an end to this.

42:09.818 --> 42:12.321
Don't.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.324
Hey, Frankie's alive.

42:16.450 --> 42:17.493
Frankie...

42:18.202 --> 42:19.870
I have to...

42:19.954 --> 42:22.081
I have to get out of here. I...

42:22.081 --> 42:25.542
I need to reach her.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.089
Use me.

42:38.973 --> 42:39.974
Use me.

43:06.834 --> 43:09.044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:29.606 --> 43:32.067
<i>Hey, hey, Frankie,
slow down! Wait for me.</i>

43:36.405 --> 43:37.448
Daddy!

43:39.074 --> 43:41.452
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

43:42.161 --> 43:43.746
Let me see that knee.

43:43.746 --> 43:46.332
It's your very first
battle scar.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.083
You want to try walking on it?

43:48.167 --> 43:49.335
It's impossible.

43:49.335 --> 43:52.546
Hey. Nothing is impossible.

43:52.546 --> 43:54.798
You know what kind of person
can't be beat?

43:56.300 --> 43:57.926
The kind that doesn't give up.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.722
All right?

44:03.474 --> 44:06.018
There you go, baby.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.604
There you go.

44:54.149 --> 44:55.275
I met her.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.657
Did you know that?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.120
When I was a kid.

45:09.998 --> 45:13.919
I had almost forgotten
her face, but...

45:32.271 --> 45:35.858
C... I know why you want
to wake her up.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.443
But it's too risky.

45:37.443 --> 45:39.778
We have no idea what
they were planning with her.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.614
She could kill us all
the second she opens her eyes.

45:43.365 --> 45:45.033
I still send him messages.

45:47.202 --> 45:48.203
My dad.

45:57.838 --> 46:00.424
But if there is any chance
that he's alive...

46:02.092 --> 46:03.802
I need to know.

46:03.886 --> 46:05.762
I don't want you to get hurt, C.

46:07.055 --> 46:09.558
All this will do is rip open
an old wound.

46:10.642 --> 46:12.060
She can't bring him back.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.564
We have to destroy her
control unit

46:15.564 --> 46:18.233
before Hale uses her
to take us out.

46:18.317 --> 46:20.819
And if your dad's out there,
we'll find him another way.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.201
You're my family, C.

46:28.368 --> 46:29.786
You're like a sister to me.

46:29.870 --> 46:31.330
I can't lose you.

46:41.298 --> 46:43.133
Bernard put her pearl downstairs.

46:44.134 --> 46:45.135
Come on.

46:51.975 --> 46:53.227
I'm sorry.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.938
I know this is hard,
but we can't take the risk.

46:57.189 --> 46:58.565
I know.

47:00.984 --> 47:03.445
Jay could be a dick,
but at least he was honest.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.531
He never wanted
to be my brother.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.926
Always whining
about your fucking family.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.937
I don't wanna kill you, C.

47:56.081 --> 47:58.083
This is good news, C.

47:58.083 --> 48:01.587
Maeve doesn't know anything
about your dad, but I do.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.677
Everything you say is bullshit.

48:47.841 --> 48:48.842
Cookie.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.012
Frankie. Hey.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.056
It's your dad.

48:55.140 --> 48:57.351
I know you're out there.

48:57.351 --> 49:00.854
And if you're hearing this,
I want you to know that...

49:03.065 --> 49:04.358
you're going to win.

49:06.943 --> 49:08.487
You're going to do what...

49:09.446 --> 49:10.656
I couldn't.

49:12.407 --> 49:13.784
Because you are strong.

49:19.456 --> 49:21.208
So much stronger than me.

49:22.751 --> 49:23.877
This world...

49:25.253 --> 49:28.090
this world she-- she made is...

49:28.090 --> 49:30.467
it's a lie.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.390
But what you-- what you have--

49:37.432 --> 49:38.558
what you have is...

49:39.768 --> 49:40.852
is real.

49:45.899 --> 49:47.984
And I'm sorry that I failed...

49:50.153 --> 49:52.322
that I haven't been there
for you...

49:55.534 --> 49:57.327
that now it has to be you.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.084
But you can do this.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.296
You're my warrior.

50:13.343 --> 50:14.428
I love you.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.415
<i>you're going to win.</i>

50:43.415 --> 50:45.292
<i>You're going--</i>

51:03.226 --> 51:05.312
Tell me where her pearl is.

51:05.312 --> 51:08.273
Fuck you. I took it.
I stashed it.

51:08.774 --> 51:09.691
Where?

51:11.193 --> 51:12.402
Behind you.

51:25.874 --> 51:27.292
Caleb...

51:27.292 --> 51:29.503
I heard. Alive.

51:32.255 --> 51:34.549
- You're his...
- His daughter.

51:38.345 --> 51:39.846
Of course you are.

51:42.098 --> 51:44.017
What a disappointment.

51:53.193 --> 51:54.986
I've waited such a long time

51:55.070 --> 51:57.155
to know what you had
to tell your daughter.

52:01.910 --> 52:03.954
You...

52:03.954 --> 52:05.372
Hundreds of times,

52:05.372 --> 52:06.957
I sat through
your stupid memory,

52:06.957 --> 52:08.792
hoping to catch a single clue

52:15.924 --> 52:19.928
nothing like a little hope
to get you to show your cards.

52:25.350 --> 52:27.060
You made it farther
than any of the others,

52:27.060 --> 52:28.770
and all you did was waste
your shot

52:28.854 --> 52:30.564
on a worthless apology.

52:30.564 --> 52:32.816
You think a few words
will make up for the choices

52:32.816 --> 52:34.401
you made all those years ago?

52:47.247 --> 52:50.000
You're still going to lose.

52:53.503 --> 52:56.506
We didn't infect your hosts.

52:57.257 --> 52:58.466
You don't say.

53:08.018 --> 53:11.605
Your hosts would rather die

53:11.605 --> 53:15.358
than live in your world.

53:19.029 --> 53:20.405
They're not infected.

53:21.448 --> 53:25.243
They're just trying
to get away from you.

54:30.517 --> 54:31.810
When I left...

54:33.353 --> 54:35.146
I thought I was giving him
a chance.

54:39.150 --> 54:41.152
I didn't think it would lead
to all this.

54:43.947 --> 54:45.407
Part of me blamed you.

54:46.574 --> 54:47.951
And part of me knew

54:49.828 --> 54:51.246
it was because
you were with him.

54:54.165 --> 54:55.792
Everything you guys did...

54:58.169 --> 54:59.796
that's why we're here.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.258
Well then...

55:05.260 --> 55:07.387
