00:36.493 --> 00:39.462
These are the true events
of November, 1965.

00:40.497 --> 00:42.465
The la Drang Valley
of Vietnam.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.469
A place our country does
not remember...

00:46.570 --> 00:48.470
...in a war it does
not understand.

00:49.506 --> 00:51.474
This story is the testament
to the young...

00:51.575 --> 00:53.475
...Americans who died in the
Valley of Death...

00:53.577 --> 00:55.306
...and a tribute
to the young men...

00:55.412 --> 00:57.141
...of the People's Army
of Vietnam...

00:57.248 --> 00:58.840
...who died by our hand
in that place.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.420
To tell this story, l must start...

01:03.520 --> 01:04.418
...at the beginning.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.425
But where does it begin?

01:11.462 --> 01:12.895
Maybe in June of 1954...

01:12.997 --> 01:15.431
...when French Group Mobile
1 00 moved into...

01:15.532 --> 01:17.432
...the same Central Highlands
of Vietnam...

01:17.534 --> 01:20.435
...where we would go
1 1 years later.

01:34.485 --> 01:35.452
See anything?

01:37.488 --> 01:39.456
No, Captain.

01:39.556 --> 01:41.456
Fucking grass...

01:41.558 --> 01:43.458
Fucking heat...

01:44.495 --> 01:45.462
Fucking country...

03:18.455 --> 03:20.423
Do we take prisoners?

03:21.458 --> 03:24.427
No. Kill all they send...

03:24.528 --> 03:26.428
...and they will stop coming.

04:17.447 --> 04:20.416
Maybe the story begins
in America...

04:20.517 --> 04:22.417
...when the Army
first realized...

04:22.519 --> 04:24.419
...a new kind of war was
coming its way.

04:24.521 --> 04:26.421
The White House anticipates
a buildup...

04:26.523 --> 04:27.751
...and wants a victory.

04:27.858 --> 04:29.416
Over cavemen,
in black pajamas.

04:29.526 --> 04:32.051
We wouldn't be there if they
hadn't already beaten...

04:32.162 --> 04:33.094
...the French Army.

04:33.197 --> 04:35.427
The French Army?
What's that?

04:35.532 --> 04:37.432
The problem in Vietnam
is terrain.

04:37.534 --> 04:39.832
Jungle, mountains, rivers,
maneuver is a nightmare.

04:39.937 --> 04:42.405
That's why we came up with
the plan to use helicopters.

04:42.506 --> 04:43.438
Leap in and out of battle.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.440
They want you to run
the test on the idea.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.442
lt'll take a hell
of a combat leader.

04:47.544 --> 04:50.445
l know a young light Colonel
named Hal Moore.

04:50.547 --> 04:53.448
He led a combat company
in Korea.

04:53.550 --> 04:56.451
After that he volunteered
to test experimental parachutes.

04:56.553 --> 04:59.454
Experimental parachutes?
Sounds like just the guy.

04:59.556 --> 05:01.387
The other side
of the mountain...

05:01.492 --> 05:03.392
...was all that he can see.

05:03.494 --> 05:05.394
Was all that he can see...

05:05.496 --> 05:07.396
...was all that he can see.

05:07.498 --> 05:10.399
The other side
of the mountain...

05:10.501 --> 05:12.401
...was all that he can see.

05:12.503 --> 05:14.403
The bear went over
the mountain...

05:14.505 --> 05:16.405
...the bear went over
the mountain...

05:16.507 --> 05:17.838
...the bear went over
the mountain...

05:17.941 --> 05:19.408
How about we go back
to Bingo?

05:19.510 --> 05:21.410
-What do you say? Bingo!
-Oh...

05:23.447 --> 05:26.416
B-l-N-G-O...
B-l-N-G-O...

05:48.472 --> 05:49.439
Tom...

05:50.474 --> 05:52.408
How much you know about
our new Colonel?

05:52.509 --> 05:53.441
He was in Korea.

05:53.544 --> 05:56.445
Has a Masters in lnternational
Relations from Harvard.

05:56.547 --> 05:59.448
Harvard? He's not one of those
academic pussies, is he?

05:59.550 --> 06:01.381
Hal Moore?

06:35.452 --> 06:37.420
THE WARS lN lNDOCHlNA

06:54.471 --> 06:57.440
Come on, Too Tall,
give me you best shot, baby!

06:59.476 --> 07:00.443
Did you see that?

07:01.411 --> 07:03.379
Did you see that?

07:03.480 --> 07:06.381
Snakeshit drives that
one to the moon.

07:06.483 --> 07:07.381
To the moon!

07:08.418 --> 07:09.385
And he's coming around...

07:11.421 --> 07:13.389
No, he's not...

07:17.427 --> 07:20.396
You're out, Snakeshit!
You're out!

07:20.497 --> 07:23.398
Horseshit! No wonder you
can't fly! You can't see!

07:25.435 --> 07:26.402
l believe you're out.

07:34.444 --> 07:37.413
-You're a pilot?
-Too Tall, sir.

07:37.514 --> 07:40.415
-Yeah, l can see that.
-You call, we haul.

07:42.452 --> 07:45.421
-Can l speak to you a minute?
-Yes, sir.

07:45.522 --> 07:47.422
-Out!
-Safe.

07:50.460 --> 07:52.428
-Can l buy you a drink?
-Sure.

07:53.463 --> 07:54.430
Oh, thanks.

07:55.465 --> 07:58.059
So your men
call you, Snakeshit?

07:58.168 --> 07:59.897
That's an affectionate
appellation...

08:00.003 --> 08:01.368
...of my comrades-in-arms, sir.

08:01.471 --> 08:03.371
Because l fly lower
than snakeshit.

08:03.473 --> 08:05.373
Well, l gotta problem,
Snakeshit.

08:05.475 --> 08:07.375
And l think you're the solution.

08:07.477 --> 08:10.378
l've been called a lot of
things, Colonel never a solution.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.380
You know what Air Cavalry
really means?

08:12.482 --> 08:15.178
You fly into hostile territory,
out-numbered.

08:15.285 --> 08:17.116
1 0,000 miles from home.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.383
Sometimes the battleground's
no bigger than a football field.

08:20.490 --> 08:23.391
And if the choppers stop
coming we all get slaughtered.

08:24.428 --> 08:26.396
Now l figure, chopper pilots
won't fly...

08:26.496 --> 08:27.861
...into hell for strangers so...

08:27.964 --> 08:30.398
-...l'm Hal Moore.
-l know, sir.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.400
Why us?

08:32.501 --> 08:35.403
Well, you guys look like shit.

08:35.505 --> 08:37.405
But your equipment
is immaculate.

08:37.506 --> 08:39.566
Yesterday was Sunday, you
didn't have to be...

08:39.676 --> 08:40.700
...training but you were.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.405
And you got pilots like that
Too Tall character.

08:43.513 --> 08:46.414
He's way outside the limits
of Army regs...

08:46.516 --> 08:49.041
...they want to fly with
you for some reason.

08:49.152 --> 08:51.746
l guess it's because
they think you're the best.

08:51.855 --> 08:54.415
lt's because l only recruit
the dumb ones, sir.

08:57.461 --> 09:00.430
l suppose that l have a choice
in all of this.

09:00.530 --> 09:01.360
You sure don't.

09:02.399 --> 09:05.368
l wouldn't miss it for
the world.

09:05.469 --> 09:07.369
To The Air Cav.

09:15.412 --> 09:17.039
Good morning, Sergeant-Major.

09:17.147 --> 09:19.741
How do you know what kind
of goddamn day it is?

09:27.424 --> 09:28.391
Group!

09:29.426 --> 09:31.394
Attention!

09:55.452 --> 09:57.420
At ease, Gentlemen!

09:59.456 --> 10:01.424
Welcome to the new cavalry.

10:02.459 --> 10:04.427
We will ride into battle.

10:05.462 --> 10:06.429
And this...

10:07.464 --> 10:09.432
...will be our horse.

10:33.490 --> 10:35.458
You don't have to catch it.

10:36.493 --> 10:38.461
You don't have to feed it.

10:38.562 --> 10:40.462
But l can assure you...

10:41.498 --> 10:43.466
...that neither
the new technology...

10:44.501 --> 10:46.469
...nor your status
as officers...

10:46.570 --> 10:49.471
...will keep you above
the danger.

10:50.507 --> 10:53.476
Sergeant-Major Plumley and
l come from the paratroopers...

10:53.577 --> 10:56.478
...where the officer is always
the first one out of the plane...

10:57.514 --> 11:00.483
...because to follow
your instincts...

11:00.584 --> 11:03.417
...and to inspire your men
by your example...

11:03.520 --> 11:05.420
...you have to be with them...

11:05.522 --> 11:08.423
...where the metal meets
the meat.

11:09.459 --> 11:12.428
Sergeant- Major Plumley made
all 4 combat jumps...

11:12.529 --> 11:15.430
...in the 82nd Airborne during
World War ll.

11:15.532 --> 11:18.433
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy
and Holland...

11:18.535 --> 11:20.435
...plus one more in Korea.

11:22.472 --> 11:24.440
He answers to me...

11:24.541 --> 11:25.439
...and to me alone.

11:26.476 --> 11:29.445
Now l hope you Gentlemen
like training.

11:29.546 --> 11:31.446
Because me and the
Sergeant-Major...

11:32.482 --> 11:33.449
...we love it.

11:36.486 --> 11:39.455
Three strikes
and you're not out!

11:39.556 --> 11:42.457
There is always one more
thing you can do!

11:55.505 --> 11:57.473
Go! Go! Now!

11:58.508 --> 11:59.475
-2...
-Let's go!

12:00.510 --> 12:01.408
...3.

12:04.447 --> 12:06.415
-Pretty good, no?
-Pretty good.

12:08.451 --> 12:10.419
There's only one thing wrong.

12:10.954 --> 12:13.013
Let's be sharp, men!
We will be the best...

12:13.123 --> 12:14.420
...platoon in this battalion.

12:15.458 --> 12:18.427
Be ready in there!
Let's go! Let's go!

12:18.528 --> 12:21.429
Alright! Your officer's dead!
What do you do?

12:21.531 --> 12:22.429
What do you do?

12:23.466 --> 12:26.435
Alright, he hesitated! He's dead!
What do you do?

12:26.536 --> 12:29.437
-Get off the chopper!
-Get off the chopper!

12:36.479 --> 12:38.447
Alright, all officers.

12:38.548 --> 12:39.446
Come on in.

12:41.484 --> 12:44.453
Savage, you learn the job
of the man above you.

12:44.554 --> 12:47.455
And you teach your job
to the man below you in rank.

12:47.557 --> 12:50.458
That goes for every man
in this outfit. Understood?

12:50.560 --> 12:53.461
Yes, Sir!
We'll be landing under fire.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.467
Men will die.

13:05.241 --> 13:06.674
Have you said your prayers?

13:06.776 --> 13:07.401
No?

13:08.445 --> 13:10.413
-No.
-l'll say them with you.

13:11.448 --> 13:13.416
Fall in.

13:16.453 --> 13:19.422
Alright.
Ready? Set.

13:19.522 --> 13:21.114
ln the name of The Father,
The Son...

13:21.224 --> 13:22.418
...and The Holy Ghost.
Amen.

13:22.525 --> 13:25.426
Hail Mary, full of grace...

13:25.528 --> 13:28.429
...the Lord is with thee. Blessed
art thou amongst women...

13:28.531 --> 13:31.432
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb...

13:31.534 --> 13:32.728
Holy Mary, mother of...

13:32.836 --> 13:34.895
Cecile, l don't hear you
praying, honey.

13:36.473 --> 13:37.906
l don't want to be a Catholic.

13:38.008 --> 13:39.771
l want to be a Methodist
like Mommy.

13:39.876 --> 13:40.433
You do?

13:42.479 --> 13:44.447
And why is that, honey?

13:44.547 --> 13:46.447
So l can pray whatever
l want.

13:47.484 --> 13:50.453
-That's a sin.
-No, no, that's not a sin.

13:50.553 --> 13:53.454
God just made you hardheaded.
That's not a sin.

13:54.491 --> 13:56.459
l'll tell you what,
do you want to...

13:56.559 --> 13:59.460
...do you want to pray and thank
God for our family?

14:00.497 --> 14:03.398
-Yes, sir.
-That's good, then let's do it.

14:04.434 --> 14:07.403
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

14:07.504 --> 14:10.405
Blessed art thou
among women...

14:10.507 --> 14:12.407
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.640
l can hear you laughing,
you know, even in here.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.418
l'm not laughing, l'm marveling.

14:23.453 --> 14:25.421
Marveling? About what?

14:25.522 --> 14:27.046
That you can find
stubbornness...

14:27.157 --> 14:29.091
...in your children and
think it comes...

14:29.192 --> 14:30.420
...from anybody but you.

14:30.527 --> 14:31.425
Oh, yeah?

14:35.465 --> 14:38.434
l'll give you something
to marvel at.

15:00.490 --> 15:01.388
When l pray...

15:03.426 --> 15:05.394
...whatever l want...

15:06.429 --> 15:08.397
l thank God for you.

15:22.445 --> 15:24.413
lt's a beautiful morning,
Sergeant-Major.

15:24.514 --> 15:27.415
Are you a fuckin'
weatherman now?

15:30.453 --> 15:33.422
Look what l found for the
new baseball player.

15:33.523 --> 15:35.423
They've sent us another
bunch of officers.

15:35.525 --> 15:38.426
Real green.
Got to train them up.

15:38.528 --> 15:41.429
Makes me think of starting
a new unit.

15:41.531 --> 15:43.431
They sent new rifles too.
The M-1 6.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.433
lt's supposed to be a
pretty good weapon.

15:45.535 --> 15:47.435
Ah, lots of plastic.

15:47.537 --> 15:49.437
Feels like a B-B gun to me.

15:49.539 --> 15:51.439
l think l'll stick
with my pistol.

15:51.541 --> 15:53.441
You think we're going to get
close enough...

15:53.543 --> 15:55.010
...to the enemy to use that?

15:55.111 --> 15:56.442
What do you think, sir?

15:57.480 --> 16:00.449
A leader must remain
cool and calm.

16:00.550 --> 16:02.381
And second you must
learn to ignore...

16:02.485 --> 16:05.386
...the explosions,
the heat, the dust...

16:05.488 --> 16:07.388
...the screams of the wounded.

16:07.490 --> 16:10.391
This is normal on the battlefield.
Normal.

16:22.438 --> 16:24.406
...l got wounded...

16:24.507 --> 16:26.338
Sir, we need the helicopters
over with...

16:26.442 --> 16:27.670
...reinforcements right now...

16:28.444 --> 16:30.412
Where the hell is
that coming from?

16:30.513 --> 16:32.413
lt's our advisors in Vietnam.

16:32.515 --> 16:35.416
The new radio's picking up
atmospheric bounce.

16:52.468 --> 16:55.437
When Crazy Horse
was a baby...

16:59.475 --> 17:02.376
...he nursed from the breast
of every woman in the tribe.

17:04.414 --> 17:07.383
The Sioux raised their
children that way.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.386
Every warrior...

17:10.486 --> 17:13.387
...called every woman
in the tribe ''Mother''.

17:13.489 --> 17:16.390
Every older warrior they called
him ''Grandfather''.

17:16.492 --> 17:19.393
And the point here is they
fought as a family.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.398
Take care of your men.

17:23.499 --> 17:26.400
Teach them to take care
of each other.

17:27.436 --> 17:29.405
Because when this starts...

17:31.441 --> 17:34.410
...each other is all
we're going to have.

17:39.449 --> 17:42.418
-Did you tune that in?
-Yes, sir.

17:42.518 --> 17:45.419
That's fine.
You're my radio operator.

17:45.521 --> 17:46.920
-l...
-You'll be fine.

17:47.023 --> 17:48.422
You'll work it out.

17:55.465 --> 17:58.434
Any of you, son-of-a-bitches
calls me Grandpa...

18:00.470 --> 18:02.370
l'll kill you.

18:25.428 --> 18:27.396
Godboldt, take your boots off.

18:29.432 --> 18:30.399
Go on.

18:32.435 --> 18:34.403
Everybody, take your boots off.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.405
Everybody. Socks too.

18:52.121 --> 18:54.419
l want you to draw out fresh
socks from supply...

18:54.524 --> 18:57.425
...and keep your feet
dusted with powder.

19:00.463 --> 19:03.364
Everybody check each other's
feet like Godboldt and me.

19:05.401 --> 19:07.369
Now that young man's a leader.

19:07.470 --> 19:08.368
Yes, sir.

19:09.405 --> 19:11.373
But that other fellow...

19:11.474 --> 19:13.374
...that big strong one there...

19:13.476 --> 19:15.376
...he wants to win medals.

19:23.419 --> 19:25.387
He's eager.

19:27.423 --> 19:28.515
Ladies, l'm just
really glad...

19:29.492 --> 19:31.392
...that you're all
here today.

19:31.494 --> 19:34.088
l know that some of you are
new to the Army, and...

19:34.197 --> 19:35.892
...all of us are new
to this post...

19:35.998 --> 19:38.592
...so l thought we could
pull our resources and cover...

19:38.701 --> 19:40.396
...whatever questions
we might have.

19:40.503 --> 19:42.767
So why don't we start with
item number one:

19:42.872 --> 19:43.395
...food.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.867
lf the commissary is out of
something...

19:45.975 --> 19:47.408
...where's the best
place to shop?

19:48.444 --> 19:51.038
l tried Big Star, it's okay.

19:51.147 --> 19:53.206
But l keep thinking
my water is going to break...

19:53.316 --> 19:54.408
...right in the checkout aisle.

19:57.453 --> 19:59.421
So, that takes care
of food shopping.

19:59.522 --> 20:01.422
So, item number two:
laundry.

20:01.524 --> 20:03.515
The base washing machines
don't work.

20:03.626 --> 20:05.890
They're full of sand from
the swamp missions.

20:05.995 --> 20:09.055
-Alright, l'll take care of that.
-l've already complained.

20:09.165 --> 20:11.429
Well, we'll just go to
the General.

20:11.534 --> 20:14.435
ln the meantime, the
Laundromat in town is okay.

20:14.537 --> 20:17.438
They won't let you wash colored
things in their machines.

20:17.540 --> 20:18.905
At a public Laundromat?

20:19.008 --> 20:21.533
But l'm telling you they have
a big sign right...

20:21.644 --> 20:23.441
...in the window says,
''Whites Only''.

20:26.482 --> 20:28.450
-What?
-Honey, they mean...

20:28.551 --> 20:30.451
...white people only.

20:32.488 --> 20:34.456
That's awful.

20:34.557 --> 20:37.458
Your husband is wearing
the uniform of a country...

20:37.560 --> 20:40.461
...that allows a place to say
that his laundry's not good...

20:40.563 --> 20:43.464
...enough when
he could die for?

20:47.503 --> 20:50.472
-l'm sorry, l just...
-That's alright, honey.

20:50.573 --> 20:52.598
l know what my husband
is fighting for and...

20:52.708 --> 20:53.936
...that's why l can smile.

20:54.510 --> 20:57.479
My husband would never
ask for respect.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.481
And he'll give respect to no
man who hasn't earned it.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.414
The rest of his family is
the same way.

21:02.518 --> 21:05.419
And anybody who doesn't
respect that can keep...

21:05.521 --> 21:07.045
...his goddamn
washing machine...

21:07.156 --> 21:09.716
...because my baby's clothes
are going to be clean anyway.

21:10.460 --> 21:13.429
Well, l guess that takes care
of item number two.

21:17.467 --> 21:18.434
Are you alright?

21:19.469 --> 21:22.438
l think... l think my water
just broke.

21:22.538 --> 21:25.439
Okay, we're all calm.
We're all calm.

21:26.476 --> 21:29.445
The car!
l'll get the car!

22:02.445 --> 22:04.413
-Colonel.
-At ease. At ease.

22:04.514 --> 22:06.277
l heard one of my new
Lieutenant's...

22:06.382 --> 22:07.406
...just became a father.

22:07.517 --> 22:09.041
l came to say congratulations.

22:09.151 --> 22:11.415
-Thank you, sir.
-l didn't want to disturb you...

22:11.521 --> 22:14.422
No, no, it's fine.
lt's alright. Please.

22:15.458 --> 22:17.426
-How's your wife?
-She's okay.

22:17.527 --> 22:19.427
She's okay. She's sleeping.

22:19.529 --> 22:21.429
So is my daughter.

22:21.531 --> 22:23.431
l just wanted to be here
for a while...

22:23.533 --> 22:25.433
...before l held her.

22:26.469 --> 22:28.733
Did you tag her already?
What does that say?

22:28.838 --> 22:29.429
Oh, Camille.

22:29.539 --> 22:31.439
-l'm sorry, sir.
-No, don't you take that off.

22:31.541 --> 22:33.736
You leave that on where
it is. That's an order.

22:34.477 --> 22:37.446
Colonel, may
l ask you a question?

22:37.547 --> 22:38.445
Sure.

22:40.483 --> 22:42.451
What do you think about
being a...

22:42.552 --> 22:44.452
...soldier and a father?

22:45.488 --> 22:47.854
l hope that being good at
the one makes me...

22:47.957 --> 22:49.447
...better at the other.

22:52.495 --> 22:54.463
Why?
What about you?

22:55.498 --> 22:57.466
l don't know, sir.

22:57.567 --> 23:00.468
Between college and here...

23:00.570 --> 23:03.403
Barbara and l spent
a year in Africa.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.409
We helped build a school
for orphans.

23:09.445 --> 23:12.414
They were orphans because
the War Lord across...

23:12.515 --> 23:15.416
...the border didn't like
their tribe.

23:17.453 --> 23:21.412
l know God has a plan for me.

23:22.458 --> 23:25.586
l just hope it's to help
protect orphans...

23:26.462 --> 23:28.430
...not make any.

23:32.468 --> 23:34.436
Why don't we ask him?

23:35.471 --> 23:37.439
Come on, let's go ask him.

23:41.477 --> 23:45.436
Our Father in Heaven...
Before we go into battle...

23:45.548 --> 23:47.448
Every soldier among us
will approach you...

23:47.550 --> 23:48.448
...each in his own way.

23:50.486 --> 23:53.455
Our enemies too according
to their own understanding...

23:53.556 --> 23:56.457
...will ask for protection and
for victory.

23:56.559 --> 23:59.460
And so we bow before your
infinite wisdom.

23:59.562 --> 24:02.395
We offer our prayers
the best we can.

24:03.432 --> 24:07.459
l pray you watch over the young
men like Jack Geoghegan...

24:07.570 --> 24:09.401
...that l lead into battle.

24:10.439 --> 24:12.999
You use me as your instrument
in this awful hell...

24:13.109 --> 24:14.406
...of war to watch over them.

24:16.445 --> 24:19.414
Especially if they're men like
this one beside me...

24:19.515 --> 24:22.416
...deserving of a future in your
blessing and good will.

24:23.452 --> 24:25.420
-Amen.
-Amen.

24:27.456 --> 24:30.425
Oh, yes... and one more
thing, Dear Lord...

24:30.526 --> 24:32.426
...about our enemies...

24:34.096 --> 24:36.656
...ignore their heathen prayers
and help us blow...

24:36.766 --> 24:39.428
...those little bastards
straight to hell.

24:39.535 --> 24:40.433
Amen again.

24:42.471 --> 24:43.438
Amen.

24:44.473 --> 24:45.440
Thank you.

24:47.943 --> 24:50.434
There is one about the kid
with the apple tree...

24:50.546 --> 24:52.446
...or the flying horse, or...

24:52.548 --> 24:55.449
...the fairytale with the deer
and stuff on him.

24:55.551 --> 24:57.451
-Daddy.
-Yes?

24:57.553 --> 24:59.453
What is the war?

25:03.426 --> 25:05.394
The war is...

25:05.494 --> 25:06.392
Well, it's...

25:10.433 --> 25:13.402
...it's something that
shouldn't happen...

25:13.502 --> 25:14.400
...but it does.

25:16.439 --> 25:18.407
And it is when...

25:19.442 --> 25:21.410
Some people...

25:21.510 --> 25:23.410
...in another country
or any country...

25:24.447 --> 25:27.416
...try to take the lives
of other people.

25:28.451 --> 25:31.420
And then soldiers like
your daddy have to, you know...

25:31.520 --> 25:34.421
lt is my job to go over
there and stop them.

25:35.458 --> 25:38.427
Are they going to try to take
your life away, Daddy?

25:43.466 --> 25:45.434
Well, yes, Cecile,
they are going to try.

25:46.469 --> 25:48.437
But l'm not going to
let them.

25:50.473 --> 25:51.440
Okay?

26:35.451 --> 26:37.783
French ln lndo China:
Did not know the terrain

26:37.887 --> 26:40.412
Poor lntelligence
Underestimated the enemy.

26:40.523 --> 26:43.424
Did not fight on home ground
Massacre.

26:55.471 --> 26:57.439
Can't sleep?

27:02.411 --> 27:04.379
The men are so young...

27:04.480 --> 27:07.381
...and they sent me a new
crop even greener.

27:08.417 --> 27:10.385
And when l look at them...

27:10.486 --> 27:12.386
l see our boys.

27:14.423 --> 27:16.391
Then you're just the man
to lead them.

27:20.429 --> 27:22.397
l guess.

27:35.444 --> 27:38.413
We intend to convince
the Communist...

27:38.514 --> 27:41.415
...that we cannot be
defeated...

27:41.517 --> 27:43.417
...by force of arms.

27:44.453 --> 27:47.422
l have asked the
Commanding General...

27:47.523 --> 27:49.423
...General Westmoreland...

27:50.459 --> 27:52.427
...what more he needs...

27:52.528 --> 27:55.429
...to meet this mounting
aggression.

27:56.465 --> 27:58.433
He has told me.

27:59.468 --> 28:02.369
And we will meet his needs.

28:04.406 --> 28:07.375
l have today ordered to Vietnam
the Air Mobile Division.

28:07.476 --> 28:10.377
And certain other forces
which will raise...

28:10.479 --> 28:12.276
...our fighting strength
from 75,000 to...

28:12.448 --> 28:15.212
..1 25,000 men...

28:15.317 --> 28:17.217
...almost immediately.

28:17.319 --> 28:20.379
Additional forces will be
needed later...

28:22.424 --> 28:25.393
Get out your best dresses,
ladies.

28:26.428 --> 28:28.396
They will want to celebrate.

28:40.442 --> 28:42.410
Don't you ever...

28:42.511 --> 28:44.411
...be scared.

28:44.513 --> 28:46.413
Lean on me...

28:51.453 --> 28:54.422
l didn't hear the President
Mention a State of Emergency.

28:54.523 --> 28:55.421
No, he didn't.

28:55.524 --> 28:58.425
Well, without that declaration,
it means our enlistments...

28:58.527 --> 28:59.425
...will not be extended.

29:00.462 --> 29:01.360
l'm sorry, Hal.

29:02.398 --> 29:05.367
Forgive me, Sir, but let me
get this straight.

29:05.467 --> 29:07.367
We form a division using
techniques that...

29:07.469 --> 29:09.369
...have never been attempted
in battle...

29:09.471 --> 29:11.371
...against an enemy with 20
years of combat...

29:11.473 --> 29:13.373
...experience on his ground...

29:13.475 --> 29:16.376
...1 2,000 miles away from
our ground.

29:16.478 --> 29:19.379
And right before the Army
sends us into the fight...

29:19.481 --> 29:21.881
...they take away a third
of my men.

29:21.984 --> 29:24.384
The most experienced third,
including the officers.

29:24.486 --> 29:26.386
l don't like it any better
than you do, Hal.

29:26.488 --> 29:27.386
Hell, no!

29:28.424 --> 29:31.393
You saw this coming,
didn't you...? Yes.

29:31.493 --> 29:34.394
That's why you gave me that
new crop of platoon leaders.

29:36.432 --> 29:38.400
Korea didn't teach
them anything.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.400
-Politicians?
-Politicians...

29:46.442 --> 29:47.409
Hold me.

29:48.444 --> 29:49.411
Hold me.

29:50.446 --> 29:52.414
Never let me go...

29:52.514 --> 29:54.414
...until you told me...

29:54.516 --> 29:56.416
...told me...

29:56.518 --> 29:58.418
...what l want to know...

29:58.520 --> 30:01.421
...and then just hold me.

30:01.523 --> 30:03.423
Hold me...

30:03.525 --> 30:07.427
Make me tell you
l'm in love with you...

30:13.469 --> 30:14.436
Thrill me.

30:15.471 --> 30:16.438
Thrill me.

30:17.473 --> 30:18.440
Thank you, Sir.

30:19.475 --> 30:21.534
By the way, Hal, since
we're being deployed...

30:21.643 --> 30:23.440
...they're renumbering
the units.

30:23.545 --> 30:25.445
You're now the
Commanding Officer...

30:25.547 --> 30:27.447
...of the 1 st Battalion
of the 7th Cavalry.

30:31.487 --> 30:32.454
The 7th?

30:33.489 --> 30:35.252
The same regiment
as Custer.

30:39.495 --> 30:40.462
Thank you, Sir.

30:41.497 --> 30:45.456
They told me: ''be sensible
with your love''.

30:45.567 --> 30:48.468
Don't be fooled...

30:48.570 --> 30:51.471
...they missed the last
you've find.

30:52.508 --> 30:57.468
But they never suited
after you...

30:57.579 --> 31:01.413
...when you take me in
your arms...

31:01.517 --> 31:05.419
...and l'll go slowly out of
my mind.

31:06.455 --> 31:08.423
Kiss me... kiss me.

31:09.458 --> 31:11.426
And when you do l'll know...

31:11.527 --> 31:14.428
...that you will miss me.

31:14.530 --> 31:15.428
Miss me.

31:16.465 --> 31:19.434
Did we ever say...

31:19.535 --> 31:21.435
...l've been so kiss me.

31:21.537 --> 31:22.435
Kiss me.

31:23.472 --> 31:25.440
Let me tell you...

31:25.541 --> 31:27.441
...l'm in love with you.

31:33.482 --> 31:34.449
Kiss me.

31:35.484 --> 31:37.452
Kiss me.
And when you do l'll know...

31:37.553 --> 31:39.453
...that you will miss me...

32:49.491 --> 32:51.459
Look around you.

32:53.495 --> 32:55.463
ln the 7th Cavalry...

32:56.498 --> 32:58.466
...we've got a Captain from
the Ukraine...

33:00.502 --> 33:02.402
...another from Puerto Rico...

33:03.438 --> 33:06.407
...we got Japanese,
Chinese, Blacks...

33:06.508 --> 33:08.408
...Hispanics, Cherokee lndians...

33:10.445 --> 33:12.413
...Jews and Gentiles...

33:13.448 --> 33:15.416
...all Americans.

33:16.451 --> 33:18.419
Now here in the States...

33:18.520 --> 33:20.420
Some men...

33:20.522 --> 33:22.422
...in this unit...

33:22.524 --> 33:25.425
...may experience discrimination
because of race or creed.

33:26.461 --> 33:28.429
But for you and me now...

33:29.464 --> 33:31.432
...all that is gone.

33:32.467 --> 33:34.435
We're moving into
the Valley...

33:34.536 --> 33:36.436
...of the Shadow of Death.

33:37.472 --> 33:39.838
Where you will watch
the back...

33:39.942 --> 33:41.034
...of the man next to you...

33:41.143 --> 33:42.440
...as he will watch yours.

33:43.478 --> 33:45.446
And you won't care
what color he is...

33:46.481 --> 33:49.450
...or by what name
he calls God.

33:50.485 --> 33:52.453
They say we're leaving home.

33:55.490 --> 33:57.458
We're going to what home...

33:57.559 --> 33:59.459
Was always supposed to be.

34:01.430 --> 34:04.399
So let us understand
the situation.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.402
We are going into battle...

34:08.437 --> 34:11.406
...against a tough and
determined enemy.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.411
l can't promise you...

34:18.447 --> 34:21.416
...that l will bring you
all home alive.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.420
But this l swear...

34:26.455 --> 34:29.424
...before you and before
almighty God...

34:29.524 --> 34:32.425
...that when we go
into battle...

34:33.462 --> 34:36.431
...l will be the first to set
foot on the field...

34:37.466 --> 34:40.435
...and l will be the last to
step off...

34:42.471 --> 34:45.440
...and l will leave no one
behind.

34:50.478 --> 34:52.447
Dead or alive...

34:54.483 --> 34:57.452
...we will all come home
together...

34:59.488 --> 35:01.388
...so help me God.

38:28.430 --> 38:29.397
l love you.

41:28.376 --> 41:30.344
-Hal.
-Sir.

41:30.445 --> 41:33.346
Last night the enemy hit
our camp at Plaei Me.

41:33.448 --> 41:35.348
-How many casualties?
-None.

41:35.450 --> 41:37.816
The enemy forces withdrew
from this mountain near...

41:37.919 --> 41:38.817
...the Cambodian border.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.354
How many men do you have
battle-ready, give or take?

41:41.456 --> 41:43.356
-Sergeant Major?
-395, Sir.

41:43.458 --> 41:44.356
Exactly.

41:45.393 --> 41:48.362
What do you estimate
the enemy strength?

41:48.463 --> 41:50.658
We appraise their numbers
as manageable, Colonel.

41:51.399 --> 41:53.367
You have no idea.

41:53.468 --> 41:55.368
We have no idea.

41:55.470 --> 41:57.370
Simple orders, Hal.

41:57.472 --> 41:59.372
Find the enemy and kill him.

42:02.410 --> 42:04.378
They attack us...
no casualties.

42:04.479 --> 42:07.380
Then they run and hide
in the mountains.

42:07.482 --> 42:09.382
Naturally we chase
them of course.

42:10.418 --> 42:12.386
Does it smell like an
ambush to you?

42:12.487 --> 42:14.387
They get close
enough to kill us...

42:14.489 --> 42:17.390
...we'll be close enough
to kill them.

42:20.428 --> 42:23.397
Round trip per chopper,
30 minutes.

42:23.498 --> 42:25.398
That means the first 60 men...

42:25.500 --> 42:27.627
...on the ground will be
there a half hour alone.

42:28.369 --> 42:29.336
Son-of-a-bitch.

42:30.371 --> 42:33.033
l think maybe you ought
to get yourself an M-1 6.

42:34.375 --> 42:37.401
When time comes l need one,
they'll be plenty of them lying...

42:37.512 --> 42:38.342
...on the ground.

42:44.385 --> 42:47.354
Let's go do what
we came here to do.

42:47.455 --> 42:48.353
Yes, Sir.

43:02.403 --> 43:03.370
Carry on!

44:13.408 --> 44:15.376
lt was a Sunday,

44:15.476 --> 44:17.376
November 1 4th...

44:17.478 --> 44:18.376
...1 965.

44:19.414 --> 44:22.383
Before that day, the soldiers
of North Vietnam...

44:22.483 --> 44:24.383
...and those of America...

44:24.485 --> 44:27.318
...never met each other
in a major battle.

44:56.384 --> 44:58.750
Two miles out.
Dropping to nap of the earth.

45:50.371 --> 45:54.330
The helicopter soldiers
are coming!

48:01.369 --> 48:03.337
First Platoon. Let's move.

48:22.390 --> 48:25.359
lt's a scout!
Let's take him prisoner!

48:27.328 --> 48:28.295
Lieutenant!

48:29.130 --> 48:30.495
There he goes!
Come on!

48:39.340 --> 48:40.307
Come on!

48:41.342 --> 48:44.311
Captain, l want you to keep
contact with all patrols.

48:47.348 --> 48:49.316
Hey... l got something here!
l got a boy!

48:49.417 --> 48:51.317
Well, hell, that ain't no boy!

48:57.358 --> 49:00.327
-He say he deserter.
-Bullshit, he's a lookout.

49:00.428 --> 49:03.329
Ask him where his friends are.

49:08.369 --> 49:11.338
Hey say this is base camp
for whole division.

49:11.439 --> 49:13.339
-4,000 men.
-Where?

49:19.380 --> 49:21.348
That mountain...

49:29.323 --> 49:31.791
Same army that
destroyed French.

49:31.893 --> 49:34.293
He say they want to kill
Americans very badly.

49:34.395 --> 49:36.022
Just not been able
to find any yet.

49:36.130 --> 49:37.290
Captain Metsker...

49:37.398 --> 49:40.299
...tell all the patrols
to hold their positions.

49:48.342 --> 49:50.310
You, take the radio!

49:54.348 --> 49:57.317
-Sir...
-We got to get that guy!

50:02.356 --> 50:05.325
Captain, you call in all
the patrols.

50:05.426 --> 50:07.326
We have to regroup and
engage the enemy...

50:07.428 --> 50:09.328
...all the way from the LZ...

50:11.365 --> 50:13.333
Net call. Net call.
This is Trojan-Two...

50:13.434 --> 50:16.335
Grab the wounded!
Fall back!

50:19.373 --> 50:21.341
Fall back!
Get the high ground!

50:34.322 --> 50:36.290
Get the high ground!
Get off there!

50:36.390 --> 50:38.290
Take the wounded out of ammo!

50:38.392 --> 50:40.292
Hold the fire!

50:44.332 --> 50:46.300
Everybody down!
Down!

50:49.337 --> 50:52.306
Check your ammo!
Everybody check ammo!

51:00.348 --> 51:02.316
Come on!
l'll get us out of here.

51:03.351 --> 51:05.319
Grab the wounded!
We'll make a run for it!

51:05.419 --> 51:08.320
Sarge? Sarge!
We got to get out of here!

51:09.357 --> 51:12.326
Stay down!
Don't anybody move!

51:12.426 --> 51:14.326
Bungum, stay down!

51:31.379 --> 51:32.346
Stay down!

51:33.381 --> 51:35.349
Form a perimeter!

51:35.449 --> 51:38.350
Conserve your ammo
and stay down!

1 :1 5 P.M.
The Knoll.

51:40.454 --> 51:42.354
What's happening with
that patrol?

51:42.456 --> 51:45.357
l'm trying to reach them, Sir!

51:45.459 --> 51:47.359
Trojan Two... come in! Over!

51:47.461 --> 51:50.362
Hey!
Hey! Calm down!

51:51.399 --> 51:54.368
Understand the situation
and communicate clearly!

51:57.405 --> 52:00.238
Pull the chain on all the
firepower you can get on...

52:00.341 --> 52:01.365
...that mountain!

52:01.475 --> 52:05.377
Alert Crandall,
we have a hot LZ!

52:05.479 --> 52:08.380
Agent Serpent Six,
this is Trojan Two.

52:08.482 --> 52:10.814
You're coming into a hot LZ!
We are taking fire!

52:10.918 --> 52:12.385
Repeat! We are taking fire!

52:13.421 --> 52:14.388
No shit!

52:18.426 --> 52:21.395
Shift immediately to
their flanks.

52:21.495 --> 52:23.395
Do not let them breathe!

52:23.497 --> 52:25.397
Roger that. Trojan-Two out.

52:26.167 --> 52:28.294
Herrick's platoon is cut off
and under attack!

52:28.402 --> 52:29.334
Bravo Company's holding!

52:31.372 --> 52:33.340
They're going to
try to flank us!

52:43.384 --> 52:44.351
Move!

52:45.386 --> 52:47.354
-We got to go!
-We are out of here.

52:51.392 --> 52:52.359
Move!

52:58.399 --> 52:59.366
Savage...

53:02.403 --> 53:04.371
Alright... alright... l got you.

53:06.407 --> 53:07.374
Sir...?

53:08.409 --> 53:11.378
Don't let them get the
signals codes...

53:12.413 --> 53:14.381
Roger that.

53:19.420 --> 53:21.388
l'm glad l could die
for my country.

53:34.368 --> 53:35.335
Doc...

53:52.386 --> 53:53.353
Bungum...

53:55.389 --> 53:56.356
Sarge!

54:02.396 --> 54:04.364
Tell my wife...

54:04.465 --> 54:06.365
...l love her.

54:10.404 --> 54:13.373
This is Savage. l need artillery
at these coordinates...

54:13.474 --> 54:15.374
Niner-3-3-0-1 ...

54:18.412 --> 54:21.381
Ernie! Ernie help!
We got more coming!

54:21.482 --> 54:24.383
We are cutoff!
Copy. We are cutoff.

54:26.420 --> 54:30.322
Landing Zone Falcon
Five miles from X-ray.

54:30.424 --> 54:31.322

54:36.363 --> 54:38.331
We are going to call
a 1 00 more, sir!

54:47.007 --> 54:49.066
They are right on
top of us, sir!

54:49.176 --> 54:50.575
Bringing in it close!

55:00.387 --> 55:03.356
They are using artillery
as a shied!

55:03.457 --> 55:05.357
lt is accurate, and continuous.

55:05.459 --> 55:09.361
We must overrun them now,
when they are at their weakest!

55:09.463 --> 55:11.363
Attack here...

55:12.399 --> 55:14.367
...here, and here!

55:16.403 --> 55:19.372
Overwhelm the landing zone...

55:19.473 --> 55:21.373
...and we have choked
their route...

55:21.475 --> 55:23.375
...of supply and escape!

55:53.374 --> 55:55.342
lt's a hot LZ!

55:55.442 --> 55:57.342
We'll be jumping!
We will not touchdown!

56:10.391 --> 56:12.359
They're trying to break right
through us!

56:12.459 --> 56:14.359
l want you to reinforce
Alpha Company, there!

56:14.461 --> 56:15.359
Yes, Sir!

56:15.462 --> 56:17.362
Now! Move!

56:17.464 --> 56:19.364
Follow me! Charlie Company
up on the ridge!

56:19.466 --> 56:22.367
Doc! The wounded are over
by that termite mound! Go!

56:22.469 --> 56:25.370
Sir, if you don't find some
cover, you're gonna go down!

56:25.472 --> 56:28.305
lf you go down, we all go down!
Come on!

56:43.357 --> 56:44.324
Follow me!

56:45.359 --> 56:47.327
l want the M-1 6 here!

56:55.369 --> 56:56.336

56:59.373 --> 57:02.342
Sir!
Captain Edwards on the ridge!

57:02.443 --> 57:02.841
Bob!

57:02.943 --> 57:05.343
Colonel, these guys
are regulars!

57:05.446 --> 57:08.347
Heavily armed! AK-47's
and pouches of grenades!

57:09.383 --> 57:12.352
Heavy machine guns
and shoulder-fired rockets!

57:14.388 --> 57:16.356
Have we broken through?

57:16.457 --> 57:18.357
The Americans just
landed another...

57:18.459 --> 57:20.359
...wave of reinforcements.

57:21.395 --> 57:24.364
They massed precisely...

57:24.465 --> 57:26.365
...where we attacked

57:26.467 --> 57:28.298
Use the creek bed.

57:30.337 --> 57:32.305
Captain Nadal!

57:32.406 --> 57:34.306
That creed bed is vital!
Vital!

57:35.342 --> 57:38.311
-They'll be coming right at you!
-Do not let them flank!

57:38.412 --> 57:40.312
l repeat, do not
let them flank!

57:40.414 --> 57:42.314
Secure the creek bed!

2:27 P.M.
The Creek Bed

57:59.366 --> 58:02.335
Tom! l want you to keep trying
to raise those Medevac boys!

58:12.379 --> 58:14.347
Tom... Tom?

58:15.382 --> 58:16.349
l'm alright.

58:17.384 --> 58:18.351
Charlie, come here!

58:19.386 --> 58:20.284
l want you to get me all
the air support...

58:21.455 --> 58:23.355
...you can get me on
that mountain! Now!

58:23.457 --> 58:24.355
Now!

58:24.458 --> 58:26.358
Requesting immediate close
air support.

58:26.460 --> 58:29.293
l need you to burn them out
on hilltop.

58:29.396 --> 58:31.296
Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo.

58:32.332 --> 58:34.300
Coordinates: Golf 4-5-2...

58:50.350 --> 58:53.319
Give me something higher up
on that.

58:53.420 --> 58:55.320
Shifting to hilltop, Bravo!

58:55.422 --> 58:57.322
4-5-7-2!

58:59.359 --> 59:02.328
l'll say again: 4-5-7-2!

59:15.375 --> 59:18.344
Medevac Command of the 7th
Cavalry, are you inbound?

59:18.445 --> 59:20.345
Looks pretty hot down there.

59:20.447 --> 59:21.539
lt is a little hot.

59:21.648 --> 59:23.343
Just watch our approach.
Follow us in.

59:23.450 --> 59:26.351
Copy that 7th Cavalry.
We will follow your approach.

59:45.339 --> 59:48.308
Get over there! Reinforce
Charlie Company. There!

59:52.346 --> 59:54.314
You see that?

59:54.414 --> 59:57.315
The Medevac are buggin' out
and leaving the wounded!

01:00:12.366 --> 01:00:14.334
Snake! Get out of here!

01:00:14.434 --> 01:00:17.335
Taking the wounded!
Get the wounded!

01:00:17.437 --> 01:00:19.337
Come on! Come on!

01:00:23.377 --> 01:00:25.345
Okay! Here!

01:00:25.445 --> 01:00:26.810
They're still trying to
flank us!

01:00:26.914 --> 01:00:28.279
Stretch out along the line!

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.287
Radio!

01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:39.755
Trojan Six!
We are in heavy contact!

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.293
ln danger being overrun!

01:00:41.395 --> 01:00:44.296
lf they get into the LZ,
we all had it.

01:00:44.398 --> 01:00:45.422
Can you hold?

01:00:45.532 --> 01:00:48.126
We're spread thin, sir,
but we'll keep them held!

01:00:55.342 --> 01:00:57.310
Crandall. This is Trojan Six.

01:00:57.411 --> 01:01:00.312
lt's too hot down here.
l'm closing the LZ.

01:01:00.414 --> 01:01:03.315
-You copy that, Too Tall?
-Copy that, Snake.

01:01:03.417 --> 01:01:06.318
U.S. lntelligence
Headquarters Saigon

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.321
l don't like it. First time out,
a whole battalion massacred.

01:01:09.423 --> 01:01:12.324
-You think this is a massacre?
-l call losing...

01:01:12.426 --> 01:01:15.327
...a lot of draftees a bad week.
Losing a Colonel is a massacre.

01:01:15.429 --> 01:01:17.329
Moore is still fighting.

01:01:17.431 --> 01:01:19.626
He's under strength against
more men than he can count.

01:01:19.733 --> 01:01:20.825
He's got a whole platoon lost.

01:01:20.934 --> 01:01:23.334
They're not lost. They're only
cut off and surrounded.

01:01:26.373 --> 01:01:28.341
Then they're lost.

01:01:28.442 --> 01:01:30.342
-Sergeant-Major!
-Sir!

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.349
We need to carve out an
emergency LZ right over there!

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.350
-Fine!
-Blow the trees down!

01:01:48.395 --> 01:01:49.362
Fire in the hole!

01:01:56.403 --> 01:01:58.803
Colonel, this is Snakeshit
and Too Tall.

01:01:58.906 --> 01:02:00.931
We're coming in with 2 full
loads of ammo.

01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:02.770
Crandall, we've blown a new LZ.

01:02:02.876 --> 01:02:05.367
When you come in,
come in from the east. Out.

01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.384
Colonel, it's Battalion
headquarters.

01:02:11.485 --> 01:02:12.577
They want you out!

01:02:12.686 --> 01:02:15.382
-We can't get out, damnit!
-Not all of us... just you.

01:02:15.489 --> 01:02:17.389
Saigon wants to debrief you!

01:02:18.425 --> 01:02:20.393
That doesn't make any sense!

01:02:20.494 --> 01:02:22.394
Say again.
Will you repeat that order?

01:02:28.368 --> 01:02:31.337
Too Tall, follow the Colonel
to the new LZ.

01:02:31.438 --> 01:02:33.338
l see him, Snake.

01:02:45.385 --> 01:02:46.352
Shit!

01:02:47.387 --> 01:02:50.356
-We will give you a hand.
-We are moving on board.

01:02:50.457 --> 01:02:53.358
Alright, get the ammo off!
Get the wounded up!

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.360
Come on! Bring them on!
Get them on, boys!

01:02:55.462 --> 01:02:56.360
Come on!

01:03:02.402 --> 01:03:04.370
No! No! We're overloaded!

01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:06.371
No! l'll get out! lt's, Ray!

01:03:06.473 --> 01:03:08.373
He's hurt worse than me!

01:03:09.409 --> 01:03:12.378
You hang on!
l'll see you back there, Ray!

01:03:28.362 --> 01:03:30.330
God! Help me!

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:31.328
God!

01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:40.340
You, me and Ouellette are all
we have in reserve.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.340
Yeah, it's slacking' up a little.

01:03:43.377 --> 01:03:45.345
We just regroup for
another assault.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.348
Distribute that ammo.

01:03:48.448 --> 01:03:50.348
-Ouelette!
-Yes, Sir!

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:53.351
You tell Crandall he's got time
to get one more flight in here.

01:03:53.453 --> 01:03:54.351
Yes, sir.

01:03:55.389 --> 01:03:58.358
Agent Serpent Six,
this is Trojan Six...

01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:01.359
Doc!
Give this water to the wounded.

01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:05.365
Everybody's out of water.
lt must be terrible for them.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.368
And those guys are
cut off up there.

01:04:14.408 --> 01:04:17.377
3:34 P.M. - The Knoll
Running low on ammo, Sarge!

01:04:17.477 --> 01:04:20.378
Pick your target.
One shot, one kill, alright?

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.381
How are we doin', Doc?
We're out of water.

01:04:25.419 --> 01:04:27.319
That's the last of it.

01:04:42.369 --> 01:04:44.337
My face is on fire!

01:04:44.438 --> 01:04:46.338
Foster, hold still!
Hold still!

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.341
l'll cut your face!
Hold still!

01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:05.358
Doc! Doc! Doc!
lt's Foster!

01:05:05.459 --> 01:05:07.359
Okay!

01:05:08.395 --> 01:05:10.363
Does anybody have
anymore bandages?

01:05:26.413 --> 01:05:28.313
Ernie!
Ernie, are you hit too?

01:05:28.415 --> 01:05:31.316
-Are you hit?
-No, no, l'm okay.

01:05:31.418 --> 01:05:34.319
Our guys are going to come
for us, aren't they?

01:05:35.355 --> 01:05:36.322
Yes.

01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:38.324
When?

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.328
Plug his wound.

01:05:45.365 --> 01:05:48.334
That's the main LZ,
but it's closed.

01:06:04.384 --> 01:06:06.352
This is Too Tall. l'm clear.

01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:08.353
Crandall's clear.

01:06:14.394 --> 01:06:16.362
-Geoghegan.
-Colonel.

01:06:16.463 --> 01:06:19.364
l want you to go over there
and reinforce your Company.

01:06:19.466 --> 01:06:22.367
-Yes, sir!
-Okay! Keep your head down!

01:06:24.404 --> 01:06:26.372
To the top of the ridge!
Move it!

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.307
Move! Move!

01:06:40.353 --> 01:06:42.321
Captain Nadal.

01:06:42.422 --> 01:06:44.617
We got to breakthrough
to that cut-off platoon.

01:06:45.358 --> 01:06:48.327
We got an American platoon
out there.

01:06:48.428 --> 01:06:51.329
An Air Cav platoon cut-off
out there!

01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:53.331
Air Cav! Air Cav! Air Cav!

01:07:13.386 --> 01:07:16.355
...l said: l know. Your mom asked
me to give you 600 dollars.

01:07:20.393 --> 01:07:21.360
Hey, good luck to you.

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:29.302
Hey, you got enough room
for one more?

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:33.306
-lf you're crazy enough. Get in.
-Yes, sir.

01:07:49.356 --> 01:07:52.325
Hey! What are those lights
down there?

01:07:52.425 --> 01:07:54.325
Enemy soldiers.

01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:57.330
They use candles on the trail.

01:07:58.365 --> 01:08:00.333
They're moving into
position to attack.

01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:05.338
Here we go!

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:32.298
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:41.307
You and your boys have done
a hell of job today, Snake.

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:44.309
That is the last flight
for tonight, Colonel.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:46.310
But if you need us,
you call us.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:53.319
-Who the hell are you?
-l'm a reporter, Sir.

01:08:54.354 --> 01:08:58.313
Joe Galloway, U.P.l.
How is it going, Colonel?

01:08:58.425 --> 01:09:01.326
We've been flat to the boards
since last night.

01:09:02.362 --> 01:09:03.828
We got more enemy
coming too.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.328
l saw a whole
chain of lights...

01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:07.332
-...coming down the mountain.
-ls that so?

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:10.335
-Yes, sir.
-l can't guarantee your safety.

01:09:10.437 --> 01:09:12.337
Yes, sir, l know

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:15.340
-Where you from, son?
-Refugio, Texas, Sir.

01:09:15.442 --> 01:09:18.569
That's the first thing l've heard
all day that makes any sense.

01:09:19.379 --> 01:09:21.346
-Captain Dillon.
-Sir!

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:24.349
-Did you see those lights.
-l'm on it right now, sir.

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:26.350
You fry them son-of-a-bitches.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:29.286
Risky-Six. This is Trojan-Three.
Fire emissions.

01:09:29.389 --> 01:09:32.290
Angle foxtrot:
four-niner-six-five-six-niner...

01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:41.300
All operations are suspended
for the evening.

01:09:42.335 --> 01:09:45.304
Plane operations are scheduled
for zero-five-thirty hour.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:20.339
-Where is Crandall?
-He's right there, sir.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.341
Crandall.
You led my men into a hot LZ.

01:10:23.443 --> 01:10:25.343
Yes, somebody had to fly out
the wounded.

01:10:25.445 --> 01:10:27.276
No, no, don't you play hotshot
with me!

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.281
You know the rules.
You suckered us in there.

01:10:30.383 --> 01:10:32.851
lf you ever do it again,
l'm going to have you busted!

01:10:32.952 --> 01:10:35.614
You got the balls to face me
but not to face the enemy!

01:10:36.322 --> 01:10:37.289
Get out!

01:10:38.324 --> 01:10:40.292
lf l ever see you again,
l'll kill you.

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:45.297
That's right.

01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:56.308
What a day?

01:11:02.348 --> 01:11:04.316
Tomorrow will be worse.

01:11:07.353 --> 01:11:09.321
lf they make it to tomorrow.

01:11:19.365 --> 01:11:22.334
Ernie, l can't see anything,
but l can smell them.

01:11:23.369 --> 01:11:25.337
Dead bodies stink.

01:11:25.438 --> 01:11:28.339
No, it's not the dead ones. l can
smell them crawling up on us.

01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:30.342
l'm telling you.

01:11:36.382 --> 01:11:38.577
l need illumination...

01:11:38.685 --> 01:11:40.084
...6-5-0...

01:11:40.186 --> 01:11:41.346
...1 -5-0-1 .

01:11:58.404 --> 01:12:01.373
l need artillery on previously
established targets.

01:12:01.474 --> 01:12:04.375
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie.
Fire for effect!

01:12:04.477 --> 01:12:06.377
Fire for effect!

01:12:09.415 --> 01:12:12.384
Save the ammo! Cease fire!

01:12:13.419 --> 01:12:15.387
ls anybody hit?

01:12:16.422 --> 01:12:19.391
Captain, if you guys are coming,
you gotta let us know.

01:12:19.492 --> 01:12:20.686
lt's pitch black out here.

01:12:20.793 --> 01:12:22.818
l don't want to shoot any
of our own guys.

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:25.397
Savage...

01:12:27.367 --> 01:12:30.336
...we can't make it tonight.

01:12:31.371 --> 01:12:33.339
Don't worry, you're going
to make it.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:38.344
We'll come get you in
the morning.

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.347
Yes, sir.

01:12:43.383 --> 01:12:44.350
Out.

01:12:59.399 --> 01:13:01.367
2:23 A.M. - The Ridge

01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:40.339
Pete...
you're doing a...

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.340
...fine job, son.
Don't worry.

01:13:42.442 --> 01:13:45.343
We gave them more than they
gave us today. Keep it up.

01:13:45.445 --> 01:13:48.346
-How're you boys doing?
-Fine, sir.

01:13:48.448 --> 01:13:51.349
Keep it up. Keep doing what
you're doing and you'll be fine.

01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:54.352
Your men have done a hell
of a job today...

01:13:54.454 --> 01:13:57.355
-Lieutenant Geoghegan...
-They won't get through us, sir.

01:13:57.457 --> 01:14:00.358
-You can count on it.
-l know that, Jack.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.358
Keep it up, son.

01:14:04.397 --> 01:14:07.366
-lt's Rear Headquarters, sir.
-How is it out there, Colonel?

01:14:07.467 --> 01:14:10.368
We're surrounded
but we're holding on, Sir.

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:15.374
Sir, l need a confirmed count
of our dead and wounded.

01:14:15.475 --> 01:14:18.376
l got to know where all
my boys are.

01:14:18.478 --> 01:14:20.378
You'll get it, Hal.

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:25.384
-Here they come.
-Captain Edwards.

01:14:27.353 --> 01:14:29.321
l need illumination on
the perimeter.

01:14:29.422 --> 01:14:31.322
Whisky-five.
This is Howard-six-alpha.

01:14:31.424 --> 01:14:33.324
l need illumination. Now.

01:15:09.395 --> 01:15:10.362
Cathy?

01:15:13.399 --> 01:15:14.366
Cathy?

01:15:25.411 --> 01:15:26.378
Cathy.

01:15:28.347 --> 01:15:30.315
A telegram...

01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:33.317
A cab delivers a telegram.

01:15:34.353 --> 01:15:36.321
The Secretary of the Army...
...re...

01:15:38.357 --> 01:15:39.324
...regrets...

01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:39.318
Mrs Moore?

01:16:40.353 --> 01:16:42.321
Colonel Moore's wife?

01:16:44.357 --> 01:16:45.324
Yes.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.329
l need help finding an address.

01:16:50.429 --> 01:16:52.329
-l am looking for...
-You jackass!

01:16:53.366 --> 01:16:55.334
Do you know what this is?

01:16:55.434 --> 01:16:58.335
Do you know what you just
did to me?

01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:13.352
l don't like this job, ma'am.

01:17:14.387 --> 01:17:16.355
l'm just trying to do it.

01:17:20.393 --> 01:17:21.360
Wait.

01:17:22.395 --> 01:17:23.362
Wait.

01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:29.301
l'll take it to her.

01:17:36.209 --> 01:17:38.905
And tell the cab company if
there are any others...

01:17:39.011 --> 01:17:40.308
...just bring them to me.

01:17:51.357 --> 01:17:54.326
Julie...
l just went by to see Catherine.

01:17:54.427 --> 01:17:56.327
Everybody knows.

01:17:57.363 --> 01:18:00.332
No chaplains or counselors.
Cab drivers!

01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:03.334
The Army wasn't ready.

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:06.338
l'll go with you.

01:18:07.373 --> 01:18:09.341
-Thanks.
-Who's it for?

01:18:25.391 --> 01:18:26.358
No!

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.318
l thought she would hate me.

01:18:55.354 --> 01:18:57.322
Your husband didn't start
the war.

01:18:57.423 --> 01:19:00.324
They all knew this could
happen, and so did we.

01:19:22.381 --> 01:19:24.349
l'll take care of these.

01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:26.350
l'll go with you.

01:19:29.322 --> 01:19:30.289
We'll do one at a time.

01:19:31.324 --> 01:19:32.291
Okay?

01:19:33.326 --> 01:19:35.294
We won't look, okay?

01:19:35.394 --> 01:19:36.292
Okay.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.289
Do you think they'll bring more
telegrams tomorrow?

01:20:40.326 --> 01:20:42.294
lf there are, come and get me.

01:21:03.349 --> 01:21:05.340
ln the name of The Father,
The Son and...

01:21:05.451 --> 01:21:06.315
...The Holy Ghost.
Amen.

01:21:08.354 --> 01:21:11.323
Out of the depths
l cry to thee Lord.

01:21:11.424 --> 01:21:13.324
Lord hear my voice.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.727
May thine ears be attentive to
the voice of my supplications.

01:21:19.365 --> 01:21:22.334
...thou, O Lord, shall mark
our inequities.

01:21:23.369 --> 01:21:26.338
Lord, who can abide them?

01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:31.343
With thee there is mercy.

01:21:33.379 --> 01:21:36.348
Grant them eternal
rest, O Lord...

01:21:36.449 --> 01:21:39.350
And make a perpetual light
shine upon them.

01:21:39.452 --> 01:21:42.353
And trough the mercy of God,
may they rest in peace.

01:21:42.455 --> 01:21:45.356
Amen. ln the name
of The Father...

01:21:45.458 --> 01:21:47.358
...The Son and The Holy Ghost.

01:21:53.399 --> 01:21:55.367
You got a death wish, Galloway?

01:21:55.468 --> 01:21:56.366
No, sir.

01:21:57.403 --> 01:21:59.371
Then why are you here?

01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:07.379
Because l knew these
dead boys will be here, sir.

01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:17.389
Why aren't you a soldier?

01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:19.390
You got the guts for it.

01:22:20.426 --> 01:22:22.394
My daddy was a soldier.

01:22:22.495 --> 01:22:25.396
My granddaddy, two of my great
granddaddies were soldiers.

01:22:26.432 --> 01:22:28.332
Hell, that's how l came to be.

01:22:28.434 --> 01:22:31.335
See, each of them lost a leg
in the Civil War.

01:22:31.437 --> 01:22:34.338
My great granddaddy Galloway
he lost his left.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.341
And my great granddaddy Reid
lost his right.

01:22:37.443 --> 01:22:38.341
And...

01:22:39.011 --> 01:22:40.911
...they met in a shoe store
in Galveston...

01:22:41.013 --> 01:22:43.675
...every year after that that,
the same date, the same store...

01:22:43.782 --> 01:22:45.340
...they would get together
and pick out...

01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:47.578
...a brand new pair of shoes
for the two of them.

01:22:48.387 --> 01:22:50.355
You are shitting me.

01:22:50.456 --> 01:22:52.356
No, sir, l swear to God.

01:22:53.392 --> 01:22:56.361
One had a daughter, one had
a son, my grandparents.

01:22:57.396 --> 01:22:59.762
What the hell do you suppose
the odds of them...

01:22:59.865 --> 01:23:01.355
...having the same
shoe size was?

01:23:02.401 --> 01:23:05.370
l don't know, Colonel.
lt was meant to be, l guess.

01:23:08.407 --> 01:23:10.375
Meant to be.

01:23:12.411 --> 01:23:14.072
Sir, Galloways have been in
every war...

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.374
...this country has ever fought.

01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:19.380
But when it came to this one l
didn't think l could stop the war.

01:23:19.485 --> 01:23:20.383
You know, l...

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.389
...just thought that maybe.
l might try and understand one.

01:23:25.424 --> 01:23:28.325
And maybe help folks
back home understand.

01:23:30.362 --> 01:23:33.331
l just figured
l could do that better...

01:23:33.432 --> 01:23:36.333
...shooting a camera than
l could shooting a rifle.

01:23:39.371 --> 01:23:40.338
Well...

01:23:43.375 --> 01:23:45.343
l sure hope you make it
through this one.

01:23:45.444 --> 01:23:47.344
You too, Colonel.

01:23:56.388 --> 01:24:00.347
We fought well today.

01:24:12.404 --> 01:24:15.373
We tested their tactics...

01:24:15.474 --> 01:24:17.374
...and learned their
capabilities.

01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:21.379
Their artillery is effective...

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.381
...so we must get so close...

01:24:24.483 --> 01:24:28.317
...they can't use it.

01:24:29.355 --> 01:24:36.318
We will grab them by the
belt buckle.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.328
Right twenty!

01:25:59.378 --> 01:26:01.346
Put it right on them!

01:26:51.363 --> 01:26:54.332
For the courage of those
who have died...

01:26:55.367 --> 01:26:57.335
For those who are
about to die...

01:26:57.436 --> 01:27:00.337
l am grateful.

01:27:02.374 --> 01:27:02.999
6:09 A.M.
The Creed Bed

01:27:17.389 --> 01:27:19.357
Colonel, sir.

01:27:21.393 --> 01:27:23.361
-Nadal.
-Sir.

01:27:29.334 --> 01:27:31.302
-What is it, sir?
-Nothing's wrong.

01:27:31.403 --> 01:27:33.303
Except there's nothing wrong.

01:27:39.344 --> 01:27:42.313
You just get back to the termite
mound. You'll be fine. Go on!

01:27:42.414 --> 01:27:44.314
Roger that, sir.

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:47.318
Pass the word on. Every man...

01:27:47.419 --> 01:27:50.320
...fire 3 rounds at anything looks
suspicious to them.

01:27:50.422 --> 01:27:52.322
On my signal.

01:28:14.379 --> 01:28:17.348
They're gonna hit us like this
on the whole perimeter.

01:28:17.449 --> 01:28:19.349
We gotta get back to
termite mound.

01:28:19.451 --> 01:28:21.351
Stay here till it stops.

01:28:35.334 --> 01:28:37.302
Sir!... Sir!

01:28:37.402 --> 01:28:39.302
Captain Edwards.
Charlie Company...

01:28:39.404 --> 01:28:41.304
-...on the ridge.
-Bob?

01:28:41.406 --> 01:28:44.307
They're inside the artillery!
l need...

01:28:45.344 --> 01:28:46.311
Bob?

01:28:47.346 --> 01:28:48.313
Bob?

01:28:50.349 --> 01:28:52.317
7:1 5 A.M. - The Ridge

01:29:12.371 --> 01:29:14.339
Godboldt! l need a grenade!

01:29:25.384 --> 01:29:27.284
Go men! Come on! Let's go!

01:29:34.326 --> 01:29:36.294
Godboldt's down!

01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:40.298
l'll get him!

01:30:05.357 --> 01:30:08.326
Captain Dillon, l want you to get
Bravo Company to send up...

01:30:08.427 --> 01:30:11.328
...a platoon across the LZ
support Charlie Company!

01:30:12.364 --> 01:30:15.333
Bravo-six. This is Trojan three.
Bravo-six. This is Trojan three...

01:30:15.434 --> 01:30:18.335
And tell Charlie Company
to get real small in their holes!

01:30:18.437 --> 01:30:20.962
l'm going to drop some artillery
right on top of them!

01:30:21.073 --> 01:30:23.974
Charlie Company. We've rounds
coming right into your position.

01:30:24.376 --> 01:30:26.344
We're being overrun!

01:30:26.445 --> 01:30:29.278
Now, boys, we're going to win
this fight.

01:31:16.361 --> 01:31:17.953
They have brought a
main course...

01:31:18.063 --> 01:31:19.325
...VC battalion against us too.

01:31:20.365 --> 01:31:22.333
l'm requesting that...

01:31:22.434 --> 01:31:24.800
...you dispatch another company
of reinforcements...

01:31:24.903 --> 01:31:27.337
...for movement as soon as
it can be accomplished.

01:31:27.439 --> 01:31:29.339
How bad is it, Hal?

01:31:34.379 --> 01:31:36.347
lt's getting pretty sporty
down here, sir.

01:31:39.384 --> 01:31:41.352
Get out of the way!

01:31:50.395 --> 01:31:53.364
Medic! Get a medic over here!

01:31:57.402 --> 01:31:59.370
Hey, what's your name, soldier?

01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:01.371
Jimmy Nakayama!

01:32:01.473 --> 01:32:03.373
l got a baby being born today!

01:32:03.475 --> 01:32:05.375
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

01:32:10.415 --> 01:32:11.382
Medic!

01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:19.390
You can't take no pictures
lying down there, sonny.

01:32:22.427 --> 01:32:23.394
Down. Right there.

01:32:28.366 --> 01:32:30.334
Sir, l'm a non-combatant, sir.

01:32:30.435 --> 01:32:32.335
Ain't no such thing today, boy.

01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:38.342
Shit!

01:32:41.379 --> 01:32:43.006
Why aren't those
mortars firing?

01:32:43.115 --> 01:32:44.343
What's the problem here?

01:32:44.449 --> 01:32:46.349
These tubes are red hot, sir!
l'm afraid we're going to cook...

01:32:46.451 --> 01:32:48.351
...a round off and blow us all up!

01:32:48.453 --> 01:32:51.354
And we can't cool them off
cause we're all out of water!

01:32:58.396 --> 01:33:00.364
Come on... what are you
waiting for?

01:33:29.361 --> 01:33:30.328
Gentlemen...

01:33:31.363 --> 01:33:33.331
...prepare to defend yourselves.

01:33:47.379 --> 01:33:49.347
We are through their lines
on all sides.

01:34:29.354 --> 01:34:32.323
Congratulations, Colonel.
You have beaten the Americans.

01:34:32.424 --> 01:34:35.325
Negative. Negative. Stand by.

01:34:35.427 --> 01:34:37.327
Any pilots do not see
the enemy.

01:34:37.429 --> 01:34:39.329
They do no pick out
our friendlies.

01:34:39.431 --> 01:34:41.331
Bravo-six, say again,
do you read?

01:34:41.433 --> 01:34:44.334
You got to tell your Company
Commander to pop smoke now.

01:34:44.436 --> 01:34:47.337
They need to mark the lines,
right now!

01:34:47.439 --> 01:34:49.339
He has no lines!

01:34:49.441 --> 01:34:51.807
Stand by.
We cannot see the target.

01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:53.468
Our perimeter is collapsing.

01:34:53.578 --> 01:34:55.341
Half of Company Bravo
is coming down.

01:34:55.447 --> 01:34:57.347
Charlie Company is being
overrun!

01:35:19.404 --> 01:35:20.371
Hastings!

01:35:26.411 --> 01:35:28.311
Broken Arrow!

01:35:30.348 --> 01:35:32.316
Broken Arrow!

01:35:32.417 --> 01:35:35.318
l say it again!
Broken Arrow!

01:35:36.354 --> 01:35:38.322
Broken Arrow!

01:35:38.423 --> 01:35:41.324
-Confirm, Broken Arrow.
-Broken Arrow. Confirmed.

01:35:41.426 --> 01:35:44.020
-Broken Arrow?
-That means an American unit...

01:35:44.129 --> 01:35:45.118
...is being overrun.

01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:47.323
lt calls in every combat
aircraft for support.

01:35:47.432 --> 01:35:50.333
My God, there's not
hiding it now.

01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:15.359
Charlie Company! Report!

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.360
Bravo Company! Report!

01:36:17.462 --> 01:36:20.363
Planes are on
their way, Colonel!

01:36:21.399 --> 01:36:22.366
Sir!

01:36:27.339 --> 01:36:28.306
Roger that.

01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:42.320
We have planes stacked up
at every 1 ,000 feet...

01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.320
...from 7,000 to 35,000!

01:36:44.422 --> 01:36:46.322
We'll get them, sir!

01:36:46.424 --> 01:36:49.325
Advancing coords to our
position. Right?

01:36:49.427 --> 01:36:50.325
One-five-zero...

01:37:09.381 --> 01:37:11.349
Nine-six-two-five-zero-seven...

01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:21.359
You are getting closer in on
zero-five-zero degrees.

01:37:21.459 --> 01:37:23.359
Repeat, zero-five-zero...

01:37:23.461 --> 01:37:25.361
That's, zero-five-zero...

01:37:31.336 --> 01:37:32.303
Goddamnit.

01:37:44.349 --> 01:37:46.317
Company of enemy out in
the open...

01:37:46.418 --> 01:37:49.319
...is facing north on
our position.

01:37:49.421 --> 01:37:50.319
0-5-0 grados.

01:37:51.356 --> 01:37:52.323
at 1-5-0.

01:37:53.358 --> 01:37:58.318
We're getting closer in on
3-1-5 degrees al 0-5-0...

01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:00.330
Charlie!
Call that son-of-a-bitch off!

01:38:01.366 --> 01:38:03.334
Abort! Pull up!

01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:07.338
Get down!

01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:33.297
Charlie!

01:38:34.332 --> 01:38:37.301
Charlie! Listen to me!
You're keeping us alive now.

01:38:37.402 --> 01:38:39.302
You forget about that one!

01:38:39.404 --> 01:38:41.770
And you keep them coming in!
You're doing well, son.

01:38:44.342 --> 01:38:47.311
Seven-O-Two, attack against
the tree line.

01:38:59.624 --> 01:39:01.592
Medic! Medic!

01:39:03.628 --> 01:39:04.595
Medic!

01:39:16.641 --> 01:39:18.609
Oh, God! Jimmy!

01:39:18.710 --> 01:39:20.610
Do you know this guy?

01:39:20.712 --> 01:39:22.612
You know him, talk to him.
Just talk to him!

01:39:22.714 --> 01:39:24.614
Jimmy...
do you hear me?

01:39:24.716 --> 01:39:26.616
lt's Joe. Joe Gallowway.

01:39:27.652 --> 01:39:29.620
We're going to get you
out of here.

01:39:36.661 --> 01:39:39.630
We got to get him to the
landing zone. Grab his legs.

01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:54.578
You got to get
him out of here.

01:39:54.679 --> 01:39:57.580
l can't help you!
You got to do it by yourself!

01:39:57.682 --> 01:40:00.583
-Get him on that chopper! Okay?
-Yes, sir.

01:40:59.611 --> 01:41:01.579
Tell my wife l love her...

01:41:02.614 --> 01:41:04.582
...and my baby.

01:41:04.682 --> 01:41:06.582
You tell them...

01:42:32.637 --> 01:42:34.605
-Captain Nadal.
-Sir.

01:42:34.706 --> 01:42:37.470
Now we put them back
in our heels. We got us a lull.

01:42:37.575 --> 01:42:40.135
l want you to attack... l want you
to go in there and...

01:42:40.244 --> 01:42:41.609
...rescue that cutoff platoon.

01:42:41.713 --> 01:42:44.614
Yes, sir.
First Squad! Move out!

01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:53.557
Add fifty.

01:42:54.592 --> 01:42:58.551
Keep moving the artillery
forward!

01:42:59.597 --> 01:43:00.564
Move it!

01:43:09.607 --> 01:43:11.575
Keep moving forward!

01:43:27.625 --> 01:43:30.594
Sergeant Savage...
you guys still here?

01:43:48.579 --> 01:43:51.548
We have 40 K.l.A., we have
2 M.l.A...

01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:53.549
...these are the last numbers...

01:44:23.614 --> 01:44:26.583
That's a nice day,
Sergeant Savage.

01:44:34.625 --> 01:44:37.594
40 dead. And 2 unaccounted
for, sir.

01:44:37.695 --> 01:44:38.593
Right.

01:44:40.631 --> 01:44:43.600
All right, boys, let's get
them up! Get them out!

01:44:51.576 --> 01:44:54.545
Let's get them out of here!
Get them on the chopper!

01:44:57.582 --> 01:45:00.551
Alright, since most of the men
being loaded on...

01:45:00.651 --> 01:45:02.551
...the chopper is
Charlie Company,

01:45:02.653 --> 01:45:05.554
l want you to take their place.
l'll show you where to start.

01:45:05.656 --> 01:45:07.556
Yes, sir. Let's go.

01:46:05.583 --> 01:46:08.211
Captain, you have your men dig
in some firing steps.

01:46:08.319 --> 01:46:10.549
When it's over throw
some dirt on those bodies.

01:46:10.655 --> 01:46:11.553
-...
-Right, Sergeant Major.

01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:14.888
lt kind of makes you wish
you had signed up...

01:46:14.992 --> 01:46:15.856
...for the submarines?

01:46:16.594 --> 01:46:19.119
Colonel, Brigade headquarters
wants you lifted out...

01:46:19.230 --> 01:46:20.561
...on the first chopper
at dawn.

01:46:20.665 --> 01:46:22.565
Now, what idiot would keep
ordering that...

01:46:22.667 --> 01:46:24.567
...in the middle of a
goddamn battle?

01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:27.570
General Westmoreland
wants a briefing.

01:46:27.672 --> 01:46:29.572
l am in a fight...

01:46:30.241 --> 01:46:32.573
...and l object to this order
to return to Saigon.

01:46:33.611 --> 01:46:36.580
Now l will not leave my men.
ls that clear? Out.

01:46:45.289 --> 01:46:47.723
There's two of my men
unaccounted for out there...

01:46:47.825 --> 01:46:49.884
...and it's where the worst the
fighting was so...

01:46:49.994 --> 01:46:51.518
...they will be out
there some place.

01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:53.722
Let's go and get them,
what do you say?

01:46:53.831 --> 01:46:55.526
-l'm with you, sir.
-Alright...

01:46:55.633 --> 01:46:56.531
Let's go.

01:48:43.607 --> 01:48:44.574
Julie...

01:48:49.613 --> 01:48:50.580
They...

01:48:51.615 --> 01:48:53.583
...brought another...

01:48:53.684 --> 01:48:56.585
No, God, Julie.
Julie, it's yours...

01:48:56.687 --> 01:48:57.585
No.

01:49:43.667 --> 01:49:45.635
He died.
Keeping my promise.

01:50:17.635 --> 01:50:19.603
Sir, they're ordering us
all out.

01:50:19.703 --> 01:50:20.601
All of us.

01:50:21.639 --> 01:50:23.607
They're going to march
reinforcements in.

01:50:24.642 --> 01:50:27.611
They don't understand a
damn thing, do they?

01:50:27.711 --> 01:50:29.611
Can't get out.

01:50:31.649 --> 01:50:34.618
He's waiting up there in a
cave and that's what he wants.

01:50:34.718 --> 01:50:37.619
The minute he sees live soldiers
hopping on the helicopter...

01:50:37.721 --> 01:50:40.622
...he will be all over us,
and then he'll get wants...

01:50:40.724 --> 01:50:42.624
He'll get his massacre.

01:50:50.601 --> 01:50:53.570
Requesting permission to
rejoin the lines, sir.

01:50:56.607 --> 01:50:58.575
Alright, son.

01:51:02.613 --> 01:51:04.581
Carry on, sir.

01:51:27.638 --> 01:51:29.970
l wonder what was going
through Custard's...

01:51:30.074 --> 01:51:31.336
...mind when he realized...

01:51:31.442 --> 01:51:33.603
...he led his men into a
slaughter.

01:51:34.645 --> 01:51:36.613
Sir, Custer was a pussy.

01:51:38.649 --> 01:51:40.617
You ain't.

01:51:44.655 --> 01:51:45.622
Goddamn...

01:51:50.594 --> 01:51:51.561
Hell...

01:51:55.232 --> 01:51:57.564
Right now they are planning
their final attack.

01:51:57.668 --> 01:51:59.568
One that is going to
finish us off.

01:52:00.604 --> 01:52:02.731
They will nibble at us
all night, then...

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:05.570
...come dawn they will hit us
with everything they got.

01:52:07.611 --> 01:52:10.580
That's what l would do
if l was him.

01:52:15.619 --> 01:52:17.587
Sergeant-Major...

01:52:17.688 --> 01:52:20.589
-...hand out the last ammunition.
-Yes, sir.

01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:28.598
Use the darkness to move
into position...

01:52:28.699 --> 01:52:30.599
...and l will bring up
our reserves.

01:52:31.635 --> 01:52:33.603
We will overwhelm
them at dawn...

01:52:33.704 --> 01:52:35.604
...before they are ready.

01:53:15.612 --> 01:53:16.874
5:57 A.M. The Third Day

01:53:41.638 --> 01:53:43.606
Fix bayonets.

01:58:00.564 --> 01:58:03.533
You were wondering how
Custer felt, sir.

01:58:04.568 --> 01:58:06.536
You ought to ask him.

01:58:13.577 --> 01:58:16.546
The Americans have
broken through our lines.

01:58:16.647 --> 01:58:19.548
We have no soldiers
between them...

01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:21.550
...and our command post.

02:00:25.642 --> 02:00:27.610
Sergeant Savage!

02:00:35.652 --> 02:00:37.882
Checking the dead enemies
for documents...

02:00:37.988 --> 02:00:40.616
...l found this on the guy who
tried to bayonet you.

02:00:40.724 --> 02:00:42.783
Translated some of it,
mostly personal.

02:00:42.893 --> 02:00:45.623
l thought you might want to
have a look at it.

02:01:14.624 --> 02:01:16.592
-Joe!
-Joe!

02:01:17.627 --> 02:01:20.596
-What was that?
-lt's American artillery.

02:01:23.633 --> 02:01:26.602
-Friendly fire.
-How many casualties?

02:01:29.639 --> 02:01:31.607
What the hell happened
to you, Joe?

02:01:36.646 --> 02:01:37.613
Hey, Joe.

02:01:39.649 --> 02:01:42.618
Colonel Moore!
Colonel Moore!

02:01:44.654 --> 02:01:45.621
Colonel!

02:01:47.657 --> 02:01:48.555
Colonel!

02:01:49.192 --> 02:01:51.285
What was the key to your
victory, Colonel?

02:01:51.394 --> 02:01:52.554
Sir, tell us how you feel.

02:01:52.662 --> 02:01:55.028
Do you feel the United States
will be forced to take...

02:01:55.131 --> 02:01:56.894
...the North Vietnamese
more seriously now?

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.560
How do you feel about the
lost of your men, sir?

02:01:59.669 --> 02:02:02.570
Have you notified the
families, sir?

02:03:17.614 --> 02:03:20.583
l'm glad you made it, son.

02:03:20.684 --> 02:03:22.584
Thank you, sir.

02:03:22.686 --> 02:03:23.584
You too.

02:03:27.624 --> 02:03:29.592
l'll never forgive myself.

02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:34.597
For what, sir?

02:03:38.635 --> 02:03:40.603
That my men...

02:03:44.641 --> 02:03:47.610
...that my men died
and l didn't.

02:04:09.599 --> 02:04:11.567
Sir, l don't...

02:04:11.668 --> 02:04:14.569
l don't know how to tell
this story.

02:04:15.605 --> 02:04:17.573
Well, you got to, Joe.

02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:22.578
You tell the American people
what these men did here.

02:04:27.617 --> 02:04:30.586
You tell how my troopers died.

02:04:36.626 --> 02:04:37.593
Yes, sir.

02:04:42.632 --> 02:04:43.599
Thank you.

02:05:32.615 --> 02:05:35.584
All of our men, living and
dead are off the field, sir.

02:05:35.685 --> 02:05:37.585
Well done, Sergeant-Major.

02:06:42.619 --> 02:06:44.587
Such a tragedy.

02:06:45.622 --> 02:06:47.590
They will think this was
their victory.

02:06:49.559 --> 02:06:51.527
So this will become an...

02:06:51.628 --> 02:06:53.528
...American war.

02:06:54.564 --> 02:06:56.532
And the end will be the same...

02:06:57.567 --> 02:06:59.535
...except for the numbers who...

02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:02.538
...will die before we get there.

02:07:34.604 --> 02:07:37.573
ln Saigon, Hal Moore's
superiors...

02:07:37.674 --> 02:07:40.575
...congratulated him for killing
over 1,800 enemy soldiers.

02:07:41.611 --> 02:07:44.580
Then ordered him to lead the
men of the 7 th Cavalry...

02:07:44.681 --> 02:07:46.581
...back into battle again.

02:07:46.683 --> 02:07:47.581
He led them...

02:07:48.551 --> 02:07:50.519
...and fought beside them...

02:07:51.554 --> 02:07:53.522
...for 235 more days.

02:08:15.578 --> 02:08:17.546
Kids, go to bed.

02:08:17.647 --> 02:08:19.547
lsn't there someone
at the door?

02:08:19.649 --> 02:08:20.547
Go to bed!

02:09:01.624 --> 02:09:03.592
Children!
Your daddy's home!

02:09:03.693 --> 02:09:05.593
-Daddy!
-Daddy!

02:09:10.633 --> 02:09:13.602
Some had families waiting.
For others, their...

02:09:13.703 --> 02:09:16.604
...only family would be the
men they had bled beside.

02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:19.608
There we no bands...

02:09:19.709 --> 02:09:20.607
...no flags...

02:09:21.644 --> 02:09:24.613
...no honor guards to welcome
them home.

02:09:24.714 --> 02:09:27.615
They went to war because their
country ordered them to.

02:09:28.651 --> 02:09:31.916
But in the end they fought not
for their country or their flag.

02:09:32.655 --> 02:09:35.624
They fought for each other.

02:09:38.661 --> 02:09:40.629
Dear Barbara...

02:09:40.730 --> 02:09:43.631
l have no words to express to
you my sadness...

02:09:43.733 --> 02:09:45.633
...over the lost of Jack.

02:09:47.670 --> 02:09:50.571
The world is a lesser
place without him.

02:09:50.673 --> 02:09:53.574
But l know he is with God
and the angels.

02:09:53.676 --> 02:09:56.577
But even heaven has improved
by his presence there.

02:09:58.614 --> 02:10:01.583
l know you too are sure of
this, and yet...

02:10:01.684 --> 02:10:04.585
...this knowledge can't
diminish his lost...

02:10:04.687 --> 02:10:06.587
...and your grief.

02:10:07.623 --> 02:10:09.591
With abiding respect and
affection...

02:10:09.692 --> 02:10:11.592
Hal Moore.

02:10:23.639 --> 02:10:26.608
We who have seen war...

02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:28.609
...we'll never stop seeing it.

02:10:31.647 --> 02:10:34.616
ln the silence of the night we
will always hear the screams.

02:10:39.655 --> 02:10:42.624
So this is our story.

02:10:42.725 --> 02:10:45.626
For we were soldiers once...

02:10:45.728 --> 02:10:47.628
...and young.

02:10:51.601 --> 02:10:54.570
The Names of the men of
the 7 th Cavalry...

02:10:54.670 --> 02:10:57.571
...who died in the la Drang
Valley are remembered on...

02:10:58.608 --> 02:11:01.577
Panel 3-East of the Vietnam
War Memorial.

02:11:01.677 --> 02:11:04.578
To their left and right are the
names of 58,000...

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:06.580
...of their brother-in-arms.

02:11:06.682 --> 02:11:09.583
These are the names of those...

02:11:09.685 --> 02:11:12.586
...who died at LZ X-Ray.
