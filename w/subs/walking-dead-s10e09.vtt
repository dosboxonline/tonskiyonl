42:34.888 --> 42:36.807
from a hundred miles
from here.

42:38.475 --> 42:40.310
We don't want our backs
pressed against this mountain

42:40.394 --> 42:41.520
when they come.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.149
We can't save them
if we're dead.

42:47.651 --> 42:48.652
(SNIFFLES)

42:50.487 --> 42:51.488
Come on.

42:56.910 --> 42:58.871
(CRYING)

43:03.876 --> 43:06.253
CAROL: (VOICE BREAKING)
Go ahead and say it to me.

43:06.336 --> 43:07.337
I deserve it.

43:09.214 --> 43:11.049
Just say it to me.

43:13.177 --> 43:14.553
You were right
about everything.

43:14.636 --> 43:16.221
Just say it.

43:16.305 --> 43:18.223
No, please.

43:19.516 --> 43:21.268
You cared about her.

43:21.351 --> 43:22.978
And now she's gone
because of me.

43:23.061 --> 43:24.813
Please,
just say it!

43:26.773 --> 43:28.942
Please say it!

43:31.320 --> 43:32.946
(CRYING)

43:34.781 --> 43:36.408
Go home.

43:36.491 --> 43:38.911
Tell the others
we found the horde.

43:38.994 --> 43:40.621
Where you gonna be?

43:40.704 --> 43:42.039
They got out before us.

43:43.665 --> 43:45.334
There's gotta be
another way in.

44:01.016 --> 44:02.184
CAROL: No.
