00:17.875 --> 00:21.207
So this is...

00:21.208 --> 00:22.666
[The Eminence] Everything.

00:23.375 --> 00:27.582
It's just so much.

00:27.583 --> 00:30.582
How can anyone ever be expected
to take it all in?

00:30.583 --> 00:35.665
Well, not everyone can.
But you are not just anyone.

00:35.666 --> 00:39.000
You are a disciple
of the Order of the Watchers.

00:39.875 --> 00:40.875
Of me.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.832
It's natural
to fear a new beginning, my friend.

00:45.833 --> 00:48.540
We're asked to sacrifice so much.

00:48.541 --> 00:54.000
Our wills, our wants, even our own names
for the powers we are given.

00:55.125 --> 00:59.499
But of everyone I have ever trained,
I have never been more certain

00:59.500 --> 01:02.582
of a disciple's devotion to our mission.

01:02.583 --> 01:05.374
Me? Why?

01:05.375 --> 01:09.791
Well, because I know
you do not fear sacrifice.

01:16.041 --> 01:19.125
But what if you're wrong about me?

01:19.666 --> 01:23.625
[chuckles] Well..."What if"
is an irrelevant question.

01:24.958 --> 01:27.124
Or have you not studied our ways?

01:27.125 --> 01:30.082
- I have.
- And you understand

01:30.083 --> 01:36.082
that to preserve the natural order,
you must only observe the natural order.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.915
Yes, of course.

01:37.916 --> 01:39.415
And are you prepared

01:39.416 --> 01:42.208
to relinquish everything
in your life to do so?

01:42.333 --> 01:44.707
"To watch over everyone,

01:44.708 --> 01:47.000
I must become no one."

01:47.541 --> 01:52.208
Then you are ready,
as I've always known you would be.

01:57.625 --> 01:59.165
[sighs]

01:59.166 --> 02:02.749
I guess I should probably
take that oath then.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.250
You just did.

02:06.458 --> 02:10.583
So, rise. A Watcher.

It's beautiful.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.791
[The Eminence] No, it just is.

02:50.791 --> 02:52.624
You are a Watcher now.

02:52.625 --> 02:55.750
You make no judgments. Only observations.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.249
Then what is the point of just watching?

02:59.250 --> 03:01.165
[chuckling] Well, only with time

03:01.166 --> 03:04.041
can a Watcher begin
to understand that for themselves.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.707
If I am certain of one thing,

03:06.708 --> 03:10.375
it is that
your conclusion will not disappoint.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.500
Thank you.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.041
I will never fail you.

03:17.791 --> 03:19.249
You failed me!

03:19.250 --> 03:20.665
[♪ foreboding music plays]

03:20.666 --> 03:24.416
You came to us
all those eons ago a believer.

03:24.916 --> 03:27.833
But you return a heretic.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.415
You have broken your sacred oath.

03:31.416 --> 03:35.082
And now you must answer for your crimes
against our Order.

03:35.083 --> 03:38.540
Crimes? Everything I've ever done
has been to help people.

03:38.541 --> 03:41.707
To save a Multiverse
whose sanctity I vowed to preserve.

03:41.708 --> 03:45.374
You exposed our secrets to mortal beings.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.665
I shared them with heroes.

03:47.666 --> 03:50.832
Is that what you would call
Stephen Strange?

03:50.833 --> 03:53.832
The sorcerer who destroyed
his entire universe,

03:53.833 --> 03:59.165
and then used the knowledge you gave him
to birth an entirely new one all his own.

03:59.166 --> 04:03.415
He sacrificed his own soul
to resurrect the home he destroyed.

04:03.416 --> 04:05.124
It is unnatural.

04:05.125 --> 04:08.999
It is a miracle that continues
to birth new branches of reality

04:09.000 --> 04:10.957
for us to watch over.

04:10.958 --> 04:12.624
Surely you can see,

04:12.625 --> 04:16.082
for a garden to thrive,
it must be cultivated

04:16.083 --> 04:19.707
so its trees grow higher,
its flowers bloom brighter,

04:19.708 --> 04:22.499
and... and pests that threaten
to destroy it all

04:22.500 --> 04:23.582
are weeded out.

04:23.583 --> 04:27.082
It is a convenient argument,
but one that does not explain

04:27.083 --> 04:29.415
your intervention to save Riri Williams.

04:29.416 --> 04:31.540
That was one time out of trillions.

lies your failure.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.124
Nothing can matter to a Watcher.

05:23.125 --> 05:26.040
For a Watcher is no one.

Do not listen to them. No one is no one.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.124
You showed me that.

05:31.125 --> 05:34.165
I would not expect a heretic
to understand.

05:34.166 --> 05:37.374
Which is why you must die.

- Please. This is not our way.

05:40.208 --> 05:43.790
It wasn't. But now we must break our oaths

15:53.458 --> 15:55.749
- [grunting]
- [energy crackling]

15:55.750 --> 15:57.750
[groans]

16:00.541 --> 16:02.124
Please, I do not want to fight you!

16:02.125 --> 16:04.332
You understand
the power a choice can have.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.541
You've made yours!

16:07.291 --> 16:09.415
[both grunting]

16:09.416 --> 16:11.666
[yelps, groans]

16:48.833 --> 16:52.000
[grunts, groans]

16:58.458 --> 17:00.583
[both grunting]

17:05.166 --> 17:07.625
[explosion]

17:11.875 --> 17:13.291
[groaning softly]

17:21.416 --> 17:23.207
My old friend,
you must stop and see reason.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.041
You betrayed destiny.

17:28.041 --> 17:31.333
All my life, I have summoned
the forces of nature.

17:33.916 --> 17:37.415
But now, I am nature!

17:37.416 --> 17:41.375
- [voice echoing]
- [energy rumbling]

17:43.208 --> 17:45.291
[both gasp]

17:53.208 --> 17:54.832
Please, this does not need to continue.

17:54.833 --> 17:56.000
Then surrender!

17:57.000 --> 18:00.291
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

18:04.541 --> 18:06.790
[grunts]

18:06.791 --> 18:09.040
[groaning]

18:09.041 --> 18:12.749
[both grunting]

18:12.750 --> 18:14.666
[groaning]

18:15.500 --> 18:16.541
Yield!

18:20.750 --> 18:23.791
[groans, yelps]

18:29.500 --> 18:31.874
[groaning]

18:31.875 --> 18:33.166
Yield!

18:34.125 --> 18:35.291
Never!

18:37.666 --> 18:40.458
You have lost. Yield!

18:42.458 --> 18:43.541
[straining] Never.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.083
[groaning]

18:48.875 --> 18:49.916
Never!

18:50.583 --> 18:53.041
[screaming, groaning]

18:58.000 --> 19:00.040
[groaning]

19:00.041 --> 19:01.291
Never!

19:04.208 --> 19:05.208
Wait.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.250
[panting]

19:15.083 --> 19:16.083
Please.

19:17.416 --> 19:19.583
This is not what you taught me.

19:20.916 --> 19:22.708
[panting]

19:23.875 --> 19:26.416
I did not teach you everything.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.291
Uatu, what are they doing?

19:38.125 --> 19:40.916
[The Eminence] Behold, your end.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.416
[both groaning]

19:51.000 --> 19:53.208
[The Eminence]
You will not just die here.

19:54.125 --> 20:00.416
Every version of yourself
will be erased from every universe.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.665
Along with everything you've ever done.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.124
No!

20:08.125 --> 20:10.625
[The Eminence]
And every life you've ever touched.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.124
You will have never existed.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.124
[crying] No!

20:18.125 --> 20:19.457
[The Eminence] It's over.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.916
You cannot fight this.

20:25.375 --> 20:28.041
[groaning]

20:29.333 --> 20:32.291
[energy rumbling]

20:54.875 --> 20:56.500
[groaning]

21:00.083 --> 21:01.083
No!

21:02.750 --> 21:05.416
[grunting]

21:09.708 --> 21:11.916
[gasps]

21:14.333 --> 21:16.665
- [grunting]
- [energy whooshing]

21:16.666 --> 21:18.915
Peggy, what are you doing?

21:18.916 --> 21:21.625
I am not losing any friends today!

21:23.708 --> 21:24.916
No!

21:26.625 --> 21:29.125
[screaming]

21:41.291 --> 21:43.916
[explosion]

21:49.875 --> 21:53.833
[♪ triumphant instrumental music playing]

22:09.500 --> 22:11.333
[groaning softly]

22:12.083 --> 22:13.250
You're not...

22:14.000 --> 22:17.458
[both groaning]

22:19.916 --> 22:21.083
You're alive.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.915
We're alive.

22:23.916 --> 22:25.875
Wait. Peggy.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.666
- Peggy!
- [The Eminence] She's gone.

22:33.166 --> 22:36.375
Her great sacrifice for nothing.

22:38.333 --> 22:43.458
This is where your story
finally ends, Uatu.

22:45.125 --> 22:46.958
[grunts]

22:48.625 --> 22:52.000
[grunting]

22:52.916 --> 22:55.332
What? Why aren't my powers working?

22:55.333 --> 22:56.875
[Uatu chuckles]

22:57.500 --> 23:00.500
Because you're in his world now.

23:07.083 --> 23:09.041
Stephen Strange is...

23:09.833 --> 23:11.624
[Uatu] A living universe.

23:11.625 --> 23:15.375
And in here, he has absolute power.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.833
You have none.

23:18.916 --> 23:19.916
How--

23:20.791 --> 23:22.124
I don't know...

23:22.125 --> 23:23.749
How did I not see this coming?

23:23.750 --> 23:27.624
When you spend so many eons
looking down on everything,

23:27.625 --> 23:32.083
it becomes hard to imagine something
you've never seen before.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.999
And how did you learn?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.707
The people I watched over showed me.

23:37.708 --> 23:41.457
You can find lessons
in every corner of the Multiverse,

23:41.458 --> 23:43.500
if you open your eyes.

23:45.083 --> 23:49.166
I suppose if you brought me here,
you mean to kill me.

23:51.166 --> 23:52.791
That is not our way.

23:54.583 --> 23:57.875
You still believe that?
After everything I've put you through?

23:59.791 --> 24:05.249
You once told me, "Every Watcher must come
to understand our mission for themselves."

24:05.250 --> 24:09.707
I only hope that I might be able to share
what I have learned.

24:09.708 --> 24:10.916
With me?

24:11.583 --> 24:13.375
You've taught me so much.

24:14.208 --> 24:16.708
I owe it to you to return the favor.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.375
[panting]

24:33.000 --> 24:34.125
[Storm] Peggy did it.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.374
She got us here.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.791
Of course she did.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.666
It's beautiful, isn't it?

24:46.291 --> 24:48.874
It is a sunrise.

24:48.875 --> 24:53.291
What something is,
is not the same as what it means.

24:56.375 --> 25:01.000
But to understand that, you will
need to do more than simply watch.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.541
You must learn to see.

25:06.666 --> 25:09.541
[♪ pleasant music playing]

25:13.833 --> 25:17.125
Perhaps here, you can begin.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.625
[♪ pleasant music continues playing]

25:45.708 --> 25:47.041
[Kahhori] The winds blow...

25:48.916 --> 25:50.083
the birds sing...

25:51.416 --> 25:52.708
the water flows...

25:54.625 --> 25:57.750
and our eldest brother, the sun, rises,

26:04.708 --> 26:07.000
I only wish she could be here with us.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.500
I miss her.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.041
[Uatu] Perhaps she is.

26:13.333 --> 26:17.166
Someone somewhere is always watching.

26:18.208 --> 26:23.000
And ever since her sacrifice,
for the first time in all time,

26:24.291 --> 26:29.375
it feels like someone is watching over me.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.625
[♪ poignant music playing]

26:48.583 --> 26:51.750
[Kahhori] My people believe that in death,

26:52.916 --> 26:55.708
we move on to an even greater adventure.

26:59.500 --> 27:05.040
Uatu, do you know if there truly
is a road after this one?

27:05.041 --> 27:07.250
Beyond all we have seen?

27:12.708 --> 27:14.457
[Uatu] With some mysteries,

27:14.458 --> 27:16.666
sometimes the only answer

27:17.291 --> 27:18.791
is another question.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
<i>You see...</i>

27:22.625 --> 27:23.625
<i>Time.</i>

27:25.416 --> 27:26.541
<i>Space.</i>

27:27.958 --> 27:28.958
<i>Reality.</i>

27:30.166 --> 27:32.291
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

27:33.875 --> 27:37.125
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

27:37.833 --> 27:42.707
<i>where a single choice
can branch off into infinite realities,</i>

27:42.708 --> 27:46.875
<i>creating new phenomena
beyond what you could possibly imagine.</i>

27:48.083 --> 27:50.708
<i>I am Uatu.</i>

27:51.833 --> 27:55.708
<i>I see all of these vast new realities.</i>

27:56.458 --> 27:58.082
<i>Open your eyes,</i>

27:58.083 --> 28:02.625
<i>dare to face the unknown
and ponder the question...</i>

28:04.333 --> 28:06.040
<i>"What if?"</i>
