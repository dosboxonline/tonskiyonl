I don't know when the next time
we'll be able to heart-to-heart is,

30:51.143 --> 30:52.227
but I just wanted
to let you know

30:52.311 --> 30:54.771
that the last few days
have been incredible.

-Yes.

31:08.493 --> 31:10.954
I will be there...

Eugene.
You ready or what?

31:25.469 --> 31:28.180
Let's get this
over with.

31:28.263 --> 31:30.766
I got a date.

31:42.486 --> 31:44.029
Hi.

31:46.448 --> 31:48.534
Here we go.

31:52.287 --> 31:53.789
You okay?

31:55.999 --> 31:58.126
No.
I got cancer.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.837
But that's okay.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.213
You know
what I'm sayin'?

32:02.756 --> 32:04.758
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that.

32:07.302 --> 32:10.013
Look, you and I, uh...

32:10.097 --> 32:13.725
we never really had much
to say to each other.

32:13.809 --> 32:15.435
But that doesn't mean
I don't know

32:15.519 --> 32:18.146
all the things
you've been through.

32:18.230 --> 32:20.315
You're stronger
than most,

32:20.399 --> 32:23.026
and there's
a whole lot of people here

32:23.110 --> 32:24.653
real glad about that.

32:26.238 --> 32:27.406
I am, too.

32:29.783 --> 32:30.993
Thanks, man.

32:32.411 --> 32:33.537
That means a lot.

32:34.705 --> 32:38.458
Yeah. Things are gonna get
real bad around here.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.460
I just want to know
that the kids are all right.

32:41.712 --> 32:45.841
If things go sideways,
or you or I go down...

32:45.924 --> 32:47.426
The other
gets the children out.

32:49.386 --> 32:50.846
You good with that?

32:57.227 --> 32:59.062
All right.

33:10.908 --> 33:12.075
Hi.

33:13.243 --> 33:15.913
You should be
with the other kids.

33:15.996 --> 33:17.706
I wanna help.

33:17.789 --> 33:19.124
I can fight.

33:19.208 --> 33:20.792
I know you can.

33:20.876 --> 33:22.753
I'm sorry about today.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.880
You didn't need to see
those bodies like that.

33:24.963 --> 33:26.507
They were just walkers.

33:26.590 --> 33:28.717
I've killed
plenty of walkers.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.093
I know.

33:30.177 --> 33:31.553
But they weren't
just walkers.

33:34.515 --> 33:36.141
I'm not scared.

33:36.225 --> 33:38.060
DARYL: I know you're not.

33:38.143 --> 33:40.437
Maybe I am,
a little bit.

33:44.566 --> 33:46.318
If I was scared,

33:46.401 --> 33:49.738
maybe I'd be scared for RJ
because he's so little.

33:51.073 --> 33:52.115
Yeah.
I get that.

33:52.199 --> 33:54.618
Maybe I'd be worried
about my mom.

33:56.286 --> 33:58.205
Maybe I'd be scared
that you'd get hurt

33:58.288 --> 34:00.958
and I'd lose you.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.460
And Aunt Carol, too.

34:03.544 --> 34:06.505
DARYL:
There ain't no shame in that.

34:06.588 --> 34:08.131
You know
who you're fighting for.

34:14.847 --> 34:17.349
I made you something.

34:17.432 --> 34:19.309
It's for luck.

34:19.393 --> 34:20.561
No way.

34:20.644 --> 34:23.146
I love it.

34:25.232 --> 34:26.400

where I am or not.
