02:02.000 --> 02:03.729
Good evening. Sure is hot, huh ?

02:08.207 --> 02:09.231
I'm back.

02:13.178 --> 02:14.076
Thanks.

02:14.847 --> 02:17.475
Another plastic bag ?
It's just a carton of milk.

02:18.283 --> 02:19.181
But they just give it to you.

02:19.785 --> 02:20.717
You don't have to take it.

02:21.487 --> 02:22.749
Oh, I'd like some, please.

02:23.222 --> 02:24.814
And you, Father
? Some wheat tea ?

02:25.324 --> 02:27.815
Sure. I'll have
some. Be right there.

02:29.328 --> 02:32.092
Thanks. Can I use it ?
I'm printing right now.

02:33.832 --> 02:35.891
Maybe we should buy a portable
word processor after all.

02:38.871 --> 02:42.136
This smoke stinks. You should have
gone to Kashirazaki, too, Shizuku.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.608
It's okay, I can't
keep up with Sis.

02:45.878 --> 02:46.708
Oh yeah

02:47.112 --> 02:49.273
I've gotta go to work
tomorrow. You need a lunch ?

02:49.581 --> 02:50.639
Don't worry, I'll eat out.

02:51.350 --> 02:53.511
Our library's finally
changing to a bar code system.

02:53.886 --> 02:54.910
So things are really busy.

02:55.487 --> 02:58.047
Then you are changing it. I
liked the card catalogs better.

02:59.491 --> 03:01.482
Yeah, I do too. Hey

03:02.094 --> 03:04.221
Something's wrong with this
composition. What? Where ?

03:06.165 --> 03:08.292
Look, here

03:18.911 --> 03:19.878
This name...

03:21.647 --> 03:24.081
Shizuku, books are fine,
but you should go to sleep.

03:24.416 --> 03:25.440
Okay. Good night.

03:34.426 --> 03:36.986
I thought I remembered
seeing this name...

03:40.199 --> 03:41.188
And here, too.

03:49.141 --> 03:52.702
This guy's amazing. He borrowed
all of them before I did.

04:00.385 --> 04:03.548
Amasawa Seiji... What
kind of person is he ?

04:04.122 --> 04:05.680
I wonder if he's cool or not ?

04:23.909 --> 04:27.902
Shizuku, will you get
up ? I'm going out now !

04:30.749 --> 04:31.340
Oh, geez.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.851
You just slept that
way? Get the rice ready !

04:34.853 --> 04:36.115
Have a good day.

04:40.058 --> 04:42.822
What ?! It's that late
?! I have to meet Yuuko !

04:45.530 --> 04:46.690
My wallet !

04:48.166 --> 04:50.828
What ? Did you forget
it again ? Yeah !

04:52.437 --> 04:53.995
That's strange.

04:54.806 --> 04:55.830
Is it next to the phone ?

04:57.409 --> 04:59.570
Here it is ! You're the
one who put it there.

05:00.045 --> 05:02.275
Oh, I'm gonna be late !
Remember to lock up !

05:02.781 --> 05:04.078
What a ditz.

05:08.854 --> 05:14.486
Boy, are they flying low !

05:19.965 --> 05:21.262
Something great's
gonna happen today !

05:46.858 --> 05:48.189
Wow, it's hot.

05:57.035 --> 05:58.866
Yoo-hoo ! How's it goin' ?

06:19.992 --> 06:21.050
C'mon, let's do it !

06:21.994 --> 06:23.928
Hey, Shizuku !

06:24.963 --> 06:27.830
Hey ! Go for it !

06:31.670 --> 06:32.932
Miss Kousaka, are you in ?

06:34.006 --> 06:36.099
Oh, it's you,
Tsukishima. What's up ?

06:36.475 --> 06:38.500
Can I please ask a favor ?

06:39.144 --> 06:41.169
What kind ? I hope
it's nothing strange.

06:41.613 --> 06:43.979
Can you open the library,
please ? The library ?

06:44.683 --> 06:46.412
Can't you wait until
they open normally ?

06:46.952 --> 06:48.010
But I've already
read all my books.

06:48.453 --> 06:50.182
And the county
library's closed today.

06:51.990 --> 06:54.424
I've decided to read twenty
books during vacation.

06:54.726 --> 06:58.253
Twenty books? But you're supposed
to be studying for your exams.

06:59.664 --> 07:00.790
C'mon, hurry it up.

07:01.199 --> 07:03.633
Let's see...Got it !
Hurry and bring it over !

07:06.271 --> 07:09.104
C'mon, c'mon. Get out your
reading card and your library card.

07:09.908 --> 07:11.205
Here you go.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.371
Hey, look at this. No
one's ever checked this out.

07:16.748 --> 07:20.445
This is a rare book. They don't
have it at the county library.

07:28.927 --> 07:30.155
Amasawa...

07:30.896 --> 07:31.624
Teach !

07:32.064 --> 07:33.725
Any idea what this
''Amasawa'' person is like ?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.958
Geez, now I messed up.

07:37.769 --> 07:40.567
Probably the donor of the book. I
wouldn't know about something that old.

07:41.006 --> 07:42.496
Try asking our veteran teachers.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.099
Shizuku !

07:44.743 --> 07:46.677
Oh, geez ! So this
is where you are !

07:47.646 --> 07:49.170
After you said you'd be
at the entrance at eleven !

07:49.781 --> 07:51.305
You made me wait in the
sun for fifteen minutes !

07:51.783 --> 07:53.341
Now I'll get even more freckles !

07:53.752 --> 07:54.548
l...I'm sorry.

07:54.986 --> 07:55.850
Hey, hey ! Not so loud.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.083
You worry too much about
your freckles, Harada.

07:58.523 --> 08:00.991
Teach this is a
serious problem for me !

08:01.359 --> 08:04.920
Oh, right ! Right ! Out, out !

08:10.602 --> 08:11.626
That way, that way !

08:14.406 --> 08:16.374
I did what I could but
it's not that great.

08:17.242 --> 08:18.766
Think I should have
kept it in English ?

08:20.879 --> 08:22.779
''Over the green hills,
white clouds drift so slow.''

08:23.248 --> 08:28.515
''Near to the road that
goes up to the city.'

08:29.287 --> 08:33.986
''lnside the old room
by the small window.''

08:34.192 --> 08:37.389
''The old dog waits for
him to come back soon.'

08:37.696 --> 08:41.826
''Country Road,
take me home, too.''

08:42.267 --> 08:46.067
''On this distant road,
whose end I can't see.''

08:46.538 --> 08:50.531
''West Virginia,
Mountain Mamma.''

08:50.942 --> 08:54.935
''To my home town,
I long to see.''

08:55.847 --> 08:56.541
This isn't bad.

08:57.149 --> 08:59.777
It sucks! Too
conventional. You think so ?

09:03.288 --> 09:04.482
I did this one, too.

09:05.957 --> 09:07.857
''Concrete road,
wherever you go.''

09:08.393 --> 09:13.126
''Forests give rise
to valleys far away.''

09:13.498 --> 09:17.901
'''Western Tokyo,
on Mount Tama.''

09:18.403 --> 09:25.605
''My home lies on
Concrete Road.''

09:26.278 --> 09:28.940
What is this ?

09:29.414 --> 09:30.847
So, what'd you
want to talk about ?

09:31.950 --> 09:34.714
You don't need any
poems translated, right ?

09:35.320 --> 09:38.050
Shizuku, is there
anyone you like ?

09:38.823 --> 09:41.087
I just wish it was
a mutual attraction.

09:41.693 --> 09:44.560
It's exam time, and we could work
together and cheer each other up.

09:45.363 --> 09:47.422
So there's someone
you like, Yuuko ?

09:50.168 --> 09:52.864
You already got a love
letter ?! Not so loud !

09:53.271 --> 09:54.704
When ? How is he ?~~Is he cute ?

09:55.340 --> 09:58.309
He's from a different class...
And he's kind of cute...

09:58.710 --> 10:01.270
Why don't you go out with him ?
You can stop if you don't like him.

10:01.980 --> 10:03.277
Yeah, but...

10:04.749 --> 10:07.775
So there's someone
else you like ?!

10:09.254 --> 10:12.587
There's no use hiding it !
C'mon ! Might as well 'fess up !

10:16.761 --> 10:20.857
Umm... it's Su... Su...

10:21.433 --> 10:22.764
TSUKlSHlMA !

10:23.235 --> 10:26.500
Can you get my bag for me ?!

10:26.805 --> 10:27.134
Sugimura !

10:28.240 --> 10:29.867
Yeah ! Just throw it here !

10:30.575 --> 10:33.703
Oh, shut up ! You don't
even play that well !

10:34.012 --> 10:37.641
That's mean ! I won
three games as a regular !

10:37.882 --> 10:38.541
Yuuko ?

10:50.895 --> 10:53.625
So Sugimura's the one
that you like, huh ?

10:54.266 --> 10:58.100
What should I do ? He might
have found out. I was so...

10:58.436 --> 11:00.563
Oh, don't worry. He's
too stupid to know.

11:01.773 --> 11:03.866
What'll you do about the
love letters you got ?

11:07.979 --> 11:10.413
I have to think a little longer.

11:11.016 --> 11:11.710
I see.

11:12.651 --> 11:13.583
You're lucky.

11:13.952 --> 11:16.352
They don't keep telling you to
''Study, study !'' at your house.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.351
It's kind of rough when
they don't do that, too.

11:19.124 --> 11:19.852
I don't know.

11:21.860 --> 11:23.418
Oops. Oh, no !
What's the matter ?

11:23.795 --> 11:25.763
I forgot my book !
I have to go back !

11:26.131 --> 11:29.225
Nope ! You'll be late
for your cram session !

11:29.901 --> 11:31.630
I'll call you later.

12:11.076 --> 12:12.566
Sure ! T...that book is...

12:13.311 --> 12:15.905
Oh. Is this yours ?

12:20.919 --> 12:23.046
Here you go...
Tsukishima Shizuku.

12:23.488 --> 12:24.819
How'd you know my name ?

12:26.024 --> 12:27.582
Gee, I wonder how ?

12:30.228 --> 12:31.525
My library card.

12:31.896 --> 12:34.626
You know you should drop
that ''Concrete Road'' thing.

12:41.373 --> 12:43.034
YOU READ IT ! That jerk !

12:44.142 --> 12:50.547
That jerk !That
jerk ! That jerk !

12:54.119 --> 12:55.177
THAT JERK !

13:05.764 --> 13:10.167
''You should drop that
Concrete Road thing...''

13:49.541 --> 13:50.166
I'm back !

13:52.911 --> 13:56.677
Sis, you were due
back today ? I'm beat.

13:57.916 --> 14:00.885
I was lucky to find someone
driving this way and got a ride.

14:03.054 --> 14:03.918
Where's Mom ?

14:04.389 --> 14:07.187
She's still at her summer
class. And Dad's at work.

14:08.193 --> 14:10.127
Shizuku, you should
clean up a little.

14:10.829 --> 14:11.989
Did you make supper yet ?

14:12.497 --> 14:13.521
I was just going to...

14:14.132 --> 14:14.996
What is this ?!

14:15.467 --> 14:16.627
Shizuku, this place is a mess !

14:17.635 --> 14:19.227
I'll go do it now.

14:22.407 --> 14:24.637
Didn't we decide to help
Mom because she's so busy ?

14:31.015 --> 14:32.539
Put away the laundry when
you're done with the rice.

14:33.017 --> 14:34.541
And I'll make dinner
after I shower.

14:37.188 --> 14:38.587
Grandma says

14:38.890 --> 14:40.289
To come on over when
you're in high school.

14:41.626 --> 14:42.422
Doing better with your studies ?

14:43.962 --> 14:45.520
If you slack off just cause
Mom and Dad don't push you...

14:45.864 --> 14:47.923
...you'll really pay for it.

14:48.366 --> 14:49.355
I know !

15:20.031 --> 15:24.161
Shizuku, will you get up already
? And do your own vacuuming.

15:24.836 --> 15:28.567
I'm cleaning bed sheets, so bring
yours ! And put out the futons !

15:30.074 --> 15:32.440
Where's Mom ? She's already gone.

15:37.248 --> 15:39.773
Hurry and clean up then
take this lunch to Dad.

15:40.251 --> 15:41.149
What ?!

15:41.586 --> 15:42.678
What's your problem ?

15:43.121 --> 15:44.088
You're going to
the library, right ?

15:46.224 --> 15:47.748
Or should I go instead ?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.755
If so, then you clean
the bathtub, the toilet

15:51.195 --> 15:52.822
And the front entrance. And
start doing some real chores.

15:53.898 --> 15:57.265
Then put away the futons,
go shopping, and make dinner.

16:00.905 --> 16:02.463
I'll be going !

16:08.947 --> 16:12.883
Shizuku ! Take this
to the mailbox !

16:13.318 --> 16:14.216
What ?

16:14.752 --> 16:16.583
The MAIL

16:17.355 --> 16:19.653
BOX...ah

16:22.760 --> 16:26.753
Don't you dare look ! Don't
forget to take off the clip !

16:27.532 --> 16:29.056
Your boyfriend ? Dummy.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.383
Hey, Kitty Cat. On your own ?

17:33.331 --> 17:34.491
Where are you going ?

17:38.036 --> 17:39.765
Something neat outside ?

17:41.806 --> 17:44.775
Hey ! Answer me, will you ?

17:56.688 --> 17:59.521
I'm getting off
here. How 'bout you ?

18:03.194 --> 18:04.422
See ya, Kitty Cat.

18:39.630 --> 18:40.824
He's heading
towards the library !

19:05.356 --> 19:08.757
Darn, this would've
made such a great story.

19:45.530 --> 19:46.292
There he is !

20:41.152 --> 20:44.713
What a steep hill ! Just
how far does this go ?

21:03.507 --> 21:04.132
Kitty Cat.

21:06.177 --> 21:07.235
Kitty Cat.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.912
I wonder if he
lives around here ?

21:46.484 --> 21:50.648
Where're you going, Kitty Cat
? Do you live around here ?

22:10.107 --> 22:13.543
I had no idea there was
a place like this up here.

22:33.197 --> 22:36.928
What a mean cat His walks
include teasing the dog.

22:48.779 --> 22:52.078
I wonder if he's
teasing me, too ?

23:44.702 --> 23:47.933
I had no idea there were
stores like this here.

24:17.168 --> 24:18.863
What a wonderful figurine.

24:27.044 --> 24:29.103
Are you the cat I saw earlier ?

24:41.358 --> 24:43.417
Oh, welcome ! l, umm...

24:43.994 --> 24:47.088
No, stay right there, stay right
there. Feel free to look around.

24:47.865 --> 24:49.492
The Baron's bored, too.

24:51.102 --> 24:53.570
Is ''Baron'' the name
of this figurine ?

24:54.071 --> 24:57.370
Yup. He's Baron
Vunbert von Jiekingen.

24:57.975 --> 25:01.672
Great name, don't you think ?

25:07.918 --> 25:12.412
Oh, thanks. Thanks. I'm fine now.

25:12.756 --> 25:13.848
Magnificent clock, isn't it ?

25:14.358 --> 25:18.818
It was found in a castle.
It was very badly rusted.

25:22.199 --> 25:25.691
Take a look. How
pretty. What is it ?

25:26.704 --> 25:30.902
You'll find out when it's done.

26:11.482 --> 26:13.473
It's really well made.
Are those dwarves ?

26:14.051 --> 26:14.983
You sure know a lot.

26:15.853 --> 26:18.617
I see, so you know about
dwarves, young lady ?

26:21.192 --> 26:24.821
Now take a look at the numbers.
Let's see if this works.

26:43.547 --> 26:46.710
An elf ! Can you see
alright ? Step up here.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.718
A princess ? That's right.

27:04.902 --> 27:06.267
These two fell in love ?

27:06.737 --> 27:09.604
Yup, but they live
in different worlds.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.637
He's the king of the dwarves.

27:12.476 --> 27:14.637
When the clock strikes twelve

27:14.979 --> 27:17.243
She must return past
the flock to her world.

27:17.681 --> 27:18.511
Even so

27:18.983 --> 27:21.349
He will always
appear at that time

27:21.619 --> 27:22.950
And wait for the princess.

27:24.054 --> 27:26.716
The artisan who made
this clock probably

27:27.191 --> 27:28.920
Had an unrequited love.

27:31.328 --> 27:33.853
So that's why the two
seemed sort of sad.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.863
Is this clock running fast ?

27:39.470 --> 27:41.961
Uh, maybe by five minutes.

27:42.373 --> 27:46.275
Oh, no ! I gotta
get to the library !

27:47.544 --> 27:49.341
Goodbye ! Can I come
visit again, sir ?

27:50.881 --> 27:52.940
If you're going to the
library you should go left !

28:05.896 --> 28:07.193
I'm right above the library !

28:12.903 --> 28:16.202
I've found a cool place ! This
store's like right out of a story !

28:18.108 --> 28:21.509
This is great !

28:21.745 --> 28:23.770
Tsukishima ! Tsukishima Shizuku !

28:27.384 --> 28:30.649
This is yours, right ?

28:34.391 --> 28:35.517
Kinda forgetful, aren't you ?

28:36.427 --> 28:37.860
Thank you. But how...?

28:38.429 --> 28:40.260
Gee, I wonder how ?

28:42.499 --> 28:45.696
The cat ! Is...is
that cat yours ?

28:46.136 --> 28:48.195
You sure eat a pretty big lunch !

28:50.107 --> 28:51.369
WRONG !

28:56.213 --> 28:58.340
YOU'RE WRONG !

29:00.884 --> 29:02.044
HEY ! Oh, you're here already ?

29:05.622 --> 29:07.283
What's with the scary face ?

29:08.225 --> 29:10.716
It's kinda hard to explain. Huh ?

29:11.762 --> 29:13.389
Something wonderful happened

29:13.764 --> 29:14.822
Like finding a cave of treasures.

29:15.399 --> 29:17.299
Then one insensitive
remark made it all collapse.

29:18.102 --> 29:19.797
Sounds complicated.

29:22.473 --> 29:23.462
Here to borrow
books again today ?

29:24.007 --> 29:26.066
Yeah, I still have to
read seven more books.

29:26.710 --> 29:28.701
You just never change.
What about lunch ?

29:29.179 --> 29:33.275
I'll just eat out. Oh,
really. Well, thanks.

29:55.072 --> 29:58.041
June 16th...Amazing...

29:58.375 --> 30:00.570
That Amasawa guy's
read this book, too.

30:01.745 --> 30:03.508
What kind of person is he ?

30:07.084 --> 30:08.711
No, it couldn't be you !

31:02.673 --> 31:04.470
Shizuku, hurry up !

31:06.710 --> 31:07.699
Oh, we'll be late !

31:09.146 --> 31:10.807
Umbrella. The umbrella.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.877
A new semester, and
it just keeps raining.

31:17.254 --> 31:20.189
Stop complaining. You're studying
because you want to, right?

31:22.192 --> 31:23.216
Make sure you study well !

31:23.861 --> 31:24.987
Just leave it to me.

31:33.270 --> 31:34.862
Shizuku ! Hey !

31:35.472 --> 31:36.666
Hurry up or you'll be late.

31:38.509 --> 31:40.238
I hate all these tests.

31:40.744 --> 31:42.268
We've got so many every day.

31:47.885 --> 31:50.445
Did you answer ''them ?'' No.

31:50.687 --> 31:51.551
He didn't write any more ?

31:52.723 --> 31:54.088
No. Maybe I should
just turn him down.

31:54.758 --> 31:57.591
Maybe Yeah, maybe
that's for the best.

31:57.995 --> 31:59.189
Sugimura !

32:00.764 --> 32:02.288
Tsukishima Shizuku

32:03.000 --> 32:04.160
I know that !

32:14.077 --> 32:17.171
Time's up ! Hand in your tests.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.182
Regular schedule this afternoon.

32:28.559 --> 32:30.424
Shizuku, let's go
see Miss Kousaka.

32:31.028 --> 32:32.928
Can we go to the teacher's
lounge first? Okay.

32:33.897 --> 32:35.159
Hey, Tsukishima. Check
this out. What is it ?

32:35.966 --> 32:39.595
I was guessing, but I aced
it ! Oh, such a lucky guy.

32:39.903 --> 32:42.371
I peeked during break and
saw I got a perfect score.

32:42.906 --> 32:44.533
Guess you're not just a
stupid baseball player.

32:45.342 --> 32:47.173
You know Yuuko's
good at guessing, too.

32:47.945 --> 32:50.709
Maybe you should study
together ? With Harada ?

32:51.248 --> 32:52.146
Sugimura, Sugimura !

32:52.583 --> 32:54.210
What's up ? Did you see this ?

32:54.585 --> 32:55.483
Let's go, Shizuku.

33:01.158 --> 33:03.820
Stop trying to get us
together ! Was it obvious ?

33:04.328 --> 33:07.297
I was never good at
guessing ! Sorry !

33:09.032 --> 33:10.363
Excuse us.

33:13.904 --> 33:17.237
The donor of a book ? And
you think I would know ?

33:17.641 --> 33:18.938
Sorry to bother you during lunch.

33:19.476 --> 33:20.704
It's this imprint here.

33:21.411 --> 33:28.408
Let's see... Oh, that's Amasawa !

33:29.186 --> 33:31.017
I've read this, too.
Great book, isn't it ?

33:31.622 --> 33:32.748
Yes, definitely.

33:33.190 --> 33:35.590
So exactly what kind of
person is this Amasawa ?

33:36.360 --> 33:39.921
It was a few years ago.
He was the head of the PTA.

33:40.430 --> 33:43.763
The PTA's... Um, do you
know his first name ?

33:44.101 --> 33:46.569
First name ? Let's
see...Mr. Kimura...

33:47.170 --> 33:49.161
...remember what Amasawa's name was
? You know, at Amasawa Hospital ?

33:49.573 --> 33:53.839
Amasawa ? I'm pretty sure it
was Kouichi. Amasawa Kouichi.

33:54.378 --> 33:55.606
Amasawa Kouichi...

33:56.279 --> 33:58.179
Tsukishima... one
of Amasawa's children

33:58.682 --> 34:01.378
ln the same grade as you
Didn't you know that ?

34:01.885 --> 34:04.945
Wha...?! l, uh...
Thank you very much !

34:06.923 --> 34:07.890
Sorry to bother you.

34:09.326 --> 34:10.350
Sorry about that.

34:12.896 --> 34:14.989
Shizuku, where're you going !?

34:17.868 --> 34:20.996
What a surprise ! I'm the
one who should be surprised !

34:21.571 --> 34:23.061
I think you owe me an
explanation for this.

34:24.741 --> 34:25.900
Oh, sorry.

34:35.585 --> 34:37.246
Which way are you
going, Shizuku ?

34:54.404 --> 34:56.463
What nerve ! Acting like
he didn't even see me !

34:56.907 --> 34:59.171
Who was that, Shizuku ?
Where're you going ?

34:59.609 --> 35:01.907
That guy's a jerk ! But I
won't run from him, either !

35:02.813 --> 35:07.978
Oh, how cute !

35:10.587 --> 35:12.782
Tsukishima noticed boys, huh ?

35:13.123 --> 35:16.820
Hey, Teach, I think spring has
finally arrived for Shizuku, too !

35:17.294 --> 35:18.818
I told you that isn't it !

35:19.429 --> 35:22.296
You actually met the Prince
of Books, then, right ?

35:23.066 --> 35:23.828
Is he handsome ?

35:24.234 --> 35:26.464
Look, I just wondered
what kind of person he is.

35:26.703 --> 35:28.864
Hey, Yuuko. You know
the guy's name, right ?

35:29.206 --> 35:30.264
So tell us.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.106
Yuuko !

35:32.542 --> 35:34.601
Well, it was just
a brief mention.

35:34.845 --> 35:39.612
I think it started with ''Ma''
something, or Masagi whatever ?

35:39.916 --> 35:40.848
''Ama...''

35:41.218 --> 35:44.051
That's just like
Tsukishima to leave

35:44.488 --> 35:45.819
Without hearing the whole story.

35:46.323 --> 35:48.120
She wants to know but she
doesn't want to know, right ?

35:49.626 --> 35:52.595
The hopeful heart suffers
so ... Isn't it great ?

35:53.263 --> 35:55.891
Well, it's romantic, anyway.

35:57.033 --> 35:58.762
Fine, just go on and
tease me like that.

35:59.536 --> 36:02.096
And after I wrote the verses
for Country Road and all.

36:02.539 --> 36:04.063
You finished ? Let's
see !~~Let's see !

36:06.610 --> 36:08.510
Great Shizuku !
Mistress of verse !

36:09.179 --> 36:11.079
We promise to behave,
so please show us !

36:11.948 --> 36:15.748
Very well. Actually,
I'm not too confident.

36:17.487 --> 36:19.978
I'm still not too sure
what ''country home'' means.

36:20.357 --> 36:22.222
So I just had to go
with what I felt on that.

36:22.926 --> 36:24.450
You outdid yourself.

36:25.495 --> 36:35.496
''Country road.'' ''It'll take
me, back to my home town.''

36:35.906 --> 36:40.309
''I can feel it now,
if I just keep to...''

36:40.844 --> 36:45.645
''...this far-off
way, country road.''

36:46.216 --> 36:48.377
It's great, Shizuku. I like it.

36:49.085 --> 36:51.815
It's not too hard to sing
? I think we can manage.

36:52.189 --> 36:53.781
It'd be wasted if we gave
it to the underclassmen.

36:54.357 --> 36:56.325
We should sing this at
the thank you party, too.

36:56.693 --> 36:58.490
What ? The thank you party
? lmpulsive, aren't you ?

36:58.895 --> 37:01.363
This part's good. ''Living
here all on my own.''

37:01.898 --> 37:04.264
''Owning no possessions, I
made my way out of town.''

37:04.734 --> 37:08.636
''I must put my loneliness away...and
protect myself, I'll learn to be strong''

37:08.905 --> 37:11.430
All of you, school
bell's ringing.

37:18.582 --> 37:20.345
Yes, ma'am ! The sky's
clear ! It's clear !

37:21.251 --> 37:22.218
Shizuku !

37:22.853 --> 37:26.414
You wanna go to the choir?
We'll show them this song.

37:26.656 --> 37:28.521
It's okay, I have
to go to the library.

37:29.192 --> 37:30.887
Huh ? We've got tests
tomorrow, you know.

37:31.695 --> 37:32.684
I'll study at the library.

37:33.096 --> 37:35.064
You really like it there !

37:35.732 --> 37:36.858
See ya !

38:12.936 --> 38:14.028
Bye-bye !

38:16.840 --> 38:20.037
Harada...Listen, I'm sorry,
but can I talk to you ?

38:29.953 --> 38:34.583
Have the flowers been watered ?

38:47.037 --> 38:48.504
The Baron's gone !

38:49.339 --> 38:50.806
I wonder if he was sold ?

39:00.850 --> 39:04.411
Atelier Chikyuu-ya Nishi Shirou I
wonder if he's named Nishi, too ?

39:18.535 --> 39:20.901
Shizuku ! Shizuku !

39:26.443 --> 39:28.206
You've got a call from Yuuko !

39:29.145 --> 39:31.113
You'll ruin your ears, Shizuku.

39:31.748 --> 39:35.411
Yuuko ? I can't hear you.

39:36.853 --> 39:39.617
Right. I'll be
right there. Right.

39:40.190 --> 39:41.350
Okay, bye.

39:42.325 --> 39:44.088
Where're you going ? Not too far.

39:51.368 --> 39:52.494
What's wrong, Yuuko ?

39:54.004 --> 39:57.940
Shizuku...What's wrong ?
What's with that look ?

39:58.375 --> 40:00.536
What should I do, Shizuku ?

40:00.844 --> 40:02.869
Sugimura's friend asked him

40:03.580 --> 40:05.673
To get an answer from me.

40:07.751 --> 40:10.845
Oh, boy...

40:11.921 --> 40:13.445
Why do you have to
be the go-between ?!

40:20.597 --> 40:22.258
Hey ! He's just kinda stupid.

40:23.233 --> 40:26.725
And besides, Sugimura probably
doesn't know how you really feel.

40:29.439 --> 40:30.804
I'll apologize to Sugimura.

40:31.708 --> 40:35.838
But I can't go to school looking like
this. I'm skipping school tomorrow.

40:36.613 --> 40:38.547
The test, too ?

40:40.250 --> 40:41.046
Yes.

41:08.278 --> 41:09.506
I think I did pretty well.

41:09.913 --> 41:11.278
Shizuku, library again today ?

41:11.748 --> 41:12.942
I'm going to Yuuko's
place to see her.

41:13.716 --> 41:14.512
Oh, say hi to her for us.

41:15.051 --> 41:16.075
Okay. Bye-bye
! Bye-bye !

41:23.593 --> 41:24.685
Tsukishima !

41:26.362 --> 41:27.522
Hold up !

41:34.571 --> 41:36.198
Look, it's about Harada...

41:43.446 --> 41:45.880
...and then she
suddenly started to cry.

41:46.483 --> 41:48.451
So did I say something
wrong or what ?

41:50.520 --> 41:51.350
Sugimura...

41:52.155 --> 41:55.181
...didn't Yuuko ask
you why you did that ?

41:55.925 --> 41:58.655
Yeah. Like I said, my friend
on the team asked me...

41:59.129 --> 42:03.293
Wrong! She meant she really
didn't want you to do that.

42:03.933 --> 42:05.093
You understand what that means ?

42:05.802 --> 42:08.703
I don't ! Spell it out for me !

42:09.606 --> 42:14.270
Geez, you really are stupid ! It
means Yuuko's in love with you !

42:14.744 --> 42:18.202
Huh ?!But, then...
Man, that's a problem.

42:18.715 --> 42:21.343
A problem...! Poor Yuuko's
the one with the problem !

42:21.851 --> 42:23.682
She stayed home
because of the shock !

42:25.088 --> 42:28.615
B...but, l... I'm
in love with you !

42:30.560 --> 42:32.391
O...oh, no. You shouldn't
joke around like that !

42:32.862 --> 42:35.797
I'm not joking !I've been in
love with you for a long time !

42:37.267 --> 42:39.929
You can't ! I mean...
l...well...but...

42:40.537 --> 42:43.370
Do you hate me ? Are you
going out with someone ?

42:44.040 --> 42:48.477
I'm not going out with
anybody... B...but...

42:49.412 --> 42:50.470
I'm sorry ! Wait !

42:51.247 --> 42:53.010
Tsukishima, you have to tell me !

42:53.650 --> 42:55.174
We've always been friends
so I do like you, Sugimura.

42:55.685 --> 42:58.950
But when you mean in that way...

43:02.659 --> 43:05.150
I'm sorry. I can't
say this right...

43:11.367 --> 43:16.669
You mean we're just
friends? Even after this ?

44:11.127 --> 44:14.153
Dummy ! The only stupid
one was yourself !

44:25.141 --> 44:27.632
Just a minute, Tsukishima.
You got a package.

44:28.344 --> 44:30.335
Oh, thanks so much again.

44:44.761 --> 44:45.489
You're so nice,
always giving us stuff.

44:45.928 --> 44:48.897
Oh, don't worry, we
can't eat it all anyway.

44:50.233 --> 44:51.359
Oh, you're home ?

44:52.935 --> 44:53.697
Shizuku ?

46:14.817 --> 46:15.977
Yoo-hoo.

46:18.454 --> 46:19.819
Did you get locked out, too ?

46:23.693 --> 46:26.093
Is this house your home ?

46:26.362 --> 46:27.920
Are you hungry ?

46:30.867 --> 46:34.667
Well, you're not cute,
either. Just like me.

46:37.206 --> 46:38.298
Why did I have to change ?

46:38.975 --> 46:41.876
I used to be such a nice
and honest kid before.

46:42.845 --> 46:43.743
Even when I'm reading a book

46:44.247 --> 46:46.147
I don't feel the
excitement I used to.

46:46.916 --> 46:49.851
Now it's like someone whispering in my
heart saying that I can't go on like this.

46:50.086 --> 46:53.783
I'm not cute at all.

47:19.515 --> 47:20.846
Hey, it's Tsukishima.

47:23.085 --> 47:27.112
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.
Hey, Moon, aren't you here to visit ?

47:27.757 --> 47:29.088
Is the cat's name Moon ?

47:29.592 --> 47:33.460
Doesn't he look like a full moon
? That's why I call him Moon.

47:38.401 --> 47:40.335
You mean Moon isn't your cat ?

47:40.803 --> 47:42.430
You can't tell cats what to do.

47:42.872 --> 47:45.238
I think he's called
''Egg'' at another house.

47:46.042 --> 47:47.737
He probably has other names.

47:49.345 --> 47:50.539
So he's a stray, then.

47:52.348 --> 47:55.146
That's right ! Moon
commutes by taking the train.

47:56.118 --> 47:57.142
The train ?

47:57.587 --> 47:59.282
That's right. He was
riding the train by himself.

47:59.789 --> 48:01.620
I followed him and came here.

48:02.225 --> 48:04.056
And then here's
this wonderful store.

48:04.594 --> 48:06.687
It's like a fairy
tale inside the store.

48:07.864 --> 48:08.888
I said some bad things about him.

48:09.999 --> 48:14.060
I told him he wasn't cute,
and that he was just like me.

48:15.004 --> 48:17.802
Moon is like you ? You
don't look alike at all !

48:19.942 --> 48:21.933
T...that cat must be
at least half ghost.

48:29.819 --> 48:30.649
And you...

48:33.456 --> 48:34.616
Is the store owner okay ?

48:35.091 --> 48:37.252
I was wondering, since the
store's been closed for a while.

48:37.627 --> 48:38.651
Oh, he's just fine.

48:39.061 --> 48:41.325
This store's kind of strange
it's closed more often than not.

48:41.664 --> 48:43.222
Oh, that's good to know.

48:43.733 --> 48:44.700
I peeked through the window

48:45.101 --> 48:46.932
But I couldn't see the
Baron. I thought he was sold.

48:47.703 --> 48:50.263
Oh, the cat figurine ?
Wanna see ? Come on.

49:01.717 --> 49:02.911
Close the door

49:23.005 --> 49:24.734
It's like we're floating up here.

49:34.016 --> 49:34.880
Are you scared of heights ?

49:35.518 --> 49:37.952
No, I like high places.
It's beautiful...

49:44.927 --> 49:48.260
The view is nicest around
this time. Over here.

50:11.654 --> 50:14.350
That's good. Sit over there.

50:14.857 --> 50:16.085
The clock's gone !

50:16.892 --> 50:18.553
Oh, the one that was there ?

50:19.862 --> 50:22.422
It was delivered
today. Come over here.

50:22.898 --> 50:23.887
Did it get sold ?

50:24.834 --> 50:26.461
It was only here for repairs.

50:27.870 --> 50:29.462
I see. I wanted to see it again.

50:29.905 --> 50:31.031
It took three years.

50:31.641 --> 50:33.438
It was finished the day
you left your lunch here.

50:34.443 --> 50:35.341
Oh, that lunch...

50:35.778 --> 50:37.643
Yeah, I know it wasn't yours.

50:38.214 --> 50:40.614
Now come here and take
a look at the cat's eye.

50:43.019 --> 50:45.544
Hurry up. The light's
starting to fade.

50:57.733 --> 51:00.133
''Engels Zimmer.''

51:00.970 --> 51:01.994
That's German for
''Angel's Room.''

51:02.438 --> 51:04.531
The artisan accidentally scratched
it when he was sewing up the clothes.

51:04.874 --> 51:05.636
It's so pretty.

51:06.308 --> 51:09.175
The Baron won't be sold.
It's Grandpa's treasure.

51:10.012 --> 51:11.070
His treasure ?

51:12.415 --> 51:15.680
It seems to hold some sort of memories
for him. Only he won't say what.

51:16.619 --> 51:19.349
Look at it for as long as
you want. I'll be downstairs.

51:23.492 --> 51:25.551
The light switch is over
there. Turn it on if you want.

51:39.041 --> 51:43.705
Strange. It's as if
I've always known you.

51:44.313 --> 51:47.146
I kept wanting to see
you every once in a while.

51:51.153 --> 51:53.713
You seem so very sad today.

52:56.018 --> 52:58.851
Oh, are you done ? Yeah, thanks.

53:00.122 --> 53:03.091
Uh, are you making
a violin ? Y...yeah.

53:05.961 --> 53:06.893
Can I see ? Sure.

53:12.134 --> 53:13.032
It'll look like this.

53:13.902 --> 53:17.269
Did you make this all by hand ?

53:17.973 --> 53:18.871
Of course.

53:19.441 --> 53:20.373
I can't believe it !

53:21.176 --> 53:23.838
They perfected the violin's
design three hundred years ago.

53:24.580 --> 53:27.743
The quality of its sound is
determined by the skill of the maker.

53:29.485 --> 53:30.816
Did you make all those, too ?

53:31.420 --> 53:34.753
Course not ! We hold
violin making classes here.

53:35.958 --> 53:38.586
But you made one of
them, didn't you ? Yeah.

53:39.528 --> 53:40.927
Which one is it ? That one.

53:41.296 --> 53:41.990
Wow ! This one ?

53:42.664 --> 53:47.067
It's amazing that
you could make this.

53:47.803 --> 53:48.929
It's like magic.

53:50.005 --> 53:53.497
Geez, you sure know
how to embarrass a guy.

53:54.443 --> 53:56.707
What's wrong with that
? It's only what I think.

53:57.646 --> 53:59.273
Anybody can make
something like that.

54:01.517 --> 54:03.075
I'm still not very good.

54:10.092 --> 54:13.550
So, can you play
the violin ? Sort of.

54:13.996 --> 54:16.021
Will you play for me ?
Just a little bit ?

54:16.532 --> 54:19.467
Oh, c'mon ! Please !
Please ! Pretty please !

54:20.502 --> 54:22.527
Fine, but you have to sing !

54:24.339 --> 54:29.436
What ? F...forget
it ! I can't sing !
