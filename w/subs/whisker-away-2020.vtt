00:17.225 --> 00:21.896
<i>I want to help you.</i>
<i>I want to hear you say, "I love you."</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:40.206
Where am I?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.548
What is this place?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.967
Where is everyone?

01:03.980 --> 01:06.357
Are you lost?

01:15.283 --> 01:16.117
Miyo...

01:16.993 --> 01:19.871
Could you tell your father
you want to live with me?

01:19.954 --> 01:22.624
We can be together every day.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.463
He's going to marry her, right?

01:29.589 --> 01:33.551
Maybe. She's already living with us.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.179
-Oh, man.
-Not a single fish.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.390
-You're all so selfish.
-Miyo...

01:40.058 --> 01:42.852
I don't blame you.
You have every reason to be angry!

01:44.104 --> 01:47.107
But there are just some things
you won't understand until you're older--

01:47.190 --> 01:49.776
Then stop telling me things
I don't understand!

01:50.902 --> 01:52.695
Miyo! Wait!

02:05.583 --> 02:06.543
I hate this.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.045
I hate this stupid world.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.632
I hope the world ends soon.

02:12.715 --> 02:17.428
CAT LANTERN

02:28.439 --> 02:29.399
Masks?

02:30.275 --> 02:34.362
Welcome. Do you want to try one on?

02:59.053 --> 03:00.847
Yori!

03:01.639 --> 03:02.932
Morning!

03:03.016 --> 03:05.768
Oh, hey. What is it?

03:06.644 --> 03:08.688
Grumpy as usual, I see!

03:09.689 --> 03:12.525
-But gorgeous as always!
-What are you talking about?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.155
What's the matter?

03:23.953 --> 03:27.373
-Sorry! Take care of my bag!
-You really shouldn't--

03:31.336 --> 03:34.088
-My older sister is awful.
-Oh, yeah. Really?

03:46.309 --> 03:47.143
I did it!

03:47.227 --> 03:51.147
Hinode Sunrise... Attack!

03:51.856 --> 03:53.107
Seriously, knock it off.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.028
It's an expression of love!

03:58.488 --> 04:00.615
Hinode, wait!

04:01.824 --> 04:04.911
-Wait up, Hinode! Hinode!
-I can't wait.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.249
That was unbelievably sexy!

04:09.332 --> 04:12.627
Did you hear that?
He said, "I can't wait."

04:12.710 --> 04:14.837
That sounded so suggestive!

04:15.213 --> 04:20.051
Like, "Can I kiss you?"
"Wait!" "I can't wait."

04:20.134 --> 04:22.553
-And then our eyes met! It was crazy!
-Morning!

04:22.637 --> 04:24.764
-What?! That's awesome!
-And then what?

04:24.847 --> 04:26.182
That's it, unfortunately...

04:26.266 --> 04:28.851
I got to hear Hinode's sexy voice.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.104
I can die happy right now.
You get it, right?

04:31.187 --> 04:35.441
-Not one bit.
-Hinode, you should be nicer to Muge.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.567
I agree.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.778
-You should whisper in her ear...
-Ignore them.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.863
...with that sexy voice of yours and--

04:42.240 --> 04:44.534
That hurt! What's your problem?

04:44.784 --> 04:48.705
Shut up! Zip it! Stuff it!
Shut up, shut up!

04:50.790 --> 04:54.043
Hey, Hinode!
Let me record your voice on my phone!

04:54.127 --> 04:58.881
I'll listen to it before I sleep.
My dreams will be amazing!

04:59.507 --> 05:02.677
No wonder everyone calls her "Muge,"
Miss Ultra Gaga and Enigmatic.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.221
"I can't wait." He actually said that!

05:11.602 --> 05:13.771
This is just sad.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.189
What is?

05:15.523 --> 05:18.609
He clearly isn't interested,
but you won't give up. It's depressing.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.279
I see. But still...

05:21.362 --> 05:25.033
No other girl is as close to him
as I am. That means I'm special, right?

05:25.116 --> 05:27.452
You're speaking like a true stalker...

05:27.785 --> 05:29.996
Tell me. Why is it Hinode?

05:30.204 --> 05:34.375
He used to give you signals to back off.
Now he just ignores you.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.127
-Yori!
-What?

05:36.377 --> 05:37.754
Are you curious?

05:39.005 --> 05:41.841
Remember that time it rained
during the festival?

05:42.717 --> 05:45.887
The one I couldn't attend because
of my grandmother's memorial service?

05:46.888 --> 05:52.268
<i>That day... We huddled together,</i>
<i>just the two of us.</i>

05:52.643 --> 05:55.521
<i>It was so quiet you couldn't tell</i>
<i>there was a festival going on.</i>

05:57.607 --> 05:59.734
It's like everything else has disappeared.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.152
You're right.

06:01.444 --> 06:05.198
The world is filled with things I hate
and things I don't need.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.952
But if there's nothing
when I step out of here...

06:11.245 --> 06:13.039
I wouldn't want that.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.211
Who knew you were such a romantic!

06:19.796 --> 06:21.756
I wouldn't want that to happen.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.018
That tickles!

06:35.895 --> 06:38.981
You laugh like a little child.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.486
<i>I was sick of this world,</i>
<i>but now I know it isn't so bad.</i>

06:44.195 --> 06:45.947
Because I met Hinode after all.

06:46.948 --> 06:47.990
Muge!

06:48.574 --> 06:49.992
-Your ice cream!
-Get a grip!

06:50.076 --> 06:53.746
You're getting your fantasies
confused with reality!

06:54.622 --> 06:56.165
And there goes my ice cream too...

06:56.249 --> 06:59.168
This is just sad. I don't like it!

06:59.794 --> 07:05.007
Earth to Muge! Come back to us!

07:05.091 --> 07:08.386
It really happened, though.
Why won't you believe--

07:14.892 --> 07:16.936
I didn't know you hated cats.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.313
It depends on the time, place, and cat.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.859
Later, Yori!

07:22.942 --> 07:25.945
Don't forget to be
my friend again tomorrow, okay?

07:26.028 --> 07:28.698
Don't be silly. See you.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.032
Bye!

07:40.334 --> 07:41.252
Miyo!

07:43.004 --> 07:44.338
Miyo!

07:45.298 --> 07:47.383
-Hello...
-Are you all right?

07:47.967 --> 07:50.344
Oh, my! Have you lost weight?

07:50.428 --> 07:52.513
-No, not really...
-You're all skin and bones!

07:52.597 --> 07:55.057
I haven't lost any weight...

07:55.766 --> 08:00.146
You don't know how sorry
I feel for you, Miyo.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.941
-You don't have to, really. I'm--
-Is she feeding you?

08:04.025 --> 08:05.276
Yes, of course.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.320
She's living with you, right?

08:07.737 --> 08:10.364
Is she forcing you
to eat food you don't like?

08:10.448 --> 08:11.908
-Not really...
-Miyo.

08:12.241 --> 08:16.120
-Oh, my! Hello there!
-Hello.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.538
Bye now, Miyo.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.583
-I have to go now.
-Goodbye.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.799
They can't stop nosing around
once they reach her age, huh?

08:28.883 --> 08:30.343
I'm back, Ms. Kaoru.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.136
Welcome back, Miyo.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.597
Kinako!

08:38.392 --> 08:40.978
The weather report says
it'll be sunny tomorrow too.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.105
I'll be airing out
the futon mattresses, so...

08:43.606 --> 08:46.692
-You don't have to worry about mine.
-It'll be fluffier after I air it out.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.903
It's fine! I'll do it myself next time.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.947
-I shouldn't trouble you.
-I don't mind at all.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.326
Kinako!

08:58.246 --> 08:59.830
I'm back, Kinako.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.710
I guess you have to raise them
from a young age to make them like you.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.463
There's ice cream in the fridge.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.925
Thanks, but I already had one
on my way home.

09:11.008 --> 09:11.842
Really?

09:11.926 --> 09:15.263
You should help yourself, Ms. Kaoru.
You and Kinako.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.639
Okay...

09:18.140 --> 09:20.601
-I'll let you know when dinner is ready.
-Okay!

09:22.019 --> 09:23.896
Kinako, do you want a snack?

09:28.526 --> 09:32.405
I know she's trying to be nice,
but she should just leave me alone.

09:32.488 --> 09:36.701
I have my own plans.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.411
Where is it?

09:46.544 --> 09:48.879
I have my own plans.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.145
Tacky.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.834
Yumi.

10:26.959 --> 10:31.213
At least help me fold the laundry.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.382
Do I have to?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.550
I'm home.

10:34.925 --> 10:35.885
Welcome back.

10:36.677 --> 10:37.720
Kento?

10:38.137 --> 10:39.972
Hup!

10:43.017 --> 10:46.896
Explain yourself.
Why didn't you hand this in?

10:48.814 --> 10:50.358
You're going to Ichi High, right?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.526
I'm still thinking about it.

10:52.860 --> 10:57.156
You have to take this seriously.
We're depending on you to support us.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.827
You're expecting the son to
feed the family? That's so old-fashioned.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.329
You haven't contributed anything.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.914
-I'm home, Dad.
-Okay, okay...

11:06.332 --> 11:09.168
If you're going to your grandpa's,
finish your homework first.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.378
I don't have homework.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.300
-Mom, your panties are huge!
-Be quiet!

11:29.313 --> 11:30.356
Taro?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.150
Taro?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.319
She isn't here yet?

11:39.198 --> 11:40.199
Taro!

11:43.202 --> 11:44.078
Taro?

12:01.429 --> 12:02.471
Taro.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.232
You smell like the sun.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.572
<i>Hinode...</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:24.160
Ken?

12:25.077 --> 12:26.245
What are you doing?

12:30.541 --> 12:33.252
She has a lot on her mind.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.837
Don't worry about it.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.299
You're a lot smarter than I am.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.801
I can see why Sachiko
has high hopes for you.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.262
But I think you're cool, Grandpa.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.276
The state of your heart
will always show in your work.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.444
Yes, sir...

13:00.321 --> 13:01.405
Are you hungry?

13:06.327 --> 13:08.329
I'm going to borrow your kitchen, Grandpa.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.372
Okay, let's take a break.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.250
Today's your lucky day, Taro.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.254
You like Ken's cooking, don't you?

13:24.678 --> 13:28.432
She never grooms herself
or sharpens her claws.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.184
What a strange cat.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.353
So scary!

13:34.730 --> 13:37.983
You're Taro's reincarnation, aren't you?

13:41.070 --> 13:44.156
I bet other people are feeding her too.
She'll get fat.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.034
I prefer chubby cats.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.328
They shouldn't be obese, of course.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.252
Taro, you're leaving already?

14:03.050 --> 14:05.010
I bet she has plenty of homes
to go back to.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.339
Oh, shoot!

14:54.977 --> 14:57.605
Oh, my gosh! That was amazing!

14:58.230 --> 15:03.569
"You're leaving already?"
Oh, my gosh! He's so dreamy!

15:05.404 --> 15:06.447
Oh, shoot!

15:09.700 --> 15:11.744
Yes... Wait...

15:17.333 --> 15:21.670
A cat! It's a cat, Mommy! It's so cute!

15:21.754 --> 15:25.424
What? Why didn't you tell me
Taro was here?

15:25.966 --> 15:28.218
I bought a treat for her.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.890
Hey, are you still here? Taro?

15:33.474 --> 15:36.644
She left without greeting her owner.
How rude!

15:36.936 --> 15:40.314
She isn't our pet.
And I found her, not you.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.901
That rainy festival day, right?

15:44.234 --> 15:48.280
You skipped out on cram school,
and our dear mother blew her gasket.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.991
I'll be going now!

15:51.867 --> 15:53.577
Okay. Thanks for today.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.371
Thank you!

15:57.706 --> 15:58.916
Shut up.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.834
I didn't say anything.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.006
<i>That day...</i>

16:08.092 --> 16:09.718
TENNO FESTIVAL

16:17.977 --> 16:20.354
Fine. Then I'll stop going.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.898
It's just a waste of money, right?

16:23.774 --> 16:25.025
I don't really care.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.530
I don't even want to go to cram school.
I'm hanging up now.

17:01.687 --> 17:05.107
<i>That was the day I met Taro.</i>

17:15.909 --> 17:19.204
<i>I wish I didn't have to go</i>
<i>to the bathroom in this body.</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:24.334
I'll fight you, you brown tabby!

17:29.381 --> 17:31.258
Oh, it's just you.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.927
You should have gone to Hinode's place.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.347
You'd get to spend more time with him.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.391
No way! I have to wipe my butt, okay?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.643
Cats don't need toilet paper.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.854
We clean ourselves with our tongue.
It's eco-friendly.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.814
That's disgusting!

17:45.898 --> 17:48.609
You have to be more open-minded.

17:49.193 --> 17:54.198
You should enjoy living like a cat.
It'll be such a waste if you don't.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.158
I'm having a blast, okay?!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.619
Oh, really?

17:59.203 --> 18:03.916
In that case, you can keep that mask.
Give me your human face in exchange.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.752
-What?
-You don't need it anymore, do you?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.212
No way!

18:10.089 --> 18:13.175
I sell cat masks to humans
who want to be cats.

18:13.258 --> 18:18.180
I sell human masks to cats who
want to be humans. That's my job.

18:18.263 --> 18:23.102
You have a wonderful cat life
ahead of you now.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.062
Stop following me!

18:25.145 --> 18:29.233
Throw away your tiresome human face.
Enjoy your sweet cat life!

18:32.402 --> 18:34.154
Huh? He disappeared.

18:35.489 --> 18:39.034
What's his problem?
"Enjoy your sweet cat life," my butt.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.622
I'm rooting for you.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.631
You should tell Hinode
who "Taro" really is.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.635
Tell him, "It was me, Muge, all along."

18:57.594 --> 19:00.681
He'll lose the frosty attitude
and fall head over heels for you.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.518
No way. No, that's never going to happen.

19:04.935 --> 19:09.148
First of all, he'd never believe me.
And even if he did,

19:09.439 --> 19:12.151
what if it backfires
and he ends up hating Taro instead?

19:13.193 --> 19:15.195
I should gather more information as Taro,

19:15.279 --> 19:17.906
and then use what I know
to get closer to him as Muge.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.617
If that's your plan,
it doesn't seem to be working.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.704
Shut up! Shut it! Shut up! Buzz off!

19:24.163 --> 19:26.290
You know what? You're so shady!

19:26.707 --> 19:29.459
You don't charge anything
for swapping cat and human masks.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.461
What's in it for you?

19:31.920 --> 19:34.506
I'm just doing my best
to reduce, reuse, and recycle!

19:34.590 --> 19:35.674
Liar!

19:36.133 --> 19:36.967
What?

19:40.053 --> 19:41.221
Wait, what?

19:45.601 --> 19:48.437
Boiled potatoes! Boiled potatoes!

19:48.520 --> 19:52.232
Oh, Miyo.
You really like these, don't you?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.947
Now, open wide!

20:03.160 --> 20:05.120
-Hey!
-Open wide!

20:07.915 --> 20:11.335
-It's so good! I love it!
-Really?

20:12.628 --> 20:15.672
Miyo, have some boiled potatoes.
You like them, right?

20:17.758 --> 20:18.842
Is it too bland?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.552
Not at all. It's delicious.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.764
It's healthier this way.
It tastes like haute cuisine.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.515
Really?

20:25.891 --> 20:26.934
Right, Miyo?

20:27.351 --> 20:28.769
I've never had haute cuisine.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.606
Kids like me prefer fatty meat
and strong flavors.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.107
You'll get fat.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.236
Hinode said he likes it better
when I'm chubby.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.613
Hinode? Who's that? Is he your boyfriend?

20:40.447 --> 20:41.823
None of your business.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
He is, isn't he? What's he like?

20:45.535 --> 20:46.995
Did you know about this, Kaoru?

20:47.287 --> 20:48.247
No...

20:48.330 --> 20:51.750
You should bring him home
and introduce him to Kaoru!

20:51.833 --> 20:52.668
What?

20:52.751 --> 20:56.129
You're both women. She'll be
more comfortable discussing this with you.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.965
You can talk to Kaoru about anything.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.635
Is he in the same grade?
Or is he your senior?

21:02.719 --> 21:04.346
Who confessed to whom?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.682
He isn't my boyfriend, okay?

21:06.765 --> 21:08.016
Don't be shy. Right?

21:08.392 --> 21:13.105
<i>Just leave me alone already.</i>
<i>I know I don't belong here.</i>

21:16.775 --> 21:17.776
That's right!

21:18.110 --> 21:21.405
I'm going to marry Hinode...

21:21.863 --> 21:23.824
and move out of here as soon as I can!

21:23.991 --> 21:25.450
In order to do so...

21:27.911 --> 21:29.913
I can't let this chance slip away.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.500
I love him,
and not just because he took me in.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.087
<i>He named me, a female cat, "Taro."</i>

21:37.587 --> 21:42.926
<i>That was the name of his previous dog.</i>
<i>He's so loyal.</i>

21:44.177 --> 21:47.889
<i>He's smart,</i>
<i>but he doesn't take it for granted.</i>

21:49.182 --> 21:50.392
Taro!

21:50.976 --> 21:53.228
<i>I know what he's really like.</i>

21:53.437 --> 21:56.273
<i>He ignores me when I'm Muge,</i>
<i>and that makes me sad.</i>

21:58.233 --> 22:01.737
<i>But when I'm Taro, he's so sweet to me.</i>

22:07.034 --> 22:08.869
I love you, Taro.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.332
You always smell like the sun.

22:13.957 --> 22:14.916
<i>Hinode!</i>

22:15.334 --> 22:17.669
<i>I... I'm actually...</i>

22:19.504 --> 22:20.380
What is it?

22:22.924 --> 22:24.009
<i>I can't do it.</i>

22:25.010 --> 22:27.679
<i>I don't have the courage</i>
<i>to tell him I'm Muge.</i>

22:33.852 --> 22:35.437
You're so lucky, Taro.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.232
<i>What's wrong, Hinode?</i>

22:39.941 --> 22:42.152
<i>How can I help you?</i>

22:43.070 --> 22:44.780
I have to make my lunch for tomorrow.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.574
<i>He's making his own lunch box?</i>

22:48.950 --> 22:50.035
<i>I want to eat it...</i>

22:52.621 --> 22:57.042
Hinode! Sunrise Attack!

23:01.880 --> 23:03.632
Come on, Muge...

23:06.468 --> 23:07.594
It's time for lunch.

23:08.595 --> 23:09.513
Here, 50 yen.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.894
My father made my lunch box today.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.188
So you're having rice ball bombs
for lunch today, right?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.481
Yup.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.774
Lucky you!

23:20.857 --> 23:25.237
Are you kidding? I'll have to
dislodge my jaw to eat them.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.614
And the seaweed is always soggy.

23:28.156 --> 23:31.827
Miss Ultra Gaga and Enigmatic.
Pesky, barbaric she-gorilla.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.204
Why's she so obsessed with Hinode lately?

23:34.287 --> 23:35.163
Who knows?

23:35.705 --> 23:37.791
It's getting on my nerves.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.086
I feel sorry for Hinode.
This is "the Muge" we're talking about.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.879
-I know, right?
-What's their problem?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.757
Let them talk, I don't care.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.927
Speaking of Hinode,
he's been acting smug lately.

23:49.052 --> 23:49.886
You think so?

23:50.303 --> 23:51.763
All high and mighty.

23:52.097 --> 23:52.973
What?

23:53.306 --> 23:56.226
His grades shot up. It makes no sense!

23:56.977 --> 23:58.687
He must have cheated on the tests.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.439
His grades were like mine back in--

24:00.522 --> 24:03.191
Muge? What are you planning to do?

24:03.483 --> 24:05.026
-Food food!
-Thanks for the food.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.695
No, don't!

24:07.154 --> 24:11.950
Muge, calm down! Muge!
Someone stop her, please!

24:12.451 --> 24:15.537
What was that about Hinode? Take it back!

24:15.620 --> 24:17.289
-What? Are you crazy?
-What is she...

24:17.914 --> 24:18.957
Muge?

24:20.834 --> 24:21.751
What?

24:23.378 --> 24:25.922
Muge!

24:31.928 --> 24:33.263
What's with you?

24:34.014 --> 24:36.725
This is so much easier when I'm a cat.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.854
-Blood! I'm bleeding!
-Are you crazy?

24:41.354 --> 24:43.440
That's my line!

24:43.523 --> 24:44.524
What?

24:44.608 --> 24:45.650
Hinode is always--

24:46.610 --> 24:48.487
He works really hard!

24:49.070 --> 24:51.865
-Stop lying about him, or I'll--
-Muge!

24:54.284 --> 24:55.410
Are you okay?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.580
"Are you okay?"

25:00.874 --> 25:02.667
-Hey, let's go.
-Yeah.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.545
I'm fine. I'm totally fine!

25:06.213 --> 25:07.756
Were you worried about me?

25:08.256 --> 25:09.925
You should go to the nurse's office.

25:10.008 --> 25:13.136
-It's nothing, really--
-Let's go.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.347
Okay.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.645
You don't have to do that,
I'll clean that up myself.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.605
You can have half of my lunch box.

25:23.688 --> 25:27.734
What? What? Wait, really?

25:32.447 --> 25:35.867
This is... boiled sweet potatoes!

25:36.868 --> 25:38.954
I didn't know you could cook.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.414
-You made all that yourself?
-Yup.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.916
That's incredible!

25:42.999 --> 25:44.751
My dad should learn
a thing or two from you.

25:44.834 --> 25:49.714
Look at that color, that shine!
I bet it's really salty.

25:49.798 --> 25:50.757
Don't complain.

25:51.675 --> 25:55.720
That was a compliment!
It tastes just like my mom's.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.890
You should have ignored those two.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.225
I agree.

26:00.517 --> 26:03.019
They can say whatever they want about me.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.565
But I won't let them
slander you like that.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.944
These boiled potatoes are amazing!

26:14.864 --> 26:16.741
-Hey!
-Muge, what are you doing?

26:19.661 --> 26:21.871
Hinode's boiled potatoes are...

26:22.205 --> 26:24.958
really salty!

26:27.210 --> 26:29.337
You should say it's delicious.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.006
"Really salty"?

26:31.089 --> 26:33.216
I see. Okay! Then...

26:33.300 --> 26:35.343
-Hinode's boiled potatoes are--
-Knock it off!

26:35.427 --> 26:37.470
You don't have to redo it!

26:37.554 --> 26:38.722
Why?

26:44.894 --> 26:47.439
His rice may be salty too, Muge.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.898
Shut up!

26:49.774 --> 26:52.485
<i>Did I just make Hinode laugh?</i>

26:53.320 --> 26:55.488
Don't go jumping off
buildings again, okay?

26:55.947 --> 26:57.198
You're not a cat.

27:00.493 --> 27:01.786
Ta-da!

27:02.829 --> 27:04.331
<i>She has the same scent.</i>

27:04.664 --> 27:07.917
Eat up, Hinode. Don't be shy. Open wide.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.210
It's my lunch box, okay?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.673
Miyo is my daughter, not yours.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.051
How can you be so cruel?
Stop hurting her.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.853
Hinode Sunrise Jump!

27:32.567 --> 27:33.735
The door is unlocked.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.112
There we go.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.075
Welcome home.

27:40.450 --> 27:41.409
Thanks.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.704
What happened to your leg? Are you hurt?

27:44.788 --> 27:48.208
Oh, this? It's just a scratch.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.960
-But...
-No, really!

27:51.044 --> 27:53.380
-I'll leave my lunch box in the sink!
-Okay.

27:54.464 --> 27:57.634
Onions? That means we're having...

27:57.717 --> 27:59.511
Curry? Or maybe meat and potatoes?

28:00.261 --> 28:03.014
Did something happen?
You seem to be in a good mood.

28:03.139 --> 28:06.101
Oh, no. Not at all!

28:14.859 --> 28:16.069
"Are you okay?"

28:21.700 --> 28:23.201
Hinode.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.840
Oh, man. I want to see him laugh again.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.514
Purr-fect landing.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.886
It looks like he isn't home yet.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.763
You can't be serious!

29:25.764 --> 29:30.769
We can't afford to keep the studio.
It's too expensive.

29:31.227 --> 29:34.689
At this rate, we won't be able to pay
Mr. Sakaguchi his salary.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.983
But Grandpa can still--

29:37.066 --> 29:40.987
Don't be selfish.
His eyesight is getting worse anyway.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.200
I wanted to continue, but she's right.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.451
Are you sure about this?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.621
I'm sorry, Kento.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.457
You should focus on your entrance exams.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.960
If you want to use the kiln,
you should do it soon.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.216
Hey. Are we really shutting down
the studio?

30:01.299 --> 30:02.133
Yes.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.719
-What about Mr. Sakaguchi?
-He'll be quitting.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.970
Are you serious?

30:06.471 --> 30:08.556
Listen, I have an idea!

30:08.640 --> 30:12.018
We should ask Mr. Sakaguchi
to start a pottery class.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.813
There are already too many
pottery classes in this town.

30:14.896 --> 30:15.897
That won't help.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.023
What?

30:17.106 --> 30:20.693
All the girls in town will be interested
if Mr. Sakaguchi's the instructor.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.987
-Well, I'll join the class too.
-Overruled.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.864
Oh, come on!

30:43.424 --> 30:44.801
<i>Hinode...</i>

30:50.598 --> 30:52.350
The sweet and sour pork is delicious.

30:52.976 --> 30:53.810
Really?

30:54.352 --> 30:58.231
Right? The onions make or break this dish.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.778
Why is it so good?

31:03.862 --> 31:05.738
It has a strong flavor,
the way you like it.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.907
I'm glad you like it.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.544
Hinode looked so sad.

31:20.169 --> 31:25.049
But I can't help him.
Not as Muge or as Taro.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.469
And the sweet and sour pork was good.
I hate this!

31:54.162 --> 31:55.163
Taro!

32:08.843 --> 32:11.262
Huh? Did you injure your leg?

32:13.681 --> 32:14.807
So you did.

32:16.517 --> 32:17.727
Are you okay?

32:20.229 --> 32:21.606
It's just like her injury.

32:28.655 --> 32:32.617
I wish I could speak my mind like her.

32:33.034 --> 32:39.248
I want to continue doing pottery.
I know the studio isn't doing so well.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.335
I want to tell them,
"I'll be in charge of the studio."

32:42.835 --> 32:46.756
But I'm not that confident myself...
So I didn't say anything.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.385
I don't know how Grandpa does it.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.722
In his hands, ordinary clay turns
into all kinds of shapes and colors.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.642
I've always wanted to be like him.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.852
But I couldn't say it...

33:05.191 --> 33:09.737
If Muge were in my shoes,
I know she would have said it.

33:10.446 --> 33:13.491
<i>Hinode. I'm just like you.</i>

33:14.367 --> 33:16.577
<i>I can't say the things I really want to.</i>

33:19.414 --> 33:21.207
You're amazing, Hinode!

33:22.000 --> 33:26.671
I used to wish the world would end,
every single day.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.091
But now... after meeting you...

33:30.717 --> 33:35.430
after falling in love with you,
the world seems so beautiful to me!

33:36.222 --> 33:39.934
<i>I... I want to help you.</i>

33:41.310 --> 33:43.104
I want to hear you say, "I love you."

33:54.532 --> 33:56.909
I have to study more pottery.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.787
There's nothing special
about my creations right now.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.416
I have to go to Tonomori High School.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.631
I have to tell Mom about my plans.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.135
Let's go, Taro.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.622
Did you tell him the truth?

34:42.914 --> 34:43.873
Of course not!

34:43.956 --> 34:48.252
I see. So, at this rate,
if you're never going to tell him,

34:48.336 --> 34:49.921
why don't you...

34:50.713 --> 34:52.548
stay a cat forever?

34:53.174 --> 34:57.762
No way! I can't do anything
for Hinode if I'm a cat.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.600
You can't help him as a human either.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.770
-That's not...
-It's not true?

35:07.772 --> 35:10.483
Are you sure about that?

35:10.942 --> 35:14.862
As a cat, you'll be able
to stay close to Hinode!

35:14.946 --> 35:18.991
You'll be able to observe him,
sleep, have him feed you, sleep,

35:19.075 --> 35:20.701
poop, sleep...

35:20.785 --> 35:23.162
Isn't that wonderful?

35:23.246 --> 35:25.248
Hinode will be happy too!

35:25.331 --> 35:27.291
Shut up! Shut up! Shut it!

35:36.884 --> 35:40.596
<i>The world is filled with things I hate</i>
<i>and things I don't need.</i>

35:42.056 --> 35:45.476
<i>But if there's nothing</i>
<i>when I step out of here,</i>

35:46.936 --> 35:48.688
I wouldn't want that.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.943
I wouldn't want that to happen.

35:57.363 --> 35:58.948
That tickles!

36:05.246 --> 36:06.080
All right.

36:19.927 --> 36:23.973
Something doesn't feel right.
Was Ms. Kaoru in my room?

36:28.895 --> 36:31.355
Her shoes are still here.
She must have gone out the window.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.107
At this hour? Without her shoes?

36:33.191 --> 36:36.152
-Oh, shoot.
-She's been sneaking out lately.

36:39.447 --> 36:42.408
What do we do? It doesn't feel right
for me to scold her.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.785
I know how you feel.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.081
Wait! What?

36:50.124 --> 36:50.958
Miyo?

36:54.712 --> 36:55.755
What is it?

36:55.838 --> 36:58.090
Miyo, did you go somewhere?

37:00.259 --> 37:04.096
I wanted to have tea together,
but you weren't in your room.

37:05.139 --> 37:09.644
-Well... I was up on the roof.
-What?

37:10.061 --> 37:13.689
Sometimes you just want to feel
the wind on your face, you know?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.025
Well, good night!

37:16.525 --> 37:17.485
-Night...
-Good night.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.492
Hinode Sunrise is...

37:24.575 --> 37:26.953
<i>I don't want empty words</i>
<i>to protect myself.</i>

37:27.453 --> 37:30.915
<i>I'd rather have Hinode's</i>
<i>scathing honesty instead.</i>

37:32.041 --> 37:33.376
No, that doesn't sound right.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.384
<i>Who needs Miyo Sasaki?</i>

37:42.051 --> 37:46.514
<i>Miyo Hinode...</i>
<i>Let's watch the sunrise together.</i>

37:58.526 --> 38:00.861
Did you stay up late to study?
That's so unlike you.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.780
I was thinking about my life.

38:03.572 --> 38:04.657
-Morning!
-Hey.

38:05.449 --> 38:06.284
-Morning.
-Hey.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.413
-Morning.
-Morning!

38:10.496 --> 38:12.206
-Morning.
-Morning!

38:14.834 --> 38:16.127
What is it?

38:22.383 --> 38:24.093
What's going on?

38:24.468 --> 38:26.512
-Hinode?
-What is it?

38:27.680 --> 38:29.807
This is for you!

38:29.890 --> 38:30.850
-What?
-What?

38:31.767 --> 38:32.643
TO KENTO HINODE

38:33.686 --> 38:37.523
Is that a letter I see, Miss Muge?

38:37.857 --> 38:39.275
It's none of your business!

38:42.361 --> 38:43.821
Is it a love letter?

38:43.904 --> 38:45.364
-Give it back!
-Niibori!

38:45.448 --> 38:46.282
-Got it!
-Muge!

38:46.782 --> 38:49.785
Miss Muge, Miss Muge! Over here!

38:51.287 --> 38:53.456
-Confession time!
-Knock it off!

38:53.956 --> 38:56.125
How about I read it out loud?

38:57.084 --> 38:59.503
Ta-da!

39:00.338 --> 39:03.883
-Cut it out, you two!
-Are you really going to read it, Bannai?

39:04.925 --> 39:07.219
She went all out! How pathetic can you be?

39:08.054 --> 39:13.059
"To Hinode.
I feel happy whenever I see you."

39:13.142 --> 39:17.730
-Bannai!
-"Hinode Sunrise isn't just a pun."

39:17.813 --> 39:19.023
Give it back!

39:19.774 --> 39:23.778
"It's how I feel about you.
You're my sunrise."

39:23.861 --> 39:26.655
-The letter isn't for you!
-Give it back!

39:26.739 --> 39:28.240
-Give it back!
-"Hinode Sunrise is

39:28.324 --> 39:30.618
when the sun rises above the horizon

39:30.701 --> 39:32.995
-and warms my soul."
-Stop it!

39:33.079 --> 39:34.205
Give it back!

39:35.206 --> 39:36.749
Why are you so desperate?

39:38.292 --> 39:40.252
Is this too embarrassing for you?

39:40.336 --> 39:45.591
Why should I be embarrassed?
Don't make fun of my feelings!

39:47.843 --> 39:52.056
Are you going to accept
her love confession?

39:52.390 --> 39:55.267
Mr. Sunrise?

39:58.020 --> 39:58.896
Hinode...

40:05.945 --> 40:06.821
What?

40:08.781 --> 40:09.657
Why?

40:11.659 --> 40:13.994
Confession time! Confession!

40:14.078 --> 40:15.037
Shut up!

40:15.871 --> 40:20.709
I just wanted you to cheer up.

40:20.793 --> 40:24.630
I'm just like you.
I can't say the things I truly feel.

40:24.922 --> 40:28.342
-So--
-I'm not like you!

40:30.386 --> 40:31.846
This is embarrassing for me.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.183
Have you considered my feelings?
He read it in front of everyone.

40:36.767 --> 40:40.020
I hate pushy people like you.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.732
But... what if I told you
in person instead--

40:43.816 --> 40:47.570
Just leave me alone!
Didn't you hear me? I hate you!

40:48.737 --> 40:50.739
You hate me?

40:52.491 --> 40:53.617
I really hate you.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.248
I see.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.046
You hate me that much, huh?

41:07.173 --> 41:08.090
Muge?

41:10.050 --> 41:12.052
That's too bad.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.514
Muge!

41:16.807 --> 41:17.683
Die!

41:22.980 --> 41:24.899
I told you to give up on him!

41:25.733 --> 41:28.986
I should be the one crying, you know.

41:29.695 --> 41:32.448
Give up on Hinode already.

41:32.531 --> 41:34.450
What? I can't.

41:34.533 --> 41:37.286
Give up on him,
or we're no longer friends.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.288
I don't want that either.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.127
-Yori?
-You're such an idiot!

41:50.883 --> 41:52.885
Miyo? Are you there?

41:53.802 --> 41:56.263
-I'm here.
-Would you like to have tea?

41:58.557 --> 41:59.975
I'll pass.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.269
Can I come in?

42:02.353 --> 42:04.188
What? One second!

42:07.525 --> 42:08.400
Okay, come in.

42:13.572 --> 42:17.201
I can't have tea,
I'm trying to lose weight.

42:18.661 --> 42:19.662
Miyo...

42:21.455 --> 42:23.832
Do I make you uncomfortable?

42:24.708 --> 42:27.545
What? That sounds like a soap opera!

42:27.628 --> 42:31.715
No, of course not. That's ridiculous!

42:31.799 --> 42:35.761
Why are you smiling like that?
You always do that.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.181
Are you forcing yourself
to be someone you're not?

42:39.807 --> 42:43.018
-Miyo, I...
-So selfish.

42:43.477 --> 42:44.853
What? Selfish...

42:45.187 --> 42:48.440
You're all so selfish! So self-centered!

42:49.900 --> 42:50.734
Miyo?

42:52.570 --> 42:55.364
So what if I'm forcing myself to smile?

42:56.031 --> 42:58.617
I do it because I want to!

42:59.159 --> 43:01.412
A stepmom? So?

43:01.495 --> 43:05.124
You and Dad already knew
I wouldn't be happy about this!

43:05.624 --> 43:09.712
But I'm doing my best
to live peacefully with you, aren't I?

43:09.795 --> 43:11.046
And now...

43:11.422 --> 43:13.841
you want me to stop smiling
if I don't mean it?

43:13.924 --> 43:16.468
-It's all about what you want, isn't it?
-Miyo!

43:18.178 --> 43:20.055
Don't get me started on Mom.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.975
She abandoned me and walked out!

43:23.976 --> 43:26.228
And now she says
she wants to live with me?

43:26.645 --> 43:30.524
I don't care about Mom, Dad, or you!

43:30.858 --> 43:32.443
I couldn't care less!

43:33.861 --> 43:35.529
I don't need any of you!

43:39.825 --> 43:41.076
-Miyo!
-Miyo!

43:42.202 --> 43:43.329
Wait!

43:43.579 --> 43:44.663
Come back!

43:49.251 --> 43:50.419
Miyo!

43:54.340 --> 43:55.758
I don't care anymore...

43:56.634 --> 44:00.721
Ms. Kaoru, Kinako, Dad, Mom...

44:01.972 --> 44:05.851
I don't care if they all hate me.

44:07.144 --> 44:09.563
Hinode is all I need.

44:24.244 --> 44:28.666
I'm such an idiot. Yori was right.

44:31.085 --> 44:34.213
He didn't mean anything
when he shared his lunch with me.

44:35.005 --> 44:37.216
But I got ahead of myself
and wrote him a letter.

44:38.592 --> 44:40.886
And now he says he hates me.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.181
Why?

44:44.682 --> 44:47.810
I want to hear him say, "I like you."

44:48.644 --> 44:51.021
I want to hear him say, "I love you."

45:00.030 --> 45:01.907
<i>Hinode Sunrise is</i>

45:01.990 --> 45:05.994
<i>when the sun rises above the horizon</i>
<i>and warms my soul.</i>

45:06.704 --> 45:09.873
<i>When I'm with you,</i>
<i>I feel warm and fuzzy inside.</i>

45:09.957 --> 45:11.875
<i>I know other people feel the same way too.</i>

45:12.334 --> 45:15.462
<i>Even if things don't go your way,</i>
<i>please don't blame yourself...</i>

45:15.713 --> 45:19.216
I'm just like you.
I can't say what I truly feel.

45:20.509 --> 45:23.846
Why did she say that?

45:24.388 --> 45:27.683
I never told her about my troubles.

45:31.103 --> 45:33.230
Isn't this a little late for you?

45:37.067 --> 45:39.820
Remember that plate you stepped on?
You left a paw print.

45:42.072 --> 45:45.409
That was genius. Grandpa was impressed.

45:47.536 --> 45:50.622
"I'm not like you..."

46:09.683 --> 46:10.934
The scent of the sun.

46:12.686 --> 46:13.896
Her scent.

46:15.856 --> 46:20.611
<i>She didn't seem like the type</i>
<i>to have trouble expressing herself.</i>

46:25.574 --> 46:27.326
Wait, what?

46:35.667 --> 46:36.710
I love you!

46:43.717 --> 46:45.260
Why didn't I see it?

46:47.805 --> 46:48.972
"I love you."

47:02.945 --> 47:07.574
<i>So if I was Taro, he'd love me?</i>

47:09.326 --> 47:11.078
<i>Hinode Sunrise.</i>

47:12.788 --> 47:17.417
<i>It was always my dream</i>
<i>to see the sunrise with Hinode.</i>

47:29.513 --> 47:30.848
<i>This is...</i>

47:32.224 --> 47:34.560
<i>Oh, right. This is Hinode's house.</i>

47:35.018 --> 47:39.565
<i>What? Oh, shoot! Look at the time!</i>
<i>I'm late for school!</i>

47:41.608 --> 47:44.194
<i>Oh, yeah. I'm a cat. I don't have to go.</i>

47:50.742 --> 47:51.660
Mask Seller!

47:51.743 --> 47:54.079
Everything's better when you're a cat!

47:54.162 --> 47:56.623
It's all sunshine and rainbows.

47:56.707 --> 48:00.544
I'm a cat, so you can take my word for it.
There's no doubt about it!

48:02.129 --> 48:03.046
I'm done.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.923
What do you mean?

48:05.382 --> 48:07.885
I'm done with being Miyo.

48:08.385 --> 48:12.014
Is that right? Good, very good.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.016
<i>I'm done.</i>

48:24.318 --> 48:26.486
-Thanks!
-What's that?

48:26.778 --> 48:28.447
Your human face.

48:28.614 --> 48:31.825
It comes off when you're sure
you don't want to be human anymore.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.702
You'll stay as a cat now.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.121
What? I can't go back to being human?

48:36.622 --> 48:39.082
You can.
If you put this mask back on, that is!

48:39.583 --> 48:42.753
But you have to do it
before you turn into a real cat.

48:43.086 --> 48:47.716
It'll take a little more time
to complete your transformation.

48:47.799 --> 48:51.345
When the time comes,
I'll take you to a wonderful place

48:51.428 --> 48:53.221
to commemorate the occasion.

48:54.389 --> 48:56.141
Wait, I'm not--

49:06.234 --> 49:08.195
Goodbye, Muge.

49:10.822 --> 49:12.574
Fukase, Hinode, come with me.

49:12.658 --> 49:14.576
PRINCIPAL'S RECEPTION ROOM

49:14.785 --> 49:15.869
She ran away from home?

49:16.411 --> 49:17.788
Do you know anything about it?

49:18.038 --> 49:19.039
No...

49:19.122 --> 49:21.625
-Are you Hinode?
-Yes.

49:22.459 --> 49:24.878
-Are you going out with Miyo?
-What?

49:25.212 --> 49:28.173
Miyo mentioned you once.

49:28.256 --> 49:30.676
Did she go to your place?

49:30.759 --> 49:33.428
-No...
-Please tell us the truth.

49:33.845 --> 49:34.888
We won't get angry.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.265
They're not a couple.

49:37.349 --> 49:41.269
But Miyo has been sneaking out
of her room every day...

49:41.353 --> 49:42.771
They're not a couple!

49:43.230 --> 49:45.524
I should know.
I walk home with Muge every day.

49:45.857 --> 49:49.945
If you know where she is, please tell us.

49:50.028 --> 49:52.447
If I knew, I...

49:53.407 --> 49:55.867
wouldn't be such a useless friend!

49:59.454 --> 50:00.706
If you'll excuse us...

50:00.789 --> 50:01.665
Thanks.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.381
What did they want? Is it about Muge?

50:09.631 --> 50:12.259
Yeah... She ran away from home.

50:12.342 --> 50:13.343
Really?

50:13.802 --> 50:16.555
Bannai and Niibori must have gotten
under her skin this time.

50:16.638 --> 50:17.723
I'm not so sure about that.

50:18.015 --> 50:21.184
She would never run away from home
because of losers like them.

50:21.643 --> 50:22.519
You think so?

50:23.603 --> 50:26.148
You've been her friend
since grade school, right?

50:26.773 --> 50:31.528
She's Miss Ultra Gaga and Enigmatic to us,
but not to you. You understand her.

50:32.988 --> 50:35.449
I'm going to look for Muge!

50:35.532 --> 50:36.950
-What, now?
-What?

50:37.034 --> 50:39.661
-Isami, tell the teachers--
-No!

50:39.745 --> 50:42.247
-Don't! I'll look for her alone!
-What are you--

50:42.831 --> 50:44.458
-You can't look for her!
-What?

50:45.333 --> 50:47.085
-Hey, what's going on?
-Wait! No!

50:47.169 --> 50:49.337
-Isami?
-I came to check on them!

50:49.421 --> 50:50.881
Okay, let's go back to class!

50:52.924 --> 50:56.053
<i>I see. I didn't know</i>
<i>about her family situation.</i>

50:56.803 --> 51:01.016
<i>Her mother walked out on her</i>
<i>when she was in grade school.</i>

51:01.099 --> 51:05.062
She was ostracized by
our classmates because of that.

51:05.312 --> 51:07.898
I was her close friend until then.

51:08.607 --> 51:11.151
But she didn't want them
to bully me, so...

51:11.443 --> 51:13.987
Yeah... I guess that happens.

51:14.488 --> 51:15.655
You guess?

51:16.865 --> 51:18.617
Yori!

51:19.618 --> 51:23.121
Yoriko's walking home with us. Right?

51:24.790 --> 51:27.918
She says she doesn't need you,
Miss Ultra Gaga and Enigmatic.

51:28.001 --> 51:31.797
-I bet your mom told you the same thing.
-Let's go, Yoriko.

51:32.672 --> 51:33.632
Okay...

51:49.815 --> 51:50.857
That hurt!

51:50.941 --> 51:52.818
Are you crazy? Why would you do that?

51:52.901 --> 51:54.444
I'll tell the teachers about this!

51:54.528 --> 51:55.737
This is bullying!

51:56.029 --> 51:59.866
I don't need you either!
I don't need Yori or my mom!

52:00.659 --> 52:03.912
I don't need you!
I don't need anyone! No one!

52:13.547 --> 52:15.173
Wait up!

52:17.676 --> 52:18.718
Muge, wait up!

52:19.344 --> 52:21.054
I need you, Muge!

52:21.721 --> 52:24.933
Maybe you don't need me, but I need you!

52:32.440 --> 52:33.608
Muge!

52:43.451 --> 52:45.203
Muge, I'm sorry!

52:48.707 --> 52:50.375
Muge, wait!

52:54.254 --> 52:57.716
I'm sorry! Muge!

52:58.133 --> 52:59.801
<i>That's when I realized that...</i>

53:00.635 --> 53:04.973
Muge always puts on a brave face.
She pretends she's all right...

53:05.849 --> 53:08.018
even when she's hurting inside.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.772
Hey, Hinode, did you mean it
when you told Muge you hate her?

53:12.856 --> 53:13.899
What?

53:14.191 --> 53:17.736
If you meant what you said,
I want you to ignore Muge.

53:18.445 --> 53:19.362
What?

53:19.446 --> 53:22.032
Don't get her hopes up.

53:23.116 --> 53:24.159
I...

53:24.242 --> 53:27.162
What? Wait! Don't say anything!

53:28.371 --> 53:32.459
I need to be sure.
Do you actually like Muge?

53:32.542 --> 53:36.129
If you do, she has to be the first
to hear it from you, not me.

53:38.840 --> 53:42.510
Well, I don't actually hate her.

53:45.305 --> 53:47.974
TOKONAME PUBLIC JUNIOR HIGH

53:57.442 --> 54:01.655
Her friend called Miyo "Muge."

54:02.072 --> 54:04.491
Yeah. It's her nickname.

54:04.574 --> 54:08.370
I had no idea. Does her mother know?

54:14.709 --> 54:16.795
-Oh, man...
-What's the matter?

54:17.504 --> 54:19.422
<i>She's coming over.</i>

54:21.758 --> 54:23.551
Wait, that's Mom's bike.

54:30.433 --> 54:33.770
I told you to get her a smartphone!

54:35.689 --> 54:38.733
Why did you go to her school?

54:38.817 --> 54:42.487
Have you thought about what
her classmates might say about you two?

54:42.904 --> 54:45.824
We figured her friends
might know something.

54:45.907 --> 54:51.913
You could have called her friends, then!
Don't you know who her friends are?

54:52.455 --> 54:53.331
I don't.

54:53.415 --> 54:54.791
You call yourself her father?

54:55.417 --> 54:58.169
She didn't go to your place, Ms. Miki?

54:58.545 --> 54:59.587
What are you implying?

55:00.171 --> 55:01.631
Miyo is--

55:01.715 --> 55:03.466
She can't be herself around you!

55:03.550 --> 55:07.137
She's too kind to be honest with you.
But what would you know about that?

55:07.220 --> 55:10.598
You forced yourself into her life
and into this family.

55:10.682 --> 55:12.017
You obviously wouldn't understand!

55:12.684 --> 55:16.646
That's my line. Did you
stop to think about her feelings

55:16.980 --> 55:17.897
when you abandoned her?

55:18.648 --> 55:19.482
Excuse me?

55:20.233 --> 55:22.569
Don't you know how much pain
you've caused her--

55:25.613 --> 55:27.741
-Hey, hey!
-What was that for?

55:27.824 --> 55:31.369
I want to be her mother again!
But you're just in the way!

55:31.453 --> 55:33.413
Hey, knock it off!

55:36.541 --> 55:39.210
-I just want Miyo to be--
-What the hell!

55:42.005 --> 55:44.799
<i>This isn't the best time to say goodbye...</i>

55:47.761 --> 55:48.803
Muge...

55:50.096 --> 55:51.264
Where are you?

56:06.029 --> 56:07.072
<i>Yori?</i>

56:09.366 --> 56:11.242
I looked all over for you, Fukase.

56:11.326 --> 56:12.786
I'm sorry.

56:12.869 --> 56:14.829
Did you find Sasaki?

56:14.954 --> 56:15.789
No...

56:15.872 --> 56:18.833
I see. We'll let her parents handle it.

56:18.917 --> 56:21.044
-Let's go back to school.
-Yes, sir.

56:21.586 --> 56:22.504
Where's Hinode?

56:22.879 --> 56:25.090
He went to the train station
to look for Miyo.

56:25.173 --> 56:28.176
<i>Wait, Hinode is looking for me?</i>

56:31.388 --> 56:32.555
<i>Really?</i>

56:33.973 --> 56:36.851
That's all we know.
I know you're worried about her,

56:36.935 --> 56:39.229
but please leave this to the adults.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.779
Kento should be back soon.

56:50.949 --> 56:54.285
You must really...

56:56.579 --> 56:58.873
<i>I didn't catch that, Grandpa.</i>

57:00.250 --> 57:02.210
<i>Could you repeat that?</i>

57:02.502 --> 57:05.755
Sorry, I don't know what to feed you.

57:06.714 --> 57:07.674
I'm home, Grandpa!

57:09.259 --> 57:10.260
Welcome back.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.762
Mom isn't back yet, right?

57:13.805 --> 57:14.722
Taro?

57:16.808 --> 57:18.685
I have to go out again.

57:18.768 --> 57:20.395
Could you make up an excuse to Mom for me?

57:20.478 --> 57:21.688
Sure.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.696
Maybe you'll be able to find her, Taro.

57:51.885 --> 57:53.136
Next, please.

57:54.345 --> 57:56.222
Where did she go?

57:57.182 --> 58:01.644
<i>Wait... Is everyone looking for me?</i>

58:14.741 --> 58:17.911
I didn't know anything about her.

58:19.078 --> 58:23.541
Where does she usually spend her time?
What does she like? What's on her mind?

58:25.418 --> 58:27.754
I had no idea what she was going through.

58:29.214 --> 58:34.344
She was always smiling and laughing
around me. She did it for me.

58:37.263 --> 58:41.726
Compared to me,
she's so strong and amazing.

58:43.144 --> 58:44.896
It's an expression of love!

58:46.064 --> 58:47.023
I see.

58:47.649 --> 58:52.612
I was afraid she would see me
for who I am, a nobody.

58:53.613 --> 58:54.489
<i>Hinode...</i>

58:56.115 --> 59:01.204
I have to apologize to her.
She'll come back, right?

59:01.913 --> 59:05.166
You're amazing, Hinode. I know you are.

59:06.084 --> 59:09.420
You care about your family.
You're loyal to your friends.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.589
You're gentle with animals.

59:12.799 --> 59:15.718
That's why... I love you!

59:16.803 --> 59:17.720
Muge...

59:18.137 --> 59:19.097
<i>Yes?</i>

59:19.430 --> 59:23.059
I should have been...

59:24.227 --> 59:25.353
<i>What?</i>

59:27.355 --> 59:30.900
Her letter... if only I had...

59:31.859 --> 59:34.737
<i>I don't understand what he's saying.</i>

59:36.030 --> 59:38.533
<i>So, I really am turning into a cat.</i>

59:41.452 --> 59:42.870
<i>I messed up.</i>

59:43.705 --> 59:49.127
<i>I should have told him to forget about me</i>
<i>before turning into a cat.</i>

59:51.504 --> 59:53.464
<i>I want to go back to being a human.</i>

59:58.344 --> 59:59.178
Morning!

59:59.596 --> 1:00:00.430
Morning.

1:00:07.687 --> 1:00:08.813
Hinode!

1:00:10.356 --> 1:00:11.566
Morning!

1:00:11.649 --> 1:00:12.900
Morning...

1:00:14.902 --> 1:00:17.363
It's been three days since she returned,

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:20.366
and she hasn't executed
a single Sunrise Attack.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:21.284
Yeah...

1:00:21.701 --> 1:00:23.870
Something's off about her...

1:00:24.329 --> 1:00:27.582
Is she still hurting over
that thing with the letter?

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:29.500
You apologized to her, right?

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:31.085
Yeah.

1:00:34.213 --> 1:00:37.634
Oh, my God, it's so cute!
Where did you come from?

1:00:38.051 --> 1:00:39.260
I've seen it around town.

1:00:39.802 --> 1:00:41.054
It's looking at us!

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:42.889
-Look at those eyes.
-Come here, kitty!

1:00:48.102 --> 1:00:50.188
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

1:00:51.105 --> 1:00:54.525
Add "ing" to a verb, and you get a gerund.

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:01.282
What does the first example say? Sasaki?

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:08.039
Let's see... "I hate dry rice."

1:01:08.122 --> 1:01:10.208
-What?
-I'm not too sure...

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:12.710
<i>They're laughing at her joke.</i>

1:01:14.295 --> 1:01:18.549
<i>I have to do something.</i>
<i>That fake Muge is actually...</i>

1:01:20.218 --> 1:01:21.761
Hey, Mask Seller!

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:25.306
Show yourself! Mask Seller!

1:01:28.226 --> 1:01:29.102
What?

1:01:40.071 --> 1:01:40.988
I'm home!

1:01:42.990 --> 1:01:47.161
Miyo? Yoji, Miyo's back!

1:01:47.453 --> 1:01:50.164
What? Miyo!

1:01:50.623 --> 1:01:54.544
You're back! Are you all right?
I was so worried!

1:01:54.627 --> 1:01:56.129
Did anyone try to hurt you?

1:01:57.171 --> 1:01:59.924
-You're soaked.
-I'm fine.

1:02:00.299 --> 1:02:02.260
You'll catch a cold.

1:02:02.343 --> 1:02:04.595
Here. I'll fill the bathtub.

1:02:06.389 --> 1:02:07.932
We'll eat once...

1:02:09.475 --> 1:02:11.310
Oh, my. I haven't...

1:02:17.233 --> 1:02:19.527
Thank. You.

1:02:30.246 --> 1:02:32.957
The feelings of others
are a mystery to us.

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:34.625
The best we can do is guess.

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:37.879
You shouldn't assume
you have someone figured out.

1:02:41.132 --> 1:02:42.091
See you.

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:44.260
Okay, bye!

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:47.889
What? Muge, wait up!

1:02:52.977 --> 1:02:56.981
I completely forgot we were
supposed to walk home together.

1:02:57.440 --> 1:02:58.775
Are you all right?

1:02:59.066 --> 1:03:00.318
Of course I am.

1:03:04.822 --> 1:03:08.910
Hey Hinode, I think I'll stay
at your house tonight.

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:09.869
What?

1:03:10.328 --> 1:03:11.579
What are you talking about?

1:03:11.662 --> 1:03:15.708
I'll go to your house, eat your food,
and then we'll sleep together.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:16.959
-What?
-Wait, what?

1:03:17.335 --> 1:03:18.294
Are you nuts?

1:03:18.669 --> 1:03:20.171
Is this some kind of prank?

1:03:20.838 --> 1:03:22.548
-I can't do that?
-Of course not!

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:24.258
What's wrong with you?

1:03:24.759 --> 1:03:26.594
I can't believe I was worried about you.

1:03:26.677 --> 1:03:27.720
Let's go, Isami.

1:03:28.429 --> 1:03:29.305
Muge...

1:03:29.388 --> 1:03:32.600
She really is
Miss Ultra Gaga and Enigmatic...

1:03:33.351 --> 1:03:36.020
I admire you for
being her friend for so long.

1:03:36.354 --> 1:03:38.272
-Thanks.
-Later!

1:03:38.773 --> 1:03:39.816
He rejected me.

1:03:40.191 --> 1:03:41.859
What did you expect?

1:03:42.068 --> 1:03:43.402
Oh, well.

1:03:48.074 --> 1:03:49.492
See you.

1:03:50.785 --> 1:03:51.619
Bye...

1:04:01.462 --> 1:04:02.630
Why, hello, little kitty.

1:04:03.005 --> 1:04:05.174
What? I can understand you!

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:08.261
Well, I'm still half-cat,
not yet fully human.

1:04:08.803 --> 1:04:10.805
You're Kinako, right?

1:04:10.888 --> 1:04:11.848
Bingo.

1:04:12.181 --> 1:04:13.474
Kinako, listen...

1:04:13.558 --> 1:04:16.018
I want to go back to being a human.

1:04:16.853 --> 1:04:18.229
Give me back my face, please!

1:04:19.939 --> 1:04:21.816
I can't understand what Hinode says!

1:04:22.191 --> 1:04:24.694
That's because you're turning
into a real cat.

1:04:25.027 --> 1:04:28.239
Don't worry.
I'll make your dream come true.

1:04:28.489 --> 1:04:29.907
I'll go out with Hinode.

1:04:30.241 --> 1:04:32.869
Wait, are you sure you're okay with that?

1:04:32.952 --> 1:04:33.786
Hey, Kinako!

1:04:34.954 --> 1:04:38.124
I prefer being a cat, to be honest.

1:04:38.207 --> 1:04:39.542
Then why did you...

1:04:39.625 --> 1:04:41.168
I did it for her.

1:04:41.252 --> 1:04:45.047
Who? You mean Ms. Kaoru?

1:04:46.007 --> 1:04:48.175
She gave me happiness.

1:04:48.885 --> 1:04:51.387
<i>I want to return the favor.</i>

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.641
<i>Humans can live a lot longer than cats.</i>

1:04:56.350 --> 1:04:58.352
<i>I'm almost at the end of my lifespan.</i>

1:05:00.521 --> 1:05:05.151
<i>I want Kaoru to be happy,</i>
<i>even when Kinako is gone.</i>

1:05:07.069 --> 1:05:11.532
You'll live your life as a cat.
I'll live your life.

1:05:12.199 --> 1:05:16.287
And I'll take your place
as Kaoru's daughter.

1:05:17.371 --> 1:05:20.124
No... No! No! No!

1:05:20.458 --> 1:05:21.751
I want to be with Hinode--

1:05:21.834 --> 1:05:23.794
It's too late for that.

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:26.213
The Mask Seller and I

1:05:26.297 --> 1:05:30.051
will each get half of your lifespan.
That's how it works.

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:34.847
No... How do I undo this?

1:05:35.222 --> 1:05:36.766
Where's the Mask Seller?

1:05:37.266 --> 1:05:39.060
He's usually on the other side.

1:05:39.769 --> 1:05:42.438
The other side? How do I get there?

1:05:43.189 --> 1:05:45.441
You should be able to see it
if you're a cat.

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:47.610
What's that? A path?

1:05:48.277 --> 1:05:50.529
If you can see it,
your transformation's almost complete.

1:05:50.613 --> 1:05:51.739
Wait!

1:05:52.657 --> 1:05:54.784
I can't wait for the festival!

1:05:54.867 --> 1:05:56.035
Festival?

1:06:17.723 --> 1:06:19.433
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS CAT?
NAME: KINAKO, AGE: 12

1:06:19.517 --> 1:06:21.102
I'm sorry, Kaoru...

1:06:41.872 --> 1:06:42.748
What's this?

1:06:43.624 --> 1:06:46.585
It's a cute Torii gate. Is it for cats?

1:06:49.839 --> 1:06:52.299
I want to go back to being Miyo.

1:06:53.217 --> 1:06:55.136
No, no. No can do.

1:06:56.220 --> 1:06:57.096
Mask Seller!

1:06:57.430 --> 1:07:00.891
Why go back to your miserable human life?

1:07:00.975 --> 1:07:05.229
Lick your butt like a good cat
and have Hinode take care of you.

1:07:05.312 --> 1:07:09.567
Where's "the other side"?
And what's this "festival"? What--

1:07:10.985 --> 1:07:13.988
I heard about it from Kinako!
Kinako took my face!

1:07:14.321 --> 1:07:20.786
On the day of the next summer festival,
you'll become a real cat.

1:07:21.746 --> 1:07:22.788
The summer festival?

1:07:34.216 --> 1:07:35.217
What?

1:07:36.218 --> 1:07:39.889
Wait! I... I...

1:07:40.181 --> 1:07:41.766
I want to go back to being a human!

1:07:42.349 --> 1:07:46.604
I want to tell Hinode
how I feel about him.

1:07:51.859 --> 1:07:53.861
You should be able to see it
if you're a cat.

1:07:59.867 --> 1:08:02.328
What?! What's that?

1:08:14.548 --> 1:08:15.674
What...

1:08:16.175 --> 1:08:17.134
What?

1:08:17.218 --> 1:08:19.887
What on earth is that?

1:08:23.516 --> 1:08:24.683
I have to go there.

1:09:03.264 --> 1:09:04.473
INCOMING CALL
YORIKO FUKASE

1:09:04.557 --> 1:09:06.225
How do I use this again?

1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:08.227
-This one?
<i>-Hello?</i>

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:10.146
Yes, hi!

1:09:10.229 --> 1:09:13.190
<i>-Are you used to using your phone yet?</i>
<i>-</i>No, not yet...

1:09:13.274 --> 1:09:17.778
<i>Which rock have you been living under?</i>
<i>Anyway, about the festival today...</i>

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:19.280
The festival...

1:09:19.363 --> 1:09:21.282
<i>Isami called me.</i>

1:09:21.365 --> 1:09:24.243
<i>He's inviting both of us to join him</i>
<i>and Hinode at the festival.</i>

1:09:24.660 --> 1:09:26.287
Festival, huh?

1:09:26.370 --> 1:09:27.538
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

1:09:28.831 --> 1:09:31.000
I think I'll go with Ms. Kaoru.

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:34.670
<i>What? Really? What about your mom?</i>

1:09:34.753 --> 1:09:36.213
She doesn't know my number yet.

1:09:36.755 --> 1:09:37.882
<i>I see...</i>

1:09:48.225 --> 1:09:50.060
Ms. Kaoru, are you all right?

1:09:52.146 --> 1:09:54.190
Miyo. Are you going out?

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:56.150
No.

1:09:56.650 --> 1:09:58.777
Kinako still hasn't come home.

1:09:58.861 --> 1:10:01.488
She's never done this before.

1:10:02.907 --> 1:10:04.867
I don't mind if she forgets me.

1:10:04.950 --> 1:10:07.745
I just hope someone else
is taking care of her.

1:10:09.455 --> 1:10:11.248
I'll go look for her.

1:10:18.005 --> 1:10:18.839
Kaoru!

1:10:22.384 --> 1:10:23.719
"Ms." Kaoru...

1:10:24.428 --> 1:10:27.264
Kinako... Kinako...

1:10:27.598 --> 1:10:29.642
would never forget you.

1:10:31.310 --> 1:10:35.147
Kinako is happiest when she's with you.

1:10:36.190 --> 1:10:38.150
She loves you.

1:10:38.984 --> 1:10:42.363
I hope so. Thanks.

1:10:44.406 --> 1:10:45.741
Kaoru...

1:10:48.577 --> 1:10:49.495
I see.

1:10:49.578 --> 1:10:50.913
<i>You should come anyway.</i>

1:10:50.996 --> 1:10:53.749
-I'll be there. See you later.
<i>-Later.</i>

1:10:54.917 --> 1:10:56.585
Hey, Kento.

1:10:56.669 --> 1:11:00.923
Let's go to the festival together.
You should invite Mr. Sakaguchi too.

1:11:01.507 --> 1:11:03.092
I'm going with my friend.

1:11:03.342 --> 1:11:05.594
Well, how about you invite
Mr. Sakaguchi anyway?

1:11:05.678 --> 1:11:08.097
And then you can tell him
you can't make it.

1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:09.348
Do it yourself.

1:11:09.723 --> 1:11:14.311
Seriously? Oh, well, I'll get Grandpa...

1:11:15.062 --> 1:11:16.897
Muge isn't joining us?

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:22.361
What are you doing?

1:11:22.695 --> 1:11:25.239
I need to ask you something.

1:11:25.322 --> 1:11:28.617
What is it?
Come in through the front door.

1:11:28.701 --> 1:11:30.744
How do you feel about me?

1:11:31.203 --> 1:11:33.872
-What? What do you mean?
-Do you like me?

1:11:33.956 --> 1:11:34.999
What?

1:11:35.749 --> 1:11:38.836
What are you talking about?
What's gotten into you lately?

1:11:39.503 --> 1:11:41.338
You'd never say that.

1:11:41.672 --> 1:11:44.174
I knew it. You saw through me.

1:11:44.258 --> 1:11:45.301
What?

1:11:45.718 --> 1:11:47.970
You know I'm not the real Muge.

1:11:49.972 --> 1:11:53.434
Would you stop teasing...

1:12:01.108 --> 1:12:02.401
What the--

1:12:05.612 --> 1:12:06.947
"What the--"

1:12:09.158 --> 1:12:12.703
Let me get this straight.
You don't want to be Muge anymore?

1:12:14.371 --> 1:12:15.998
I made a mistake.

1:12:16.081 --> 1:12:18.584
I can't replace Kinako as Muge.

1:12:19.126 --> 1:12:23.297
I underestimated
how much Kaoru loves Kinako.

1:12:25.341 --> 1:12:26.925
So Taro is Muge...

1:12:27.217 --> 1:12:29.470
That explains why
they both smell like the sun.

1:12:31.930 --> 1:12:32.806
I love you!

1:12:33.807 --> 1:12:35.726
I wish I'd known about this earlier.

1:12:36.185 --> 1:12:39.063
I feel sorry for her, though.

1:12:39.146 --> 1:12:42.441
Her mom is so irresponsible.
I don't blame her for wanting to be a cat.

1:12:43.901 --> 1:12:45.569
It must have been difficult for her.

1:12:45.861 --> 1:12:49.448
She can't imagine anyone ever loving her.

1:12:50.449 --> 1:12:51.784
Not even her own parents.

1:12:51.867 --> 1:12:55.412
So that's why you're the only one
who can save her.

1:12:55.829 --> 1:12:56.705
Please.

1:12:57.081 --> 1:12:59.083
Save her? Me?

1:12:59.958 --> 1:13:01.585
You can do it, Hinode.

1:13:01.877 --> 1:13:03.253
I feel like I'm being used.

1:13:07.591 --> 1:13:08.675
Cat Island?

1:13:08.759 --> 1:13:12.554
That's right.
The Sacred Tree will awaken today.

1:13:12.638 --> 1:13:15.140
Its power turns humans into cats
permanently.

1:13:15.766 --> 1:13:17.768
This is a lot to take in.

1:13:21.647 --> 1:13:23.732
-Give me your hand.
-Okay...

1:13:24.274 --> 1:13:26.110
Don't let go, okay?

1:13:31.156 --> 1:13:33.951
That's Cat Island
on the other side of this bridge.

1:13:34.159 --> 1:13:35.327
What bridge?

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:37.830
Don't worry, I can see it.

1:13:37.913 --> 1:13:39.998
What? What do you mean?

1:13:41.708 --> 1:13:42.876
Something's there.

1:13:45.754 --> 1:13:47.589
You'll fall if you let go of my hand.

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:53.804
You'd be able to see this bridge
if you were a cat.

1:13:53.887 --> 1:13:55.264
This is too much for me!

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:01.353
What's taking Hinode so long?

1:14:01.645 --> 1:14:02.604
Yeah...

1:14:02.688 --> 1:14:04.565
The festival can't go on
in this rain anyway.

1:14:04.648 --> 1:14:05.482
Yeah...

1:14:05.566 --> 1:14:08.610
-Do you want to go to a cafe instead?
-Wait, is that...

1:14:12.739 --> 1:14:13.782
It's Yori.

1:14:14.533 --> 1:14:15.534
Hello?

1:14:15.951 --> 1:14:17.661
<i>Muge, where are you now?</i>

1:14:17.744 --> 1:14:19.955
On a bridge, I guess?

1:14:20.038 --> 1:14:23.250
<i>What? I saw Ms. Kaoru.</i>

1:14:24.835 --> 1:14:28.213
<i>She was looking for her cat in the rain.</i>
<i>She didn't even have an umbrella.</i>

1:14:29.256 --> 1:14:30.090
I see.

1:14:30.966 --> 1:14:31.884
<i>Are you alone?</i>

1:14:32.301 --> 1:14:34.136
No, Hinode is with me.

1:14:34.219 --> 1:14:35.304
What?

1:14:36.388 --> 1:14:38.599
Wait, who invited whom?

1:14:38.932 --> 1:14:40.767
<i>I invited him, I guess.</i>

1:14:42.269 --> 1:14:45.564
Say no more!
Go for it! I'm rooting for you!

1:14:46.106 --> 1:14:49.443
<i>You have to tell me</i>
<i>all about it tomorrow, okay?</i>

1:14:50.694 --> 1:14:53.489
Yeah. Muge is so lucky.

1:14:53.572 --> 1:14:55.491
<i>What are you talking about...</i>

1:14:56.325 --> 1:14:57.784
Hey, slow down!

1:15:22.684 --> 1:15:24.228
<i>What is this place?</i>

1:15:24.311 --> 1:15:27.356
<i>Everyone's a cat, and the sun never rises.</i>

1:15:27.606 --> 1:15:30.234
<i>No time to wonder. I have to find him!</i>

1:15:31.318 --> 1:15:34.279
Excuse me,
I'm looking for the Mask Seller.

1:15:34.363 --> 1:15:36.573
Mask Seller? What's that?

1:15:36.657 --> 1:15:39.952
-Is it delicious?
-You should eat something before you go.

1:15:40.536 --> 1:15:42.329
Yeah! You'll like our menu!

1:15:42.412 --> 1:15:44.706
Our rats are fresh, you know!

1:15:45.374 --> 1:15:46.416
No, thanks.

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:48.752
Are you sure? It's really good.

1:15:56.969 --> 1:15:59.930
Somebody, anybody, please!
Where can I find the Mask Seller?

1:16:00.347 --> 1:16:02.057
Mask Seller!

1:16:02.391 --> 1:16:04.851
Mask Seller! Where are you?

1:16:05.519 --> 1:16:07.646
-Hey, Miss...
-Who, me?

1:16:08.188 --> 1:16:10.732
-You're half-human, aren't you?
-What?

1:16:11.024 --> 1:16:12.609
Your face was taken from you, huh?

1:16:13.151 --> 1:16:15.737
Do you know about the Mask Seller?

1:16:17.531 --> 1:16:18.907
Please tell me where he is!

1:16:19.783 --> 1:16:22.244
I have to see him.
I'll do whatever it takes!

1:16:26.456 --> 1:16:27.833
HUMAN-CAT BAR

1:16:28.542 --> 1:16:29.501
Come on in.

1:16:31.753 --> 1:16:33.880
We have a newcomer, you guys.

1:16:37.342 --> 1:16:38.218
I...

1:16:42.681 --> 1:16:46.226
So... this is Cat Island?

1:16:46.643 --> 1:16:50.397
And everyone in this bar used to be human?

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:51.565
That's right.

1:16:52.024 --> 1:16:54.443
You want to be a cat too?

1:16:54.526 --> 1:16:57.904
You must have had an awful time
as a human being!

1:16:57.988 --> 1:17:00.490
Humans are horrible, aren't they?

1:17:00.782 --> 1:17:02.868
Well, that's a little extreme.

1:17:03.201 --> 1:17:04.953
-Hey, you.
-Yes?

1:17:05.579 --> 1:17:07.873
If you want to go back to being a human,

1:17:08.206 --> 1:17:09.916
you should leave as soon as possible.

1:17:10.417 --> 1:17:13.920
But I can't talk to humans as a cat.

1:17:14.296 --> 1:17:17.341
I need to tell someone how I really feel.

1:17:17.799 --> 1:17:19.760
-So...
-Why are you still here then?

1:17:20.761 --> 1:17:24.598
Once the Mask Seller takes your lifespan,
you'll be stuck here forever.

1:17:24.681 --> 1:17:26.767
You won't be able to go back
to being a human.

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:29.269
That... would be a problem.

1:17:33.231 --> 1:17:35.275
-Is that a human?
-I haven't seen one in ages.

1:17:35.359 --> 1:17:37.361
-Brings back memories.
-Is he a cat-person?

1:17:39.071 --> 1:17:40.197
Watch your head.

1:17:41.281 --> 1:17:42.532
-Too late.
-Sorry.

1:17:44.618 --> 1:17:46.578
Excuse me!

1:17:49.247 --> 1:17:50.499
He isn't here.

1:17:59.841 --> 1:18:01.635
How about this one?

1:18:02.886 --> 1:18:04.513
All right, now do a somersault!

1:18:11.853 --> 1:18:13.855
What is this place?

1:18:14.356 --> 1:18:17.150
I can see my surroundings now.
That means I'm a cat--

1:18:19.695 --> 1:18:21.029
Only your hands? Why?

1:18:21.488 --> 1:18:22.322
How should I know?

1:18:27.077 --> 1:18:29.663
Welcome!

1:18:29.955 --> 1:18:33.625
You must be Hinode.

1:18:33.959 --> 1:18:36.002
-Mask Seller!
-"Mask Seller"?

1:18:36.461 --> 1:18:39.756
Hey, listen!
I want to return this face to Muge.

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:41.758
-So--
-What was that?

1:18:43.009 --> 1:18:47.556
You mean you don't want
your share of her lifespan?

1:18:48.098 --> 1:18:52.978
In that case, I'll take your share too.
No complaints, right?

1:18:53.061 --> 1:18:54.062
No, wait!

1:19:02.696 --> 1:19:05.574
I have a question.
Don't you regret turning into a cat?

1:19:06.783 --> 1:19:09.286
I do, but what's the point
of dwelling on it?

1:19:09.369 --> 1:19:10.912
It just makes it more depressing.

1:19:11.204 --> 1:19:12.581
We ran away.

1:19:13.498 --> 1:19:15.584
All of us here chose to run
from our problems.

1:19:15.959 --> 1:19:16.960
That's right.

1:19:17.043 --> 1:19:18.003
Take me, for example.

1:19:18.587 --> 1:19:22.174
I ran from my responsibilities
as a mother.

1:19:24.134 --> 1:19:27.304
I was having doubts. Was I giving
my children the love they deserved?

1:19:27.971 --> 1:19:31.516
I began to feel like they knew
I wasn't up to the task.

1:19:32.476 --> 1:19:33.351
So I ran away.

1:19:34.352 --> 1:19:39.357
Me too.
I didn't know how to love or be loved.

1:19:39.733 --> 1:19:43.904
My insecurities suffocated me,
and I had to escape.

1:19:44.946 --> 1:19:46.740
We've come to terms with our decisions.

1:19:47.157 --> 1:19:49.075
But you still have your life ahead of you.

1:19:49.284 --> 1:19:51.453
Tell your special someone
how you really feel.

1:19:51.536 --> 1:19:52.788
I know you can do it!

1:19:53.413 --> 1:19:55.332
-Thanks!
-Too bad, so sad!

1:19:55.415 --> 1:19:56.249
What?

1:20:02.631 --> 1:20:05.258
Hinode isn't in the human realm.

1:20:05.592 --> 1:20:09.471
-What?
-I locked him in my shop.

1:20:09.888 --> 1:20:12.390
What? You did that to Hinode? Why?

1:20:12.766 --> 1:20:15.852
He came here to look for you.

1:20:16.186 --> 1:20:18.313
What? You're lying.

1:20:18.939 --> 1:20:22.192
Hinode doesn't even know I'm Taro.

1:20:22.275 --> 1:20:25.779
The cat that has your face...
Kinako, was it?

1:20:25.862 --> 1:20:28.448
She was with him,
so he probably heard from her.

1:20:28.532 --> 1:20:29.783
Kinako was with him?

1:20:29.866 --> 1:20:31.409
Yes, siree!

1:20:31.993 --> 1:20:34.579
Why couldn't they wait a little longer?

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:37.290
You'll turn into a real cat soon enough.

1:20:39.835 --> 1:20:43.922
Hinode was looking for me? Why?

1:20:44.714 --> 1:20:46.508
We must not let them derail our plans.

1:20:46.842 --> 1:20:51.471
Let's hurry and get going
to the Promised Place now.

1:20:57.269 --> 1:20:58.186
Stop it.

1:20:59.563 --> 1:21:01.356
She's still a kid.

1:21:01.857 --> 1:21:05.443
Children have longer lifespans.
Much longer than you!

1:21:05.527 --> 1:21:07.070
I want her lifespan!

1:21:10.657 --> 1:21:12.409
We have to save this Hinode.

1:21:13.368 --> 1:21:14.911
Let's go to his shop.

1:21:15.287 --> 1:21:17.539
Yes. Thank you. All of you!

1:21:17.622 --> 1:21:19.374
-Hurry!
-Okay!

1:21:25.380 --> 1:21:28.133
Hinode is your special someone, right?

1:21:29.134 --> 1:21:31.845
-Yes.
-So he came for you.

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:36.766
-I'm not so sure about that.
-He must be very brave to come here.

1:21:47.193 --> 1:21:48.153
It won't budge.

1:21:48.612 --> 1:21:49.446
We're here.

1:21:52.073 --> 1:21:53.491
Is someone there?

1:21:58.246 --> 1:22:00.165
Open the door, please!

1:22:00.248 --> 1:22:02.000
-Hinode.
-Please!

1:22:09.424 --> 1:22:10.592
Thank you very--

1:22:14.304 --> 1:22:18.224
Taro! No, wait. You're Muge, right?

1:22:19.184 --> 1:22:21.478
I can understand what you're saying!

1:22:24.022 --> 1:22:25.231
Your hands...

1:22:25.315 --> 1:22:29.027
I put on a mask,
but it didn't turn me into a cat.

1:22:29.527 --> 1:22:30.362
Just my hands...

1:22:31.821 --> 1:22:34.115
That's so like you, Hinode.

1:22:34.574 --> 1:22:35.617
What does that mean?

1:22:36.451 --> 1:22:37.953
You can have your face back.

1:22:38.370 --> 1:22:39.245
Kinako!

1:22:39.746 --> 1:22:41.456
Go back to being Miyo Sasaki.

1:22:44.834 --> 1:22:45.669
Finally!

1:22:55.637 --> 1:22:56.471
What?

1:22:56.721 --> 1:22:57.555
Why?

1:23:05.563 --> 1:23:06.481
Muge!

1:23:08.108 --> 1:23:09.025
Wait!

1:23:10.235 --> 1:23:12.862
This is bad.
The Sacred Tree is about to wake up.

1:23:14.656 --> 1:23:15.949
-Let's go!
-Okay!

1:23:16.783 --> 1:23:18.576
-Wait! You run so fast!
-Hurry!

1:23:20.745 --> 1:23:23.289
-Come on, hurry up!
-I'm running as fast as I can!

1:23:25.125 --> 1:23:26.209
Thanks.

1:23:27.335 --> 1:23:30.338
Why didn't she turn back into a human?

1:23:30.755 --> 1:23:34.175
Deep down, she believes turning back
will only bring her pain and suffering.

1:23:36.219 --> 1:23:38.054
It's up to you now.

1:23:43.309 --> 1:23:46.604
At this rate, Hinode will turn
into a cat too.

1:23:46.688 --> 1:23:50.525
Or maybe a half-cat? Whatever!

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:52.402
I'm so happy!

1:23:56.614 --> 1:23:59.451
Hinode? Hinode!

1:24:04.914 --> 1:24:05.957
Muge!

1:24:06.458 --> 1:24:10.211
-Hinode! No! Not Hinode!
-Hey! Behave!

1:24:10.712 --> 1:24:12.338
Stop that!

1:24:12.964 --> 1:24:14.549
I have to go back to being a human!

1:24:16.885 --> 1:24:17.761
What?

1:24:23.266 --> 1:24:26.936
Hey! You have to
take better care of your life!

1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:30.356
It belongs to me now!

1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:32.859
Hey, hey! Come back here!

1:24:34.861 --> 1:24:36.362
What's going on?

1:24:40.075 --> 1:24:43.161
<i>Hinode shouldn't be here!</i>
<i>He has to go back!</i>

1:24:44.037 --> 1:24:48.124
<i>He said he wants to study pottery.</i>
<i>He wants to be like his grandpa!</i>

1:24:49.292 --> 1:24:50.210
Hinode! Over here!

1:24:54.214 --> 1:24:55.090
Muge!

1:24:56.841 --> 1:24:58.426
Muge!

1:24:59.344 --> 1:25:00.303
Hinode!

1:25:03.306 --> 1:25:06.518
Excuse me, is that going up?

1:25:06.893 --> 1:25:08.645
What? Oh, yes.

1:25:09.646 --> 1:25:10.772
Can I hitch a ride?

1:25:11.106 --> 1:25:12.190
Oh, sure thing!

1:25:14.192 --> 1:25:15.360
Is that going up?

1:25:15.443 --> 1:25:17.195
All clear!

1:25:17.612 --> 1:25:19.656
-Is that going up?
-Go!

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:25.286
Hinode!

1:25:30.083 --> 1:25:32.585
Hinode! No!

1:25:33.128 --> 1:25:34.879
Go back!

1:25:40.093 --> 1:25:41.052
-Seriously?
-What?

1:25:41.136 --> 1:25:42.720
Muge!

1:25:45.098 --> 1:25:45.932
Hinode!

1:25:49.978 --> 1:25:50.812
Hinode!

1:25:57.277 --> 1:25:58.570
You can do it, Hinode!

1:26:09.539 --> 1:26:10.707
Let's go home, Muge.

1:26:11.332 --> 1:26:12.375
I...

1:26:15.211 --> 1:26:16.421
Hinode, I--

1:26:20.216 --> 1:26:21.050
I'm sorry.

1:26:21.467 --> 1:26:23.219
Why are you apologizing?

1:26:24.888 --> 1:26:27.974
I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.

1:26:28.183 --> 1:26:30.476
I only realize who's been supporting me

1:26:30.768 --> 1:26:34.522
behind my back when they're gone.

1:26:35.148 --> 1:26:37.317
I've always been like this.

1:26:37.567 --> 1:26:38.443
I...

1:26:39.319 --> 1:26:43.239
I finally realized the truth
when I learned you were actually Taro.

1:26:44.866 --> 1:26:48.328
You cheer me up at school.
It was always you.

1:26:48.786 --> 1:26:51.998
Wait, really? Do you mean that, Hinode?

1:26:52.498 --> 1:26:55.793
And that's why I have to change! I--

1:26:58.213 --> 1:27:00.840
You should stay the way you are.

1:27:01.549 --> 1:27:02.467
Mask Seller!

1:27:03.218 --> 1:27:05.845
I'll take your lifespan too...

1:27:06.888 --> 1:27:09.599
-as compensation.
-Let go of him!

1:27:32.247 --> 1:27:35.333
Welcome to the Promised Place.

1:27:38.836 --> 1:27:41.547
There's no way out for you.

1:27:41.631 --> 1:27:45.051
The two of you will turn into a cat
and a half-cat soon enough.

1:27:45.134 --> 1:27:46.886
Your lifespans are mine!

1:27:48.554 --> 1:27:51.849
<i>Just a little more! Just a little more!</i>

1:27:54.060 --> 1:27:58.314
<i>Your lives are mine! I'm a happy cat!</i>

1:27:58.815 --> 1:28:02.068
<i>Cats are always happy forever and ever!</i>

1:28:27.802 --> 1:28:29.304
If we get out of here...

1:28:30.346 --> 1:28:32.015
and find the whole world gone...

1:28:33.057 --> 1:28:33.891
No...

1:28:34.726 --> 1:28:36.894
I don't care either way.

1:28:38.396 --> 1:28:40.398
I don't want you to disappear, Muge.

1:28:41.899 --> 1:28:42.900
Me too!

1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:46.863
I don't want you to disappear, Hinode.

1:28:54.287 --> 1:28:56.873
What?! That hurts!

1:28:56.956 --> 1:29:00.084
-Ow, ow, ow! No! You--
-Turn Muge back to normal!

1:29:00.168 --> 1:29:01.836
-How do we undo this?
-Hinode!

1:29:01.919 --> 1:29:05.256
-Tell me!
-She doesn't want to turn back!

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:10.261
-I want to turn back!
-Your face doesn't want to go back!

1:29:10.970 --> 1:29:13.306
Even if you become human again,
nothing will change!

1:29:13.389 --> 1:29:14.640
That's not true!

1:29:14.974 --> 1:29:17.018
Once we turn back, we'll...

1:29:17.643 --> 1:29:19.228
We'll do better!

1:29:19.437 --> 1:29:21.731
Yeah! We'll do better!

1:29:30.323 --> 1:29:32.617
The Sacred Tree has awakened!

1:29:38.498 --> 1:29:41.667
-My body...
-What's happening...

1:29:46.964 --> 1:29:49.175
If you'll excuse me...

1:29:53.805 --> 1:29:57.642
-What?
-Very nice!

1:29:57.725 --> 1:29:59.894
-I'll take yours next and--
-Stop it!

1:30:02.063 --> 1:30:04.649
No! My lifespan!

1:30:04.732 --> 1:30:07.860
Wait! Hold on! Wait, wait!

1:30:08.820 --> 1:30:11.781
-Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait!
-I'm taking Muge with me!

1:30:13.741 --> 1:30:15.034
How can you do this to her?

1:30:15.118 --> 1:30:16.786
She didn't do anything wrong!

1:30:16.869 --> 1:30:20.248
-Come come!
-It isn't her fault she's in so much pain!

1:30:25.461 --> 1:30:26.337
No...

1:30:29.298 --> 1:30:30.633
<i>This is all my fault!</i>

1:30:32.135 --> 1:30:35.596
I have to do something,
or I'll regret this!

1:30:36.305 --> 1:30:38.099
I want to return his feelings!

1:30:45.231 --> 1:30:46.649
Not just Hinode!

1:30:47.984 --> 1:30:52.321
Ms. Kaoru, Dad, Mom...

1:30:53.281 --> 1:30:54.198
I...

1:30:55.450 --> 1:30:57.452
I never told them how I truly felt!

1:30:57.535 --> 1:30:59.370
-Give it up already!
-I...

1:30:59.704 --> 1:31:01.831
I hate this place!

1:31:02.248 --> 1:31:05.668
I want to go back! Let me go back!

1:31:13.176 --> 1:31:18.556
-We... have to go back!
-Hinode!

1:31:18.639 --> 1:31:22.310
Behave, or I'll tear you to pieces!

1:31:26.022 --> 1:31:26.939
What?

1:31:27.482 --> 1:31:29.567
I told you not to mess with them.

1:31:33.571 --> 1:31:34.697
You!

1:31:35.490 --> 1:31:36.324
Get him.

1:31:43.748 --> 1:31:47.335
No! Stop!

1:31:53.299 --> 1:31:54.300
Sorry we took so long.

1:31:54.759 --> 1:31:55.843
Thank you...

1:31:56.844 --> 1:31:59.305
They saved us.

1:32:35.675 --> 1:32:37.176
-Muge...
-Hinode!

1:32:38.719 --> 1:32:41.931
I want to know more about you.

1:32:43.266 --> 1:32:44.225
Hinode...

1:32:44.809 --> 1:32:47.019
Your Hinode Sunrise Attack, for example.

1:32:47.562 --> 1:32:50.439
<i>You do the craziest things.</i>

1:32:51.274 --> 1:32:53.109
But I want to see every side of you.

1:32:53.568 --> 1:32:56.487
Not just your smiling face.
I want to see your angry face.

1:32:56.571 --> 1:32:58.406
And your face when you act
like a spoiled child.

1:32:59.740 --> 1:33:03.911
Are you sure? How can you love me
if you see me at my worst?

1:33:04.370 --> 1:33:06.956
And I want to tell you, the human you...

1:33:07.373 --> 1:33:09.125
<i>that I love you.</i>

1:33:09.542 --> 1:33:12.753
<i>I want to see you smile again.</i>

1:33:14.255 --> 1:33:15.464
Me too.

1:33:16.090 --> 1:33:18.175
I want to see you laugh
like a child again.

1:33:19.844 --> 1:33:21.220
I want to tell you...

1:33:21.804 --> 1:33:23.723
that I love you.

1:33:24.015 --> 1:33:26.892
I don't want to wait to be loved.
I want to tell you how I feel.

1:33:27.893 --> 1:33:30.229
So, let's go back... together.

1:33:30.980 --> 1:33:32.315
Back to where we belong!

1:33:33.816 --> 1:33:38.195
You should go home too.
Treasure your owner.

1:33:38.946 --> 1:33:41.991
I will. All right, let's go!

1:33:42.074 --> 1:33:43.034
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1:33:49.248 --> 1:33:51.042
Thank you for everything!

1:33:52.209 --> 1:33:53.628
Thanks for everything!

1:33:54.754 --> 1:33:56.464
Goodbye!

1:33:56.547 --> 1:33:57.548
Take care.

1:34:03.262 --> 1:34:06.265
Hinode, Kinako, thank you.

1:34:06.766 --> 1:34:09.101
I made you both worry so much.

1:34:09.518 --> 1:34:11.145
It's not just us.

1:34:11.896 --> 1:34:14.565
Fukase and Isami were worried
when they heard you ran away.

1:34:14.649 --> 1:34:18.027
Bannai and Niibori too.
They tried not to let it show, though.

1:34:19.487 --> 1:34:22.156
Your parents were worried sick.

1:34:22.531 --> 1:34:26.327
You may not know it,
but a lot of people care about you.

1:34:29.830 --> 1:34:33.626
I shut my heart to everyone.

1:34:34.210 --> 1:34:37.380
Ms. Kaoru, Dad, Mom...

1:34:38.506 --> 1:34:41.759
I told myself I didn't need them. They
were just scarecrows in the background.

1:34:47.765 --> 1:34:51.477
But now... I know I was wrong.

1:34:52.353 --> 1:34:54.730
I'll try to like them too.

1:35:26.887 --> 1:35:28.597
I'm human again!

1:35:30.891 --> 1:35:32.393
Me too!

1:35:38.023 --> 1:35:41.068
I hope everyone on the other side
can be happy too.

1:35:41.318 --> 1:35:42.153
Yeah.

1:36:11.015 --> 1:36:13.100
<i>Muge... I love you.</i>

1:36:13.976 --> 1:36:17.062
<i>Me too. I love you so much, Hinode!</i>

1:36:21.233 --> 1:36:22.943
I'm home.

1:36:24.528 --> 1:36:26.238
Welcome--

1:36:26.697 --> 1:36:27.782
Kinako!

1:36:28.532 --> 1:36:30.367
I'm so glad you're back!

1:36:34.914 --> 1:36:38.459
Kinako likes me now.

1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:41.295
Oh, come on...

1:36:48.052 --> 1:36:49.386
I...

1:36:49.929 --> 1:36:51.555
I want to be a potter.

1:36:57.311 --> 1:37:00.189
I guess the kiln won't be
going into the shed.

1:37:03.067 --> 1:37:04.109
Thanks.

1:37:06.612 --> 1:37:08.239
Whatever...

1:37:09.657 --> 1:37:11.158
I love you...

1:37:11.700 --> 1:37:13.244
Oh, but I...

1:37:13.953 --> 1:37:16.247
I'm engaged...

1:37:17.915 --> 1:37:19.458
Sorry...

1:37:21.168 --> 1:37:23.796
Oh, man...

1:37:25.714 --> 1:37:28.175
Hold it!

1:37:31.095 --> 1:37:33.556
You held hands?

1:37:37.852 --> 1:37:40.813
You told him you love him!?

1:37:45.818 --> 1:37:48.779
He loves you too!?

1:37:49.572 --> 1:37:51.574
I'm so happy for you!

1:37:53.033 --> 1:37:54.577
Thanks.

1:38:09.967 --> 1:38:12.219
See you!

1:38:12.928 --> 1:38:14.346
See you...

1:38:26.233 --> 1:38:27.401
Morning!

1:38:29.069 --> 1:38:30.237
-Morning...
-Morning...

1:38:30.905 --> 1:38:32.239
Have a good day!

1:38:34.450 --> 1:38:35.409
Hey...

1:38:36.911 --> 1:38:37.828
Hey...

1:38:39.622 --> 1:38:40.581
What is it?

1:38:40.664 --> 1:38:41.832
Oh, nothing.

1:38:41.916 --> 1:38:43.459
Stop staring!

1:38:43.542 --> 1:38:45.294
Don't mind me.

1:38:47.963 --> 1:38:50.299
There's nothing between us, okay?

1:38:50.591 --> 1:38:51.425
If you say so.

1:38:51.508 --> 1:38:53.052
No, really!

1:38:53.135 --> 1:38:54.386
If you say so.

1:39:02.144 --> 1:39:04.605
Hinode Sunrise...

1:39:05.272 --> 1:39:06.607
Attack!

1:43:46.637 --> 1:43:49.348
THE END

1:43:49.431 --> 1:43:51.141
<i>Hinode Sunrise is when</i>

1:43:51.516 --> 1:43:55.604
<i>the sun rises above the horizon</i>
<i>and warms my soul.</i>

1:44:16.416 --> 1:44:20.879
