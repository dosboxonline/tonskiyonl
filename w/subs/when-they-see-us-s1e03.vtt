00:52.093 --> 00:54.637
I want you all to know my wish.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.475
My wish is for my grandson, Raymond Jr.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.811
It's hard for me to celebrate

01:02.228 --> 01:04.856
when I don't have all of my family here.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.275
He is in trouble,

01:07.525 --> 01:09.444
and no one wants to help him.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.238
I wanted to help him.
But I couldn't.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.326
I couldn't help him.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.455
You see what this is doing to everybody?

01:20.538 --> 01:23.333
-You see what this is doing to her?
-What am I supposed to do?

01:24.125 --> 01:25.126
Huh?

01:25.543 --> 01:28.630
This is the life you and him put her in.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.341
You should've never taken her
to that police station.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.260
You should've never let her go with you
to the courts.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.929
She ain't never been the same since.

01:36.012 --> 01:39.307
Okay, you tell me what I'm supposed to do,
all right, and I'll do it.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.893
-'Cause I done the best I could.
-Yeah, well,

01:42.060 --> 01:44.312
look what your best has gotten everybody.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.650
Everybody getting trouble from everywhere
in this family.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.570
How could a rapist be in our family?

01:52.654 --> 01:55.031
-He's not a rapist. Don't say that.
-That's what they say.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.741
That's what we have to hear all the time.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.368
Don't say that shit,
because you know what?

01:58.451 --> 02:00.578
He just went to the park
with some friends, okay?

02:00.662 --> 02:03.623
Just went to the park
because I told him to fucking go.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.375
I said "There's too much trouble
on the corner,

02:05.458 --> 02:07.085
so why don't you go to the park?"

02:07.168 --> 02:10.296
He just...
I sent him, I fucking sent him.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.340
He just did what I told him
'cause he's a good boy.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.051
Come on. You've known him all your life,
man. He's a good kid.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.220
He'd have never hurt nobody.

02:18.054 --> 02:18.930
Hey...

02:20.431 --> 02:23.393
Ma. We're just... We're just talking, Ma.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.320
I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna get a cigarette, okay?

02:36.614 --> 02:37.448
Later.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.414
- Baby.
-Yeah, Mama?

02:44.914 --> 02:46.791
You gonna help me get him ready
or what?

02:46.875 --> 02:51.171
Yeah. You got plenty of time,
though. I mean, can I just get a minute?

02:51.254 --> 02:53.131
I'm waiting for Ray. Ray's gonna call.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.758
Ray's always calling. The bill.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.844
The bill.
Baby, don't worry about the bill, okay?

02:57.927 --> 03:00.013
But you don't pay the bill,
so don't worry about it.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.015
I <i>do </i>worry about the bill, actually.
Okay? 'Cause it takes food
out of our son's mouth.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.435
-Don't start, please.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.312
-Look.
- Oh, I didn't do that.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.022
-You didn't do that?
- You're blaming me.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.481
-You didn't do that.
-All right.
-Okay, give me the baby.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.651
- No.
-I'll take the baby.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.153
- Forget it.
-I'll take the baby.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.613
The phone's ringing.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.035

<i>Is everything all right over there?</i>

03:34.797 --> 03:38.009
<i>-How long did you wait for the phone?</i>
-Yeah, a 45-minute wait today.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.220
<i>-Ow! Forty-five, wow.</i>
-Crazy, huh?

03:40.303 --> 03:42.055
So, what'd you have for dinner?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.723
<i>Ate off the commissary, thanks to you.</i>

03:43.973 --> 03:45.141
Cup Noodles.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.060
-<i>It was good as ever.</i>

03:47.268 --> 03:49.312
That's good, my man. Good. That's good.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.440
Look, thank you for that money.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.235

Yeah, yeah.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.910
I'm in my bunk...

06:11.537 --> 06:14.999
and I keep hearing these...
these footsteps.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.214
And they keep coming closer and closer.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.803
I don't know if I'm dreaming or...

06:28.679 --> 06:31.140
or if it's real. I...

06:37.355 --> 06:39.857
Every night, they just keep coming
closer and closer.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.079
You keep listening
for those footsteps, baby.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.541
That's <i>me...</i>

06:58.793 --> 07:00.586
coming to bring you home.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.061
I feel like everybody in the world
hate me, Ma.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.604
I know it feels like that.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.481
I know it feels like that.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.067
But I love you enough

07:23.901 --> 07:26.654
to make up for everybody.

07:29.198 --> 07:32.076
All I do all day...

07:33.327 --> 07:35.371

<i>Don't ever think you're alone.</i>

07:43.546 --> 07:46.674
<i>I'm walking through this with you.</i>

<i>You cry, I cry.</i>

Hi, Mama.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.734
Here, give me that.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.611
Give me your coat.
He here?

10:00.516 --> 10:01.517
Bobby.

10:04.895 --> 10:05.730
Bobby.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.693
-Baby, look who's home.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.658
Hey...

10:18.909 --> 10:19.785
Hey.

10:23.914 --> 10:24.915
Hey, son.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.251
Welcome home.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.921
Hey... Hey... Hey...

10:33.424 --> 10:34.508
Hey...

10:44.727 --> 10:46.145
<i>How you explain that?</i>

10:46.520 --> 10:48.689
<i>He called one day to check on us.</i>

10:51.817 --> 10:53.235
<i>But he didn't sound good.</i>

10:54.153 --> 10:57.448
<i>I asked him how he was doing.</i>
<i>He said, "Fine," but I know him.</i>

10:57.531 --> 10:59.533
<i>I know every part of his voice,</i>

10:59.909 --> 11:01.952
<i>and I know everything it means.</i>

11:02.495 --> 11:03.913
<i>Even when he doesn't know.</i>

11:05.289 --> 11:06.791
<i>I knew he wasn't fine.</i>

11:11.253 --> 11:12.797
<i>So I asked him to come over.</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:17.885
<i>So I could see how he was for myself.</i>

11:22.598 --> 11:23.557
<i>And he did.</i>

11:28.396 --> 11:30.022
He didn't get back till...

11:31.315 --> 11:32.316
two years ago.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.443
Before that, he was trying to work,

11:34.735 --> 11:36.195
he was still part-time.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.447
But when they set the dialysis up,

11:39.824 --> 11:40.991
the job let him go.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.705
How come he breathe like that?

11:46.455 --> 11:48.541
Water stays around his heart somehow.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.626
The kidneys not working.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.922
He just gonna stay like this then?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.720
He asking a lot of you, Ma.

12:00.928 --> 12:01.762
Well...

12:03.389 --> 12:05.349
it'll be easier now that you're here.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.353
I'll take care of you.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.480
I want to.

12:16.819 --> 12:17.653
But...

12:19.238 --> 12:20.614
I ain't taking care of him.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.077
If I had my way,

12:25.828 --> 12:27.329
you wouldn't have took him back.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.046
When you marry somebody...

12:38.674 --> 12:44.096
you promise to take care of them
in sickness and in health.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.600
-That was in our vows, Tron.
-The man walked out on you.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.437
-That's in the vows too?
-Bobby came back to me.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.980
When he needed something, Ma.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.775
Everybody made their decision.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.154
I made the wrong one
to listen to him at the precinct.

13:01.489 --> 13:05.409
He made the wrong one to leave us.
You making the wrong one right now.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.996
We all made bad decisions. So, what now?
What, I'm gonna hold it against you?

13:12.291 --> 13:15.878
You gonna hold it against me?
We gonna hold it against him? Forever?

13:15.961 --> 13:17.046
There's differences.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.384
You and me, we did things out of love.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.136
And we both believed him.
Me then and you now.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.685
But, Ma, him walking out on us,
that ain't love.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.021
That ain't love, Ma.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.734
Not then and not now.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.375
Aw! You like Papa's nose.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.503
<i>You have received a call from an inmate</i>

14:10.641 --> 14:14.353
It's all good. Trying to, like,
keep my head down, you know?

14:15.271 --> 14:17.481
-How's there?
<i>-Hold on, let me put your brother down.</i>

14:17.565 --> 14:19.567
- <i>Awww!</i>

Awww!

14:21.819 --> 14:23.988
It's kind of quiet here today
on the block.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.322
-Kind of quiet.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.825
Hey! Better than last week, though.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.702
Oh, man, the city was going crazy.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.120
Couldn't even sleep.
<i>That's crazy.</i>

14:33.122 --> 14:35.207
-Ain't nothing changed there then, huh?
<i>-Nope.</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:36.500
<i>How's it over there, though?</i>

14:36.584 --> 14:38.544

14:41.881 --> 14:46.468
<i>Well, tonight we got some TV dinners,</i>
<i>'cause Elena's trying to lose some weight.</i>

14:46.552 --> 14:49.638
<i>So now I gotta eat these... Lean Cuisines.</i>

14:51.015 --> 14:52.099
What's Lean Cuisines?

14:52.182 --> 14:55.477
<i>Yo, it's some shit no grown man</i>
<i>should be eating, let me tell you.</i>

14:56.020 --> 14:58.188
-It sounds like it.
<i>-Doesn't it, though?</i>

14:59.481 --> 15:01.525
But I... I'd take it right about now.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.905
Yeah. Yeah, I bet, I bet.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.115
Um, what about you, son?

15:08.198 --> 15:10.659
Um, what'd you have for dinner?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.870
Well, you know they feed us, but...

15:13.495 --> 15:16.165
you know, I stay hungry,
so I take anything I can get.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.833
<i>Yeah, like father, like son, huh?</i>

15:17.917 --> 15:21.670
But tonight's my kind of night.
You know, it's mac and cheese night.

15:21.879 --> 15:24.006
Little fried bologna,
know what I'm saying?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.466
<i>Fried bologna?</i>

15:25.549 --> 15:27.760
<i>Hey, look at you, big spender.</i>

15:27.843 --> 15:28.844
Yeah.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.139
But sometimes I feel like meat, so...

15:33.641 --> 15:34.934
I'll splurge a little.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.770
<i>Yeah, well, you know,</i>
<i>you're taking care of yourself</i>

15:37.853 --> 15:39.271

I want you to meet my wife Elena.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.375
Okay?

17:23.459 --> 17:24.626
Look, Elena.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.087
Come. I want to introduce you to my son.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.843
-This is my wife, Elena.
-Hi.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.679
<i>-Elena, este es Raymond.</i>
- Nice to meet you.

17:36.638 --> 17:37.514
You too.

17:40.642 --> 17:41.602
But what...

17:43.062 --> 17:44.480
-What?
-What's that?

17:44.563 --> 17:45.773
What are you talking about?

17:46.356 --> 17:47.483
Nothing, nothing.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.154
Who are all these kids?

17:52.404 --> 17:55.324
Elena's cousins. She takes everybody in.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.326
She's got a big heart.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.539
Ow!

18:02.623 --> 18:04.541
I'm gonna go put this in my room.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.473
Oh, yeah, don't worry
about all that stuff in there.

18:19.556 --> 18:20.682
We're gonna move it out.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.393
Things have changed.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.647
Yeah, I know, I know.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.359
Elena wanted to change it up,
you know, for the baby.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.112
Okay.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.033
Hey, Lena, Lena.

18:38.742 --> 18:39.576
How about...

18:39.660 --> 18:41.161
Two beers, please.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.621
There is no beer.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.623
What do you mean?
I gave you the money yesterday.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.749
I had to buy food.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.962
-You want water?
- I'll take water.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.798
Ramón! Ramón, come here!

18:52.881 --> 18:54.174
Papi's calling you.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.260
<i>Ramóncito! </i>Come here!

19:00.681 --> 19:01.640
Huh?

19:01.890 --> 19:03.892
I want you to meet your big brother.
All right?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.894
Say hi to your big brother.
This is Raymond.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.437
<i>-Hola.</i>
<i>-Hola.</i>

19:07.521 --> 19:09.356
I've been telling you
about Raymond.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.941
What'd I tell you about Raymond?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.111
<i>Gracias, mamalita.</i>

19:15.362 --> 19:16.280
Thank you.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.703
-He needs to eat.
-But he wants to be with me.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.384
Okay, man, let's just put
Ramón's stuff in my room, okay?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.598
Just put it on the bed.
Just be careful with the sheets.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.766
- That's the mom, right?
- Yeah.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.978
-They don't live here, though, right?
-Nah.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.063
She helps with Ramón, that's all.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.149
-Okay.
-Hey, wait.

19:52.399 --> 19:57.029
Uh, you know what? Why don't you take this
into the living room, all right?

19:57.154 --> 19:57.988
Gotcha.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.198
Put it anywhere.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.575
Ray?

20:02.075 --> 20:05.662
I wish you'd talk to me
before doing things in my room.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.708
- I didn't want to bother you.
- Well, talk to me.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.627
Okay, I will.

20:11.793 --> 20:12.628
Pop?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.714
Your wife knew
I'd be coming back here, right?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.257
Yeah, <i>por supuesto.</i>

20:17.341 --> 20:19.134
Of course. Why?

20:19.676 --> 20:21.845
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.723
I got a little something for you.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.562
That's for you.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.323
Tron, you hungry?

22:13.206 --> 22:14.082
Hey.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.424
Hey.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.551
I made us some lunch.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.639
Was hoping we could, uh... we could talk.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.237
Here.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.086
Maybe after your workout, then.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.491
-Want y'all at the rally at 10:00.
-Come on.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.452
- Hey, Deloris!
- Where is this?

23:32.536 --> 23:34.204
- Right out here.
- I see.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.957
Come to the rally at 10:00, y'all.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.834
-You hanging in there?
- Ten o'clock.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.210
I'm doing the best I can.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.255
Sharonne.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.174
How you been, Deloris?

23:48.385 --> 23:49.678
How's Yusef?

23:49.761 --> 23:51.388
Yeah, Yusef's making his way.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.849
Studying the Koran,
learning his faith, you know.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.350
And school, of course.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.353
Wish they had a school where Korey is.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.023
Ain't got no school in Auburn Maximum.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.944
And now they got him
in an isolation unit and...

24:07.154 --> 24:09.948
-he having a tough time up there.
-I can't imagine.

24:10.365 --> 24:14.286
He was too young
to go straight to an adult prison.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.623
I keep him in prayer always, I do.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.292
I pray for Kevin too.

24:20.709 --> 24:21.835
For all the boys.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.424
Hey, Ms. Grace, how you doing?
Are you coming to the rally?

24:30.802 --> 24:34.473
Would you mind having Yusef write Korey?

24:34.973 --> 24:37.434
I mean, it would give him such a lift,

24:37.517 --> 24:40.896
and God knows he could use a boost
right about now. Can you just--

24:40.979 --> 24:42.981
-I can't do that.
-Why?

24:44.316 --> 24:46.985
They cannot communicate
as convicted felons.

24:47.068 --> 24:50.614
They can't share communications
across facilities.

24:50.697 --> 24:51.990
It's the state law.

24:52.908 --> 24:56.036
We could help them with that
and it'll be easy.

24:56.369 --> 24:58.747
You see him and get a letter,
you give it to me,

24:58.830 --> 25:00.332
and then I'll give one to Korey,

25:00.415 --> 25:03.376
and then we'll just go
back and forth with them like that.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.924
He asks about him, Sharonne.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.551
I'm trying to get Yusef home.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.637
<i>Home.</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:15.639
Sooner rather than later.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.391
He could get home next year
with good time.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.395
I can't have him engage
in this funny business you talking about.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.563
Oh!

25:23.855 --> 25:25.065
I just can't do that.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.111
You take care of yourself.
You give my best to Korey.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.007
<i>I invoke the perfect words of Allah</i>

25:51.091 --> 25:54.261
<i>to protect us against the evil</i>
<i>that may come from Sky or Earth,</i>

25:54.678 --> 25:56.596
<i>against the tests of Night and Day,</i>

in the name of Allah,
gracious and merciful.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.726
<i>Subhan Allah.</i>

26:04.312 --> 26:05.355
You've been studying.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.440
I can tell.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.902
-You staying close to the brothers?
<i>-</i>Like you told me.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.070
I like 'em.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.115
They treat me good. We talk.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.493
That's good, son. That's very good.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.955
How's Aisha and Shareef?

26:22.664 --> 26:25.584
They're fine. They send their love.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.502
And how's work?

26:28.878 --> 26:31.464
<i>I just don't know if I can keep</i>
<i>sending her there.</i>

26:31.548 --> 26:35.176
<i>I mean, my daughter is...</i>
<i>Well, I'm not going to say who she is,</i>

26:35.468 --> 26:37.429
<i>but she's a victim</i>
<i>of this kind of thing herself,</i>

26:37.512 --> 26:41.349
<i>this kind of tragedy,</i>
<i>and it's taken us years to get past it.</i>

26:42.517 --> 26:45.395
<i>The guy was a fucking scum.</i>
<i>They don't deserve to live,</i>

26:45.478 --> 26:48.690
<i>let alone have jobs at what I thought</i>
<i>was a reputable institution. </i>

26:48.815 --> 26:50.942
<i>-Guess I'll have to talk--</i>

26:53.361 --> 26:55.530
-I don't want to beg.
- Sharonne, I agree.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.698
Let's not beg.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.619
I think it'll be better
for everyone involved.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.621
<i>We're gonna have to let you go.</i>

27:08.001 --> 27:09.669
First interview was great.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.381
Second interview, even better.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.719
Then same old, same old.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.348
They find out about Yusef...

27:24.309 --> 27:26.269
I'm pretty fucking sure that's illegal.

27:26.853 --> 27:27.937
Sue they ass.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.690
I don't want to see another lawyer

27:31.149 --> 27:33.526
or another court date ever again
in my life.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.278
I'm still paying them bills.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.072
You'll find something else.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.407
It's the racket they running
in them facilities.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.326
That's the real crime.

27:41.785 --> 27:45.413
You know, one ten-minute phone call
from Yusef costs $23.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.207
Shit!

27:47.666 --> 27:49.376
Where am I gonna get that from?

27:54.339 --> 27:56.633
<i>My name is Sharonne Salaam,</i>

27:57.509 --> 27:59.969
and I'm here to learn
about public assistance.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.514
Work's fine.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.725
Your brothers and sisters are fine.
Don't worry about that now.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.895
You need to focus on you.

28:09.604 --> 28:13.233
So, tell me what you been thinking about.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.569
What's going on in there?

28:20.699 --> 28:21.574
I been...

28:21.700 --> 28:23.702
I been thinking a lot about Korey.

28:26.329 --> 28:29.165
Nobody's heard from him
since they transferred him from Rikers.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.335
He wasn't even on the list.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.424
He came to look after me
so I wouldn't disappoint you.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.764
And now we don't know where he is.

28:48.059 --> 28:48.935
It's not right.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.020
Baby, what you feel about Korey...

28:53.523 --> 28:55.275
that means you are a good person.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.987
But you need to focus on you right now.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.531
You need to stick with the brothers.

29:01.614 --> 29:04.325
You need to study. That's all I need
for you to do while you in here.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.245
And then soon,
you will all be home and you and Korey

29:07.328 --> 29:08.955
will have plenty to talk about.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.542
People hate us out there.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.672
They hate your brilliance.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.384
They hate your beauty.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.970
They hate us.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.433
But we not gonna hate ourselves.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.314
Home.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.191
Yeah, son.

29:37.901 --> 29:38.985

Get in there.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.505

29:58.588 --> 30:00.715

still looking out for each other?

31:32.682 --> 31:33.725
Uh...

31:35.852 --> 31:39.188
You know,
Yusef's really with the Muslim guys now.

31:39.981 --> 31:40.857
Um...

31:41.566 --> 31:42.483
Like...

31:42.567 --> 31:44.569
-I don't know.
-That's okay.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.404
Look at me.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.449
He's got something to look forward to.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.409
You have to find one too.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.538
That's the trick of a happy life.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.625
Imma tell you a story
I ain't never told you.

32:01.544 --> 32:04.380
Imma tell you how it works
when you got something to look forward to.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.593
<i>You know, my co-workers,</i>
<i>they were polite,</i>

32:08.968 --> 32:10.511
<i>but I wasn't close to anyone.</i>

32:10.720 --> 32:13.932
<i>They didn't want to be close to me,</i>
<i>and I thought I deserved that,</i>

32:14.015 --> 32:15.016
<i>so I accepted it.</i>

32:15.308 --> 32:18.937
<i>I was alone a lot, just doing</i>
<i>what I had to do to get through the day.</i>

32:19.979 --> 32:20.980
That's not life.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.690
And it's not happiness.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.235
Happiness is something to look forward to.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.035
<i>♪ Happy feelin's in the air ♪</i>

Hi.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.458
Um, welcome to Thrifty.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.251
How can I be of service?

32:42.335 --> 32:45.755
Yes, please. I, uh, need to rent a minivan
for the weekend.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.218
Okay, we have a lot of options.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.678
This one right here is...

32:53.012 --> 32:54.138
great for the wife,

32:54.889 --> 32:56.099
kids, the whole family.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.560
How's it for taking your grandma
and her friends to Atlantic City

32:59.644 --> 33:02.355
for their All-Star Mega Bingo game?

33:04.023 --> 33:05.358
Very good for that too.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.695
<i>I rented him that van</i>
<i>for three days.</i>

33:09.070 --> 33:11.698
And I'm telling you,
waiting for him to return it,

33:12.073 --> 33:14.993

33:43.104 --> 33:44.105
Um...

33:47.442 --> 33:48.568
-What?
- Mm-hm.

33:48.651 --> 33:49.652
You said no.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.405
-Yeah, I said no.
-Hold on, hold on. Okay...

33:52.572 --> 33:54.449
- No, I--
-No, no, no, no, no.

33:54.907 --> 33:58.161
You waited on him for three days
and three nights

just to say no when he asked you out?

33:59.829 --> 34:02.081
Hold on, there's more to the story.
There's more--

34:02.165 --> 34:03.833
Why did you say no?

34:06.294 --> 34:07.420
Why did you say no?

34:09.005 --> 34:13.384
Because I didn't think I should be
having fun, in romance and whatever,

34:13.509 --> 34:14.594
while you're in here.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.556
I'm part of the reason you're in here.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.436
Let me tell you, I was...

34:25.146 --> 34:27.440
I was really down the last couple years.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.359
And I...

34:33.237 --> 34:34.322
I feel just...

34:35.573 --> 34:37.033
I feel guilty you're in here.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.328
Don't feel like that.
I don't want you to feel like that.

34:40.411 --> 34:43.164
No, it's okay, though.
I wish I'd known better.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.750
Remember how to do things
at the precinct.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.337
My mama schooled me, didn't you?

34:50.046 --> 34:51.589
All the guilt.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.301
It's lazy energy.
It doesn't change the past.

34:58.346 --> 35:02.350
And it doesn't shape the future,
and it's a waste.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.312
And we got no time to waste.
We gotta live. Hm?

35:12.235 --> 35:13.736
So we went on a couple dates.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.531
That's good.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.117
That's good. I'm happy for you.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.036
Chris is my something to look forward to.

35:23.955 --> 35:27.875
Studying his religion,
that's what Yusef looks forward to.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.338
You find your something, Kevin.

35:44.058 --> 35:45.059
I love you.

36:04.704 --> 36:07.707
-It's changed a lot, huh?
-Yeah, it's changed a lot.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.502
I want to see it all.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.255
I even want to see the park.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.718
You know, I hear that they redid it.

36:19.385 --> 36:21.262
You know, maybe one of these days...

36:22.096 --> 36:22.930
we...

36:33.941 --> 36:35.568
It's okay. You got time.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.322
A lot's changed,
but you know what ain't changed?

36:41.407 --> 36:42.241
You.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.119
That was my biggest prayer for you.

36:45.661 --> 36:49.081
That you'd stay safe.
That you'd stay your sweet self.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.588
I know you seen things,

36:56.464 --> 36:57.840
maybe had to do things,

36:58.174 --> 36:59.342
defend yourself,

36:59.592 --> 37:01.844
survive, whatever might've happened.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.180
But in the end...

37:06.807 --> 37:08.184
you have the same heart.

But you've gotta show your face here

38:20.006 --> 38:21.424
or they will reincarcerate.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.259
For the rest of my life?

38:23.426 --> 38:25.761
All right, so, do you know your curfew?

38:25.845 --> 38:27.763
Yes, sir, 7:00 p.m. till 9:00 a.m.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.474
-And where must you be during that time?
-At home.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.143
The law says inside the house.

38:32.226 --> 38:34.854
That's not on the sidewalk,
that's not on the stoop, inside.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.023
All night, every night, till 9:00 a.m.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.692
What happens when I get a job
and my boss makes me come early?

38:39.775 --> 38:41.068
You get a different job.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.030
You ever been employed outside of prison?

38:44.113 --> 38:46.032
You ever filled out a job application?

38:49.076 --> 38:50.077
It's just practice.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.041
Hold up. Gotta do your boxes.

38:56.709 --> 38:59.045
"A: Have you ever been incarcerated?"

38:59.128 --> 39:01.047
"B: Have you ever committed a felony?"

39:01.213 --> 39:05.051
Now, "have you committed a felony,"
that box right there, that protects you.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.886
See old boy back there?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.722
That's Vince Martinez.

39:11.932 --> 39:14.769
Four years up at Clinton,
simple possession of narcotics.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.520
He's been out 15 years.

39:17.396 --> 39:19.148
Now, you check that box as a felon,

39:19.523 --> 39:22.401
and right away,
you're not working on shift with Martinez,

39:22.485 --> 39:23.569
'cause he's a felon too.

39:23.944 --> 39:27.615
And as a condition of your CR,
you can't associate with felons.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.410
Now, what's gonna happen
when you don't check that box

39:31.660 --> 39:33.662
and you end up working the fry
beside Martinez

39:33.746 --> 39:35.289
because they just scheduled you that way?

39:35.664 --> 39:37.041
You'll be reincarcerated.

39:38.292 --> 39:39.668
"Are you a registered sex offender?"

39:39.752 --> 39:41.337
That's the box that tells your supervisor,

39:41.420 --> 39:44.131
"Don't put me out on the counter
handing out no Happy Meals."

39:44.215 --> 39:45.508
Or you'll go upstate in a heartbeat.

39:45.966 --> 39:49.178
Level three sex offenders can't be around
any children that's not family.

39:49.303 --> 39:50.346
That's forever, right?

39:50.429 --> 39:51.931
Not just the next three years.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.352

Man, whoever will take you.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.399
Raymond Santana Jr.

40:05.444 --> 40:10.366
My pop told me to ask for his boss,
Mrs. Bakry.

40:10.616 --> 40:13.452
My pop said, uh, said she knew about me,

40:13.536 --> 40:15.287
she'd walk the application through.

40:17.790 --> 40:21.001
Mrs. Bakry retired two weeks ago.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.093
Please, I've been on so many interviews.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.803
I just need one chance.

40:36.225 --> 40:39.311
Your application will be processed,
like everyone else.

40:41.856 --> 40:42.857
Thank you.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.412
Yo, what up, Ray?

41:18.851 --> 41:20.436
You gotta get it
chopped up in there

41:20.519 --> 41:22.605
and go in there and go, "Oooh!"

41:22.980 --> 41:24.315
Woo-woo!

41:24.398 --> 41:25.983
- Yeah.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.655
Look! It's flying!

41:33.699 --> 41:34.575
You know...

41:37.119 --> 41:38.746
when we first moved in,

41:39.079 --> 41:39.955
it was all new.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.957
And Grandma'd always be on me,

41:42.041 --> 41:45.044
"Get your feet off the furniture, child!"

41:45.127 --> 41:46.837
Now look what they're doing, man.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.674
Took Uncle Manny and me probably, like,
two months to upholster that couch.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.844
Look, if something is bothering you,
just say something, man.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.137
Don't hold it in.

41:55.304 --> 41:56.805
'Cause I'm not a mind reader.

42:01.894 --> 42:05.397
The spaceship's coming again!

42:05.481 --> 42:07.233
-There you go, little man.
- Come on!

42:07.358 --> 42:08.901
Good job, champ.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.999
I cooked that food
for us to eat later!

42:25.709 --> 42:26.961
I'm sorry.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.296
I saw the kid was eating,
so I thought it was okay.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.007
- What did you do to Mom? Huh?

42:33.509 --> 42:36.053
This isn't prison.
Here we eat at the table!

42:36.136 --> 42:37.429
Like <i>normal </i>people.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.390
- I thought it was okay.
- You eat at the table!

42:39.473 --> 42:41.517
He didn't know. Sorry, sorry.
He didn't know.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.067
Yo, Elena, can you tell your family

42:50.150 --> 42:52.903
to please respect the furniture
and turn down the TV?

42:55.364 --> 42:57.366
You gonna let him talk to me like that?

42:57.658 --> 42:58.492
Huh?

42:58.826 --> 43:01.787
You think I'm letting
a rapist disrespect me in my own house

43:01.870 --> 43:04.331
-and tell me what to do?
- You calling me a rapist?

43:05.374 --> 43:07.084
- You don't know me!
- Let it go!

43:07.167 --> 43:09.128
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

43:09.712 --> 43:12.464
At no time have I ever hurt a woman, man!

43:12.631 --> 43:14.842
Never! Never!

43:14.925 --> 43:17.636
- Pa, tell her what I said!
-She understands.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.848
Please don't provoke him.
Okay? Don't provoke him.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.892
Control your son! Control your son!

43:23.976 --> 43:26.228
You can't do like that, man.
You can't do like that.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.397
Elena's my wife, all right? She's my wife.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.649
If you're gonna be here, you gotta
respect her 'cause this is her house.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.109
Where was <i>her </i>respect?

43:34.153 --> 43:35.613
I gotta live here, man.

43:35.946 --> 43:38.741
I ain't got nowhere else to go.
I got nothing.

43:41.744 --> 43:42.745
I got nothing.

43:43.203 --> 43:45.122
I'm telling you, it's gonna get easier.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.583
Look at me, look at me, man.
I'm telling you.

43:47.666 --> 43:50.461
But you gotta work with me.
You gotta do your part, baby, all right?

43:51.587 --> 43:52.421
All right?

44:08.896 --> 44:11.231
You do that like
you really care about it.

44:11.940 --> 44:13.776
Like you really care
about getting this clean

44:13.859 --> 44:15.235
for people you don't even know.

44:16.528 --> 44:18.906
You're a priest with a part-time job,
ain't you?

44:22.409 --> 44:23.494
Priest, no, ma'am.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.997
I guess I just like
making dirty things shine, that's all.

44:27.081 --> 44:27.998
Hm.

44:28.457 --> 44:30.376
Well, I like dirty things too.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.555
Oh, I've been here for a while.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.349
Though I ain't seen you around.

44:45.683 --> 44:46.975
Maybe you ain't been looking.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.227
Oh!

44:48.644 --> 44:49.645
I'm looking.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.606
Yo, you used to live in Lehman?

44:54.692 --> 44:55.818
Uh, nah.

44:56.652 --> 44:57.528

44:58.362 --> 45:01.240
-Where I know you from?
-I can't help you, bro. I ain't from here.

45:07.579 --> 45:09.832
You told me you were from Harlem.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.296
I am, I...

45:16.630 --> 45:19.842
just ain't wasting time talking to dudes
trying to start some shit, you know?

45:20.426 --> 45:22.219
Next, he'll be hitting me up for cash.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.972
Negro, please. I know your jam.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.099
You're just all about the ladies.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.184
<i>♪ Walking down the street ♪</i>

45:29.268 --> 45:31.311
<i>♪ Watching ladies go by ♪</i>

45:31.395 --> 45:32.855
<i>♪ Watching you... ♪</i>

45:35.441 --> 45:36.692
Whoa, where you been?

45:39.653 --> 45:41.321
So... Man, you got a head of hair.

45:41.405 --> 45:44.575
What kind of barber they got cutting that?
Yo, where was you at?

45:44.658 --> 45:48.996
Uh, Downstate. Harlem Valley before that.
I cut hair there.

45:49.079 --> 45:51.331
That's seems right,
'cause you was known for your hair.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.709
Flat top, right? Lil Daddy Kane!

45:55.127 --> 45:56.462
Yeah, I remember.

45:57.463 --> 46:00.716
Man, I think you'll find that most folks
up in the neighborhood,

46:00.799 --> 46:02.676
they know the real story on you boys.

46:02.760 --> 46:06.054
But south of 110th, I can't say.
Down there, they is ignorant.

46:06.513 --> 46:07.973
And we is never innocent.

46:08.390 --> 46:10.559
But if I was you,
I'd stay clear of the park.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.436
I think you should go everywhere.

46:12.519 --> 46:15.230
You know, live like a free man,
don't box yourself in.

46:15.314 --> 46:18.358
Yo, that's true! That's true.
Haters bound to do plenty of that for you.

46:18.817 --> 46:20.444
So, what's your next move?

46:21.904 --> 46:23.989
By which I mean, after that booty call.

46:24.072 --> 46:25.949
You know a man's gotta prioritize!

46:27.618 --> 46:29.620
-Oh, shit, y'all Muslim!

46:29.703 --> 46:32.748
Oh, I'm sorry.
You gotta be married first, right?

46:32.831 --> 46:34.416
Man, he just got out yesterday.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.084
You've got him married already?

46:38.378 --> 46:39.797
I wanna go back to school.

46:40.005 --> 46:42.883
-Maybe teach, I'm not sure.
- Yeah? You have a state license?

46:42.966 --> 46:44.968
How you gonna do that
when you've been incarcerated?

46:46.470 --> 46:47.721
I can't get a license?

46:48.680 --> 46:50.474
Not in no certified occupation.

46:51.517 --> 46:53.477
Bus driver, teacher, EMT.

46:54.603 --> 46:56.939
No, once you've been inside, man,
they got you.

46:57.314 --> 46:58.398
And they keep you.

47:00.692 --> 47:01.568
Right.

47:05.364 --> 47:06.782
How you doing, Mrs. Garcia?

47:16.250 --> 47:17.084
Elombe!

47:18.460 --> 47:20.546
- Look who it is!
- Hey, how are you?

47:20.629 --> 47:22.464
Now, don't give me
that "how are you" jive.

47:22.548 --> 47:23.757
-Ray!
-Ms. Brath!

47:23.841 --> 47:25.300
Now, why you been ducking us?

47:25.384 --> 47:28.345
Nah, it's not like that.
I just didn't wanna bother you.

47:28.428 --> 47:31.807
Bother us? Raymond, we're here for you.
It's never a bother.

47:31.890 --> 47:33.392
Thank you. Both of you.

47:33.600 --> 47:37.521
I know you helped out Pops,
protesting and everything. Money too.

47:37.604 --> 47:38.814
That's what we're here for.

47:38.897 --> 47:41.275
If you can't lean on your community
in the most trying times,

47:41.358 --> 47:42.734
then who can you lean on?

47:42.943 --> 47:44.152
I appreciate that.

47:46.530 --> 47:47.990
I'll see you at home, Elombe.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.787
-You, do not be a stranger, please, Ray.
-I won't.

47:54.997 --> 47:56.290
-Thank you.
-Okay.

47:56.623 --> 47:58.625
-How you holding up?

47:58.750 --> 47:59.668
I don't know.

48:00.085 --> 48:02.588
There's a couple of things
that you should know 100 percent.

48:02.921 --> 48:04.756
One, you got support.

48:05.799 --> 48:10.345
The second thing is that
they are counting on you going back in.

48:12.222 --> 48:13.557
That ain't gonna be me.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.101
They ain't gonna get me again.

48:16.435 --> 48:17.519
Amen.

48:18.645 --> 48:19.897
So, you got a girl?

48:20.314 --> 48:21.565
Somebody writing you?

48:24.818 --> 48:26.278
I still keep pictures of her.

48:26.695 --> 48:27.613
We wrote a lot.

48:27.696 --> 48:31.241
She wrote first to say she thought
I was innocent, that she was sorry.

48:31.325 --> 48:32.868
She thought I was cute or whatever.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.914
When I went up for parole,
it didn't go my way.

48:37.414 --> 48:40.208
So I wrote her and said,
"I'm no good for you. Don't wait."

48:40.292 --> 48:42.586
So you broke up with her
before she could break up with you.

48:42.836 --> 48:46.757
It was more like I was going up
to adult prison with that tag:

48:47.215 --> 48:48.258
sex offender.

48:50.093 --> 48:51.762
I didn't know if I'd make it out.

48:51.970 --> 48:53.055
But you did.

48:53.388 --> 48:54.348
Now what?

48:54.806 --> 48:57.851
That's the question
that you have to ask yourself.

48:59.895 --> 49:01.104
Go get your life, man.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.315
Take it back.

49:05.984 --> 49:07.194
And you ain't that cute.

49:21.124 --> 49:21.959
<i>Hello?</i>

49:22.042 --> 49:25.045
<i>Tanya, this is Ray Santana.</i>

49:25.754 --> 49:27.422
<i> Oh, hey, Ray.</i>

49:29.925 --> 49:34.596
You know, when you...
when you just stopped writing, I...

49:36.723 --> 49:37.683
I don't know.

49:38.141 --> 49:39.017
It hurt.

49:40.018 --> 49:41.478
Was no way for me to reach you.

49:41.895 --> 49:44.064
Not like I could just come by or whatever.

49:44.606 --> 49:46.525
I don't know how to do this,

49:46.733 --> 49:48.777
except just tell you the truth.

49:49.736 --> 49:51.405
I shouldn't have did that to you.

49:52.656 --> 49:54.908
I just didn't want to bring you down
to where I was.

49:55.158 --> 49:57.661
I hear what you're saying, but I...

49:58.286 --> 49:59.329
I don't get it.

50:00.288 --> 50:02.916
No, look, we had something good,
and then you just...

50:03.000 --> 50:05.168
I don't understand how you just
cut me off like that.

50:05.669 --> 50:08.755
Nothing all that bad ever happened to me
before the park.

50:10.173 --> 50:11.591
Before, I had hope.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.678
After, I had none,
not even about me and you.

50:21.143 --> 50:22.144
I'm sorry.

50:30.569 --> 50:33.071
<i>Monday night in New York,</i>
<i>President Clinton could laugh</i>

50:33.155 --> 50:35.157
<i>about the rash of White House scandals...</i>

50:42.706 --> 50:45.876
Elena!
This asshole has a girl in his room.

50:46.793 --> 50:48.712
-Who do you have in there?!
- What are you doing?

50:49.129 --> 50:50.047
Who the fuck is that?

50:50.672 --> 50:54.676
Leave us the fuck alone!
This ain't even your house, lady!

50:54.760 --> 50:57.429
Are you with a chick in the baby's room?

50:57.679 --> 50:59.973
You are a dirty, shameless girl!

51:00.057 --> 51:02.517
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- You didn't know what?

51:02.726 --> 51:04.061
No, she's my stepmother!

51:04.144 --> 51:05.604
You are a dirty man!

51:05.687 --> 51:06.521
Stop!

51:07.564 --> 51:10.150
-Listen, wait! Please!
-Don't fucking touch me!

51:10.233 --> 51:12.027
I swear, I'm not lying!

51:12.110 --> 51:13.945
-That's my stepmother!
-Get off me.

51:14.029 --> 51:17.074
Look, I'm not going back in there, okay?
And I got nowhere to take you, so--

51:17.157 --> 51:20.660
That's okay. We'll go sit somewhere.
We'll go to the park!

51:23.205 --> 51:24.414
No, I think...

51:24.539 --> 51:26.249
Maybe we had it right
the first time. This...

51:26.541 --> 51:27.751
-You know...

51:27.834 --> 51:30.337
-We're no good.
-I'm not letting you go like that.

51:31.046 --> 51:32.589
I made that mistake already.

51:33.799 --> 51:35.008
Imma call you tomorrow.

51:36.927 --> 51:37.928
You gonna answer?

51:53.193 --> 51:54.569
That'll be two dollars.

51:57.906 --> 52:00.242
-Thank you.
- Thank you, brother. Appreciate it.

52:03.745 --> 52:05.997
How come you never take me out
for chicken and waffles?

52:07.499 --> 52:08.834
Why don't you take me out?

52:09.709 --> 52:11.002
Let's go to Amy Ruth.

52:11.378 --> 52:14.840
Everybody always be talking about
the chicken and waffles at Amy Ruth.

52:14.923 --> 52:16.007
That's for tourists.

52:16.091 --> 52:17.759
Well, I <i>am </i>a tourist.

52:18.343 --> 52:19.344
I wanna go.

52:19.928 --> 52:22.764
Don't make no sense to eat in
no restaurant. I gotta save for school.

52:22.889 --> 52:24.558
You can save for school next week.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.811
I have to save for school every week.
You know what I take home.

52:27.894 --> 52:29.563
Yeah. Three hundred dollars.

52:29.646 --> 52:30.689
Every two weeks.

52:31.189 --> 52:34.317
And 100 of that goes to my mother 'cause
you gotta take care of the ones you love.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.736
I keep $100 for myself,

52:36.820 --> 52:39.906
and if I could save every one
of those dollars for school, I would.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.658
You're so selfish.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.035
We've been talking for months.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.163
I don't ask you to go out every week.
All you do is stay inside.

52:49.416 --> 52:51.793
If I'd been in prison for them years,
I would wanna go out.

52:51.877 --> 52:53.420
You don't know what you would want.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.797
I'm not spending money on stuff
that don't matter.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.175
I don't matter?

52:59.634 --> 53:00.886
That's what you saying?

53:01.678 --> 53:03.638
-I don't matter?
-I gotta go to school, Adelle.

53:04.347 --> 53:05.765
I gotta get my life back.

53:06.308 --> 53:08.602
Adelle! Listen, look...

53:11.855 --> 53:14.733
Look, we don't gotta talk to each other
if I make you unhappy.

53:17.110 --> 53:19.237
I mean, I... I get it. It's cool.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.532
Are you trying to break up with me?

53:24.201 --> 53:26.912
-I'm just saying--
-You acting like a fucking inmate!

53:27.495 --> 53:28.788
You fucking felon!

53:30.290 --> 53:31.791
Oh, this how you treat girls?

53:33.293 --> 53:34.169
It is.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.421
I know what you do to 'em.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.298
Like you did to that lady.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.717
Fucking asshole!

56:02.192 --> 56:06.279
I can't wait to take you out, you know,
to somewhere other than here.

56:06.529 --> 56:07.864
Maybe eat something.

56:07.947 --> 56:09.240
Yeah, where you wanna go?

56:12.869 --> 56:14.204
Yo, what up?

56:14.287 --> 56:16.164
I got a place I want to take you.

56:16.456 --> 56:17.332
<i>Yo, Leonard!</i>

56:17.582 --> 56:19.000
Yo, Ray!

56:19.376 --> 56:20.502
Ray, hey!

56:23.088 --> 56:25.173
Looking for, uh, these?

56:25.256 --> 56:27.717
Oh, look at that!
The Virgin Mary looking right at you!<i> </i>Oh!

56:27.801 --> 56:30.762
Keep her safe. Yo, keep it down.
Don't make too much noise.

56:30.845 --> 56:32.138
My sister just took the spot upstairs.

56:41.981 --> 56:42.982
Thank you.

56:49.364 --> 56:50.281
Nice!

56:51.116 --> 56:52.575
No, that wasn't me.

56:56.246 --> 56:58.540
Yo! Don't break it.

56:59.416 --> 57:00.750
- Come on.
-Not yet.

57:05.046 --> 57:05.922
Now?

58:08.902 --> 58:09.777
Hi!

58:09.861 --> 58:11.196
Oof! You scared me.
-I wanna show you something.
-Okay.

58:18.620 --> 58:21.206
You know my cousin Drea, right? Um...

58:21.748 --> 58:22.916
She moving out in June.

58:23.500 --> 58:26.211
It's got, like, a little side room.

58:27.128 --> 58:31.299
You know, and I was thinking that we could
have our own... our own space together?

58:35.136 --> 58:37.388
Oh, you mean you and me?

58:37.972 --> 58:39.641
Yeah. Yeah.

58:39.891 --> 58:41.476
Um, like...

58:41.809 --> 58:45.813
I could use my teacher's assistant stipend
for the security deposit and then...

58:45.980 --> 58:48.066
all we have to do is first
and last month's rent.

58:49.317 --> 58:51.069
We could do that, right?

58:56.366 --> 58:57.408
Yeah, yeah.

58:58.159 --> 58:59.327
-Yeah?
-Maybe.

58:59.410 --> 59:02.163
If Siegel keeps letting me work
double shifts.

59:07.502 --> 59:09.295
Siegel said to give you this.

59:40.702 --> 59:41.869
What's good, man?

59:42.954 --> 59:43.830
I'm good.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.459
Yeah, you know, I was wondering...

59:50.336 --> 59:53.923
if y'all might be interested
in taking on a new partner.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.717
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

59:56.426 --> 59:57.844
If y'all wanna negotiate...

1:00:22.243 --> 1:00:23.119
Kevin...
Yo!

1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:28.625
Ohhh...

1:00:29.959 --> 1:00:31.377
It's good to see you, man.

1:00:31.461 --> 1:00:32.712
Me too, man.

1:00:33.004 --> 1:00:35.632
-And you look good, man.
-Look at you!

1:00:36.382 --> 1:00:38.551
-Ohh!
-Man, we allowed to sit together?

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:40.553
This probably the one place
in the whole universe

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:43.097
where nobody care if we see each other.
Come on now.

1:00:43.514 --> 1:00:45.350
You look good, man.

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:48.895
-Yo, what happened there?
-Oh, man.

1:00:49.395 --> 1:00:50.438
Got this new PO.

1:00:50.521 --> 1:00:53.608
For no reason, he show up telling me
I gotta wear an ankle bracelet now.

1:00:53.691 --> 1:00:55.026
That's cold.

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:57.779
You been able to work?

1:00:57.862 --> 1:00:59.656
Yeah. Computer maintenance.

1:01:00.156 --> 1:01:02.659
Monitoring systems
for this telemarketing company.

1:01:02.742 --> 1:01:04.577
What? How the hell you learn computers?

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:05.662
Lied.

1:01:07.246 --> 1:01:08.456
I tell 'em I can do it.

1:01:08.539 --> 1:01:10.541
Aisha lent me a couple,
I bought some books,

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:11.834
just learned on the job.

1:01:11.918 --> 1:01:13.211
-Of course you did.
-Of course I did.

1:01:13.294 --> 1:01:14.796
Yusef been lying on the job, man.

1:01:14.879 --> 1:01:16.714
-You in the back.

1:01:16.798 --> 1:01:19.217
If you're new,
I need to see your paperwork.

1:01:41.906 --> 1:01:43.199
Get used to that look.

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:46.160
I never thought I'd grow up to be someone
that people hated.

1:01:46.369 --> 1:01:47.787
Hey, your mother don't hate you.

1:01:47.870 --> 1:01:50.248
Your sisters don't hate you.
You got love, man.

1:01:50.331 --> 1:01:51.999
Them women love them some you.

1:01:52.333 --> 1:01:53.292
True.

1:01:54.085 --> 1:01:56.087
My mom, she just hugs me random all day.

1:01:56.379 --> 1:01:58.673
I walk to the bathroom,
come back to a hug.

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:02.927
-I don't mind, neither.
-Yeah, you stay in that long as you can.

1:02:03.010 --> 1:02:05.346
Don't be in no rush to go
if they don't want you gone.

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:06.848
You still staying with your moms?

1:02:07.807 --> 1:02:09.016
Actually, no.

1:02:09.767 --> 1:02:10.810
I got married.

1:02:12.353 --> 1:02:13.312
What?

1:02:16.816 --> 1:02:17.734
Dude!

1:02:19.569 --> 1:02:23.239
How long you known this girl?
You only been out for, like, nine months?

1:02:23.322 --> 1:02:24.198
Seven.

1:02:24.532 --> 1:02:25.867
Her name Lakeisha.

1:02:25.950 --> 1:02:28.870
I met her at work one day
when I was coming in to get a check.

1:02:28.953 --> 1:02:31.122
She got a management job there
during the day.

1:02:31.205 --> 1:02:33.416
Well, if you working nights
and she working days,

1:02:33.499 --> 1:02:35.501
how y'all see each other?

1:02:35.585 --> 1:02:37.545
Oh, we make it work.
We do what we gotta do, right?

1:02:38.546 --> 1:02:42.300
Today, we have Yusef Salaam
and Kevin Richardson,

1:02:42.383 --> 1:02:45.303
two of New York's most notorious
sex offenders.

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:48.639
-The Wilding Boys of Central Park.
-This again.

1:02:48.723 --> 1:02:50.558
To be eligible for release,

1:02:50.641 --> 1:02:54.187
the offender must acknowledge
having committed his sex offense.

1:02:54.270 --> 1:02:56.814
Okay, Richardson, stand up.
Let's start with you.

1:02:57.023 --> 1:02:58.608
We don't talk about our case.

1:02:59.358 --> 1:03:00.651
I didn't ask you, Salaam.

1:03:02.528 --> 1:03:04.322
If you don't mind, ma'am,
I won't say anything.

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:06.949
Well, in my class, that's not an option.

1:03:08.159 --> 1:03:11.788
I don't admit to the crime.
'Cause I like to stick to the truth.

1:03:13.915 --> 1:03:17.001
You're a convicted
class three sexual predator.

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:19.879
See, that's the law, not the truth.
Let me illuminate you--

1:03:19.962 --> 1:03:21.088
Sit down, Salaam.

1:03:21.172 --> 1:03:23.132
When the State of New York
put us on trial,

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:25.468
did we accept the plea they offered us?

1:03:25.718 --> 1:03:27.553
No. And why is that?

1:03:28.679 --> 1:03:31.432
'Cause we didn't do the crime
and we don't want to lie.

1:03:31.557 --> 1:03:33.142
So when we never lied before,

1:03:33.518 --> 1:03:35.978
why would we start lying now for you?

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:41.567
Salaam, this is, what, the fifth group
you've been asked to leave?

1:03:42.985 --> 1:03:44.278
You do what you gotta do.

1:03:45.154 --> 1:03:46.322
You gonna make trouble too?

1:03:51.702 --> 1:03:53.287
- Look at you.
- That was choice.

1:03:53.371 --> 1:03:55.164
Yeah, that felt good, man.

1:03:55.373 --> 1:03:57.625
Let's hang out, man.
Where's everybody? Where's Antron at?

1:03:57.708 --> 1:03:59.877
Oh, his father passed
a couple months back.

1:04:00.169 --> 1:04:01.295
-Ah, man.
-Yeah.

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:03.798
He moved to Baltimore
as soon as his CR was up.

1:04:03.881 --> 1:04:06.092
Changed his name,
talking about getting married.

1:04:06.175 --> 1:04:07.093
-For real?
-Yeah.

1:04:07.176 --> 1:04:09.804
-Y'all moving fast now.
-We just ready to get started with life.

1:04:09.887 --> 1:04:11.347
Too much time wasted.

1:04:11.514 --> 1:04:13.391
Korey. Where is he?

1:04:13.474 --> 1:04:15.393
I'm not even sure his mama know where.

1:04:15.476 --> 1:04:17.186
But they still got him somewhere.

1:04:18.604 --> 1:04:20.940
When we finish our CR,
we gotta track him down.

1:04:21.899 --> 1:04:22.900
Yeah.

1:04:24.318 --> 1:04:25.695
Who else you talk to? Talk to Ray?

1:04:26.195 --> 1:04:29.448
<i>I don't know, man.</i>
<i>I been hearing things. Bad things.</i>

1:05:29.884 --> 1:05:31.469
I got a little surprise for you.

1:05:33.095 --> 1:05:34.138
See that?

1:05:36.474 --> 1:05:38.601
Papi, it's my birthday!

1:05:38.809 --> 1:05:41.562
It ain't your birthday, little man.
Your birthday's in December.

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:48.152
It's okay.

1:05:54.283 --> 1:05:55.868
Tanya and me got our keys.

1:05:56.911 --> 1:05:58.788
-I'll be clearing out tomorrow.

1:06:00.831 --> 1:06:01.749
Good for you.

1:06:02.041 --> 1:06:04.210
Maybe turn my room into Ramón's.

1:06:07.213 --> 1:06:08.172
Nah, man.

1:06:08.255 --> 1:06:10.257
This is how I took back my life.

1:06:10.341 --> 1:06:13.010
-Just a boost to get started.
-Ray, Ray...

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:14.470
You got a brain, right?

1:06:14.887 --> 1:06:17.431
Pushing crack?
Come on, you know where this is going.

1:06:17.515 --> 1:06:18.766
It's just to get started,

1:06:18.891 --> 1:06:21.227
get out of here, give you space,

1:06:21.310 --> 1:06:24.063
-get my own.
-Thank you, but get that out of my house.

1:06:24.146 --> 1:06:25.648
Get it out of my house.

1:06:33.197 --> 1:06:34.865
When everything was going on,

1:06:36.117 --> 1:06:38.411
I couldn't really follow
what was happening.

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:39.829
I didn't get it.

1:06:41.122 --> 1:06:43.624
Inside, I started reading the articles,

1:06:44.041 --> 1:06:47.420
how they wrote them against us
from the first days,

1:06:47.878 --> 1:06:49.588
all the transcripts,

1:06:50.089 --> 1:06:51.882
the straight-up lies they told.

1:06:52.216 --> 1:06:53.384
I watched my tape.

1:06:54.135 --> 1:06:56.721
<i>I don't even know who that fucking kid is.</i>

1:06:56.887 --> 1:06:59.098
-I don't even recognize myself.
-I know, Ray.

1:06:59.181 --> 1:07:02.643
I know, but what those people
stole from you, you can't buy back.

1:07:03.561 --> 1:07:06.105
Can't buy it back, not with money,
not with hustling,

1:07:06.188 --> 1:07:07.606
not with none of that shit.

1:07:08.691 --> 1:07:09.608
Okay?

1:07:10.067 --> 1:07:11.861
'Cause it's gone, it's done.

1:07:12.778 --> 1:07:15.072
But you don't gotta be
what they said you were.

1:07:24.457 --> 1:07:28.294
Look at this guy. Look.
With a TV bigger than the apartment.

1:07:28.627 --> 1:07:30.629
Where did he get that TV?

1:07:30.713 --> 1:07:32.882
The TV is bigger than him.

1:07:34.592 --> 1:07:39.305
I'm going to call your PO
and tell him you're dealing drugs!

1:07:48.981 --> 1:07:50.441
<i>We was just out.</i>

1:07:52.401 --> 1:07:53.611
<i>It was a nice night.</i>

1:07:54.403 --> 1:07:55.404
<i>That's all.</i>

1:07:59.241 --> 1:08:00.618
<i>We was just hanging out.</i>

1:08:05.873 --> 1:08:08.459
<i>They say "boys will be boys."</i>

1:08:11.045 --> 1:08:14.340
<i>When they say "boys,"</i>
<i>they not talking about us.</i>

1:08:20.429 --> 1:08:22.473
<i>They talking about other boys</i>

1:08:22.556 --> 1:08:23.724
<i>from other places.</i>

1:08:24.517 --> 1:08:26.644
<i>When did we ever get to be boys?</i>
Down! Get down!

1:08:42.952 --> 1:08:44.954
<i>I can't be something I'm not.</i>

1:08:49.542 --> 1:08:51.001
<i>I ain't a citizen.</i>

1:08:52.586 --> 1:08:54.088
<i>They don't want me to be.</i>

1:08:56.006 --> 1:08:57.466
<i>I don't even want to be.</i>

1:08:58.926 --> 1:09:00.427
<i>I'm somewhere I don't know.</i>

1:09:02.221 --> 1:09:04.431
<i>Half in, half out...</i>

1:09:06.809 --> 1:09:08.310
<i>no matter where I go.</i>

1:09:26.704 --> 1:09:28.080
<i>I'm sorry, Pop.</i>

1:09:30.416 --> 1:09:31.834
You ain't gotta be sorry.

1:09:33.627 --> 1:09:36.589
Hey, look, you tried.
You tried and you know what? You'll...

1:09:37.006 --> 1:09:38.048
You'll try again.

1:09:48.309 --> 1:09:49.435
I gotta go.
