WEBVTT

02:14.132 --> 02:16.967
It's still on, and we're going.

02:16.968 --> 02:20.762
Cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon
to make sure.

02:20.763 --> 02:22.848
Now, Cyrus don't want anybody packed.

02:22.849 --> 02:25.684
He don't want anybody
flexing any muscle.

02:25.685 --> 02:30.685
I gave him my word that the Warriors
would uphold the truce.

02:30.732 --> 02:35.732
Everybody says that Cyrus
is the one and only.

02:36.613 --> 02:41.613
I think we'd better
go have a look for ourself.

03:21.574 --> 03:24.576
- We ain't been to the Bronx before.
- No sweat.

03:24.577 --> 03:26.703
This conclave's gonna be
a real big item.

03:26.704 --> 03:31.704
Every gang in the city is gonna be there.

04:22.635 --> 04:24.386
We're going in there with nothing.

04:24.387 --> 04:26.805
We're going in there
like everybody else.

04:26.806 --> 04:31.806
Nine guys, no weapons.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.641
You got the stuff?

05:11.642 --> 05:13.518
I want you to hit everything in sight.

05:13.519 --> 05:18.519
I want everybody to know
the Warriors were there.

05:51.265 --> 05:53.391
You never know what
you're gonna run into out there.

05:53.392 --> 05:58.392
- Wearing our colors, we can't hide.
- Who wants to hide?

06:31.973 --> 06:34.641
Maybe we'll get to waste a few heads
along the way.

06:34.642 --> 06:39.642
You just soldier
and keep your mouth shut.

06:44.819 --> 06:47.279
When we get there,
you stick close by, okay?

06:47.280 --> 06:50.657
Don't worry.
I don't feel like getting wrecked.

06:50.658 --> 06:54.286
One thing we might get
out of Cyrus' little get-together

06:54.287 --> 06:56.329
is meeting some strange wool.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.957
I wouldn't mind laying something down
on the way back.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.084
You got a one-track brain,
you know that?

07:01.085 --> 07:03.461
What's the matter? You going faggot?

07:03.462 --> 07:05.964
What do you know about Cyrus?

07:05.965 --> 07:08.174
Magic.

07:08.175 --> 07:10.468
A whole lot of magic.

07:10.469 --> 07:14.890
- What do you know about Cyrus?
- He's the one and only.

07:14.891 --> 07:17.225
When you're president
of the biggest gang in the city,

07:17.226 --> 07:19.311
you don't have to take any shit.

07:19.312 --> 07:24.312
Fuck him.

07:32.241 --> 07:37.241
I'll tell you something,
I'll bet nobody's even gonna be there.

08:59.912 --> 09:04.912
Can you count, suckers?

09:05.167 --> 09:10.167
I say the future is ours

09:10.715 --> 09:15.715
if you can count!

09:19.098 --> 09:24.098
- Come on, Cyrus, we're with you!
- Go ahead, bro!

09:27.857 --> 09:31.276
Now, look what we have here before us.

09:31.277 --> 09:33.278
We've got the Saracens

09:33.279 --> 09:36.573
sitting next to the Jones Street Boys.

09:36.574 --> 09:39.117
We've got the Moon Runners

09:39.118 --> 09:43.329
right by the Van Courtland Rangers.

09:43.330 --> 09:47.375
Nobody is wasting nobody.

09:47.376 --> 09:49.419
That

09:49.420 --> 09:52.380
is a miracle.

09:52.381 --> 09:54.340
And miracles

09:54.341 --> 09:56.843
is the way things ought to be.

09:56.844 --> 10:01.056
- Yeah!
- I heard that!

10:01.057 --> 10:06.057
- I heard that.
- Come get answered!

10:07.646 --> 10:12.646
You're standing right now
with nine delegates from 100 gangs.

10:13.778 --> 10:16.404
And there's over 100 more.

10:16.405 --> 10:21.405
That's 20,000 hard-core members.

10:21.660 --> 10:24.329
Forty thousand, counting affiliates,

10:24.330 --> 10:29.330
and 20,000 more,
not organized but ready to fight.

10:30.002 --> 10:35.002
Sixty thousand soldiers.

10:36.217 --> 10:39.677
Now, there ain't but
20,000 police in the whole town.

10:39.678 --> 10:44.349
Can you dig it?

10:44.350 --> 10:49.350
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah!

11:02.827 --> 11:06.037
Now here's the sum total.

11:06.038 --> 11:10.458
One gang could run this city.

11:10.459 --> 11:13.169
One gang-

11:13.170 --> 11:17.173
Nothing would move
without us allowing it to happen.

11:17.174 --> 11:19.676
We could tax the crime syndicates,

11:19.677 --> 11:21.219
the police,

11:21.220 --> 11:24.764
because we got the streets, suckers!

11:24.765 --> 11:29.765
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah!

11:46.495 --> 11:51.495
Right On!

11:56.380 --> 11:58.298
The problem in the past

11:58.299 --> 12:01.885
has been the man
turning us against one another.

12:01.886 --> 12:04.179
We have been unable to see the truth,

12:04.180 --> 12:09.100
because we've been fighting
for 10 square feet of ground,

12:09.101 --> 12:14.101
our turf, our little piece of turf.

12:14.773 --> 12:17.192
That's crap, brothers.

12:17.193 --> 12:19.944
The turf is ours by right

12:19.945 --> 12:24.945
because it's our turn.

12:24.950 --> 12:26.618
All we have to do

12:26.619 --> 12:29.454
is keep up the general truce.

12:29.455 --> 12:33.833
We take over one borough at a time.

12:33.834 --> 12:37.795
Secure our territory.

12:37.796 --> 12:41.549
Secure our turf.

12:41.550 --> 12:46.012
Because it's all our turf.

12:46.013 --> 12:51.013
Yeah!

14:27.364 --> 14:29.407
The other way, against the crowd!

14:29.408 --> 14:31.242
And keep your ass down!

14:31.243 --> 14:36.243
Down!

14:38.667 --> 14:43.667
Get out of the way.

14:52.931 --> 14:57.931
- They'll kill us all.
- Watch out, man. Watch his head.

14:58.771 --> 15:03.771
There wasn't supposed to be no guns!

15:04.860 --> 15:06.194
Come on, move it!

15:06.195 --> 15:07.820
- Is Cleon all right?
- I think he's up there.

15:07.821 --> 15:09.447
- Are you sure?
- No.

15:09.448 --> 15:14.448
Come on! Move it!

15:15.746 --> 15:18.247
There he is! That's him!

15:18.248 --> 15:21.000
That's the Warrior!

15:21.001 --> 15:24.837
- He shot Cyrus!
- Man, you're crazy. I didn't do nothing.

15:24.838 --> 15:27.632
- We saw him!
- Yeah, that's him.

15:27.633 --> 15:31.511
He's the one. He's the one!
The Warriors did it!

15:31.512 --> 15:34.597
The Warriors did it! The Warriors did it!

15:34.598 --> 15:39.598
The Warriors did it!

15:48.237 --> 15:53.237
Kill him!

16:52.009 --> 16:53.801
Down. Everybody down!

16:53.802 --> 16:55.303
- Shit!
- You all right?

16:55.304 --> 17:00.304
Yeah.

17:07.483 --> 17:12.483
Everybody quiet.

17:33.383 --> 17:36.761
Everybody make it?

17:36.762 --> 17:38.429
Just Cleon's missing.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.932
- Fuzz must've got him.
- Did you see him get busted?

17:40.933 --> 17:43.267
I seen him,
then he wasn't there no more.

17:43.268 --> 17:44.769
I was hauling ass.

17:44.770 --> 17:46.896
Why don't you look around,
make sure we're okay.

17:46.897 --> 17:51.897
This is a graveyard.

17:52.110 --> 17:56.656
Okay, what are we gonna do now?

17:56.657 --> 17:59.283
We're going back.

17:59.284 --> 18:00.910
You mind telling us how?

18:00.911 --> 18:03.871
Fucking Coney Island
must be 50 to 100 miles from here.

18:03.872 --> 18:06.958
- It's the only choice we got.
- Yeah, real simple.

18:06.959 --> 18:10.169
Except that every cop in the city
is looking to bust our heads.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.755
- We got something else to think about.
- Yeah? What?

18:12.756 --> 18:14.632
The truce.

18:14.633 --> 18:16.801
Is it still on?

18:16.802 --> 18:21.639
If it ain't, we're gonna have to bop
our way back.

18:21.640 --> 18:26.640
Shit, I wish we was packed.

18:30.691 --> 18:34.527
If this truce is off, anything could
hit us between here and that train.

18:34.528 --> 18:36.404
If you get separated,

18:36.405 --> 18:38.864
make it to the platform at Union Square.

18:38.865 --> 18:43.865
- That's where we change trains.
- I only got one question.

18:47.082 --> 18:51.919
Who named you leader?

18:51.920 --> 18:54.380
I got as much right to take over as you.

18:54.381 --> 18:56.674
It was Cleon's choice. Swan's war chief.

18:56.675 --> 19:01.675
Right about now, Cleon's most likely got
a nightstick shoved halfway up his ass.

19:02.222 --> 19:07.222
Shit.
I bet you can't even find the subway.

19:07.352 --> 19:09.520
Maybe we ought to talk about this
later, huh?

19:09.521 --> 19:12.023
Well, what's wrong with right now?

19:12.024 --> 19:15.026
I wanna be warlord.

19:15.027 --> 19:17.361
Make your move.

19:17.362 --> 19:22.033
- Hey, Ajax, lighten up.
- Big boy, Swan's war chief.

19:22.034 --> 19:26.871
We better stick together.

19:26.872 --> 19:30.041
Hey, you guys!
The train's right over there.

19:30.042 --> 19:34.629
Come on. Hurry up. Let's go!

19:34.630 --> 19:38.966
Let's move.

19:38.967 --> 19:41.260
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
Stay loose.

19:41.261 --> 19:43.888
Fuck.

19:43.889 --> 19:48.889
Rembrandt, mark this spot.

20:02.240 --> 20:07.240
Hey! Wait for me!

20:56.211 --> 20:57.336
Riffs!

20:57.337 --> 21:02.337
Yeah, right!

21:12.644 --> 21:17.644
Who are the Warriors?

21:28.326 --> 21:33.326
There must be some word.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.209
I want them all.

21:37.210 --> 21:39.920
I want all the Warriors!

21:39.921 --> 21:44.133
I want them alive, if possible.
If not, wasted.

21:44.134 --> 21:49.134
But I want them.

21:56.521 --> 22:01.521
Send the word.

22:02.068 --> 22:06.405
All right, now, for all you boppers
out there in the big city,

22:06.406 --> 22:09.241
all you street people
with an ear for the action,

22:09.242 --> 22:13.537
I've been asked to relay a request
from the Gramercy Riffs.

22:13.538 --> 22:15.581
It's a special for the Warriors.

22:15.582 --> 22:18.501
That's that real, live bunch from Coney.

22:18.502 --> 22:21.712
And I do mean the Warriors.

22:21.713 --> 22:26.713
Here's a hit with them in mind.

24:44.356 --> 24:46.565
<i>Be looking good, Warriors.</i>

24:46.566 --> 24:49.318
All the way back to Coney.

24:49.319 --> 24:51.528
You hear me, babies?

24:51.529 --> 24:54.949
Good. Real good.

24:54.950 --> 24:59.950
Adios.

25:06.670 --> 25:11.006
- Come on. What kind of crap is this?
- Yeah. What are we waiting for?

25:11.007 --> 25:12.383
A train would help,

25:12.384 --> 25:15.260
unless you wanna go up there
and get japped on an open platform.

25:15.261 --> 25:17.346
Bullshit, man.
There ain't nobody on the street.

25:17.347 --> 25:22.347
He's right. We're acting like faggots.

25:25.647 --> 25:30.647
Just keep talking.

25:42.330 --> 25:47.330
Move.

25:52.757 --> 25:56.593
That's the Turnbull A.C.'s.

25:56.594 --> 25:58.721
I think they forgot about the truce.

25:58.722 --> 26:01.682
No shit.

26:01.683 --> 26:06.683
Those lousy skinheaded fucks.

26:20.535 --> 26:25.535
That's our train. We gotta make it.

26:27.959 --> 26:32.959
Oh, Jesus Christ!

26:38.595 --> 26:43.595
Are we gonna go for it?

27:33.441 --> 27:38.441
Hold the fucking train!

28:18.278 --> 28:20.571
Those guys were
some desperate dudes.

28:20.572 --> 28:24.950
- So was we!
- In an even fight we could take them.

28:24.951 --> 28:26.618
Bunch of chicken shits!

28:26.619 --> 28:28.996
Those cats didn't look
too chicken shit to me.

28:28.997 --> 28:30.497
Me, neither.

28:30.498 --> 28:35.498
Well, we made it.
And in an hour, it is C.l., the Big Coney.

28:36.754 --> 28:39.548
You got it. Give me that fist, buddy.

28:39.549 --> 28:44.549
When we get there,
that's when we've made it.

28:45.930 --> 28:48.765
Hey, no sweat, war chief.

28:48.766 --> 28:51.059
- Hey! I've got Coney Island!
- Yeah!

28:51.060 --> 28:53.478
Figure out how many stops
to the Union Square?

28:53.479 --> 28:57.608
Hey, come on, man.
That's high math for Rembrandt.

28:57.609 --> 28:59.943
It's all right.
Nobody can read these maps anyway.

28:59.944 --> 29:04.944
Hey, forget it. What's the difference?
We're home free.

29:08.453 --> 29:11.038
We just heard from the Turnbulls.

29:11.039 --> 29:16.039
They blew it.

29:31.809 --> 29:34.478
Shit. This train's had it.

29:34.479 --> 29:36.230
This is fucking impossible.

29:36.231 --> 29:38.982
What the shit are we gonna do?
This sucks.

29:38.983 --> 29:40.734
Why couldn't it rain now?

29:40.735 --> 29:44.655
Maybe we ought to worry about
who set that goddamn fire.

29:44.656 --> 29:49.656
Come on.

30:14.894 --> 30:16.144
Yeah.

30:16.145 --> 30:17.771
How are you?

30:17.772 --> 30:20.607
I was just checking in.

30:20.608 --> 30:23.193
Yeah, it was a real mess up there.

30:23.194 --> 30:28.194
This guy, Cyrus, had an accident.

30:29.450 --> 30:32.452
They did?

30:32.453 --> 30:34.913
Well, that's okay.

30:34.914 --> 30:38.750
These guys, the Warriors.

30:38.751 --> 30:41.378
Yeah, they deserve it.

30:41.379 --> 30:43.797
Yeah, we will.

30:43.798 --> 30:48.798
Take care of yourself.

30:48.928 --> 30:52.389
- We set?
- We're set, all right.

30:52.390 --> 30:54.766
Somebody should pick their ass up.

30:54.767 --> 30:58.603
The Riffs sent out the word.
They want them alive. We don't.

30:58.604 --> 31:00.689
The sooner someone grabs them,
the better.

31:00.690 --> 31:01.857
What's the matter?

31:01.858 --> 31:05.235
You afraid the Warriors gonna shoot
their mouths off before they get racked?

31:05.236 --> 31:06.695
Yeah. Right. I'm worried.

31:06.696 --> 31:09.156
- I just don't want the Riffs on my ass.
- No sweat.

31:09.157 --> 31:14.157
They're looking for the Warriors,
remember?

31:14.329 --> 31:17.164
We can do some looking, too.

31:17.165 --> 31:22.002
Ought to make you feel better.

31:22.003 --> 31:23.337
Hey.

31:23.338 --> 31:28.338
- What about the money you owe?
-For what?

31:47.779 --> 31:51.406
We've had it.

31:51.407 --> 31:52.949
Yeah, I made them.

31:52.950 --> 31:54.576
Two there, one there.

31:54.577 --> 31:57.579
I think they just made us.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.206
You recognize them?

31:59.207 --> 32:00.499
Orphans.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.918
So far down, they ain't even on the map.

32:02.919 --> 32:04.669
Real low-class.

32:04.670 --> 32:07.923
- Numbers?
- Full strength, maybe 30.

32:07.924 --> 32:09.508
Thirty's a lot more than eight.

32:09.509 --> 32:14.509
Not if they're wimps.
And I'm sick of this running crap.

32:17.392 --> 32:22.392
Come on. This way.

32:47.713 --> 32:50.006
Hey.

32:50.007 --> 32:53.176
- You know where that cat's headed.
- Yeah. Reinforcements.

32:53.177 --> 32:58.177
<i>We're gonna get 'yapped here.
We're gonna get 'yapped.</i>

33:02.186 --> 33:04.855
No matter what he says, nobody lip-off.

33:04.856 --> 33:08.567
Nobody get hot.
I'm gonna see what I can do.

33:08.568 --> 33:11.361
- When did you turn into a diplomat?
- Yeah.

33:11.362 --> 33:14.197
You ain't exactly
the State Department type.

33:14.198 --> 33:19.198
Fox, you come with me.

33:24.876 --> 33:29.876
- You ought to show me your invitation.
- How do you figure?

33:30.423 --> 33:34.843
Well, you come armying down here,
invading our territory.

33:34.844 --> 33:37.762
No permits, no parley.

33:37.763 --> 33:40.891
We're not invading.
And I'm parleying right now.

33:40.892 --> 33:43.268
We were just at that big meeting
up in the Bronx.

33:43.269 --> 33:44.728
We're going home to Coney.

33:44.729 --> 33:48.273
The train gets messed up by the fire
and dumps us here.

33:48.274 --> 33:51.693
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

33:51.694 --> 33:54.404
How could this be a big meeting
if the Orphans wasn't there?

33:54.405 --> 33:56.281
You didn't miss anything.
There was a lot of hassle.

33:56.282 --> 33:57.532
A lot of heads got busted.

33:57.533 --> 34:01.620
You think the Orphans ain't with it?
You think we ain't well-known?

34:01.621 --> 34:04.414
- We didn't say that.
- Well, we got a heavy rep.

34:04.415 --> 34:09.415
You mess with us,
and you'll find that out.

34:15.801 --> 34:19.179
You see that?

34:19.179 --> 34:21.931
They write about our raids in the paper.

34:21.933 --> 34:24.893
Yeah.

34:24.893 --> 34:27.103
That's really heavy.

34:27.103 --> 34:28.855
The Orphans, right?

34:28.856 --> 34:32.317
Yeah, our youth worker,
she talks about you guys all the time.

34:32.318 --> 34:35.027
We ain't got one.

34:35.029 --> 34:40.029
That must be because you guys
are so bad, they're afraid of you.

34:47.875 --> 34:50.377
There's nothing wrong with you
making it through our territory,

34:50.378 --> 34:55.378
as long as you're coming in peace.

35:06.060 --> 35:10.146
Cut it, Mercy.

35:10.147 --> 35:12.482
You know what that is, don't you?

35:12.483 --> 35:14.234
Yeah.

35:14.235 --> 35:19.235
Trouble.

35:23.119 --> 35:25.954
Those vests are real nice.

35:25.955 --> 35:27.998
Lighten up, Mercy.
Stop looking for trouble now.

35:27.999 --> 35:30.041
I should've slapped your mouth
the minute you opened it.

35:30.042 --> 35:35.042
So who stopped you?

35:36.632 --> 35:40.677
Come on. Give me one.

35:40.678 --> 35:42.846
Just one.

35:42.847 --> 35:47.847
I just want one vest.
You can get another one, man.

35:48.144 --> 35:53.144
No chance.

35:55.359 --> 35:59.029
Are you just gonna let an army walk
through here any time they feel like it?

35:59.030 --> 36:02.490
- How's it gonna look?
- Get lost.

36:02.491 --> 36:05.827
You know, pretty soon,
every gang is just gonna boogie right in,

36:05.828 --> 36:08.330
soldier right through.

36:08.331 --> 36:13.331
I'll tell you, some man you are.

36:18.466 --> 36:23.466
Take your colors off,
you can walk through.

36:23.846 --> 36:27.223
- We don't do that.
-It's just our mark. it don't mean war.

36:27.224 --> 36:28.558
You go as civilians, okay?

36:28.559 --> 36:30.852
Go as soldiers,
I gotta come down on you.

36:30.853 --> 36:35.106
Now take off your colors.

36:35.107 --> 36:40.107
You hear me?

36:42.281 --> 36:47.281
Fuck you.

36:58.005 --> 37:02.050
We're not gonna hide who we are just
because some whore shakes her ass.

37:02.051 --> 37:04.761
Don't call me no whore.

37:04.762 --> 37:08.056
I ain't no whore!

37:08.057 --> 37:13.057
Let's go.

37:19.110 --> 37:23.738
We're marching to the next station
through these lame fucks' territory.

37:23.739 --> 37:27.409
Now let's move.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.911
Yeah. That's right, Warriors.

37:29.912 --> 37:31.996
Just keep walking.

37:31.997 --> 37:34.916
Real tough mothers, ain't you?

37:34.917 --> 37:37.460
You guys don't show me much.

37:37.461 --> 37:42.461
Why don't you dickheads just walk
all the way back home?

37:44.969 --> 37:49.222
- Boy, that chick's got some mouth.
- You two were really terrific back there.

37:49.223 --> 37:53.518
- You guys let them down, but good.
- His ass gonna be ringing for a month.

37:53.519 --> 37:58.519
- I say we should have wasted them.
- Come on. The station's this way.

39:16.727 --> 39:21.727
Let me go! Let me be.

39:28.823 --> 39:32.283
Okay, what do you got in mind?

39:32.284 --> 39:35.328
Well, maybe I'm looking for
some real action.

39:35.329 --> 39:39.999
Hey, what about me? I got the big one.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.918
I'll give it to you, baby.

39:41.919 --> 39:46.919
Let her go.

39:47.675 --> 39:50.093
You gonna jump me?

39:50.094 --> 39:54.764
Maybe we ought to pull a train on you.
You look like you might even like it.

39:54.765 --> 39:59.765
- Fuck you!
- Real tough chick.

40:12.408 --> 40:14.367
You see what you get, Warriors?

40:14.368 --> 40:19.368
You see what you get
when you mess with the Orphans?

40:25.546 --> 40:30.546
We're gonna rain on you, Warriors!

40:37.600 --> 40:42.600
- Holy shit!
- Now!

40:53.908 --> 40:57.076
- Move, move!
- Where is everybody?

40:57.077 --> 41:02.077
Come on!

41:24.897 --> 41:28.232
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta ask a question.

41:28.233 --> 41:31.903
How come we're running?

41:31.904 --> 41:34.864
I told you, they're a bunch of wimps.

41:34.865 --> 41:37.283
Union Station, here we come.

41:37.284 --> 41:42.284
Hey, what about me?

41:45.042 --> 41:50.042
So, what about you?

41:59.848 --> 42:02.100
We got a report from the Bronx.

42:02.101 --> 42:04.894
Some smalltime clique ran into them.

42:04.895 --> 42:06.396
The Orphans.

42:06.397 --> 42:11.067
- They're not in our network.
- They rumble anyway.

42:11.068 --> 42:16.068
They got wasted.

42:21.036 --> 42:23.997
Okay, let's get down to it, boppers.

42:23.998 --> 42:26.207
We're gonna have to do better
out there.

42:26.208 --> 42:30.128
Our friends just made it past
one of the minor league teams.

42:30.129 --> 42:32.088
<i>Remember, hoppers,</i>

42:32.089 --> 42:35.591
be looking good.

42:35.592 --> 42:39.637
All that's going on?

42:39.638 --> 42:42.098
Right. Great.

42:42.099 --> 42:44.434
Great.

42:44.435 --> 42:49.435
Yeah.

42:52.484 --> 42:53.693
Well?

42:53.694 --> 42:56.946
Some two-bit outfit almost got them,
but they bopped their way past.

42:56.947 --> 43:01.659
- We can meet them at 96th Street.
- The platform's crawling with cops.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.954
Cops are trying to rack up every gang
in this town.

43:04.955 --> 43:09.709
- Me and you included.
- How come you're so happy about this?

43:09.710 --> 43:13.004
I'm having a good time.

43:13.005 --> 43:18.005
- Let's go!
- All right!

43:32.733 --> 43:36.402
How much longer we gotta wait?
We might be here forever.

43:36.403 --> 43:39.072
I'm sick of waiting for trains.

43:39.073 --> 43:42.283
Vermin, sit down and shut up.

43:42.284 --> 43:47.284
Okay, okay.

44:23.742 --> 44:28.742
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?

44:30.082 --> 44:32.375
Hey, hold it!

44:32.376 --> 44:35.670
- Right there.
- Come on.

44:35.671 --> 44:40.671
- Hold it.
- Hey.

44:41.718 --> 44:43.886
Take the uptown.

44:43.887 --> 44:45.930
- Make it! Make it!
- Move!

44:45.931 --> 44:49.976
"Hey! Move! Move!
- Wait up!

44:49.977 --> 44:54.977
- Come back here!
- Hold it!

45:02.364 --> 45:05.241
Let's double back!

45:05.242 --> 45:07.118
- This way!
- No. Come on. Over here.

45:07.119 --> 45:10.580
That way! Go!

45:10.581 --> 45:15.581
- Down the stairs!
- Hurry up.

45:17.004 --> 45:22.004
- The street!
- Far enough, already.

45:22.801 --> 45:25.136
This way.

45:25.137 --> 45:28.014
Oh, shit!

45:28.015 --> 45:29.390
Run!

45:29.391 --> 45:31.392
Just get out of here!

45:31.393 --> 45:34.770
Move!

45:34.771 --> 45:39.771
- God damn you!
- Let go of me!

45:56.126 --> 45:59.462
Where are they?

45:59.463 --> 46:02.965
- Union Square! Union Square!
- What about the others?

46:02.966 --> 46:04.508
We gotta go!

46:04.509 --> 46:09.509
Keep after them! Keep on!

46:38.543 --> 46:41.337
Maybe we'd better take off.

46:41.338 --> 46:46.338
Yeah. Right.

47:09.408 --> 47:13.202
- Did we lose these fucking clowns?
- Look.

47:13.203 --> 47:18.203
Holy shit!

48:19.436 --> 48:24.436
Snow, with me!

48:55.680 --> 49:00.680
Hey!

49:14.950 --> 49:16.992
I can't make it.

49:16.993 --> 49:20.287
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

49:20.288 --> 49:25.288
Good.
I'm sick of running from these wimps.

49:40.475 --> 49:44.603
I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass
and turn you into a Popsicle.

49:44.604 --> 49:49.604
Come on.

50:02.873 --> 50:07.873
- Fucking-A.
- Hey!

51:02.307 --> 51:07.307
Come on, Cowboy.

51:13.151 --> 51:18.151
Shit, I figured they were wimps.

51:19.574 --> 51:22.576
The latest sports news
off the street, boppers.

51:22.577 --> 51:26.330
The Baseball Furies dropped the ball,
made an error.

51:26.331 --> 51:30.876
Our friends are on second base and
trying to make it all the way home.

51:30.877 --> 51:34.588
But the inside word is
that the odds are against them.

51:34.589 --> 51:37.132
<i>Stay tuned, hoppers.</i>

51:37.133 --> 51:42.133
Stay tuned.

52:01.992 --> 52:05.703
- Where is everybody?
- Looks like we're the first ones here.

52:05.704 --> 52:08.664
We're just gonna have to sit and wait.

52:08.665 --> 52:10.666
They'll show up.

52:10.667 --> 52:13.836
Looks like something else showed up.

52:13.837 --> 52:15.671
Well, hey, hey, hey.

52:15.672 --> 52:19.008
Now look at what you find here
in the big city.

52:19.009 --> 52:21.844
- Hey, you guys. We ain't got time.
- Are you kidding?

52:21.845 --> 52:26.845
Time's what we got plenty of.

52:36.276 --> 52:41.276
Hi.

52:53.376 --> 52:58.376
Hey.

53:13.063 --> 53:18.063
Hey.

53:20.570 --> 53:24.365
Hey.

53:24.366 --> 53:27.284
I guess she don't know
that parks ain't safe after dark.

53:27.285 --> 53:29.244
We ain't got time for this right now.

53:29.245 --> 53:32.414
We've got to get to Union Square.

53:32.415 --> 53:36.210
You go ahead if you want.
I'm gonna get a little exercise.

53:36.211 --> 53:39.755
You never were very smart.

53:39.756 --> 53:42.091
I'll tell you something, warlord.

53:42.092 --> 53:43.926
I'm smart enough.

53:43.927 --> 53:45.969
And it's there for free.

53:45.970 --> 53:48.555
You two coming?

53:48.556 --> 53:53.556
- Come on, man.
- There's plenty of women back home.

53:54.437 --> 53:59.437
Maybe all of you just going faggot.

54:13.123 --> 54:15.624
You feeling all right, lady?

54:15.625 --> 54:18.168
You need a little help or something?

54:18.169 --> 54:23.169
Why don't you sit down?
Keep me company.

54:25.135 --> 54:29.388
Whatever you say, lady.

54:29.389 --> 54:31.765
Look at those muscles.

54:31.766 --> 54:36.766
I bet the chicks like all those muscles.

54:44.863 --> 54:48.115
Hey.

54:48.116 --> 54:52.995
We better go back and look out for him.

54:52.996 --> 54:55.164
He saved my ass back there.

54:55.165 --> 54:57.499
I owe him.

54:57.500 --> 55:02.500
Okay, I'll go look for the others.

55:10.805 --> 55:15.684
You wanna show me
how you play with the chicks?

55:15.685 --> 55:18.145
Yeah.

55:18.146 --> 55:21.774
<i>- I'll</i> show you how I play.
- Hey!

55:21.775 --> 55:24.193
Not so rough. Come on.

55:24.194 --> 55:29.194
- We'll get it on.
- You don't get it. I like it rough.

55:40.168 --> 55:43.170
Your nights in the park
are over for a while, honey.

55:43.171 --> 55:45.506
- You're under arrest.
- Hey, lady.

55:45.507 --> 55:47.841
Come on, lady.

55:47.842 --> 55:51.970
Kiss my ass.

55:51.971 --> 55:56.971
Come on, lady.

55:57.560 --> 56:02.560
Come on. Quit playing around.
You don't wanna play around with me!

56:04.901 --> 56:06.902
Let me out of this thing!

56:06.903 --> 56:11.903
You hear me?

56:13.535 --> 56:18.535
God damn it! Let me go!

56:20.250 --> 56:22.876
Let me go!

56:22.877 --> 56:27.877
You can't do this to me!
Come on, you lousy bitch!

56:52.782 --> 56:57.782
Fucking wimp.

57:35.575 --> 57:40.575
Hey, wait!

57:41.164 --> 57:45.667
There's still cops all over the place.

57:45.668 --> 57:47.669
Where's the Fox?

57:47.670 --> 57:50.839
A cop grabbed him.

57:50.840 --> 57:55.510
So how come you hung around?

57:55.511 --> 57:58.555
I don't know.

57:58.556 --> 58:01.683
- Where did you get the coat?
- You ask a lot of questions.

58:01.684 --> 58:06.271
Don't give me that.

58:06.272 --> 58:08.732
I stole it.

58:08.733 --> 58:12.361
Cops are looking for
somebody in a pink top.

58:12.362 --> 58:13.862
Real tough chick.

58:13.863 --> 58:18.241
Right. You said that before.

58:18.242 --> 58:23.163
If you still wanna get to Union Square,
I can show you where to grab the train.

58:23.164 --> 58:24.873
Okay.

58:24.874 --> 58:29.544
Come on.

58:29.545 --> 58:34.545
Hey.

59:20.304 --> 59:25.304
Hey!

59:33.192 --> 59:35.193
- What is that?
- Hold it!

59:35.194 --> 59:37.195
- Freeze!
- Go on.

59:37.196 --> 59:38.572
Move it!

59:38.573 --> 59:40.407
- Jesus!
-Come on!

59:40.408 --> 59:45.408
Run!

01:00:01.637 --> 01:00:04.431
Is this the place?

01:00:04.432 --> 01:00:08.977
Hey, I hate asking the questions,
but where's the dudes?

01:00:08.978 --> 01:00:11.146
Chicks like you
always got dudes around.

01:00:11.147 --> 01:00:14.149
They took the night off.
Went up to the Bronx.

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.068
Don't worry about them.

01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:21.069
They're lame, real cripples.

01:00:29.165 --> 01:00:34.165
Come on.

01:00:34.337 --> 01:00:37.005
When I got off that subway
and I saw you, I thought,

01:00:37.006 --> 01:00:38.924
"Oh, baby, throw it my way."

01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:41.676
I mean, it's really great of you chicks
taking us in like this.

01:00:41.677 --> 01:00:43.970
We know about the Warriors.
You're a heavy outfit.

01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:45.806
Sure, we know you about you guys.

01:00:45.807 --> 01:00:50.560
- How'd you hear about us?
- You know how it is. Word gets around.

01:00:50.561 --> 01:00:55.561
- I guess we are pretty well-known.
- Come on.

01:01:25.346 --> 01:01:28.181
You know, you're the first friendly faces
we've seen all night.

01:01:28.182 --> 01:01:29.766
That's the way we are.

01:01:29.767 --> 01:01:32.394
Let's party a little. Get something going.

01:01:32.395 --> 01:01:37.395
- Yeah, sure. Hey, I can dig that.
- Hey, you came to the right guys.

01:01:39.402 --> 01:01:41.194
Oh, hurt me, hurt me.

01:01:41.195 --> 01:01:44.656
Don't thank us, man. Just relax.

01:01:44.657 --> 01:01:46.533
Fall out.

01:01:46.534 --> 01:01:51.534
Take your pick.

01:01:56.752 --> 01:01:59.254
Thanks. This is a great outfit.

01:01:59.255 --> 01:02:03.091
- What clique is this?
- We're the Lizzies.

01:02:03.092 --> 01:02:05.385
Lizzies. Hey, great.

01:02:05.386 --> 01:02:07.929
Just great. I like that. I like it.

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:12.930
Glad to hear it.

01:02:12.935 --> 01:02:16.229
Man, we got to come
to this part of town more often.

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:20.650
Yeah, right.

01:02:20.651 --> 01:02:25.651
That's right. Got to.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:31.699
Thanks a lot.

01:02:32.205 --> 01:02:37.205
- Looks like you're the winner.
- Yeah, right.

01:02:44.884 --> 01:02:47.928
How much longer
are we gonna hang around here?

01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:51.890
- What's your hurry? We just got here.
- We ought to get to Union Square.

01:02:51.891 --> 01:02:55.602
- They're gonna be worried about us.
- Yeah, sure. In a minute.

01:02:55.603 --> 01:03:00.603
A little break in the action.

01:03:25.841 --> 01:03:27.133
Can we stop for a minute?

01:03:27.134 --> 01:03:30.762
I'm sick of this crap.
My legs are getting tired.

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:34.015
- Come on. Just keep walking.
- Well, what's your hurry?

01:03:34.016 --> 01:03:39.016
Trying to set some kind of
a world record or something?

01:03:42.733 --> 01:03:47.733
Hey.

01:03:49.699 --> 01:03:52.492
- Just walk.
- I'm walking.

01:03:52.493 --> 01:03:56.705
Jesus, why don't you give me a break?

01:03:56.706 --> 01:04:00.208
Be a little friendly.
I don't even know your name.

01:04:00.209 --> 01:04:03.044
My name's Swan.

01:04:03.045 --> 01:04:05.880
What do you care about names
so much for?

01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:08.925
I like telling my friends
I been with somebody particular.

01:04:08.926 --> 01:04:10.802
You know what I mean?

01:04:10.803 --> 01:04:14.806
Why don't you just tie a mattress
to your back?

01:04:14.807 --> 01:04:17.809
You don't care where it is, do you?

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:22.063
Look, what do you got against me?
You've been picking on me all night.

01:04:22.064 --> 01:04:24.232
You want me to tell you the truth?

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:26.026
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

01:04:26.027 --> 01:04:28.987
I don't like the way you live.

01:04:28.988 --> 01:04:31.156
- The way I live?
- Yeah.

01:04:31.157 --> 01:04:34.659
I keep hoping I'm gonna
run into something a little better.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.329
What kind of crap is this?

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:39.539
Who are you?
You ain't any better than me.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.916
I guess you like the way
everything's going for you.

01:04:41.917 --> 01:04:43.752
Well, maybe I do.

01:04:43.753 --> 01:04:47.130
Friday nights are pretty good.
Saturday nights are better.

01:04:47.131 --> 01:04:50.592
I don't think you can remember who
you get on Friday and Saturday night.

01:04:50.593 --> 01:04:52.927
I don't think you can remember
what they look like.

01:04:52.928 --> 01:04:55.972
Sometimes I can,
and sometimes I can't.

01:04:55.973 --> 01:04:59.517
Who gives a damn?

01:04:59.518 --> 01:05:02.604
I see what's happening next door
and down the block,

01:05:02.605 --> 01:05:05.565
belly hanging down, five kids,

01:05:05.566 --> 01:05:09.277
cockroaches in the cupboard.

01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:12.238
I'll tell you what I want.

01:05:12.239 --> 01:05:14.866
I want something now.

01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:19.704
This is the life I got left.
You know what I mean?

01:05:19.705 --> 01:05:23.375
You get it, Warrior?

01:05:23.376 --> 01:05:28.376
Get it?

01:05:41.977 --> 01:05:46.977
How do you like it?

01:06:27.648 --> 01:06:29.774
Come on. What's wrong?

01:06:29.775 --> 01:06:33.736
Let's just get to the next station, okay?

01:06:33.737 --> 01:06:35.113
No.

01:06:35.114 --> 01:06:36.823
Please?

01:06:36.824 --> 01:06:38.658
Come on.

01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:41.536
Come on.

01:06:41.537 --> 01:06:46.537
You're just part of everything that's
happening tonight, and it's all bad.

01:06:50.087 --> 01:06:55.087
Just go back
to wherever it was you came from.

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:44.970
Hey, little man, you wanna dance?

01:08:19.885 --> 01:08:24.885
I'll be right with you, babe.

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:40.529
So you're the famous Warriors,
the guys that shot Cyrus.

01:08:40.531 --> 01:08:44.576
Shit! The chicks are packed.
The chicks are packed!

01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:49.577
Shit!

01:09:13.397 --> 01:09:18.397
Shit.

01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:31.497
She cut me. She cut me.

01:09:31.497 --> 01:09:33.041
Look. Look, man.

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:36.711
Now we gotta hold ourselves together.
We got to.

01:09:36.712 --> 01:09:41.174
See, man, now if we go to pieces,
somebody out there's gonna get us.

01:09:41.175 --> 01:09:43.718
They think we shot Cyrus.

01:09:43.719 --> 01:09:45.511
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:47.263
They think we shot Cyrus.

01:09:47.264 --> 01:09:50.015
Every gang in this city
must be looking for us.

01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:52.352
Holy shit!

01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:55.438
We're not gonna be able
to make it back.

01:09:55.439 --> 01:09:57.106
We're gonna make it back.

01:09:57.107 --> 01:09:59.859
We came this far.
We'll go the rest of the way.

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:04.860
Let's go to Union Square, okay?
We gotta tell the rest of the guys.

01:12:18.916 --> 01:12:21.250
Hey.

01:12:21.251 --> 01:12:25.421
Where's the rest of them?

01:12:25.422 --> 01:12:30.422
Yeah, right.

01:12:34.264 --> 01:12:36.390
Where's everybody else?

01:12:36.391 --> 01:12:40.311
Cops got Ajax.
We don't know about Swan.

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:44.232
- Oh, Jesus!
- Are you sure about Ajax?

01:12:44.233 --> 01:12:47.235
Real sure.

01:12:47.236 --> 01:12:49.904
I bet he went out swinging.

01:12:49.905 --> 01:12:54.742
We better go look for Swan.

01:12:54.743 --> 01:12:57.328
God, I can't believe it.

01:12:57.329 --> 01:13:02.329
Yeah. What is this shit?

01:13:24.273 --> 01:13:27.441
I need to talk to you.

01:13:27.442 --> 01:13:32.442
See that dude over there
with the skates?

01:13:32.447 --> 01:13:34.532
Over there.

01:13:34.533 --> 01:13:39.533
He's after you.
And he's got some guys with him.

01:13:40.664 --> 01:13:45.664
I know they're on my ass.

01:13:47.796 --> 01:13:51.299
But now they know I know it.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:56.300
Well, what are you gonna do?

01:14:28.337 --> 01:14:30.212
Come on.

01:14:30.213 --> 01:14:33.341
You sure change your mind fast.

01:14:33.342 --> 01:14:37.178
- I was kind of rough on you back there.
- Listen, I can take care of myself.

01:14:37.179 --> 01:14:42.179
Sure. Come on.

01:14:47.522 --> 01:14:50.191
Wait a minute. I can't go in there.

01:14:50.192 --> 01:14:53.069
It's a men's room.

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:58.070
Are you kidding?

01:16:44.097 --> 01:16:49.097
Get him!

01:18:19.943 --> 01:18:24.943
- What about our patrols?
- So far, nothing.

01:18:25.198 --> 01:18:28.117
But we've got somebody here
you ought to talk to.

01:18:28.118 --> 01:18:33.118
He says he saw who shot Cyrus.

01:18:49.598 --> 01:18:53.517
Big Cyrus, he was gonna
run the whole city.

01:18:53.518 --> 01:18:56.187
What crap that was.

01:18:56.188 --> 01:18:59.315
Cyrus was right about one thing.

01:18:59.316 --> 01:19:02.109
It's all out there.

01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:05.404
All we gotta do is just
figure out a way to go steal it.

01:19:05.405 --> 01:19:06.864
Sounds great.

01:19:06.865 --> 01:19:11.865
All you gotta do is figure out
what's worth stealing.

01:19:35.894 --> 01:19:40.147
Okay, come on. Let's go.

01:19:40.148 --> 01:19:45.148
Come on, let me get some breakfast
or something.

01:20:51.469 --> 01:20:56.469
- Let's get off here.
- Yeah.

01:22:09.881 --> 01:22:12.591
What's this for?

01:22:12.592 --> 01:22:17.592
I just hate seeing anything go to waste.

01:22:25.939 --> 01:22:30.939
This is what we fought all night
to get back to?

01:22:31.986 --> 01:22:35.489
Maybe I'll just take off.

01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:39.034
Well, you know I like traveling, too.

01:22:39.035 --> 01:22:42.371
Where have you ever been?

01:22:42.372 --> 01:22:44.415
I never been anywhere.

01:22:44.416 --> 01:22:49.416
I just know I'd like it.

01:22:50.046 --> 01:22:55.046
Come on. Let's go.

01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:36.629
Stay right on their ass.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:56.570
Wait a couple seconds after we move,
then cut out the other way.

01:23:56.571 --> 01:23:59.364
- Why can't I stay with you?
- Just do what I tell you.

01:23:59.365 --> 01:24:01.742
- Okay?
- Come on.

01:24:01.743 --> 01:24:04.411
I can take care of myself.

01:24:04.412 --> 01:24:07.956
I proved that.

01:24:07.957 --> 01:24:12.957
Come on.

01:25:05.807 --> 01:25:08.016
Warriors.

01:25:08.017 --> 01:25:12.396
Come out to play.

01:25:12.397 --> 01:25:15.440
Warriors.

01:25:15.441 --> 01:25:20.441
Come out to play.

01:25:20.989 --> 01:25:23.031
Warriors.

01:25:23.032 --> 01:25:27.619
Come out to play.

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:29.663
Warriors.

01:25:29.664 --> 01:25:34.167
Come out to play.

01:25:34.168 --> 01:25:36.044
Warriors.

01:25:36.045 --> 01:25:41.045
Come out to play!

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.887
Everybody packed?

01:25:45.888 --> 01:25:48.682
Yeah.

01:25:48.683 --> 01:25:53.061
All of you stay behind me.
I'm gonna take them out to the sand.

01:25:53.062 --> 01:25:58.062
What about you? You ready?

01:25:59.694 --> 01:26:04.694
Let's do it.

01:27:08.638 --> 01:27:13.638
When we see the ocean,
we figure we're home, we're safe.

01:27:13.726 --> 01:27:18.726
This time, you got it wrong.

01:27:19.607 --> 01:27:21.733
Why did you do it?

01:27:21.734 --> 01:27:24.111
Why did you waste Cyrus?

01:27:24.112 --> 01:27:26.947
No reason.

01:27:26.948 --> 01:27:31.948
I just like doing things like that.

01:27:36.374 --> 01:27:39.751
Let's do it, me and you.

01:27:39.752 --> 01:27:42.129
One on one?

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:47.130
You're crazy.

01:27:47.301 --> 01:27:49.386
You're dead.

01:27:49.387 --> 01:27:53.849
All of you, and you know it.

01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:58.850
- You're dead.
- Swan!

01:28:23.838 --> 01:28:28.838
- Riffs!
- Yeah, right!

01:28:54.952 --> 01:28:59.331
You still looking for us?

01:28:59.332 --> 01:29:03.210
We found what we're looking for.

01:29:03.211 --> 01:29:07.547
No.

01:29:07.548 --> 01:29:09.674
It wasn't us.

01:29:09.675 --> 01:29:13.929
It was them, the Warriors.

01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:17.098
You Warriors are good.

01:29:17.099 --> 01:29:21.144
Real good.

01:29:21.145 --> 01:29:24.022
The best.

01:29:24.023 --> 01:29:29.023
The rest is ours.

01:29:55.763 --> 01:30:00.763
No!

01:30:01.644 --> 01:30:05.564
Good news, boppers.
The big alert has been called off.

01:30:05.565 --> 01:30:10.277
It turns out that the early reports
were wrong, all wrong.

01:30:10.278 --> 01:30:14.781
Now for that group out there
that had such a hard time getting home,

01:30:14.782 --> 01:30:16.783
sorry about that.

01:30:16.784 --> 01:30:21.784
I guess the only thing we can do
is play you a song.
