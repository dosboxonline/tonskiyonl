WEBVTT

00:58.200 --> 00:59.520
The men are waiting.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.340
Are you ready?

01:01.960 --> 01:03.530
I have the transmitter.

01:03.625 --> 01:06.035
Remember, our priority is 
saving the people.

01:08.521 --> 01:10.401
It's okay.

01:10.921 --> 01:12.041
Don't worry?

01:12.200 --> 01:13.470
I don't want you to go.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.020
I know, but I have to help them

01:15.040 --> 01:17.120
them find our friends at the ski resort.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.320
You understand?

01:19.640 --> 01:20.630
Don't go.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.361
I have to.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.321
I need you to be brave for me.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.780
Can you do that?

01:32.320 --> 01:33.060
Yeah.

01:33.550 --> 01:34.050
Okay.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.230
Don't worry, okay?

01:37.440 --> 01:38.900
I'll come back soon.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.450
Has Emily said anything about
what happened?

03:13.200 --> 03:14.870
Just that one of those things 
attacked them.

03:17.080 --> 03:17.940
What was she doing

03:17.960 --> 03:20.160
wandering around without telling anyone?

03:20.521 --> 03:22.281
Well, she said she heard something.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.070
What? And she...

03:24.570 --> 03:26.200
didn't wake anyone up?

03:28.481 --> 03:29.681
What are you saying?

03:29.840 --> 03:30.840
She's your daughter.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.080
I can get it.

03:32.441 --> 03:34.801
But Helen's dead, and...

03:35.201 --> 03:36.721
We need to find out
what went down.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.270
You think it's her fault?

03:38.330 --> 03:40.120
Are you certain it's not?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.450
What's going on with her

03:41.470 --> 03:42.840
and those things?

03:43.441 --> 03:44.881
Who's next?

03:45.160 --> 03:47.100
You? Me?...Tom?

03:47.500 --> 03:48.990
We can't just sit on our asses.

03:49.030 --> 03:50.850
Stay the fuck away from her!

03:55.840 --> 03:57.000
Just 'cause you don't 
want to hear it

03:57.020 --> 03:58.960
doesn't mean I'm not right.

04:58.886 --> 05:01.556
Nathan, get their dog tags.

05:05.804 --> 05:07.054
Their dog tags...

05:13.670 --> 05:15.160
Those are the missing men who
deserted the observatory.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.241
You think he's heading into town?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.481
Yes, maybe.

05:41.801 --> 05:44.041
What you said about Noah is true,

05:45.241 --> 05:46.561
isn't it?

05:48.860 --> 05:49.920
Aha.

05:57.601 --> 05:59.801
He should never have been born.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.890
I've tried to protect him

06:03.910 --> 06:05.400
from  the truth, but...

06:07.521 --> 06:09.921
I see his father in his eyes.

06:11.161 --> 06:13.241
And I hate him for it.

06:16.081 --> 06:18.121
He's so like him.

06:26.681 --> 06:27.801
Noah.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.081
He raped me.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.481
He's Sacha's father.

06:39.321 --> 06:40.841
Does Sacha know?

06:43.921 --> 06:45.321
I don't know.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.610
What are you going?

07:30.920 --> 07:31.740
Emily?

07:31.780 --> 07:33.040
I want to be on my own.

07:33.910 --> 07:36.160
Maybe it's better if you stay here?

07:36.761 --> 07:37.961
Why?

07:38.761 --> 07:40.601
I just think it's better.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.800
You don't trust me now?

07:42.840 --> 07:43.860
Of course, I do.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.790
You think it's my fault!

07:45.810 --> 07:46.680
No!

07:46.841 --> 07:48.601
You're such a shit liar, Mum!

07:48.960 --> 07:49.790
Emily, stop!

07:49.810 --> 07:50.800
Just...just stop!

07:50.960 --> 07:52.120
What?

07:52.420 --> 07:53.800
What do you want me to say?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.321
They killed Helen!

07:55.481 --> 07:56.841
Not me!

07:57.201 --> 07:58.481
Dad...

07:58.641 --> 07:59.721
Helen...

07:59.880 --> 08:01.150
All of my friends.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.210
They did this!

08:02.270 --> 08:03.440
I know.

08:03.470 --> 08:05.210
So why does it feel like it's my fault?

08:05.230 --> 08:06.830
Of course, it's not your fault.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.400
Why is this happening to me?

08:11.201 --> 08:12.481
I don't know, Love.

08:18.090 --> 08:18.660
Emily!

08:18.680 --> 08:20.600
You can't help me now.

08:22.241 --> 08:23.961
Just leave me alone.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.960
It looks abandoned.

08:50.490 --> 08:51.430
They're hiding.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.600
They only come out when they need to.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.420
Where's Theo?

09:41.450 --> 09:42.560
At the observatory.

09:42.610 --> 09:43.400
At the observatory. He's safe.

09:43.470 --> 09:45.380
Innes, this is my sister,

09:45.490 --> 09:47.160
Catherine and Colonely Mokrani.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.481
We were starting to give up hope.

09:49.721 --> 09:50.641
Thank you.

09:50.961 --> 09:51.961
Come.

09:52.817 --> 09:54.407
We're going inside.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.510
Hand out the food and water.

10:22.730 --> 10:24.450
And look after the wounded.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.110
Get your people ready.

10:30.140 --> 10:31.680
We're leaving in 2 hours.

11:11.721 --> 11:13.361
I was engaged.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.100
Hayley.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.770
My God, she was beautiful.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.190
I had to work my ass of

11:25.220 --> 11:26.880
just just to get her details.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.940
Yeah, she made me beg.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.720
She knew what she was doing.

11:37.521 --> 11:40.001
She could twist me around
her little finger.

11:42.241 --> 11:44.121
Five foot nothing.

11:47.201 --> 11:49.841
She had me right under her thumb.

11:53.721 --> 11:55.721
She didn't take shit from anyone.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.480
I loved that about her.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.450
When she was at home,

12:06.480 --> 12:07.960
just me and her, she was...

12:08.641 --> 12:10.401
like this gentle little girl.

12:10.561 --> 12:13.001
She was always crying at stuff on TV.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.161
She was my whole world.

12:23.761 --> 12:25.561
I would've done anything for her.

12:36.001 --> 12:37.401
She was pregnant.

12:42.450 --> 12:44.320
We were going to be a family.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.770
I was the happiest man alive.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.000
Are you going somewhere?

14:14.340 --> 14:16.440
She was coming back to me...

14:18.001 --> 14:19.841
and I fucking blew it!

14:21.930 --> 14:24.280
I won't get another chance!

17:38.290 --> 17:39.220
Wait.

18:06.081 --> 18:07.961
I know what I have to do.

18:10.681 --> 18:12.281
I have to go to them.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.280
It's the only way to find out why

18:14.300 --> 18:15.190
this is happening to me.

18:15.201 --> 18:16.601
It's too dangerous.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.760
I won't let you.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.550
They won't hurt me.

18:18.570 --> 18:19.640
You don't know that.

18:19.710 --> 18:21.240
They want my help.

18:22.081 --> 18:23.721
They want your help?

18:24.001 --> 18:24.841
How?

18:25.201 --> 18:26.801
They want to live.

18:27.681 --> 18:29.081
You think you will find answers?

18:29.801 --> 18:31.601
You will only get yourself killed.

18:31.921 --> 18:33.601
I have to know.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.230
I'll come with you.

18:36.250 --> 18:36.610
No.

18:36.940 --> 18:37.890
Either I come with you

18:37.910 --> 18:39.440
or I don't let you go.

18:45.170 --> 18:46.960
You know how to find them?

20:45.521 --> 20:47.121
ChloÃ©, in there!

22:19.005 --> 22:19.955
Mum!

22:20.390 --> 22:21.450
Sacha!

22:21.710 --> 22:22.560
Sacha!

22:32.133 --> 22:33.043
I'm so sorry.

22:37.780 --> 22:39.080
I'm ashamed.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.130
Don't worry...don't worry.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.240
It doesn't matter.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.350
Why so many sweets?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.650
For when the children are afraid.

23:26.570 --> 23:27.830
I'm proud of you.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.800
It's taking me to them.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.560
You know about Noah, don't you?

24:36.590 --> 24:38.630
I heard you speaking at Grandma's.

24:42.030 --> 24:43.990
You shouldn't have found out that way.

24:45.755 --> 24:46.445
Sorry.

24:49.653 --> 24:50.843
He was a bastard.

24:58.270 --> 24:59.790
Why didn't you help him?

25:02.550 --> 25:03.590
I did it for you...

25:05.250 --> 25:06.710
I wanted him to suffer.

25:09.620 --> 25:11.860
Now he can't hurt you any more.

25:29.780 --> 25:31.210
Forgive me.

25:34.890 --> 25:36.570
That I was born?

25:37.510 --> 25:38.200
No.

25:39.030 --> 25:40.250
I don't know.

25:40.450 --> 25:41.440
The way you look at me sometimes...

25:41.460 --> 25:42.160
No.

25:42.470 --> 25:45.440
You told Noah it's terrible

25:45.490 --> 25:48.430
that I look like him.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.210
That's not true.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.410
I heard you say it.

25:50.510 --> 25:52.490
I didn't mean it like that.

25:59.788 --> 26:01.318
What happened to me ...

26:04.240 --> 26:05.580
was terrible.

26:09.475 --> 26:12.035
But you mean everything to me.

26:16.817 --> 26:17.867
It's true.

26:25.530 --> 26:27.400
The thoughts in my head...

26:27.450 --> 26:29.360
the nastiest things.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.980
You know that I love you.

26:47.820 --> 26:48.920
I'm so sorry.

26:49.710 --> 26:50.960
I love you so much.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.150
That was really close.

26:58.170 --> 26:59.450
Stay away from the windows.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.841
<i>Mum</i>

28:16.150 --> 28:18.520
So you're sure you want
to stay in France?

28:18.681 --> 28:20.001
I have to.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.081
I have to do what's best for Sacha.

28:24.281 --> 28:25.201
No.

28:25.641 --> 28:27.441
We should go to England.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.460
I want to help you...

28:32.490 --> 28:33.520
find your family.

28:34.361 --> 28:35.601
I just want to help.

30:11.150 --> 30:12.340
Are they ready?

30:12.450 --> 30:13.150
Yes.

30:18.470 --> 30:19.670
Everyone ready?

30:20.400 --> 30:22.000
Keep quiet.

30:22.130 --> 30:23.370
Wait for my signal.

30:23.370 --> 30:24.480
It'll be okay.

30:30.140 --> 30:31.510
I want to thank you.

30:31.970 --> 30:32.640
Why?

30:32.980 --> 30:34.840
If you had not been there...

30:45.306 --> 30:47.396
Close the doors! Quickly!

30:49.937 --> 30:51.607
Secure them!

30:53.730 --> 30:55.200
Quickly! Everyone in position!

31:02.600 --> 31:03.270
Catherine!

31:03.300 --> 31:04.300
Sophia!

31:17.470 --> 31:18.670
Take cover!

31:21.048 --> 31:22.238
They are too many!

31:25.480 --> 31:26.670
He's dead.

31:26.690 --> 31:27.840
We have to save everyone!

31:27.900 --> 31:29.320
Take cover.

31:33.450 --> 31:34.870
Hold your position!

31:34.900 --> 31:35.820
Sophia!!

31:51.208 --> 31:52.718
Fall back!
Fall back!

32:02.680 --> 32:03.780
Sofia!!

32:37.640 --> 32:39.480
What are you doing?

32:39.690 --> 32:41.700
I might be able to stop them!

32:42.170 --> 32:43.620
It'll only take a second.

32:48.871 --> 32:50.451
Catherine, hurry!

32:51.537 --> 32:53.197
We can't hold them off!

33:06.920 --> 33:08.360
I'm looking for the signal!

33:16.120 --> 33:17.040
Last clip!

33:39.650 --> 33:40.770
Hurry up!

33:41.600 --> 33:43.230
Almost there...

33:43.550 --> 33:45.060
I'm isolating the signal.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.140
Catherine! It's now or never!

34:11.110 --> 34:12.290
Yes!

34:27.889 --> 34:29.000
It's working!

34:31.900 --> 34:33.520
They're blind.

35:17.521 --> 35:20.001
Better to have loved and lost...

35:20.601 --> 35:21.961
they say.

35:24.281 --> 35:25.601
Bullshit.

35:35.641 --> 35:37.081
Kariem's with her.

35:38.921 --> 35:40.201
He'll keep her safe.

35:47.281 --> 35:48.721
She'll come back.

35:57.921 --> 35:59.361
You don't know that.

36:20.601 --> 36:22.921
People don't always come back.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.080
Your Dad's probably...

36:32.240 --> 36:34.280
is probably dead.

36:38.441 --> 36:40.481
I can't keep lying to you.

36:42.140 --> 36:43.220
I'm sorry.

36:45.881 --> 36:47.001
I know.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.203
You were right.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.750
That was a breakthrough.

40:02.690 --> 40:04.360
If you want we can be friends now.

40:05.950 --> 40:07.920
Let's just forget about it, okay?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.720
Tell me about your family.

41:13.921 --> 41:14.921
What are you doing?

41:15.641 --> 41:17.041
I have to know.
