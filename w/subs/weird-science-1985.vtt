00:29.905 --> 00:32.365
This is so beautiful.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.451
WYATT: You know it, Gary.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.079
Look at her.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.548
Do you know what I
would like to do?

00:48.632 --> 00:50.550
Shower with them.

00:51.009 --> 00:55.138
Then bang!
We hit the city,
baby, dead on.

00:56.348 --> 01:00.226
For little drinks,
a little nightlife,
a little dancing.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.352
Dancing.

01:01.437 --> 01:04.522
We throw a huge party,
I mean, huge party.

01:04.605 --> 01:08.568
Everybody's invited,
women everywhere.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.821
All these girls,
they're all there.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.198
Naked bodies everywhere.
Gary.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.742
They all know my name.
Gary.

01:15.826 --> 01:16.868
What?

01:16.952 --> 01:19.996
Nobody likes us. Nobody.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.624
Why are you messing
with the fantasy?

01:24.126 --> 01:26.043
We know about the reality.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.337
Don't ruin the fantasy, okay?

01:29.840 --> 01:32.258
And then, we're a hit, man.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.427
We're popular. We're revered.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.888
Man, we're studs.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.973
(SNIGGERS)

01:39.057 --> 01:42.185
When the smoke clears, right,

01:44.271 --> 01:46.355
those two dames

01:46.440 --> 01:50.985
fall amazingly, completely
and totally in love
with us, Wyatt.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.863
Check it out.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.493
IAN: Yo! Check this out.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

03:46.476 --> 03:48.561
MAN ON TV:
His insane ambition
to create life.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.897
Where'd your
parents go, anyway?

03:50.981 --> 03:52.523
Cincinnati.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.026
They're meeting the guy
that my sister
wants to marry.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.280
Chloe? Who the hell
would marry Chloe?

03:59.698 --> 04:01.699
He's studying to be a vet.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.577
WYATT: Try not to make
a mess in there, Gary.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.245
The maid doesn't
come till Monday.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.413
You know, I don't
understand something, Wyatt.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.248
How come all of a sudden
your parents trust you, man?

04:09.333 --> 04:11.083
They never let
you do shit before.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.460
Chet's coming
home from college

04:12.544 --> 04:14.337
for the weekend.
They trust him.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.922
He's in charge.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.466
GARY: Chet? Shit!

04:19.343 --> 04:21.260
You know,
I can't believe this, Wyatt.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.179
I really wish
that you told me this

04:23.263 --> 04:24.555
before I agreed
to sleep over.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.349
You know how I
feel about Chet.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.892
GARY: I mean, how do you
put up with that guy?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.186
If I don't,
he beats the shit out of me.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.229
It's a habit he picked
up in military school.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.481
GARY: I mean, how do you
put up with that putz?

04:33.565 --> 04:36.484
WYATT: What can I say, Gary?
He's very protective of me.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.235
Nice relationship.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.197
MAN ON TV:
There you have his mad dream.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.036
Look!
There's nothing to fear.

04:47.120 --> 04:53.376
Look, no blood, no decay,
just a few stitches.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.795
Go on. Fix the electrodes.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.923
You'll have
plenty to be afraid of
before the night's over.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.592
The storm will
be magnificent.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.595
All the electrical
secrets of heaven.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.224
And this time we're ready.
Hey, Fritz?

05:08.558 --> 05:11.268
Let's have one final test.
Throw the switches.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.396
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

05:15.565 --> 05:19.276
Here in this machine,
I have discovered
the great ray

05:19.361 --> 05:22.363
that first brought
life into the world.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.949
And, look,
here's the final touch.

05:27.786 --> 05:31.455
The brain you stole, Fritz.
Think of it.

05:31.540 --> 05:36.127
The brain of a dead man
waiting to live again
in a body I made

05:36.211 --> 05:38.087
with my own hands.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.339
You know,
that's not a bad idea.

05:40.424 --> 05:41.507
WYATT: What?

05:41.591 --> 05:43.509
In 15 minutes,
the storm should
be at its height.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.094
Making a girl.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.975
Actually making a girl.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.645
Just like Frankenstein,

05:55.313 --> 05:56.564
except cuter.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.357
Nobody must come here!

05:58.442 --> 06:00.443
Don't touch it!

06:00.527 --> 06:02.028
I'm sorry, Doctor.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.321
You're serious.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.656
Yes.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.286
Look me in the eyes.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.288
Do I look serious?

06:12.664 --> 06:13.873
MAN: You're crazy!

06:13.957 --> 06:15.708
Crazy, am I?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.502
We'll see whether
I'm crazy or not.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.672
Gary Wallace,
that's absolutely gross.

06:21.757 --> 06:22.757
That's sick.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.426
I'm not digging up
dead girls. It's...

06:28.096 --> 06:31.849
No, I'm not
talking about digging up
a dead girl, Wyatt.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.100
I'm talking about
your system, idiot.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.685
Your computer.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.021
Okay, look,
you know how you're
always talking about

06:37.105 --> 06:40.900
how you can simulate
all that stuff on
your computer? You know?

06:40.984 --> 06:43.903
What's the difference?
Why can't we simulate a girl?

06:43.987 --> 06:47.114
I don't know.
I guess I could, but why?

06:47.199 --> 06:48.908
It's two-dimensional
on the screen.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.951
It's not flesh
and blood, Gary.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.120
I know that, but, you know,
we can use it, Wyatt.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.246
We can ask it questions.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.583
We can put it in
real-life sexual situations
and see how it reacts.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.377
Like real sick,
demented shit.
You'd love it.

07:00.462 --> 07:03.464
Well, what about
your girl in Canada?

07:05.050 --> 07:06.675
She lives in Canada.
This girl has no morals.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.260
You know,
I don't like that in a girl.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.096
It's rough having
those kind of relationships.
You'll see.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.222
(CLEARING THROAT)

07:11.306 --> 07:12.598
Anyway, get to work.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.522
Very nice.

07:24.528 --> 07:28.114
Hold it, Wyatt. I mean,
if there's one thing I know,
it's female stats.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.782
I mean, anything
bigger than a handful,

07:29.866 --> 07:31.117
you're risking
a sprained tongue.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.701
You know, and...

07:33.078 --> 07:34.537
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.706
Perfect.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.000
Okay. Now what?

07:41.211 --> 07:43.379
Should we give her
a brain?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.631
Yeah.
We can play chess with her.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.882
Chess?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.426
Just give her
a brain, okay?

07:58.228 --> 08:01.772
Okay,
that's about all we can do
with my stuff.

08:01.857 --> 08:05.109
I can't believe this shit.
I can't believe this.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.361
Did you get a free
toaster with this, too?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.780
Gary, it's smarter
than you, okay?

08:09.865 --> 08:12.158
The problem is,
this is a lame idea, okay?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.160
It's not a lame idea.
The problem is
your computer's a wimp

08:14.244 --> 08:15.995
and we need a lot
more power than this.
That's the problem.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.329
What do you suggest?

08:21.042 --> 08:23.085
VOICE: We have code
penetration, we have
program entry.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.921
I repeat, we have
code penetration,
we have program entry.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.932
Activate lang trace.

08:51.907 --> 08:55.409
(SCREAMING)

09:14.554 --> 09:15.888
We're in.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.890
We're in trouble, Gary.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.059
This is highly illegal.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.187
Well, you need more input.
We got to fill this
thing up with data.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.940
We gotta make her
as real as possible, Wyatt.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.817
I want her to live,
I want her to breathe.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.986
I want her to aerobicize.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.191
It's live!
All Dave, all night!

10:09.651 --> 10:15.197
We know what you need
only right here on Dave TV!

10:16.741 --> 10:19.535
Look at this.
It's moving, it's working.
It's doing itself.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.995
It's working by itself.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.592
(CHANTING)

10:40.807 --> 10:42.057
Gary...

10:42.517 --> 10:44.893
(HUMMING)

10:44.978 --> 10:48.063
By the way,
why are we wearing
bras on our heads?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.149
Ceremonial.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.993
You ready?
Yeah.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.369
Let's go.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.248
GARY: Turn it off!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.958
WYATT: It is off!

11:11.254 --> 11:12.463
(ALARM RINGING)

11:13.089 --> 11:14.965
Hang up the phone!

11:24.809 --> 11:25.893
Wyatt, what's going on?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.269
I don't know!

11:27.354 --> 11:28.354
Well, unplug it!

11:28.438 --> 11:29.563
Okay!

11:33.818 --> 11:35.194
Oh, shit!

11:47.957 --> 11:50.334
No! It was a birthday present!

11:54.631 --> 11:56.173
Oh, shit!

11:58.134 --> 11:59.676
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

11:59.761 --> 12:01.261
Oh, shit!

12:01.346 --> 12:03.055
We got to get this thing
out of your house!

12:03.139 --> 12:04.723
You get it out!
It was your idea!

12:04.808 --> 12:06.892
This is all your fault!

12:06.976 --> 12:08.102
Hit the lights out!
You get it out!

12:08.186 --> 12:09.311
You get it out!

12:09.396 --> 12:10.979
I'll get it out!

12:22.909 --> 12:25.911
(DOOR CREAKING)

12:33.461 --> 12:36.004
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

12:37.090 --> 12:38.966
WYATT: Shit!

13:09.747 --> 13:11.582
One, two, three.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.212
She's alive. Alive!

13:18.715 --> 13:20.841
(EXCLAIMING)

13:23.845 --> 13:25.012
So,

13:25.805 --> 13:28.891
what would you little maniacs
like to do first?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.564
You guys created me.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.816
I didn't come from anywhere.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.402
WOMAN: Before you
started messing around
with your computer,

13:40.487 --> 13:42.279
I didn't even exist.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.450
By the way,

13:47.160 --> 13:48.660
you did an excellent job.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.078
Thank you.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.626
Hello?

13:59.422 --> 14:01.590
Showering's real fun,
isn't it?

14:07.096 --> 14:10.265
If we're going to have
any kind of fun together,

14:11.768 --> 14:14.019
you guys had
better loosen up.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.694
What are we
going to do with her?

14:23.404 --> 14:24.530
Look,

14:25.323 --> 14:27.032
we'll just go with
the situation, okay?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.700
And I'm sure by Sunday,
you'll think of something.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.662
You're a very bright guy.
I have a lot of
faith in you, okay?

14:31.746 --> 14:33.038
All right?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.581
I'm just being practical.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.084
Well, I know you are, okay?
And I appreciate it.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.418
Let's go.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.255
What are we going to
do about this mess?

14:41.339 --> 14:44.174
Wyatt,
you'll have plenty of time
to clean up tomorrow, okay?

14:44.259 --> 14:47.844
Okay, but don't get
any b.o. On Chet's suit,
or he'd kill me.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.516
Where are we going, anyway?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.059
I don't know.
She said we're going
to go downtown and...

14:54.143 --> 14:56.562
Oh, my God!
Whose stuff is this?

14:56.646 --> 14:57.813
Is that your suit?
Wait, is this yours?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.897
Oh, shit.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.107
Holy shit.
Gary,
I don't know what's going...

15:00.191 --> 15:01.400
Why? What's going on here?
I don't know.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.901
What is going on here?
Gary, I don't know!

15:02.986 --> 15:04.111
I don't know
what's going on here!

15:04.195 --> 15:05.529
Gary, you look good,
though, all right?

15:05.613 --> 15:06.905
Yeah?
Yeah.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.247
So, did you steal this car?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.416
No, I didn't steal the car.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.167
How'd you get it?

15:20.211 --> 15:22.504
I can get anything I want.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.631
And right now,
I want to party.

15:24.716 --> 15:25.799
Party?

15:25.883 --> 15:29.469
Yeah, and you better think up
a name for me, too.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.430
What name do you want?

15:31.514 --> 15:34.600
You guys created me,
you think of a name for me.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.226
How about Lisa?

15:36.311 --> 15:37.603
Why Lisa?

15:39.188 --> 15:40.439
Why not?

15:40.982 --> 15:43.275
He used to like
a girl named Lisa.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.319
Oh, yeah? Old girlfriend?

15:45.653 --> 15:47.738
She kicked him
in the nuts.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.616
Will you shut up?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.909
Look, Gary,
it wasn't your fault.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.077
All you said
was hello to her.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.246
Yeah, look, Wyatt, shut up!

29:48.412 --> 29:50.455
Not that I'm aware of, no.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.666
Hey, that looks pretty good.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.049
Now make yourself one,
dick weed.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.600
I like your panties.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.560
(BURPS)

30:13.228 --> 30:14.687
It's a joke, Chet.
You know, it's all...

30:14.771 --> 30:16.397
That's not a joke!

30:16.482 --> 30:18.858
That is a severe
behavioral disorder.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.194
Those are
women's underpants!

30:21.570 --> 30:25.531
I mean, the next thing
you know, you'll be wearing
a bra on your head.

30:25.616 --> 30:29.202
The old man's
going to have a stroke
on this one for sure.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.330
All right, Chet.
How much?

30:32.414 --> 30:33.664
How much?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.876
CHET: This goes way
beyond payment, pal.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.920
Come on, Chet. Please?

30:40.923 --> 30:42.173
Well...

30:45.093 --> 30:47.261
Your VCR should cover it.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.804

30:49.848 --> 30:51.224
Thank you.

30:51.725 --> 30:54.644

will you cover yourself?

You guys looking
for something for your mom?

31:20.587 --> 31:22.964
I really don't
think so, Sue.

31:25.092 --> 31:28.010
You guys have girlfriends?

31:28.512 --> 31:31.222
You know, Sue,
one does really not refer

31:31.306 --> 31:33.891

woman as a girlfriend.

Susan, do you think you
could wrap up a bottle
of this scent for me?

31:55.372 --> 31:57.164
Cause it's... I like this.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.749
Two.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.960
And why don't
you set yourself up
with one of them, too.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.921
Set yourself up.
That's three scents, please.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.008
If you were
a 15-year-old boy,

32:08.343 --> 32:10.344
would these turn you on?

32:12.180 --> 32:14.473
I think so, too.
I'll take them.

32:22.316 --> 32:24.650
Do you have
a bra to match that?

32:24.735 --> 32:27.945
Something in
leather or rubber,
or barb wire?

No.

of that, please?

really bored of their shit.

to dump them?

with them three months.

We've been to
all the parties.
We've met all the people.

33:46.608 --> 33:47.858
We won't go to
any more parties

33:47.943 --> 33:49.193
and we won't meet
any more people.

another chance?

there's a party tonight
at Wyatt's house.

to have a heart attack
by the time you're 40

if you don't learn
to relax.

difficult, demanding
and totally bizarre.

they're normal parents.

you want to party so badly,
you could bottle it.

you want friends,
you want popularity,

you want all
that stuff, right?

about it, sure, but...

If you want to be
a party animal,

you have to learn to
live in the jungle.

and go and get dressed.

and pick up Gary.

meet his parents.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.042
ALL: Hi!

43:07.126 --> 43:08.252
MAN: Party!

43:08.336 --> 43:10.087
ALL: Party! Party!
Party! Party!

43:10.171 --> 43:11.755
Party! Party! Party! Party!

43:11.839 --> 43:14.424
Party! Party! Party!

43:14.509 --> 43:15.717
Party! Party! Party!
Party! Party! Party!

43:16.177 --> 43:17.761
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

43:39.367 --> 43:40.617
(SHOUTS)

43:41.577 --> 43:44.204
How you doing?

43:44.747 --> 43:46.540
Where's the bar?
Bar!

43:49.877 --> 43:52.713
Do you think they'll
embarrass us tonight?

43:52.797 --> 43:55.799
Yeah.

44:01.389 --> 44:02.681
Caviar?

44:03.349 --> 44:06.351
If Max and lan see her,
it is all over for us.

44:08.313 --> 44:09.688
How's your stomach?

44:09.772 --> 44:11.606
It's a little better.

44:11.816 --> 44:15.068
If you're going to
float an air biscuit,
let me know, okay?

44:15.153 --> 44:16.695
Float a what?

44:16.779 --> 44:18.405
If you're going to fart,
if you're going
to squeeze cheese,

44:18.489 --> 44:20.490
let me know, okay?
I'll hit the fan.

44:20.575 --> 44:23.410
I'm sorry, Gary.
It's just I suffer
pain and discomfort

44:23.494 --> 44:26.079
due to occasional
stomach upset.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.374
You know,
I can't believe this, Wyatt.
I'm so disappointed in us.

44:29.459 --> 44:30.459
I mean, all we ever do
is sit around

44:30.543 --> 44:31.585
and talk about
how great it would be

44:31.669 --> 44:33.003
if we went to parties, right?
And...

44:33.087 --> 44:34.046
And now it's our party,

44:34.130 --> 44:35.797
and there are
hundreds of people
here having a great time,

44:35.882 --> 44:37.674
and we're in the john.
We're in the john.

44:37.759 --> 44:39.551
I can't believe it.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.345
Gary, you're just
as uptight as I am,
all right?

44:41.429 --> 44:44.222
Let me tell you something.
Nobody can be as
uptight as you, okay?

44:44.307 --> 44:46.308
Nobody. Your middle
name is tense, okay?

44:46.392 --> 44:48.018
Wyatt "Tense Up" Donnelly.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.686
All right, this is true.
This is true.

44:49.771 --> 44:50.854
It's true.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.105
But...

44:52.774 --> 44:55.942
It's not that bad.
I mean, we can
hear the music.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.111
This is great.
We can dance.
So that's great.

44:58.196 --> 45:00.739
If we put our
noses to the door,
maybe we can smell the food.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.074
Hey, brother!

45:02.158 --> 45:04.326
What's happening,
my main man?

45:04.660 --> 45:05.952
Right on!

45:06.621 --> 45:07.579
Scotch.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.164
Straight up?

45:09.248 --> 45:10.832
Give me the whole bottle.

45:10.917 --> 45:15.587
Tell you what. You bend over
and I'll shove it
straight up your ass.

45:16.798 --> 45:18.632
On the rocks is fine.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.012
Yeah, that's what I thought
you were gonna say.

45:37.610 --> 45:38.610
There she is.

45:38.694 --> 45:40.570
You deal with the drinks.
I'll kill the girls.

45:54.794 --> 45:56.920
I wonder if Lisa's
having a good time.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.590
Lisa could have a good time
at an insurance seminar,
Wyatt.

46:00.675 --> 46:03.677
You know, the thing that
really galls me

46:04.887 --> 46:08.140
is that she's ours
and we can't
get close to her.

46:10.852 --> 46:12.310
Hit the fan.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.941
This is, like, the best
party I've ever been to.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.734
I know. It's great!

46:20.403 --> 46:22.779
Do you know
whose house this is?

46:23.239 --> 46:24.656
I don't know.
I think it might be

46:24.740 --> 46:27.159
that girl with
the English accent.

46:27.535 --> 46:29.244
Did you notice that girl
doesn't have a zit

46:29.328 --> 46:31.079
on her whole body?
Did you notice that?

46:31.164 --> 46:33.039
I know.
She has, like, zero fat.

46:33.124 --> 46:34.583
And she's so relaxed.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.877
She burped and it was,
like, charming.
Charming.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.003
Yeah.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.714
Shit.

46:42.383 --> 46:44.217
Yeah.
The bathroom.

46:52.435 --> 46:53.477
Ladies.
Hi.

46:53.561 --> 46:54.728
Hi.
Hi.

46:56.481 --> 46:58.398
GARY: I can't believe you!
I cannot...

46:58.483 --> 47:01.109
You're dropping wolf bait
and there are chicks outside!

47:01.194 --> 47:04.654
Light a match or something.
Light a fire, I don't know.

47:07.366 --> 47:08.658
Hi.
Hi.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.118
Hi.

47:10.203 --> 47:12.370
We're sorry.
We thought there were
just girls in there.

47:12.455 --> 47:13.497
I'm sorry.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.790
It's just us dudes.
You know.

47:16.209 --> 47:18.210
What are you doing here?

47:18.294 --> 47:20.712
WYATT: Gary was
just taking a shit.

47:21.214 --> 47:22.923
No, what I meant was...

47:24.800 --> 47:27.886
No, no, what I meant was,
what are you
doing at the party?

47:27.970 --> 47:29.679
Oh, it's my house.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.515
This is your party?

47:31.599 --> 47:34.267
Yeah, well, you know,
we like to do this
about once a week.

47:34.393 --> 47:35.560
You know,
throw little gatherings here.
Really?

47:35.645 --> 47:36.770
Yeah, little get-togethers.
That kind of thing.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.688
Haven't you guys been by?
Or...

47:38.773 --> 47:39.773
No.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.358
How the heck did we
miss these two, Wyatt?

47:41.442 --> 47:43.860
I don't know.
So many people,
so many parties.

47:43.945 --> 47:45.946
So many people, you know,
and so many parties.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.240
You know,
you lose track and...

47:48.824 --> 47:51.952
Would you mind if I came in
and checked my face?

47:52.036 --> 47:54.120
What's wrong
with your face?

47:55.706 --> 47:57.290
Can we come in?

47:57.333 --> 47:59.834
Come on in.
WYATT: Sure, yeah.
Okay. Be our guests.

47:59.919 --> 48:01.294
Thanks, guys.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.712
Come on in.

48:05.091 --> 48:06.258
Well...

48:07.093 --> 48:09.135
We've seen you
guys at school,
but we've never met.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.387
You're Hilly.
You're Deb.

48:10.471 --> 48:11.596
How you doing?
Deb.

48:11.681 --> 48:13.473
You're Deb. Hi. I'm Gary.
I'm Wyatt.

48:13.558 --> 48:14.641
Hi, Gary.

48:14.725 --> 48:17.143
Well, what have
you guys been doing?

48:18.145 --> 48:21.856
This is a wild crowd.
I didn't know you guys
had so many friends.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.442
Yeah, neither did we.
Neither did we.

48:26.112 --> 48:27.571
Who's the girl
with the accent?

48:27.655 --> 48:29.322
I thought that this
was her party, but I...

48:29.407 --> 48:33.493
You mean the real sensuous,
exotic, sexy, mature,
sex symbol type?

48:33.578 --> 48:34.995
Yeah.
Yeah.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.163
GARY: She's with us.

48:37.707 --> 48:39.457
She's with you guys?

48:40.543 --> 48:42.460
Come on, Lisa. Why not?

48:44.505 --> 48:46.965
Because I belong
to Gary and Wyatt.

48:47.883 --> 48:51.636
Belong? What?
They make you in the garage
with power tools?

48:52.013 --> 48:55.223
They own you? Control you?
Seriously.

48:56.017 --> 48:57.267
Seriously.

48:57.351 --> 48:58.852
They're toads.

48:58.978 --> 49:01.730
Do I look like I'd
go out with two toads?

49:02.440 --> 49:04.941
You do. It's true.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.569
I think Gary and
Wyatt are gonna force

49:07.653 --> 49:09.988
everyone to
redefine their terms.

49:11.741 --> 49:14.242
And you're completely
loyal to them?

49:14.869 --> 49:17.746
I do whatever they say.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.425
Hi.

49:33.220 --> 49:36.556
Could you excuse us
for a minute, please?

49:37.141 --> 49:38.975
That's no problem.
Yeah, we'll be in here.

49:39.060 --> 49:41.394
Yeah, that's where we'll...
Yeah.

49:49.195 --> 49:50.570
Okay, fine.

49:54.450 --> 49:56.701
I could be wrong, but I think
these ladies are
stoked for us, Wyatt.

49:56.786 --> 49:58.119
I got that feeling myself.

49:58.204 --> 49:59.371
What do we do?
I don't know.

49:59.455 --> 50:00.955
Should we go for it?
What about Lisa?

50:01.040 --> 50:02.165
She did say we should party.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.792
Look, let's get it on
with these two,
score points

50:03.876 --> 50:05.418
and go back to Lisa.
This is like
a dream come true.

50:05.503 --> 50:07.337
How about if we see
if we can score
the points with these two

50:07.421 --> 50:08.505
and deal with them in
case we can't later.

50:08.589 --> 50:09.589
Sounds good.

50:09.674 --> 50:10.882
But whatever happens,
gotta give Lisa a shot.

50:10.966 --> 50:12.050
I don't want to
hurt her feelings.

50:12.134 --> 50:14.594
I think the girls are
looking for a long,
lean bone job from me.

50:14.679 --> 50:15.845
Ready to party down?
10-4.

50:15.930 --> 50:17.722
Let's break.
Break.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.361
Those guys are weird,
but they're kind of cute.

50:31.445 --> 50:33.196
Hi.
Hi.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.824
And where did you
two disappear to?

50:36.951 --> 50:40.120
Nowhere.
We were in the kitchen.
We were in the bathroom.

50:41.122 --> 50:42.789
Eating.
Doing our hair.

50:43.457 --> 50:45.500
Have you met Gary and Wyatt?

50:45.584 --> 50:47.001
Yeah.
No.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.212
Sort of.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.049
If you get the chance,

50:53.634 --> 50:54.718
shower with them.

50:54.802 --> 50:55.969
I did.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.054
It's a mind scrambler!

50:59.223 --> 51:00.890
Hurts so good.

51:06.439 --> 51:08.314
She took a shower
with them.

51:08.983 --> 51:11.276
I have
a wonderful idea, Henry.

51:11.736 --> 51:15.572
After dinner,
why don't we stop by
and visit with Wyatt.

51:15.990 --> 51:19.284
I hate to think
of his being alone
at home tonight.

51:19.952 --> 51:21.828
Doesn't he have
anything to read?

51:21.912 --> 51:23.747
Well, I don't know, dear,

51:23.831 --> 51:27.250
but you know nothing's
more important
to a teenage boy

51:27.334 --> 51:29.210
than his grandparents.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.588
We'll drop by.
Oh, good.

51:32.840 --> 51:34.174
(LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

51:45.561 --> 51:50.523
I'd like to open up
by apologizing for the
ICEE today at the mall.

51:50.608 --> 51:52.776
It was very immature.
And I'm sorry.

51:52.860 --> 51:56.446
And... It was just,
like, tomfoolery.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.698
But we are sorry.

51:58.783 --> 52:00.325
It happened.

52:00.409 --> 52:01.534
Yeah.

52:01.869 --> 52:03.870
So what's the deal
with Lisa?

52:03.954 --> 52:06.080
You know,
can we borrow her?

52:07.041 --> 52:08.166
We can't do that, guys.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.668
You know, because
common decency prohibits us.
We can't.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.170
It's not that cool.

52:12.254 --> 52:14.714
Well, she said it was cool.
Yeah.

52:14.799 --> 52:18.551
We can't take advantage
of her loyalties.
Sorry, guys.

52:18.636 --> 52:21.554
Man, but that's
really selfish.
That hurts, you know.

52:21.639 --> 52:22.889
Lan...

52:23.516 --> 52:25.767
Just forget it, guys,
'cause we can't
do it, you know?

52:25.851 --> 52:28.603
Come on.
Quit being such pricks.

52:28.687 --> 52:29.813
Hey, come on.

52:29.897 --> 52:32.148
Regardless of what
she may have told you,

52:32.233 --> 52:34.317
our feelings for
Lisa run very deep.

52:34.401 --> 52:36.903
It's, like, emotions.
Heavy, heavy emotions.

52:36.987 --> 52:39.906
Our feelings for Deb
and Hilly run as deep
as yours do for Lisa.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.407
And it's respect.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.785
It's like the time
we spend together,
you know.

52:43.869 --> 52:46.746
And a couple of guys
like you deserve them.

52:46.914 --> 52:50.124
See, we like your style.
So we want to
make a deal with you.

52:50.209 --> 52:51.793
You let us have
a crack at Lisa

52:51.877 --> 52:54.712
and then we'll let
you have Deb and Hilly.

52:56.882 --> 52:58.967
Can you guys keep a secret?

52:59.051 --> 53:00.927
Sure.
Secret?

53:01.554 --> 53:04.430
Look again. It's Gary.
No, no.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.558
It's our boy, Gary.

53:06.934 --> 53:09.602
He's our 16-year-old boy.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.480
I don't know
what the hell you're
talking about, Lucy.

53:12.565 --> 53:14.607
And I want you to shut up.

53:15.568 --> 53:19.153
WYATT: I feel like an asshole.
This had better work.

53:19.238 --> 53:20.947
This is just the blueprint.
Okay, now look.

Bigger tits.

He and Grandpa
are working on a new project.

You had to be big shots,
didn't you?

56:27.468 --> 56:29.218

can give them.

we're not going
to approve, Henry.

for real, all right.

57:48.549 --> 57:50.716

would you?

than to walk into
somebody's house

with your Rex Harrison hat.

close personal friend
of your grandson's.

58:23.584 --> 58:25.501
Henry, call the police.

58:25.586 --> 58:28.754
I will.
I'll have you incarcerated.

on their computer.

and listen to this baloney.

He won't, you know.
He doesn't stand for baloney.

I won't be a moment.

Never.

Wyatt, your grandparents
are downstairs.

You want to try one?

they're better than fine.

Lisa, if any more of
his relatives drop by,

59:43.330 --> 59:46.082
we'll be upstairs in
the bathroom, okay?

59:46.166 --> 59:48.167
That's pretty sick, Lis.

59:48.627 --> 59:52.004
Those guys really need
some self-confidence.

59:53.131 --> 59:54.757
A challenge.

their inner strength
and courage.

But...

I mean, it's definitely
a different kind of love.

sisterly, you know.

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:13.198
Chet!

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.575
Where's my brother?

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.285
(WINCES)

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:21.790
I don't know.

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.626
You're dead meat, pilgrim.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.591
Chet, Chet, Chet, Chet, Chet,
that's her nose. Come on.

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:33.802
Now, look, she has
nothing to do with it.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:36.388
Okay. You die.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.975
She walks out of here
with a severe limp.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.317
I'll be back.

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:57.117
That's Wyatt's
older brother, Chet.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:58.702
He's kind of an asshole.

01:15:01.873 --> 01:15:03.331
Oh, hi, Chet.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:07.043
What the hell is
going on around here?

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:09.087
Chet, I'm sorry,
it was an accident.

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:11.423
An accident? An accident?

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:15.886
Do you realize
it's snowing in my room,
God damn it?

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.680
Some real weird
shit happened, Chet.
Some real weird shit.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:22.559
You don't have to be a genius
to figure that out,
monkey dick.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.688
Start talking, little man.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.481
Look, Chet, it's
a real long story.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.358
Gary and I were messing
around with the computer
Friday night,

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:31.776
and we decided
to make a woman.
And when we did,

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.195
she went crazy
and she messed up
the whole house.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:36.364
Don't smart-mouth me,
you wormy little shit!

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.908
Why don't you
just leave him alone?

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:40.368
Stay out of this, bimbo.
This is a family matter.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:44.247
Chet, just let me find Lisa.
She can explain everything.

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:47.626
She'll clear
everything up, Chet.
I swear. Chet.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:52.130
You can have my college money
and my social security, Chet.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:16:02.224
So, you guys think you can
pull one over on me, huh?

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:03.683
Huh?

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:07.562
You got everybody synched
to the same bullshit story.

01:16:07.647 --> 01:16:10.982
This isn't bullshit.
This is a Pershing
missile, Chip.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:12.651
It's Chet.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:14.819
My name is Chet.

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:19.950
And I didn't think
it was a whale's dick, honey.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.705
Hi, Nanny. Hi, Grampy.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.085
I'm not a moron,
you know. I...

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:36.174
Was that my grandparents?

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:42.639
Are they dead?

01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:44.891
Oh, no.
They're just resting.

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:47.435
What are they doing in here?

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.521
LISA: I put them in there.

01:16:49.981 --> 01:16:52.816
I didn't want the boys
to get into trouble.

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:56.736
And quite frankly,
they weren't having
a very good time at the party.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.446
CHET: Not having a good time?

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:02.701
Do you think
they're having a good time
being catatonic in a closet?

01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:07.664
Do you have any idea
how disrespectful that is?

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:13.712
Boy, I wouldn't
give a squirt of piss
for your ass right now.

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:22.220
Okay, that's quite enough.
You guys get the girls home.

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:26.474
Wyatt, take the Porsche.
Gary, you take the Ferrari.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:27.976
The Ferrari?

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.062
I want to be alone
with Chet here.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:33.148
Good to see you again, Chet.
Get out of here!

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.275
Come on, take your
little hussies home!

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:38.028
Their parents are
probably worried sick.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:45.869
Lady, I want to get to
the bottom of this, asafp.

01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:47.412
Oh, so do I.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.209
But first, I'd like
to butter your muffin.

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:55.879
Why do you have to
be such a wanker?

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:58.381
Because I get off on it.

01:17:58.466 --> 01:18:02.510
Now I want you to promise
that you'll keep
your big mouth shut

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:05.305
about everything
that has happened here
this weekend.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:09.100
And I want you to
treat Wyatt and Gary
with dignity and respect.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.602
Oh, really?

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.604
Yeah. Oh, really.

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:16.900
I can be
a real serious bitch

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.278
if I don't get
what I want.

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.865
Hit me with your best shot.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.748
How fast are you going?

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:33.750
About 35.

Are you looking at
the rpms?

No. I think I'm looking
at about 50 tickets.

Who is this Gary character?

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.304
I had a really
great time last night.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:14.392
I'll probably be grounded
for a month or so, but...

01:20:15.895 --> 01:20:17.562
I'll wait for you.

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:54.682
Hilly!

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:56.684
I love you!

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:05.610
All right!

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.201
I want to thank you
for a great night.

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:14.702
Same here.

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:19.832
Deb, I have kind of
a confession to make.

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.630
I'm really not this cool.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.967
That's not my car.

01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:31.135
This is not my suit.

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:35.014
I mean, none of those
people were my friends.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:37.976
Why are you telling me
all of this?

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:42.855
Because I want you to
like me for what I am.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.316
Whatever you are, I like it.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.132
I'd better get going.

'Cause Wyatt and I still
have to deal with Chet.

you stupid bitch!

Oh, now careful, Chet.
Don't make me angry.

Sorry.

Would you please
turn me back to normal,
please?

anything to you.

No, but you've done
plenty to your brother.

Like what?

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:41.623
Well, let me see.
You've nagged him,
harassed him,

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:44.626
suppressed him,
kept him in fear of you.

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.544
Extorted money from him.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:48.963

ought to give you
a set of elephant balls.

and get changed.

to wear off, okay?

we're gonna have to
have a talk with her.

wouldn't want to date you.
