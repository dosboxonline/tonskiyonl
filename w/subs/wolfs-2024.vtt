00:40.749 --> 00:42.918
Fuck. Fuck.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.505
Fuck. Oh, God.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.424
Okay. Holy shit. No.

01:08.986 --> 01:09.987
For Christ's sake.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.085
Hey.

01:40.642 --> 01:41.643
Holy shit.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.961
Oh, G--

02:35.781 --> 02:36.782
No.

02:59.805 --> 03:00.931
<i>We're sorry,</i>

03:00.931 --> 03:04.601
<i>you have reached a number that has been
disconnected or is no longer in service.</i>

03:04.601 --> 03:07.104
<i>Please check the number
and try your call again.</i>

03:21.702 --> 03:22.703
Hello.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.541
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

03:32.171 --> 03:37.676
I was told that if I ever needed help,
serious help, to call you.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.179
<i>Let me ask you again.
How did you get this number?</i>

03:41.346 --> 03:42.681
He said you'd ask that,

03:43.682 --> 03:46.602
the man who gave it to me,
and he said not to say.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.812
<i>That doesn't make very much sense,
does it?</i>

03:48.812 --> 03:50.981
<i>How do I know that I can trust you</i>

03:50.981 --> 03:53.317
<i>if you won't tell me
who gave you this number?</i>

03:56.528 --> 04:01.867
He said to say there's only one man
in the city who can do what you do.

04:03.160 --> 04:09.041
He said, "That man is an expert.
That man is a professional."

04:10.751 --> 04:13.545
And he said
you can never predict the future

04:13.545 --> 04:17.507
and that maybe one day,
I may need that one man.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.594
And that one man is you.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.389
Where are you?

04:26.892 --> 04:27.893
And what happened?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.815
Okay. And you're sure?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.193
All right.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.198
Now, what I need you to do is gonna
be difficult, but you can do it, okay?

04:42.074 --> 04:44.743
I need you to activate the
do-not-disturb light for your room

04:44.743 --> 04:48.121
and then do absolutely nothing
till I get there. You understand?

04:48.956 --> 04:52.835
Good. You're not to leave the room.
You're not to make any phone calls.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.587
You're not to touch anything.
You're not to answer the door.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.382
You're not to pour yourself a drink
to steady your nerves.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.634
You understand? Repeat that back to me.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.807
Okay. That's great. You're doing great.
Yes, I'll be there as quickly as possible.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.603
How will you know it's me?
This is how you'll know it's me.

05:15.858 --> 05:19.570
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'll be there before you know it.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.905
Co-Come in.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.199
- Did you talk to anyone?
- No.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.075
- Call anyone?
- No. No one.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.745
Text? Any kind of communication at all?

08:14.745 --> 08:17.164
No. Nothing.
I sat there just like you said.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.417
Okay. Good.
You can pour yourself that drink now.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.419
Yeah. A-Any kind?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.379
Strong is probably best.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.423
Okay. Do you want something?

08:27.341 --> 08:28.342
Thanks, no.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.847
- Does anybody know you're here?
- I don't think so, no.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.975
- You don't think so?
- No. No one knows I'm here.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.977
What about the room?

08:38.977 --> 08:41.104
Did anyone recognize you
when you checked in?

08:41.104 --> 08:43.315
No. I used an alias. I always do.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.735
I mean, anytime I get a hotel room.
Not when I'm--

08:48.028 --> 08:49.196
I understand. That's good.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.157
I got the room right after I met--

08:52.157 --> 08:54.368
I made him wait by the elevator
so no one would--

08:55.827 --> 08:57.287
I don't do this.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.540
This isn't something I do.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.708
All right, listen.
I want you to look at the time.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.962
Is there anyone that would be concerned
that they haven't heard from you yet?

09:04.962 --> 09:06.421
- Oh, God. I don't kn--
- Think.

09:06.964 --> 09:10.175
N-No. I generally go and do as I please.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.301
Good. I understand.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.266
- And you can make all of this go away?
- That's why you called me.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.686
He was jumping on the bed.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.272
And he fell and crashed into the glass.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.691
This would be the end.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.110
- Everything I've worked so hard to build.
- Okay.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.405
And we're on the verge
of doing something truly important.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.074
All right. We don't have time for that.
We don't have much time at all.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.368
It wasn't my fault. I didn't do anything--

09:36.368 --> 09:39.162
None of it matters.
It doesn't matter, okay?

09:39.788 --> 09:41.582
No, no. You listen to me.

09:41.582 --> 09:45.752
You need to know this.
I didn't do anything. We were--

09:45.752 --> 09:47.588
If you weren't here right now,
where would you be?

09:48.547 --> 09:49.548
What? What do you mean?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.091
If this was a normal night,

09:51.717 --> 09:54.178
and you weren't
in a $10,000 penthouse suite

09:54.178 --> 09:57.431
with a dead prostitute face down
in a pool of blood and broken glass,

09:57.431 --> 09:58.599
where would you be?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.017
He was not a prostitute.

10:03.729 --> 10:07.691
Home. I would be home working,
watching TV with my daughter--

10:07.691 --> 10:10.027
Okay. Good.
That's where I want you to be now.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.029
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.449
You're home. You're sitting on the couch.
What's your daughter's name?

10:15.449 --> 10:16.909
I have two daughters.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.911
Julia. That's who I would--

10:18.911 --> 10:21.747
All right. You're watching TV with Julia.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.540
Okay.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.251
I will make sure that none of this
gets traced back to you in any way.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.921
Like it never happened. Whatever it takes.
No matter what.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.089
Thank you.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.174
That's the job.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.555
When I was given your number,
I thought it was a joke.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.725
I didn't know
people like you really existed.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.603
They don't.
There's nobody who can do what I do.

11:04.748 --> 11:05.749
What was that?

11:12.798 --> 11:14.174
- Say, "Hello."
- What?

11:14.716 --> 11:16.468
- Say, "Hello."
- Hello.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.637
Louder.

11:18.637 --> 11:19.721
Hello?

11:19.721 --> 11:22.140
No service, please. Thank you.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.760
Can I help you?

12:00.554 --> 12:01.680
I don't think so, no.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.562
Who are you?

12:10.189 --> 12:12.983
I'm here to take care of your problem.
Who is he?

12:13.775 --> 12:14.902
I called him.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.404
Who called you?

12:33.837 --> 12:36.423
Son of a bitch.

12:43.847 --> 12:44.973
What's going on?

12:48.810 --> 12:49.811
Yeah.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.398
Got it.

12:55.192 --> 12:58.779
He does. I know. It's weird. Okay.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.619
What?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.207
Hello? Who is this?

13:17.089 --> 13:18.090
Okay.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.263
Okay. Yes.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.403
I completely understand.
And I have no doubt

13:39.403 --> 13:42.531
that we can come to some
sort of agreement that satisfies us both.

13:44.533 --> 13:48.078
Well, I hardly think you're
in a position to be negotiating anything.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.789
Uh-huh.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.960
Fair point. That is a fair point.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.922
- So, tell me, what would you suggest?
- <i>...illegal camera up there?</i>

13:59.423 --> 14:01.550
Got a hidden fucking camera.
That's illegal surveillance.

14:01.550 --> 14:04.761
That's a class D felony in
the state of New York. A class D felony.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.848
You're more than welcome to leave, sir.
Your services are no longer required.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.266
Come on.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.934
What's the play here?

14:10.934 --> 14:13.187
I don't know
what you're talking about, sir.

14:18.317 --> 14:19.484
What?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.864
You did check to see if--

14:25.199 --> 14:27.701
Okay, you're on speaker.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.203
<i>Hello? Are the men there?</i>

14:29.203 --> 14:30.287
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

14:30.287 --> 14:31.997
- Yes, they're here.
- <i>Wonderful.</i>

14:31.997 --> 14:35.792
<i>Now then, we clearly have a situation
here, and time's of the essence.</i>

14:35.792 --> 14:37.503
<i>So, I'm not going to mince words.</i>

14:37.503 --> 14:39.463
<i>My name is Pamela Dowd-Herdry.</i>

14:39.463 --> 14:41.882
<i>This is my hotel. It's very new.</i>

14:41.882 --> 14:44.009
<i>It's very expensive, and I have a clear,</i>

14:44.009 --> 14:47.304
<i>vested interest in minimizing any sort
of controversy associated with it.</i>

14:47.304 --> 14:50.390
<i>I am very aware of the stigma
that can become attached to a building,</i>

14:50.390 --> 14:54.645
<i>and I'm not interested in being the owner
of a hotel where a district attorney,</i>

14:54.645 --> 14:57.898
<i>whom I greatly admire
and whose work I believe in very much,</i>

14:57.898 --> 15:00.275
- <i>was found with a dead prostitute.</i>
- He wasn't--

15:00.275 --> 15:02.402
<i>So that being said,
I have brought in someone I know</i>

15:02.402 --> 15:04.571
<i>through a trusted friend
to take care of this problem.</i>

15:04.571 --> 15:07.157
<i>He is an expert.
He is the very best there is.</i>

15:07.157 --> 15:11.453
<i>There is, quite simply, no one else
out there who can do what he does.</i>

15:12.579 --> 15:13.705
Thank you, Pam.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.792
<i>Now, of course, my guest
has her own interests at stake as well</i>

15:16.792 --> 15:19.545
<i>and feels the need to make sure those
interests are protected,</i>

15:19.545 --> 15:23.590
<i>which is why she has insisted on
maintaining her own person</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:25.884
<i>to ensure this little problem goes away.</i>

15:25.884 --> 15:27.427
<i>And as we have reached an impasse</i>

15:27.427 --> 15:30.931
<i>as to whose man would be better suited
to accomplish the task,</i>

15:30.931 --> 15:34.685
<i>we have decided that the only course
of action is for you both to work together</i>

15:34.685 --> 15:38.188
<i>to clean up this
absolute fucking clusterfuck of a mess.</i>

15:44.236 --> 15:45.529
<i>Hello?</i>

15:47.155 --> 15:47.990
No.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.702
Pam, I'd like to have a word.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.038
- Please, wait. Please.
- No. No.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.081
Wait a minute.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.457
You're joking, right? This a joke.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.793
- You can't just leave.
- This is not how I work.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.421
- How do I know I can trust him? I don't--
- Know this guy.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.259
Well, sure, maybe.
Or maybe he's just some knucklehead.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.261
You don't know me.
How do you know you can trust me?

16:09.261 --> 16:11.972
I don't, but I trust the man
who gave me your number because--

16:11.972 --> 16:13.098
Careful.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.809
Because when he says something, it has
value, and he said I could trust you.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.604
Well, Pam, I don't see how
that has anything to do with me, does it?

16:18.604 --> 16:21.648
Are you appealing to my sense of honor?
Because that's not how this works.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.317
This is not how I work.

16:23.317 --> 16:26.361
He said if you take the job,
you give your word.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.197
And that word's the measure of a man.

16:29.865 --> 16:30.866
Not like this.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.161
You're on those tapes too.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.330
Forget about me.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.958
If you-- If you don't finish the job,
she's got you on camera.

16:45.714 --> 16:46.715
Pa--

16:49.176 --> 16:50.594
I know you can see me.

16:51.595 --> 16:52.596
Fine.

17:01.813 --> 17:02.940
The feeling's mutual.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.403
Okay. So, now what?

17:08.403 --> 17:10.781
- Well, I need to know--
- Well, the first thing I need t--

17:17.746 --> 17:19.790
I need to know everything you did tonight.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.375
Starting from when?

17:21.375 --> 17:24.419
Starting from when things went
from a normal night to this. Sit down.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.841
All right.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.177
I was at an event a few blocks away.

17:32.177 --> 17:35.514
After it was over, I wanted a drink.
I like the bar here.

17:35.514 --> 17:36.849
I had just walked in

17:36.849 --> 17:41.979
and was headed for the ladies' room
when this kid started talking to me.

17:41.979 --> 17:45.482
He was funny, and he was charming,
and he was so out of place.

17:45.482 --> 17:49.945
And I just said, you know,
"Do you wanna get a room?"

17:49.945 --> 17:53.866
It was a-- sort of a joke, sort of not.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.076
He said, "Sure."

17:56.076 --> 17:57.786
- And you never met him before?
- No.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.580
- No one saw you together?
- No.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.956
And then you came upstairs.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.958
I don't understand
why you need to know all this.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.877
Because I need to know
what I need to make disappear.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.420
- We.
- What?

18:06.420 --> 18:07.796
We need to know.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.885
- So, you came upstairs.
- We were drinking and fooling around--

18:12.885 --> 18:14.887
Excuse me.
When exactly did you get the room?

18:14.887 --> 18:17.639
- Before I came upstairs.
- Before she came upstairs.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.309
Before you met the kid
or after you met the kid?

18:20.309 --> 18:22.436
After I met the kid.
Before I came upstairs.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.938
Okay, thank you. I didn't know. Proceed.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.858
So, you were drinking and fooling around.

18:27.858 --> 18:31.236
- Was there ever a discussion of money?
- He's not a prostitute.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.864
No. Hey! I already-- God.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.993
This is already fucking embarrassing
and humiliating enough as it is.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.495
I don't understand
why I have to answer everything twice.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.372
You don't have to answer everything twice.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.082
You might have to
answer a few things twice.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.209
Jesus Christ, will you--

18:45.209 --> 18:47.920
Jesus Christ, do I know
what the two of you have spoken about?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.922
No, I do not.
I am trying to get up to speed.

18:49.922 --> 18:53.675
So you brought this 20-something
non-prostitute up to your room.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.677
You began drinking, fooling around, and...

18:55.677 --> 18:57.304
He goes into the bathroom,
and he comes out,

18:57.304 --> 18:58.889
he starts jumping up on the fucking bed,

18:58.889 --> 19:01.975
and he falls backwards onto the
fucking bar cart, and fucking drops dead.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.985
Is there anyone who might be concerned
they haven't heard from you tonight?

19:15.239 --> 19:16.240
Gonna get cleaned up.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.034
Gonna take your things,
and you're gonna leave.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.577
I'm covered in blood.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.955
You're gonna go home,
and you're gonna see your family,

19:22.955 --> 19:24.623
act like nothing ever happened.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.417
What?

19:30.045 --> 19:31.839
Did you by chance--

20:01.410 --> 20:04.454
So, you'll be in touch to coordinate the--

20:04.454 --> 20:07.249
Don't worry about it.
That time will come, but not now.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.918
And what exactly will happen to him?

20:10.961 --> 20:11.962
To who?

20:12.754 --> 20:13.797
Right.

20:16.592 --> 20:17.593
Okay.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.276
Hey, sweetie, did you eat?

20:34.276 --> 20:36.528
I'm on my way home.
I can pick up some food.

21:32.042 --> 21:32.960
What are you doing?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.215
You know, I was giving you
the benefit of the doubt,

21:38.215 --> 21:40.133
letting you clean up unsupervised.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.553
Unsupervised? Wow, that's an honor.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.722
I think you have
a fundamental misunderstanding

21:45.722 --> 21:47.224
of what is happening here.

21:47.224 --> 21:48.642
- Do I?
- Yes.

21:48.642 --> 21:50.811
I wanna finish the job and go home.

21:51.395 --> 21:54.189
And that is where
there is a fundamental misunderstanding.

21:55.232 --> 21:56.233
Enlighten me.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.235
Well, your job is to make sure that

21:58.235 --> 22:01.530
that mess behind you
cannot be traced back to your client,

22:01.530 --> 22:05.784
and to do that, you have to make sure that
that mess disappears completely.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.703
As if it never happened. Difficult.

22:07.703 --> 22:09.830
- For you, maybe.
- Well, that's irrelevant.

22:09.830 --> 22:12.666
Because my job is
to make sure that you do your job

22:12.666 --> 22:16.086
so that that mess
cannot be traced back to this hotel.

22:16.837 --> 22:17.838
Less difficult.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.717
So, you're just gonna sit there
and slurp your soda?

22:21.717 --> 22:22.843
I'm going to...

22:24.678 --> 22:26.013
supervise.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.309
Fuck you.

22:36.565 --> 22:37.816
Just don't touch anything.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.707
You're gonna get blood on your sweater.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.251
I won't get blood on my sweater.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.298
Thanks.

23:50.180 --> 23:53.016
Dump the body. Finish the job. Supervise.

24:44.401 --> 24:46.111
Oh, shit.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.121
I told you not to touch anything.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.347
Oh, shit.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.785
It's gonna be a long fucking night.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.958
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
I don't understand.</i>

25:40.958 --> 25:44.586
<i>Why can't you simply
dispose of the drugs as well?</i>

25:44.586 --> 25:46.839
- Cops find a dead kid in the park...
- There's zero reason why a kid...

25:46.839 --> 25:48.382
- ...overdosed...
- ...like that would be walking around...

25:48.382 --> 25:49.842
- ...they're asking questions.
- ...with this much product...

25:49.842 --> 25:51.051
which means it's probably stolen.

25:51.051 --> 25:54.555
So, whoever it does belong to
will be looking for it. In my experience,

25:54.555 --> 25:57.474
it's not the kind of people you want
knocking on the door of your hotel!

25:59.184 --> 26:01.562
<i>I have no clue what
either one of you just said.</i>

26:01.562 --> 26:05.607
<i>It strikes me that whoever those belong to
is going to wonder what happened to them.</i>

26:05.607 --> 26:08.068
<i>I don't want whoever that is
showing up here,</i>

26:08.068 --> 26:09.945
<i>and I certainly don't want to
take responsibility</i>

26:09.945 --> 26:13.282
<i>for throwing their product into the river
or turning it over to the police.</i>

26:13.282 --> 26:14.992
<i>So this is what you'll do.</i>

26:14.992 --> 26:17.327
<i>You'll find out who those drugs belong to,</i>

26:17.327 --> 26:19.162
<i>and you'll return them.</i>

26:19.162 --> 26:20.831
- No.
- Look, Pam, it's not--

26:22.165 --> 26:23.417
It's not that simple.

26:36.972 --> 26:39.266
- Could've been a tracker in there.
- Tracker.

26:39.266 --> 26:41.435
You don't think they'd already
be here if there was a--

26:45.063 --> 26:47.524
How the hell are we gonna
figure out who this belongs to?

26:48.150 --> 26:49.610
Body first, then the drugs.

26:50.277 --> 26:52.196
- Listen, if I were you, I'd--
- You're not.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.574
Hey, I don't want this to take all night.

26:55.574 --> 26:56.658
It won't.

26:57.284 --> 26:58.660
Okay then, so--

26:58.660 --> 27:01.788
Now you wanna get involved? Fuck you.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.040
Hey, you wanna help?

27:03.040 --> 27:06.001
Why don't you call your boss
and have her clear out the parking garage?

27:06.001 --> 27:07.836
We can take the body down in the tarp.

27:09.087 --> 27:10.088
You're joking.

27:10.088 --> 27:12.925
You have to clean the surveillance anyway.
No one's gonna see it.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.094
I get it.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.223
- What?
- Nothing.

27:19.223 --> 27:21.934
Just lucky for you, I'm here,
otherwise you're caught.

27:21.934 --> 27:23.519
- I get it.
- I'm trying to save time.

27:23.519 --> 27:25.270
No, it's okay. You don't have to explain.

27:25.270 --> 27:27.147
You can't do it. I'm gonna help you out.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.482
- I can do it.
- Really?

27:28.482 --> 27:30.317
- Yeah, really.
- So do it.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.402
Maybe I don't want you to see how I do it.

27:33.070 --> 27:34.071
Whatever you say.

27:34.905 --> 27:38.075
Hey, you know what?
Don't call your boss. Don't call.

27:38.075 --> 27:41.870
Fuck it. Like I need your fucking help.

27:41.870 --> 27:43.372
Okay, I'll fucking do it.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.056
Well, that's one way to do it.

28:47.311 --> 28:49.563
Looks like a dead body on a luggage cart.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.690
I'm not finished yet.

29:00.032 --> 29:01.325
Here's a lesson.

29:01.325 --> 29:04.244
You don't have to help.
I don't need you to help...

29:05.120 --> 29:07.623
but if you do, it'll go faster.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.210
I am enjoying the show.

29:39.530 --> 29:40.531
Thanks.

29:40.531 --> 29:41.698
Happy to help.

29:41.698 --> 29:43.283
- Dick.
- Putz.

29:52.251 --> 29:53.252
Wait.

29:55.087 --> 29:56.171
What?

29:56.171 --> 29:58.882
The parking garage is on
a different security system.

29:59.466 --> 30:00.843
You're an asshole.

30:01.635 --> 30:03.512
I just wanted to see
how an old man would do it,

30:03.512 --> 30:05.180
but your secret's safe with me.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.142
It's the red one.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.109
What?

30:30.289 --> 30:32.040
That should buy you an extra five.

30:38.797 --> 30:41.592
I don't need an extra fucking five.

30:54.188 --> 30:55.314
I have a fob.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.559
I have a fob.

32:41.628 --> 32:42.796
Just don't interfere.

32:42.796 --> 32:44.423
The old cone in the gate?

32:44.423 --> 32:46.592
Another trade secret?

32:46.592 --> 32:48.010
Let's wipe the tapes and go.

32:48.010 --> 32:49.678
- No.
- No?

32:49.678 --> 32:50.888
Although I am curious to see

32:50.888 --> 32:53.724
how you would've navigated
this next situation without me,

32:53.724 --> 32:55.434
I'm afraid I have to do this one alone.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.644
- Excuse me?
- I will wipe the tapes.

32:57.644 --> 33:00.189
- I just can't let you watch.
- Yeah. This is a two-way street.

33:00.189 --> 33:03.066
I was told specifically
to make sure you do not see this.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.985
By who? Your boss?

33:04.985 --> 33:06.570
She doesn't want you back there.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.614
You got hidden cameras
in a brand-new, luxury hotel.

33:08.614 --> 33:10.157
What kind of a scam are you running here?

33:10.157 --> 33:11.992
- You're not going back there.
- Really? Why?

33:11.992 --> 33:14.411
What are you hiding? Who are you exactly?

33:14.411 --> 33:16.830
Who am I? Fuck you, who am I. Who are you?

33:16.830 --> 33:18.749
- Some old bagman? Some old cleaner?
- Yeah.

33:18.749 --> 33:20.209
I'm not letting you in there.

33:20.209 --> 33:22.878
That's some big talk
coming from a hotel policeman.

33:22.878 --> 33:24.671
Big talk coming from the A/V club.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.757
I'm on those tapes
and I'm not leaving until I'm not.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.383
No one gives a shit
if you're on those tapes.

33:28.383 --> 33:29.635
How do you and I know
it's not some kind of a setup?

33:29.635 --> 33:31.595
- Oh, please.
- How?

33:31.595 --> 33:32.679
Setup, how?

33:32.679 --> 33:35.015
Maybe your boss
brought that kid here on purpose.

33:35.766 --> 33:36.642
- Go on.
- Yeah.

33:36.642 --> 33:38.894
Maybe she brought him
'cause she knows he's got drugs.

33:38.894 --> 33:41.230
Or she gave him the drugs,
and she's setting both of them up.

33:41.230 --> 33:42.481
They're having a good time,

33:42.481 --> 33:44.483
they're drinking,
they're laughing, all of that.

33:44.483 --> 33:47.736
But she wants him to overdose,
and she's got it on tape.

33:47.736 --> 33:48.862
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:48.862 --> 33:50.280
Then she makes a deal with my boss

33:50.280 --> 33:52.658
to clean the whole thing up
like it never happened.

33:52.658 --> 33:54.576
But she keeps the tape.

33:56.161 --> 33:57.162
For what?

33:58.455 --> 34:01.083
- For leverage, you dumbass.
- Leverage for what, dipshit?

34:01.083 --> 34:03.168
- You tell me, asshole.
- That makes no fucking sense.

34:03.168 --> 34:04.628
- You've seen too many movies.
- Fucking putz.

34:04.628 --> 34:06.046
I--

34:09.466 --> 34:10.467
- Shit.
- Fuck.

34:14.388 --> 34:15.639
- Shit.
- Fuck.

34:22.521 --> 34:23.981
You okay?

34:23.981 --> 34:25.607
- All good.
- Yep.

34:35.242 --> 34:36.869
That doesn't make sense,
he wasn't breathing.

34:44.918 --> 34:46.170
You didn't check his pulse?

34:46.170 --> 34:48.422
Fuck you, I didn't check his pulse.
He didn't have a fucking pulse.

34:48.422 --> 34:49.380
And yet...

34:49.380 --> 34:51.466
And yet you didn't check his pulse,
you didn't ask.

34:51.466 --> 34:54.469
- It's the first thing you do.
- He didn't have a fucking pulse.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.388
- And yet...
- And yet, you didn't ask.

34:56.388 --> 34:59.016
- You didn't say, "Is he dead?"
- I didn't think I had to.

34:59.016 --> 35:00.475
You think I didn't check his pulse?

35:00.475 --> 35:03.020
No, I do not. I think you got rattled.
I think you forgot.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.605
Bush-league is what you are.

35:04.605 --> 35:05.647
You walk into a situation,

35:05.647 --> 35:07.232
you see two people standing there,
one on the floor.

35:07.232 --> 35:08.901
You don't ask, "Does he have a pulse?"

35:08.901 --> 35:12.154
You don't ask, "Is he dead?"
You check for yourself.

35:12.154 --> 35:13.906
- Thank you, sensei.
- Yeah.

35:15.282 --> 35:16.909
I mean, maybe it was the drugs.
I don't know.

35:16.909 --> 35:20.204
That's just lazy bullshit.
It doesn't work that way.

35:20.204 --> 35:21.413
Well, he's not dead.

35:21.413 --> 35:22.831
It would appear not.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.753
- Just admit you didn't check.
- Just shut up. I'm trying to think.

35:27.753 --> 35:29.171
It was a magic drug

35:29.171 --> 35:32.591
- that makes your heartbeat so slow--
- Would you shut the fuck up?

35:32.591 --> 35:33.884
It doesn't matter.

35:35.886 --> 35:37.429
This is a different thing now.

35:43.810 --> 35:45.187
Wait, this is great.

35:49.191 --> 35:51.527
Think about it. He's gotta know.

35:53.779 --> 35:55.405
We need to go. We need to hurry.

35:55.989 --> 35:56.823
It's not a guarantee.

35:56.823 --> 36:01.286
I know, but we need to go now
before his brain turns into applesauce.

36:01.286 --> 36:02.746
Brain probably already is applesauce.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.540
Listen, I don't wanna
have to go door-to-door

36:04.540 --> 36:05.958
like some fucking Jehovah's Witness

36:05.958 --> 36:09.169
trying to return four fucking bricks of
God-knows-what-did-that-to-him, do you?

36:09.169 --> 36:12.297
- Was that your plan?
- I'm trying to make a point.

36:12.297 --> 36:13.632
It is worth a shot.

36:14.508 --> 36:15.509
I agree.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.636
Okay, then. I know someone.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.763
Fuck no.

36:20.430 --> 36:23.642
- What? My guy's good.
- Fuck your guy. Some bullet puller.

36:23.642 --> 36:26.019
- The only way that'd go is sideways.
- Fuck you. We're using my guy.

36:26.019 --> 36:28.397
It only works with my guy. It's exclusive.

36:28.397 --> 36:30.274
My car, my guy. Fuck you.

36:33.026 --> 36:34.236
Fucking--

36:39.658 --> 36:40.659
And?

36:43.704 --> 36:46.206
Didn't pick up. Where we going?

36:46.206 --> 36:47.291
Chinatown.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.168
Take a right out of the exit
and that'll take you--

36:49.168 --> 36:50.669
I know how to get to Chinatown.

37:38.967 --> 37:41.011
- The Albanians.
- What?

37:41.011 --> 37:43.514
The Albanians had this thing a while back.

37:43.514 --> 37:44.598
Yeah, I know.

37:44.598 --> 37:46.934
Massive shipment of pure, uncut heroin

37:46.934 --> 37:49.394
en route from Europe
suddenly just disappears.

37:49.394 --> 37:50.354
I know.

37:50.354 --> 37:52.231
You think those bricks
came from their shipment?

37:52.231 --> 37:53.815
- You should just take them back yourself.
- No.

37:53.815 --> 37:56.568
I'm not interested in being murdered,
is what I'm saying.

37:56.568 --> 37:57.986
The Albanians will kill

37:57.986 --> 38:01.281
and have killed anybody they even suspect
of stealing that shipment.

38:01.281 --> 38:04.535
So, whoever did it, sends this kid in
to be a honeypot

38:04.535 --> 38:07.496
to seduce my client
to get some political flex,

38:07.496 --> 38:12.209
to crack down on the Albanians to
clear the playing field to sell the drugs.

38:12.209 --> 38:15.337
So, they send in
the kid with the backpack.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.548
They want him to take the drugs,
they want him to overdose,

38:17.548 --> 38:18.882
and--

38:23.846 --> 38:25.264
No, it doesn't work.

38:27.683 --> 38:30.143
Keep at it. You'll crack it eventually.

39:11.852 --> 39:13.103
Left on Division.

39:37.836 --> 39:39.129
I gotta clear you first.

39:40.964 --> 39:41.965
Okay.

39:43.175 --> 39:45.469
- Can't just waltz up there with a guy--
- Okay.

40:23.465 --> 40:24.800
<i>Nope, not tonight.</i>

40:24.800 --> 40:25.884
It's not about that.

40:25.884 --> 40:27.261
<i>I'm sure it's not.</i>

40:27.261 --> 40:29.721
Come on, really.
This is real. I need help.

40:30.514 --> 40:31.765
<i>What kind of help?</i>

40:33.058 --> 40:34.101
Well...

40:53.287 --> 40:55.414
So... yeah.

40:56.248 --> 40:57.875
<i>Hold on, I'm coming down.</i>

41:12.055 --> 41:13.974
What happens to the kid after he talks?

41:14.558 --> 41:16.810
If he talks, my job's done.

41:16.810 --> 41:18.395
So, this other guy kills him?

41:29.823 --> 41:32.075
- Do you vouch for him?
- He's been all right.

41:32.659 --> 41:35.370
I'm not gonna vouch for him.
I-- You know, can't go that far.

41:35.996 --> 41:37.247
He's like-- You know--

41:37.247 --> 41:39.833
He's like one of those guys, you know?

41:39.833 --> 41:41.627
No, I don't know. One of what guys?

41:41.627 --> 41:44.171
One of those guys
who thinks he's, like, some genius.

41:44.171 --> 41:47.716
- Got it all figured out, you know?
- Yeah, I'm familiar with that type.

41:47.716 --> 41:49.885
I don't wanna fix this kid up
just so you can put a bullet in his--

41:49.885 --> 41:52.596
He's had his moment, you know,
where he was the go-to guy,

41:52.596 --> 41:55.933
the hot-shit guy,
but that wore off a long time ago,

41:55.933 --> 41:57.893
and no one's told him yet.

41:57.893 --> 42:00.020
Probably lives in
a single-bedroom apartment,

42:00.020 --> 42:03.899
watching old black-and-white movies till
he falls asleep 'cause he's so lonely.

42:04.858 --> 42:05.859
Hello, June.

42:13.116 --> 42:13.951
Hello.

42:14.993 --> 42:16.370
You didn't pick up.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.038
I know.

42:19.498 --> 42:20.749
Is there really a kid in your trunk?

42:20.749 --> 42:22.793
- How long have you two been--
- Not what you think.

42:22.793 --> 42:24.586
You told him it was exclusive.

42:24.586 --> 42:25.587
Are there more?

42:25.587 --> 42:28.882
Is there an OD'ing kid in your trunk?
Because if there is, then this--

42:28.882 --> 42:29.925
- Was he before me?
- Yes.

42:29.925 --> 42:31.093
- Yes?
- Yes?

42:31.093 --> 42:32.719
- No. Yes?
- Yes.

42:32.719 --> 42:36.265
Then can we take care of the OD'ing kid
first, you fucking lunatics?

42:42.771 --> 42:44.857
You need to be careful.
Both of you need to be.

42:44.857 --> 42:47.568
There are people out there.
If they saw you two together, I--

42:47.568 --> 42:49.194
You said it was exclusive.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.697
What? You did!

43:23.270 --> 43:24.354
Shit.

43:28.483 --> 43:30.110
Come on, bring him in here.

43:33.405 --> 43:35.741
- And careful of your back.
- Yep.

43:37.993 --> 43:39.995
All right. On three. You ready?

43:40.704 --> 43:44.208
Wait. One, two, three, right?
Not one, two, three, go?

43:45.125 --> 43:46.960
- Of course not.
- Good.

43:47.586 --> 43:49.755
One, two, three.

43:57.554 --> 43:58.972
Do you know what he took?

43:58.972 --> 44:00.474
- No.
- I'm not sure.

44:02.017 --> 44:04.019
Well, it must have been
some bad combination

44:04.019 --> 44:06.939
or something extremely pure.

44:07.773 --> 44:09.858
God, it's like he doesn't even
have a heartbeat.

44:10.526 --> 44:12.569
I know a lot of paramedics
would have called him.

44:13.070 --> 44:14.404
Really?

44:14.404 --> 44:16.323
- We just need him to talk.
- Let me get this straight.

44:16.323 --> 44:18.867
You're saying it's like
he took some kind of a magic drug?

44:18.867 --> 44:21.411
- So, how many--
- Makes your heartbeat so slow that...

44:21.411 --> 44:23.497
How many clowns
you got running through this joint?

44:23.497 --> 44:25.499
Now is-- It's really not the time.

44:25.499 --> 44:28.460
- Why didn't you pick up when I called?
- Okay, both of you out. Now.

44:30.796 --> 44:31.880
Out.

45:28.687 --> 45:29.855
Did you know?

45:32.941 --> 45:34.318
I had my suspicions.

45:34.902 --> 45:35.777
Yeah.

45:35.777 --> 45:39.156
Never saw anyone,
never heard anything, so I didn't ask.

45:40.908 --> 45:42.868
If it makes you feel any better,
she is the best.

45:44.870 --> 45:45.787
Sure.

45:49.333 --> 45:52.586
My first guy, I came in to get
a bullet pulled out of my side,

45:52.586 --> 45:54.046
and he wants to put me under.

45:54.838 --> 45:55.964
I said, "Fuck no."

45:56.840 --> 45:58.091
Come to find out,

45:59.009 --> 46:01.136
he's taking people's kidneys
without asking them.

46:02.638 --> 46:03.889
People are waking up and thinking,

46:03.889 --> 46:07.267
"Hey, that's a big scar
for getting a bullet pulled."

46:10.270 --> 46:11.271
She saved my life.

46:12.397 --> 46:13.273
No kidding.

46:13.273 --> 46:15.859
Yeah. Shrapnel, inch away from my spine.

46:15.859 --> 46:17.736
Spent two weeks
in the basement recovering.

46:19.613 --> 46:20.656
Back in October?

46:22.783 --> 46:23.992
Maybe. How would you know that?

46:25.244 --> 46:26.411
I was here.

46:27.329 --> 46:28.372
Come on.

46:29.039 --> 46:31.542
I was wondering why
she didn't let me near the cellar.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.170
- She is the best.
- She is.

46:37.506 --> 46:40.092
I guess I knew it wasn't exclusive.

46:40.843 --> 46:42.719
- What are the odds?
- Right?

46:44.012 --> 46:47.140
Both of us sleeping with
the same Chinatown doctor.

46:51.520 --> 46:53.730
Were you-- you two not--

47:01.029 --> 47:02.030
Stop him!

47:21.633 --> 47:22.718
Go right at the--

47:53.999 --> 47:55.250
- Take the--
- I know.

48:50.514 --> 48:51.348
Hello.

50:24.358 --> 50:25.734
Come back here!

50:35.285 --> 50:37.329
Stop running!

51:07.651 --> 51:08.485
Shit.

52:39.284 --> 52:40.160
Fuck!

53:04.560 --> 53:05.561
Get in the car.

53:08.355 --> 53:09.439
Fucker.

53:11.233 --> 53:14.278
Hey, asshole! What are you doing?

53:14.278 --> 53:15.237
Come on.

53:23.579 --> 53:24.621
Who are you guys?

53:29.543 --> 53:30.878
<i>No!</i>

53:30.878 --> 53:32.713
- Come on. We just need to--
- <i>No!</i>

53:42.472 --> 53:43.765
Hey! Dum-dums!

53:45.976 --> 53:46.977
Catch.

53:47.811 --> 53:49.897
Take two of the big ones
every couple of hours

53:49.897 --> 53:54.026
and one of the small ones every six.
And lots of water.

53:55.110 --> 53:58.530
Also, I'm not sleeping with him.
He's just fucking with you.

54:02.534 --> 54:04.077
Yeah. I was just fucking with you.

54:28.018 --> 54:29.019
No.

54:29.645 --> 54:31.855
- Come on. You got a place.
- Maybe I do.

54:31.855 --> 54:33.148
Of course you do.

54:34.316 --> 54:35.317
Knock it off!

54:36.068 --> 54:37.819
- You know what you sound like?
- What?

54:39.154 --> 54:41.073
You sound like a guy who's got a place.

54:42.366 --> 54:45.160
You got a place. Let's go to your place.

54:45.160 --> 54:47.412
- We're not going to my place.
- Why not?

54:47.412 --> 54:49.122
That's the point of having a place.

54:51.124 --> 54:52.125
Exactly.

55:15.649 --> 55:16.650
Okay.

55:21.738 --> 55:24.116
- What the fuck?
- Get dressed.

55:43.594 --> 55:44.595
Come on.

55:48.348 --> 55:49.349
Come on.

56:03.071 --> 56:07.034
<i>So that all those who come to Christ
may enter into his kingdom.</i>

56:07.034 --> 56:08.368
Need a room.

56:08.368 --> 56:11.413
- Love Nest, Arabian Nights, or Safari?
- Excuse me?

56:13.624 --> 56:16.210
Love Nest, Arabian Nights, or Safari?

56:16.210 --> 56:18.504
Love Nest, Arabian Nights
are three minimum.

56:18.504 --> 56:20.547
Safari I can do by the hour.

56:20.547 --> 56:23.884
<i>Into the family of God and are sanctified.</i>

56:25.511 --> 56:26.512
He's not a prostitute.

56:32.726 --> 56:33.936
Sit down.

56:40.984 --> 56:43.445
So, how do you wanna do this?

56:43.445 --> 56:45.781
'Cause I've never
really done it like this be--

56:45.781 --> 56:47.991
I mean, I could start, I guess, and then--

56:47.991 --> 56:51.370
- Then I just jump in when it feels right.
- Yeah. Unless you wanna start and then--

56:51.370 --> 56:55.249
No, you go. You go. You got this.
I'll just follow your lead.

56:58.585 --> 56:59.670
Okay.

57:08.428 --> 57:09.972
- Where--
- So--

57:36.999 --> 57:38.208
Where'd you get the drugs?

57:40.043 --> 57:41.879
I don't know what you're talking about.

57:43.088 --> 57:44.089
Okay.

57:45.757 --> 57:48.302
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I don't know.

57:48.927 --> 57:50.971
I don't know anything about any drugs.

57:52.639 --> 57:55.475
- Where did you get the drugs?
- I don't--

57:56.977 --> 57:57.978
Talk, asshole.

58:00.689 --> 58:01.690
Show him the rest.

58:03.650 --> 58:04.943
Come on.

58:11.742 --> 58:12.743
Huh?

58:15.662 --> 58:16.663
Now.

58:19.791 --> 58:20.834
Those aren't mine.

58:22.461 --> 58:24.379
Can I talk to you in the hall,
just for a minute?

58:32.638 --> 58:33.931
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

58:34.556 --> 58:36.350
You asked the same thing three times.
I thought this could--

58:36.350 --> 58:38.977
He didn't know we had the drugs.
He was panicked. We had leverage.

58:38.977 --> 58:40.687
He wasn't panicked.
He wasn't gonna say anything.

58:40.687 --> 58:43.106
- You don't know that.
- How many times were you gonna ask?

58:43.106 --> 58:45.192
Ten times? Twenty time-- Hey!

58:47.694 --> 58:50.155
You know, there's an art to this
you may not realize.

58:50.155 --> 58:52.115
What, the art of saying
the same thing over and over?

58:52.115 --> 58:55.285
- Okay. Well, let's see your technique.
- I'm not gonna show you my technique.

58:55.285 --> 58:56.912
- Because you don't have a technique.
- No.

58:56.912 --> 58:58.413
No? Then why?

58:59.790 --> 59:00.874
Because you'll steal it.

59:01.875 --> 59:04.711
- I'll steal it? You think I'll steal it?
- There you go, repeating again.

59:04.711 --> 59:06.463
You don't have a technique.

59:06.463 --> 59:07.965
I do, and it involves a little bit more

59:07.965 --> 59:09.925
than saying the same
thing over and over again.

59:12.636 --> 59:14.054
I showed you my luggage cart trick.

59:14.721 --> 59:17.975
- You didn't show me. I saw it.
- Yeah, but you liked it. You'll use it.

59:19.017 --> 59:22.521
- Maybe.
- Come on. Admit it. It was cool.

59:23.480 --> 59:25.399
- Okay, fine. It was very cool.
- Yeah, it's cool.

59:28.861 --> 59:30.320
So, what's the next move here?

59:31.238 --> 59:32.990
Can't we just get to it?

59:32.990 --> 59:34.283
What do you mean?

59:34.283 --> 59:35.617
Like, I don't wanna be here.

59:37.327 --> 59:38.996
You miss your place?

59:38.996 --> 59:42.249
I feel like I'm getting syphilis just
standing here. Let's just get to it.

59:43.667 --> 59:44.835
- Really?
- Why not?

59:47.337 --> 59:49.214
- Let's get to it.
- Great.

59:50.841 --> 59:52.384
Where'd you get the fucking drugs?

59:52.384 --> 59:54.261
- ...the fucking drugs, you asshole?
- Lagrange!

59:54.261 --> 59:55.721
They call him Lagrange!

59:55.721 --> 59:57.014
Lagrange?

59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.726
- What about him?
- They're his-- or they were-- the drugs.

01:00:00.726 --> 01:00:03.353
- Bullshit. How?
- How? What do you mean? How what?

01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:05.564
How does someone like you
get involved with one of the biggest

01:00:05.564 --> 01:00:06.940
- drug runners in the city?
- Yeah.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.152
Well-- So, I'm not a prostitute, okay.
That's not what's happening.

01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:11.236
How did you get the drugs?

01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:16.033
Fuck you! I'm fucking trying to explain.
Just let me explain. Let me explain, okay?

01:00:17.868 --> 01:00:19.119
Can I get a glass of water?

01:00:22.414 --> 01:00:25.334
- I mean, she did say hydrate.
- Yeah, I know. I--

01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:27.961
Fine. Fine. Fuck it.

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:29.046
Thank you.

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:30.714
Yeah.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.323
Thank you.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:01.411
Oh, boy.

01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:04.748
Oh, my goodness.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.011
Okay.

01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:23.433
So, I wake up--

01:01:23.433 --> 01:01:25.727
Jesus Christ, kid. You woke up--
You gotta start the story there?

01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:27.396
- Just let him talk.
- I-- Yeah.

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:29.147
It's not gonna make sense unless
I tell you the whole thing.

01:01:29.147 --> 01:01:30.399
So, you think
you need to add in the detail

01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:32.192
that you woke up in case it wasn't clear?

01:01:32.192 --> 01:01:35.404
- Yes, I do. It's how I started my day.
- That's how everyone starts their day!

01:01:35.404 --> 01:01:38.240
What he's saying is take a minute
to think about what's

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.909
the most important part of the story
and leave the rest out.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.703
- Well, I--
- Hey!

01:01:42.703 --> 01:01:44.246
Think about it.

01:01:44.872 --> 01:01:45.873
Right.

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:51.879
Well, so I'm-- I'm getting up

01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:53.755
and I'm-- I'm getting out of bed and--

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:57.926
...you know, my room is a mess
and I'm not exactly hungover,

01:01:57.926 --> 01:01:59.678
but I'm still feeling a little bit-- Shit!

01:01:59.678 --> 01:02:03.182
Fuck! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Okay. I-I-I-- Yes.

01:02:03.182 --> 01:02:04.975
- I leave my house and--
- No.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:07.060
All right. Just let him
do the whole thing. He can't do it.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.770
- I-- No, I can do it.
- No, you can't do it.

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:11.440
- Yeah, I can.
- Just go fast, all right?

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.903
- Okay. Yes. I--
- Now, what the fuck happened?

01:02:15.903 --> 01:02:17.613
Yes. Okay. So, I'm, like--

01:02:17.613 --> 01:02:20.407
I wasn't trying to make any
money or anything, like, be a drug dealer.

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:23.035
Like, I've been taking classes at Pace.
I've been trying to learn business.

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:25.537
Some business classes 'cause, you know,

01:02:25.537 --> 01:02:28.290
people are gonna try and fuck you with,
like, law and legal shit unless, you know,

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.292
you know how it works.
So, I'm taking these classes,

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:31.960
and there's this dude there and he's,
like, legit.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.546
He is from some real shit but he's, like,
so smart also.

01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:39.009
I mean he's, like, basically a genius
smart, and today his fucking mom died.

01:02:39.009 --> 01:02:42.804
Like, he got this call in class
and his fucking mom was in the hospital,

01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:44.890
and she fucking died because they didn't,

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:47.267
like, give her the right medicine
or some shit.

01:02:47.267 --> 01:02:48.393
Like, they fucked up.

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:50.687
So I'm just like,
"Dude, whatever you need, dude."

01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:52.773
And he, like, trusts me.
Like, we hang out and shit.

01:02:52.773 --> 01:02:55.192
And I told you he's legit,
like, no fucking around.

01:02:55.192 --> 01:02:56.818
So, he's like--

01:02:56.818 --> 01:02:59.363
he's like, "I'm supposed to do
this drop for my boss and now I can't."

01:02:59.363 --> 01:03:00.989
And I was like,
"Say no more, I will do it."

01:03:00.989 --> 01:03:02.699
Like, I don't do this kind of shit.

01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:07.246
So he gives me the shit and I'm like,
"Fuck, are you fucking serious?"

01:03:07.246 --> 01:03:10.916
But his mom just fucking died,
so I say, "Okay, dude. I'll do it."

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:14.169
So I'm killing some time
before I get the address for the drop.

01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:16.588
And I'll admit it,
I'm feeling pretty fucking cool,

01:03:16.588 --> 01:03:18.131
but also it's scary and shit,

01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:20.050
and my heart's, like,
fucking pounding out of my chest.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:23.136
So I duck into this bar.
It's, like, this hotel bar,

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:24.847
and I'm kind of feeling myself 'cause,

01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:27.558
like, I'm on some real shit,
and it's, like, people are noticing.

01:03:27.558 --> 01:03:29.476
Like, girls are fucking noticing, like,

01:03:29.476 --> 01:03:31.395
I've got the fucking juice
all of a sudden.

01:03:31.395 --> 01:03:34.606
And it's, like-- I didn't even, like,
take a shower this morning, you know?

01:03:34.606 --> 01:03:37.109
Like-- Like I was trying to say before.

01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:40.529
And it's, like, three fucking girls, they
just start talking to me, like, hot girls.

01:03:40.529 --> 01:03:42.489
Like, I've got the fucking juice.

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.908
They're buying me drinks
and shit 'cause I'm broke.

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:46.785
And then, I'm coming out of the bathroom,

01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:48.453
and this older lady,
she's fucking hot too,

01:03:48.453 --> 01:03:51.039
is straight up like,
"Do you wanna come up to my room?"

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:55.335
And I'm like, "Yes, yes, yes. Of course."
This is my life. Why not live it?

01:03:55.335 --> 01:03:58.255
And it's, like,
Diego's mom just fucking died,

01:03:58.255 --> 01:03:59.923
so I'm thinking about my life,

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:03.343
and I'm thinking about how
it could just all go away at any time.

01:04:03.343 --> 01:04:06.388
And so, we're partying and I fucking--

01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:08.390
I just wanted to see
what it was like, you know?

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:10.642
It's like there was magic in there
wrapped up in plastic,

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:13.353
like, it was radiating out,
and I just wanted to try it.

01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:15.522
Just the tiniest amount
'cause it's, like--

01:04:15.522 --> 01:04:17.983
Today was, like,
the first day that I ever felt cool.

01:04:17.983 --> 01:04:19.776
Not that you guys would understand.

01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:21.361
You're, like,
the coolest guys I've ever seen.

01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:23.530
But I was so careful.
Like, I was so careful.

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.866
You would never know that I tried it,
but I did.

01:04:25.866 --> 01:04:27.868
I did try it,
and it didn't make me feel cool.

01:04:27.868 --> 01:04:30.412
It just-- I just, like--

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:41.507
Is that it?

01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:45.469
I think so, yeah.

01:04:45.469 --> 01:04:48.138
- Okay, then.
- What's the address for the drop?

01:04:49.348 --> 01:04:50.724
- I don't know.
- Where's your phone?

01:04:52.226 --> 01:04:53.310
I hid it.

01:04:54.102 --> 01:04:55.229
In the hotel?

01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:57.272
- No, before I left.
- Why?

01:04:58.273 --> 01:05:01.485
In case something happened. I hid
my wallet too, in case I got picked up.

01:05:01.485 --> 01:05:04.655
How were you gonna get the address of
the drop if you don't have your phone?

01:05:04.655 --> 01:05:06.240
The pager.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.825
- Pager?
- Where's your pager?

01:05:08.825 --> 01:05:11.453
I don't have a pager.
What's this, like, the '90s?

01:05:11.453 --> 01:05:12.704
Who has the pager?

01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:14.414
- No one.
- No one has the pager?

01:05:14.414 --> 01:05:16.166
- No.
- Where is it?

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:17.876
Diego left it for me at his work.

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:20.087
- Where?
- It's called Club Ice.

01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:25.050
Used to be the something... Palazzo.
I don't know.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.593
He bartends there sometimes.

01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:32.224
This guy, Diego, why would he trust you?

01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:37.896
I guess 'cause we're friends.

01:05:40.732 --> 01:05:43.360
Do you guys--
You don't think it's too late?

01:05:45.737 --> 01:05:48.657
Early, late.
You took the job, you gave your word.

01:05:48.657 --> 01:05:49.992
You're gonna finish it.

01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:53.745
Right.

01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:01.962
Are you guys seeing that?

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.368
How long have you both
worked together for?

01:06:37.289 --> 01:06:39.208
- A long time.
- I stopped counting.

01:06:39.208 --> 01:06:40.292
Really?

01:06:42.044 --> 01:06:43.795
Well, yeah, you can tell.

01:06:46.423 --> 01:06:48.717
- Is that so?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:51.386
Yeah, you got, like,
basically the same clothes,

01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:53.597
kinda talk the same, you know.

01:06:54.848 --> 01:06:56.308
You're, like, basically the same guy.

01:07:01.313 --> 01:07:03.607
Hey, everything's gonna be okay, right,
after I make the drop?

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:07.694
'Cause I just--
I have a really big exam next week.

01:07:07.694 --> 01:07:09.279
I really don't wanna screw that up.

01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:11.031
You won't have to worry about that.

01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:35.430
I'll be two seconds.

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:37.975
- You're hilarious.
- What? No, no. I won't run.

01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:40.018
- Well, in that case...
- No, seriously. I can just go in.

01:07:40.018 --> 01:07:41.603
I'll get the pager. It'll be fine.

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:43.689
All right? I promise.
I'm not gonna-- What?

01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:58.620
Is that...

01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:00.539
Croatian.

01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:14.344
Why you both looking
at each other like that?

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:17.014
You did that thing down in Gowanus,
didn't you?

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:18.599
No. Why would you say that?

01:08:18.599 --> 01:08:20.725
I wondered why he didn't call me.
And when I heard

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:23.437
- what a shit show that was--
- No, that wasn't a shit show.

01:08:23.437 --> 01:08:24.770
So you did do Gowanus?

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:26.023
What is happening?

01:08:26.023 --> 01:08:27.399
Not sure what happened to the body though.

01:08:28.942 --> 01:08:32.404
You know that explosion
at the evidence warehouse in the Bronx?

01:08:33.322 --> 01:08:34.656
You're kidding. That was you?

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:37.283
Yeah.

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:38.368
That was in October.

01:08:39.118 --> 01:08:41.037
- You were recovering at June's.
- Yeah.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.999
Shit. She tried to warn me tonight.

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:48.002
She said there were people out there
who, if they saw us t--

01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:50.380
We need to get the pager.
Why can't we just go in and get the pager?

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.381
- Because we can't.
- Why not?

01:08:52.381 --> 01:08:54.009
Is it 'cause of the drugs?
In case they're searching people?

01:08:54.009 --> 01:08:55.719
'Cause one of you guys could
just wait in here with the drugs.

01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:57.970
- I'm not leaving him with all the drugs.
- I'm not leaving him.

01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.348
You don't trust your own partner?

01:09:00.474 --> 01:09:01.642
Where is it?

01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:03.519
- What?
- The pager.

01:09:03.519 --> 01:09:04.603
It's at the--

01:09:10.067 --> 01:09:11.609
No. I'm not telling.

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.028
No fucking around, kid.

01:09:13.028 --> 01:09:15.029
- Where is the pager?
- Tell me what's going on.

01:09:15.029 --> 01:09:16.615
- No. Where's the pager?
- Why can't you tell me?

01:09:16.615 --> 01:09:18.033
- We can't.
- Why not?

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:19.243
- Because we can't.
- Why?

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:21.203
- Because we--
- 'Cause we're not partners.

01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:23.205
What?

01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:27.542
There is an expectation
of discretion in our line of work.

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:29.461
A kind of monasticism.

01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:32.005
At least the way I learned it.

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:34.633
Same.

01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:40.389
When you hire someone to do what we do,

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.432
you want someone who works alone.

01:09:42.432 --> 01:09:45.060
No connections. No conflicting loyalties.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.312
It's the only way you can be trusted,
is to trust no one.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:50.314
But in that building back there
is a very scary,

01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:56.238
very violent man who, it turns out,
we have both worked for in the past.

01:09:56.822 --> 01:09:59.575
- And if he saw us together--
- If he even suspected

01:09:59.575 --> 01:10:00.701
I knew what he knew...

01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:01.994
And I knew what he knew.

01:10:01.994 --> 01:10:05.622
Then he would, without hesitation,
have us killed immediately.

01:10:05.622 --> 01:10:06.832
Or he'd kill us himself.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.585
So you're secret partners?

01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:13.255
- We're not secret partners.
- We're not partners. Jesus Christ.

01:10:14.089 --> 01:10:15.924
All right. Here's what gonna happen.

01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:19.052
We keep the drugs with us.

01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:20.596
And we all go in.

01:10:20.596 --> 01:10:22.264
No one leaves anyone's sight.

01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:24.266
And you get that goddamn pager.

01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:28.562
I'm going to pray to Christ that
Dimitri doesn't see you and me together.

01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:30.772
Dumbest, most dangerous plan.

01:10:32.524 --> 01:10:34.026
Are you really not partners?

01:10:53.629 --> 01:10:54.880
The ladder's really cold.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.298
What?

01:10:56.298 --> 01:10:57.508
The ladder's really cold.

01:10:57.508 --> 01:10:58.592
Shut up.

01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:38.442
I'm friends with Diego,
and he left something for me.

01:12:38.442 --> 01:12:39.526
- What?
- He left a pager.

01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:42.404
Diego, he left a pager for me.
It's a green pager.

01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:45.282
- Got you, man.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:12:57.085 --> 01:12:59.755
No, no, no.
It's a pager. It's right there.

01:13:06.512 --> 01:13:07.513
Can you--

01:13:25.906 --> 01:13:27.783
What are you doing behind the bar?

01:13:27.783 --> 01:13:29.910
- I wasn't doing anything.
- What are you doing behind the bar?

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.663
I was just talking to that guy over there.
No.

01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:38.752
Okay, okay.

01:14:07.197 --> 01:14:08.615
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:09.783 --> 01:14:10.909
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:13.453
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:14.705 --> 01:14:15.706
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.083
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:23.088
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:25.215
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:26.717 --> 01:14:27.551
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:30.470
Hey!

01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:33.223
Hey!

01:14:34.099 --> 01:14:35.100
Hey!

01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:37.686
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:39.563
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:42.357
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:43.108 --> 01:14:44.359
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:47.946 --> 01:14:49.656
Hey, hey, hey!

01:15:49.925 --> 01:15:54.304
No, boys, no! Everyone, calm down!

01:15:55.889 --> 01:15:57.099
What's going on here, Dimitri?

01:15:57.099 --> 01:15:59.226
- Who the fuck is this asshole?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:01.687
Boys, boys, it's fine.

01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:04.857
Everyone, calm down. Give me those.

01:16:06.817 --> 01:16:09.653
Guns are only for the wedding party.

01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:14.157
I'm sorry, baby. Please, I'm sorry...

01:16:14.157 --> 01:16:15.701
<i>...I'll fix it.</i>

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:20.080
Everyone, it's okay.

01:16:20.873 --> 01:16:22.833
They are friends.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:25.002
Yeah.

01:16:25.002 --> 01:16:26.837
Come here, both of you.

01:16:26.837 --> 01:16:28.130
Come here.

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:29.840
Start the music, please.

01:16:39.224 --> 01:16:40.225
Hey.

01:16:52.446 --> 01:16:56.825
You crash my daughter's wedding
and then you pull out guns, huh?

01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:58.202
I came to pay my respects.

01:16:58.202 --> 01:17:00.412
Wait, Dimitri, you know this asshole?

01:17:00.412 --> 01:17:06.627
Believe it or not,
you two offer not dissimilar services.

01:17:07.544 --> 01:17:10.214
With all due respect, Dimitri,
I highly doubt that.

01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:13.800
And if I ever see you again, bucko...

01:17:22.893 --> 01:17:23.894
Hey!

01:17:25.145 --> 01:17:26.146
Let's go!

01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:29.441
All right, all right, all right.

01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:36.114
Hey, leave him. Stay. Have a drink.

01:17:37.783 --> 01:17:40.494
- I got a job to do.
- I see.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:43.121
The professional.

01:17:44.498 --> 01:17:47.125
The lone wolf.

01:17:51.255 --> 01:17:52.548
Sorry for the disturbance.

01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:56.844
Congratulations
on your daughter's wedding.

01:18:00.013 --> 01:18:01.098
Sweetie.

01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:03.183
Hey, sweetie.

01:18:04.977 --> 01:18:06.687
Come here. Hey.

01:18:13.735 --> 01:18:15.028
Buddies...

01:18:26.874 --> 01:18:27.875
Hey!

01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:55.777
See?

01:18:56.862 --> 01:18:58.447
I told you I wasn't gonna run.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.867
There's no address yet.

01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:03.911
We still got some time.

01:19:10.292 --> 01:19:11.835
I wanna finish the job too.

01:19:19.384 --> 01:19:20.385
Come on.

01:19:33.315 --> 01:19:36.276
Would you shut your mouth when you chew?

01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:44.576
Okay.

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:52.876
Hey, how do you even start
doing something like this?

01:19:54.503 --> 01:19:56.505
Like what--
you know, what you guys do.

01:19:57.506 --> 01:19:58.715
What is it you think we do?

01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:01.051
Well, you fix things, right?

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.350
Like, if something's messed up or,
like, if someone, like,

01:20:09.017 --> 01:20:11.228
messes up, you, like, make it okay, right?

01:20:13.146 --> 01:20:14.147
More or less.

01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:20.529
Well, thank you.

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:32.875
Too bad you both can't work together.

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:39.089
Like, what you do must be really lonely.

01:20:46.346 --> 01:20:47.347
I'm gonna pee.

01:20:54.146 --> 01:20:59.484
So, Lagrange has a mole with Dimitri,
or Diego is playing both sides somehow.

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:05.240
- You still on this conspiracy thing?
- Diego's dead mom was a bullshit story.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.369
They're setting the kid up. But why?
And how did Lagrange get that shipment?

01:21:09.369 --> 01:21:10.954
What does it matter?

01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:13.040
- You're not curious?
- Doesn't change the job.

01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:15.000
So you're not curious?

01:21:16.293 --> 01:21:17.961
Would be a valuable piece of intel.

01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:21.548
We'd have to figure out how to play it.
We both can't know everything.

01:21:21.548 --> 01:21:23.967
Okay. Then one of us would make the drop.

01:21:23.967 --> 01:21:25.719
Then maybe we figure out
what the fuck's going on.

01:21:25.719 --> 01:21:27.346
If we get the address.

01:21:27.346 --> 01:21:30.265
If we get the address,
one of us makes the drop.

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:38.357
No.

01:21:40.484 --> 01:21:41.777
He has to do it.

01:21:41.777 --> 01:21:43.487
What? You-- No, no, no.

01:21:43.487 --> 01:21:46.198
He could run. He could talk.
There's too many variables with that kid.

01:21:46.198 --> 01:21:47.616
He has to do it.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.701
I'm not following.

01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:53.038
Sometimes the job takes care of itself.

01:21:59.044 --> 01:22:00.879
So the kid walks in and he gets shot?

01:22:02.923 --> 01:22:04.591
Because you don't wanna do it?

01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:08.178
I don't do anything I don't have to.
Especially not that.

01:22:08.178 --> 01:22:09.513
Or you've lost your nerve.

01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:14.059
I mean, this kid doesn't come home,
people are gonna look for him.

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:15.561
This way, they find him.

01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:16.478
No, no. I get it.

01:22:17.062 --> 01:22:18.605
You could just let him live.

01:22:21.024 --> 01:22:22.609
Let's say you're wrong.

01:22:23.443 --> 01:22:25.779
The kid makes the drop,
and he walks out alive.

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:30.367
Then...

01:22:37.457 --> 01:22:40.002
You know why they have
multiple shooters on a firing squad?

01:22:40.002 --> 01:22:41.503
I do.

01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:44.882
So...

01:22:44.882 --> 01:22:46.967
- I'm not asking. I don't need your help.
- I know y--

01:22:47.593 --> 01:22:49.595
I'm-- I'm offering.

01:22:49.595 --> 01:22:51.555
Why? So you can say I lost my edge?

01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:53.640
To who?

01:22:55.893 --> 01:22:58.854
I'm saying that I unders--

01:22:58.854 --> 01:23:03.734
I know what--
what that feels-- doing that.

01:23:05.194 --> 01:23:06.695
So maybe this way it would...

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:12.159
be a little less...

01:23:14.286 --> 01:23:15.287
yeah.

01:23:44.107 --> 01:23:45.192
You know it?

01:23:49.363 --> 01:23:50.531
Did it go off?

01:23:53.659 --> 01:23:54.660
Thank God.

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:57.704
Oh, my God. I thought we were dead.

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.082
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.

01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:04.086
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:24:49.715 --> 01:24:50.716
Now what?

01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:52.801
Now you go in.

01:24:55.721 --> 01:24:56.763
You guys aren't coming?

01:24:58.849 --> 01:25:01.018
You took the job. Now you gotta finish it.

01:25:05.022 --> 01:25:06.231
Right.

01:25:12.112 --> 01:25:13.238
Are you guys gonna wait for me?

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:17.576
All right.

01:25:18.327 --> 01:25:19.328
I'll be back.

01:26:22.766 --> 01:26:24.518
It could take care of itself.

01:26:45.163 --> 01:26:46.290
Fuck it.

01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:05.392
- Is that the--
- The Albanians.

01:27:10.981 --> 01:27:11.982
Fuck!

01:27:20.616 --> 01:27:21.450
Fuck!

01:27:25.454 --> 01:27:26.872
Go, go, go!

01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:38.008
You are not wolves! You are buddies!

01:27:47.184 --> 01:27:48.644
Three, two...

01:31:01.587 --> 01:31:02.588
Is everybody dead?

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:07.593
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. What the fuck?

01:31:09.052 --> 01:31:10.179
What happened?

01:31:12.097 --> 01:31:14.349
So, I'm walking up to the warehouse,
and I'm thinking to myself,

01:31:14.349 --> 01:31:15.684
like, "This is really scary."

01:31:15.684 --> 01:31:17.561
But I was thinking that I could do it,
'cause you guys

01:31:17.561 --> 01:31:19.104
gave me confidence,
and I thought that I could do it.

01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:22.608
Oh, my God.
Stop, stop. Stop. Doesn't matter.

01:31:23.734 --> 01:31:26.153
Fuck. Now what?

01:31:38.457 --> 01:31:39.666
Finish the job.

01:31:41.502 --> 01:31:42.503
What?

01:31:44.004 --> 01:31:46.298
You came here to drop off the drugs.
Do it.

01:31:47.007 --> 01:31:50.260
How am I supposed to--
What, I just put 'em anywhere?

01:31:51.512 --> 01:31:53.013
What story are you trying to tell?

01:32:03.524 --> 01:32:07.277
I'm pretty sure that this guy
over here was in charge of these guys...

01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:11.073
so maybe he had this one.

01:32:17.246 --> 01:32:18.580
I know. Yeah.

01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:37.558
And let's say this guy, maybe he...

01:32:48.902 --> 01:32:51.029
...trying to get away, you know.
He didn't even wanna be here.

01:33:35.991 --> 01:33:37.284
Looks more realistic.

01:33:47.544 --> 01:33:49.963
Let's go. You don't wanna be here
when the sun comes up.

01:33:58.013 --> 01:33:59.264
Could I get a ride home?

01:33:59.264 --> 01:34:00.349
Take the subway.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:02.768
Please.

01:34:02.768 --> 01:34:04.686
We're all taking the subway.

01:34:43.058 --> 01:34:44.685
You got blood on your sweater.

01:35:20.262 --> 01:35:21.263
Fucker.

01:35:26.852 --> 01:35:28.103
I didn't care.

01:35:33.483 --> 01:35:35.319
What are we gonna tell my dad?

01:35:35.319 --> 01:35:37.112
That nothing unusual happened tonight,

01:35:37.112 --> 01:35:39.823
and if either of you
were to say anything differently,

01:35:39.823 --> 01:35:42.534
we're gonna flip a coin
to see who's gonna kill you

01:35:42.534 --> 01:35:44.328
and who's gonna kill your dad.

01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:51.376
Was nice to meet you guys.

01:35:51.376 --> 01:35:52.461
You never met us.

01:35:54.087 --> 01:35:55.088
Right.

01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:18.529
Hey, Dad. These guys
need to talk to you about something.

01:36:23.116 --> 01:36:26.245
So, Frank is doing this movie,
<i>Manchurian Candidate.</i>

01:36:26.245 --> 01:36:29.456
He's notorious for just doing one take.

01:36:29.456 --> 01:36:34.002
And the director, he says,
"That was perfect. Let's do one more."

01:36:35.379 --> 01:36:36.797
Frank says, "I'll tell you what,

01:36:37.589 --> 01:36:40.968
if it's so perfect,
why don't you print it twice?"

01:36:42.511 --> 01:36:43.804
You like it black?

01:36:43.804 --> 01:36:45.305
Black's fine.

01:36:45.305 --> 01:36:46.223
Yeah.

01:36:46.223 --> 01:36:47.724
Hey. Get back. Come on.

01:36:47.724 --> 01:36:49.059
Little. Come on.

01:36:59.528 --> 01:37:03.198
So... what's this all about?

01:37:09.037 --> 01:37:10.247
Wanna grab some breakfast?

01:37:10.956 --> 01:37:12.165
I know a place.

01:37:12.165 --> 01:37:13.709
Brighton Beach,
across from where they had the--

01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:15.377
Exactly. I love that place.

01:37:15.961 --> 01:37:18.755
That was a very intimidating
performance in there, by the way.

01:37:19.423 --> 01:37:21.508
You like that thing with the pliers?

01:37:21.508 --> 01:37:22.926
Might even steal it.

01:37:22.926 --> 01:37:24.386
You like blini?

01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:25.762
Love a blini.

01:37:33.437 --> 01:37:34.563
Yeah.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.192
There we go. Thank you.

01:37:40.110 --> 01:37:42.112
- A tracker.
- In the goddamn drugs.

01:37:42.112 --> 01:37:43.780
Should've caught that immediately.

01:37:44.865 --> 01:37:48.243
So, did Lagrange even
steal the drugs, or were--

01:37:48.243 --> 01:37:49.328
I--

01:37:49.912 --> 01:37:51.663
So now you don't care
who stole the shipment?

01:37:51.663 --> 01:37:53.957
I don't think it matters
as long as the kid stays quiet.

01:37:57.878 --> 01:38:02.049
You do realize one of us,
most likely, eventually...

01:38:04.176 --> 01:38:06.595
Yeah. Probably. Cross that bridge...

01:38:06.595 --> 01:38:08.013
If he can be killed.

01:38:11.266 --> 01:38:13.310
Yeah. Well...

01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:14.603
Lucky fucker.

01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:17.481
Well, that was a night.

01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:20.400
Yeah.

01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:33.872
Yeah.

01:38:34.915 --> 01:38:35.958
All right, then.

01:38:39.753 --> 01:38:42.506
So, what did she say to you
to get you to work with me?

01:38:42.506 --> 01:38:44.967
What'd she say? She had all the leverage.

01:38:44.967 --> 01:38:46.802
She said that I didn't have a choice.

01:38:49.805 --> 01:38:50.806
All right.

01:38:53.308 --> 01:38:56.103
"You take a job, you give your word,
and that word's the measure of the man."

01:39:08.198 --> 01:39:09.283
Who called you?

01:39:10.075 --> 01:39:11.326
What?

01:39:12.119 --> 01:39:13.412
In the car to June's.

01:39:13.412 --> 01:39:14.913
- Who called you?
- Who called you?

01:39:15.622 --> 01:39:16.623
It was your guy.

01:39:16.623 --> 01:39:17.833
My guy?

01:39:17.833 --> 01:39:19.960
The guy that Pam got your number from.
Your guy.

01:39:20.544 --> 01:39:23.046
- So, she must have called him.
- But then why call me?

01:39:23.922 --> 01:39:24.923
Who called--

01:39:26.383 --> 01:39:28.218
You're saying the DA got your number--

01:39:28.719 --> 01:39:29.678
No.

01:39:29.678 --> 01:39:30.846
Yeah.

01:39:33.515 --> 01:39:34.850
We have the same guy?

01:39:39.771 --> 01:39:41.690
We both have the same guy.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.030
But why does he care?
It's just a cleanup job.

01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:50.324
- He doesn't. Unless--
- Unless he knew about the drugs.

01:39:50.324 --> 01:39:52.826
Kid's dead, can't make the drop,
so he calls us.

01:39:52.826 --> 01:39:55.412
- One at a time, but nobody answers.
- So, he sent someone else.

01:39:55.412 --> 01:39:56.955
- Chinatown.
- Sees the kid's alive.

01:39:56.955 --> 01:39:58.498
- Hard to miss. The plan's back on track.
- Except,

01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:01.210
- we're on our way to Dimitri's--
- Who would have killed us, except--

01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:02.961
We didn't fool Dimitri. He was tipped off.

01:40:02.961 --> 01:40:04.254
Bodyguard didn't get the memo.

01:40:04.254 --> 01:40:05.714
The Albanians don't make a move because--

01:40:05.714 --> 01:40:07.466
- The tracker's not even on.
- Until the page.

01:40:07.466 --> 01:40:09.176
- It was all a setup.
- It looks like Lagrange

01:40:09.176 --> 01:40:10.427
is trying to move the stolen drugs.

01:40:10.427 --> 01:40:11.762
And the Albanians go to war with Lagrange,

01:40:11.762 --> 01:40:13.639
- no competition.
- The city shuts down.

01:40:13.639 --> 01:40:15.390
- People get arrested.
- I know a DA who's tough on crime.

01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:17.017
- ...the real thief to clean up.
- ...who can clean drug money.

01:40:17.017 --> 01:40:18.393
Great things to come.

01:40:18.393 --> 01:40:19.978
No wonder they wanted
the cameras in the room.

01:40:19.978 --> 01:40:21.104
He wanted to know who knew.

01:40:21.855 --> 01:40:23.815
But the kid turns
the ambush into a shoot-out.

01:40:24.483 --> 01:40:27.319
We were supposed to take the fall.
He didn't think we'd send the kid in.

01:40:30.781 --> 01:40:32.241
We were getting cleaned.

01:41:00.352 --> 01:41:02.271
- He's not gonna let us out of here alive.
- Nope.

01:41:03.272 --> 01:41:05.357
They're really
not taking any chances, are they?

01:41:05.357 --> 01:41:06.400
No.

01:41:08.443 --> 01:41:11.113
You know, I never did catch your name.

01:41:12.614 --> 01:41:14.283
I tell you what, we survive this...

01:41:15.492 --> 01:41:16.535
Deal.

01:41:21.123 --> 01:41:22.165
Ready?

01:41:23.292 --> 01:41:24.293
Yeah.

01:42:27.814 --> 01:42:29.149
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:31.693
- Yeah.
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:42:37.282 --> 01:42:38.283
I got you.

01:42:45.374 --> 01:42:46.416
Fuck.
