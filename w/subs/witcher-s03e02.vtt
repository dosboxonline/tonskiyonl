WEBVTT

00:07.916 --> 00:09.166
[man 1] Hang 'em high!

00:09.250 --> 00:10.958
[crowd cheering]

00:14.208 --> 00:16.041
[man 1] Snap their spindly necks!

00:16.125 --> 00:18.458
-[crowd cheering]
-[woman 1] Yeah! Drop them!

00:18.541 --> 00:20.666
[man 2] To the brave boys of Temeria!

00:20.750 --> 00:25.083
[man 3] Kick those Kaedwenian arses
back to their icy shithole of a state!

00:25.166 --> 00:27.166
[cheering]

00:29.041 --> 00:30.750
[woman 2] Traveled far, friend?

00:30.833 --> 00:33.041
I go where King Demavend sends me.

00:33.125 --> 00:34.250
Royal messenger?

00:35.250 --> 00:37.416
I suppose
you'll be taking my best horse, then?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.250
Well, I'll leave him at the next post.
Under the name of Aplegatt.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.000
Lame and over-ridden, no doubt.

00:45.166 --> 00:49.833
Well, give us a draught of your finest ale
and… I'll add it to the king's bill.

00:49.916 --> 00:50.875
Huh.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.541
Seems festive in these parts.

00:54.541 --> 00:56.125
[innkeeper] Hanging's good for business.

00:56.750 --> 01:00.291
That spy was our fourth execution
in as many days.

01:01.125 --> 01:04.208
-One Kaedwenian, one Aerdirnian…
-[man 4 whispers] Look at those eyes.

01:04.291 --> 01:05.916
[woman 3] Look at her!

01:06.000 --> 01:09.875
[innkeeper] See, that's the problem.
What's a mage doing all the way out here?

01:09.958 --> 01:12.833
She should be focusing
on keeping the Royal peace,

01:12.916 --> 01:15.500
not swannin' idly around the countryside.

01:16.083 --> 01:19.791
[chuckling] Looking like that, though,
she can idle around me tonight.

01:19.875 --> 01:24.291
You do know that they keep their beauty
by bathin' in human blood every night, eh?

01:24.916 --> 01:26.083
Thanks for the ale.

01:27.125 --> 01:28.375
I'll be seein' you.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.791
[Yennefer] Straight to Tissaia.
No portals.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.625
[woman] Yes, my lady.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.041
[laughter and cheering continue]

01:44.916 --> 01:46.083
Cold one, isn't it?

01:49.291 --> 01:50.625
God speed, miss.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.208
I was just… wishin' you a safe journey.

01:58.041 --> 01:59.375
[echoing screams]

02:02.875 --> 02:04.833
-[screaming]
-[horse neighs]

02:05.416 --> 02:07.291
-[thunder crashes]
-[Aplegatt screams]

02:07.916 --> 02:09.541
-[thunder fades]
-[horse snorts]

02:13.375 --> 02:14.958
-[whispers] I saw you.
-What?

02:15.041 --> 02:19.708
Apologies, good sir. Never mind the girl.
She was kicked in the head by a horse.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.375
-Hasn't been right since.
-[whimpers] No.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.958
There was a tower. An arrow struck you.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.833
Remember I said we need to keep
a low profile? That was not that.

02:27.916 --> 02:30.625
-I cannot control my visions.
-You can control who you blab to.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.750
Stop hauling me like I'm a mewling brat.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.791
I saw his death
and I need to go back there.

02:35.875 --> 02:38.083
What if his death
prevented a greater harm?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.541
What would the consequence be then,
my ugly one?

02:42.333 --> 02:43.458
I don't know.

02:43.541 --> 02:44.750
I don't know either.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.833
But changing destiny
is a weighty business.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.083
Your visions are becoming more frequent.

02:51.625 --> 02:54.208
It's only a matter of time
before someone finds us.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.625
[sighs] We need to get to Aretuza
more quickly.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.083
You're afraid.

03:00.666 --> 03:04.666
I promised Geralt I'd keep you safe.
We need something untraceable.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.125
We're going shopping.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.500
[steady heartbeat]

03:26.083 --> 03:29.416
[Jaskier] I'll never get over how cute
they look, you know? For monsters.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.708
I mean, they've got
these little teddy bear faces,

03:31.791 --> 03:34.166
and they're like…
[squeakily] "No, please, don't hurt me!"

03:34.250 --> 03:36.333
And then, wham, fangs.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.541
Just, like, a boatload of fangs.
All up in your business.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.250
How many people
did you say this thing ate?

03:42.333 --> 03:43.416
-Seven.
-Yikes.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.958
-And we'll need all of that.
-All right, we-- Whoa.

03:46.041 --> 03:49.500
Really? I mean, how much could
their information possibly cost?

03:49.583 --> 03:51.666
To find who's hunting Ciri? A lot.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.750
Really? And why do we need that?

03:55.125 --> 03:55.958
[gasps]

03:56.041 --> 03:57.625
[loud heartbeat]

03:58.833 --> 04:00.166
Whoa!

04:00.250 --> 04:03.875
Is that a giant metal spike
hidden in your secret door of mystery

04:03.958 --> 04:05.458
or are you just pleased to…

04:06.041 --> 04:08.041
-Not your best.
-Yeah, can't all be gold.

04:11.375 --> 04:12.208
Ah.

04:12.708 --> 04:15.166
How did I know that would be you?

04:15.250 --> 04:18.000
-Hello, Codringher.
-Hello, Geralt.

04:18.083 --> 04:21.500
Oh, goodness me,
the Viscount of Lettenhove.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.166
A rare pleasure.

04:23.875 --> 04:28.083
You know, I had that safety device
replaced just now.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.708
Next time, make an appointment, eh?

04:32.500 --> 04:33.375
Come in.

04:37.666 --> 04:40.208
-[officer shouts]
-[soldiers shout in reply]

04:40.875 --> 04:44.416
Good morrow, my lord. 'Tis ready for you.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
[soldiers continue shouting]

04:49.458 --> 04:50.500
[grunts] Hmm.

04:54.458 --> 04:57.166
Now, this will help get you
what you deserve.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.791
-You had them fix the balance?
-No shit. You told me to.

05:03.583 --> 05:04.833
My wife rather likes my head.

05:04.916 --> 05:07.291
-So I thought, best to follow orders.
-Huh.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.250
You know,
a sword like this won me an empire once.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.833
Hmm. I'd like to hear about it.

05:14.916 --> 05:16.916
-[metal clanking]
-[horses neighing]

05:17.666 --> 05:20.041
Late summer. 1260.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.166
[dramatic music]

05:23.041 --> 05:25.000
I was down to the last of my men.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.333
We hadn't eaten in days.

05:27.833 --> 05:32.875
Our swords were dull as spoons
from the bloody skirmishes. Aah…

05:34.583 --> 05:35.666
[sighs]

05:36.625 --> 05:39.583
It was my last chance
to take down the Usurper.

05:39.666 --> 05:40.791
[spits]

05:43.041 --> 05:44.166
I realized

05:44.875 --> 05:48.166
the only way
that I could reclaim my throne

05:49.166 --> 05:50.708
was to infiltrate the castle,

05:51.625 --> 05:56.208
kill everyone that stood between me
and the man that's stolen my life.

05:56.791 --> 05:57.833
A brave endeavor.

05:59.916 --> 06:01.541
-You mean a foolish one.
-[chuckles]

06:03.666 --> 06:04.875
[man] Emperor.

06:06.375 --> 06:10.166
I traded my boots to a dwarf
in return for a Mahakam steel sword.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.291
Aaah.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.833
It was that sword
that decapitated the bastard.

06:17.416 --> 06:18.250
[slaps table]

06:19.333 --> 06:20.333
One day,

06:21.250 --> 06:23.250
war will be a thing of the past.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.791
It will be a distant memory.

06:25.958 --> 06:28.250
I will have my queen by my side

06:28.333 --> 06:30.750
and the races of our world,
they will live in peace.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.875
And you will make me a new sword.

06:34.666 --> 06:36.291
One worthy of your craft.

06:37.958 --> 06:41.208
A sword befitting
the Emperor of the Continent.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.166
I'll drink to that.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.416
[man 1 wailing]

06:49.916 --> 06:52.250
-[man 2] What is it?
-[man 3 coughing]

06:52.750 --> 06:54.291
Fuck Kaer Morhen!

06:54.375 --> 06:55.375
Not poison.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.458
[man 3 vomiting and coughing]

06:59.208 --> 07:01.208
[chains jingling]

07:02.500 --> 07:04.041
[distant door slams]

07:05.250 --> 07:06.416
Everyone drink.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.333
Drink.

07:12.333 --> 07:13.333
I can't.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.625
You want the White Flame to be poisoned?

07:15.708 --> 07:17.333
[man 3 groaning and coughing]

07:25.333 --> 07:26.166
Drink.

07:29.625 --> 07:30.958
[yelps]

07:31.041 --> 07:32.250
[groans]

07:32.333 --> 07:34.333
[guard] I said, drink.

07:44.708 --> 07:46.208
It's not poison.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.500
Jaskier! This is a treat.

07:50.583 --> 07:54.541
Oh, I can assure you, madam,
the treat is entirely mine.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.500
Oh!

07:55.583 --> 07:59.333
I'd sign something for you, but it does
look like you have a shortage on paper.

07:59.416 --> 08:02.833
You once said that, like a witcher,

08:02.916 --> 08:07.291
you protect people from monsters
and monstrous difficulties.

08:07.958 --> 08:10.666
Since you already knew of my arrival,

08:10.750 --> 08:14.208
let's talk about my… difficulties.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.666
[Fenn clears throat]

08:17.750 --> 08:19.250
[horse neighing outside]

08:19.333 --> 08:25.041
That Rience, who interests you so much,
is quite a mysterious character.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.458
Mmm, we've heard of him, of course.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.125
The question is,

08:30.125 --> 08:31.250
why have you?

08:34.583 --> 08:36.208
He threatened to kill a friend of mine.

08:36.291 --> 08:38.375
-Not me. Don't worry.
-[cat yowls]

08:38.458 --> 08:42.708
Sorcerer's rejects
do often train as killers.

08:42.791 --> 08:46.708
And this Rience,
we know, was kicked out of Ban Ard.

08:46.791 --> 08:48.833
-That supports our theory.
-What theory?

08:48.916 --> 08:51.291
That he's working
for a sorcerer more powerful than him.

08:55.791 --> 08:56.791
Hmm.

08:57.416 --> 08:58.875
[playful music]

09:02.208 --> 09:03.583
-[coins jingle]
-[cat screeches]

09:04.166 --> 09:05.916
You alarmed my cat.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.458
[Geralt] I do apologize.

09:07.541 --> 09:10.750
I assumed the clink of coin
was the last thing that would startle it.

09:11.333 --> 09:15.041
I'm afraid that information
will cost you a bit more, Geralt.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.333
Let's try a wager.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.500
I shall turn my back,

09:25.791 --> 09:28.583
and you shall throw this at my head.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.083
Should you hit,

09:30.666 --> 09:31.541
you win.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.458
-[cat yowls]
-Should you miss,

09:33.541 --> 09:35.791
you will give me the information
that I want,

09:37.208 --> 09:38.541
on credit, of course.

09:39.625 --> 09:43.833
You're not seriously suggesting
that I accept this wager?

09:44.416 --> 09:45.666
[Geralt] No, I'm…

09:46.250 --> 09:47.333
sure you will.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.541
[sighs]

10:01.958 --> 10:03.250
You didn't even flinch.

10:05.041 --> 10:06.000
Why would I flinch?

10:06.666 --> 10:08.041
I heard you aiming to miss.

10:08.958 --> 10:10.458
[Fenn] Old softy.

10:10.541 --> 10:12.208
[dog barking outside]

10:16.416 --> 10:20.041
Some official sorcerers have secret pupils

10:20.125 --> 10:23.416
doing illegal or… dirty business.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.375
In sorcerer slang, it's described
as having someone on a leash.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.708
Whose leash?

10:27.791 --> 10:29.000
We don't know.

10:30.083 --> 10:35.041
But we do know where this sorcerer
is doing his dirty business.

10:35.125 --> 10:38.416
There is a castle called Vuilpanne,
uh, near the old scarlet--

10:38.500 --> 10:40.333
-Ammonite mines.
-Yeah.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.833
On the outskirts of Piana.

10:42.916 --> 10:45.916
If you know that,
you're already in too deep.

10:46.916 --> 10:49.958
This mage, whoever it is,

10:50.750 --> 10:52.333
is very dangerous.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.000
Let it lie, Geralt.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.458
I shall not. But you knew that already.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.333
Thank you for your time.

11:03.291 --> 11:06.416
Do give our best
to the Elder Blood princess.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.583
You have a client looking for her?

11:22.125 --> 11:23.000
Istredd.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.750
-The mage?
-[mouths]

11:26.833 --> 11:30.250
You must know
he isn't the only one willing to pay

11:30.333 --> 11:33.000
for the girl traveling
with the white-haired witcher.

11:33.583 --> 11:37.208
You want to save her?
You need to find another girl…

11:38.000 --> 11:39.875
An orphan of war, perhaps.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.416
-Ashen hair, green eyes--
-No.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.125
[Codringher] Geralt, my friend,

11:45.958 --> 11:49.250
a time of contempt is approaching.

11:49.916 --> 11:53.333
Deep and utter contempt.

11:54.666 --> 11:57.500
My proposition is a simple solution.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.750
Someone has to die

11:59.833 --> 12:01.625
so someone else

12:02.708 --> 12:03.541
can live.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.208
[sighs]

12:09.291 --> 12:12.833
I will not pay for what I love
by having contempt for myself.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.000
Let's go.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.416
Thank you.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.750
Rogue mages, power-hungry monarchs,
and now Istredd.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.708
Aren't you tired
of being on the run all the time?

12:31.375 --> 12:33.625
Maybe we could find
somewhere safe for her?

12:34.875 --> 12:37.750
Why don't we brainstorm solutions
on our way to Redania?

12:39.458 --> 12:40.291
Hey.

12:41.416 --> 12:43.375
I can hear you thinking.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.208
Don't start playing
the "I travel alone" card

12:46.291 --> 12:48.250
or "Jaskier, it's too dangerous" card.

12:48.333 --> 12:51.041
I would like to remind you
that I was just bait

12:51.125 --> 12:52.833
for Mr. Fire-Fingers.

12:52.916 --> 12:54.583
I appreciate it, Jask.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.583
I don't want to put you
in harm's way again.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.250
It's why I have to go to Vuilpanne.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.000
I'll come find you when Rience is dead.

13:05.916 --> 13:07.458
Or he'll find me once you are.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.041
[sighs]

13:16.083 --> 13:18.083
[foreboding music]

13:24.916 --> 13:26.500
[traders calling]

13:26.583 --> 13:29.750
-What are we shopping for, exactly?
-[Yennefer] A miracle. Keep up.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.541
-[bells ringing]
-[cows mooing]

13:34.166 --> 13:36.125
What was that letter you sent earlier?

13:36.833 --> 13:39.916
It's for Tissaia.
Telling her I'm coming home.

13:40.916 --> 13:42.958
Is there a chance she might say no?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.333
It's complicated. [sniffs]

13:47.750 --> 13:49.166
Because of me?

13:50.041 --> 13:52.083
Yes, you do tend to complicate things.

13:54.916 --> 13:57.333
Yes, well, I'm not the only one.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.458
You may be watching me,

14:01.958 --> 14:03.208
but I have eyes too.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.541
And what do you see, my ugly one?

14:07.791 --> 14:09.875
Most times,
a picture of powerful perfection.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.750
Excellent. [laughs]

14:13.833 --> 14:16.083
But you wrote three drafts of that letter.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.166
So there's more to the picture,
isn't there?

14:22.166 --> 14:23.791
[Yennefer] We need to keep moving.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.750
Here. Run this
through that tangled mop on your head.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.958
-[guard] Password.
-[Yennefer] Ragamuffin.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.916
[Yennefer] Training hasn't helped
control your power as I'd hoped.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.458
If anything, it's brought it
to the surface, made it more present.

14:41.125 --> 14:41.958
[Ciri] Great.

14:42.958 --> 14:45.250
At Aretuza,
you can learn to focus your visions

14:45.333 --> 14:47.333
on the future you actually want to see.

14:47.416 --> 14:49.708
-[man 1] Over here!
-What if I don't want to see anything?

14:50.208 --> 14:52.000
Well, then you're blind
to the big picture.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.291
[man 2] Put it down there!

14:53.791 --> 14:55.583
Here she is. Come along!

14:56.666 --> 14:58.500
-[traders shouting]
-[goats bleating]

14:59.166 --> 15:02.041
Yen! Thank the gods, you're alive.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.041
[kissing]

15:03.125 --> 15:06.208
-Tell me you've got good gossip.
-No time, Keira. I need your help.

15:06.291 --> 15:09.375
My handmaiden and I are in need
of one of your portals.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.166
To Aretuza.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.208
You're going back to Aretuza?

15:13.291 --> 15:16.041
After that legendary night
of non-fatal execution?

15:16.125 --> 15:19.791
Well, I'm hoping they've forgotten
about that. Or forgiven me, anyway.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.708
Mmph! Good luck.
Tissaia still hasn't forgiven me.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.625
You fuck one upstart prince
with designs on the throne…

15:26.208 --> 15:27.833
Anyway, it's good to see you.

15:27.916 --> 15:29.958
Business has been achingly slow.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.458
People are decapitated
if they stray their kingdoms.

15:32.541 --> 15:33.375
By whom?

15:33.458 --> 15:35.125
-Each other.
-[Keira scoffs]

15:35.208 --> 15:36.375
With Nilfgaard on the horizon,

15:36.458 --> 15:39.041
you'd think the North
would have got their shit together by now.

15:39.541 --> 15:42.458
-Is there nothing the Brotherhood can do?
-[man] Oi, hurry up.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.666
-Go on.
-[whimpers]

15:50.250 --> 15:51.625
I need a portal to Claremont.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.541
This one's got somethin' waitin' for them.

15:57.625 --> 15:58.791
[man scoffs]

15:59.291 --> 16:00.166
Now.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.208
[sniffing]

16:07.000 --> 16:08.375
[groans]

16:08.458 --> 16:09.708
-[sighs]
-[clicking]

16:10.291 --> 16:11.416
[chuckles]

16:12.416 --> 16:13.708
Fancy a sniff, love?

16:14.791 --> 16:15.750
I don't partake.

16:19.875 --> 16:20.916
[gasps]

16:21.416 --> 16:23.458
-[crowd screeching]
-[woman] Kill the bitch!

16:24.625 --> 16:25.541
[screaming]

16:26.166 --> 16:27.416
Ciri! [yelps]

16:31.708 --> 16:33.041
[speaking in Elder]

16:33.916 --> 16:36.000
[man] Hold it open. I won't be long.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.041
Run! Run!

16:37.833 --> 16:39.708
[man] Hey! What the fuck?

16:40.916 --> 16:41.958
[thump]

16:42.041 --> 16:44.375
You have no idea who you've just crossed--

16:44.458 --> 16:46.458
-[low rumbling]
-[gurgles]

16:50.125 --> 16:51.875
[man spluttering]

16:51.958 --> 16:53.458
[creaking]

16:54.833 --> 16:55.875
[crack]

16:57.416 --> 16:58.458
[Keira] What have you done?

16:59.333 --> 17:02.041
That was one of Houvenaghel's men.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.875
If you don't want to end up decapitated,
I suggest you run too.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.750
-Keira, wait--
-[whoosh]

17:07.375 --> 17:08.958
[voices approaching]

17:10.083 --> 17:11.041
Go.

17:13.583 --> 17:16.000
Magic is organizing Chaos.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.166
This requires two things.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.208
Balance and control.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.500
Without them, Chaos will kill you.

17:25.958 --> 17:27.416
Has anyone seen Nissa?

17:31.375 --> 17:33.083
Elizabet, fetch Nissa from her room,

17:33.166 --> 17:36.791
and remind her that sickness of any sort,
including homesickness,

17:36.875 --> 17:38.416
will not be tolerated.

17:39.875 --> 17:43.958
[Vilgefortz] Go back and try again,
Sabrina. We cannot let this stand.

17:44.666 --> 17:47.625
I'm telling you, he's immovable.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.541
He says Foltest and his people can starve
for all he cares.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.500
[Stregobor] Even if Henselt wanted
to send the grain to Temeria,

17:53.583 --> 17:56.083
the damn Scoia'tael
would just steal it on the way.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.916
We're wondering why
the kings are losing faith in us.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.791
Because we knew the elves were a problem
and we did nothing about it.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.708
That's… a short-sighted view of history.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.166
But I expect nothing less from you.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.666
[Artorius] Enough coddling.

18:10.416 --> 18:13.791
Return Triss to Foltest's court
and let's get this rough patch smoothed.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.583
That would be as useful
as putting bandage on a severed limb.

18:17.666 --> 18:21.166
Tissaia promised them
Cirilla of Cintra's head on a platter

18:21.250 --> 18:22.458
and she failed to deliver.

18:22.541 --> 18:25.666
We want peace,
let's find the brat and kill her.

18:25.750 --> 18:26.666
No!

18:26.750 --> 18:30.041
Last I checked, slinging matches are not
how we conduct business here.

18:30.583 --> 18:34.500
We will take all concerns to the full body
of the Council, as we always have.

18:35.291 --> 18:37.625
In the meantime,
you are disrupting lessons.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.666
[sighs]

18:49.791 --> 18:50.958
[Tissaia] They're not wrong.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.416
Loath as I am to admit it…

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
-If you return to court--
-I told you.

18:55.583 --> 18:58.833
The Brotherhood is welcome
to fill my position at Temeria any time.

18:58.916 --> 19:02.750
I am best placed here with you, helping
these girls learn what they're capable of.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.750
It is a noble calling.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.333
But I can't help but wonder
if it's really about them.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.791
[whispers] Just because
you couldn't help Ciri…

19:15.416 --> 19:17.000
I will go and check on Nissa.

19:20.416 --> 19:21.833
[door opens]

19:22.416 --> 19:23.875
[footsteps fading]

19:26.458 --> 19:28.458
[pensive music]

19:33.375 --> 19:34.375
Nissa?

19:34.458 --> 19:36.416
[girls laughing and chatting]

20:13.125 --> 20:14.958
-[whip blow lands]
-[Dijkstra groans]

20:15.583 --> 20:17.333
[Philippa] Tell me about the elf.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.500
[Dijkstra] Count de Noailles
had captured an elf.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.666
He said she was an assassin. [whimpers]

20:23.166 --> 20:24.791
-[blow lands]
-[Philippa] Louder!

20:26.125 --> 20:27.375
[splutters]

20:28.500 --> 20:29.500
[Philippa] Speak!

20:30.833 --> 20:34.666
He… made me cut her…

20:36.166 --> 20:37.875
in a thousand different ways.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.333
And…

20:42.333 --> 20:43.666
[Philippa] What did you do?

20:44.791 --> 20:48.000
I… cut too deep.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.875
And that was my first kill.

20:57.041 --> 20:58.916
[yelps]

21:02.166 --> 21:03.666
Please, no…

21:03.750 --> 21:05.666
Did that excite you?

21:07.791 --> 21:08.708
[mouths]

21:09.833 --> 21:10.833
No.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.625
It made me angry.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.708
It was a waste.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.458
We could have turned that elf.

21:20.250 --> 21:22.083
Made her do our bidding.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.166
She could have… been useful.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.750
Yes. Useful.

21:34.041 --> 21:35.041
Good boy.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.291
[groans]

21:41.083 --> 21:42.666
[breathing heavily]

21:47.166 --> 21:50.125
You, uh… you went
quite a bit harder that time.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.666
Not too hard?

21:55.416 --> 21:58.333
You always give me perspective. Clarity.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.375
[groans] Thank you.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.875
I need you to do something in return.

22:06.916 --> 22:09.833
Radovid has surprisingly good instincts.

22:10.666 --> 22:12.666
Perhaps he could help
keep Vizimir in line.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.208
I don't need help.
I've been managing him for years.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.916
I've never seen
this Continent more divided.

22:19.125 --> 22:22.875
Nilfgaard's not the only ones
who know it's ripe for the taking.

22:22.958 --> 22:25.208
And if Radovid could be useful to us…

22:25.291 --> 22:26.958
To Redania.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.583
Speak to him. Hmm?

22:37.333 --> 22:38.375
[whispers] For me.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.458
[sighs]

22:41.750 --> 22:42.750
Hmm.

22:44.750 --> 22:45.875
We're done.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.416
[conversation and laughter]

22:56.916 --> 22:57.833
Ahem.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.583
[silence falls]

23:01.583 --> 23:03.500
[man whispers] It's him. Jaskier.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.958
[woman] It's the Dandelion.

23:05.666 --> 23:08.083
-[man] Can't believe it!
-My man said I had a visitor.

23:08.958 --> 23:11.250
But this, I must say, is a nice surprise.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.500
-Mmm.
-Have you come to sing us a pretty song?

23:13.583 --> 23:17.166
Ha, ha! Uh, no. No, I don't, uh…
I don't do pretty.

23:18.375 --> 23:19.333
I have information.

23:21.083 --> 23:25.333
Those two detectives,
Codringher and Fenn, you've heard of them?

23:25.416 --> 23:26.375
No.

23:27.666 --> 23:28.750
Regardless,

23:29.750 --> 23:31.625
they know who Rience is working for.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.541
-Trivia.
-Mm-hmm.

23:33.625 --> 23:34.583
Oh, tell me.

23:34.666 --> 23:38.333
Geralt is determined to solve it
in his Geralt way,

23:38.416 --> 23:42.500
because he didn't have enough money
to pry their lips apart, but…

23:44.041 --> 23:45.875
you do, I assume.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.500
I appreciate the information,

23:49.583 --> 23:52.083
I do, but what I really want is a song.

23:52.166 --> 23:53.000
Uh… [laughs]

23:53.083 --> 23:56.125
No. No, I'm, uh…
not really in a singing mood.

23:56.208 --> 23:57.583
-Oh, go on.
-No. Uh…

23:57.666 --> 24:00.833
Your clientele look like they're having
a very lovely time without me--

24:00.916 --> 24:03.083
Pick your favorite. Please.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.916
They'd love a song
about your white-haired witcher.

24:07.833 --> 24:08.791
All right.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.291
[man whispers] I'm so excited!

24:18.666 --> 24:20.291
[crow cawing]

24:20.375 --> 24:22.125
[ominous music]

24:26.500 --> 24:27.708
[Roach snorts]

24:29.541 --> 24:32.041
-It's probably a trap.
-[neighs]

24:39.291 --> 24:40.500
Mm-hmm.

24:46.875 --> 24:48.000
[sighs]

24:50.291 --> 24:52.291
[bats squeaking]

25:02.875 --> 25:04.541
[water dripping]

25:06.166 --> 25:07.333
[sighs]

25:33.333 --> 25:34.750
[croaking]

25:45.791 --> 25:47.833
[deep rumbling]

25:52.833 --> 25:54.541
[whispering voices]

25:57.166 --> 25:58.583
Definitely a trap.

26:05.583 --> 26:07.250
[Ciri] May as well talk about it.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.333
I know you're angry.

26:10.916 --> 26:13.791
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.916
I did say we needed
to avoid unwanted attention.

26:20.000 --> 26:20.958
I know.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.208
[Yennefer] This one's on me.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.083
In all those lessons,
I should have taught you

26:26.166 --> 26:28.791
that sometimes,
discretion is more important than valor.

26:30.583 --> 26:31.708
You sound like Geralt.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.416
Well, he isn't always wrong.

26:35.041 --> 26:38.500
One day, I may be queen,
and I'll need to use what I've got.

26:38.583 --> 26:43.208
And what I've got is a sense of justice,
a dagger and quick reflexes.

26:43.916 --> 26:47.458
-You and Geralt taught me those things.
-Then our teachings were incomplete.

26:47.541 --> 26:49.583
We should have taught you
about consequences.

26:49.666 --> 26:52.208
Consequences are just
an excuse not to act.

26:52.291 --> 26:54.416
Even when someone's going to be killed.

26:54.958 --> 26:56.625
You didn't see that child's eyes.

26:56.708 --> 26:59.833
-I had to do what I did--
-No, you chose to interfere.

27:02.125 --> 27:05.166
That messenger in Ellander,
his fate is a mystery.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.916
But I know what will happen here.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.208
Dominik Houvenaghel will send
his cousin Leo Bonhart here

27:11.291 --> 27:13.958
to recuperate his losses
with money or with blood.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.416
The townspeople who do survive
will be conscripted to fight

27:17.500 --> 27:19.416
against the war
that's looming on the horizon,

27:19.500 --> 27:21.708
where they'll die on the battlefield.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.708
If disease or starvation
doesn't claim them first.

27:25.666 --> 27:26.750
You saved one,

27:27.375 --> 27:30.291
and the consequence has likely
damned a hundred others in exchange.

27:30.375 --> 27:33.666
What is the point in me seeing the future
if I can't do anything to change it?

27:40.416 --> 27:44.083
Well, why would you understand?
You see what you want, you make it happen.

27:44.666 --> 27:46.791
You snap your fingers, mountains move.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.833
Men bend to your will.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.291
How would you know what it's like
to fight for control of your life?

28:02.875 --> 28:04.083
Where are you going?

28:04.750 --> 28:05.625
More shopping?

28:05.708 --> 28:08.125
No, my ugly one.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.541
We're taking a detour.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.125
Why do you call me that?

28:12.708 --> 28:15.958
Because I promised
I'd be sincere with you from here forward.

28:17.583 --> 28:18.458
Come along.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.208
I want to show you who I really am.

28:24.916 --> 28:26.500
[yelling and screaming]

28:34.083 --> 28:35.291
[Cahir gasping]

28:36.208 --> 28:38.208
[soldier] Where's my fucking sword?

28:40.916 --> 28:42.000
[sword rings]

28:42.083 --> 28:43.541
You're not even a fuckin' elf.

28:43.625 --> 28:44.875
[gasping]

28:44.958 --> 28:46.583
[soldier] But you'll die like one.

28:56.041 --> 28:59.125
[soldier's voice] You'll pay for this,
Nilfgaardian scum.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.208
-[blow lands]
-[spluttering]

29:06.125 --> 29:07.250
Get up.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.625
Get up, old friend.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.041
Thanks for the save.

29:15.125 --> 29:17.083
You've gotten my back
more than a few times.

29:17.166 --> 29:18.916
It's my duty to pay back the favor.

29:20.333 --> 29:23.000
-[sighs]
-What the hell are you doing here?

29:23.500 --> 29:25.625
[sighs]

29:27.958 --> 29:30.333
[Gallatin grunts]
Francesca spouts her nonsense

29:30.416 --> 29:32.916
about prophecies, Hen Ichaer,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.750
while the Scoia'tael die
pillaging supplies.

29:35.833 --> 29:39.375
[grunts] All so we don't die
from hunger and frost.

29:39.458 --> 29:42.041
I thought all you pointies
were superstitious.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.333
-[scoffs]
-Don't believe the legend of Elder Blood?

29:44.416 --> 29:45.458
Please.

29:45.541 --> 29:47.500
My people were building civilizations

29:47.583 --> 29:51.375
while you blunt-eared bastards still
thought thunder was the gods passing wind.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.291
-[Cahir chuckles]
-I believe in facts.

29:54.166 --> 29:57.958
The fact is, Francesca's Hen Ichaer
is a girl from Cintra.

29:59.958 --> 30:00.916
Cintra?

30:01.416 --> 30:03.000
I saw her with my own eyes.

30:03.083 --> 30:05.833
Apparently, the princess
is the savior of elvenkind.

30:07.291 --> 30:08.958
I can't do it anymore, Cahir.

30:09.458 --> 30:13.375
I can't keep leading my men to die
for a cause I don't believe in.

30:13.458 --> 30:14.708
[both grunt]

30:14.791 --> 30:17.625
Ah. That's why you came back.

30:18.458 --> 30:22.041
You've considered my proposal
to take charge of the elves.

30:22.125 --> 30:24.041
-[Gallatin] Aye.
-[both grunt]

30:24.125 --> 30:28.208
But… there's one thing
I still don't understand.

30:29.416 --> 30:32.416
You. You were Emhyr's top general.

30:33.083 --> 30:36.208
Now he's sent you to raid caravans
on the arse end of the battle lines

30:36.291 --> 30:39.875
while getting the high holy shit
kicked out of you every day.

30:39.958 --> 30:41.250
-[scoffs]
-I don't get it.

30:41.333 --> 30:43.333
If he's a wise man, as you say,

30:43.833 --> 30:46.541
why the hell's he wasting
gods-given talent like yours?

30:50.791 --> 30:52.166
I betrayed him.

30:53.083 --> 30:54.250
Lied to him.

30:55.458 --> 30:58.791
He trusted me to fulfill
his most sacred mission, and I failed.

30:59.791 --> 31:03.833
So your plan is to keep paying penance
until you're killed by Northern troops?

31:04.375 --> 31:07.458
He must be quite a man
to inspire such cock-eyed loyalty.

31:07.541 --> 31:10.583
Oh, friend,
your men hold you in the same regard,

31:10.666 --> 31:13.500
even if you are
an old, ugly, arrogant prick.

31:14.208 --> 31:15.208
Bold.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.708
Well, if I agree to your proposal,

31:19.625 --> 31:22.500
what does overthrowing Francesca
say about my loyalty?

31:22.583 --> 31:23.458
Gallatin,

31:25.250 --> 31:28.791
you are one of the finest soldiers
I've ever fought beside.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.125
The White Flame will see it.

31:32.208 --> 31:34.750
You will help him take the North,
not Francesca.

31:36.666 --> 31:38.125
He earned my loyalty.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.916
Has she earned yours?

31:44.625 --> 31:45.791
[mice squeaking]

31:45.875 --> 31:47.625
You wanna hear a good joke?

31:47.708 --> 31:48.708
Hmm.

31:49.750 --> 31:50.791
I was born

31:51.375 --> 31:54.416
with more power
than most could comprehend.

31:55.625 --> 31:58.791
Learned to bend Chaos to my will.

31:59.375 --> 32:02.208
Designed to live forever young

32:03.416 --> 32:04.500
and beautiful

32:05.333 --> 32:08.291
in the upper echelons of the court.

32:10.208 --> 32:11.750
Only to die here

32:13.250 --> 32:14.875
in a wine cellar

32:15.500 --> 32:17.083
with all of you. [sighs]

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
-You know the problem with you mages?
-What?

32:21.583 --> 32:23.500
You're too bloody serious.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.333
[laughs]

32:27.416 --> 32:28.875
-Yeah.
-'S true.

32:28.958 --> 32:30.250
Yeah!

32:33.708 --> 32:36.750
Yeah, helping the Brotherhood
keep their power

32:36.833 --> 32:41.041
by proppin' up rotten kingdoms
is serious work.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.708
Won't be the case
when Nilfgaard takes over.

32:43.791 --> 32:47.166
-Why?
-Emhyr has no use for the mages.

32:48.416 --> 32:49.416
Case in point.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.541
If I ever get out of here,

32:53.875 --> 32:55.625
I'll play that game much smarter.

32:56.958 --> 32:58.958
I saw a man try to escape once.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.083
They sent the dogs after him.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.833
Tore him limb from limb.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.208
The Emperor only absolves you

33:10.708 --> 33:13.375
once you're dead, love.

Ah.

Hey!

33:31.750 --> 33:33.500
We got another one.

33:35.166 --> 33:36.125
[man coughs] He's--

33:38.291 --> 33:41.291

41:44.833 --> 41:46.541
-[flies buzzing]
-[cart wheels rumbling]

41:46.625 --> 41:48.000
[horse neighing]

41:59.791 --> 42:01.041
Cor!

42:02.500 --> 42:03.958
[dramatic music]

42:14.791 --> 42:15.958
[grunts]

42:28.166 --> 42:29.541
[sighs]

42:29.625 --> 42:32.041
They all thought the baker
was an innocent bystander,

42:32.125 --> 42:34.250
but I told them,
he was the contortionist's aim

42:34.333 --> 42:35.875
right from the beginning! [chortling]

42:35.958 --> 42:37.583
[courtiers laugh loudly]

42:37.666 --> 42:38.833
[lively music]

42:38.916 --> 42:41.916
Uh… but speaking of things
that go bump in the night,

42:42.000 --> 42:46.041
did I ever tell you about the time I saw
a young elf leaving Virfuril's bedchamber?

42:46.125 --> 42:49.208
-Darling, Virfuril is a frivolous fool.
-Hmm.

42:49.291 --> 42:53.166
-What would I do without you, darling?
-Well, clearly not much, darling.

42:53.250 --> 42:55.208
-Eva, more meat.
-Yes, m'lady.

42:55.791 --> 42:58.500
He said that he was there
for an interrogation.

42:58.583 --> 43:01.458
Well, torture would explain
the sounds I heard.

43:01.541 --> 43:03.000
[laughter]

43:05.708 --> 43:08.166
I just had the most intriguing visit
from the witcher's friend.

43:08.833 --> 43:11.041
He seems to think those old farts
Codringher and Fenn

43:11.125 --> 43:12.791
might have some info about Rience.

43:12.875 --> 43:13.750
And?

43:14.250 --> 43:17.583
And I'm wondering if perhaps
our methods of obtaining the girl

43:17.666 --> 43:19.958
would be more easily achieved
with a carrot than a stick.

43:20.041 --> 43:21.791
How very interesting.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.416
Perhaps I need
to pay those old farts a visit too, hmm?

43:25.500 --> 43:27.958
-[Vizimir] Passing me, same passage!
-[laughter]

43:28.041 --> 43:30.625
Picture the elf,
standing in the snow, belt unbuckled,

43:30.708 --> 43:32.916
a delicious look of guilt across his face.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.541
Now, being the fair-minded king that I am,
I said, "I'll give you a head start,

43:36.625 --> 43:38.291
but you are due an arrow in the bum."

43:38.375 --> 43:40.041
Now, I yell "Go,"

43:40.125 --> 43:42.125
he scuttles off like a wounded deer,

43:42.208 --> 43:44.041
and then I shot the elf, like this.

43:44.125 --> 43:45.166
Hold still, I say.

43:45.958 --> 43:48.041
-[courtiers cheer and applaud]
-[Vizimir] Yeah!

43:48.791 --> 43:50.666
Aplegatt! You lucky bastard!

43:50.750 --> 43:52.833
-Ah.
-[Vizimir] What word do you bring?

43:53.375 --> 43:56.666
Now, have I ever told you
about the first time…

43:57.416 --> 44:00.416
You don't seem to be enjoying
my brother's epic tales of derring-do.

44:00.500 --> 44:03.458
-[Vizimir] Aplegatt was…
-Hmm. I've heard this tale before.

44:03.541 --> 44:06.291
-It doesn't improve by repetition.
-[Vizimir] But that's another story!

44:06.375 --> 44:08.541
Alas, my brother's not renowned
for his wit.

44:09.583 --> 44:12.875
Philippa seems to think that you might
have more wit than meets the eye.

44:13.708 --> 44:15.625
[Vizimir] …when, through the branches,
I see…

44:15.708 --> 44:17.958
-Or not.
-[Vizimir] …dark-furred…

44:18.666 --> 44:20.041
Surely, as Redania's spymaster,

44:20.125 --> 44:23.166
you must realize that everyone
in this room's hiding something.

44:24.125 --> 44:27.083
Even those like my brother,
who seem to be witless.

44:27.166 --> 44:29.208
Vizimir has no secrets from me.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.541
Then you do know
about his meeting last night?

44:33.416 --> 44:35.083
With Nilfgaard.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.291
[cat yowls]

44:47.125 --> 44:48.500
Did you hear something?

44:48.583 --> 44:49.916
-No.
-Really?

44:50.791 --> 44:51.666
-Nothing.
-[cat growls]

44:51.750 --> 44:55.166
Why am I even asking? You're going deaf.

44:55.250 --> 44:56.166
I'll have you--

44:58.250 --> 45:00.916
-Heard you had a visitor.
-We have lots of-- [cries out]

45:01.000 --> 45:02.625
-[groans]
-[Rience] You know who I mean.

45:02.708 --> 45:03.750
The witcher was here.

45:03.833 --> 45:06.125
I can still smell his stench.
What did you tell him?

45:07.250 --> 45:11.000
Don't worry. We didn't mention
anything about your employer.

45:11.083 --> 45:15.291
Or what he's really got planned
for Cirilla of Cintra.

45:16.125 --> 45:18.166
What do you know about his plans?

45:24.416 --> 45:25.458
Huh.

45:29.708 --> 45:30.833
[meowing]

45:31.541 --> 45:32.583
[hissing]

45:32.666 --> 45:34.041
[Fenn] Please. Not the cat!

45:34.125 --> 45:35.416
Tell me everything.

45:37.708 --> 45:39.916
[echoing screams]

45:40.958 --> 45:42.958
[dramatic music]

45:53.000 --> 45:56.250
-[thunder rolling]
-[heavy rainfall]

46:01.458 --> 46:04.791
So… are you going to let
Yennefer come home?

46:04.875 --> 46:07.833
[sighs] Let her? She's already on her way.

46:09.833 --> 46:11.208
[Vilgefortz] Of course she is.

46:13.250 --> 46:15.000
With an agenda, no doubt.

46:16.916 --> 46:18.208
-[Tissaia sighs]
-Hmm?

46:18.708 --> 46:20.083
[chuckles]

46:20.166 --> 46:23.708
Oh, she's as fair-weathered
as the fog over this island.

46:26.541 --> 46:27.958
Triss is right.

46:29.666 --> 46:31.291
Gods forbid, Stregobor too.

46:32.208 --> 46:35.000
We need to get the Northern kings
to listen to us and work together.

46:35.083 --> 46:36.375
The last thing they'd want to see

46:36.458 --> 46:39.083
is the woman
who set their execution party ablaze.

46:41.333 --> 46:42.708
[sighs shakily]

46:43.458 --> 46:44.458
But you love her.

46:48.708 --> 46:50.875
I think your mind
is struggling to catch up

46:51.458 --> 46:53.666
with the decision
your heart's already made.

46:53.750 --> 46:55.208
[wistful music]

46:55.291 --> 46:57.000
You head the Council with me.

46:57.833 --> 46:59.125
How do you feel?

47:00.791 --> 47:03.208
-Gods know you weren't fond of her.
-[chuckles]

47:04.250 --> 47:06.666
That's only because
we have too much in common.

47:08.291 --> 47:09.958
-Bad tempers.
-Hmm.

47:10.916 --> 47:12.208
Impetuousness.

47:13.291 --> 47:15.416
The overwhelming need to win an argument.

47:15.500 --> 47:16.791
[laughs]

47:21.041 --> 47:22.958
And we have one other thing in common.

47:26.166 --> 47:27.166
Our love

47:28.875 --> 47:29.875
for you.

47:45.250 --> 47:47.125
If Yennefer can let go of the past,

47:48.333 --> 47:49.333
so can I.

47:53.291 --> 47:55.041
[gentle ringing]

47:56.375 --> 47:58.958
-What's this?
-An old superstition.

48:00.125 --> 48:02.500
The stones are rumored
to have protective abilities.

48:05.291 --> 48:07.375
You could just tell me
you were thinking of me.

48:07.458 --> 48:08.583
[Vilgefortz chuckles]

48:11.375 --> 48:13.125
[wistful music builds]

48:13.208 --> 48:15.208
[gentle ringing continues]

48:16.166 --> 48:17.833
[thunder rumbling]

48:19.458 --> 48:21.166
I'll meet Yennefer at Gors Velen.

48:21.833 --> 48:23.708
Make sure she's not bringing trouble.

48:27.750 --> 48:29.250
[crows cawing]

48:38.250 --> 48:40.000
[poignant music]

48:50.500 --> 48:52.458
Our detour was to a field.

48:54.375 --> 48:56.166
A house used to stand here.

48:58.166 --> 48:59.291
My house.

49:02.333 --> 49:03.833
This is where I grew up.

49:14.416 --> 49:16.041
[Yennefer's father]
Get out of there, girl!

49:16.125 --> 49:17.708
[Yennefer] I can do it! [grunts]

49:17.791 --> 49:19.041
[Tissaia] How much for a pig?

49:19.125 --> 49:20.291
How much for this beast?

49:20.375 --> 49:21.666
[mother] She's our daughter!

49:21.750 --> 49:23.250
[father] She's no daughter of mine.

49:23.333 --> 49:24.666
[Yennefer] You can't take me!

49:24.750 --> 49:26.291
-[screams]
-I won't go.

49:26.375 --> 49:29.416
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

49:29.500 --> 49:30.833
[screaming]

49:30.916 --> 49:33.875
You do not have a choice.

49:39.416 --> 49:43.333
-[gasps]
-My whole life I've had so much power.

49:45.625 --> 49:47.375
But I've never been perfect.

49:47.875 --> 49:50.250
I fought with Tissaia
every step of the way.

49:51.541 --> 49:53.375
I wanted to do things my way.

49:54.916 --> 49:55.916
That letter?

49:57.291 --> 50:00.083
I don't know
if I'll be welcomed back to Aretuza.

50:01.125 --> 50:03.083
Like you, I once chose to interfere.

50:04.666 --> 50:06.125
I set a prisoner free.

50:07.666 --> 50:10.958
And in doing so, I set the entire North
against the Brotherhood.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.958
And the Brotherhood against each other.

50:16.708 --> 50:19.083
Those bodies hanging at the tavern.

50:21.666 --> 50:23.041
All those executions.

50:23.125 --> 50:25.750
The whole Continent
is paying the consequences.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
And you.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.166
Because of me.

50:33.458 --> 50:35.416
It's not enough to possess Chaos.

50:35.916 --> 50:36.833
You and I,

50:38.125 --> 50:39.791
we must learn to control it.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.750
That is the essence of power.

50:43.291 --> 50:45.750
That is how we will move mountains.

50:47.916 --> 50:48.833
Together.

50:51.916 --> 50:52.916
Come along,

50:54.666 --> 50:55.791
Ciri.

51:09.833 --> 51:11.875
[echoing howling]

51:24.333 --> 51:26.333
[wind whistling]

51:26.416 --> 51:28.041
[crows cawing]

51:32.583 --> 51:33.541
Hmm.

51:34.833 --> 51:36.208
-Hello?
-[gasps]

51:37.000 --> 51:39.541
You're out of that place now. You're safe.

51:48.083 --> 51:49.166
Are you all right?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.916
I knew you'd come for me.

51:57.500 --> 51:59.125
And how'd you know that?

52:00.250 --> 52:01.750
Because you always do.

52:04.916 --> 52:06.708
We're tied by destiny.

52:10.583 --> 52:11.666
Who are you?

52:13.083 --> 52:14.250
Don't be silly, Geralt.

52:15.166 --> 52:16.375
You know who I am.

52:18.166 --> 52:19.375
I'm Ciri.

52:19.458 --> 52:20.958
[dramatic music]
