Let all the dreamers wake the nation

01:17.911 --> 01:26.002
Come the New Jerusalem

01:28.505 --> 01:32.508
Silver cities rise

01:32.593 --> 01:35.344
The morning lights

01:35.429 --> 01:38.765
The streets
that lead them

01:38.849 --> 01:40.850
And sirens

01:40.934 --> 01:43.019
Call them on

01:43.103 --> 01:47.356
With a song

01:49.443 --> 01:54.864
It's asking
for the taking

01:54.948 --> 02:00.203
Trembling, shaking

02:00.287 --> 02:05.041
Oh, my heart is aching

02:05.125 --> 02:06.709
We're coming to the edge

02:06.794 --> 02:08.211
Running on the water

02:08.294 --> 02:11.047
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

02:11.131 --> 02:15.218
We, the great and small

02:15.302 --> 02:17.887
Stand on a star

02:17.971 --> 02:23.559
And blaze a trail
of desire...

02:23.644 --> 02:29.065
...Tess,
happy birthday to you

02:32.486 --> 02:34.403
Did you make a wish?

02:34.905 --> 02:37.073
Yeah.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.574
Come run with me now

02:38.659 --> 02:40.952
The sky is the color
of blue

02:41.036 --> 02:43.204
You've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover

02:43.288 --> 02:47.583
Oh, my heart is aching

02:47.668 --> 02:49.085
We're coming to the edge

02:49.169 --> 02:50.920
Running on the water

Coming through the fog,

02:53.841 --> 02:56.050
Let the river run

02:57.678 --> 03:01.347
Let all the dreamers
wake...

03:01.431 --> 03:03.683
No lunch.
I got speech class.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.268
What do you need
speech class for?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.769
You talk fine.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.731
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
We'll ride back together.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.818
I can't. I've got emerging market
seminar at 5:30.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.862
It's your birthday.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.614
Can't they emerge without you
just this once?

03:19.283 --> 03:20.992
What time is
my surprise party?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.159
What?

03:22.244 --> 03:23.578
Come on.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.372
I'm supposed to
have you home at 7:00.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.417
I'll cut out early
and be home at 7:15.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.543
All right.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.003
Thank you very much.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.303
Let the river run

03:40.387 --> 03:46.642

Hi, Tess.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.481
Morning.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.152
Jerusalem

03:56.236 --> 03:57.653
Morning, Tess.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.988
Morning.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.197
Hello, Tess.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.449
Hi.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.658
I've got
a little secret

04:02.743 --> 04:04.285
I want to tell you.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.162
[Telephone Rings]

04:07.956 --> 04:09.165
[ring]

04:11.585 --> 04:13.502
Mr. Turkel's line.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.672
Um... Who's calling, please?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.635
Um... Hold on a moment.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.386
Mr. Lutz.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.892
Um... Hold on
a second, all right?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.478
I wouldn't
do that to you,

04:30.562 --> 04:32.813
so relax and tell me
how many you want.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.900
[Knocking]

04:35.984 --> 04:37.360
Mr. Turkel?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.362
Mr. Turkel!

04:39.446 --> 04:40.488
Huh?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.198
Um... Mr. Alagesh...

04:43.700 --> 04:44.742
Hi.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.286
Mr. Alagesh is real
anxious to talk to you.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.330
Couldn't you
get him to hold?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.748
You got him
in Denatech,

04:50.832 --> 04:52.208
the one I said
go short on,

04:52.292 --> 04:54.710
and it's fine, but he don't want
to hear it from a secretary.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.964
- There's no paper.
- What?

04:58.048 --> 05:01.842
There is no goddamn paper.
Get me some.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.268
Thanks.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.895
You're very kind.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.441
Oh!

05:21.071 --> 05:23.155
He's short
on Denatech at 18,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.241
and he'll be
right here.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.009
You see
Denatech closing?

05:43.093 --> 05:46.303
171/8. Come Monday,
I bet it's 16.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.847
How you figure?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.766
They went public at 23
with one product...

05:50.851 --> 05:52.435
plaque-removing
mouthwash.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.062
You get this glob
of plaque

05:55.147 --> 05:56.355
you got to spit out.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.191
No one ever got rich

05:59.276 --> 06:02.445
overestimating what
people want to taste.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.822
Maybe.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.491
Before I run, Tess,

06:07.576 --> 06:10.619
I have good news
and bad news.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.705
The straight shot,
Tessie, is,

06:12.789 --> 06:16.000
they turned you down
for the entree program again.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.461
Why?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.795
Did all we could,
Tessie.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.089
You're up against
Harvard graduates.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.632
What do you got?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.134
Some night school,

06:25.218 --> 06:26.886
some secretarial time
on your sheet?

06:26.970 --> 06:29.138
Christians
and lions, Tess.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.640
The good news?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.142
Dave has a friend.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.478
Bob in Arbitrage.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.938
They're looking for
hungry down there.

06:38.774 --> 06:39.815
Really?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.817
Hungry's the name of
the game down there.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.112
Bob's looking for a new assistant.
He wants to meet you for a drink.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.490
This isn't
another setup?

06:48.158 --> 06:49.200
Sh...

06:49.993 --> 06:51.535
Do I look
like a pimp?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.417
Bob says he's looking
for hungry,

06:58.502 --> 06:59.752
I think to
myself, "Tess."

06:59.836 --> 07:01.128
The rest
is up to you.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.756
Bob in Arbitrage.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.634
Bob Speck.
Extension 256.

07:06.718 --> 07:07.927
Expecting your call.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.804
Go get him, Tessie.

07:11.223 --> 07:14.391
Happy birthday to you

07:14.643 --> 07:17.603
- Happy birthday to you
- You should have told us!

07:18.021 --> 07:22.024
Happy birthday, dear Tess

07:22.359 --> 07:25.861
Happy birthday to you

07:26.947 --> 07:28.155
Thanks.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.542

07:43.130 --> 07:46.882
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Mmm

07:57.018 --> 07:58.477
Surprise!

07:58.770 --> 08:00.229
Hey!

08:00.355 --> 08:01.856
Happy birthday!

08:01.940 --> 08:03.440
Happy birthday.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.067
What is this?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.911
You look great.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.299
Come here.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.510
You know, Mick,
just once I could go

08:32.596 --> 08:34.804
for a sweater
or some earrings...

08:35.390 --> 08:37.683
a present
I could wear

08:37.767 --> 08:39.393
outside of
this apartment.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.033
So...
[Clears Throat]

08:54.993 --> 08:57.036
is this where you
usually meet for drinks?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.330
Mmm. This is a big week.
It's a super week.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.748
We are celebrating!

09:01.917 --> 09:03.334
So, Arbitrage...

09:03.793 --> 09:05.461
Talk about
adrenaline, huh?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.838
What do you think is
the most important quality...

09:07.923 --> 09:09.924
for a great arbitrager?

09:10.008 --> 09:11.675
We'll go through all that
at the hotel.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.345
- The hotel?
- Yeah.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.222
The company's suite
at the Ritz Carlton.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.933
When it's empty,
we boys get it on a bonus basis.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.185
Woo! We're going to party!

09:21.978 --> 09:24.855
Oh, allow me.
I'm so sorry.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.106
Hey! Bob, please!

09:26.191 --> 09:28.317
I'm sorry.
I get carried away.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.361
Mmm...

09:30.487 --> 09:34.323
Arbitrage has this
"introduction-to" tape

09:34.407 --> 09:35.449
for the business schools.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.660
Why don't we put it in,
and if you have questions...

09:37.827 --> 09:39.411
That would be great.
Thanks.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.676
It's the wrong tape,
unless you...

09:53.760 --> 09:55.427
Bob, you're not
seriously looking

09:55.512 --> 09:56.845
for a new assistant,
are you?

09:57.514 --> 09:59.598
Well, not exactly
at this moment.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.392
But I'm always looking
for new blood.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.811
I am hungry, Bob,
but not that hungry.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.938
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I would.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.190
Would you
pull over, please?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.566
What are you doing?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.735
No.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.070
Ha ha ha!

10:13.154 --> 10:14.571
Party, Bob.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.709
Ah!

10:43.393 --> 10:44.852
Hello, Tess.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.648
You're late, Tess.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.879
Yo, David!

11:19.679 --> 11:20.846
Bitch!

11:20.930 --> 11:22.723
You got to see this
to believe it.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.976
Hey, take it easy!

11:29.230 --> 11:31.106
Tess, Tess, Tess...

11:31.775 --> 11:32.900
I know.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.610
You don't get ahead

11:34.694 --> 11:36.612
by calling your boss
a pimp.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.364
Well, he is.

11:39.741 --> 11:43.285
This is the third time
in six months

11:43.370 --> 11:44.828
I had to place you.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.830
It wasn't my fault.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.791
Where have I
heard that before?

11:49.167 --> 11:51.502
Ruth, I'm 30 years old.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.003
Took me five years
of night school,

11:53.088 --> 11:55.214
but I got my degree
with honors.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.882
I know I could
do a job.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.260
You ask any
of my bosses, even Lutz,

12:00.345 --> 12:02.971
- if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.
- You ask 'em.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.307
They won't sing
your praises, Tess.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.981

12:21.324 --> 12:23.409
You go home
and cool off.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.868
O.K.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.371
Tess, this is
the last time

12:27.455 --> 12:28.580
I can help you.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.500
Four strikes,
you're out.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.675
Hi. Tess McGill
of Katharine Parker's office.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.011
It's the desk
at the end of the aisle.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.522
Look at this.
I'm telling you...

13:02.532 --> 13:03.699
Hi.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.216
I can't believe it.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.759
[Elevator Bell Rings]

13:22.844 --> 13:24.219
Shh! Shh! Shh!

13:39.527 --> 13:41.195
Hi. I'm Katharine Parker.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.738
You must be Tess.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.156
Hi.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.950
Oh, great bunny!

13:48.036 --> 13:50.787
I don't usually have
a bunny on my desk.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.415
It was my birthday
a few days ago.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.168
Mine's next Tuesday.
How old?

13:56.294 --> 13:57.336
30.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.546
Really? I'll be 30
next Tuesday.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.381
We're
practically twins.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.717
Except
that I'm older.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.093
Just barely.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.513
I've never
worked for somebody

14:07.597 --> 14:09.640
who was younger
than me before,

14:09.724 --> 14:10.766
or for a woman.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.268
There's a first time
for everything.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.938
That's not gonna be
a problem, is it, Tess?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.314
No... no.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.692
Pour us a couple of coffees
and come inside.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.403
I'm light, no sugar.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.745
The stock is 38.
The tender's at 56.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.413
- [Knock On Door]
- Come in.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.917
What do we do
about that?

14:37.001 --> 14:39.628
I just checked my three.
What are yours?

14:41.297 --> 14:43.048
Uh-huh. Yeah,
I have that one.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.301
Well, I think he's
in an underwater position.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.554
That's our first
and second call.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.430
Then we'll see
where we are.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.058
I'll count
the minutes. Bye.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.477
Thanks.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.648
So, Tess,
a few ground rules.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.402
The way I look at it, you are
my link with the outside world.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.946
People's impression of me
starts with you.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.489
You're tough
when it's warranted,

15:07.782 --> 15:11.618
accommodating when you can be,
accurate, punctual,

15:11.703 --> 15:13.287
and never make a promise
you can't keep.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.580
I'm never
on another line.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.164
I'm in a meeting.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.166
I consider us a team.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.918
As such,
we have a uniform...

15:20.003 --> 15:22.129
simple, elegant,
impeccable.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.548
"Dress shabbily,
they notice the dress.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.427
dress impeccably, they notice
the woman." Coco Chanel.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.389
Um... How do I look?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.559
You look terrific.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.811
You might want to
rethink the jewelry.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.358
I want your input.
I welcome ideas.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.360
I like to see
hard work rewarded.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.530
It's a two-way street on my team.
Am I making myself clear?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.450
Yes, Katharine.

15:54.871 --> 15:55.871
And call me Katharine.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.998
O.K.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.334
So, let's get
to work, shall we?

16:01.419 --> 16:04.338
This department's profile
last year was damn pitiful.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.882
Our team has got
its work cut out for it.

16:08.718 --> 16:09.801
O.K., thanks.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.556
Damn! I forgot
my pills again!

16:16.184 --> 16:17.684
Did you hear about

16:17.769 --> 16:19.311
that shot they got
in Europe?

16:19.395 --> 16:22.230
They give it to
the women in their arm,

16:22.315 --> 16:23.982
and it's good
for five years.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.068
The damn pills,
I'm always forgetting them.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.657
- I thought you might like this.
- Oh, thank you.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.412
Tess, would you come in
and bring a notebook?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.791
They've sold off the paper
and printing divisions.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.794
They sell distribution too,
we're talking scorched earth.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.629
Come on in.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.925
Tess, this is Ginny.
Ginny, Tess.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.262
I'm throwing
a cocktail thing

16:54.347 --> 16:56.014
to introduce myself
to the department.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.307
Ginny has
some great ideas.

16:57.392 --> 16:58.475
Will you
jot them down?

16:58.559 --> 17:02.813
- Sure.
- The caterer is Acme Eats.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.439
You can get the number
from information.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.608
They do the usual
hors d'oeuvres and such.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.069
The Raging Bull
has a bartender service.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.573
The liquor store on Broadway
and Liberty delivers.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.032
Got that, Bess?

17:15.117 --> 17:18.286
Tess. Yeah, if that's the way
you want to go.

17:19.789 --> 17:20.997
You have another idea?

17:21.582 --> 17:24.584
I was reading in W
about dim sum,

17:24.669 --> 17:26.211
little Chinese
dumplings.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.003
A restaurant
on Mott Street

17:28.089 --> 17:29.339
does them for
cocktail parties.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.967
I just love
those little dumplings.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.176
It might be more fun

17:33.261 --> 17:34.511
than the usual tidbits.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.929
I have it on my desk.
I could get it.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.099
- You read W?
- I read a lot of things.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.810
You never know where big ideas
could come from.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.354
Well, I guess
you're right,

17:44.480 --> 17:46.773
if dumplings can be considered
a big idea.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.735
That ought to
get you started.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.653
Ginny, thank you
so much.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.614
- Back to the gold mines.
- Right.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.199
You'll set those up?

17:56.284 --> 17:57.284
Right away.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.410
Dim sum, Tess.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.495
I like it,
contribution-wise.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.955
Keep it up.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.919
The chief says,
"We will respect your wish.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.546
"We will give you
an honorable death.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.964
But first, Kiki."

18:12.925 --> 18:15.343
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.720
Thank you.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.763
Dim sum?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.514
Uh, yes, yes, yes.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.433
Now, listen.
You work with him.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.768
Thank you.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.561
Keep with him.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.773
So come on, Katharine,
what do you say?

18:27.857 --> 18:29.649
Jim, the man who spends

18:29.734 --> 18:32.527
every weekend in August
glued to his desk

18:32.612 --> 18:35.614
knows I can't sneak out
of my own party.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.074
I'll tell you what,
though.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.328
Get me in on the Southeast Air
divestiture plan,

18:41.746 --> 18:43.455
I'll buy you a drink...

18:43.539 --> 18:46.166
a bottle of Crystal,
two straws.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.710
Deal?

18:48.878 --> 18:50.504
Okey-dokey.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.714
Dim sum?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.132
Hi.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.300
Thank you.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.635
What a slob.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.136
You were
so smooth with him.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.555
- I probably would have...
- Never burn bridges.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.224
Today's junior prick,

19:02.308 --> 19:04.142
tomorrow's senior partner.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.603
So how do you think
the party's going?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.230
Pretty well,
I think.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.357
Should I stop
serving now?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.235
Better make
one more round.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.822
I'd love to help you,
but you can't busy the quarterback

19:16.906 --> 19:18.156
with passing out
the Gatorade.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.700
Arnie, my hero,
you've come.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.507
Yeah?

19:38.594 --> 19:41.054
Um, I have an idea, and you said
I could come to you.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.931
Shoot.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.603
Well, you know
how Trask Industries

19:48.688 --> 19:51.147
has been looking to
buy into broadcasting?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.149
Something about
the department is...

19:53.234 --> 19:54.276
Working on it. Yeah.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.527
I've been
following it myself,

19:55.611 --> 19:57.571
and I suddenly
thought, "Radio."

19:58.865 --> 20:01.032
Trask is looking
for television stations.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.535
Well, so is every Tom,
Dick and Harry.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.037
My idea is that they
get their feet wet in radio

20:06.122 --> 20:07.205
and build
from there.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.958
It's not as glamorous
as jumping into TV,

20:10.042 --> 20:13.336
but it's a solid start,
and there's more of them for sale.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.589
It would solve
Trask's problem

20:15.673 --> 20:18.216
with Japanese competitors
trying to take him over.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.552
FCC forbids
foreign ownership

20:20.636 --> 20:22.512
of radio
as well as TV.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.434
Interesting.

20:27.518 --> 20:31.354
You've been, um...
following this, you say?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.106
Yeah.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.191
No chance
you overheard it,

20:35.318 --> 20:37.819
say, um...
on the elevator?

20:38.446 --> 20:39.821
No. No way.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.156
Somewhere?

20:41.782 --> 20:42.824
It's my idea.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.660
Good. Good.

20:48.331 --> 20:49.581
Discuss it
with anyone else?

20:50.124 --> 20:51.708
Nope. You think that

20:51.792 --> 20:53.126
there's something
there?

20:54.337 --> 20:55.587
I'll think it through
for you.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.797
Leave me your notes.
I'll have a look-see.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.008
O.K.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.428
Uh... I've been trying
to get into the entree program.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.013
This would be
a big push.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.932
If anything happens...

21:07.016 --> 21:10.060
Absolutely, Tess.
Two-way street, remember?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.188
Yeah. Thank you.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.628
It's just...
It's so exciting.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.880
I mean, she takes
me seriously.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.548
I think it's because...

21:40.633 --> 21:41.800
I know you hate
when I say this,

21:41.884 --> 21:43.969
but I think it's because
she's a woman.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.597
There's none of that
chasing-around-the-desk crap.

21:47.682 --> 21:51.893
It's like she wants to be my mentor,
which is what I needed.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.813
I feel like I'm finally
getting somewhere, Mick.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.523
Tess, that's great,
but let's step on it...

21:56.607 --> 21:58.650
or the pizza's
gonna freeze, honey.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.779
Maybe we could all
go out sometime...

22:02.863 --> 22:04.447
you know,
dinner in the city.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.950
You would like her,
I think.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.745
God, remember when all you had
to do was a few buckles?

22:10.955 --> 22:12.580
Yep. Those
were the days.

22:13.749 --> 22:14.958
I called the inn.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.211
All they can give you is a
ground-floor single in the new wing.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.715
Did you tell them
it was me?

22:22.842 --> 22:25.093
Well... I said Parker.

It's this tower room
with a canopy bed

23:05.551 --> 23:07.802

big enough to stand in.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.430
Perfect.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.890
Everything's in place.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.476
For what?

23:15.102 --> 23:17.020
The man I've been
seeing for a while.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.898
I think he's it,

23:19.982 --> 23:22.942
and this could be
the weekend we decide.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.694
He said there was
something very important

23:24.779 --> 23:26.696
he wanted to discuss
with me.

23:27.281 --> 23:30.200
- I think he's gonna pop the question.
- You do?

23:30.284 --> 23:32.535
I think so.
We're in the same city.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.705
I've indicated
that I'm receptive to an offer,

23:35.790 --> 23:37.415
I've cleared June,

23:37.500 --> 23:39.709
and I am,
after all, me.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.172
Well, what if he doesn't
pop the question?

23:45.674 --> 23:47.759
I really don't think
that's a variable.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.178
Tess, you know,

23:50.262 --> 23:51.596
you don't get anywhere
in this world

23:51.680 --> 23:54.432
by waiting for what you want
to come to you.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.893
You make it happen.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.521
Watch me, Tess.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.564
Learn from me.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.986
Oh, I ran your
Trask radio idea

24:07.071 --> 24:08.363
by some
of our people.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.032
It seems Trask
is dead set on television.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.035
It wasn't out
in left field.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.578
I really
like the idea.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.748
Keep plugging.
Bring me your ideas.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.208
We'll see
what we can do.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.378
Thank you, Katharine.

Tess.

24:25.673 --> 24:28.466
Tess, look at me.

24:28.801 --> 24:29.926
Who makes it happen?

24:32.596 --> 24:33.847
I do.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.723
Who does?

24:37.852 --> 24:39.602
I do.
I make it happen.

24:40.229 --> 24:43.731
That's right. Only then
do we get what we deserve.

you to do.

an awful lot, Tess.

what else to do.

26:42.017 --> 26:45.311
Na na na na

26:45.437 --> 26:48.356
Da-a-um

26:48.440 --> 26:51.359
Mmm

26:58.075 --> 27:03.246
Ah ah ah ah

27:03.330 --> 27:09.210
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh

27:09.295 --> 27:13.840
Ooh ooh

27:13.924 --> 27:17.552
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

27:17.636 --> 27:24.976
Ooh ooh

27:25.811 --> 27:29.063
[Katharine] Regarding those horrid
little knickknacks from the Alberts...

27:29.565 --> 27:30.732
Dear Eleanor and Gary,

27:30.858 --> 27:33.443
Thank you for the beautiful
salt and pepper shakers.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.987
Not only are they the perfect
housewarming gift,

27:36.071 --> 27:37.655
but it was dear of you
to think of me

27:37.740 --> 27:39.907
so far away.

27:40.909 --> 27:44.037
Dear Sister,
It's been eight years

27:44.121 --> 27:46.080
since we said good-bye
to Wellesley.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.541
Of course, we never really
say good-bye.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.043
On behalf of...

27:50.127 --> 27:52.754
the Alumni Giving Fund...

27:58.260 --> 27:59.719
Dear Sister...

27:59.928 --> 28:01.929
It's been
eight years...

28:02.014 --> 28:04.098
since we said
good-bye to Wellesley.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.516
of course,
we never really...

28:05.601 --> 28:06.684
say good-bye.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.853
On behalf of the Alumni
Giving Fund,

28:08.937 --> 28:10.980
I am writing
to you to ask...

28:14.443 --> 28:17.695
To ask...
To ask... To ask.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.863
To ask...

28:18.947 --> 28:21.991
I am writing
to you to ask...

28:22.951 --> 28:24.494
Dear Momo and Ba...

28:25.162 --> 28:26.662
Momo and Ba.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.791
...the New York
real estate market,

28:29.917 --> 28:31.834
looking for
a place of my own.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.878
Of course, it makes me
miss you all terribly,

28:33.962 --> 28:35.421
but it will be
so lovely to see you

28:35.506 --> 28:37.215
when you return
from Barbados.

28:37.299 --> 28:41.135
Till then, have fun.
Much love to you and to Claudette.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.804
Love, Kiki.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.474
To Jack Trainer,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.226
Dewey, Stone & Company,
from me,

28:48.310 --> 28:51.104
RE Trask Industries
radio network acquisition.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.148
Um, hard copy on this
from the home computer.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.983
Do not go through Tess.

29:00.697 --> 29:01.948
To Jack Trainer,

29:02.032 --> 29:03.783
Dewey, Stone & Company,
from me,

29:03.867 --> 29:06.911
RE Trask Industries
radio network acquisition.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.831
Um, hard copy on this
from the home computer.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.457
Do not go through Tess.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.018
Two-way street...

29:32.396 --> 29:34.730
And you make it happen.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.607
What, no class?

30:18.317 --> 30:19.525
No class.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.237
Tess, this is not
what it looks like.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.199
I mean it is,
but I can explain.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.784
Well, not
exactly explain...

30:29.077 --> 30:30.578
You snake.

30:33.457 --> 30:34.582
Shit.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.800
Come on, Tess!
I'm sorry! I really am!

30:45.802 --> 30:48.554
I love you!
Come on!

30:48.931 --> 30:50.556
Come back
and hit me!

30:51.725 --> 30:53.267
Please!

31:38.146 --> 31:41.315
[In Nasal Voice]
Hello. Mr. Trainer's office, please.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.567
[Clears Throat]

31:42.651 --> 31:44.986
Hello. Tess McGill calling
from Petty-Marsh.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.487
May I put her through?

31:46.822 --> 31:48.281
Thank you.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.661
[Normal Voice]
Mr. Trainer?

31:54.162 --> 31:55.580
Hi. This is Tess McGill.

31:55.664 --> 31:56.914
I work
with Katharine Parker

31:56.999 --> 31:59.000
over here in Mergers
and Acquisitions.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.127
I have a proposal

32:01.211 --> 32:03.212
that I'd like
to discuss with you.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.506
Not over the phone, though.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.344
Um, I have an opening
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.180
O.K.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.517
I'll messenger an outline
over to you right now.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.103
Bye.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.356
Whew.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.334
Yes, I'm calling
for Katharine Parker

32:41.418 --> 32:43.252
in regard
to your invitation.

32:43.337 --> 32:44.545
Miss Parker
is out of town,

32:44.630 --> 32:47.548
but Miss Tess McGill
will be attending in her place.

32:48.008 --> 32:49.884
Thank you. Bye.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.898
Why does it do that?

33:04.900 --> 33:06.317
For cleaning.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.902
Are you kidding me?

33:08.403 --> 33:09.987
No.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.453
What is this thing
you're going to, anyway?

33:17.537 --> 33:20.414
A closing party for
the Minadine-Dalton merger.

33:20.791 --> 33:21.916
Dewey-Stone's
throwing it,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.417
which is where
Jack Trainer works.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.754
Mix business
with pleasure.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.673
Fringe times are crucial.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.883
Did you snatch
her invite?

33:31.426 --> 33:33.219
Well, she can't use it.

33:33.303 --> 33:36.681
It's important for me
to interact with people

33:36.765 --> 33:38.015
not as a secretary.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.017
But as
a total impostor.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.394
Right.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.606
This is it.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.152
It needs some bows
or something.

33:51.405 --> 33:52.571
No.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.700
It's simple, elegant,
yet makes a statement.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.703
Says to people,
confident, a risk-taker,

33:59.037 --> 34:00.579
not afraid
to be noticed.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.165
Then you hit them
with your smarts.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.000
Here. Shoes.
I need shoes.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.338
$6,000?

34:09.422 --> 34:11.340
It's not
even leather!

34:13.301 --> 34:14.969
$6,000?

34:18.014 --> 34:19.974
$6,000?

34:20.809 --> 34:21.891
Cyn...

34:21.976 --> 34:23.310
I can't breathe
so good.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.978
Oh, God, come here.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.981
Sit down.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.400
Let's see if she's got
anything soothing.

34:42.873 --> 34:43.956
Valium.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.000
In the convenient
economy size.

34:46.752 --> 34:47.877
You sure?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.545
It just chills you ever so slightly.
You won't even notice it.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.510
Ohh.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.346
Are you sure
about this?

35:00.515 --> 35:02.183
You want to be
taken seriously,

35:02.267 --> 35:04.143
you need serious hair.

35:07.773 --> 35:08.814
Hmm.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.515
[Man] I've been telling you
this for three weeks.

35:42.599 --> 35:46.519
We got 25%.
We get another 5%,

35:46.603 --> 35:48.103
we've got them
by the throat.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.605
[Woman] Listen, Trainer,
let's grab them by the balls.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.649
- Leave our hearts at home.
- Cut them off at the knees.

35:51.733 --> 35:54.443
They'll be eating out of our hands.
What do you say?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.488
Anybody thirsty?

35:58.198 --> 35:59.615
We need
this one, Trainer.

35:59.699 --> 36:00.991
You need this one.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.757
I've been
looking for you.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.635
Why? Do you know me?

36:19.761 --> 36:22.429
No, but I promised myself
that when I saw you,

36:22.973 --> 36:24.807
I would
get to know you.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.476
You're the first woman I've seen
at one of these things

36:27.561 --> 36:28.686
that dresses
like a woman,

36:28.770 --> 36:31.480
not like a woman thinks
a man would if he was a woman.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.858
Thank you, I guess.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.860
What are you
doing here?

36:36.278 --> 36:38.237
I'm looking
for someone myself.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.572
His name
is Jack Trainer.

36:39.656 --> 36:40.948
He works
at Dewey-Stone.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.825
Do you know
if he's here?

36:43.451 --> 36:45.327
Why are you
looking for him?

36:46.121 --> 36:48.289
I have a meeting
with him tomorrow,

36:48.373 --> 36:50.332
and I thought I might
say hello

36:50.417 --> 36:51.834
and get a head start.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.212
Well, he, uh...

36:56.423 --> 36:57.965
just left.

36:59.593 --> 37:00.968
Oh.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.721
Well, I should
be going myself.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.389
Well, have a drink
with me.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.766
I can't.
What's your name?

37:09.019 --> 37:10.561
No. No names,

37:10.937 --> 37:12.354
no business cards,

37:12.480 --> 37:14.189
no "You must know
so and so."

37:14.274 --> 37:15.774
- What is this?
- No resumes.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.568
Let's just meet
like human beings,

37:17.652 --> 37:19.153
for once.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.407
It's nice to meet you,
whatever your name is,

37:23.491 --> 37:24.992
but I really do
have to go.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.493
Please?

37:26.620 --> 37:28.412
Please... one drink.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.751
O.K., one drink,
but I'm buying.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.170
O.K., but it's
an open bar.

37:36.546 --> 37:37.755
Right. I knew that.

37:37.839 --> 37:38.923
I meant that
if it wasn't,

37:39.007 --> 37:41.216
- I would be buying.
- Yeah.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.552
Tequila gold.
Doubles.

37:44.137 --> 37:45.179
Tequila.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.681
I promised myself
that when we met,

37:47.766 --> 37:49.183
we'd drink tequila.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.645
No Chardonnay,
no frog water.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.356
Real drinks.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.276
Ha ha.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.784
Oh.

38:06.910 --> 38:07.993
Yeah.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.621
These things
are usually...

38:10.705 --> 38:12.498
so boring.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.875
Ha ha ha!

38:15.210 --> 38:16.585
I wouldn't know.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.797
Power to the people.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.759
The little people.

38:29.432 --> 38:34.269
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.563
Ha ha! You O.K?

38:36.731 --> 38:38.148
I'm fine.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.525
I'm just fine.

38:39.609 --> 38:40.693
I took a...

38:40.777 --> 38:43.654
um, antihistamine
before,

38:43.738 --> 38:45.197
and it just...

38:45.281 --> 38:46.907
makes for
a nice little buzz.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.075
Oh?

38:48.368 --> 38:50.119
I didn't know
they let bad girls

38:50.203 --> 38:51.620
into these things.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.415
Do I look like
I don't belong here?

38:54.624 --> 38:59.628
No, no, I'm sure
you're a real ace

38:59.713 --> 39:02.089
at whatever it is
that you do do.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.465
Damn straight.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.175
But how you look...

39:08.930 --> 39:11.098
I have a head
for business

39:11.182 --> 39:13.100
and a bod for sin.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.352
Is there anything
wrong with that?

39:17.105 --> 39:19.064
No. No.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.195
Hello! Hi!

39:26.114 --> 39:27.614
And I have to
go now.

39:28.241 --> 39:29.366
Well, I'll come
with you.

39:29.451 --> 39:30.617
No.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.328
Hey, Tess!

39:36.207 --> 39:37.207
Uh...

39:37.292 --> 39:38.459
Uh...

39:38.585 --> 39:39.793
Tess!

39:46.426 --> 39:48.385
I need some air.
Meet me outside.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.470
Thank you.

39:57.479 --> 39:58.645
Excuse me, please.

40:16.831 --> 40:17.956
Hello?

40:18.041 --> 40:19.083
Hi.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.250
Hi.

40:20.335 --> 40:21.627
Hello.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.171
Oh.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.510
Where do you live?

40:29.803 --> 40:31.011
Hmm?

40:32.180 --> 40:33.388
Where do you live?

40:34.057 --> 40:35.099
Mmm...

40:35.183 --> 40:36.183
park...

40:36.267 --> 40:37.851
trees...

40:38.103 --> 40:39.686
tall building.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.191
166 Morton, near Hudson.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.484
166 Morton.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.457
It might be
kind of a mess.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.210
The cleaning lady
keeps changing...

41:04.003 --> 41:05.504
days on me.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.798
Anybody's guess.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.050
I'm just warning
you 'cause...

41:10.593 --> 41:12.719
if it's
the day before,

41:13.221 --> 41:15.180
it could be
pretty bad.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.186
I don't notice
so much myself,

41:21.980 --> 41:24.189
but some of the people
I've had over have,

41:25.066 --> 41:26.483
you know,

41:26.901 --> 41:28.861
remarked on it.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.415
It's not so bad.

42:28.004 --> 42:29.463
Would you...

42:30.715 --> 42:32.633
Would you like
a nightcap?

42:35.803 --> 42:37.262
I guess not.

42:38.806 --> 42:39.890
Uh...

42:40.391 --> 42:42.309

television station,

46:12.520 --> 46:14.146

unsuccessfully.

46:14.897 --> 46:17.399

fighting off
a hostile takeover

46:19.152 --> 46:21.361

Japanese competitors.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.321
Ahem.

46:23.448 --> 46:24.865
Buying into radio
would,

46:24.991 --> 46:26.158
in one fell swoop,

46:26.242 --> 46:27.951
accomplish
two important tasks.

46:28.244 --> 46:31.455
It would give Trask
a solid base in broadcasting,

46:31.539 --> 46:33.457
and because of
FCC regulations

46:33.541 --> 46:35.959
forbidding foreign
ownership of radio stations,

46:36.043 --> 46:38.628
it would wipe out
the threat of a Japanese takeover.

Trask has got a lot
of cash on their balance sheet.

47:00.568 --> 47:02.360
Well, I've already
thought of that.

47:03.321 --> 47:05.238
I figure that we look
for a radio network,

47:05.323 --> 47:07.574
one with
a real high profile,

47:07.658 --> 47:09.701
then with
the surplus cash,

47:09.785 --> 47:12.245
we implement a major
stock repurchase.

47:13.789 --> 47:16.750
So Trask is protected,
and their stock goes up,

on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.

55:21.235 --> 55:22.694
That's so great.

55:32.788 --> 55:34.914
Never seen you
looking so lovely

55:35.040 --> 55:37.250
As you did tonight

55:37.418 --> 55:40.128
I've never seen you
shine so bright

55:40.754 --> 55:43.089
Hmm hmm hmm mmm

55:45.426 --> 55:47.010
Never seen so many men

55:47.094 --> 55:49.429
Ask you if
you wanted to dance

55:50.139 --> 55:52.932
Looking for
a little romance

55:53.434 --> 55:56.352
Given half a chance

55:57.771 --> 56:00.606
I have never seen
that dress you're wearing

56:00.983 --> 56:03.276
Or the highlights
in your hair

56:03.360 --> 56:05.903
That catch your eye

56:06.238 --> 56:08.740
I have been blind

56:08.949 --> 56:12.618
Lady in red

56:12.953 --> 56:14.245
Woo!

56:14.747 --> 56:17.123
"Hours of fun
for the entire family.

56:17.207 --> 56:19.125
Love, Tess and Mick."

56:19.293 --> 56:20.293
Thank you.

56:22.838 --> 56:24.297
I put from both of us.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.466
I didn't know if
you'd gotten something.

56:27.176 --> 56:29.135
O.K., toast.
We need a toast!

56:31.764 --> 56:32.930
Thank you,
thank you.

56:33.015 --> 56:35.558
From me and Tess,
and everybody here,

56:35.642 --> 56:37.810
may your life together
be long and happy,

56:37.895 --> 56:40.229
and may the road always
rise up to meet you.

56:40.314 --> 56:41.731
Hear, hear!

56:44.151 --> 56:45.902
When will we toast
the two of you?

56:45.986 --> 56:46.986
Yeah!

56:47.780 --> 56:49.030
Ha ha ha!

56:50.240 --> 56:52.575
Well, we haven't
really discussed it.

56:52.659 --> 56:54.243
I mean,
not recently.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.162
You don't discuss it,
you just ask.

56:56.288 --> 56:57.705
That's right.

56:58.165 --> 56:59.248
Here?

56:59.333 --> 57:00.416
Yeah!

57:00.501 --> 57:01.626
Now?

57:01.710 --> 57:02.752
Yeah!

57:02.836 --> 57:04.045
On your knees, man.

57:05.089 --> 57:06.172
Mick! Mick!

57:06.340 --> 57:09.258
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!

57:09.343 --> 57:12.386
Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick!

57:12.513 --> 57:14.305
Yeah!

57:14.598 --> 57:15.765
Ya-hah!

57:15.891 --> 57:17.183
Yeah! Woo!

57:19.520 --> 57:20.603
Here!

57:23.273 --> 57:25.191
Tess, will you marry me?

57:27.528 --> 57:28.736
Maybe.

57:29.071 --> 57:30.238
Ooh!

57:30.781 --> 57:32.281
That's an answer?

57:34.326 --> 57:36.869
You want another answer,
ask another girl.

57:37.204 --> 57:38.329
[Man]
Whoa!

57:38.580 --> 57:39.664
Sssss!

57:39.748 --> 57:40.706
Ha ha!

57:53.137 --> 57:55.012
You fuckin'
humiliated us in there.

57:55.097 --> 57:59.809
You set us up. What did you expect me
to do, lie in front of those people...

57:59.893 --> 58:02.436
- and automatically say yes?
- Didn't know you'd have to lie.

58:02.521 --> 58:04.438
I thought you would
want me to ask.

58:04.523 --> 58:07.316
Three nights ago,
I find you in bed with Doreen.

58:07.401 --> 58:10.111
We have a drink and a dance,
then you want an answer

58:10.195 --> 58:12.905
- about the rest of my life.
- All right. O.K.

58:13.407 --> 58:16.367
Here we are.
Will you marry me or what?

58:16.785 --> 58:19.245
Jesus, Mick.
Do we have to decide now?

58:19.413 --> 58:22.123
I want to get things
solidified in my life.

58:22.249 --> 58:24.167
You're not the only one
who's got plans.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.169
I said maybe.

58:26.253 --> 58:29.589
Maybe means dick!
Fuck maybe! I want an answer!

58:30.048 --> 58:32.884
Please don't yell.
You treat me like...

58:32.968 --> 58:35.761
Why do we always end up talking
about the way you get treated?

58:35.846 --> 58:38.097
Who the fuck died
and made you Grace Kelly?

58:39.391 --> 58:40.892
I am not steak.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.060
You can't
just order me.

58:43.228 --> 58:44.478
I don't need this.

58:44.563 --> 58:46.522
You get your priorities straight,
maybe we'll talk.

58:46.607 --> 58:48.191
Right now,
we're history.

59:12.382 --> 59:13.883
[Ring]

59:17.095 --> 59:18.638
Katharine Parker's office.

59:20.015 --> 59:23.142
Um... I'll
switch you over.

59:24.353 --> 59:25.436
[Knock On Door]

59:25.520 --> 59:26.979
Tess, it's me.

59:31.360 --> 59:32.526
I couldn't find
the right shoes.

59:32.611 --> 59:33.611
Shh!

59:36.073 --> 59:37.782
Tess McGill's office.

59:38.408 --> 59:39.617
Who's calling?

59:40.035 --> 59:41.911
One moment, please.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.288
Ahem...

59:44.790 --> 59:45.873
Jack.

59:46.250 --> 59:48.584
Went well
in Memphis. Yeah.

59:48.669 --> 59:50.294
Really well,
I think.

59:50.420 --> 59:52.880
We'll have to move fast
and hit them high.

59:53.131 --> 59:56.259
Armbrister thinks
of Metro as family.

59:56.343 --> 59:58.261
You know how that can be.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.137
He's willing to listen.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:03.099
We got to get Trask
to talk sweet.

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.101
He's thinking
about 70 mill.

01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:08.813
I've been up here all night,
working the numbers.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:10.731
I'd like to go
over it with you.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:12.441
Can we meet for lunch?

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:16.279
Lunch is all right, isn't it?
Daylight, lot of people around.

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.781
There's a real romantic
souvlaki stand

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.783
in front
of your place.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:23.828
You're in no particular
danger, I think.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.710
Yeah. Meet you there
around 1:00.

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.254
O.K., I'll see you
then. Bye.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.550
Mick's really raw.

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:40.636
He says
he's going to throw

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.346
the rest
of your stuff out.

01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:47.101
He kept talking at me
till 5:00 this morning.

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:49.603
Oh, God, Cyn,
I'm sorry.

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:54.775
How hard would it be
to crash a wedding?

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.485
What are you
talking about?

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.821
Oren Trask's daughter
is getting married tomorrow.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:03.242
There's a reception following,
so I figured I blend in,

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.910
I get to Trask.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.871
I mean, how hard
could that be?

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.666
The wedding party's
not going to admit

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.126
they've never
seen you before.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.587
Nobody knows everybody
at those things, right?

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:17.089
- Tess, wait a minute...
- All I need is five minutes.

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.258
Tess, I'm
talking to you.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.260
What?

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.013
First of all,
look me in the eye

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.683
and tell me you're not thinking,
even in your wildest dreams,

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:29.852
Mr. Briefcase-
Let's-Have-Lunch

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.271
will take you away
from all of this.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.941
We're doing a deal
together, that's all.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.444
You'll get
your heart stomped

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.196
just like you're
stomping Mick's.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.949
It wasn't me popping
Doreen Dimucci in our bed.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.619
How come you're
all on his side?

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.245
I'm not.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.373
You're not even
giving him

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:53.667
the chance to make it up to you,
and that's not like you.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:57.755
If you're so smart,
why don't you act smart

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.590
and save your ass
while you still can?

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:03.135
You're not going
to have any job.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.305
You're out of
your man and home already.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:07.640
I'm going to
come clean

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.725
as soon as I get
my end set up.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.978
I swear.
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.147
So do I.
You're screwin' up your life.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.400
No, I'm trying
to make it better.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.568
I won't spend
the rest of my life

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.737
working my ass off
and getting nowhere

01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:25.157
because I followed rules
I didn't set up.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.660
[Telephone Rings]

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.497
Tess McGill's office.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:33.416
Katharine!

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.960
Of course it's
still your office.

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.211
I don't know...

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:38.921
I'll see you, Tess.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.591
Cyn.

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:50.015
Sometimes I dance around
the house in my underwear.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.185
It doesn't make me
Madonna... never will.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.314
[Katharine]
Umm... are you there?

01:02:58.024 --> 01:02:59.191
Yes, Katharine.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:01.944
Don't get too used
to those long lunches.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.988
They're letting me go
a week from today.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:07.324
Isn't that a little faster
than you thought?

01:03:07.576 --> 01:03:10.035
The doctor says
I've got great bones.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.204
Of course, his aren't
too bad, either.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.330
Ha ha ha!

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:16.709
Anyway, I need you
to summarize...

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:19.670
Hi, Shatz!

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:23.382
Send that along with the last
two quarterly reports.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.217
You are a sport.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:27.511
Yes, I am a sport.

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.805
Thanks. I'll talk
to you soon.

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.265
O.K. Bye.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.355
What kind of figures
have you thrown at them?

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.983
No exact figures yet.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:42.902
Well, what's
their ballpark?

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.822
I wanted to get them
excited about the concept

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.949
before I started throwing
actual figures at them.

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:50.618
Are they excited?

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:52.244
They're going to be.

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:55.414
Wait a minute.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:58.167
I've been working
on this for 36 hours

01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.460
trying to put it
together.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:03.380
I got a progress meeting with
the head of my department at 2:00.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:05.090
Where the hell
are we?

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:06.300
Don't yell at me.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.093
Hey, answer me.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.555
Well, as a matter
of fact,

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.016
I'm going to see
Trask himself tomorrow.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.852
I feel we're strong enough
to go right to him.

01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:19.313
Where are we meeting him?
What time?

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.107
He's not expecting
both of us.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.613
Are you trying to
fly this thing without me?

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.866
No... I wouldn't
do that.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.953
You set up this meeting without me.
What does that say?

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.996
What the hell kind of way
to do business is this?

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:37.623
Would you calm down?

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.625
How am I supposed
to calm down?

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.795
One lost deal is all it takes
to get canned.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.591
My phone will have
an inch of tape...

01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:48.884
the names
of new guys

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:50.219
over the names
of old guys...

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.263
good men who aren't
there anymore

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:55.641
because
of one lost deal.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:59.728
I don't want to get
buried under tape.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.649
No one's trying to
bury you under tape.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:06.277
So I've been
in a little slump.

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:08.862
I'm not afraid to admit it.
There it is.

01:05:08.989 --> 01:05:11.240
But give me a break.
Don't go leaving me out.

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:14.326
If you've got doubts about me, say
them to my face. Give me that much.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.495
I don't have
any doubts about you.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.790
O.K.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:23.544
You need me,
you know.

01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:26.338
I mean any doubts
about your abilities.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.591
You need me
at that meeting.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.637
Is he jet lagged,
or he just lunches late?

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:36.473
3:00 is
a late lunch.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:40.019
It's not exactly lunch,
but there will be food.

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.438
What's
the story, Tess?

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.440
It's his daughter's
wedding.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.442
That's
the meeting?

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.486
It's the perfect opportunity.
He's happy, he's had a little champagne,

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.697
we look for an opening...
trust me.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.325
Are we supposed to
jump out of the cake?

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.619
Don't be silly.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.646
Welcome to our party.
Come in.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.610
Hello.
Nice to see you.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:31.362
Do you know which
table you're at?

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:33.238
- No.
- Yes.

01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:34.740
I do, darling.

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:36.867
Oh, I see Phyllis.
Come on.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:45.668
Glad you could
make it.

and Barbara Trask.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.130
Tess McGill.
What a great idea.

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:52.091
- Jack Trainer.
- So nice to see you again.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:54.426
The kids thought
it would be fun.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:57.096
- You must be friends of Mark's.
- Right.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.597
Let's get you over there.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.017
Actually, I really should
go powder my bathroom... nose.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.395
- Darling, will you wait here?
- Sure.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.146
It's so nice
to see you... later.

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:08.774
I think
I'll get a drink.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:10.567

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:14.697
Who's he?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:19.702
Wow!

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.123
He is
gorgeous.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.669
He's
so cute.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.257
Mm-hmm.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:38.095
Get a grip.
Tess, get a grip.

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:41.515
Ahem...

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.650
We're not even invited
to this thing, are we?

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.986
So we're not
exactly invited,

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.780
but he's here and we're here,
so that makes us...

01:07:56.865 --> 01:07:57.906
Total idiots.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.992
In the right place
at the right time.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.036
You're like one
of those crazed cops...

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:05.247
the kind nobody
wants to ride with

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:08.292
because his partners
end up dead or crazy.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.669
Just act
like you belong.

Oh... Do you love it,
or do you hate it?

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:23.474
Love it.

01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:25.225
So do I,

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.185
but Mark says
it looks like Nicaragua

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.645
and we're making
some statement.

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:33.066
Oh, no. It's
just like paradise.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:36.862
It's like paradise
with little gold palm trees.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.197
Ha ha ha.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.782

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:41.492
You're welcome.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:46.078
I hope I'm not
being rude,

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.165
but...
who are you?

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:53.045
I'm Tess.
I'm a friend of Mark's.

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:58.801

for you today.

Stunning. Really.

You're right.
This is crazy,

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:30.415
so let's
just go.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.670
Excuse me.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:37.421
The woman dancing with Oren,
what's her name?

Oh, Elizabeth
Stowenfield.

That's right.

Uh... Liz? Beth?

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:45.138

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:46.723
Bitsy. That's right.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.100

You want to do it,

Excuse us.
Bitsy, don't break my heart

01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:58.777
and tell me
you don't remember me.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.280
Of course I do.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:02.781
Excuse us.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:08.787
Ha ha ha!
Talk about a small world, huh?

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:11.248
I mean,
here we've just met,

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:12.708
and yet I feel

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:15.043
I've spent so much time
working with you.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:19.172
I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions
at Petty-Marsh.

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:22.301
I wish we were having
more luck with your team.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.636
So do I. So do I.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:28.056
I've tried to set you up
with a radio network,

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:31.810
but my bosses think you're stuck
on acquiring television.

01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:34.021
That's not true.

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:37.566
I said, the man
who in 1971

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:38.942
looked into the future

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:41.778
and saw that it was named
microwave technology,

01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:44.406
the man who applied
Japanese management principles

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.242
while others were
still kowtowing to the unions,

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:50.913
the man who saw the Ma Bell
breakup coming...

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:54.791
this man did not get to be
this man... you, I mean...

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:57.461
by shutting himself
off to new ideas.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:59.212

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:02.341
- I think you're right.
- Damn straight, I'm right.

If you've got the right property,
I'd love to hear about it.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:05.844
You would?

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:06.970
Absolutely.

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:08.263
There she is.

of the bride,

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:15.437

coming in.

What do you say
that I call you on Monday?

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.484

is Tim Draper.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.194

his people Monday.

the man who said,

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:38.085
what if we slice
the bread before we sold it?

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:42.798
- All right.
- No, no, no. I loved it. I had fun,

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.299

The Fort Worth station
projected revenues

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.982
should read
up 8% not 6,

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:04.069
and where it says
the FCC ruling

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.155
on Metro's Memphis
transmitter is pending,

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.825
that's outdated.
FCC approved it Friday.

the signal reach.

value by 30%.

And now, back to our regularly
scheduled programming.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.271
I guess we're ready.

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:48.864
- Yes. Top of the stairs.
- Thank you.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.548
Are we waiting
for Mr. Trask?

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:09.968
Mr. Trask doesn't
sit in at this level.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.345
Of course
he doesn't.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:15.057
Ahem... Here's
the way we see it...

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:19.144
Trask Industries has
two important needs at this time.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.730
By acquiring
Metro Radio Network,

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:24.149
you nail two birds
with one stone.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:28.487
Do you have any proposals
besides Metro?

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:30.697
No. Why?

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.657
Metro's a terrific
opportunity.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.911
I'm sure it is,
but a Chicago group

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:39.915
just put a bear hug on Metro
this morning... the company's in play.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.834
Just this morning?

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.002
Who?

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:46.004
The Slade Brothers.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:49.132
Trask isn't aiming
at radio anyway.

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:51.760
We don't want to get
into a bidding war.

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:54.596
A moment, please.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.600
Armbrister looks at Metro
as part of his family.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.185
He cares who
he's selling to.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.020
Yes...
and he holds

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:03.814
the majority
of the stock.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:08.360
If the Slades
are uninvited...

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.237
and I'm sure
they are...

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.615
and Armbrister and Trask can
agree on a deal,

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.283
then we won't
have a war.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:18.203
If I get Armbrister,
will Trask meet him?

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:21.748

Mr. Trask?

Yes, it was.

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:53.905

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:30.223
We were supposed to go away
a couple weeks ago,

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.308
and I was going to
tell her then,

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:35.311
but I had to work,
and I never got there.

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:38.982
It's just
a... timing thing.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.777
It's just she broke
her leg skiing,

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:45.947
and I couldn't see
doing it over the phone.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:48.992
You know, kicking somebody
when they're down.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:55.290
I wouldn't
have mentioned it,

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.041
except she's in your department
at Petty.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.544
You mentioned her
the first time you called.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:01.880
Katharine.

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:04.549
Parker, yeah.

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:10.805
Now, what did you
want to tell me, huh?

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:14.684
Oh, it's not important.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.855
120 even.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.995
Oh, Miss, you
forgot your book.

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:17.288
Ha ha ha ha!

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:22.794
Tess, it's me.
I'm back.

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.504
Thanks.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.299
Oh, God.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:31.261
She took a muscle relaxant
for the flight down.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:33.805
- Let's all have one, shall we?
- I don't think so.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.932
Oh, I need
a telephone.

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:39.102
Oh, Tess, take care of the bags.
I'll meet you at the car.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:40.979
O Tannenbaum

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.397
O Tannenbaum

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:43.856
Oh, I love these pills.

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:47.569
Just for a minute,
Jack... please.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:50.863
I must see you,
darling.

01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:52.615
My apartment
in one hour,

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.742
and I won't take no
for an answer.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:56.744
No, I won't take no
for an answer.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:02.375
Oh, I'm home!
I'm home! I'm home!

01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:04.002
Oh...

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.504
Oh, God.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.553
Did you happen
to see this?

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:14.637
What is it?

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:17.682
It's your idea for a Trask
radio acquisition.

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:21.185
I was planning to send it
to Jack Trainer...

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:23.521
give your idea
one last go-round.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.107
But it occurs to me,
looking at it,

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:27.984
that it reads as though
it were my idea.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.863
Jack got burned once...
he was accused

01:22:32.323 --> 01:22:34.407
of stealing a plan
for taking a company private.

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.659
He's very sticky about
the ethics of reviewing

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.703
other people's
formative strategies.

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:40.246
He wouldn't have
looked at it

01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:41.831
if I'd said it was
from a colleague,

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:45.293
and I couldn't very well
say it was a secretary's notion.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:48.212
Anyway, the point is that
I'm trying to get you heard.

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:49.672
Oh.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.215
What am I saying?

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:53.134
If you had seen it,

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:55.470
you simply would have
asked me about it.

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:56.679
Trust.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.894
I'll need help
bathing and changing.

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:08.900
Oh, I need something
to cover this cast.

01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:11.444
There's an afghan
on the chair.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:15.740
Perfect.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.325
If that
will be all...

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:18.826
Oh, and some perfume.

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:22.413
Uhh... shalimar.
on the dresser.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.250
He loves shalimar.

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:29.420
He who?

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:30.672
Jack Trainer who.

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.757
He's on
his way over.

01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:35.551
I have to go...
doctor's appointment.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:36.969
Oh, one last thing...

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:39.889
Run to the drugstore
and get my pills.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:41.432
I really
have to go.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.226
The doctor
will understand.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:45.561
Thanks.

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:03.162
Keep the change.

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:13.005
Who is it?

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:14.549
It's Jack.

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.135
[Buzz]

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.476
Katharine?

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.311
In the bedroom.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:33.609
Jack.

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.027
Katharine.

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:39.115
Boy, did I ever
miss you.

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.366
Ha ha ha.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:42.493
Does it hurt?

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:43.745
Look at you.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:45.371
You said
it was urgent.

01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:48.040
I'd forgotten how damn
handsome you are.

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:50.668
Thanks. Look, uh...

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:53.921
I meant what I said.
I'm really swamped...

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:57.425
Some welcome home.
I haven't even gotten a kiss.

01:24:58.051 --> 01:24:59.343
Ha ha ha!

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.014
Ahh... hmm...

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:07.185
There's some champagne
in the little fridge.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.187
You want to get it
for us?

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:13.191
Sure, and then
I really do have to go.

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:28.998
[Pop]

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.250
Where are
the glasses?

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:33.211
Try the dishwasher.

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:45.723
There you are.

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.064
You know
I love you.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.857
You know that.

01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:58.319
Katharine, I really do
have to get going.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:25:59.612
These past few weeks,

01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:03.324
I've heard this funny sound
down deep inside.

01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:07.662
Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.789
My biological clock.

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:12.333
Big deal going.
Principals are meeting...

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:16.087
And I've been thinking...
let's merge...

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:18.047
you and I.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.757
Think of it, darling.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:22.593
Mr. and Mrs.
Fabulously Happy.

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.347
Katharine, it's really

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:28.182
not a good time
to talk.

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:30.434
You're right.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.105
Can Big Jack
come out to play?

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:36.983
Little Jack really
has to get going.

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:39.193
Little Kate has been
so lonely.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:41.112
No, no, no!

01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:42.738
Jack!

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.615
What is it?

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.285
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:50.413
- There's someone else.
- Someone else?

01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:54.375
Someone else that I have to be
meeting with

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:55.960
right now...
big deal going.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.796
Can't be in two places
at the same time.

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:00.882
Talk to you later.
Bye.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.551
Ha ha ha.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.479
[Door Closes]

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:17.857
Here we are.

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:27.533
I've got to run.
Sorry. Bye.

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:36.167
Tess, you forgot your...

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.668
[Door Closes]

01:27:39.338 --> 01:27:40.588
notebook.

01:28:00.359 --> 01:28:03.694
That... little... slut!

01:28:04.363 --> 01:28:07.031
Damn you,
bitch secretary!

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:12.495
Hi. I have a meeting
with Mr. Trask.

01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:13.746
Your name, please.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:14.997
Tess McGill.

01:28:15.082 --> 01:28:17.541
- It's at the top of the stairs.
- Thank you.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:28.844
- Miss... McGill.
- Yes.

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:29.971
Good afternoon.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:31.639
Let me take
your coat.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:34.225
Thank you.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:35.726
This way, please.

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.397
Thank you.

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:50.282
Hi.

01:28:50.367 --> 01:28:51.325
Hi.

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.493
Is everything O.K?

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:53.786
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:56.038
You're the only one
from Petty here.

01:28:56.123 --> 01:28:57.289
What's going on?

01:28:57.374 --> 01:28:59.291
I'm flying solo
on this.

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:00.793
Good.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:03.963
Armbrister and Trask
are in the corner.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:06.924
We're waiting to see
what color smoke comes out.

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:08.968
Tell me something...

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:12.179
If a colleague
of mine had a strategy,

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.265
would you look at it
if I asked?

01:29:14.808 --> 01:29:16.017
Yeah, sure.

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.643
No ethics problem?

01:29:17.728 --> 01:29:19.937
You know, open to accusations
about stealing?

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:22.314
I look at stuff
all the time.

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:24.567
Nobody's ever
accused me of stealing.

01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:25.693
What's it about?

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:29.030
Um... I don't know.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.282
I'm so nervous
I can't...

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:33.325
stand still.

01:29:34.995 --> 01:29:36.620
You'll be fine.

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.001
I love you.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:47.339
I love you, too.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:50.968
Gentlemen.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:13.824
There was a story
on the news last night

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:17.411
showing life imitating
an old children's riddle.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:21.916
It seems that a truck got stuck
at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.918
Too high
for the clearance.

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:26.837
For hours, the experts
tried to find some way

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:30.007
to unwedge the vehicle,
but to no avail.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:34.345
Finally, a 10-year-old girl
in a passing car

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:38.933
suggested letting the air
out of the truck's tires,

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:42.269
thus lowering it
to the clearance level,

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.855
which they did,
and it worked.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.482
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:49.318
By letting
some of the air

01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:52.738
out of our strategy
to expand into broadcasting,

01:30:52.823 --> 01:30:54.949
Miss McGill
and Mr. Trainer

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:58.160
have effectively shown
all of us here at Trask

01:30:58.245 --> 01:31:00.871
the light at the end
of our tunnel.

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.666
[Applause]

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:07.503
Uh, gentlemen,

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:09.130
and ladies,

01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:11.590
I've decided
to sell Mr. Trask

01:31:11.675 --> 01:31:13.134
the Metro Radio System

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:16.762
for $68.5 million
in cash and securities.

01:31:17.139 --> 01:31:20.182
Now, of course, this is
an agreement in principle.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.017
As to...
ha ha ha...

01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:24.895
what constitutes principles
in this day and age,

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:28.232
I'll leave up to you barracudas
to squabble over.

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:30.025
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

01:31:30.152 --> 01:31:32.194
[Katharine]
I'm certain they want to hear this!

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:36.031
This is a closed meeting,
and you can't...

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:38.367
Thank God
I'm here.

01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:39.577
What's going on?

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.162
You're being tricked!

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:42.705
Katharine, what...

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:45.791
Jack, just trust me
and sit down.

01:31:46.877 --> 01:31:48.252
My name
is Katharine Parker,

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:51.547
and I'm an associate partner in Mergers
and Acquisitions at Petty-Marsh,

01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:54.300
and this woman
is my secretary.

01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:56.719
She's not!

01:31:57.012 --> 01:31:58.137
Oh, no?

01:31:58.263 --> 01:31:59.263
Ask her.

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:01.515
You're not
her secretary.

01:32:01.892 --> 01:32:03.767
I can explain, Jack.

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:07.563
Jesus. You are
her secretary.

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:10.357
While I was laid up
with broken bones,

01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:11.942
she riffled
through my desk,

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:15.070
found my memo outlining
a Trask radio acquisition,

01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:17.406
and has been passing it off
as her idea.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:21.452
It was my idea.
She stole it from me, I swear.

01:32:21.745 --> 01:32:24.872
Good God, Tess, don't you know
when to stop?

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:26.582
But you're lying!

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:30.419
Oh.

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:38.886
Thank you.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:41.972
Oh, thank you.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:47.311
Ahh.

01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:49.355
Thank you all
so much.

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.859
The up side is
that I have found out

01:32:53.944 --> 01:32:55.819
in time to control
the damage.

01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:57.321
We have containment,

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.657
and we have a deal
on the table.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:03.369
I say...
pass me a set of papers.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.995
Let's get on with it.

01:33:06.623 --> 01:33:08.082
Who's running
this thing?

01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:11.502
Just... a second,
please.

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:16.173
I know you don't
believe me, but...

01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:19.718
Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:33:19.803 --> 01:33:21.011
I'm sorry.

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:23.514
I'm sorry.

01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:25.474
I'm sorry.

01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:27.017
I'm so sorry.

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:44.660
Ahem.

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.123
Ahem.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.542
Well... gentlemen,

01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:54.795
the players
may have changed

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:56.547
but the game
remains the same,

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:57.673
and the name
of the game

01:33:57.757 --> 01:33:59.383
is let's make a deal.

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:03.137
If you'll all turn to page 22
in your prospectus,

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:06.223
I'd like to take you through
the terms of transferal.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.099
[Bells Ringing]

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:56.774
Oh, hi!

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.996
Oh,
that's so nice!

01:35:11.081 --> 01:35:12.289
Bye.

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:14.416
Bye.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.753
Aah!
0hh!

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:28.389
[Horn Honks]

01:35:36.106 --> 01:35:37.481
Well, they did it.

01:35:38.525 --> 01:35:40.275
Yeah,
they sure did.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.530
You really
look... great.

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:47.032
How are you?

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:48.575
Good.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.785
Good.

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:51.954
Business is great,
and, uh...

01:35:52.038 --> 01:35:53.080
Mick,
did you see me?

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:54.498
I caught it
one-handed.

01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:57.835
Oh, hi.

01:35:58.336 --> 01:35:59.711
Hey, Doreen.

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.591
My boat's booked
through three weeks from now.

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:06.135
Doreen's
working the lines.

01:36:08.096 --> 01:36:09.346
That's great.

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:10.764
Really.

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:14.184
So how's life
in the fast lane?

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:18.021
Well, it's, um... fast.

01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:21.442
It's real fast
and busy and...

01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:24.653
It's good
to see you, Mick.

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:27.114
I guess
I better get.

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.408
It's good
to see you, too.

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:15.829
Cyn told us about
what happened.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.916
It really bites
the big one, Tess.

01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:21.210
We took up
a little collection.

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:23.420
- Thanks.
- It's not much.

01:37:23.505 --> 01:37:25.339
It's just enough
to go get toasted

01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:27.841
some night when
you really need it.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.594
Don't say no.
We really wanted to.

01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:32.971
No paying Con Ed
with it.

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:36.725
O.K., thanks.

01:37:37.393 --> 01:37:39.520
So what are you
going to do now, huh?

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:42.022
Oh, you know...
play some golf,

01:37:42.106 --> 01:37:43.774
redecorate
the country house.

01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:44.942
Ha ha ha!

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:48.445
I don't know.
Start all over.

01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:51.865
Find a job,
a place to live,

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:53.742
and just wise up

01:37:53.826 --> 01:37:56.203
and not take the whole thing
so seriously.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.539
I'll be O.K.

01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:01.875
Ahem.

01:38:03.795 --> 01:38:04.836
Bye.

01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:06.338
Bye, sweetie.

01:38:06.548 --> 01:38:08.173
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you.

01:38:08.258 --> 01:38:09.299
Thanks.

01:38:09.384 --> 01:38:10.717
So long, Tess.

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:12.302
Bye, Tess.

01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:14.763
Don't work too hard!

01:38:14.847 --> 01:38:15.973
Good-bye, Tess.

01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:28.360
Ooh!

01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:29.903
I'm sorry.

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:31.488
shit.

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:38.662
I've been trying
to find you.

01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:40.163
Just leave
me alone.

01:38:40.832 --> 01:38:42.291
Just one thing...

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:43.667
Was you and me

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.877
just part
of the scheme, too?

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:48.338
No!
Look, if I had told you

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:51.341
I was just some secretary, you
never would have taken the meeting.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:54.845
Think about it. Maybe you would
have fed me a few drinks,

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:57.556
then tried to get me
into the sack, end of story.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.682
That's not true.

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.225
Are you sure
about that?

01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:03.270
Can you honestly tell me that
it wouldn't have made a difference?

01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:05.188
Who's fooling who
here?

01:39:05.273 --> 01:39:08.066
What's this,
more stolen files?

01:39:09.027 --> 01:39:11.028
No. It's my stuff
from the desk.

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:12.321
Your stuff?

01:39:12.572 --> 01:39:13.864
Now, there's
a broad term.

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:15.449
No. It's my stuff.

01:39:15.617 --> 01:39:17.993
Maybe you can fool these guys
with this saint act,

01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:21.413
but do not ever speak to me
like we don't know what happened.

01:39:23.124 --> 01:39:25.042
Tess,
this is business.

01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:27.878
Let's just bury
the hatchet, O.K?

01:39:28.338 --> 01:39:30.130
Know where you
can bury it?

01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:32.090
Get your bony ass
out of my sight.

01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:36.386
If you think I said I loved you
as part of some scheme,

01:39:36.471 --> 01:39:37.804
that's really pathetic!

01:39:38.598 --> 01:39:40.599
My God.
She'll stop at nothing.

01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:42.726
What kind of show
are you people running?

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:45.979
I'm sorry you had to see this,
but it means nothing to us.

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:50.233
Jack, let's get upstairs.

01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:54.154
- Not without her.
- Jack.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:57.157
Trainer, are you trying
to blow this deal?

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.994
No, sir. I'm trying to make sure
that it gets done right.

01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:03.580
Tess is this team's leader.
She put this deal together.

01:40:03.665 --> 01:40:05.123
We shouldn't proceed
without her.

01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:07.000
You shouldn't
let your johnson

01:40:07.085 --> 01:40:08.752
make business
decisions for you.

01:40:09.754 --> 01:40:10.879
I'm not, sir.

01:40:10.963 --> 01:40:12.255
I'm telling you,
she's your man.

01:40:13.132 --> 01:40:14.925
What brings you
to that conclusion?

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:16.802
She said so,
and I believe her.

01:40:17.053 --> 01:40:20.013
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Are you with us or not?

01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:24.434
No.

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:27.813
Jack, I forgive you.

01:40:27.897 --> 01:40:29.898
Now get
on this elevator.

01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:33.068
Sorry, Katharine.

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:34.861
You will be sorry,
Jack.

01:40:38.157 --> 01:40:40.617
Ask her to tell you
about the hole in your deal.

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:43.412
What hole?

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:44.955
She's playing games.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:46.456
Fine. Go.

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:48.875
- No. What hole?
- Look.

01:40:50.712 --> 01:40:51.962
The people page?

01:40:52.088 --> 01:40:53.964
Now this
is ridiculous.

01:40:54.549 --> 01:40:57.884
"Former Miss America Dawn Bixby
has been house hunting here.

01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:01.680
"Seems Dawn and hot, hot,
hot DJ-hubby Slim Slicker

01:41:01.764 --> 01:41:04.558
are getting ready to take
a bite out of the Big Apple."

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:05.642
So?

01:41:05.852 --> 01:41:08.812
Slim Slicker's
one of Metro's major assets.

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:11.857
Syndicated
to all their stations.

01:41:11.941 --> 01:41:13.734
The cornerstone
of their programming.

01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:17.237
You lose him and Metro's just
O.K. real estate with falling ratings,

01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:19.322
and you're not buying it
for a write-off.

01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:21.908
Better make sure he's locked in
before they sign anything.

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.702
Oren,
I have this covered.

01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:25.203
Upstairs, shall we?

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.205
Oren!

01:41:27.331 --> 01:41:28.832
Hear the lady out,
sir.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.542
There's
another elevator.

01:41:38.176 --> 01:41:39.634
You're on.

01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:44.973
O.K.

01:41:45.433 --> 01:41:46.808
See, this is Forbes.

01:41:46.893 --> 01:41:48.143
It's just
your basic article

01:41:48.227 --> 01:41:51.021
about how you were looking
to expand into broadcasting.

01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:53.398
The same day...
I'll never forget this...

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:55.317
I'm reading page 6
of the Post.

01:41:55.401 --> 01:41:57.068
There's this item
on Bobby Stein,

01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:59.446
the radio talk show guy
who does all those gross jokes

01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:01.740
about Ethiopia
and the Betty Ford Center.

01:42:01.824 --> 01:42:04.117
He's hosting
this charity auction...

01:42:04.202 --> 01:42:05.786
real blue bloods.

01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:09.164
Now I turn the page to Susie,
who does the society stuff,

01:42:09.248 --> 01:42:10.582
and there's this picture
of your daughter.

01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:14.377
She's helping to organize
the charity ball,

01:42:14.462 --> 01:42:15.796
so I started to think,

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.590
"Trask. Radio.
Trask, radio."

01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:21.051
Then I hooked up
with Jack,

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:23.053
and he came on board
with Metro,

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:25.889
and, and...
so now, here we are.

01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:42.572
Oren, we don't have
any more time for fairy tales.

01:42:42.907 --> 01:42:45.408
Miss Parker,
let me ask you a question.

01:42:46.369 --> 01:42:47.828
How did you
come up with the idea

01:42:47.912 --> 01:42:49.579
for Trask
to buy out Metro?

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:51.957
How did I, uh...

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:55.168
Well, let's see.

01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:56.378
The, um...

01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:58.880
[Oren]
The impulse.

01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:01.091
What led you
to put the two together?

01:43:03.219 --> 01:43:05.095
I would have
to check my files.

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:07.389
I can't recall
exactly the, um...

01:43:07.765 --> 01:43:11.184
It's not as if
it was in the mainstream.

01:43:12.895 --> 01:43:15.689
You know, it would have
to be the, um...

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:20.694
Jack,
help me out here.

01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:27.325
Oren,
I beg your pardon,

01:43:28.244 --> 01:43:29.452
but if... if you
are insinuating...

01:43:29.662 --> 01:43:31.580
If I were you,

01:43:31.873 --> 01:43:35.125
I'd go to your office
and take a long, last look around.

01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:37.127
Because in five minutes,

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:38.545
I'm going to
see to it

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:40.922
that you get the boot,
but good.

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:44.551
Oren, this is a simple
misunderstanding.

01:43:44.635 --> 01:43:45.594
You cannot...

01:43:45.845 --> 01:43:47.596
I can, and I will!

01:43:47.972 --> 01:43:49.389
Now get your...

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.682
What did you
call it?

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:52.642
- Bony ass.
- Bony ass.

01:43:53.144 --> 01:43:54.227
Right.

01:43:54.312 --> 01:43:56.521
Bony ass
out of my sight.

01:43:57.481 --> 01:43:58.690
I'm sorry,

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:01.026
but I simply
won't stand

01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:02.527
for that kind
of talk.

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:07.157
Will you
excuse me, please?

01:44:17.251 --> 01:44:18.376
[Door Closes]

01:44:18.461 --> 01:44:21.004
Why didn't you tell us this
in the board room?

01:44:21.505 --> 01:44:24.132
No one was going to listen,
sir, not to me.

01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:26.801
You can bend the rules
once you get upstairs,

01:44:26.886 --> 01:44:28.345
but not while you're
trying to get there.

01:44:28.429 --> 01:44:31.598
And if you're like me, you can't
get there without bending the rules.

01:44:32.016 --> 01:44:33.808
You've got fire
in your belly.

01:44:34.185 --> 01:44:36.561
Or was this a one-time stunt
that you pulled?

01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:39.230
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:42.067
I have something in my belly,
but I think it's nervous knots.

01:44:42.777 --> 01:44:44.945
Are you willing to go
out on that limb every day,

01:44:45.029 --> 01:44:46.863
working for me,
legitimately?

01:44:47.865 --> 01:44:48.949
Yes, sir.

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:50.241
Have to be right
at the entry level.

01:44:50.326 --> 01:44:51.451
Have any problem
with that?

01:44:51.535 --> 01:44:52.619
No, sir.

01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:54.704
Gumption, Miss McGill.

01:44:55.039 --> 01:44:56.164
Yes, sir.

01:44:56.374 --> 01:44:57.457
See you tomorrow.

01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:58.541
O.K.

01:44:59.085 --> 01:45:00.335
Trainer. Dwayne.

01:45:00.419 --> 01:45:01.586
Let's go back
to my office

01:45:01.671 --> 01:45:03.672
and see about this
Slim what's his name's contract.

01:45:03.756 --> 01:45:05.215
Be right
with you, sir.

01:45:10.513 --> 01:45:12.222
- Aww.
- Aww.

01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:14.474
Way to go, Tess.
Way to go.

01:45:14.558 --> 01:45:15.475
Beauty!

01:45:41.419 --> 01:45:42.752
For you.

01:45:43.421 --> 01:45:44.462
You like it?

01:45:44.588 --> 01:45:46.006
Ha ha ha!

01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:49.718
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

01:45:51.012 --> 01:45:52.595
Milk money.

01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:54.889
Twinkies.

01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:57.434
Pen, pencil, ruler.

01:45:57.518 --> 01:45:59.060
Apple
for the teacher.

01:45:59.437 --> 01:46:01.229
Now, remember...

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.273
Play nice
with the other kids.

01:46:04.025 --> 01:46:05.859
Make sure you're home
before dark.

01:46:19.415 --> 01:46:20.832
Hi. Tess McGill.

01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:21.916
Good morning.

01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:23.001
Good morning.

01:46:23.085 --> 01:46:24.711
The director's
out sick today.

01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:26.796
She'll see you
first thing tomorrow.

01:46:28.007 --> 01:46:29.966
Miss Baxter's
already up there.

01:46:30.634 --> 01:46:32.385
She'll show you
the layout.

01:46:32.845 --> 01:46:34.804
It's at the end
of the hall.

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:36.306
Thank you.

01:46:36.515 --> 01:46:37.891
You're welcome.

01:46:47.985 --> 01:46:50.403
Anybody will be an improvement
over that terrorist.

01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:53.698
I mean...
something semihuman.

01:47:04.418 --> 01:47:05.460
Oh.

01:47:05.878 --> 01:47:07.504
I didn't
hear you come in.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:09.714
I'm Alice Baxter.

01:47:09.799 --> 01:47:11.299
Tess McGill.

01:47:11.675 --> 01:47:14.219
I was just...
using the phone.

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.680
Yes, well...
that happens.

01:47:18.557 --> 01:47:19.849
How about
some coffee?

01:47:20.059 --> 01:47:21.518
Sure,
just tell me where.

01:47:21.894 --> 01:47:23.353
No. I'll get it.

01:47:23.854 --> 01:47:25.021
Oh. How?

01:47:25.356 --> 01:47:27.023
Milk and sugar, please.

01:47:27.316 --> 01:47:28.566
Thank you.

01:47:49.338 --> 01:47:52.048
Uh... Miss McGill?

01:47:52.133 --> 01:47:53.216
Yes?

01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:55.009
That's your desk...

01:47:56.137 --> 01:47:57.303
in there.

01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:59.180
I don't think so.

01:47:59.765 --> 01:48:02.392
Oh, yes.
I sit out here.

01:48:03.102 --> 01:48:04.102
I'm sorry.

01:48:04.186 --> 01:48:05.145
I thought
the secretary

01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:06.271
would sit out here.

01:48:07.148 --> 01:48:08.314
That's right.

01:48:08.399 --> 01:48:09.899
I'm the secretary.

01:48:11.402 --> 01:48:13.528
If it's O.K.,
I prefer "assistant."

01:48:29.712 --> 01:48:33.173
You've got a 10:00 meeting
with Slater,

01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:35.800
11:00 with Donahue
from Logistics...

01:48:35.885 --> 01:48:37.510
his office on 23...

01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:39.012
and lunch
with Mr. Trask,

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.014
his office downtown,
1:00.

01:48:42.516 --> 01:48:44.267
It's all right there
in the computer.

01:48:44.351 --> 01:48:46.895
Just hit shift "S"
for your schedule.

01:48:54.111 --> 01:48:56.779
Um... When I saw you

01:48:57.573 --> 01:49:00.575
in here on the phone
with your feet up,

01:49:00.784 --> 01:49:03.036
I figured this
was your office.

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:06.748
I'm sorry about that,
Miss McGill.

01:49:06.957 --> 01:49:09.042
It won't happen
again... ever.

01:49:09.126 --> 01:49:10.543
It's O.K.

01:49:12.129 --> 01:49:13.588
Maybe now would
be a good time

01:49:13.672 --> 01:49:15.340
to go over what you
expect of me.

01:49:17.968 --> 01:49:18.968
Uh...

01:49:19.053 --> 01:49:20.303
Ahem.

01:49:21.347 --> 01:49:24.807
I, uh, I expect you
to call me Tess.

01:49:25.351 --> 01:49:27.143
I don't expect you
to fetch me coffee

01:49:27.228 --> 01:49:29.520
unless you're getting
some for yourself,

01:49:29.605 --> 01:49:30.939
and, um...

01:49:32.233 --> 01:49:35.777
the rest we'll just
make up as we go along.

01:49:36.862 --> 01:49:37.987
O.K?

01:49:41.325 --> 01:49:42.492
O.K.

01:49:44.745 --> 01:49:47.705
I'll be right outside
if you need anything.

01:49:48.165 --> 01:49:49.499
Fine.

01:50:01.345 --> 01:50:02.595
Cyn.

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:05.139
Guess where I am.

01:50:05.266 --> 01:50:06.683
Ha ha!

01:50:08.686 --> 01:50:12.522
Let the river run

01:50:12.856 --> 01:50:19.028
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation

01:50:19.196 --> 01:50:27.537
Come the New Jerusalem

01:50:29.873 --> 01:50:34.085
Silver cities rise

01:50:34.169 --> 01:50:36.796
The morning lights

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:40.049
The streets
that lead them

01:50:40.134 --> 01:50:42.302
And sirens

01:50:42.386 --> 01:50:44.304
Call them on

01:50:44.388 --> 01:50:48.349
With a song

01:50:50.769 --> 01:50:54.522
It's asking
for the taking

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:01.696
Trembling, shaking

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:06.409
Oh, my heart is aching

01:51:06.702 --> 01:51:07.952
We're coming to the edge

01:51:08.037 --> 01:51:09.620
Running on the water

01:51:09.747 --> 01:51:12.749
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

01:51:12.833 --> 01:51:16.502
We, the great and small

01:51:16.587 --> 01:51:19.297
Stand on a star

01:51:19.381 --> 01:51:24.761
And blaze a trail
of desire

01:51:24.928 --> 01:51:31.768
Through the darkening dawn

01:51:33.145 --> 01:51:38.274
It's asking
for the taking

01:51:38.442 --> 01:51:39.942
Come run with me now

01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:41.861
The sky is the color
of blue

01:51:41.945 --> 01:51:44.489
You've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover

01:51:44.573 --> 01:51:49.077
Oh, my heart is aching

01:51:49.161 --> 01:51:50.411
We're coming
to the edge

01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:52.163
Running on the water

01:51:52.247 --> 01:51:55.083
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

01:52:15.687 --> 01:52:21.275
It's asking
for the taking

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:26.572
Trembling, shaking

01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:31.577
Oh, my heart is aching

01:52:31.662 --> 01:52:32.912
We're coming to the edge

01:52:32.996 --> 01:52:34.580
Running on the water

01:52:34.665 --> 01:52:37.291
Coming through the fog,
your sons and daughters

01:52:37.376 --> 01:52:39.961
Let the river run

01:52:40.045 --> 01:52:41.712
Let the river run

01:52:41.797 --> 01:52:43.756
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation

01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:47.844
Let all the dreamers
wake the nation

01:52:47.928 --> 01:52:57.854
Come the New Jerusalem
