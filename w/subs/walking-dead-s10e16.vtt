over here.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.825
I may have taken a shot
to the noggin,

04:43.951 --> 04:45.327
but I'm still capable

04:45.452 --> 04:46.495
of running calculations
and estimates.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.996
And the ticks
it would take

04:48.121 --> 04:50.249
to execute necessary repairs
and vamoose

04:50.374 --> 04:52.209
is simply too great

something out.

slowing the passage of time,

you did not waver,

That we gave it
everything we had.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.115
that Stephanie will not stay
past sundown tomorrow.

She say that to you?
Then you don't know.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.078

I'd never see people again,

06:51.203 --> 06:53.830

look at me now.

-I am.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.523
If they're like us,
I get it.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.568
DARYL: I just wish
she would've told me.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.945
I'd've gone with her.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.616
Only way
she would go anywhere

07:29.741 --> 07:31.493
is knowing
you were here.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.579
For Judith and RJ.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.330
Everyone.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.374
Just keep thinking
I'm never gonna see her again.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.542
Just like everyone else.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.677
I'm still here.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.972
GABRIEL: Our plan is the same.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.807
We lead the horde away,

07:53.932 --> 07:56.518
just not from Oceanside
as we had planned.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.645
Once the walkers
are clear,

07:58.770 --> 08:00.814
we evacuate
to Rendezvous Point B.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.567
Luke. We ready?

08:03.692 --> 08:06.612
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, technically.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.448
Okay.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.992
So, these are
the final pieces

08:12.117 --> 08:15.162
that we need to connect
to the wagon.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.165
But in order for it to do
the pied piper thing

08:18.290 --> 08:19.958
that we need it to do
over the cliff,

08:20.083 --> 08:23.629
we gotta get from A to B,
and I gotta plug and plug,

08:23.754 --> 08:26.590
and then
we should be good to go.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.218
That wagon is on the other side
of the horde.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.719
So...
someone's gotta go through it?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.012
With skins in there?

08:32.137 --> 08:33.555
GABRIEL: Four groups.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.723
Two in each.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.517
One carries the cargo,
one protects.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.977
It's crucial
that all the equipment

08:39.102 --> 08:40.229
makes it to the wagon.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.939
LYDIA: We can make it through.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.816
I'll help.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.945
We're willing.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.364
But not if she goes.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.618
And we know she's earned trust
with you, but...

08:54.743 --> 08:56.161
Oceanside isn't ready.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.955
-Not with this.
-That's fine.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.582
As it happens,
Lydia's role is in here.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.879
Look, we're not all gonna
make it through.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.298
But this
is the only way.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.635
If Daryl's going,
then so am I.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.899
Negan helped them
attack Hilltop.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.526
That couldn't have
happened--

09:27.651 --> 09:28.694

09:28.819 --> 09:31.196
And I'm sorry
about that.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.301
LYDIA: Need help?

09:54.052 --> 09:56.763
I've got it.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.933
Okay.

10:02.561 --> 10:05.063
If you're avoiding me,
please stop.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.776
I don't hate you
for what you did.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.742
You should.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.745
Didn't fix anything.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.622
LYDIA: It did for me.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.292
A little, at least.

10:26.877 --> 10:30.047
I know
that sounds awful, but...

10:30.172 --> 10:33.383
She was never really
my mother.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.512
Not in the way
that matters.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.724

if we can still talk.

to be yourself.

to find your own way.
