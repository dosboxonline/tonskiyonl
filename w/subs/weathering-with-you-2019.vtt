00:54.137 --> 00:57.842
This is a story
only she and I know about.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.051
The story of the secret
of this world.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.678
It was like a pool of light.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.141
She ran out of the hospital.

02:35.739 --> 02:38.314
Praying with all her heart,

02:38.992 --> 02:41.407
she crossed the shrine gate.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.385
Fish?

03:17.447 --> 03:23.234
Now I wonder if what I saw that day
was just a dream.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.238
But it wasnt

03:27.916 --> 03:31.745
that summer aay, up in the sky,

03:32.754 --> 03:36.459
we changed the shape
of the world.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.774
I'm a 16-year-old
high school student

04:07.038 --> 04:10.788
we re expecting
very heavy rain shortly.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.870
It's gonna rain again.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.785
I thought it had finally cleared.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.713
We ran into a typhoon
on the island too.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.130
Excuse me.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.421
Sorry.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.550
For your safety,
please go back inside.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.901
Here it comes.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.912
Wow!

05:28.161 --> 05:29.826
Thank you.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.156
What a storm it was.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.415

a well-paid part-time job

05:40.423 --> 05:42.783

05:45.178 --> 05:47.548
Yeah. I'm not hungry.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.839
Really? Thanks for treating me.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.884
Don't mention it. You saved me.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.974
Yeah. That was close.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.812
Oh. Right.

06:02.988 --> 06:08.198
It's the first time
I saved someone's life.

06:08.869 --> 06:09.869
Ok.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.619
By the way,
do they sell beer here?

06:14.332 --> 06:15.572
Shall I get you one?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.334
It's so expensive!

06:20.589 --> 06:22.830
A grown-up man
scrounging on me...

06:23.633 --> 06:25.874
Tokyo is scary.

06:33.435 --> 06:37.806
Where can I get one
without student ID?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.350
Question posted

06:42.694 --> 06:44.313
it's raining again.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.156
Why did you come to Tokyo?

06:51.286 --> 06:53.861
Er... to visit a relative.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.239
Summer vacation
starts early at my school.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.375
Hmm.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.710
If you ever need help,

07:03.089 --> 07:04.872
See ya, kid.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.302

07:25.278 --> 07:26.313

07:27.489 --> 07:29.730
It suddenly started
pouring down again...

07:29.866 --> 07:33.695
Don't you ever learn?
It's a pain to clean up.

07:33.828 --> 07:34.908
Sorry.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.371
Last years record instances

07:38.500 --> 07:40.073
part-time jobs of sudden torrential
rain were largely exceeded this year...

07:40.085 --> 07:40.198
Of sudden torrential rain were
largely exceeded this year...

07:40.210 --> 07:41.416
0 results of sudden torrential rain
were largely exceeded this year...

07:41.419 --> 07:43.779
Of sudden torrential rain were
largely exceeded this year...

07:46.007 --> 07:47.007
4 answers great!

07:48.510 --> 07:49.510
No such job

07:49.636 --> 07:50.921

07:53.014 --> 07:54.888
sex club waiter

07:55.016 --> 07:56.016
really?

07:56.518 --> 07:57.518
Huh?

07:57.644 --> 07:58.724
Are you really in college?

07:58.853 --> 07:59.888
Where's your ID?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.021
Forget it.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.395
It's not stuff for kids.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.937
Suadaen downpours expected...

08:09.322 --> 08:11.529
Tokyo is scary.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.946
Living in Tokyo! Expenses

08:20.250 --> 08:22.915
I've got to start saving.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.953
Shinjuku station

08:33.054 --> 08:34.881

- Master.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.464
Hey, mister. Wait a minute.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.020
18 guns, 1600 live ammunition found
everything the solicitors say is a lie.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.983
Hey, you.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.816
What are you doing here?
Are you a minor?

08:53.825 --> 08:55.399
- Hey!
- Wait!

08:55.577 --> 08:56.945
You jerk!

09:18.933 --> 09:20.841
Tokyo is scary.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.735
But...

09:34.282 --> 09:36.777
I don't want to go home.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.650
Never again.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.284
- Who's this?
- Is he sleeping?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.497
On the floor?

09:45.627 --> 09:48.121
Hey, are you a customer?

09:48.254 --> 09:49.460
No, sorry.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.878
Is he ok?

09:55.011 --> 09:56.758
I eave him alone.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.756
- Get out of the way.
- Sorry.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.239
It's gotta be a toy.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.626
Yamabukicho

10:29.003 --> 10:31.039
21 minutes

11:23.141 --> 11:24.347
Fr... what's this?

11:24.475 --> 11:25.755
It's for you. Don't tell anyone.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.517
Huh? But, why?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.102
You've eaten that for dinner
three nights in a row.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.823
I think that was

11:43.411 --> 11:47.954
the most delicious dinner I've had
in all 16 years of my life.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.466
When can we meet again?

12:00.595 --> 12:02.593
How about the day
after tomorrow?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.884
Great! I found a nice café.
I'll book a table.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.637
See you, nagi.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.517
Bye, ayane.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.644
A grade schooler...

12:15.860 --> 12:18.897
How lucky.
I was hoping to see you.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.862
- Hi, kana.
- Hello, nagi.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.071
He's a ladles' man.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.820
- Did you curl your hair?
- Yes! What do you think?

12:25.954 --> 12:28.403
You look great. Very lovely.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.990
Tokyo's amazing.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.167
K&a planning

12:35.171 --> 12:35.910
k&a planning it should be here.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.207
It should be here.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.723
It doesn't work.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.819
Excuse me. I'm morishima.
I called earlier.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.234
Mr. suga, are you in?

13:06.160 --> 13:08.241
Mr. suga?

13:11.582 --> 13:14.248
Mr. suga?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.130
Wait, this isn't right.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.513
Hello.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.341
Sorry, I'm...

13:28.474 --> 13:31.716
The new assistant. Kei told me.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.266
Huh? No, I haven't yet...

13:33.396 --> 13:35.682
I'm natsumi. Nice to meet you.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.436
Finally, someone else
to do the grunt work!

13:44.032 --> 13:45.272
Hey, kid.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.575
Yes?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.277
You looked at my boobs.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.413
I didn't.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.494
What's your name?

13:55.626 --> 13:56.786
Hodaka morishima.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.126
Hodaka. Beautiful name.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.587
Are you employed here, natsumi?

14:01.716 --> 14:03.714
Wanna know about me and kei?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.050
- Um, yes.
- You're so funny.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.303
It's like you think.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.015
Really?

14:13.269 --> 14:15.810
I've never seen
a mistress before.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.311
Long time no see, kid.
Have you lost weight?

14:23.071 --> 14:25.736
Don't tell me you went
out gambling again.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.242
You're looking for a job, right?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.192
This is what we're
working on now.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.910
We write for time-honored
and prestigious magazines.

14:36.918 --> 14:37.918
The man who came

14:38.294 --> 14:39.579
downpours are weather weapons

14:39.837 --> 14:41.317
many human sacrifices
protecting Tokyo

14:41.381 --> 14:43.622
our next feature is
"urban legends."

14:43.758 --> 14:47.633
Go and interview people
who witnessed or experienced some.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.337
- Huh? But, I...
- Any topic will do.

14:50.473 --> 14:55.637
Disappearances, human traffic, etc.
You kids like that kinda stuff, right?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.055
How about this?

14:57.188 --> 15:00.096
100% sunshine girl "the girl who
brings sunshine wherever she goes."

15:00.233 --> 15:02.269
- "Sunshine girl"?
- I'm like that!

15:02.402 --> 15:04.438
It's raining so much this year.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.236
- He ignored me?
- There's a demand for that.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.365
Right.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.073
Come on, kid.
You've got zero initiative.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.444
She's got an interview appointment.
Go along and listen.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.120
Me? Now?!

15:16.582 --> 15:18.618
- You're on probation!
- "Probatory period.”

15:19.127 --> 15:21.910
No, really. I can't.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.625
Of course,
sunshine girls do exist.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.758
I knew it!

15:26.926 --> 15:29.087
And also rain girls.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.050
Fortune teller

15:30.054 --> 15:35.632
fortune teller the first are possessed by
a fox god. The latter by a dragon god.

15:35.935 --> 15:36.970
Fxcuse me?

15:37.103 --> 15:41.646
Dragon god individuals drink a lot.
They yearn for water.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.392
They're strong-willed and competitive,
but a bit careless and unreliable.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.401
Maybe that's me.

15:47.613 --> 15:52.281
Fox god individuals are hardworking,
but too weak-hearted to be leaders.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.410
Many are beautiful.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.494
Definitely me.

15:54.829 --> 15:59.739
The weather's off-balance, so more
sunshine and rain girls are born now.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.415
Homeostasis of gaia theory.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.544
I see.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.914
But, we must be careful.

16:05.256 --> 16:09.131
Messing with nature
always has a cost.

16:09.260 --> 16:13.135
Whoever uses too much weather power
gets spirited away.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.264
That's...

16:15.516 --> 16:17.344
I'll be careful.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.184
So, how was it?

16:22.064 --> 16:27.020
A so-called psychic talked at length
about fantasy novel-like stuff.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.913
"If you use too much power
you'll disappear.”

16:28.988 --> 16:30.402
I see. That kinda stuff.

16:30.531 --> 16:35.317
Weather isn't some kind of “power.”
it's a natural phenomenon.

16:35.453 --> 16:40.537
Look, we're aware of that.
But, we're providing entertainment.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.249
Is that all you've written so far?
You're slow.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.082
Sorry.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.211
But it's not bad.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.714
All right, you're hired.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.716
Wait a minute!
I didn't say I was...

16:51.844 --> 16:53.213
It's a live-in job.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.178
- Meals included.
- Really?

16:56.307 --> 16:57.721
I'll do it! Please hire me.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.887
Good. What's your name again?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.226
- Huh?
- Droll.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.220
- It's hodaka.
- Right.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.523
It's ready.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.067
Here.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.686
I'm underage, remember?

17:10.112 --> 17:12.732
Let's celebrate hodaka's hiring.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.773
Cheers!

17:19.079 --> 17:23.242
That was the first meal I shared
with someone since I came fo Tokyo.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.247
This is when my new life started.

17:40.142 --> 17:44.305
On that aay, the wind suddenly
changed before our eyes

17:44.438 --> 17:48.059
thats when I knew
I could do most anything,

17:48.192 --> 17:52.275
lke break the world record

17:52.405 --> 17:56.693
with my weaker hand

17:56.826 --> 17:57.190
I did, I really did

17:57.201 --> 17:58.615
I did, I really did
the power of 100 basket clams!

17:58.619 --> 18:00.735
I did, I really did

18:01.080 --> 18:05.243
it was a small editing company,
run by Mr. suga and natsumi.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.870
I did all the office chores.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.582
Starting from Mr. suga s
personal care...

18:10.715 --> 18:14.130
Answering the phone, filing receiprs,
franscribing interviews.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.877
Is that all you've written so far?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.803
This isn't mine.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.639
Mr. suga's out of the office...

18:23.769 --> 18:28.771
Sometimes I rode around fown
with natsum/ fo do some /nferviews.

18:30.151 --> 18:33.566
If the world can easily
be changed by love

18:34.196 --> 18:37.196
noboay even cares fo laugh

18:37.325 --> 18:38.235
whats the use of such a world?
I don't need it not for me

18:38.242 --> 18:39.448
whats the use of such a world? I don't
need it not for me a middle schooler?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.471
Whats the use of such a world?
I don't need it not for me

18:41.495 --> 18:45.245
god, please show me
the next one now

18:45.374 --> 18:48.582
- they're looking for a sunshine girl.
- Hilarious.

18:48.961 --> 18:53.712
My sis' friend's a real sunshine girl.
She calls her the day before a date...

18:53.841 --> 18:55.748
Weather research lab
we're not interested.

18:55.926 --> 18:59.964
Then the weather balloon's videosonde
picked up something strange.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.006
A swarm of moving objects
among the cumulonimbi.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.009
Is that all you've written?

19:06.187 --> 19:07.867
You have to buy these
when they're on sale.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.265
He's out of the office...

19:09.482 --> 19:12.230
This paragraph's crap.
But this ain't bad.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.025
Pachinko

19:15.404 --> 19:17.854
Mr. suga, wake up. Come on.

19:17.865 --> 19:18.524
Hello with no goodbye, future with no
resignation Mr. suga, wake up. Come on.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.694
Hello with no goodbye,
future with no resignation

19:21.869 --> 19:23.443
heart with many doors
without any keys

19:23.454 --> 19:25.390
heart with many doors without
any keys my days were hectic.

19:25.414 --> 19:25.869
But, for the first time
someone was relying on me.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.206
I don't mind if the future looks at us as if it knew
but, for the first time someone was relying on me.

19:29.210 --> 19:29.744
I don't mind if the future
looks af us as if it knew

19:29.919 --> 19:33.334
there is much more we can do those
rainy days in Tokyo passed in a flash.

19:33.339 --> 19:33.543
Those rainy days in Tokyo
passed in a flash.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.081
We got plenty of miracles, why don't we use them
those rainy days in Tokyo passed in a flash.

19:34.090 --> 19:38.966
We got plenty of miracles,
why don't we use them

19:50.856 --> 19:51.856
Rain.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.566
Rain. Rain. Rain.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.814
There you are.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.356
How's it going, rain?

20:01.951 --> 20:04.067
Yeah? Good boy.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.951
It's an easy job. You'll see.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.084
But...

20:13.170 --> 20:16.586
Just give it a try.
You'll get paid right away.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.922
Our club is right there.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.259
That girl...

20:27.351 --> 20:31.180
Give it a go
and earn yourself some bucks.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.190
It's right there. Let's go!

20:38.821 --> 20:39.981
But...

20:50.583 --> 20:51.743
Let's go.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.335
Hey! Wait a minute.

21:02.219 --> 21:02.958
Wait!

21:03.095 --> 21:06.004
- Just keep running!
- Listen to me.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.551
You brat!

21:13.272 --> 21:16.055
Hey, man.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.857
What do you think you're doing?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.776
You were forcing her.

21:22.323 --> 21:26.072
Are you dumb or what?
We've made a deal.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.820
Don't tell me...

21:31.582 --> 21:35.331
You're the brat that was
squatting in front of our club?

21:35.503 --> 21:38.331
What's this, payback?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.333
Please stop it.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.002
Damn!

21:44.136 --> 21:45.342
Get off me!

21:47.932 --> 21:49.839
What's that? A toy gun?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.345
You really are dumb.

22:16.919 --> 22:17.954
Get up.

22:42.653 --> 22:43.733
You...

22:44.864 --> 22:48.234
What was that for?
To thank me for that burger?

22:49.326 --> 22:52.235
Where did you get that gun?
Who are you?

22:52.413 --> 22:53.744
That's...

22:53.873 --> 22:58.289
I found it. I thought it was a toy.
It was like a lucky charm for me.

22:58.586 --> 23:03.253
What? You pointed it at someone.
You could have killed him.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.920
I can't believe it! You make me sick.
You're the worst.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.963
I got fired from
my part-time job.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.673
Was it my fault?

23:47.801 --> 23:50.505
No, nothing to do with that burger.

23:50.638 --> 23:55.009
But, that's why
I need a well-paid job.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.970
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

24:04.735 --> 24:07.150
- Does it hurt?
- Not really.

24:09.281 --> 24:13.282
You're a runaway, aren't you?
I can tell.

24:13.494 --> 24:16.702
But, you can't enjoy Tokyo
with this rain.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.658
Huh? Yeah.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.660
Come with me.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.935
It'll clear up now.

24:42.064 --> 24:43.064
Huh?

24:55.452 --> 24:57.693
What do you mean?

25:13.303 --> 25:14.303
A sunshine girl?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.262
I'm hina.

25:18.392 --> 25:19.841
- What's your name?
- Hodaka.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.138
- How old are you?
- 16.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.894
Younger than me.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.978
T'll be 18 next month.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.730
You don't look it.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.736
You should treat me
with respect.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.204
Pleased to meet you, hodaka.

25:43.709 --> 25:44.709
Me too.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.665
Mom, there's a fish.

26:34.802 --> 26:35.802
Yeah? Nice.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.469
Don't say bullshit.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.885
I'm serious. This way.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.348
I ook. Over there.

26:48.732 --> 26:49.732
Can't see anything.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.482
It's there. Look harder.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.539
What's that?

27:23.267 --> 27:29.352
The kanto region is experiencing
record-breaking rainfall this summer.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.977
It's been raining continuously
for two months.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.105
The 30 days forecast predicts
more heavy rain for another month.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.320
Sunshine for you the 30 days forecast
predicts more heavy rain for another month.

27:38.323 --> 27:38.561
Sunshine for you

27:38.574 --> 27:39.029
sunshine for you the meteorological agency
said it's an extremely exceptional...

27:39.032 --> 27:41.816
The meteorological agency sald
it's an extremely exceptional...

27:46.456 --> 27:48.537
Too expensive?

27:48.667 --> 27:49.497
Hey!

27:49.626 --> 27:52.121
Look, it's amazing.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.629
Some stuff fell down
with the rain

27:55.757 --> 27:57.126
in the parking lot

27:57.259 --> 27:58.628
fafrotskies

27:58.760 --> 28:01.046
see-through like jelly

28:01.430 --> 28:06.215
they kinda look like fish.
They fell from the sky?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.846
But, they left no trace...

28:08.979 --> 28:10.473
They instantly disappear.

28:10.606 --> 28:11.606
I ook.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.314
Remember what the guy
we interviewed said?

28:18.447 --> 28:21.564
The sky's a deeper
unknown world than the sea.

28:22.576 --> 28:25.909
A cumulonimbus can hold
as much water as a whole lake.

28:26.038 --> 28:29.658
So, it could as well harbor
an uncharted ecosystem.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.699
I ike these fish?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.167
I guess. Amazing, isn't it?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.082
If we write about it...

28:36.715 --> 28:38.084
Maybe we can make good money.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.675
Huh? What?

28:40.510 --> 28:44.798
You're starting to sound like kei.
You'll be a boring grown-up.

28:45.015 --> 28:48.014
Don't put off
your sunshine girl.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.475
- You're going on a date, right?
- It's not a date...

28:50.604 --> 28:52.602
I'm going to look for a job.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.604
What? Don't you work here?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.102
I'm just hanging out.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.273
It's not a date, I said.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.118
I understand how you feel,
keisuke.

29:08.747 --> 29:12.622
But, she finally stopped
talking about you.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.122
It'd be cruel to meet her now.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.087
But, I have the right to see her.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.631
Besides, you smoke. Don't you?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.178
Huh?

29:24.221 --> 29:26.128
She's got asthma.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.130
You're too inconsiderate.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.600
I quit smoking a while ago.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.142
But...

29:33.480 --> 29:36.055
You give a bad impression.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.862
It's raining all the time
this year.

29:48.078 --> 29:51.160
She can't play outside,
and it's bad for her asthma.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.408
I feel sorry
for children nowadays.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.918
We used fo have
beautiful Springs and summers.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.683
They can't live together
just the two of them.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.514
You're right.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.195
Hold on.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.363
So, possibly...

30:27.284 --> 30:30.237
I'm visiting a girl's home

30:30.912 --> 30:33.153
for the first time!

30:34.374 --> 30:36.455
Welcome, hodaka.
You got lost, didn't you?

30:36.752 --> 30:39.535
No, er... it's not much, but...

30:39.671 --> 30:43.042
Wow, thank you. Come on in.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.548
- Thank you.
- Sure.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.006
Potato chips

30:49.139 --> 30:49.924
instant noodles

30:50.057 --> 30:51.759
did you have lunch?

30:51.892 --> 30:54.466
Not yet. But, it's ok.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.475
Sit there and relax.

30:56.897 --> 30:57.977
Can I use these?

30:58.315 --> 31:00.431
- Sure.
- Thanks.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.495
Do you live alone?

31:16.249 --> 31:18.998
With my younger brother.
We had some problems.

31:19.628 --> 31:20.913
Problems?

31:21.505 --> 31:24.045
How about you?
Why did you run away?

31:25.550 --> 31:28.000
I found it suffocating
to live with my parents.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.010
And in that town.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.098
I see.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.518
Shouldn't you go back?

31:44.277 --> 31:45.517
I don't want to.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.603
Right.

31:49.533 --> 31:50.533
Here you go.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.535
I forgot the spring onions!

31:58.708 --> 32:00.536
How do you like living in Tokyo?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.535
Fr... oh.

32:02.712 --> 32:03.712
Come to think of it,

32:03.839 --> 32:06.125
I don't feel like
I'm suffocating anymore.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.040
Happy to hear that.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.049
I et's eat.

32:19.729 --> 32:20.729
What? An earthquake?

32:22.858 --> 32:23.973
It's the train.

32:27.863 --> 32:28.648
Are you serious, hodaka?

32:28.655 --> 32:29.815
Sunshine for you
are you serious, hodaka?

32:29.823 --> 32:29.936
Sunshine for you

32:29.948 --> 32:31.063
sunshine for you well, you're a
real sunshine girl, aren't you?

32:31.074 --> 32:33.155
Well, you're a real
sunshine girl, aren't you?

32:33.493 --> 32:35.574
You can clear up the sky
just by praying.

32:35.704 --> 32:36.704
Yeah.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.995
Don't you need a job?

32:39.124 --> 32:42.077
I do.
But, I can't charge people for that.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.707
I don't think you're cut out for
working in a club like that.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.209
Hodaka.

32:49.593 --> 32:50.833
What are you looking at?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.089
I'm not looking at anything.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.345
Sorry.

32:54.806 --> 32:55.806
Isn't $50 too expensive?

32:57.642 --> 33:00.012
Shall we do $30, then?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.602
Considering living
expenses, though...

33:03.732 --> 33:05.271
Maybe we need some graphics.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.940
I'll draw them.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.943
What's this? A hippo?

33:10.071 --> 33:12.441
- It's a frog.
- Seriously?

33:14.201 --> 33:15.065
It's done!

33:15.202 --> 33:15.861
Sunshine for you

33:15.869 --> 33:17.238
sunshine for you I'll upload it.

33:17.245 --> 33:17.358
Sunshine for you

33:17.370 --> 33:18.784
sunshine for you - ok? - Yeah.

33:18.788 --> 33:19.152
Sunshine for you

33:19.164 --> 33:20.364
sunshine for you hi, I'm home.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.282
I'd like some sardines...

33:25.045 --> 33:25.875
Who are you?

33:26.004 --> 33:29.121
You're the boy on the bus!

33:29.841 --> 33:31.255
Do you know each other?

33:31.384 --> 33:33.500
Hodaka, this is my brother nagi.

33:33.637 --> 33:37.087
Nagi, this is hodaka.
He's my business partner.

33:37.224 --> 33:38.224
Request

33:38.308 --> 33:40.055
we've got a request!

33:40.185 --> 33:41.599
You've already uploaded it?

33:41.728 --> 33:44.970
They want good weather
for a flea market.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.141
It's tomorrow.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.103
Wait a minute!
Am I really gonna do this?

33:49.236 --> 33:50.938
Widespread rain tomorrow...

33:51.071 --> 33:52.484
It's gonna rain tomorrow.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.154
That's the whole point.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.065
Who the hell is that guy?

33:56.201 --> 33:58.282
It'll be fine. I'll help you.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.905
How?!

34:03.291 --> 34:05.407
Please use this.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.216
Sorry, I won't.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.167
I've got another
secret weapon for you.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.514
Sorry, don't need it.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.728
Cut it out, hodaka!

34:29.650 --> 34:32.226
Who called those weirdos?

34:32.362 --> 34:35.524
We thought it might
bring good luck.

34:40.495 --> 34:43.612
Don't push yourselves too hard.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.829
We're almost there!

34:45.958 --> 34:47.244
Water, hina?

34:47.377 --> 34:48.708
Do you want a candy?

34:49.795 --> 34:51.956
- Tell them to go home.
- Ok.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.206
- The sky's clearing up.
- No way!

35:05.770 --> 35:08.220
- It cleared up.
- It's been ages, huh?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.726
- Look! Look!
- Finally, after so long.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.229
- The sky's so beautiful.
- Amazing.

35:14.779 --> 35:15.779
What do you think?

35:16.031 --> 35:19.193
- You're awesome, guys.
- You're a real sunshine girl.

35:19.326 --> 35:22.234
- I'm so surprised.
- You're great.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.240
- Even if it was a coincidence.
- It wasn't.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.247
Here's $200.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.375
It's too much.

35:28.418 --> 35:31.166
You get a bonus
because you're cute.

35:31.296 --> 35:35.748
Thank you so much.
We'll sell a lot more now.

35:44.684 --> 35:45.764
Yaay!

35:46.311 --> 35:48.427

38:09.496 --> 38:12.578
We re really influenced
by the weather.

38:13.208 --> 38:18.084
I realized how much the human heart
is connected with the sky.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.037
There's miso soup in the pot. H.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.549
I'm off.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.762

38:35.855 --> 38:38.430

shall we go home?

38:43.321 --> 38:44.961
Let's make a good weather
charm I'm tired.

38:45.990 --> 38:50.442
I've read online that
the "100% sunshine girl" is amazing.

38:50.578 --> 38:55.822
But, this is such a big event.
Do you really want to rely on that?

38:55.959 --> 39:00.455
It's going to rain all week.
We won't be able to postpone it.

39:00.755 --> 39:05.089
In this situation, we're even
ready to rely on a charm.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.050
The jingu galen fireworks

39:54.183 --> 39:57.345
will start at 7 P.M.
as scheauled.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.638
I'm in love.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.643
With this sunshine girl job.

40:41.314 --> 40:45.143
I finally found my role in life.

40:45.902 --> 40:50.569
Maybe. Or maybe not.
Or maybe not not.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.482
Maybe not not...?

40:53.618 --> 40:54.778
Yes or ho?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.906
You're too serious.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.743
Thank you, hodaka.

41:07.548 --> 41:10.168
Weather is a mystery.

41:10.551 --> 41:14.968
The way the sky looks
can move you so much.

41:15.431 --> 41:20.217
Hina really moves my heart.

41:37.704 --> 41:43.201
Yesterday s jingu galen fireworks
were blessed with miraculous sunshine.

41:43.334 --> 41:47.164
Company type but, strong rain is back
again today, just like a backlash.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.711
Your strengths the temperature in the capital
is now 70°f, much lower than average.

41:49.716 --> 41:51.610
The temperature in the capital
is now 70°f, much lower than average.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.049
It's unusually chilly for August.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.211
Make sure you wear a light jacket...

41:56.347 --> 42:01.883
You're my first
company of choice.

42:02.145 --> 42:05.019
I admire skilled and charming people
be careful not fo catch a cold.

42:05.023 --> 42:05.136
I admire skilled
and charming people

42:05.148 --> 42:06.895
I admire skilled and charming people record rainfall
and low temperatures are driving food prices up.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.419
Record rainfall and low temperatures
are ariving food prices up.

42:09.694 --> 42:10.683
Lettuce is three fimes
more expensive than last year.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.903
"Sky fish" report lettuce is three
times more expensive than last year.

42:18.244 --> 42:19.484
Oh, that project?
Right, we've put it on hold.

42:19.495 --> 42:22.404
The sunshine girl is the will of gaia oh,
that project? Right, we've put it on hold.

42:22.415 --> 42:22.528

the sunshine girl is the will of gaia

42:24.584 --> 42:24.913

Yes. Ok.

42:27.837 --> 42:30.919
I'll do my best, so
please call us again.

42:41.601 --> 42:42.601
What?

42:56.157 --> 42:57.939
Hello, this is the mamiya household.

42:58.076 --> 43:01.951
Hello, it's keisuke.
Sorry to rush you.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.528
Regarding the visit...

43:05.124 --> 43:08.241
You're late, kel.
It's an important interview.

43:09.295 --> 43:12.169
Are we in a bad mood?
No luck with work?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.298
Where's hodaka?

43:15.218 --> 43:16.757
Busy with his other job?

43:16.886 --> 43:17.671
Suga hodaka

43:17.678 --> 43:19.297
suga hodaka
he's neglecting work lately.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.425
Just let him be.
We're not that busy.

43:22.558 --> 43:24.511
He took in that cat.

43:24.644 --> 43:25.804
You did the same with him.

43:26.020 --> 43:26.759
Huh?

43:26.896 --> 43:29.311
You helped him because
he reminded you of yourself.

43:31.818 --> 43:35.393
How much are you paying him?

43:35.863 --> 43:38.404
Only $300? That's so low.

43:38.533 --> 43:41.316
- Nope. It's $30.
- What?

43:41.911 --> 43:44.785
Are you serious? $30 a month?
That's exploitation.

43:44.914 --> 43:45.619
I ook ahead.

43:45.748 --> 43:50.832
You're gonna get sued.
Actually, I'll report you.

43:51.129 --> 43:56.835
He gets free food and accommodation,
and the company pays his phone bills.

43:57.135 --> 43:58.341
Ugh!

43:59.804 --> 44:02.254
No wonder he's got an extra job.

44:04.684 --> 44:08.304
I'm surprised.
It's really cleared up.

44:08.896 --> 44:12.726
You kids are amazing.
It's a shame you're quitting.

44:12.859 --> 44:13.859
She was caught on camera.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.024
The web famous sunshine girl?
We got flooded with requests.

44:16.028 --> 44:16.813
The web famous sunshine girl?

44:16.946 --> 44:22.857
We can't cope. We'll do a last one
then stop for a while.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.823
She looks tired, too.

44:28.374 --> 44:30.121
Got guests, granny?

44:30.251 --> 44:31.366
Oh, you're here.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.375
I came to help.

44:33.963 --> 44:37.334
Very young guests.
Are you granny's friends?

44:37.466 --> 44:38.466
Hello.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.634
I've asked for nice weather on
my husband's first anniversary.

44:41.762 --> 44:44.844
It stopped raining, in fact.

44:52.148 --> 44:55.598
It'd be hard for him to come back
if it was raining.

44:55.735 --> 44:56.770
"Come back"?

44:56.903 --> 45:00.903
They say the dead come back
from the sky around August 15.

45:01.532 --> 45:05.362
So, he died a year ago?

45:05.494 --> 45:06.494
Yes.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.907
My mom too.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.416
You lost your mother last year?

45:14.128 --> 45:14.867
Yes.

45:15.004 --> 45:18.420
Light a welcoming fire for her.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.919
She'll protect you.

45:21.469 --> 45:22.469
Thanks.

45:26.849 --> 45:30.932
He'll follow the smoke
and come back.

45:31.604 --> 45:32.684
From where?

45:32.855 --> 45:34.429
From heaven.

45:35.233 --> 45:39.271
There's always been
another world, up in the sky.

45:43.741 --> 45:47.950
Apparently, this is what
the weather maiden saw.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.035
It's a mysterious painting.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.739
Flying fish in the sky.
And even a dragon.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.206
It's beautiful.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.159
Right?

45:56.295 --> 46:00.205
The "weather maiden” was
like a shaman, right?

46:00.800 --> 46:02.502
Huh? What?

46:02.635 --> 46:05.210
Was she like a shaman?

46:05.805 --> 46:06.965
Yeah.

46:08.307 --> 46:12.470
Fixing the weather is
the weather maiden's work.

46:12.853 --> 46:15.602
- Fixing it?
- Sounds like a con.

46:15.731 --> 46:19.102
Like this year's abnormal weather?

46:19.235 --> 46:22.605
There's nothing abnormal about that.

46:23.239 --> 46:28.736
They say “in recorded history,"

46:28.995 --> 46:31.569
but when did records begin?

46:31.706 --> 46:33.245
100 years ago at best.

46:33.374 --> 46:36.248
How old do you think this is?

46:36.460 --> 46:37.829
800 years old.

46:37.962 --> 46:38.962
8007?

46:40.089 --> 46:42.250
Don't get too excited, grandpa.

46:45.261 --> 46:48.631
The weather changes on a whim.

46:48.764 --> 46:50.763
Regardless of human needs.

46:50.891 --> 46:53.845
We can't even tell
what's the norm and what isn't.

46:53.978 --> 46:57.140
We're only allowed to stay temporarily

46:57.273 --> 47:00.848
in the space between
the sky and earth,

47:00.985 --> 47:04.860
clinging hard not to be shaken off.

47:04.989 --> 47:09.441
We used to be well aware
of this in the past.

47:10.745 --> 47:16.622
But, there's a thin thread
linking us humans and the sky.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.617
The weather maiden.

47:19.628 --> 47:20.242
I pray for good weather
the weather maiden.

47:20.254 --> 47:20.367
I pray for good weather

47:20.379 --> 47:22.954
I pray for good weather a special girl who can take
in people's wishes and deliver them to the sky.

47:22.965 --> 47:23.454
A special girl who can take in people's
wishes and deliver them to the sky.

47:23.466 --> 47:27.529
I pray for the rain to stop a special girl who can
take in people's wishes and deliver them to the sky.

47:27.553 --> 47:33.464
In ancient times, there was one
in every village and every country.

47:33.601 --> 47:35.808
Kel.
It sounds like the sunshine girl.

47:35.936 --> 47:39.269
Are you sure you want
to listen to my grandpa?

47:39.398 --> 47:41.479
It all sounds pretty far-fetched.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.522
It's a very interesting story.
We're thankful.

47:45.654 --> 47:50.322
But, everything comes
at a price.

47:51.327 --> 47:56.571
A tragic fate awaits
the weather maiden.

47:57.416 --> 47:59.452
Tachibana

47:59.460 --> 48:00.324
tachibana one, two, three.

48:00.336 --> 48:01.909
One, two, three.

48:02.338 --> 48:04.336
Your turn.

48:05.299 --> 48:06.964
One, two, three.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.334
Thanks for keeping
granny company.

48:09.470 --> 48:11.802
We're actually here
because of work.

48:11.931 --> 48:13.595
Join us, granny.

48:14.683 --> 48:17.683
They're having fun.
How old are you guys?

48:17.812 --> 48:20.098
I'm 16. She's...

48:22.024 --> 48:24.898
She said it's her
birthday next week.

48:25.027 --> 48:27.602
Really? You've gotta
buy her a present.

48:29.615 --> 48:31.696
Come eat some watermelon.

48:31.826 --> 48:34.112
- Yaay!
- Thank you.

48:39.208 --> 48:41.115
Hey, wait!

48:49.093 --> 48:50.542
Dang.

48:55.349 --> 48:56.968
Jeez. Why?

48:58.978 --> 49:00.138
Wait a minute.

49:15.953 --> 49:20.036
I didn't know she was
a minor, I swear.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.624
It's not about that?

49:23.752 --> 49:25.959
I told you it wasn't.

49:26.088 --> 49:28.124
You made us run for nothing.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.339
That's you, right?

49:32.052 --> 49:35.673
Can you tell us about this boy?

49:38.851 --> 49:41.679
A high school boy?

49:41.896 --> 49:45.979
Maybe he picked up by chance
the gun shibata threw away.

49:46.650 --> 49:50.192
In that case, he might
have posted about it.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.650
Online, you mean?

49:54.700 --> 49:55.780
Kids write all sorts of stuff
on social networks nowadays.

49:55.784 --> 49:58.744
I'm 16 years old kids write all sorts
of stuff on social networks nowadays.

50:01.790 --> 50:05.241
What's the best birthday
present for an 18 y/o girl?

50:05.377 --> 50:06.708
Posted

50:09.298 --> 50:10.583
4 answers

50:11.467 --> 50:13.214
don't ask online

50:15.513 --> 50:17.386
go, nasi!

50:17.806 --> 50:20.221
- You're amazing, nagi!
- You're the best.

50:23.938 --> 50:25.720
A ring. Definitely.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.851
Really? Isn't it too serious?

50:28.984 --> 50:31.100
It's for my sister's
birthday, right?

50:31.237 --> 50:34.236
I've asked another woman
for reference, but...

50:34.490 --> 50:36.063
What I'd like to get?

50:36.200 --> 50:37.819
Hugs and kisses. Cash.

50:37.952 --> 50:39.988
A decent boyfriend. And a job.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.865
It wasn't helpful at all.

50:43.582 --> 50:45.122
- Aring...
- Bye bye, nagi.

50:45.251 --> 50:46.491
See you, nagi.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.502
You're in love
with hina, aren't you?

50:50.756 --> 50:51.495
What?

50:51.632 --> 50:53.793
Er, it's not like that.

50:53.926 --> 50:56.007
Or maybe it is?

50:56.345 --> 50:59.507
Being ambivalent
is the worst thing for a man.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.342
Really?

51:01.475 --> 51:06.018
Be clear before you start dating
and be ambiguous later. It's the basics.

51:08.148 --> 51:10.518
Can I call you nagi sempai?

51:13.529 --> 51:17.233
Hina's been working all the time
since mom died.

51:17.366 --> 51:22.071
She's been doing it for me,
because I'm still a kid.

51:23.414 --> 51:27.163
So, I want her to do more
teenage-like stuff.

51:27.293 --> 51:29.787
I don't know if you're
the right guy, though.

51:32.381 --> 51:34.288
Thank you very much.

51:37.386 --> 51:41.295
Er, do you think she'll like it?

51:41.599 --> 51:42.599
Huh?

51:43.934 --> 51:46.554
It took you three hours
to choose it.

51:46.979 --> 51:49.311
If it were I,
I'd be very happy to receive it.

51:50.065 --> 51:51.479
I wish you the best of luck.

51:54.653 --> 51:56.561
Longest rain spell record broken

51:56.572 --> 51:59.652
longest rain spell record broken tomorrow's
sunshine girl job will be our last

52:00.326 --> 52:05.743
a man requested good weather
at the park for his daughfter.

52:06.790 --> 52:10.666
After that,
11 give hina the ring.

52:22.097 --> 52:24.926
Daddy, do it again.
One more time!

52:25.184 --> 52:27.425
Right. Ready?

52:27.978 --> 52:29.263
(Go!

52:32.733 --> 52:35.941
Ow. This is bad for your back.

52:36.362 --> 52:40.480
Why you, Mr. suga?
Did you know this was my job?

52:40.616 --> 52:44.950
You knew and said nothing?
Actually, you have a daughter?

52:45.496 --> 52:49.450
I'm stunned.
Today's forecast was 100% rain.

52:52.002 --> 52:54.372
My daughter has asthma.

52:54.672 --> 53:00.215
She lives with her granny, who
won't let me see her on rainy days.

53:01.136 --> 53:03.965
Nothing can beat
a gorgeous blue sky.

53:04.098 --> 53:06.881
So, you're hodaka's boss.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.432
I also saved his life.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.597
Why does she treat you
like a little boy?

53:11.730 --> 53:14.479
Hina's two years older than me.

53:14.608 --> 53:17.941
Huh? 16, 17, 18. Same stuff.

53:18.070 --> 53:19.439
- I guess.
- It's not.

53:19.571 --> 53:20.731
There you are!

53:21.156 --> 53:23.237
Hi, guys!

53:23.659 --> 53:27.200
Aren't you gonna be in trouble?

53:27.413 --> 53:29.987
Does natsumi know
you're married?

53:30.290 --> 53:32.497
What's up with you guys?

53:36.296 --> 53:39.504
Hodaka thought you were my...

53:39.800 --> 53:41.169
Mistress?

53:42.469 --> 53:45.631
You didn't tell me
you were uncle and niece.

53:45.764 --> 53:48.050
That's a disgusting fantasy.

53:48.183 --> 53:49.514
You're dirty-minded.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.225
Hey, hodaka.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.348
You looked at my boobs.

53:57.484 --> 53:58.519
I didn't!

53:58.819 --> 54:00.521
Natsumi!

54:00.738 --> 54:02.485
Hello, moka!

54:02.614 --> 54:05.489
Daddy, I made a garland.
It's for you.

54:05.617 --> 54:07.031
Really?

54:07.286 --> 54:08.526
Come here, hodaka.

54:08.954 --> 54:10.990
My sempai's calling me.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.657
Hodaka's hilarious.

54:14.793 --> 54:16.367
He's such a kid.

54:17.296 --> 54:20.249
Don't you think they're similar?

54:20.382 --> 54:22.047
- Hodaka and Mr. suga?
- Yep.

54:22.176 --> 54:25.796
Kei ran away from home and came
to Tokyo when he was a teen.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.804
He met his future wife
and fell in love big time.

54:29.892 --> 54:33.179
But, she died in an accident
some years ago.

54:33.312 --> 54:35.553
He's still in love with her.

54:37.649 --> 54:40.811
I've been dying to meet you
for so long, hina.

54:40.986 --> 54:43.860
The 100% sunshine girl.
You're amazing.

54:43.989 --> 54:47.898
I wish I had a skill like that on my
resume. I hate looking for a job.

54:48.035 --> 54:49.737
I wish I was still
in high school too.

54:50.537 --> 54:54.575
I can't wait to be
a grown-up instead.

54:56.376 --> 55:00.494
Right. Good to see you're ok.

55:01.048 --> 55:03.084
I was actually a bit worried.

55:12.309 --> 55:15.805
Are you tired, moka?
Here, take a breath.

55:15.938 --> 55:18.019
One, two, three.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.477
I'm fine. Let's play!

55:21.610 --> 55:22.610
I don't think...

55:23.070 --> 55:25.735
I guess we'll leave now.

55:25.864 --> 55:29.026
I want to spend
more time with nagi!

55:29.159 --> 55:31.400
Why don't we all go
to dinner together?

55:31.537 --> 55:32.367
But...

55:32.496 --> 55:35.783
I'll go eat with moka. Is it ok?

55:35.916 --> 55:37.490
- Sure.
- Yaay!

55:37.626 --> 55:39.373
Hodaka, take hina home.

55:41.255 --> 55:42.255
Hey.

55:44.216 --> 55:47.792
Thank you for bringing
the sunshine today!

55:49.221 --> 55:50.221
Thank you.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.964
I'm glad I made you happy.

56:07.531 --> 56:12.316
Oh my god. Oh my god.

56:14.288 --> 56:17.325
So, possibly this is gonna be...

56:17.457 --> 56:20.494
The first time I tell
a girl I love her.

56:28.969 --> 56:30.588
- Hina.
- Hodaka.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.214
- Sorry.
- [T's ok.

56:32.431 --> 56:34.880
- What is it?
- Nothing in particular.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.632
What were you saying?

56:40.439 --> 56:43.104
Hodaka, you know...

56:46.361 --> 56:47.567
I...

56:57.915 --> 56:58.915
Hina!

57:04.963 --> 57:06.169
Hodaka!

57:06.423 --> 57:07.583
Hina?

57:36.411 --> 57:38.447
I think I became
a sunshine git...

57:39.706 --> 57:42.823
Last year, on that aay.

57:51.093 --> 57:55.211
I prayed for good weather
all day long the day before.

57:55.722 --> 57:59.218
I wanted fo have one last walk
under the sun with my mom.

58:05.315 --> 58:08.731
It looked like a pool of light.

58:09.194 --> 58:12.645
Praying with all my heart,
I crossed the shrine gate.

58:26.294 --> 58:29.203
When I came arouna,
I was lying on the roof floor.

58:29.715 --> 58:31.333
And the sky was clear.

58:39.975 --> 58:41.215
I think

58:42.185 --> 58:46.015
that's when I got
connected to the sky.

58:51.570 --> 58:54.652
Connected to the sky?

58:57.367 --> 58:58.986
Stay in there, hodaka.

59:01.830 --> 59:03.991
Police.
Sorry for the late visit.

59:04.416 --> 59:05.496
The police?

59:05.959 --> 59:07.995
Are you sure
you've never seen him?

59:08.712 --> 59:13.046
He's been seen many times
around here.

59:13.842 --> 59:14.842
I don't know him.

59:16.011 --> 59:17.424
What has he done?

59:17.554 --> 59:20.129
We want to ask him
some questions.

59:20.265 --> 59:25.266
He's a runaway. His parents
filed a missing person's report.

59:26.188 --> 59:31.307
Also, you're living alone
with your little brother, right?

59:31.443 --> 59:32.273
That's right.

59:32.402 --> 59:35.022
That's a bit of a problem too.

59:35.614 --> 59:37.612
Without a guardian, you...

59:37.741 --> 59:38.741
But!

59:39.034 --> 59:42.033
We don't bother anyone.

59:45.415 --> 59:46.575
Hina.

59:46.750 --> 59:51.293
She'll come back tomorrow
with the social service.

59:51.588 --> 59:54.291
What can I do?
They'll separate us!

59:55.634 --> 59:58.542
Mr. suga

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.477
Hodaka! The police were...

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.515
I know.
Go home, I'll come later.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.894
Temperatures have fallen
sharply after sunset.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.361
Mr. suga?

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.064
Surprised by my new look?

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.073
I'm in disguise.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.572
The police came to my office.
They're treating it like a kidnapping.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.368
I denied any involvement,
but they suspect me.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:35.746
Take it. It's your severance pay.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:40.712
Don't come back to the office.
They'll arrest me.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:49.221
I filed for custody of my daughter.
It's a delicate time, sorry.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.100
Go back home tomorrow.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.978
Then everything will
g0 back to normal.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:01:00.566
It'll be best for everyone.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.194
It's time to grow up, kid.

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:16.126
We can't stay here anymore.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.208
But, where are you...

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.673
I don't know, but...

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.258
Anywhere will do.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.718
As long as I'm with you.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.303
Hodaka, you'd better go home
before you get caught.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.555
You've got a place
to go back to.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.224
Don't say that.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.232
We'll be fine.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.231
I'm not going back.

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:43.734
Let's run away together.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:54.541
A heavy rain special warning has
just been issued in the Tokyo area.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.253
It could be the heaviest
rainfall in decaoes.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:01.001
Watch out for floods
mn lowland areas.

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:03.508
A sudden typhoon-strength
low-pressure system...

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:07.963
River flooding.
Increasing danger.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:09.764
Hey, it's overflowing!

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.721
Keep calm and walk slowly
towards the exit.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:13.934
Namboku line akabane-iwabuchi station,
shibuya Metro station...

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:14.268
Heavy rain and special warning

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:14.601

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:16.807

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.766
several flights canceled
at haneda airport.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:24.988
Over 6 inches of rain in an hour.
Heavy flooding in many areas of Tokyo.

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:29.533
Evacuation order kita ward, arakawa wara,
taito ward, sumida ward, shibuya ward.

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.532
You may get stranded.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:33.997

a heavy rain special warning
has been issued in the Tokyo area.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:52.049
The low-pressure system over
the kanto region...

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:55.681
Because of a stream of cold air over
kanto, very unstable weather...

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:59.022
More heavy rain in central Japan
even after dawn.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:03.105
This abnormal weather
will continue for a few weeks.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:07.067
This abnormal weather is unprecedented
and extremely dangerous.

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:14.738
Ikebukuro train delays

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:18.325
ikebukuro train delays due fo transportation
delays, yamanote line trains are suspended.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.418
Due fo transportation delays,
yamanote line trains are suspended.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:22.996
What the heck?

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.881
- Let's get off.
- I'll ask mom to pick us up.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:26.750
It's freezing.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:28.255
What should we do?

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:31.341
Let's look for a place
to sleep tonight.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.846
I'm sorry, we're fully booked.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.598
Do you have a reservation?

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.099
We're full.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.601
Only the three of you?

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:43.061
Do you have ID?

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.964
Love hotel
we can't accept unaccompanied minors.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.607
It's not a matter of money.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.612
It's no place for kids.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.075
You guys...

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.410
Are you runaways?

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.129
Hina, hodaka. Look!

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.210
Snow?

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.449
Cold drink

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:54.428
Midsummer snow

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:06.016
Hina is connected
with the sky...?

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.450
It's freezing!

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.455
Hey kel, it's snowing in August.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:27.586
The world's finally gone crazy.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.050
Oh?

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:33.669
It's unbelievable, but
it's snowing here in Tokyo.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.220
Kei, wake up.
You'll catch a cold.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600
Asuka.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.725
Asuka. You too, kel. Smile.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:47.728
Heater

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.736
brr.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:55.114
You look like an old man, kei.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.241
You know, once you grow old

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:02.747
you can't switch
your priorities anymore.

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.493
What are you saying?
Where's hodaka?

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.625
You kicked him out?
I can't believe it!

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:14.796
I told you, the police showed up.
I've got to protect myself.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:19.263
So, you smoked a pack of cigarettes
and got drunk because you felt guilty.

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:21.762
That's so uncool, meow.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.767
Even rain's saying it.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:28.981
Really uncool. So last century.
Can you stay away? You smell old.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:33.019
You're uncool too.
What's her name... hina?

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.776
If the story about the
weather maiden being...

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:39.116
A human sacrifice is true,
then one day she'll...

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:40.777
But, that's...

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:43.283
What should I have done, then?

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.290
Don't get so uptight.
It's just bullshit.

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:49.745
But, if it was true...

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:59.296
If you could fix this crazy weather with
one human sacrifice, I'd be happy.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.803
Everyone would.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:08.016
A heavy rain and heavy snow warning
has been issued.

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:10.283
Don't go out if it's not
strictly necessary...

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:11.186
Heavy rain special warning

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.689
heavy rain special warning please follow
local government evacuation instructions.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:13.809
Heavy rain special warning

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:14.310
heavy rain special warning
you kids.

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.322
You kids.

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:18.488
It's dangerous to walk around
unsupervised.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.612
Are you all siblings?

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:21.745
Fr

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.654
We're going home.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.698
I'm a college student.
They're my younger brothers.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.581
I see. Can you show me your ID?

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.829
I don't have it on me.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.748
Maybe it's him.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.884
He may be carrying a gun.
Be careful.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:42.846
And you? Are you in high school?
That's a big backpack.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.470
Can you remove your hood?

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:47.969
Hina.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.189
Run away.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.234
Hey! Wait!

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:54.107
Stop!

01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:58.112
- Gotcha!
- Let me go!

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.200
Resisting arrest.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.283
- Let me go!
- Stop struggling.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:08.792
Hodaka!

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:11.375
Stop!

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:15.417
Hina.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.089
Please!

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:34.026
It's dangerous.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.067
Let's go, hina.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.865
- Jeez.
- Let's go take a look.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:45.072
Sempai.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:55.874
It's $280 a night.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.252
$280. Can you pay?

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:00.879
Huh? Yes. I'll pay.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:14.850
Seems like I'm a wanted man now.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.649
That's so cool.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.984
- I was really worried.
- You almost got arrested.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:28.156
I totally panicked.
There's nothing to laugh about.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.456
This room is huge!

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.907
The bed"s huge!
The bathroom's huge!

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.915
Hina. Hodaka.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:38.712
Let's take a bath together.

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:40.835
Do it alone.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:44.801
Hodaka, let's take
a boys-only bath together.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.925
It's so warm.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.430
What's this?

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:56.606
- Wow!
- Amazing.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.683
Switch.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.694
There's a lot of stuff.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.568
- What do you want?
- Let's try them all, sempai.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.908
- Are you sure?
- I got severance pay.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:10.278
Hina, we're having
a gorgeous dinner tonight.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:11.912
Looking forward to it.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.950
Fried chicken

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.455
here t am.

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:19.875
Welcome back.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:31.473
I et's eat.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.347
Let me try that, hodaka.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.806
- The curry"s yummy.
- Yakisoba's delicious.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.391
I want some too.

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:41.563
Isn't it too early, hodaka?

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:43.478
Tastes yummier if you wait
only two minutes.

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:46.276
The forfune cookie in love

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:49.696
the future's not looking so grim

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.244
the thing thats in your heart

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.118
the thing that soon will disappear

01:10:55.251 --> 01:11:00.001
dear god, if you really exist,
I beg you.

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:04.215
This is more than enough.
We don't need anything else.

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:06.759
We'll manage somehow.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:11.806
So please, don't give us
anything more,

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.138
and aon t take anything
more from us.

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:19.935
I beg you please, dear god.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.685
Let us be fogether
like this forever

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:27.904
hina.

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:31.283
Happy 18th birthday.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:36.281
It's cheap, but I've picked something
that'd look good on you.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:40.962
Thanks.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:45.801
Tell me, hodaka.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:50.886
Would you like
this rain to stop?

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:53.809
Yes.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:04.482
I was chosen to be
a human sacrifice.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.567
Natsumi told me about
the sunshine girl's fate.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:16.196
She gets sacrificed and disappears,
then the weather goes back to normal.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:18.416
Come on.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:23.787
They're always telling weird stories.
It's not like people disappear...

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:37.721
What are you looking at?

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:39.639
I'm not looking...

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.401
I'm looking at you.

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:51.154
Why are you crying?

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:58.116
The more I pray for sunshine, the more
my body becomes transparent.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.997
I'm sure that,
if I die this way,

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:05.002
the usual summer will come back.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.504
- Take care of nagi.
- No.

01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:11.133
No way.
You're not going anywhere.

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.009
We'll live together.
The three of us.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:14.139
Hodaka.

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:16.760
Let's make a promise, hina.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:18.845
We'll always be together.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.480
I'll work.
I'll earn enough for all of us.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:28.275
You quit the sunshine girl job.
Your body will go back to normal.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.484
So...

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.798
I had a dream.

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.879
I was still on the 1s/and.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.893
[I wanted fo leave.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:07.105
I was rushing desperately,
trying to reach the light.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:13.817
When I thought I dia,
I reached a dead end instead.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:19.030
Then I decided I wanted
fo enter that light

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:24.540
and at the edge of if,
I found you.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.627
I had a dream.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.623
The aay I met you.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.920
You looked lke a lost kitten.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:42.428
But you ve found a meaning
for my existence.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:48.101
I kept working as the sunshine gir!
Cos I was happy fo make people smile.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.895
I'm really glad I've met you.

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.947
So, don't cry, hodaka.

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:14.082
What is this place?

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.631
Hodaka...

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:08.102
Hina?

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:09.602
Where are you?

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.024
Hina.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.853
- Hina?
- What's wrong, hodaka?

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.819
Hina's disappeared.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:23.112
I just dreamt...
That she was disappearing in the sky.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:30.161
Don't tell me...

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:32.796
Open the door.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:35.875
- Open up!
- What?

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:40.383
Hodaka morishima, right?

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:47.008
You're a missing person. And suspected
of unlawful possession of a weapon.

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:49.385
- Come to the police station.
- Let me go!

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.395
- I won't hurt you.
- Let me go, I said!

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:53.397
- Hodaka!
- Sempai.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.641
Don't struggle.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.656
Keep going.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:19.460
After months of rain, the kanto plain is
finally seeing some brilliant sunshine.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.468
[11 seems unreal.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:24.928
In the last few hours,
a sudden change in...

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:27.382
By 8 A.M. the temperature
was already over 77 f.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:28.932
It's a miracle! Many areas around
the arakawa river are flooded.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:29.140
Many areas around the
arakawa river are flooded.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.476
Flooded but it's sunny many areas
around the arakawa river are flooded.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:30.683
Many areas around the
arakawa river are flooded.

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:30.847
Thanks sunshine girl I saw her in a dream many
areas around the arakawa river are flooded.

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:30.968
Thanks sunshine girl
I saw her in a dream

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.060
thanks sunshine girl I saw her in a dream
the transport system is still paralyzed...

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:32.393
The transport system
is still paralyzed...

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:32.762
I think I had the same dream the
transport system is still paralyzed...

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:32.886
I think I had the same dream

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:33.683
I think I had the same dream the extent
of the damage has yet fo be assessed.

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.502
The extent of the damage
has yet fo be assessed.

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:38.434
Lake a few days
at least for recovery.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.026
Everyone looks happy
under the clear blue sky.

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.259
First sunshine in 72 days everyone
looks happy under the clear blue sky.

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:44.156
- Hey, look at the sky.
- Is it for real?

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:46.192
- It's sunny.
- It cleared up!

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.201
The sky's so clear.

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:50.158
I feel like crying.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:53.499
Finally, real summer
has arrived.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.964
What are you doing?

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:09.719
Hina...

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.476
Sacrificed herself.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.311
- Hina! Tell me it's not true!
- Hey!

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.060
Hina!

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.066
I've got a question.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:30.278
The girl who was with you yesterday
is 15-year-old hina amano, right?

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.239
Do you know where she is?

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:37.076
Hina's 157

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:39.335
not 187

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:43.169
she faked her resume at work.

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:46.844
I guess she had to make a living,
but she's still in middle school.

01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:49.634
Compulsory school age.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.389
Didn't you know?

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.138
What the heck?

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:58.229
I'm the oldest one.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.190
What a pain.

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:04.486
Don't you know where she may be?

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:10.408
The sky has cleared because
she offered herself in exchange.

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:14.864
And nobody knows that...
I can't take it.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:16.953
This is a pain.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.868
Will we need an expert
medical withess?

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:24.877
It's clear

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:41.018
Daaay! Did you look outside?

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:42.311
Yeah, I did.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.776
I dreamt of hina.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:48.901
I'm sure it was her
who brought the sunshine again.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:53.162
Yeah.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:56.117
Maybe you're right.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.325
Ikebukuro police station

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:00.647
ikebukuro police station
excuse me.

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:03.624
Detective,
I've got a favor to ask you.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.633
What?

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:10.636
Let me go look for hina.
It's my turn to help her now.

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.638
I'll come back
as soon as I find her.

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:16.551
I'll listen to you in here.
Come on.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:21.063
Tell Mr. yasui
we'll interrogate him now.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.191
Yes, sir.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.187
Hey! Wait!

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:29.487
Wait!

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.111
Someone stop him!

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:33.526
Stop!

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:38.698
- That brat!
- Don't let him get out of here.

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:40.793
Stop!

01:20:41.628 --> 01:20:42.743
Wait!

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:43.963
Stop!

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.300
Bastard.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.182
What the hell?!

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.802
Cheeky bastard.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:57.935
Cross the street.

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.809
Darn!

01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:16.245
Hodaka.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.290
- Natsumi?
- What are you doing?

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:23.830
I'm going to find hina.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.414
Get on.

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:35.845
That brat!

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:38.844
Nagi called.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:42.098
He said hina has disappeared
and you got arrested.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.311
Where is he?

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.855
At the child consultation center.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:54.615
How exciting. We're outlaws now!

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:57.988
Where are we going, then?

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:04.575
What? Another visitor?

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:07.377
Visitor: Ayane hanazawa

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:08.833
oh, another girl.

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:11.714
He's popular.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:13.458
Visiting room

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:14.470
visiting room nagi.

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:16.799
Ayane! You're here too.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.427
- Kana, this is ayane.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.641
- Ayane, this is kana.
- Nice to meet you.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.725
And she's officer sasaki.
She'll be here with me all day.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:29.733
You're like a vip, nagi.
Pleased to meet you.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:30.977
Today's meeting record

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:33.028
today's meeting record thank
you so much for coming.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:35.022
Sorry for the sudden news.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:39.068
Really! When I heard they took you
into custody, my heart almost stopped.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.445
Same for me.
My heart's still pounding.

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:43.534
Touch and feel it, nagi.

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:46.916
Oh, you're right.

01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:53.256
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:56.881
It's my first visit.
I'm a bit nervous.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:58.094
Huh?

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.134
I need the toilet.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.886
Oh, ok.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.394
Thanks, I owe you one.

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:11.607
Jeez. You even call your ex
when you need something.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.154
Here.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:15.896
Look the other way.
I'll take my clothes off.

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.124
Mr. keisuke suga.

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:29.622
Thanks for yesterday.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:31.294
You again?

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:34.665
Summer's finally back
the way it should, huh?

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:38.839
I told you I know nothing
about that runaway boy.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:40.880
Can we check out
your office for a minute?

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.924
- Hey, what's that for?
- Oh, it's flooded.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:45.934
There's no one in there.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:51.189
Well, it's a bit
embarrassing, but...

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:53.442
Huh? He ran away?

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:54.985
From the police station?

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.445
A derelict building in yoyogi?

01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:59.652
That's where she became
a sunshine girl.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:00.900
Bend down!

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:07.455
She said she got connected to the sky
on the roof of that building.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:10.284
So, if I go there, I'm sure...

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.297
Oh, no!

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.887
You, on that bike! Stop!

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:24.135
Hold tight!

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:32.598
Whoa!

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:34.485
Natsumi!

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:37.736
Am I awesome or what?
I think t was born for this.

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:39.483
Maybe...

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:43.116
I should become a speed cop!

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:46.490
They won't hire you now.

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:52.830
As for the reason for his escape...

01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:57.581
I think he may be searching
for the girl who was with him.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:58.298
I'm going shopping asuka

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:01.005
I'm going shopping

01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:06.260
he said she's disappeared
in exchange for this good weather.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:09.844
What? Don't tell me you...

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.266
No, I don't believe it.

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:16.312
But, he's throwing his life away.

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:22.610
And all because there's a girl
he wants to meet so badly.

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:25.905
Moka 2 y/o moka 1y/o makes
me feel a bit envious.

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:30.072
There's not much point
in telling me that.

01:25:34.004 --> 01:25:36.211
Mr. suga, you...

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.340
Huh?

01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:40.211
Are you ok?

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:41.420
Why?

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.924
Well, you are...

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.756
Crying.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.817
Oh, no.

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:00.443
We're jumping in!

01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:13.498
Can't go any further.

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:15.409
Go, hodaka.

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.210
Thank you, natsumi.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:27.463
Hodaka!

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:30.382
Run!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.957
Hina. Hina. Hina. Hina!

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:04.298
Are you there? Hina!

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.715
Hey, hodaka.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:09.971
It clear up now.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:13.892
It's for you.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.227
You ve eaten that for dinner
three nights in a row.

01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:18.563
- Does it hurt?
- You're a runaway, aren't you?

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:21.061
But, you can't enjoy Tokyo
with this ramn.

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:22.563
Younger than me.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:23.401
I7 be 18 next month.

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:24.424
Hina's birthday
tl be 78 next month.

01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:25.728
You should treat me
with respect.

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:27.273
Are you hungry, hodaka?

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:28.569
Sit there and relax.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.075
How do you like living in Tokyo?

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:32.077
Come fo think of it

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:35.117
I don't feel like
I'm suffocating anymore.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.824
Happy fo hear that.

01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:41.586
I'm in love with
this sunshine girl job.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:45.340
Thank you, hoadaka.

01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:50.340
Someone got onto the tracks.

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:52.346
- Who's that?
- Hey, you!

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.094
It's dangerous!

01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:55.724
Hey! What are you doing?

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:57.806
It's dangerous! Stop!

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.228
- What's that? Hilarious.
- What is he doing?

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.602
- There's someone running.
- He'll get arrested.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.521
There are idiots like that.

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:24.504
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.172
I'm sorry, hina!

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.208
I made you ado that
sunshine girl thing.

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:31.632
You ve shouldered
all responsibility.

01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:32.765
Tell me...

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:34.058
Hodzaka.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.847
Would you like
this rain fo stop?

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.084
Mr. suga?

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.341
I was looking for you, hodaka.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:11.255
Why?

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:14.550
Do you realize
what you're doing?

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.222
Hina's disappeared.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.597
It's my fault.
The sunshine girl job was my idea.

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:20.593
Hodaka, you...

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:22.683
It's my turn to help her now!

01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:26.183
I must go.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:28.189
Wait!

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.193
Where are you...

01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:31.438
I can go to heaven
through there!

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:35.571
What are you saying?

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:38.657
She's in the sky!
I'll use the emergency stairs.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:42.286
- She can't be up there...
- I have to help her!

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:44.201
Get a grip!

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:47.750
Calm down.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.790
Go back to the police station.

01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:52.963
They'll understand.
You've done nothing wrong.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:57.972
If you keep running away,
it'll be too late. You know that.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.975
Suspect's car found.
Going to apprehend him.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:04.229
Don't worry, I'll come with you.

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:06.974
Let's explain everything
together, ok?

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.441
Let me go! Please!

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:10.443
Calm down.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:11.572
Get off me!

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:13.734
You bastard!

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.994
Don't stand in my way!

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.699
Hodaka. That's...

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:27.077
Let me go see hina.

01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:42.433
I was born with nothing
in my hand

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:48.769
forever wallowing
in an eternal gap

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:50.350
hodaka morishima.

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:51.980
Drop the gun.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:55.609
Hey, wait a minute.

01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:59.075
It's a misunderstanding.
I'll explain.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:00.319
Right, hodaka?

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:03.871

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.374
Put the gun down, morishima.

01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:08.376
Please don't make me shoot.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:21.892
Hodaka.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.601
Come on hodaka,

I eave me alone!

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:35.062
Why are you holding me up? You all
know nothing. You pretend you don't.

01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:38.568
I just want to see her...

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:39.994
Once more!

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:47.543
Got him!

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.578

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:10.691
Nagi!

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:13.110
Hey!

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.602
It's all your fault, hodaka.

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:18.613
Bring my sister back!

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:30.458
Is there still anything

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:38.549
Is there still anything
that I can oo?

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:45.928
You gave me strength,

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:52.517

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:53.435

is there still anything
that love can odo?

01:32:55.361 --> 01:33:00.317
Is there still anything that love can do?
Please, please, please.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.267
Sky fish?

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:02.171

01:34:57.233 --> 01:35:02.606
is if a crime fo
aream another dream?

01:35:05.491 --> 01:35:06.480
Summer sees the back of Autumn

01:35:06.492 --> 01:35:08.195
summer sees the back of Autumn
I found you!

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:08.362

Guessing what it looks like from behind
don't let go of my hands. Ok.

01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:17.409
Guessing what it
looks like from behind

01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:23.960
is this a yearning,
is this love?

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:30.759
It's unrequited, we know

01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:31.892
hina!

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:33.515

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.308
Let's stand on the blind side
of the sun let's go home, hina.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:42.900
Let's stand on the
blind side of the sun

let's stand on the blind side of the
sun but, if I do, the weather will...

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:44.352

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:49.069
When he's awake it's enough.

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:49.315
When he's awake

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:50.316
when he's awake you don't have
to be the sunshine girl anymore.

01:35:50.328 --> 01:35:50.441
You don't have to be
the sunshine girl anymore.

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:51.568
We'll be where they can't bring us back you
don't have to be the sunshine girl anymore.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.786
We'll be where they

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:11.053
I want you
more than any blue sky.

01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:14.341

01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:34.197
it's not that we re not scared

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.204
but we won't stop

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:39.248
we may get ahead of hard times

01:36:39.419 --> 01:36:42.789

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:48.841

Ok.

01:37:22.628 --> 01:37:23.834
Hodaka.

01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:48.021
All love songs had been sung

01:37:48.821 --> 01:37:55.111
myriad movies had
fold thelr sfories

01:37:55.828 --> 01:38:01.706

01:38:02.502 --> 01:38:07.586
in such a wastelana, and yet

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:13.592
the rain started falling again
that day, and never stopped.

01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:17.676
It's slowly sinking Tokyo
nto the water

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:22.594
and its still falling now,
three years later.

01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:32.983
How fast time flies, I can't believe
how quickly the moments have passed...

01:38:33.157 --> 01:38:41.157
The precious years have come and gone
foo soon, here with you

01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:52.627

fo do what must be done

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:13.486
Er... you're moving
to Tokyo, aren't you?

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.362
Huh? Yeah.

01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:18.945
Come on, ask him.
It's now or never.

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:21.740
So, possibly, this is...

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:26.786
You know... there's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

01:39:26.919 --> 01:39:29.126
The first time someone
tells me they love me?

01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:32.379
I'd like to know...

01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:33.758

Is it true you're wanted
by the police in Tokyo?

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:39.514
Huh?

01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:46.177
That summer of three years ago,

01:39:47.482 --> 01:39:50.932
I was arrested Ana went on trial

01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:54.978
they put me on probation
until graquation.

01:39:55.364 --> 01:39:58.273
The island, my parents' house
and the school...

01:39:58.451 --> 01:40:01.946
They all were the same old places
where I was supposed fo live.

01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:06.664
But, I just kept quietly waiting
for graduation.

01:40:07.919 --> 01:40:08.919

01:40:10.505 --> 01:40:13.504

01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.426
I have no idea what I'l think

01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:23.051

01:40:23.601 --> 01:40:26.384

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.304
Tomorrow's weather

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:52.160
Speaking of part-time jobs...

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:57.502
Sunshine for you

01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.874
sunshine for you
it's still there.

01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:59.125
It's still there.

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:03.387
1 request

01:41:04.684 --> 01:41:07.133
it was a sunshine girl request

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:09.514
from two years ago.

01:41:09.647 --> 01:41:13.098
Next sfop takashimaaaira.

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:15.608
Look who's here. Are you alone?

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:17.644
Tachibana
where's the sunshine girl?

01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:21.147
She's no longer a sunshine girl.

01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:24.408
I came just to tell you that.

01:41:25.413 --> 01:41:26.906
Don't trouble yourself.

01:41:28.124 --> 01:41:32.620
You moved. You used to live
in an older house downtown.

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:36.374
The whole area
is under water now.

01:41:36.632 --> 01:41:37.667
I'm sorry.

01:41:38.467 --> 01:41:39.916
Why do you apologize?

01:41:40.428 --> 01:41:41.428
Um...

01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:50.017
You know, that area
used to be under the sea.

01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:54.100
Until 200 years ago.

01:41:55.192 --> 01:41:58.734
In old times, Tokyo
was just a bay.

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:03.234
Human beings and the weather
changed it, little by little.

01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:10.287
So, well... I think it's just
gone back to its original self.

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:12.952
What the heck .. 7?

01:42:13.336 --> 01:42:15.452
You've been thinking
about that crap for three years?

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:16.877
Don't say that...

01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:20.881
You're about to start college,
but you're still acting like a kid.

01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:23.008
But, that day we...

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:28.221
You two caused this?
You changed the world?

01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:34.763
Bullshit.
Don't flatter yourself, dummy.

01:42:36.609 --> 01:42:39.228
Look, I went on a date
with my daughter.

01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:41.981
But, natsumi and nagi
were in the way.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:47.237
Stop brooding over
stupid stuff and go see her.

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:48.783
Why haven't you?

01:42:48.913 --> 01:42:52.488
I was on probation.
I didn't want to cause her trouble.

01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:54.623
She doesn't even have a cellphone.

01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:56.959
And I'm so nervous.

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:59.707
I don't know what to say to her.

01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:08.212
Rain? You're so big now.

01:43:08.557 --> 01:43:11.973
Come on, get out of here.
Go now. I've got work to do!

01:43:12.103 --> 01:43:14.010
Just go to her house.

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.269
Thank you for your time.

01:43:16.399 --> 01:43:17.684
Come back again.

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:19.432
Hey.

01:43:20.528 --> 01:43:23.565
Don't sweat it, young man.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.611
The world's always
been crazy anyway.

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:41.879
Next stop hamamatsucho.

01:43:42.633 --> 01:43:44.669
- You're super positive.
- You think?

01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:46.883
- Looking forward to the picnic.
- Yeah!

01:43:57.773 --> 01:44:00.557
It was under the sea.

01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:06.020
The world's always been crazy.

01:44:08.701 --> 01:44:12.989
