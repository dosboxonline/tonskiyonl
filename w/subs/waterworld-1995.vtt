00:44.336 --> 00:46.463
The future:

00:46.547 --> 00:48.924
The polar ice caps
have melted,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.718
covering the Earth
with water.

00:51.802 --> 00:56.223
Those who survived
have adapted...

00:56.265 --> 00:58.225
to a new world.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.773
I didn't board you.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.984
I wouldn't do that.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.111
You were down there a long time.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.488
The hull's busted.

05:21.989 --> 05:26.952
Holes so big, there's room to breathe.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.372
Bad luck, English.

05:30.414 --> 05:35.002
But the Slavers are producing
a good grade of poxy these days.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.921
Cost you a handful of dirt...
or maybe that wind chime.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.758
- What are you doin' here?
- Just waiting.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.887
Take your hand
off the sail.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.389
Take it off!

05:47.472 --> 05:51.351
I've seen your boat before.
Haven't seen you.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.147
Took it legal.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.108
Previous owner was dead on the tiller
when I found it.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.111
You had another hour
before I traded up again.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.780
Just improving my means.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.618
- Well, I owe you then.
- No, thanks.

06:07.701 --> 06:12.915
I got all the supplies I need.
Just came from an atoll.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.959
Eight days east,
if you're interested.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.798
- Two drifters meet,
something needs to be exchanged.
- I know the code.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.510
But I'll give you this one
for free.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.013
Nothing's free
in Waterworld.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.681
Ha-ha. Yeah.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.278
Smokers.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.364
Just enough wind
to get away clean.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.286
Forget the bag.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.127
It's not worth it. You'll never
make it with your sails down.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.713
Hey!

07:13.600 --> 07:15.811
What can I say?

07:35.956 --> 07:39.293
- Joe, he's goin' for it.
- What the hell?

07:44.339 --> 07:46.383
Never seen that before.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.472
Here we go! Go!
Drive! Drive!

07:57.603 --> 08:00.564
Faster! Faster! Whoo!

08:21.418 --> 08:23.712
Come on! He's gonna get it!
He's gonna get it!

08:43.398 --> 08:45.651
- Pick her up!
- Get it! Get it!

09:14.596 --> 09:17.182
Oh, no!

10:03.478 --> 10:06.356
Inbound!
Straight out from the gates.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.784
English.

10:20.454 --> 10:24.499
Flag's down, drifter.
We got enough traders.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.849
Dirt.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.851
Open the gates!

11:24.726 --> 11:27.563
Bones to berries.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.731
Veins to vine.

11:29.815 --> 11:34.027
These tendons to trees.
This blood to brine.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.737
Too old she was.

11:35.821 --> 11:40.409
This woman does leave us,
recycled and enshrined...

11:40.450 --> 11:43.328
in the presence
of Him who leads us.

12:01.430 --> 12:05.934
- What is that?

12:10.439 --> 12:12.816
You know me?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.818
I know what you are.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.697
Good. Then you know if you
look for trouble while you're here,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.824
you'll find more
than you can handle.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.703
You got two hours.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.249
I'll only need one.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.929
He's comin' over here.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.311
- Me.
- You each get one...

12:49.353 --> 12:51.897
if everything's here
when I get back.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.574
- Pure dirt.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.035
3.2 kilos.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.249
How'd you come by
so much of it?

13:10.332 --> 13:13.085
Another atoll
30 horizons west of here.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.295
Where'd they get it?

13:15.337 --> 13:18.590
- They didn't say.
- We heard about that place...

13:18.674 --> 13:21.218
that they was all killed.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.222
- That's why they didn't say.
- Smokers?

13:25.305 --> 13:28.517
Maybe Smokers,
maybe Slavers.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.771
So what's the word?
We tradin' or not?

13:32.855 --> 13:37.568
We'll tally it
like, uh, pure hydro.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.116
Works out to... 62 chits.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.996
I want twice that.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.879
- I just want one sip of hydro!
- No, not 'til you tell me.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.174
She got inkings on her back.
I seen her.

14:00.215 --> 14:03.427
They say if you read
the marks on the child,

14:03.510 --> 14:06.972
they'll lead ya
all the way to Dryland.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.142
- Dryland's a myth.
- Some still believe.

14:10.225 --> 14:13.312
They say the Smokers
even got an eye out for her.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.066
Well, then, we'd better
keep it to ourselves.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.676
- Help you?
- Yeah.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.012
- Where's the store?
- You found it.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.728
You don't have much.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.607
You the man
with the dirt?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.668
Skoal.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.882
- One more.
- Make it two.

15:23.966 --> 15:27.719
A man this rich will buy
for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.138
One.

15:32.599 --> 15:36.436
That's an interesting
pair of boots you got.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.647
- Trade?
- No.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.816
Shame.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.492
Enola.
Hey, what are you doing?

15:50.576 --> 15:54.371
- No, you can't do that.
- I need another piece.
I want to draw some more.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.082
I'll get it to you.
Just stay in the back.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.294
With all those chits,
you could order up a bath.

16:00.335 --> 16:03.005
- Have you ever had a freshwater bath?
- Why are you talkin' to me?

16:03.046 --> 16:05.007
Just being friendly.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.598
- Is that a tomato plant?
- Yeah.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.850
You have a keen eye.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.019
Saw one in a picture.
How much?

16:23.233 --> 16:25.194
Half your chits.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.833
- I'll take them too.
- Take what?

16:39.875 --> 16:42.920
- You bought everything.
- I'll take them shelves.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.884
So, what did you see out there
in your 15 months?

16:48.967 --> 16:51.470
- Such as?
- An end to all this water.

16:51.553 --> 16:55.057
Askin' the wrong person.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.142
- The one they buried today?
- Uh-huh?

16:57.226 --> 16:59.728
She found the only end there is.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.859
I've got a proposition
for you, Mariner.

17:08.737 --> 17:13.742
- I'm not staying.
- We're not asking you to.
All we want is your seed.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.954
We can look to our own
for impregnation,

17:18.038 --> 17:23.417
but too much of that sort of thing
gets... undesirable.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.463
When she's pregnant,
you go on your way...

17:26.547 --> 17:29.132
with all the supplies
you need.

17:29.216 --> 17:33.220
You don't have anything.
You're dying.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.603
No man stays out that long
and turns down a woman.

17:42.938 --> 17:47.192
- He's hiding something.
- Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

17:57.578 --> 18:00.873
When the elders say so,
you can leave,

18:00.956 --> 18:02.875
and not before.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.979
Gills.

18:25.022 --> 18:29.067
- Mutation!
- He's a mutant!

18:29.151 --> 18:31.904
My hand!

18:47.169 --> 18:49.505
Throw the nets!

19:21.078 --> 19:23.997
By what right...

19:25.415 --> 19:28.293
You pay me to keep the peace.

19:28.377 --> 19:30.295
This isn't it.

19:30.379 --> 19:33.799
- He has killed one of ours.
- He was defending himself.

19:33.882 --> 19:37.594
- He needs to be destroyed!
- Kill him. Let's kill him.
- That may be,

19:37.678 --> 19:40.973
but not here
and not like this.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.923
What is it?

20:15.007 --> 20:16.967
Damn.

20:18.177 --> 20:21.388
It's tied.
I can't get it off.

20:24.892 --> 20:28.145
Open the gate.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.804
Is it a map?

21:02.846 --> 21:06.517
- You'd tell me if you knew,
wouldn't you, Enola?
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.898
- What are you drawing?
- I don't know.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.779
Helen, look. Look at
the prodigal child's latest vision.

21:24.493 --> 21:29.581
- How soon before we can leave?
- I don't have any idea yet
where we can go.

21:29.665 --> 21:33.001
I haven't figured out
the tattoo on her back.

21:33.043 --> 21:36.672
I'm a stupid man.
The answer's right there.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.757
It's just beyond me.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.887
Maybe he knows.

21:52.563 --> 21:57.067
Oh, yes, I see.
They are webbed.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.904
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten digits. That's wonderful.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.991
They tell me, too,
that you have gills.

22:04.032 --> 22:08.704
Isotropic gills. Are they merely
vestigial or are they functional now?

22:08.745 --> 22:12.291
My name is Gregor. I've just come
to pay you a little vi... vi...

22:13.876 --> 22:17.129
Oh, my God.

22:17.212 --> 22:20.257
I'm sorry.
I'm not laughing at you.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.385
I'm excited. Your gills.
They're functional.

22:23.468 --> 22:27.097
Icthyus sapien.
You can breathe in the water.

22:27.181 --> 22:31.059
How deep can you go?
Look, I'm only here...

22:31.101 --> 22:33.729
because I want to learn
more about you.

22:38.817 --> 22:42.196
You don't like humans
very much, do you?

22:42.237 --> 22:45.866
I can't say that I blame you.
But tell me:

22:45.908 --> 22:49.536
- Are all of your kind as
bad-tempered as you are?

22:52.122 --> 22:54.583
- I have no "kind."
- Oh, fish rot.

22:54.666 --> 22:58.086
I'd be surprised if there
weren't others, and if there aren't,

22:58.128 --> 23:01.548
there will be eventually.

23:01.590 --> 23:04.927
Anyway, I've come here
because I need to ask you a question.

23:05.010 --> 23:08.931
Where... Where did
your dirt come from?

23:09.014 --> 23:11.433
Is it from Dryland?

23:11.475 --> 23:13.602
Do you know what this is?

23:15.562 --> 23:17.940
The ancients... They did something
terrible, didn't they?

23:18.023 --> 23:21.777
To cause all this water.
Hundreds... Hundreds of years ago.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.905
If I tell you,
will you open this lock?

23:27.407 --> 23:30.285
I haven't a key.

23:30.327 --> 23:33.080
- There's a mooring cleat down there.
- What?

23:33.121 --> 23:36.208
- Good as any key.
- A mooring cleat?

23:38.293 --> 23:41.046
I won't hurt anyone.
I'll just leave.

23:42.381 --> 23:45.676
- I'll be right back.
- Gregor!

23:45.759 --> 23:47.719
What's your business there?

23:47.803 --> 23:49.930
- Move along!
- I'm not a brave man.

23:49.972 --> 23:54.309
If you know anything about Dryland,
please tell me. Please!

23:55.644 --> 23:57.563
Don't let it die with you.

23:57.646 --> 24:00.357
No, no, no, no.
Stop!

24:00.440 --> 24:04.111
Gregor! Move along!

24:38.979 --> 24:44.193
After considerable deliberation
of the evidence at hand,

24:44.234 --> 24:47.696
it is our decision
that this mute-o...

24:47.779 --> 24:51.033
does, indeed,
constitute a threat.

24:51.074 --> 24:54.036
Therefore, in the interest
of public safety,

24:54.119 --> 24:57.664
he is hereby sentenced
to be recycled...

24:57.706 --> 25:00.584
in the customary fashion.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.544
Proceed.

25:08.467 --> 25:11.303
I'm sorry.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.226
Bones to berries.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.895
Veins to vines.

25:19.937 --> 25:23.732
His tendons to trees.
His blood to brine.

25:23.774 --> 25:26.902
Too strange for life he was.

25:26.944 --> 25:31.406
This mute-o now does leave us,

25:31.490 --> 25:34.326
recycled and entombed,

25:34.743 --> 25:37.621
in the presence
of Him who leads us.

25:47.589 --> 25:52.302
Smokers!
Dead out of the sun!

25:55.472 --> 25:58.934
To your posts!

26:13.615 --> 26:16.535
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:26.879 --> 26:29.631
- Kill!
- There!

26:39.641 --> 26:42.477
We are safe
behind these walls.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.939
- Aren't we?

26:51.778 --> 26:54.865
- Let me out!

26:56.533 --> 26:58.869
Let me out!
I'll fight!

27:28.315 --> 27:30.234
Give me the key
to the city now.

27:34.071 --> 27:36.406
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

27:39.076 --> 27:41.995
Floor it!
Floor it! Floor it!

28:03.225 --> 28:05.561
Swab it! Swab it!

28:05.644 --> 28:09.314
Goddamn! More ammo!

28:23.704 --> 28:25.747
Break down the door!

28:29.543 --> 28:32.629
- My God!

28:32.713 --> 28:35.090
Ha!

28:37.301 --> 28:40.304
We'll have this atoll
in no time.

28:43.599 --> 28:45.559
Crank it!
Crank it!

28:49.605 --> 28:51.857
Look!

29:10.542 --> 29:12.753
Look out!

29:35.275 --> 29:37.194
Oh, no!

29:48.121 --> 29:50.916
You get that goin'!
Fill 'em up!

30:28.871 --> 30:32.207
- Helen, come quickly!

30:32.291 --> 30:34.459
Helen!

31:02.446 --> 31:05.908
You're not supposed to go yet!

31:05.949 --> 31:08.327
Infernal machine!

31:11.830 --> 31:14.583
Gregor. Gregor, wait!

31:14.666 --> 31:18.003
Helen, I tried. There was an accident.
I can't make it stop. Hurry!

31:18.086 --> 31:21.507
You can make it if you try. Run!
Up those stairs. Run! Quickly!

31:21.590 --> 31:25.802
- Wait! Wait!
- I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly!

31:25.886 --> 31:28.889
- Throw the rope now. Run, Enola.
- Slow down! Wait!

31:28.931 --> 31:32.893
- Throw the rope. No! No!
- Wait!

31:34.436 --> 31:36.605
- Gregor, don't leave us!
- Oh, no!

31:36.688 --> 31:38.941
I'm sorry!
It was an accident!

31:43.320 --> 31:47.074
Helen! Enola!
Helen, I'm sorry!

31:56.083 --> 31:59.461
Shoot him.
Shoot him.

32:26.238 --> 32:29.700
If I let you out of here,
you're taking us with you.

32:30.993 --> 32:32.995
Sure.

32:34.663 --> 32:36.915
Enola, get down.

32:38.584 --> 32:40.794
Here. Get over here.
Get down.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.796
Hurry!
Come on!

32:45.757 --> 32:48.093
Get the gate.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.711
Run!

33:47.069 --> 33:48.987
Hurry up!

33:49.071 --> 33:50.948
Kamikazes. Come on!

34:19.643 --> 34:21.645
That made a hole.

34:33.282 --> 34:36.784
Find her!
Get the girl!

34:41.873 --> 34:43.958
There!

34:50.924 --> 34:54.219
Go get that guy!
Go! Kill him!

34:58.307 --> 35:00.726
- Wow!
- Enola!

35:11.153 --> 35:14.198
- You're too slow!
- Run to the other side.

35:16.074 --> 35:19.203
- Come on!

35:22.414 --> 35:26.502
- Grab on! Hold on, hold on.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.591
I'm stuck!
I can't make it through!

35:32.674 --> 35:35.427
- Let her go!

35:36.512 --> 35:38.430
Just drop her!

35:53.237 --> 35:57.032
Turn the wheel.
The wheel! Turn it!

35:59.993 --> 36:02.955
That! Come on! Push it!

36:03.038 --> 36:05.707
- I am!
- Hurry! Now pull!

36:05.749 --> 36:09.670
Push it! Push it hard!
Push it hard!

36:09.711 --> 36:12.756
Okay, okay! Now pull this!
Pull this!

36:12.840 --> 36:16.301
Pull! Pull it!
Hurry!

36:26.478 --> 36:29.731
- Enola, jump.

36:32.067 --> 36:34.486
- Look at me. Jump! Now!
- Okay!

36:51.253 --> 36:56.091
Well, excuse me! Did I say anybody
could leave before the battle was over?

36:56.175 --> 36:58.093
- Did I?
- No! No!

36:58.177 --> 37:00.596
Well, do somethin'.
I hate sails.

37:09.897 --> 37:13.108
Hey! Can you steer?

37:13.192 --> 37:15.110
Can I trust you?

37:49.645 --> 37:53.232
Answer me this, somebody.
Why is that boat still firin'?

37:54.316 --> 37:56.985
- What's that cousin's name?
- Chuck.

37:57.027 --> 38:01.240
- Hey, Chuck!
- He's pulling him right into us.

38:01.323 --> 38:05.702
Maybe he doesn't answer to "Chuck."
Call him "Charles." Charles!

38:06.828 --> 38:10.874
Stop him! Stop him!

38:18.382 --> 38:20.384
Charles!

38:22.219 --> 38:24.179
Adios, cousins.

39:10.058 --> 39:12.227
She's here somewhere.
Keep lookin'.

39:12.311 --> 39:14.897
Stop it!

39:24.323 --> 39:29.912
- What you got?
- Couple of heartbeats over there.
Aren't sayin' much.

39:29.995 --> 39:34.082
If you'll notice the arterial
nature of the blood comin'
from the hole in my head,

39:34.124 --> 39:38.462
you can assume that we're
all havin' a real lousy day.

39:38.545 --> 39:42.382
So here it is: I need to know
about that tattooed girl.

39:43.926 --> 39:46.261
First one that
tells me lives.

39:46.303 --> 39:51.099
- I saw a girl. I saw, I saw...
- It was... Sh-She had
a big tattoo on her.

39:53.393 --> 39:56.271
You won.
Start over.

39:56.355 --> 39:58.482
I saw a girl.
I'm not sure,

39:58.565 --> 40:03.529
but I think she got on that boat
with three hulls.

40:03.612 --> 40:07.950
- The boat that cost me
a thousand G's of go-juice?
- Yeah, the mute-o's boat.

40:08.033 --> 40:11.954
- Mute-o?
- Yeah. He got these slits here.

40:11.995 --> 40:15.374
Like...
Like fish gills.

40:15.457 --> 40:17.709
He wasn't really a man.

40:17.793 --> 40:20.462
A fluke of evolution.

40:22.005 --> 40:24.383
Oh, I'm sorry.
A fluke of, uh...

40:24.466 --> 40:26.844
- Evolution.
- I know!

40:26.927 --> 40:30.806
- No! No, you said
you wouldn't kill me!
- Did I say that?

40:30.848 --> 40:33.976
- Witnesses, anybody, did I?
- Yes, yes, yes! You said...

40:34.059 --> 40:36.603
- You said it.
- Oh, I may have.

40:38.647 --> 40:40.566
I may have.

40:47.114 --> 40:49.366
We get to the 'Deez,

40:50.659 --> 40:53.954
tank up that sky boat;
send it out on patrol.

40:55.205 --> 40:57.916
We gotta keep an eye out...

40:58.000 --> 41:00.377
for that ichthy-freak.

41:24.151 --> 41:26.195
You been there, haven't you?

41:31.033 --> 41:33.619
Dryland?

41:33.702 --> 41:35.871
You know where it is.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.832
Yeah, I know where it is.

41:41.919 --> 41:44.588
And, uh... And we're going?

41:45.714 --> 41:47.674
You and I are.

41:49.218 --> 41:52.387
The kid we gotta pitch
over the side.

41:54.223 --> 41:58.227
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.812
I'm takin' on water.

42:00.896 --> 42:04.316
I'd be lucky to get
half a hydro ration out of that.

42:04.399 --> 42:08.028
You know...
I said I won't drink.

42:08.070 --> 42:10.656
For 12 days?

42:12.241 --> 42:15.160
No. It's better
one of you dies now...

42:15.244 --> 42:17.287
than both of you die slow.

42:17.371 --> 42:19.581
Wait. Wait.

42:19.623 --> 42:22.084
We saved your life.
We got you out.

42:22.167 --> 42:26.255
No, you got me out so you
could get out. We're even.

42:26.338 --> 42:28.382
She can cook.
She can fish.

42:28.423 --> 42:30.717
- So can I.
- Then take my necklace.
Take my necklace.

42:30.759 --> 42:33.053
- I got better ones below.
- No, look!

42:33.095 --> 42:35.931
Oh.

42:36.014 --> 42:39.101
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

42:39.184 --> 42:42.354
I can understand
why you would want to.

42:42.437 --> 42:44.439
But she's a child.

42:55.450 --> 42:57.870
Is there something else then?

43:03.292 --> 43:05.878
Enola! Go below.

43:07.004 --> 43:08.964
Enola.

43:19.308 --> 43:22.644
Yeah. You said so yourself.

43:24.521 --> 43:27.274
Been out there a long time.

44:12.945 --> 44:15.989
Couple hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

44:16.031 --> 44:19.451
- We're not like that.
- You all are.

44:25.040 --> 44:28.335
Know what I was really thinkin'?

44:28.377 --> 44:31.547
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

44:32.881 --> 44:35.425
You got nothin' I need.

44:51.358 --> 44:53.735
You're taking us to Dryland.

44:58.073 --> 45:00.909
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

45:00.951 --> 45:04.413
- Believe me. I'm not
the one to start on.
- Both of us!

45:09.918 --> 45:12.504
How long you plan
to hold that on me?

45:12.588 --> 45:14.756
As long as it takes.

45:17.301 --> 45:20.345
- Okay.
- No!

45:22.014 --> 45:25.142
Let me out of here!

45:25.225 --> 45:29.062
Where the hell are you?
Don't you touch my child.

45:29.104 --> 45:31.064
Come here!

46:19.279 --> 46:21.990
Okay, now don't move, okay?
There.

46:22.074 --> 46:25.494
Ohh. Oh, lookin'
real good, yeah.

46:25.536 --> 46:27.871
There. There.

46:27.955 --> 46:29.873
All done.

46:29.957 --> 46:32.960
Now, there may be some small problem
in depth perception.

46:33.001 --> 46:35.879
Well, it better not
screw up my short game.

46:38.340 --> 46:40.759
- Well?
- Looks good. I like it. Yeah.

46:40.843 --> 46:43.929
- I like it better than your real eye.
- Much better.

46:44.012 --> 46:47.516
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.
- Looks like shit.

46:47.599 --> 46:50.519
That's why I love children.
No guile.

46:54.815 --> 46:58.277
It does look like shit.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.279
And it feels like cold shit!

47:00.362 --> 47:02.865
Deacon? What...

47:04.241 --> 47:07.369
I'm sorry. L-lt's just that
there's a problem in the pit.

47:07.411 --> 47:09.371
Maybe you should come.

47:14.877 --> 47:18.213
- Let's drive.

47:23.886 --> 47:27.556
The pit. Don't bother
with the scenic route.

47:27.598 --> 47:29.558
Drive!

47:30.684 --> 47:32.895
Hey, it's drivin' better.

47:44.865 --> 47:47.117
Get off!

47:48.202 --> 47:50.579
Get over there.
Get out of the way.

47:50.662 --> 47:52.789
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.

47:56.043 --> 47:59.463
You guys are great.
Bless all you cousins over there.

47:59.546 --> 48:04.009
Keep up the good work.
Growth is progress. Growth is progress.

48:04.092 --> 48:08.764
Somebody!
Hey, up there!

48:08.805 --> 48:10.766
Take it off!

48:13.227 --> 48:16.563
- Yes.
- Your Deaconship.

48:16.605 --> 48:20.567
Hello. Good morning.
Or night,

48:20.609 --> 48:23.153
whichever the case may be.

48:23.237 --> 48:26.114
- What is it? I'm a busy man.
- I thought you should know.

48:26.156 --> 48:28.825
We're down to exactly...

48:28.909 --> 48:32.913
four feet, nine inches
of black stuff.

48:34.498 --> 48:39.169
- Thank you, sir.

48:39.253 --> 48:42.130
- How many G's is that after refinin'?
- Maybe three refuelers.

48:42.172 --> 48:45.801
- We'll burn through that in two lunars.
- Sweet Joe!

48:45.843 --> 48:49.471
Will somebody please tell me
what's happened to this place?

48:49.513 --> 48:51.598
We outgrowed it.

48:51.640 --> 48:55.519
All right, the only thing
that is important is the tattooed girl.

48:55.602 --> 48:58.981
We don't spare any go-juice
findin' her.

48:59.064 --> 49:02.150
We don't waste it anywhere else.
You cancel all those tractor pulls...

49:02.234 --> 49:04.111
and all that stuff
until later.

49:04.152 --> 49:06.154
You got it?

49:07.656 --> 49:10.492
Dryland is the mother lode.

49:10.576 --> 49:12.703
On your toes.

49:14.162 --> 49:16.081
Excellent.

49:45.569 --> 49:48.864
- Hi.
- Move.

49:48.947 --> 49:51.325
Enola!
Enola, come here!

49:53.619 --> 49:55.537
Come on!

49:57.539 --> 49:59.499
Enola, come over here.

50:13.055 --> 50:14.806
Hey!

50:17.059 --> 50:21.605
- What are ya doin'?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

50:25.734 --> 50:28.904
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

50:28.946 --> 50:31.657
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

50:31.740 --> 50:35.118
- I drew it for you.
- You don't draw on anything.
You understand?

50:40.707 --> 50:42.626
What...

50:44.878 --> 50:47.840
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

50:47.923 --> 50:50.717
You take up space
and you slow me down.

50:54.638 --> 50:57.266
You know, she's just a little girl.

50:57.349 --> 51:00.477
- She doesn't know your rules.
- You wanna stay?

51:00.561 --> 51:02.479
You teach her.

51:21.957 --> 51:24.126
Enola, what'd I tell you?

51:29.423 --> 51:31.800
You're not so tough.
You know that?

51:36.138 --> 51:38.056
How many people
have you killed?

51:40.851 --> 51:43.729
Ten? Twenty?

51:45.689 --> 51:50.319
- You talk a lot.
- I talk a lot 'cause
you don't talk at all.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.321
Now how many?

51:54.156 --> 51:57.868
- Including little girls?
- I'm not afraid of you.

52:01.747 --> 52:05.000
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly
if you cut your hair.

52:08.378 --> 52:11.006
In fact, you talk all the time.

52:11.089 --> 52:13.175
- It's like a storm
when you're around.
- Enola!

52:13.258 --> 52:15.844
Hey! What are you doing?

52:15.928 --> 52:19.056
- Helen!
- You bastard!
She can't swim!

52:19.139 --> 52:22.017
Help me! Helen!

52:23.685 --> 52:25.646
Helen, help me!

52:25.687 --> 52:28.315
Helen!

52:28.357 --> 52:30.400
Helen, help me!

52:38.909 --> 52:41.578
Helen! Helen!

52:41.662 --> 52:44.206
Hold on!

52:44.248 --> 52:46.667
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

52:47.751 --> 52:51.755
Oh, please, come back.
Please!

52:51.839 --> 52:55.342
Please! Oh, please!

53:00.138 --> 53:02.724
Hey!

53:04.309 --> 53:06.687
Hold on.
Okay, almost...

53:08.230 --> 53:10.190
there.

53:20.242 --> 53:21.493
Thanks. I swear,

53:22.786 --> 53:25.372
if you ever touch her again...

53:25.414 --> 53:27.583
You son of a bitch.
Look at me.

53:27.624 --> 53:30.210
You will go to bed that night,
and you will never wake up.

53:30.252 --> 53:32.588
- Shut up.
- What?

53:32.629 --> 53:35.591
- Smokers?
- Yeah.

53:35.674 --> 53:37.926
Can't we outrun them?

53:38.010 --> 53:41.972
- Not with my sail down.

54:00.115 --> 54:04.161
- What are you thinkin' about?
- That's a nice touch.

54:04.244 --> 54:06.163
That's them.

54:12.336 --> 54:15.214
Don't hit the kid.

54:29.645 --> 54:32.523
Hey!

54:37.486 --> 54:39.571
Coward!

54:47.788 --> 54:50.123
Fuck!

55:17.568 --> 55:20.362
No!

55:41.216 --> 55:43.135
Cut it!

55:51.476 --> 55:54.229
Come on! Come on!

56:25.969 --> 56:29.223
All right. Okay.

57:29.157 --> 57:32.411
Oh, I'm really sorry.

57:32.494 --> 57:35.664
I'm sorry.
But you didn't give me much choice.

57:35.706 --> 57:38.667
Oh, I know.

57:38.750 --> 57:41.503
But you ran away.
L... What?

57:41.545 --> 57:45.382
What are you do...
No! Please, no! No!

57:54.474 --> 57:58.770
Don't ever touch
anything on my boat again.

58:02.191 --> 58:04.193
She said she was sorry!

58:08.197 --> 58:10.991
That means you're supposed
to say something back!

58:34.223 --> 58:36.225
- Did you say somethin'?
- Mm-mmm.

58:59.998 --> 59:02.167
The child...
did he have the girl with him?

59:02.209 --> 59:04.503
- Uh-huh.
- Seems to me if we launch now,

59:04.586 --> 59:06.713
we can cut him down
just about here.

59:08.549 --> 59:11.927
- If he doesn't change course.
- Ah, it's not likely.

59:12.010 --> 59:15.639
He's a wily one,
that ichthy-demon.

59:15.681 --> 59:18.308
Yeah, if he knows
he's been spotted,

59:18.350 --> 59:22.187
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

59:22.229 --> 59:25.816
which is exactly why
he'll keep his heading.

59:25.858 --> 59:29.111
The important question is,
where's he heading?

59:29.194 --> 59:32.739
And does he know
how precious his cargo is?

59:32.823 --> 59:37.202
I say that he's headed here,
and we take him here.

59:48.338 --> 59:50.549
- Drifter?
- Mm-hmm.

59:50.632 --> 59:52.551
Are we gonna stop?

59:52.634 --> 59:54.553
- Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

59:54.636 --> 59:56.722
I thought you all
stopped for each other.

01:00:02.019 --> 01:00:04.688
Well... maybe he has some food!

01:00:08.192 --> 01:00:10.819
Don't find many who follow
the rules anymore.

01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:13.697
Well, make it quick.
What's your business?

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.662
Trade.

01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.583
You got any resin?

01:00:27.127 --> 01:00:31.256
Resin? He's gotta be out of
his mind. He's out of his mind.
I don't have any resin.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.800
- You been outwater
a long time, haven't you?

01:00:35.636 --> 01:00:38.055
Must be jokin' me, man.
Resin! You don't got enough.

01:00:38.138 --> 01:00:40.349
How 'bout food?

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:42.434
Could you say that again, please?

01:00:42.518 --> 01:00:45.437
- How 'bout food?
- Ah, yeah, food.

01:00:45.521 --> 01:00:48.023
Yeah, that'd be good, eh?

01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:51.068
I haven't eaten in, well,
you know, forever.

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:54.780
Which one of you two is a cook?

01:00:54.863 --> 01:00:58.534
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress.

01:00:58.617 --> 01:01:00.619
Like you said,
I don't have much.

01:01:00.702 --> 01:01:03.914
Now listen, eh?
Let's see. What do I have to do?

01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:07.835
We can start with that wee orchard
you got over there.

01:01:07.876 --> 01:01:12.756
All right, hold it there.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.260
- We can talk.
- Fair enough.

01:01:21.223 --> 01:01:23.600
It's a nice rod, isn't it?

01:01:23.684 --> 01:01:26.728
I like that rod.
It's a nice rod.

01:01:33.068 --> 01:01:35.863
Got yourself a wee harem
goin' here now, do ya?

01:01:42.452 --> 01:01:44.580
What you want for the women?

01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:47.040
We're not for sale.

01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:49.793
Not for sale?
There's no such thing as not for sale.

01:01:49.877 --> 01:01:52.129
"Not for sale"!
Not for sale, eh?

01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:57.634
- Are they a pair or would you
consider sellin' 'em separate?
- No.

01:01:57.718 --> 01:02:01.722
Our business is done here unless you got
some resin for sale you can part with.

01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:03.724
I told you once already,
I don't have it.

01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:06.560
I-I-I don't have it.
Don't have it. Don't have it.

01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:10.772
Haven't seen neither for trade
in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:16.278
I do have somethin' that'll
make you change your mind.

01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:21.200
Somethin' that you can't pass on.

01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:25.579
I took it off
an Atoller refugee camp.

01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:27.581
The life savings
of the entire clan.

01:02:35.547 --> 01:02:38.550
Paper.

01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:44.139
It's paper. Have you ever
seen paper? Look at it.

01:02:44.181 --> 01:02:46.141
Smell it.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.978
I been savin' it
for a special trade.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:55.734
Don't you do it.

01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:58.695
You know, maybe I'm talkin'
to the wrong person here.

01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:00.948
Whose boat is this?
Is it your boat or your boat?

01:03:00.989 --> 01:03:04.660
No. No, it's his boat.
But he doesn't own us.

01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.669
Half an hour.

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:17.297
Out of his mind somethin' there.

01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:21.343
I got two pages in here, man!
I mean, I'd get half a dozen
girls with this, you know.

01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:24.054
Half an hour.

01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:26.265
- You tradin' or not?
- Don't.

01:03:26.348 --> 01:03:28.308
Shut up.

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:31.979
Okay.

01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:35.858
Forty-five minutes
with the wee one right there.

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:38.360
I like to do the talkin',
if you know what I mean.

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:42.030
No!

01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:46.159
Fair. Come, come,
come, come, come!

01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:48.579
No. My boat.

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:53.917
- Fair enough. Fair enough.
Good, good, good. Aye.
- Helen.

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:57.546
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.803
It's been a while for me now.

01:04:46.887 --> 01:04:50.474
Guess it's been
more than a while, actually.

01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:58.607
I've only got half an hour.
Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour...

01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:01.610
Great, great, great...

01:05:01.693 --> 01:05:06.448
Ooh! You're so beautiful.
Aye! Anyone ever told you that?

01:05:06.532 --> 01:05:09.451
Give me that. What are you doin'?
It's just a game.

01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:15.832
Oh, I, um... I, uh...
We was just playin'.

01:05:18.961 --> 01:05:21.004
The trade's off.

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:22.965
I changed my mind.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:27.010
Well, um... Well,
you can't do that.

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:29.555
I mean, a deal's a deal, eh?

01:05:29.638 --> 01:05:31.473
I just did.

01:05:31.974 --> 01:05:33.767
Hey!

01:05:33.809 --> 01:05:38.355
She's mine. Aye. No. No, no
I own her. But... No.

01:05:38.438 --> 01:05:41.316
- Go on.
- Get, get, get.
Go, go, go. Good, good.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.821
But don't go too far now.
This won't take but a minute.

01:05:50.909 --> 01:05:56.290
I hate this boat.
I hate this boat!

01:05:56.331 --> 01:05:59.042
You bastard.

01:06:03.255 --> 01:06:08.177
You... You're pretty stingy for a man
who's got everything, aren't ya now?

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:14.266
Oh-h-h. Ohh.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.987
Ah, you bastard!

01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:40.417
Where's me boat?

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.837
Where's me boat?

01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:53.055
Help me to me boat.

01:06:54.598 --> 01:06:56.558
Ow! Me boat.

01:06:58.727 --> 01:07:00.604
Me boat.

01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:31.510
What the... No!

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:36.223
Never catch anything
with this. It's useless.

01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:46.567
Look, I'm sorry.
You were right about the pole.

01:07:47.901 --> 01:07:50.362
You were right,
but we have to eat.

01:07:56.076 --> 01:07:58.078
Now I know
you can hear me!

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.623
Now we can fish for ourselves.
You show us what to do.

01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:03.959
You must know how.
Even you gotta eat!

01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:06.378
You just sit there.

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:32.946
- What...
- I don't know.

01:09:08.774 --> 01:09:10.692
Happy now?

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:30.796
You don't like my singing,
do you?

01:09:33.715 --> 01:09:37.761
Helen says you don't like my singing
'cause you can't sing.

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:46.562
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:51.899
The sound of the world.

01:09:56.071 --> 01:09:58.991
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud,

01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:00.993
and you're movin' around
all the time.

01:10:01.076 --> 01:10:03.829
Try sittin' still.

01:10:03.912 --> 01:10:06.915
Eyeball?

01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:23.348
I wish I had feet like his.

01:10:26.435 --> 01:10:28.312
Then maybe I could swim.

01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:30.063
Enola.

01:10:33.734 --> 01:10:35.819
Sorry.

01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:42.993
Never met a person
couldn't swim before.

01:10:45.787 --> 01:10:48.624
I can't.

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:52.169
People say I was weird.

01:10:52.252 --> 01:10:54.171
Maybe they were right.

01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:00.135
Maybe they were right
about you too.

01:11:27.996 --> 01:11:29.957
Enola wanted to give you this.

01:11:34.253 --> 01:11:36.880
And this.

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:41.134
She won't take it again.

01:11:47.558 --> 01:11:50.519
You don't look much like her.

01:11:50.561 --> 01:11:54.606
- Well, I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.
- You act like it.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.571
What are those marks
on her back?

01:12:00.654 --> 01:12:03.323
Nothing.
They're just fanciful things.

01:12:04.616 --> 01:12:08.745
- Like what she draws?
- She draws what she sees.

01:12:08.829 --> 01:12:11.665
She's like a mirror.

01:12:11.707 --> 01:12:13.792
People on the atoll
thought she was a...

01:12:15.544 --> 01:12:18.297
Freak?

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.757
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:22.801
I just thought
she was special.

01:12:30.517 --> 01:12:34.313
I'm not givin' it
to her. It's just...

01:12:34.396 --> 01:12:36.148
A loan.

01:12:36.231 --> 01:12:39.193
Yeah. I'm not
givin' it to her.

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:48.202
Is Dryland beautiful?

01:12:49.745 --> 01:12:52.080
You'll see.

01:13:17.856 --> 01:13:20.275
Enola?

01:13:20.359 --> 01:13:22.361
Enola, what are you doing?

01:13:22.444 --> 01:13:25.864
- Those monsters'll kill her!
- No, they're asleep now.

01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:31.036
Hands around my neck.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.541
Let the water tell your arms
and legs how to move.

01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:37.793
We're goin' down.
Hold your breath.

01:15:17.309 --> 01:15:20.312
- What is it?
- What is it?

01:15:22.397 --> 01:15:24.483
Barter outpost.

01:15:24.566 --> 01:15:26.527
You said we'd get
to Dryland today.

01:15:26.568 --> 01:15:29.738
Today. Tomorrow.
What's it matter?

01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:33.283
I need resin.

01:15:42.918 --> 01:15:48.340
- What is that?
- It's PortuGreek. Their own language.

01:15:51.301 --> 01:15:53.637
Or so I thought.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.332
Ah.

01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:25.752
There's my girl. Yeah.

01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:29.464
Howdy, darlin'.
Come on in here now.

01:16:58.994 --> 01:17:01.371
- What's going on?
- Smokers.

01:17:04.791 --> 01:17:06.710
What the hell?

01:17:10.297 --> 01:17:13.217
He's spotted us.
Sound it!

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.137
Sound it! Sound it!
Sound it! Sound it!

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:30.776
Yahoo!

01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:41.662
Enola!

01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:55.175
Starboard side! Now!

01:17:56.218 --> 01:17:58.178
Get in the chair!

01:18:04.518 --> 01:18:07.396
Watch it.
He's clearin' the net.

01:18:18.782 --> 01:18:20.951
Go to the helm.

01:18:22.744 --> 01:18:25.122
- Get the centerboard!
- Centerboard?

01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:27.958
What centerboard?
I don't know what to do!

01:18:30.586 --> 01:18:32.629
It's too late.
Over here!

01:18:52.232 --> 01:18:54.193
No!

01:19:10.459 --> 01:19:15.339
Gimme that rifle.
Boy, if you wanna do somethin' right,

01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:18.091
you've got to do it yourself.

01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:20.093
All right.

01:19:26.642 --> 01:19:28.602
- I winged him.
- I say we load...

01:19:28.644 --> 01:19:31.813
all the go-juice onto one boat
and run the freak down.

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:35.192
You can't catch him in ten boats,
and you wanna send just one?

01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:37.903
Well, I pray that you're jokin'.

01:19:46.328 --> 01:19:49.373
Bring me the trackers.

01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:56.588
He's hurt.

01:19:56.672 --> 01:19:59.007
It's not what you think.
They weren't after her.

01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:01.718
- I saw what I saw.
- What?

01:20:06.098 --> 01:20:08.016
No more lies.

01:20:09.518 --> 01:20:12.729
What are the marks on her back?

01:20:12.813 --> 01:20:15.482
People say it's the way to Dryland.

01:20:15.524 --> 01:20:18.151
Dryland's a myth!

01:20:18.193 --> 01:20:21.238
No! You said so yourself
that you know where it is.

01:20:21.321 --> 01:20:23.240
You did.

01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:30.664
You're a fool to believe in something
you've never seen before.

01:20:30.706 --> 01:20:35.169
I've seen it. I've touched it!
Dirt that was richer
and darker than yours.

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.129
It was in the basket
we found Enola in!

01:20:37.212 --> 01:20:39.840
- It doesn't exist!
- Well, how can you be so sure?

01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:44.636
Because I've sailed farther than most
have dreamed, and I've never seen it.

01:20:46.555 --> 01:20:49.391
But the things on your boat!

01:20:49.433 --> 01:20:51.852
"Things on my boat" what?

01:20:51.894 --> 01:20:55.355
There are things on your boat
that nobody has ever seen!

01:20:55.397 --> 01:20:57.566
What are these shells?

01:20:57.649 --> 01:21:00.777
And that reflecting glass?

01:21:00.861 --> 01:21:05.240
And th-the music box?
That...

01:21:05.282 --> 01:21:08.994
Well, if not from Dryland,
then where? Wh-Where?

01:21:11.872 --> 01:21:13.832
You wanna see Dryland?

01:21:15.542 --> 01:21:17.461
You really wanna see it?

01:21:19.129 --> 01:21:21.215
I'll take you to Dryland.

01:21:28.555 --> 01:21:30.474
Get in.

01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:39.608
- Well, what about Enola?
- There's only air for one.

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:41.985
- Get in the water.
- It'll be all right.

01:21:47.616 --> 01:21:49.701
Don't touch anything.

01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:56.416
Okay?

01:25:27.503 --> 01:25:29.463
I didn't know.

01:25:31.298 --> 01:25:34.301
All this time...

01:25:34.343 --> 01:25:36.303
I didn't know.

01:25:36.345 --> 01:25:38.305
Nobody does.

01:25:46.355 --> 01:25:48.357
Can you get us outta here?

01:25:48.398 --> 01:25:51.902
I'd say there're
two chances o' that.

01:25:51.985 --> 01:25:54.404
- Hey!
- No way and no how.

01:25:54.488 --> 01:25:58.200
Shoulda bought me
that drink. Come on!

01:25:58.283 --> 01:26:00.077
This way. Come on!

01:26:06.834 --> 01:26:09.086
Proper introductions first.

01:26:10.212 --> 01:26:12.673
I'm the Deacon.

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:21.723
If you don't recall the face,
perhaps it's 'cause I didn't
always look like this.

01:26:24.852 --> 01:26:28.480
Now, ahem, I suspect
she's somewhere real close.

01:26:28.564 --> 01:26:34.403
So we can tear this boat apart
lookin' for her, but I'd rather
somebody tell me where she is.

01:26:34.486 --> 01:26:37.322
And the first one
that does that, lives.

01:26:37.406 --> 01:26:41.785
And the runner-up...
Well, actually, there are no runners-up.

01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:47.040
Oh, sweet Joe,
I love this part.

01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:49.960
Choose 'em. One, two.
Live or die.

01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:54.631
You know, personally,

01:26:54.715 --> 01:26:57.634
I'd rather shoot
the sperm-of-the-devil here.

01:26:57.718 --> 01:27:00.929
Huh? But you know somethin'?

01:27:01.013 --> 01:27:03.515
I don't think you're gonna
tell me, are ya?

01:27:03.599 --> 01:27:05.517
Huh? Too bad.

01:27:06.643 --> 01:27:10.147
Come on, eh?
What do you say?

01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:12.149
She's not your kind.

01:27:13.609 --> 01:27:16.111
You don't even have a kind.

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:20.324
If you say it,
he'll still kill us both.

01:27:24.661 --> 01:27:26.622
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

01:27:28.624 --> 01:27:30.584
If you don't tell me,

01:27:30.626 --> 01:27:33.212
I swear to Poseidon
I will torch your boat.

01:27:39.801 --> 01:27:43.305
Refresh my memory.
What happens when neither of 'em talks?

01:27:43.347 --> 01:27:46.183
- Never happened before.
- Never happened before.

01:27:46.266 --> 01:27:48.894
All right!

01:27:48.977 --> 01:27:54.066
If they won't tell us where
she is, do 'em! Both of 'em!
Kill 'em now!

01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:57.027
- No!
- No!

01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:59.029
So gullible!
Bring her here.

01:28:01.615 --> 01:28:04.326
- Take and ye shall receive!
- No! Leave her!

01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:07.079
So ends your daily sermonette!

01:28:07.162 --> 01:28:10.999
All we gotta do is figure out this map.
Turn her upside down.

01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:14.419
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

01:28:14.503 --> 01:28:18.006
We'll figure it out back
at the 'Deez. Back at the 'Deez, boys.

01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:20.425
Careful with her.
Careful with her!

01:28:20.509 --> 01:28:22.386
- What about them?
- Do 'em both.

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:25.055
Torch the boat.

01:28:28.517 --> 01:28:31.436
We have to go under!

01:28:32.563 --> 01:28:35.440
No, I can't breath like you!

01:28:35.524 --> 01:28:37.442
I'll breathe for both of us.

01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:04.011
Whoo!

01:29:04.052 --> 01:29:06.013
Helen!

01:29:08.056 --> 01:29:13.604
Helen, help!
Helen! Helen!

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.720
My boat.

01:29:56.146 --> 01:29:58.106
Enola.

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:03.278
What is this?
Get those chains off her.

01:30:03.362 --> 01:30:06.281
What are we, barbarians here?

01:30:06.365 --> 01:30:08.784
Goodness gracious.
Sakes alive.

01:30:08.825 --> 01:30:11.286
Come on. Outta here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

01:30:12.955 --> 01:30:15.374
Well, rub-a-dub-dub.

01:30:17.292 --> 01:30:20.671
You wanna come over here
and sit on my lap?

01:30:20.754 --> 01:30:23.465
No? Ahem.

01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:26.552
How 'bout a cigarette?

01:30:26.635 --> 01:30:30.055
Nothin' like a good smoke
if you miss your mom.

01:30:30.138 --> 01:30:32.057
Never too young to start.

01:30:33.684 --> 01:30:37.062
No. Well, I got somethin'
right here I know you'd like.

01:30:38.814 --> 01:30:41.358
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:47.573
Huh?
Now they're yours...

01:30:47.656 --> 01:30:51.910
if you help me with just
one problem, all right?

01:30:54.913 --> 01:30:58.500
Now, ahem... Now that tattoo
on your back... Ahem.

01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:04.673
I've been told that, uh...
that's actually a map?

01:31:07.843 --> 01:31:10.220
It's the way to Dryland.

01:31:10.304 --> 01:31:12.222
Now we're gettin' someplace.

01:31:14.016 --> 01:31:16.810
Could you teach me
how to read that?

01:31:19.688 --> 01:31:21.648
Setback.

01:31:23.859 --> 01:31:27.988
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:33.202
You know, like your mommy or
your pet fish? Did he say anything?

01:31:33.243 --> 01:31:35.704
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

01:31:35.746 --> 01:31:41.168
Girl, I don't give a shit
what he'd like. He took out my eye.

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:47.174
And if I ever see him again, I'm gonna
cut open his head and eat his brains!

01:31:47.216 --> 01:31:49.468
You think he'd like that?

01:31:49.551 --> 01:31:53.305
Can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

01:31:54.389 --> 01:31:56.558
But he's not here.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.560
And he ain't comin'.

01:31:58.602 --> 01:32:00.479
And no one's gonna save you.

01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:03.815
He'll come for me. He will.

01:32:03.899 --> 01:32:07.945
Then you better tell me what I wanna
know or he can see what's left of you...

01:32:08.028 --> 01:32:10.197
in a goddamn jar.

01:32:20.499 --> 01:32:22.876
We're going to die here,
aren't we?

01:32:42.771 --> 01:32:44.690
Aren't we?

01:32:54.116 --> 01:32:56.827
After the atoll,

01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:59.580
when I offered myself to you,

01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:04.626
why didn't you take me?

01:33:06.503 --> 01:33:08.463
'Cause you didn't really want me.

01:33:10.424 --> 01:33:13.427
Not really.

01:35:09.168 --> 01:35:11.503
Have I been asleep long?

01:35:17.217 --> 01:35:19.136
I was dreaming.

01:35:21.638 --> 01:35:24.641
It's funny.

01:35:24.725 --> 01:35:27.436
I always thought Dryland floated.

01:35:27.519 --> 01:35:30.939
That it drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:33.275
Why did you believe in it so much?

01:35:34.568 --> 01:35:37.112
Because we weren't made for the sea.

01:35:38.447 --> 01:35:41.700
Got hands... and feet.

01:35:41.783 --> 01:35:44.411
We're supposed to walk.

01:35:47.456 --> 01:35:49.374
I miss her sound.

01:35:51.919 --> 01:35:53.837
Don't you?

01:35:57.341 --> 01:35:59.218
Helen!

01:35:59.301 --> 01:36:02.471
He... No, no, no.
Helen, up here. Above you!

01:36:02.513 --> 01:36:05.098
Gregor!

01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:12.189
Smart thinking
to burn your boat.

01:36:12.272 --> 01:36:16.026
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:18.153
Who's that with you?

01:36:18.195 --> 01:36:21.907
Ichthyus Sapien,
is that really you?

01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:25.953
I'll throw the rope down.
You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

01:36:28.163 --> 01:36:31.667
Helen. Where's Enola?

01:36:31.708 --> 01:36:37.130
Smokers took her. They'd have me too
if it weren't for him.

01:36:37.172 --> 01:36:41.385
My friend, thank you.
Very human of you.

01:36:43.345 --> 01:36:46.014
Go grab your things quickly.
Quickly. Come.

01:36:53.897 --> 01:36:55.941
You see?
Right down there.

01:36:56.024 --> 01:36:59.027
There's several of us survivors.
We'll just start over again.

01:37:01.071 --> 01:37:03.031
You can't ask us
to go get her!

01:37:03.073 --> 01:37:05.325
Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble.

01:37:05.367 --> 01:37:10.163
They don't have any
reason to kill her. They need
to find Dryland just like we do.

01:37:10.205 --> 01:37:14.209
- Of course.
- If the Mariner's
willing to go, why not us?

01:37:14.251 --> 01:37:16.378
If he wants to go, then let him!

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.673
We don't want you here!
You or the girl!

01:37:19.715 --> 01:37:24.178
Helen. The papers
the Mariner brought you...

01:37:24.219 --> 01:37:28.891
It's the same language the tattoo
is written in. They're numbers.

01:37:28.932 --> 01:37:32.227
- Gregor, you're as crazy as she is!
- We can't stay here!

01:37:32.311 --> 01:37:35.898
We're wasting valuable time.
More Smokers will come.
We need to be moving now!

01:37:35.981 --> 01:37:40.360
My friends, don't you see we need
this child if we want to find Dryland?

01:37:40.402 --> 01:37:42.404
- I'm not goin'.
- Nobody is.

01:37:42.446 --> 01:37:44.865
We've seen their smoke
on the horizon!

01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:47.701
- Know what that is yet?
- The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

01:37:47.743 --> 01:37:53.290
It seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location:
Latitude, longitude.

01:37:53.373 --> 01:37:58.212
It doesn't make sense, though.
The numbers, they seem
to be backwards or something.

01:37:58.253 --> 01:38:00.422
- It's upside down.
- The world?

01:38:00.506 --> 01:38:03.133
The poles have reversed themselves?

01:38:03.217 --> 01:38:05.469
I've been mappin' the cities below.

01:38:08.263 --> 01:38:11.683
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

01:38:11.767 --> 01:38:14.978
- That's blasphemy!
- No, it's true.

01:38:15.062 --> 01:38:19.775
I've seen it with
my own eyes. There is land.
It's right under our keel.

01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:21.944
- None of it's dry anymore.
- Some is.

01:38:23.403 --> 01:38:27.991
Enola's been there.
I know that now. I saw what she drew.

01:38:28.075 --> 01:38:31.912
So that's why he's going after Enola...
to find Dryland.

01:38:31.954 --> 01:38:34.665
I don't care about Dryland.

01:38:34.748 --> 01:38:37.584
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

01:38:37.626 --> 01:38:39.920
He doesn't even know
which direction they came from.

01:38:39.962 --> 01:38:44.800
- I say let him go.
- We're better off
without them anyway!

01:38:44.883 --> 01:38:48.637
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

01:38:48.679 --> 01:38:53.308
Forget the mute-o, Helen.
If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:57.020
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.

01:38:57.104 --> 01:39:01.149
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

01:39:07.239 --> 01:39:10.200
You got that tattoo
figured out yet?

01:39:10.242 --> 01:39:12.870
It would be easier if it was flat...
big and flat.

01:39:12.911 --> 01:39:15.789
- It needs to be flat.
- What you got in mind?

01:39:15.873 --> 01:39:20.210
Well, you cut it off her back.
You stretch it, mount it.

01:39:20.252 --> 01:39:23.922
- Give us a proper look.
- Take her down below until I holler.

01:39:24.006 --> 01:39:26.258
Saint Joe, we're close.

01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:30.846
After centuries of shame.

01:41:01.228 --> 01:41:04.898
- They're gettin' ugly.
- Don't I know it.

01:41:04.982 --> 01:41:07.025
Announce me, cousin.

01:41:11.071 --> 01:41:13.198
Hey. Here he is.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.200
Deacon!

01:41:15.242 --> 01:41:17.786
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

01:41:19.454 --> 01:41:22.875
Turn your eyes and open your hearts...

01:41:22.958 --> 01:41:25.377
to your humble benefactor,

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:29.339
your spiritual shepherd
and dictator for life,

01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:32.384
the Deacon of the 'Deez.

01:41:53.947 --> 01:41:57.075
- Look out!
- It's mine! It's mine!

01:42:03.749 --> 01:42:07.085
- Deacon!
- Wahoo!

01:42:07.169 --> 01:42:12.925
Children.
Children of the provider.

01:42:13.008 --> 01:42:16.887
Citizens of the good ship.
Please now, hear me speak.

01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:23.977
- I've had a vision.
- Yeah, we're tired of your visions!

01:42:24.061 --> 01:42:26.438
What about the land
you promised us?

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.274
Yeah! Yeah!

01:42:29.316 --> 01:42:31.527
O ye of little faith.

01:42:31.610 --> 01:42:33.862
I've had a vision so great...

01:42:33.946 --> 01:42:37.324
that as it came to me, I wept.

01:42:37.407 --> 01:42:41.537
- And in this splenditudinous
figment of wonder,
- Is that Bone's ride?

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:43.705
- Is that blood on the seat?
- I saw...

01:42:43.789 --> 01:42:47.626
And you know
what it is that I saw.

01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:51.630
I saw... the land.

01:43:24.705 --> 01:43:26.874
Horse, that you?

01:43:31.545 --> 01:43:34.673
Look, just bring it in slow,
okay? I don't have all day.

01:43:34.756 --> 01:43:38.135
Horse!

01:43:38.177 --> 01:43:40.679
Just bring it up slow.

01:43:41.805 --> 01:43:44.683
I said slow!

01:43:49.479 --> 01:43:53.483
Shouldn't be doing that.
You're gonna get in trouble.

01:43:53.525 --> 01:43:55.819
Ha. That's right.

01:43:55.861 --> 01:43:59.907
You're not afraid. You've got
your pet freak comin' to rescue you.

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:04.536
He's not a freak,
and he can take you anytime.

01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:08.707
He's killed dozens of people, and he
doesn't have any mercy or anything.

01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:10.918
He even kills little girls.

01:44:12.794 --> 01:44:14.379
Haven't we all?

01:44:16.465 --> 01:44:18.467
Shit.

01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:20.719
It's Horse.

01:44:22.054 --> 01:44:24.556
- Find him. Find him!
- Come on!

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.936
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:44:29.019 --> 01:44:32.689
- Come on.
- Gettin' nervous, aren't you?

01:44:36.985 --> 01:44:38.904
I don't get nervous.

01:44:40.239 --> 01:44:42.741
And if there's a river, we'll dam it.

01:44:42.824 --> 01:44:47.287
And if there's a tree,
we'll ram it.

01:44:47.371 --> 01:44:50.499
'Cause I'm talkin' progress here.

01:44:50.582 --> 01:44:53.585
Yes, sir. I'm talkin' development.

01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:57.714
- Yeah!
- For we shall suck and savor...

01:44:57.756 --> 01:45:02.219
the sweet flavor of Dryland.

01:45:02.261 --> 01:45:04.137
Face is all red.

01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:09.309
Helen said with anybody
that has a face that red,

01:45:09.393 --> 01:45:11.562
he's had too much sun
or too much to drink.

01:45:11.603 --> 01:45:15.732
- All right, that's it.
I'm gonna burn your face.
- Almost time.

01:45:15.774 --> 01:45:19.903
- What's up?
- We're just talkin' about our friend.

01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:25.117
- What's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

01:45:25.158 --> 01:45:27.786
So death can't find him.

01:45:27.828 --> 01:45:29.788
Nah-nah.

01:45:33.041 --> 01:45:36.962
Doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

01:45:37.045 --> 01:45:39.965
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

01:45:40.048 --> 01:45:43.677
He's fast and strong
like a big wind.

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:46.972
He can hear a hundred miles
and see a hundred miles underwater.

01:45:47.055 --> 01:45:51.101
He can hide in the shadow
of the noon sun.

01:45:51.143 --> 01:45:55.063
He could be right behind you, and you
won't even know it 'til you're dead!

01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:59.651
Give it a rest.

01:46:00.944 --> 01:46:02.988
He'll come for me. He will.

01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:05.657
- We are the people...
- Yeah?

01:46:05.699 --> 01:46:09.161
- Well, I hope he does.
- The Lord's creation.

01:46:10.454 --> 01:46:12.372
Remember you said that.

01:46:13.498 --> 01:46:16.293
Look at us.

01:46:16.335 --> 01:46:19.004
- Look at us here today.
- Yeah!

01:46:19.046 --> 01:46:22.674
Dryland is not just
our destination,

01:46:22.758 --> 01:46:24.843
but it is our destiny!

01:46:34.228 --> 01:46:36.688
Find him. Find him!

01:46:36.772 --> 01:46:38.941
How can I find...

01:46:39.024 --> 01:46:41.151
this glorious place?

01:46:42.194 --> 01:46:45.030
And he said to me:

01:46:45.072 --> 01:46:49.034
"A child shall lead you."

01:46:50.536 --> 01:46:52.663
A child.

01:46:52.704 --> 01:46:55.040
- And behold!
- It's time.

01:46:55.082 --> 01:46:58.168
The instrument of our salvation!

01:47:05.676 --> 01:47:08.095
Our guide in the wild.

01:47:08.178 --> 01:47:10.556
Our beacon in the darkness.

01:47:10.639 --> 01:47:12.558
Turn her around, Nord.

01:47:12.641 --> 01:47:15.435
She has shown me the path!

01:47:19.898 --> 01:47:23.402
And before the holy-most moment
is upon us,

01:47:23.443 --> 01:47:26.905
let's sacrifice one
to old Saint Joe.

01:47:30.075 --> 01:47:33.704
And let's get this
tub of shit up to speed.

01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:41.753
Yep.

01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:21.668
Pull!

01:48:21.752 --> 01:48:24.421
- Pull!
- Pull!

01:48:24.463 --> 01:48:26.632
- Pull.
- Pull!

01:48:41.146 --> 01:48:43.065
Ow.

01:48:46.610 --> 01:48:49.905
- So which way we rowin'?
- I don't have a goddamn clue.

01:48:49.988 --> 01:48:51.907
Don't worry.

01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:54.952
They'll row for a month
before they figure out I'm fakin' it.

01:48:54.993 --> 01:48:57.663
But, um, wh-wh...

01:48:57.746 --> 01:49:00.874
Oh, you want details.
Well, I'm not tellin' these savages...

01:49:00.958 --> 01:49:03.168
that we haven't
solved the map yet.

01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:08.632
I promised them results,
and I'll get 'em if I gotta
cut 'em out of her goddamn back.

01:49:10.092 --> 01:49:13.470
Who is that?
Who is that?

01:49:14.555 --> 01:49:17.015
Maybe one of
the spare rowers?

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.693
Why aren't you rowin'?

01:49:36.243 --> 01:49:38.370
- It's him.
- It is him.

01:49:39.746 --> 01:49:42.416
You guys are in
so much trouble.

01:49:45.252 --> 01:49:49.631
Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.

01:49:49.715 --> 01:49:53.510
You know, he's like
a turd that won't flush.

01:49:53.552 --> 01:49:56.221
I want the girl.

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:03.812
You know, I thought you
were stupid, friend.

01:50:03.896 --> 01:50:06.815
But I underestimated you.

01:50:06.899 --> 01:50:09.902
You're a total freakin' retard.

01:50:13.113 --> 01:50:16.366
I want the girl. That's all.

01:50:16.408 --> 01:50:21.246
Well, what on this screwed-up Earth
makes you think you're gonna get her?

01:50:29.505 --> 01:50:31.423
You know what this is?

01:50:35.761 --> 01:50:38.263
I drop it, you burn.

01:50:38.347 --> 01:50:42.267
- We all burn.
- Now wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:50:42.309 --> 01:50:46.146
Ahem. Let's not do
anything rash here.

01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:49.441
I mean, uh, are you sure
she's worth all this?

01:50:49.483 --> 01:50:52.653
She never does stop talkin'.
She never shuts up.

01:50:52.736 --> 01:50:55.072
- I noticed.
- What is it then?

01:50:55.113 --> 01:50:57.449
Huh? It's the map.

01:50:58.951 --> 01:51:01.745
She's my friend.

01:51:01.787 --> 01:51:04.581
Golly gee.
A single tear rolls down my cheek.

01:51:04.623 --> 01:51:07.584
I mean, you're gonna
die for your friend.

01:51:08.961 --> 01:51:10.921
If it comes to that.

01:51:13.215 --> 01:51:17.636
- He's bluffing. I'll kill him.
- He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.

01:51:17.719 --> 01:51:18.929
Shut up!

01:51:20.264 --> 01:51:25.435
I don't... l-l... I don't think
you're gonna drop that torch, my friend.

01:51:25.477 --> 01:51:29.147
- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

01:51:32.693 --> 01:51:35.487
No!

01:51:42.452 --> 01:51:45.163
Oh, thank God.

01:52:02.097 --> 01:52:04.391
Look out!

01:52:04.474 --> 01:52:06.977
Get him!

01:52:07.019 --> 01:52:10.522
Let's go, goddamn it!

01:52:10.606 --> 01:52:15.360
Don't just stand there! Kill somethin'!

01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:20.449
Was this your big vision?

01:52:29.166 --> 01:52:33.086
Oh, yeah! I've always wanted
to drive this monster.

01:52:36.381 --> 01:52:39.551
There he is!
There he is!

01:52:42.638 --> 01:52:45.015
That's him! There!

01:52:57.903 --> 01:53:01.532
No! Let go!

01:53:11.208 --> 01:53:13.585
Let go!

01:53:17.005 --> 01:53:19.591
- Let me go! Let go!
- Pilot!

01:53:19.633 --> 01:53:22.094
- Pilot!
- Let me go!

01:53:22.177 --> 01:53:24.096
Let go!

01:53:24.179 --> 01:53:26.139
Let go-o-o-o!

01:53:28.433 --> 01:53:31.353
You should've stayed underwater.

01:53:36.775 --> 01:53:39.486
Oh!

01:53:41.113 --> 01:53:45.450
Now you know how to fly an airplane?
You're lucky I do.

01:53:45.534 --> 01:53:48.537
Ow! Now you stop it!
You behave yourself now!

01:54:43.592 --> 01:54:46.637
Oh!

01:55:21.004 --> 01:55:22.923
It's going down.

01:55:23.006 --> 01:55:28.220
- You can see it sinking.
- Gregor, bring us
right down on top of it.

01:55:28.262 --> 01:55:30.430
- Hurry, Gregor!
- Don't worry.

01:55:30.514 --> 01:55:32.432
Hurry.

01:55:44.194 --> 01:55:47.364
Enola! Up here!

01:55:47.406 --> 01:55:49.408
Grab on!

01:55:54.496 --> 01:55:56.456
Are they on yet?

01:55:59.835 --> 01:56:02.629
- What is it?
- I don't know!

01:56:02.713 --> 01:56:04.506
No!

01:56:13.765 --> 01:56:19.188
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip
your cute little lungs out.

01:56:33.452 --> 01:56:35.996
Pull! Almost.

01:57:15.077 --> 01:57:16.828
No!

01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:19.831
No! Enola!

01:57:21.166 --> 01:57:23.627
Saint Joe.
Hole in one.

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:27.506
- Helen!
- No! Enola!
- Helen!

01:57:27.548 --> 01:57:30.217
Hey! Hey!

01:57:36.807 --> 01:57:40.853
Ohh. Oh, no! Quick!
What are we gonna do?

01:57:40.894 --> 01:57:44.064
Hyah! Hyah!

01:57:44.147 --> 01:57:46.692
Tie this off.

01:57:50.112 --> 01:57:52.906
- Hurry!
- Tie it!

01:57:57.494 --> 01:58:00.038
- Got it!
- Ah!

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:15.429
Get 'em up now.

01:58:25.522 --> 01:58:28.942
- Of course! North is south.
- What?

01:58:29.026 --> 01:58:32.404
- South is north.
- I was swimming.

01:58:32.446 --> 01:58:34.698
- I saw.
- My friends.

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:36.867
My friends, look.

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:41.747
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,

01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:47.002
then Dryland is that way!

02:00:48.373 --> 02:00:51.418
It's fresh!

02:00:51.502 --> 02:00:54.171
All of this!
It's fresh!

02:01:01.386 --> 02:01:03.305
No!

02:01:07.851 --> 02:01:10.229
Whoo! Whoo!

02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:12.606
I found something!

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:28.872
Maybe we should put them
under the dirt.

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.874
I think it was their way.

02:01:33.126 --> 02:01:35.087
They must have known
they were dying.

02:02:05.742 --> 02:02:07.661
I'm home.

02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:21.133
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

02:02:26.471 --> 02:02:29.141
Wait. Wait!
I want to show you this.

02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:44.299
First time in your life
you got nothin' to say?

02:03:59.106 --> 02:04:01.733
Enola, I have to go now.

02:04:01.775 --> 02:04:03.735
But you came back for me.

02:04:05.821 --> 02:04:07.739
I like you.

02:04:12.911 --> 02:04:14.872
Why are you leaving?

02:04:17.666 --> 02:04:21.336
- I don't belong here.
I belong out there.
- You belong here.

02:04:24.673 --> 02:04:27.551
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:30.429
Helen said that
it's only land sickness.

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.225
We're all feeling it.
It'll go away soon.

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:37.227
It's more than that.

You know, I thought you
were stupid, friend.

01:50:03.896 --> 01:50:06.815

- But I underestimated you.

01:50:06.899 --> 01:50:09.902
You're a total freakin' retard.

- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

01:51:32.693 --> 01:51:35.487
No!

01:51:42.452 --> 01:51:45.163
Oh, thank God.

01:51:48.959 --> 01:51:51.670
[Screaming]

01:51:56.925 --> 01:52:00.053

[Smoker]
Look out! [Screaming]

01:52:04.474 --> 01:52:06.977
Get him!

01:52:07.019 --> 01:52:10.522
Let's go, goddamn it!

- [Screaming]
- Don't just stand there!
Kill somethin'!

01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:20.449

01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:27.331
[Screaming]

01:52:29.166 --> 01:52:33.086
Oh, yeah! I've always wanted
to drive this monster.

01:52:36.381 --> 01:52:39.551
There he is!
There he is!

01:52:42.638 --> 01:52:45.015
That's him! There!

01:52:47.226 --> 01:52:49.728

01:52:52.105 --> 01:52:55.108

No! Let go!

01:53:07.329 --> 01:53:09.248
[Explosion]

01:53:11.208 --> 01:53:13.585
[Enola]
Let go!

01:53:17.005 --> 01:53:19.591

- [Deacon] Pilot!

01:53:19.633 --> 01:53:22.094

- [Mariner Cocking Gun]
- Let go!

01:53:24.179 --> 01:53:26.139
Let go-o-o-o!

01:53:28.433 --> 01:53:31.353
[Laughing]
You should've stayed underwater.

01:53:31.436 --> 01:53:34.314
[Clicks Twice]

01:53:36.775 --> 01:53:39.486
Oh!

01:53:41.113 --> 01:53:45.450
Now you know how to fly an airplane?
You're lucky I do.

01:53:45.534 --> 01:53:48.537
Ow! Now you stop it!
You behave yourself now!

01:54:19.568 --> 01:54:21.820

01:55:21.004 --> 01:55:22.923
[Helen]
It's going down.

01:55:23.006 --> 01:55:28.220
- You can see it sinking.
- Gregor, bring us
right down on top of it.

01:55:28.262 --> 01:55:30.430
- Hurry, Gregor!
- [Gregor] Don't worry.

01:55:30.514 --> 01:55:32.432

Grab on!

[Gregor]
Are they on yet?

01:55:59.835 --> 01:56:02.629
- [Gregor] What is it?
- [Helen] I don't know!

01:56:02.713 --> 01:56:04.506
No!

01:56:13.765 --> 01:56:19.188
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip
your cute little lungs out.

01:56:22.858 --> 01:56:24.818
[Yelling]

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:30.908
[Enraged Shout]

01:56:33.452 --> 01:56:35.996
Pull! Almost.

01:56:39.833 --> 01:56:42.461

Ohh. Oh, no! Quick!
What are we gonna do?

01:57:40.894 --> 01:57:44.064
Hyah! Hyah!

01:57:44.147 --> 01:57:46.692
Tie this off.

01:57:57.494 --> 01:58:00.038

- [Enola Grunting]
- [Gregor Laughing]

01:58:25.522 --> 01:58:28.942
- [Gregor] Of course!
North is south.
- What?

01:58:29.026 --> 01:58:32.404
- South is north.
- I was swimming.

01:58:32.446 --> 01:58:34.698
- I saw.
- [Gregor] My friends.

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:36.867
My friends, look.

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:41.747
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,

01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:47.002
then Dryland is that way!

01:59:54.862 --> 01:59:57.698

Whoo! Whoo!

02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:12.606
I found something!

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:28.872
Maybe we should put them
under the dirt.

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.874
I think it was their way.

02:01:33.126 --> 02:01:35.087
[Gregor] They must have known
they were dying.

02:01:35.170 --> 02:01:37.089

02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:21.133
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

02:02:26.471 --> 02:02:29.141
Wait. Wait!
I want to show you this.

[Birds Twittering, Chirping]

02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:44.299
First time in your life
you got nothin' to say?

02:03:59.106 --> 02:04:01.733
Enola, I have to go now.

02:04:01.775 --> 02:04:03.735
But you came back for me.

02:04:05.821 --> 02:04:07.739
I like you.

02:04:12.911 --> 02:04:14.872
Why are you leaving?

02:04:17.666 --> 02:04:21.336
- I don't belong here.
I belong out there.
- You belong here.

02:04:24.673 --> 02:04:27.551
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:30.429
Helen said that
it's only land sickness.

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.225
We're all feeling it.
It'll go away soon.

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:37.227
It's more than that.
