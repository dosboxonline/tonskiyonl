00:14.360 --> 00:17.080

00:17.160 --> 00:20.440

It's a trap. We're under attack.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.680
They must've cured themselves.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
He's one of them.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.880
I'm looking for someone.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.120
Professor Bill Ward.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.640
KARIEM: You've been gone for months.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.400
What did they do to you?

00:57.040 --> 00:58.120
You have to kill him.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.120
Mmm...

02:26.200 --> 02:29.520
ADINA: He's creating a virus
that will slaughter our people.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.640
You will die with us.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.240
You can stop it from happening.

02:34.880 --> 02:35.960
How?

02:36.520 --> 02:37.720
You have to kill him.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.160
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

02:48.120 --> 02:49.200
Em, what's wrong?

02:51.320 --> 02:52.560
I can feel them.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.120
What do you mean?

02:57.080 --> 02:58.400
I can feel them.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.920
I feel their pain.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.760
It's okay.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.600
You're safe now.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.320
None of us are safe.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.160
MOKRANI: (IN FRENCH) How long have you
been sitting with him?

04:00.760 --> 04:02.360
Most of the night.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.520
Has he said anything?

04:10.840 --> 04:12.680
I gave him the antibiotics.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.560
The equations in his notepad.
I think they're important.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.880
More important than

04:18.000 --> 04:19.680
the lives of the people here?

04:23.240 --> 04:24.240
Hmm?

04:40.040 --> 04:41.040

04:44.840 --> 04:47.120
(IN ENGLISH) This will terminate
the pregnancy in the first ten weeks.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.520
Okay.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.040
Have you told Nathan?

04:51.120 --> 04:53.160
No. It's better if he never knows.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.360
If there's anything else you need.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.160
Thank you.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.880
They'll never know they were human.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.040
It's better this way.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.920
If they knew,

05:28.240 --> 05:29.480
they'd grow up to hate us.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.320
Like we grew up to hate them?

05:37.440 --> 05:38.800
We lost some more of our people.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.280
-How many?
-Six.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.680
We cure ourselves
so we can die fighting them?

05:45.080 --> 05:46.240
We have no choice.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.240
We kill them, they kill us.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.400
Sometimes I think it will never end.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.080
It's different this time.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.040
Emily knows what she's got to do.

Thank you.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.840
The equations...

07:50.520 --> 07:51.600
What are they?

07:52.560 --> 07:53.800
They're formulas.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.840
To measure the collapse
of the matter waves.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.320
This matter wave...

08:01.440 --> 08:03.800
Is it what we call
wave particle duality?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.160
It's all around us.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.960
It's...

08:12.480 --> 08:14.200
It's only when we see them,

08:15.600 --> 08:18.360
that we call them objects or things.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.520
Only then
are they part of space and time.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.840
We know of these collapses.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.960
We only partially understand them.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.840
It took us hundreds of years.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.040
Even now,

08:39.360 --> 08:41.920
transposing the matter waves
is dangerous.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.120
(EXHALES)

08:45.280 --> 08:46.640
You can control them?

08:47.960 --> 08:50.760
Can you move objects
through space and time?

08:52.880 --> 08:53.880
Yes.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.680
We detected ripples
in interstellar space,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.200
close to the edge of our solar system.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.880
Do you know what they were?

09:07.640 --> 09:08.840
They are the echoes

09:09.960 --> 09:11.680
of our transposition,

09:13.040 --> 09:14.280
our journey to Earth.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.680
But you came to Earth
more than six months ago.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.920
Why are we only detecting
these ripples now?

09:23.160 --> 09:25.680
The echoes travel

09:25.760 --> 09:27.480
at the speed of light.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.760
It took them longer to get here.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.200
Longer than you?

09:39.560 --> 09:41.640
Our journey took no time at all.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.800
Hey.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.880
You said you wanted to change things?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.600
It's not too late.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.760
What do you mean?

10:10.800 --> 10:13.320
How? How can you change it?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.920
Leave us.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.960
Did he say anything?

10:36.840 --> 10:39.600
He said their journey to Earth
took no time at all.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.680
How is that possible?

10:41.760 --> 10:44.880
In the quantum world, photons
and electrons can affect each other

10:44.960 --> 10:47.240
even if they're hundreds of miles apart.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.880
It happens in an instant.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.480
There's no travel, no communication,
no time passes.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.360
Can they use this?

10:55.480 --> 10:58.640
I think they can move objects
instantaneously across vast distances.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.880
I think it's how they got here.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.800

I don't know.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.760
I don't know.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.920
He said we could change things.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.720
That it wasn't too late.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.840
If you can manipulate the world
on a quantum level,

11:21.920 --> 11:22.960
then maybe anything is possible.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.560
Yeah, maybe.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.280
All I could think about
was getting answers.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.960
That was more important
to me than anything.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.400
How can you love someone
who thinks like that?

11:59.640 --> 12:01.840
