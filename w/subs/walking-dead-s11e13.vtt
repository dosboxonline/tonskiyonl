WEBVTT

00:30.280 --> 00:32.449
- What are we at?
- Eight to nine.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.620
- So still winning.
- For about ten more seconds.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.668
You too?

00:44.753 --> 00:47.130
Yeah. I just talked to Maggie.

00:47.714 --> 00:48.757
What did she say?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.718
Not much. Just gave me this.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.971
Directions to the nearest
Commonwealth checkpoint.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.390
Troopers left them
in case people change their minds.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.310
- Yeah, a lot of people are.
- Yeah.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.523
You'll be back, though, right?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.484
Yeah, I think so.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.700
Okay.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.250
Hey, this is your shot.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.670
You need an escort?

01:31.341 --> 01:32.342
Why?

01:33.843 --> 01:37.347
It's a long walk, you know?
You might get bored, that's all.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.851
Um...

01:47.398 --> 01:50.693
- We've got a rider coming.
- Who is it?

01:55.657 --> 01:56.699
Nobody we know.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.828
Hold where you are!

02:01.329 --> 02:03.456
Hold or we will shoot!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.692
He's been shot! Get help!

02:32.318 --> 02:35.864
The devils, they're slaughtering them.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.326
Liars.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.335
You gotta go.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.673
Yes.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.135
Hey.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.075
We're not going.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.036
Maggie, he died begging for our help.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.204
I understand it.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.831
We're barely holding on as it is.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.167
Someone we know must have sent him.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.877
Could be from the Commonwealth or Georgie.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
Or it could be a trap.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.048
We go to help and leave the Hilltop
open to attack.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.383
I don't think it's a trick.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.760
He was scared. He wasn't lying.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.763
Even if he wasn't,
we can't go up against another group

04:23.763 --> 04:25.098
without the people to fight them.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.808
We don't have that.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.310
What happened to taking in
whoever was in need?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.354
Being outnumbered
has never stopped you before.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.563
Maybe it should have.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.319
We're barely holding on.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.907
It sounds like these people are, too.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.161
That's exactly who my mother
would have targeted, and I helped.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.330
I'm not letting it happen to someone else.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.084
So you're not leaving?

04:54.252 --> 04:57.547
I am. I'm just...
I have to help these people first.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.457
You can take over at the halfway mark.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.838
Mom, Mom.

05:41.632 --> 05:42.717
How long this time?

05:44.886 --> 05:47.722
- What do I always tell you?
- As long as it takes.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.683
That's right. And you're gonna
hold down the fort while I'm gone.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.781
Keep a perimeter. Stay on alert.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.658
- You got it. Good luck.
- Thank you.

06:10.870 --> 06:11.996
Take that for me.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.547
Why don't you want their help?

06:23.716 --> 06:24.759
The Commonwealth's.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.639
Because we can get by without it.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.558
Why do we have to just get by?

06:33.851 --> 06:38.106
It's only temporary.
Easier isn't always better.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.996
You know, before the fall, I lived
on a farm with my family and my dad.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.541
One day, these corporate farm developers

06:56.541 --> 06:58.793
started knocking on our door,
trying to buy us out.

07:00.169 --> 07:04.257
And my dad kept saying no.
And one day this bad drought hit

07:04.924 --> 07:07.135
and the developers started knocking again,

07:07.969 --> 07:10.346
except this time they offered
three times what the farm was worth.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.723
They knew we were in debt and desperate.

07:13.015 --> 07:16.185
They also knew the drought would end,

07:17.061 --> 07:18.813
the farm would become profitable again,

07:18.813 --> 07:20.398
and all they had to do was outlast us.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.819
They started dropping off crates
of food to help with the livestock.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.697
And he would just let it sit there
on the porch and rot

07:27.697 --> 07:29.615
so they'd see it
when the next shipment came.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.909
He said that we were being tested.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.829
And guess what happened.
The drought ended.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.916
We got back on our feet.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.211
And those developers
never bothered us again.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.090
Why did your dad let the food rot?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.508
If they'd seen us take it,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.427
they would have known we needed them.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.053
Never left us alone.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.765
- But the cattle were hungry.
- We didn't lose any.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.643
We stuck together and we made it through.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.521
Yeah, you got by.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.401
It's just...

08:06.777 --> 08:09.530
Getting by is what I've been forced
to do my whole life.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.493
And I was told that it makes
you stronger and wiser,

08:13.826 --> 08:14.952
but it doesn't.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.663
It hurts.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.790
What would you have done?

08:22.710 --> 08:24.420
Asked everyone what they wanted.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.423
Instead of deciding for them.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.258
Is that what I'm doing?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.636
You think the Commonwealth knows better?

08:31.761 --> 08:33.971
- Is that crazy to think?
- Yes.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.600
Those people have not
been tested for ten years.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.144
Do you want to be there when they are?

08:46.776 --> 08:51.030
I just want things
to be the same every day.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.876
Do you agree?

09:08.297 --> 09:10.216
With most of it, yeah.

09:11.842 --> 09:12.885
Whoa! Look out!

09:38.578 --> 09:40.746
Knife slashed
right through the neck guard.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.211
Shot between the armor gaps.

09:48.462 --> 09:49.547
Hey!

09:54.176 --> 09:55.219
Hey!

10:01.475 --> 10:02.518
It's Aaron.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.451
But not only is it born of hate,

10:18.451 --> 10:22.622
but from love and from friendship
and from fear.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.249
And in Luke, 15:12,

10:25.333 --> 10:27.668
Christ speaks
of a rich father's wayward son

10:27.752 --> 10:29.879
that selfishly set off to distant lands

10:30.671 --> 10:35.718
who squandered his riches
on decadence and wild living.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.890
And then the son found his soul empty.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.060
And he was in need.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.522
And he went back to his father
and begged for forgiveness,

10:48.606 --> 10:50.316
and his father embraced him,

10:50.858 --> 10:54.028
for his son was dead and is now alive.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.156
He was lost and now is found.

10:57.948 --> 11:02.370
Now, there were a lot of stunned faces

11:02.370 --> 11:05.081
when I asked all of you
to sit by a stranger today,

11:05.081 --> 11:07.500
and I'm still seeing a lot of
awkwardness with the arrangement.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.962
A lot of stiff backs,
clenched butt cheeks.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.676
Why?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.137
Those of you that were out there
in the wasteland,

11:20.680 --> 11:24.266
you know from the people you found
from the ones you could rely upon

11:24.350 --> 11:27.645
that it didn't matter that you were
strangers beforehand, did it?

11:28.437 --> 11:30.940
You were forced to see the humanity
in each other,

11:31.399 --> 11:32.983
and though not bound by blood,

11:33.067 --> 11:35.653
these strangers became more than friends.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.030
They became family.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.534
Why is it that way out there,

11:43.536 --> 11:44.870
but not that way in here?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.457
Romans, 3:23.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.044
"For all have sinned and fall short
of the glory of God."

11:52.503 --> 11:55.673
Now, let me repeat that.
All of us have sinned.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.135
And that is the very thread
that binds us together.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.680
And if you strip yourselves
of the superficial labels...

12:02.680 --> 12:05.599
"What do we do? Where do I live?

12:05.683 --> 12:07.643
"How much money do I have?"

12:09.353 --> 12:11.522
If you strip yourselves of that,
it will make you see

12:11.522 --> 12:14.567
the person by your side
as you see yourself in the mirror.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.195
The way we were before the world fell

12:18.738 --> 12:21.490
cannot be the way we are moving forward.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.912
We must always remember the thread,
for that is what makes us try.

12:27.413 --> 12:31.876
It makes us forgive.
It makes us return from peril.

12:31.876 --> 12:36.005
It makes us us.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.594
It sounds like
you're blowing smoke up my ass.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.970
No, you were great.

12:42.970 --> 12:47.683
Though I was expecting a little
more fire and brimstone, I guess.

12:49.852 --> 12:50.895
You look happy.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.147
I think I might be.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.066
So that there, that was...

12:56.150 --> 12:57.943
No, it's uh, it's not an act.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.947
In the beginning, I was just
going through the motions,

13:02.239 --> 13:04.116
but then one day I just wasn't.

13:04.742 --> 13:09.497
It was like a switch was flipped
and I could hear him again.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.291
Yeah.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.962
That hell we went through,
it almost feels like it wasn't real.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.258
Like it was just
in a nightmare or something.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.722
What about Alexandria?

13:27.515 --> 13:30.643
Oh. Commonwealth is pouring
even more manpower

13:30.643 --> 13:32.394
and resources into the rebuild.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.731
But, uh, while that's getting finished up,

13:36.607 --> 13:39.026
they've asked me to help out

13:39.026 --> 13:41.028
with their new immigration initiative.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.075
They didn't seem too keen
on immigrants when we came in.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.243
They weren't.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.330
After they heard that I worked
for an NGO back in the day,

13:51.330 --> 13:54.208
they asked me to review
their intake policies.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.501
Now we are reaching out

13:55.501 --> 13:57.211
and bringing in people that need help.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.379
The Lord's work.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.505
Yeah.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.719
Actually, that's, uh, that's why I'm here.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.598
There's a group of about 40 people

14:09.682 --> 14:12.852
holed up in an apartment complex
in the western border in Virginia.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.521
We want to make first contact
and offer them help.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.274
Some of the folks upstairs,

14:19.650 --> 14:21.735
they thought it would be a good idea
if you tagged along.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.362
Why me?

14:24.363 --> 14:28.450
It's a religious group, so...

14:29.618 --> 14:31.245
Any hostiles in the territory?

14:31.245 --> 14:33.122
We'll have troops with us, just in case.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.748
Also, my boss Carlson will be with us.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.459
He's a little, uh... Well, you'll see.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.503
But his heart's in the right place.

14:39.628 --> 14:43.716
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
Carlson's ready when you are.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.426
Oh. Thank you, Jesse.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.056
New kid. We're training him.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.060
What do you say?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.230
What do you know about these people?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.024
According to the scouts,

15:00.024 --> 15:02.192
they're just a friendly group of settlers.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.244
God, you feel that?

15:13.495 --> 15:14.872
That rush.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.125
That mix of dopamine
and adrenaline just...

15:24.256 --> 15:28.802
It's just that anticipation
that we're going to change lives.

15:30.471 --> 15:35.225
You and you, and even you, too, Jesse.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.562
Today we're gonna make the world
just a little bit better

15:38.646 --> 15:39.855
than it was yesterday.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.441
I thought you said
these were friendly settlers.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.985
It doesn't look friendly.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.613
You don't think so?

15:48.155 --> 15:49.198
No.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.868
Okay. What if they aren't, hmm?

15:54.036 --> 15:56.789
If they're angry,
that just means they're afraid.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.750
But when they meet you, they won't be.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.630
Man, I cannot wait
to watch you two do your thing.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.304
Is he going in with us?

16:13.055 --> 16:14.723
He usually does, yeah.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.934
But he's not gonna do any of the talking,

16:16.934 --> 16:18.310
and we'll have backup nearby.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.478
Are you sure?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.900
Hey, are they setting up camp?

16:25.484 --> 16:28.028
- That they are.
- So they're not coming with us?

16:28.737 --> 16:29.863
Mmm.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.658
Better not spook the natives.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.870
Don't worry. They're just a chirp away.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.251
Sergeant Crowe, do you copy? Over.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.880
Copy, sir. Over.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.217
You see? It's all good.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.804
Yeah. I'm not doing this.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.433
Places like that usually have
some old man with a shotgun inside

16:57.558 --> 16:59.935
just looking for an excuse
to kill some dumb ass

17:00.019 --> 17:01.562
who stepped on his front lawn.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.773
Practically screams "do not disturb."

17:04.857 --> 17:06.859
Yeah, I agree.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.944
Hey, is everything all right?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.405
I'm not so sure about this.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.949
Might be better to leave them alone.

17:14.408 --> 17:18.412
Abort? Just because
of some pre-game jitters?

17:18.871 --> 17:22.624
No, because your plan is shit
and I don't want to die. That's all.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.587
I've done it before, we'll do it again.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.007
What's the largest group you've found?

17:32.634 --> 17:34.553
- Four.
- And there are 40 in there.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.722
So?

17:37.306 --> 17:41.477
So, with that many people,
all it takes is one nervous guy

17:41.477 --> 17:44.271
with an itchy trigger finger
to set things off.

17:44.271 --> 17:47.566
- I don't think you appreciate...
- No, no. Hold on. He's right.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.110
- We've never dealt with a...
- Guys.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.821
It's not up for discussion.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.325
I need you to trust that
I know what I'm doing.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.327
So let's go.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.164
Fine.

18:04.666 --> 18:10.422
Hey, I need you to wear that.
It's part of your, uh, costume.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.762
This is how this is going to go.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.237
Hello. My name is Aaron.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.741
We come from a community
called the Commonwealth.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.077
We'd like to extend our friendship.

18:47.209 --> 18:52.714
Our people left these
where you would find them.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.927
Since they're all gone,
I'm assuming you did.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.599
The chicken's a little rubbery,
but does the job.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.769
We have more back at our camp,
if you'd like.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.481
Is there anyone I could speak with
face to face?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.386
Weapons.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.211
Oh. Uh...

20:13.253 --> 20:14.922
It's kind of a bitch to take off.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.261
Just the four of you?

20:22.763 --> 20:25.807
There's a group of peacekeepers nearby

20:26.183 --> 20:27.643
waiting for us to check in.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.144
Sounds scary.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.188
Can't be too safe now, can we?

21:19.152 --> 21:20.529
Last door to the right.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.614
What's down there?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.396
Seats.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.712
I'm Aaron. And like I said outside,

23:00.796 --> 23:04.299
we come from a community
called the Commonwealth, and it's...

23:06.343 --> 23:08.220
Well, it's a bit like the old world.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.889
Fifty thousand people live there.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.766
We have a functioning government,

23:12.766 --> 23:15.685
protective walls, housing for everyone,

23:15.769 --> 23:17.729
restaurants, two movie theaters...

23:17.813 --> 23:23.610
Soldiers and churches, too,
I take it, eh, Father?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.278
Did you lose your collar?

23:26.238 --> 23:30.158
Wanted you to see who I was
before learning what I was.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.619
Hmm.

23:37.666 --> 23:38.750
Okay.

23:40.127 --> 23:45.549
Let's say this place is like the old world

23:45.715 --> 23:47.843
and they do have a church,

23:48.593 --> 23:51.471
then they have to have hookers, too.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.890
Right? And gambling.

23:54.724 --> 23:58.645
Shit side of town where addicts
swap needles with runaways.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.315
You got all that, too?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.778
I haven't seen any of that.

24:09.364 --> 24:12.951
Can I get my bag back?
I'd like to show you something.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.803
Now...

24:41.396 --> 24:42.439
That's where we live.

24:43.190 --> 24:47.068
Whenever people see those photos,
they want to live there, too.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.907
You'd just let us in? That easy?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.117
No, it's not easy at all.

24:54.242 --> 24:57.496
Actually, uh, there's a screening process.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.997
An audition.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.250
Well, let me get my tap dancing shoes.

25:05.712 --> 25:10.717
Where is this, uh, Commonwealth located?

25:11.009 --> 25:13.178
- He can't tell you that.
- Why?

25:14.179 --> 25:15.889
Because you say so?

25:16.890 --> 25:18.016
Yeah, that's right.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.144
Then why am I talking to him?

25:26.733 --> 25:28.193
Do me a favor, fellas.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.239
Turn around, look in that back corner.

25:43.792 --> 25:49.923
Those are raiders, murderers, rapists

25:51.091 --> 25:53.134
and a few cannibals.

25:54.594 --> 26:00.725
All of them sat in the same seats
you're sitting in right now.

26:01.601 --> 26:04.020
Most were wolves dressed as sheep,

26:04.563 --> 26:08.900
all of them meant my people harm, so...

26:13.071 --> 26:17.409
Mr. Head Wolf, if you know where I live,

26:17.409 --> 26:18.910
and I don't know where you live,

26:19.786 --> 26:22.330
how dumb would that be
for me to let you go?

26:25.292 --> 26:26.334
What's your name?

26:29.629 --> 26:30.880
Toby Carlson.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.556
Asses stay in the goddamn chairs!

26:42.392 --> 26:45.186
- Get on your goddamn knees!
- Okay.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.479
Answer the question.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.692
How dumb would I be to let you go

26:50.692 --> 26:52.736
when you know where my home is?

26:53.903 --> 26:55.614
It'd be dumb, okay.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.240
It'd be dumb.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.327
Yes, it would!

27:03.580 --> 27:08.752
You know, you remind me
of old Billy Johnson.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.756
Billy came just a few years ago...

27:14.049 --> 27:19.054
...with promises of great wealth
and prosperity in a land far away.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.849
But Billy wasn't going to bring us
to any promised land.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.144
Billy just wanted
to get us out in the open

27:27.937 --> 27:29.939
so his raiders could thoroughly kill us.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.942
Billy wound up on the shelf

27:34.277 --> 27:37.155
because he thought I was stupid.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.283
Do you think I'm stupid, too?

27:40.367 --> 27:42.410
No, no, no, no, no. I do not...

27:42.494 --> 27:46.373
'Cause I've got plenty of room
on the shelf right next to Billy!

27:46.373 --> 27:47.999
I don't want to be on the shelf,

27:48.083 --> 27:49.834
and I don't think you're stupid, okay?

27:50.919 --> 27:52.754
Show me where your raiding party is,

27:52.754 --> 27:55.840
or I'm going to start
dropping bodies on the floor.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.342
Starting with him.

27:58.802 --> 28:02.681
Hey! Do we look like raiders to you?

28:03.014 --> 28:07.227
Wolves dressed as sheep, speaking lies.

28:09.562 --> 28:14.359
None of you seem to have any idea
what my responsibilities are

28:14.818 --> 28:18.071
to this place and to my people.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.324
Has it occurred to any of you

28:21.449 --> 28:24.703
that they have entrusted me
with their very souls?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.872
Why did you come here? What do you want?

28:27.997 --> 28:31.209
Exactly. What do you have
that we would want?

28:31.584 --> 28:33.795
This place is a shit hole.
Why would we want it?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.673
The meat. You want the meat.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.384
You think we're cannibals?

28:40.260 --> 28:43.638
Cannibals who came in
with prepackaged MREs?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.056
That's what you're going with?

28:45.640 --> 28:49.352
All we've done
is given you food and water.

28:49.436 --> 28:52.105
You aren't starving right now
because of us.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.649
Is that real, or is that a lie?

28:54.733 --> 28:57.777
You know what else is real?
The soldiers in those photos.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.654
If we don't get back, they'll come in here

28:59.738 --> 29:02.615
- and kill all of you.
- Or nobody dies. Okay?

29:03.575 --> 29:07.203
You save yourself and your people
by letting us go.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.330
And we will never come back here again.

29:09.414 --> 29:13.376
And we will never bother you.
I promise that. Okay?

29:18.381 --> 29:19.507
What a day.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.720
What a goddamn day.

29:24.846 --> 29:29.058
You will leave here,
you will never come back...

29:35.815 --> 29:38.318
- What did you do?
- My job.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.154
- He was gonna let us go.
- Shut up!

29:43.281 --> 29:44.616
Keep him hostage.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.786
Lock this door.
I'll be back when it's safe.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.971
Yeah?

30:07.055 --> 30:09.682
Hey, bud. I got your call.

30:10.683 --> 30:11.726
What's up?

30:13.436 --> 30:15.230
Uh, no. Four years sober next month.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.152
What is wrong?

30:22.862 --> 30:25.406
You know how I got Milton to agree
to this whole communal project

30:25.490 --> 30:26.950
with these hick towns down in Virginia?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.117
Yeah.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.745
So she's released
a lot of resources for me,

30:30.912 --> 30:34.165
and I used some of them to send out
a convoy full of supplies

30:34.916 --> 30:35.959
for that other thing.

30:37.043 --> 30:38.419
Convoy didn't check in last week,

30:38.503 --> 30:40.255
so I sent out scouts to see what happened.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.550
It was hijacked.
Troopers guarding it all dead.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.759
Oh, God.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.346
Who was it?

30:49.305 --> 30:52.183
Tracks led to an apartment complex
where some group is holed up.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.645
- Leader dresses like a general.
- Another warlord.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.356
Followers are religious, too.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.360
- Mass on Tuesdays and Sundays.
- Cute.

31:03.486 --> 31:07.240
And they've got your guns now,
and the cargo, too, I take it.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.452
Okay. What am I missing?

31:12.120 --> 31:14.664
It's just some warlord. Snuff him out.

31:14.956 --> 31:15.999
Assume the worst,

31:16.708 --> 31:18.626
that the guns are pointing
out of those top floors

31:18.710 --> 31:20.753
in all directions. I send in a squad,

31:20.837 --> 31:22.130
they get cut down
before they hit the door.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.632
Then don't send a squad, send a company,

31:25.008 --> 31:26.467
then raze the whole building.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.635
I ask for 100 troops,

31:27.719 --> 31:29.596
there's no way Milton doesn't notice.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.181
"What happened, Lance?

31:33.266 --> 31:35.101
"This seems like quite the misfire,
Lance."

31:35.226 --> 31:39.647
No. I need a surgical solution.

31:42.650 --> 31:46.946
Oh, man. I don't do that anymore, Lance.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.072
Come on.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.741
I need the former CIA guy

31:49.741 --> 31:52.493
who helped root out disobedient
shits from here back in the day.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.163
I need an assassin.

31:55.163 --> 31:59.083
Listen, I like being retired.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.503
I get up, I meditate,

32:03.338 --> 32:05.089
then I get to go out
and find people who need help

32:05.173 --> 32:08.885
and give them a second chance.
It's Zen, it feels great.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.219
And it can be taken from you.

32:14.599 --> 32:21.147
Are you, um, tired of living, Lance?

32:22.815 --> 32:23.983
Hmm?

32:36.579 --> 32:38.957
Most of the dead troopers
are kids in their 20s.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.505
That's on me. I need to make it right.

32:51.177 --> 32:54.514
Okay. Okay.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.309
What are you thinking?

33:01.437 --> 33:03.564
- How's Aaron working out?
- He's great.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.025
He instantly connects with people.
Makes my job easy.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.736
Great. Do you know
about his buddy, the priest?

33:08.820 --> 33:09.862
Stokes.

33:09.946 --> 33:10.947
Oh.

33:11.614 --> 33:15.076
Okay. Okay. So we go in
like we're making first contact,

33:15.368 --> 33:17.078
and then since they are religious...

33:17.078 --> 33:19.288
Priest gets their guard down,
they let you in.

33:19.914 --> 33:24.502
Go see the big chief
and then do what you do.

33:25.086 --> 33:28.464
And what about when things turn
and I have to tell them what's what?

33:29.090 --> 33:32.176
They'll fall in line. Everyone does.

33:37.932 --> 33:38.975
Sweep the rear.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.110
The guns and the cargo you hijacked,

33:50.653 --> 33:53.573
the ones that you massacred
my soldiers to get to.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.699
Where are they?

33:55.742 --> 33:58.286
I've got no idea
what you're talking about.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.715
Three sets of tracks
led back here from there.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.841
You want to try again?

34:16.804 --> 34:18.347
That caravan...

34:19.599 --> 34:23.102
Yeah, we... We found it like that.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.232
You just lied to me.

34:31.694 --> 34:34.822
Hey, hey! Stop, stop!

34:35.823 --> 34:36.866
Cuff him.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.209
Hey, dickless.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.253
If I found those weapons,
don't you think I...

34:53.007 --> 34:54.717
You made the shelf, warlord.

34:56.177 --> 35:00.056
Top shelf, dead center. How's that sound?

35:01.432 --> 35:02.475
Right above Billy.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.813
Ooh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:06.813 --> 35:10.024
Hey, hey, where'd you go, huh?

35:11.192 --> 35:13.736
All that talk and you died so quick.

35:30.878 --> 35:34.132
Don't you look at me like that.
He's a damn animal.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.301
We are supposed to be helping people.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.513
We are. This is the other side of it.

35:41.848 --> 35:46.686
Snuffing out threats.
This is how we make the world safe.

35:51.732 --> 35:52.859
Hold him.

36:00.366 --> 36:01.409
Pop him.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.348
Oh. Interesting.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.894
Come on. Let's go.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.529
- Can we follow him?
- Sir!

36:44.911 --> 36:47.246
I turn my back for one goddamn minute!

36:57.673 --> 36:58.716
Get me my armor.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.763
He was a wolf,
just like their leader said.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.557
You think he was lying
about the stolen shipments?

37:06.641 --> 37:07.683
I don't know.

37:08.434 --> 37:11.103
What do the Commonwealth
want with all those guns?

37:17.735 --> 37:18.945
This the best way in?

37:21.239 --> 37:23.324
Yeah. Where'd you get that?

37:24.033 --> 37:25.993
You gave it to the guy who rode
into Hilltop.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.120
No, I didn't.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.623
Then who did?

37:37.338 --> 37:39.090
Whoa. Easy, girl.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.636
Don't move.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.933
How many of you are there?

37:50.601 --> 37:53.312
- Twelve.
- What are they armed with?

37:54.355 --> 37:55.398
Machine guns.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.359
I didn't know. I didn't know.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.153
What's it look like?

38:01.779 --> 38:05.283
A lot dead. Guy in charge
is arguing with two others,

38:05.283 --> 38:07.576
a priest and a guy
with a spiked ball for an arm.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.205
- Shit. Gabriel and Aaron.
- You know them?

38:11.998 --> 38:13.082
They didn't know either.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.543
We come from a place
called the Commonwealth.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.545
- This isn't what I signed up for.
- Shut up.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.005
Mmm-hmm.

38:26.387 --> 38:30.725
There's a community right here.
You ask for Maggie, no one else.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.394
You tell her Gabriel
and Aaron are in trouble.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.646
Go. Go.

38:35.855 --> 38:36.981
Uh-huh.

38:41.110 --> 38:45.781
This is the other side of it.
Snuffing out threats.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.826
This is how to make the world safe.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.096
- Negan?
- Gabe.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.605
Interesting.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.273
Ain't you coming? We gotta go.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.443
- We gotta go.
- We can't leave him.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.362
You go out there, we all die. Come on.

39:30.826 --> 39:31.869
Sir!

39:37.875 --> 39:40.252
I turn my back for one goddamn minute!

40:02.149 --> 40:04.110
Residents of the complex,

40:05.736 --> 40:09.073
you have been deemed enemies
of the Commonwealth.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.243
One of you has stolen from us.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.246
That cannot stand.

40:16.789 --> 40:19.708
Bad news is your warlord is dead.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.588
Good news is you still
can make things right.

40:25.589 --> 40:30.428
Give us what's ours and we'll leave.
That'll be that.

40:30.886 --> 40:32.847
- Where are the weapons?
- I don't know.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.390
Then ask them quickly.

40:34.557 --> 40:37.435
Gabe, if she says they don't have them,

40:37.435 --> 40:38.936
they don't have them.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.521
You don't understand.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.774
I'm praying that you did steal them,
because without them, we're dead.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.776
He's not gonna let any of us
leave here alive.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.163
Where are my weapons?

40:59.123 --> 41:00.249
I don't know.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.628
- You really don't, do you?
- No.

41:06.422 --> 41:09.341
Okay, I believe you.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.313
And how about you?

41:24.607 --> 41:25.608
Mmm.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.371
Please, don't. No, no, no.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.251
Please, don't. No, no, no.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.761
Your people have let you down.

41:57.389 --> 42:00.851
Hit each room
and kill anyone who won't talk.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.102
Copy that.

42:08.651 --> 42:11.529
What we need to do now is stick together.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.658
You can forget about giving up
or begging for forgiveness.

42:16.492 --> 42:20.412
Ian's dead,
but he wasn't our first leader.

42:21.455 --> 42:24.750
He wasn't what kept us together
this long. We did.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.253
And we did it
by working together as a family.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.173
And right now our family's
scattered all over this building.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.758
But you know what?

42:32.758 --> 42:35.886
We know this place better
than the assholes in our house do.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.181
We're coming out of this on top.

42:47.898 --> 42:51.193
So that was, um... that's pretty good.

42:52.069 --> 42:55.114
They took out our best.

42:56.323 --> 42:57.908
Yeah, but they needed to hear it.

43:00.953 --> 43:03.289
<i>Hodges, come in.
Is the east end clear?</i>

43:08.210 --> 43:09.628
<i>Hodges, do you copy?</i>

43:12.881 --> 43:14.300
<i>Is the east end...</i>
