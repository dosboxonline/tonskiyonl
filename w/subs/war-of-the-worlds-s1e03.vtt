WEBVTT

00:34.801 --> 00:35.921
Minister.

00:36.081 --> 00:36.721
Anything?

00:37.480 --> 00:39.080
We still haven't been able to make contact

00:39.110 --> 00:40.200
Northwood or Whitehall.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.020
Someone's going to have to go out there

00:43.040 --> 00:44.440
and find out what's happening.

00:45.881 --> 00:47.281
Do we ask for volunteers?

00:48.481 --> 00:50.201
I think you just give the order.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.300
What have I told you about
running in the corridors?

00:58.801 --> 00:59.721
Stop running.

01:02.721 --> 01:05.041
They're going stir crazy cooped up in here.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.241
What are you telling them?

01:06.401 --> 01:07.441
For right now, nothing.

01:08.721 --> 01:10.161
What am I supposed to tell them?

01:10.840 --> 01:13.780
Everyone they know, all their family,
their friends, probably all dead.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.841
I'm sorry. That was insensitive. I...

01:23.521 --> 01:24.361
How are you doing?

01:30.681 --> 01:32.201
It doesn't seem real, you know?

01:35.041 --> 01:37.081
Maybe it's not as bad as we think.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.201
Helen?

04:28.961 --> 04:30.001
Helen?

04:39.401 --> 04:40.161
What's wrong?

04:43.241 --> 04:44.521
I thought you'd gone without me.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.281
I was just looking in the shed.

04:47.441 --> 04:49.081
Why would I leave without you?

04:50.480 --> 04:51.050
Right.

04:51.070 --> 04:53.120
We've still got a long way to go. Come on.

05:04.641 --> 05:05.281
Mum?

05:05.881 --> 05:07.561
-What's wrong?
- Nothing.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.121
Get your stuff. We're going.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.620
Why are we going out this way?

05:22.630 --> 05:23.590
We just are.

05:24.161 --> 05:25.161
Come on.

05:45.330 --> 05:46.710
Have you been able to sleep?

05:46.740 --> 05:47.800
A little.

05:48.790 --> 05:49.560
And you?

05:49.580 --> 05:50.900
Not really.

05:56.862 --> 05:59.322
Seen from here we could almost forget.

06:03.208 --> 06:06.648
Do you have any family besides your sister?

06:08.577 --> 06:12.537
Our parents died in a car accident
when she was twelve.

06:14.570 --> 06:15.860
I'm sorry.

06:15.980 --> 06:18.700
It was a long time ago.

06:22.453 --> 06:24.323
Did you raise her?

06:26.360 --> 06:27.450
Not easy.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.840
Especially for her.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.960
She never really got over it.

06:33.111 --> 06:35.821
Colonel, Doctor...excuse me.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.100
Is it the same everywhere?

06:41.226 --> 06:44.516
There are probably remote places
where they have not landed.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.710
Maybe they don't know anything about it

06:47.750 --> 06:50.040
and life goes on like normal.

06:50.808 --> 06:52.358
I hope so.

06:56.631 --> 06:57.811
What is that?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.140
Where is it coming from?

07:03.180 --> 07:05.640
It's the same frequency again.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.830
Is that music?

07:07.870 --> 07:09.430
That's really weird.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.940
Still from the Northwest?
-Yes.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.960
I'll try to clean up the signal.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.160
What's going on?

08:20.280 --> 08:22.000
That song.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.040
That's the one we sent into space.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.620
I chose it.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.800
That's how they found us.

08:34.355 --> 08:36.235
This is our fault.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.280
What will we do when we get home?

08:41.441 --> 08:43.721
I don't know. Maybe we can
find out what's happening.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.081
How?

08:45.401 --> 08:46.481
I don't know.

08:48.961 --> 08:49.961
Mum?

08:50.160 --> 08:50.790
Mum?

08:50.820 --> 08:51.780
What? What is it now?

08:51.780 --> 08:52.490
Hey!

08:52.961 --> 08:53.841
Who's that?

08:54.481 --> 08:55.761
It's a doctor.

08:55.820 --> 08:56.600
Hey, are you guys okay?

08:56.620 --> 08:58.240
- You're not hurt or anything?
- No.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.120
Good, 'cause there's fuck all I could
have done about it if you were.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.730
You're not a doctor?

09:02.780 --> 09:04.380
No, I'm just a porter.

09:04.410 --> 09:07.280
My other clothes had shit and puke
all over them so I just, ah...

09:07.360 --> 09:09.240
Just rocking the look.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.660
Here...you're a mum, yeah?

09:11.561 --> 09:13.441
You know about babies and stuff?

09:14.441 --> 09:15.961
I could really use your help, right now.

09:17.281 --> 09:19.441
I'd love to help but we're heading home.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.020
My Mum's not big on helping people.

09:22.050 --> 09:23.240
Oh...

09:23.441 --> 09:24.681
Well...please?

09:27.921 --> 09:29.121
Do you want me to beg?

09:37.801 --> 09:38.961
It's just through here.

09:41.801 --> 09:43.121
I'm Ash, by the way.

09:43.761 --> 09:47.441
This place has been absolutely
mental the last few days.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.060
I've cleared all the bodies.

09:49.100 --> 09:49.860
It was horrible.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.560
You don't want to go through those doors.

09:53.521 --> 09:55.721
Where are all the doctors and nurses?

09:55.960 --> 09:58.700
Well, there was a surgeon
and a few nurses, but...

09:58.800 --> 10:00.800
they left to find their families.

10:01.081 --> 10:04.201
Help yourself to snacks and drinks and all.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.400
- Where are you taking us?
- To the basement.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.720
It's the safest place in the building.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.000
When the backup generator survived

10:17.640 --> 10:19.060
we're pretty much the only place

10:19.080 --> 10:20.520
around here that still has lights.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.361
Some people show up

10:23.521 --> 10:25.001
looking for help, but, ah...

10:25.881 --> 10:27.161
I've got some medicine,

10:27.641 --> 10:29.321
a few medical books...

10:30.361 --> 10:32.201
You just have to do your best, right?

10:33.481 --> 10:34.801
I'm just down here

10:35.561 --> 10:37.081
Into this corridor.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.400
Oh...there he is, the big boy.

11:01.380 --> 11:02.801
You've been looking after all of them?

11:02.900 --> 11:05.521
Yeah, I tried to get as many
of them down here as I could.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.060
There was 11 to begin with,

11:07.090 --> 11:09.240
some of them
their parents came and got them.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.601
These guys...

11:12.401 --> 11:14.241
I guess their parents aren't coming.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.040
Well, it's all taken off, though.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.360
There isn't a second when
one of them doesn't need

11:19.360 --> 11:21.760
feeding, or changing, or at least holding.

11:23.521 --> 11:25.001
I'm running on empty.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.150
So what do you guys reckon?

11:28.180 --> 11:29.480
Can you help me out here for a little bit?

11:30.881 --> 11:32.481
Just for like a day.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.441
Half a day, even?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.920
I just need a couple of hours
to get my head down.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.180
Yeah, we can't...

11:40.640 --> 11:42.220
We need to head back.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.560
I need to get them home.

11:44.321 --> 11:45.841
It's not I don't want to.

11:46.001 --> 11:47.361
But, you're not going to.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.290
Mum!

11:48.320 --> 11:49.280
It's cool. I get it.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.260
Got to look after Number One, right?

11:51.300 --> 11:52.760
I'm looking after my kids.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.081
Let's go.

11:57.241 --> 11:58.241
Mum...

11:58.841 --> 12:01.001
half a day is not going to make a difference.

12:01.161 --> 12:02.201
I know...

12:02.361 --> 12:03.761
What's going on?

12:05.241 --> 12:06.641
This isn't you.

12:41.521 --> 12:42.521
Shit!

12:45.281 --> 12:46.361
I don't understand. What?.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.320
- Hey, get under the car.
- Wait.

13:59.281 --> 14:00.761
What the fuck was that?

14:01.160 --> 14:02.870
Are you going to wait for it to come back?

14:02.900 --> 14:03.720
Come on.

14:33.841 --> 14:35.281
Oh my God!

14:37.161 --> 14:38.161
Helen.

14:49.361 --> 14:51.481
Oh my God!
What happened?

14:57.961 --> 14:58.921
Dan?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.001
Helen!

16:28.640 --> 16:29.580
What the hell is that?

16:31.601 --> 16:32.961
I have no idea.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.241
Hello?

17:00.161 --> 17:01.161
I heard shooting.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.340
It's okay, it's okay.

17:03.370 --> 17:04.240
It's dead.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.281
Whatever it is.

17:16.521 --> 17:17.441
Bill!

17:30.281 --> 17:31.481
What happened?

17:34.241 --> 17:35.801
Those things...

17:36.680 --> 17:38.020
they got into the bunker

17:38.040 --> 17:39.280
and they killed everyone.

17:39.441 --> 17:40.641
They killed my children.

17:42.721 --> 17:44.601
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.270
I was in the safe room and
couldn't get to them.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.600
I couldn't...

17:52.681 --> 17:53.721
They were...

17:54.481 --> 17:55.961
hiding underneath the bed.

17:56.121 --> 17:58.281
They must have been so scared.

18:00.241 --> 18:02.121
I should have been with them.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.201
We're looking for our son.

18:14.281 --> 18:15.721
Daniel Ward.

18:16.201 --> 18:17.601
He worked for you?

18:17.880 --> 18:19.720
You're Dan's parents?

18:21.720 --> 18:23.150
Some people made it out.

18:23.170 --> 18:23.960
Dan was with them.

18:26.201 --> 18:27.241
Where would he have gone?

18:27.641 --> 18:28.761
I don't know.

18:32.041 --> 18:33.281
I thought they'd be safe.

18:38.241 --> 18:39.881
I have to bury them.

18:42.721 --> 18:43.921
But I can't.

18:46.441 --> 18:47.481
We'll help you.

18:57.940 --> 18:59.020
He's alive.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.260
Jesus.

19:00.290 --> 19:01.360
Where would he go?

19:01.410 --> 19:02.530
I don't know.

19:04.081 --> 19:05.801
Maybe he's looking for us.

19:06.121 --> 19:07.561
But he's alive.

19:08.161 --> 19:09.521
We're going to find him.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.820
I can't begin to imagine

19:14.840 --> 19:16.520
what she must be going through.

19:20.721 --> 19:22.041
I'll dig...

19:22.641 --> 19:24.001
you keep watch.

19:37.361 --> 19:38.321
What?

19:39.921 --> 19:42.321
I really thought I was going to die.

19:59.761 --> 20:01.481
Rachel, it's ready.

20:03.961 --> 20:05.561
Do you believe there's a God?

20:10.921 --> 20:11.641
No.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.241
Maybe it's easier if you believe in something.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.800
Can I ask you to do something?

20:25.841 --> 20:27.401
Yes, of course. Anything.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.121
Will you bury me with my children?

20:30.440 --> 20:32.200
- No
- Oh no, please!

20:32.721 --> 20:33.961
You shouldn't have to see this.

20:34.121 --> 20:35.321
No, Rachael, put the gun down.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.460
Not like this.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.281
What would you do?

20:49.321 --> 20:50.841
I hope you find Dan.

20:52.561 --> 20:53.881
I always liked him.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.361
There's nothing you can say.

21:21.241 --> 21:22.321
I'm sorry.

21:38.801 --> 21:41.601
"The rabbit hole went straight on

21:41.761 --> 21:43.761
"like a tunnel in some way

21:44.441 --> 21:46.561
"and then dipped suddenly down

21:48.921 --> 21:50.121
"so suddenly

21:50.521 --> 21:54.121
"yet Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself

21:55.401 --> 21:57.721
"before she found herself falling down

21:57.881 --> 22:01.401
"what seemed to be a very deep well.

22:02.601 --> 22:04.881
"Either the well was very deep,

22:05.281 --> 22:06.961
"or she fell very slowly

22:08.240 --> 22:09.730
"for she had plenty of time

22:09.750 --> 22:11.480
as she went down to look about her

22:12.321 --> 22:14.841
"and to wonder what was
going to happen next."

22:27.041 --> 22:29.121
What do you think Dad's going to do?

22:31.161 --> 22:32.801
Do you think he'll head home?

22:35.201 --> 22:37.841
It's going to take him a while
to get back from France.

22:47.921 --> 22:50.121
I remember feeding you in the night.

22:51.481 --> 22:53.881
It's like there was no one else in the world.

22:55.161 --> 22:56.681
Just you and me.

22:59.241 --> 23:01.841
You had this really thick, dark hair.

23:03.201 --> 23:04.561
You looked like a little boy.

23:11.481 --> 23:12.561
Mum?

23:14.041 --> 23:14.961
What is it?

23:16.241 --> 23:18.681
I don't know if I'm making the right choices.

23:18.841 --> 23:19.881
That's okay.

23:20.761 --> 23:23.121
I've always tried to do what's
best for you but...

23:23.521 --> 23:25.081
Nothing's the same any more.

23:25.761 --> 23:27.561
No one knows what they're doing.

23:29.521 --> 23:30.801
Everyone's just...

23:31.881 --> 23:33.401
making it up as they go.

23:34.201 --> 23:36.281
That's not really my style is it?

23:37.281 --> 23:39.041
Maybe you can make a list

23:39.321 --> 23:41.001
so you can tick things off.

23:42.001 --> 23:43.441
Stay Alive. Tick.

23:45.481 --> 23:46.881
That's not funny.

23:47.241 --> 23:49.241
You got us into the underground.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.521
This little one...

24:00.041 --> 24:02.321
she'll never know her parents.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.321
What is it?

24:20.321 --> 24:22.001
I can hear it again.

24:25.481 --> 24:26.521
Emily?

24:31.281 --> 24:32.841
I saw light!

24:50.081 --> 24:51.121
Let me help you.

24:55.441 --> 24:56.281
What the fuck!

25:03.121 --> 25:04.641
I saw a light!

25:05.040 --> 25:07.401
Love, I'm not sure that's possible.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.700
I know what I saw.

25:09.121 --> 25:10.001
Mum!

25:11.121 --> 25:12.041
Mum!

25:13.400 --> 25:15.190
The guy who got stabbed in the shop...

25:15.200 --> 25:15.920
he's here.

25:16.081 --> 25:17.761
What? Are you sure it's him?

25:17.921 --> 25:20.601
Yeah. He's in the corridor on a trolley.

25:20.761 --> 25:22.081
Did he see you?

25:22.241 --> 25:23.241
Yeah.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.321
What are you doing?

25:30.760 --> 25:32.230
Get back on the trolley.

25:32.290 --> 25:33.720
You need rest, brother.

25:37.041 --> 25:37.961
What's going on?

25:38.241 --> 25:40.321
He pointed a gun at my daughter.

25:40.641 --> 25:41.481
Is that true?

25:43.001 --> 25:44.161
What the fuck?

25:45.840 --> 25:47.750
Look, whatever's happened...

25:47.800 --> 25:50.280
you leave it outside, yeah?

25:50.680 --> 25:52.720
You're no shit to the others in here.

25:52.750 --> 25:53.600
Alright?

25:54.401 --> 25:56.161
You stay away from my family.

27:53.281 --> 27:54.521
What are you doing?

27:55.521 --> 27:57.241
The light is better in here.

28:04.641 --> 28:05.561
It's organic.

28:06.041 --> 28:07.721
It's got some sort of nervous system.

28:07.881 --> 28:10.441
I'm not sure what I expected them to look like.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.340
If it is even them.

28:17.481 --> 28:18.521
What do you mean?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.210
The technology is...

28:21.220 --> 28:23.490
it's obviously more advanced than ours.

28:24.121 --> 28:25.361
But this...

28:26.081 --> 28:27.881
this is relatively primitive.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.441
So you think there's something else?

28:29.601 --> 28:30.841
I don't know, maybe.

28:32.441 --> 28:33.161
This is...

28:35.001 --> 28:37.281
this is a neural cortex.

28:41.161 --> 28:42.681
Do you want me to get rid of that?

28:50.481 --> 28:52.561
So what would you have done
had been Dan?

29:01.001 --> 29:02.121
I don't know.

29:06.921 --> 29:09.161
I don't want that thing in here while we sleep.

29:33.841 --> 29:34.921
You're a natural.

29:36.001 --> 29:37.681
Fake it 'til you make it.

29:41.161 --> 29:43.081
This lad loves his music.

29:43.361 --> 29:44.521
Hushes right up.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.220
Where are your family?

29:54.001 --> 29:54.721
I'm sorry.

29:55.641 --> 29:57.881
I've got to keep my shit together
for these little guys.

30:00.561 --> 30:02.921
Here, now I know you're
not supposed to have favourites...

30:04.801 --> 30:06.881
but there's something about this dude.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.620
Can you give me some light?

31:00.721 --> 31:01.961
What's your name?

31:06.401 --> 31:07.041
Your name?

31:09.801 --> 31:10.921
Jonathan.

31:11.241 --> 31:12.241
I'm Chloé.

31:17.681 --> 31:20.241
I was like you the first time I saw one.

31:21.521 --> 31:22.321
What happened?

31:23.080 --> 31:26.620
I was with some people heading out of Paris

31:26.660 --> 31:30.000
and um...a couple of those things found us.

31:30.481 --> 31:32.241
and they killed them all.

31:32.401 --> 31:33.841
The children too.

31:34.801 --> 31:35.721
Jesus.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.440
So, umm, where are you going?

31:41.161 --> 31:42.281
London.

31:43.161 --> 31:44.561
My family are there.

31:45.361 --> 31:46.321
And you?

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
I'm going to my parents.

31:48.830 --> 31:50.560
It's near d'Amiens.

31:51.361 --> 31:53.521
My son was staying there.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.481
Are we safe here?

31:56.500 --> 31:57.810
We're not safe anywhere,

31:57.830 --> 32:00.280
so we should take turns to stay awake.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.800
I'll start. You can have some sleep.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.060
So sorry.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.161
I didn't mean to scare you.

33:45.961 --> 33:47.041
What's wrong?

33:49.520 --> 33:51.180
My sight's come back.

33:53.081 --> 33:54.561
I can see.

34:06.281 --> 34:07.281
Emily?

34:09.121 --> 34:10.121
Tom!

34:11.121 --> 34:12.400
Tom, where's Emily?

34:13.081 --> 34:14.041
Em!

34:17.281 --> 34:18.400
What's going on?

34:18.561 --> 34:20.201
I can't find my daughter.

34:24.001 --> 34:26.481
It's not like my sight was before.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.321
It's different.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.601
It's so weird.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.641
Do my eyes look normal?

34:42.201 --> 34:43.440
Ah, I think so.

34:47.521 --> 34:48.440
Get away from her!

34:48.601 --> 34:49.601
Mum, it's okay.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.000
What are you doing?

34:51.001 --> 34:52.081
Mum, listen.

34:54.321 --> 34:55.201
I can see.

34:57.481 --> 34:58.201
What?

34:59.481 --> 35:00.841
I can see you.

35:01.321 --> 35:03.321
My sight's come back.

35:03.721 --> 35:04.681
What?

35:07.401 --> 35:08.481
Tom.

35:12.161 --> 35:13.201
What are they firing at?

35:13.361 --> 35:14.761
We need to go downstairs.

35:15.881 --> 35:16.961
Mum...

35:20.801 --> 35:21.721
Come on.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.321
What's wrong?

35:24.561 --> 35:25.681
Last night, I...

35:26.761 --> 35:29.001
I saw a woman. She was running.

35:29.801 --> 35:31.641
I think something was chasing her.

35:32.001 --> 35:33.001
What was it?

35:37.121 --> 35:38.481
Oh, I don't know...I...

35:39.321 --> 35:41.321
I don't think it was human.

35:42.481 --> 35:44.481
Okay, now you're really freaking me out.

35:45.201 --> 35:46.841
Do you think it was them?

35:48.320 --> 35:50.040
The guns I had when you found me...

35:50.070 --> 35:51.240
where are they?

36:02.961 --> 36:04.321
Were you a soldier or something?

36:08.201 --> 36:10.801
You're not taking these fucking off
and leaving us are you?

36:11.321 --> 36:13.041
I have nowhere else to go.

36:13.201 --> 36:14.401
Okay, good.

36:15.321 --> 36:16.401
Just checking.

37:37.561 --> 37:38.881
Christ!

37:39.801 --> 37:40.841
I thought you'd gone.

37:41.521 --> 37:42.561
You want something?

37:43.040 --> 37:44.760
Do you think it'll do any good?

37:45.481 --> 37:47.401
Well, I'm pretty sure it's better than nothing.

37:54.721 --> 37:56.521
You shouted in your sleep.

37:57.841 --> 37:58.881
You scared the life out of me.

37:59.601 --> 38:01.921
Oh yeah? What was I saying?

38:02.561 --> 38:03.881
Oh, it was in French.

38:06.281 --> 38:07.521
So you leaving?

38:08.081 --> 38:09.161
Yes.

38:11.881 --> 38:12.881
Good luck.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.201
You too.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.721
We could walk some of the way together.

38:20.921 --> 38:23.201
We are both going North, so...

38:26.320 --> 38:27.450
Only if you want to.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.000
Oh yeah, I want to, I just...

38:29.020 --> 38:30.880
You know, I wasn't sure whether to ask.

38:34.681 --> 38:36.161
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

38:47.761 --> 38:49.921
Yeah, you look fucked!

38:51.321 --> 38:53.201
You go and get some rest, lad.

38:53.801 --> 38:55.161
I've got this.

39:01.961 --> 39:04.401
So why do you think they're trying to kill us?

39:05.481 --> 39:07.561
Maybe because we're different to them.

39:10.201 --> 39:11.761
Surely, there's more to it than that, huh?

39:12.521 --> 39:14.201
Sometimes, it's enough.

39:17.001 --> 39:18.681
You know how to use this?

39:18.921 --> 39:20.641
Mate, I don't have a Scooby.

39:21.800 --> 39:22.700
Scooby Doo.

39:22.721 --> 39:24.441
It means click like I don't have a clue.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.300
Well, you need to get a Scooby.

39:27.340 --> 39:28.480
Oh yeah, I'll tell you that.

39:31.281 --> 39:32.401
It doesn't matter.

39:32.561 --> 39:34.121
It's extremely easy going there.

40:45.321 --> 40:47.921
They used other bunkers in Whitehall.

40:48.401 --> 40:50.881
I'm with you, I think he'd go home.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.580
If he's not there, we'll go to this other bunker.

40:55.481 --> 40:56.521
What?

40:58.641 --> 40:59.481
Nothing.

41:00.361 --> 41:01.481
We should go.

41:06.401 --> 41:07.441
Bill?

41:26.561 --> 41:27.481
What?

41:31.641 --> 41:33.121
I've found Dan.

41:45.881 --> 41:47.281
Em, what's wrong?

41:48.460 --> 41:49.500
- Listen.
- I can't...

41:50.760 --> 41:52.920
I can't see anything.

41:56.641 --> 41:59.041
I woke up and I couldn't see.

42:04.281 --> 42:05.401
Well, maybe...

42:05.761 --> 42:08.481
Maybe it was just your mind
playing tricks on you.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.150
What, you don't believe me?

42:10.170 --> 42:11.320
Of course, I do.

42:11.481 --> 42:13.401
- You think I imagined it?
- No.

42:13.561 --> 42:15.041
No, I'd never think that.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.800
What's happening to me?

42:20.561 --> 42:21.761
I don't know.

43:55.921 --> 43:56.961
Helen?

44:19.081 --> 44:20.721
Helen! Open the door!

44:22.921 --> 44:24.201
Open the door!

44:27.801 --> 44:28.881
Why was the door locked?

44:31.440 --> 44:33.680
You always said you could
create things in a lab.

44:34.361 --> 44:35.881
Biological weapons?

44:36.521 --> 44:38.081
Theoretically, yes.

44:38.721 --> 44:41.281
And those machines are organic inside?

44:43.800 --> 44:45.440
Yes, as far as I understand.

44:46.801 --> 44:49.561
I want you to find a way to kill
every last one of them.

44:52.281 --> 44:53.441
Okay.
