03:25.461 --> 03:28.005
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

03:28.214 --> 03:29.486
It's on its way.

03:42.877 --> 03:43.695
Ray?

03:47.275 --> 03:49.228
I need you back in four instead of 12.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.818
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

03:50.820 --> 03:51.956
No, no, no, I can't.

03:51.958 --> 03:54.240
I'm on a 12-hour blow.
Call Tedesco.

03:54.449 --> 03:57.446
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

03:57.577 --> 03:59.704
I got to have somebody
who can do double picks.

03:59.821 --> 04:01.234
I wish I could help you, Sal.

04:01.925 --> 04:03.389
It's the goddamn union regulations.

04:03.541 --> 04:05.556
Come on.
I'm in a position here, Ray.

04:05.918 --> 04:08.096
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

04:09.359 --> 04:11.190
You know what your problem is?

04:11.582 --> 04:13.785
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.060
8:30? Did we say that?

04:40.495 --> 04:41.701
We said 8:00.

04:44.123 --> 04:45.301
Hey, this is

04:46.485 --> 04:49.283
This is one safe-looking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

04:49.754 --> 04:51.164
Congratulations.
Thank you.

04:54.829 --> 04:55.881
Eight o'clock?

04:57.637 --> 05:00.217
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.213
There he is.

05:07.245 --> 05:08.268
Get a hug?

05:10.174 --> 05:11.246
Confusing handshake?

05:11.967 --> 05:13.137
Kick in the teeth?

05:14.385 --> 05:15.406
The door's locked.

05:16.531 --> 05:17.907
Still working on those manners?

05:19.901 --> 05:20.806
Hello, Dad.

05:22.745 --> 05:23.662
Hello, Rachel.

05:36.843 --> 05:37.806
Here, honey.

05:38.047 --> 05:39.960
Let me give you
a hand getting that inside.

05:39.966 --> 05:40.972
The door's locked.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.054
Let me get it.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.698
I don't mind. I don't mind.

05:43.699 --> 05:45.158
Hey she said, she could get it.
I got it. I got it.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.426
It's heavy.
She said she could get it.

05:46.428 --> 05:47.815
Just get it to the door.
It's got rollers.

05:47.878 --> 05:49.343
Just roll, roll it.
Yeah.

05:49.344 --> 05:51.237
But we can't roll it up the stairs, can we?

05:51.649 --> 05:52.913
Baby, I got it from here, ok?

06:00.322 --> 06:01.813
It's a 302 V8. It's...

06:02.744 --> 06:03.847
It's gonna be out of here next week.

06:07.248 --> 06:09.133
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

06:11.496 --> 06:12.612
You're out of milk.

06:14.172 --> 06:15.423
And everything else.

06:16.257 --> 06:16.920
Yeah.

06:16.921 --> 06:18.261
Could you close the door, please?

06:18.398 --> 06:20.332
Because that's my refrigerator.

06:21.850 --> 06:23.484
I'm gonna go wait outside.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.011
Ok, sweetheart.

06:27.757 --> 06:28.811
I'll see you in a few days.

06:29.437 --> 06:30.352
Bye, Tim.

06:31.814 --> 06:33.337
I better get this upstairs.
Let me...

06:33.634 --> 06:34.598
Let me get...

06:36.194 --> 06:37.446
Mom, Mom, Mom.
Mary Ann.

06:37.521 --> 06:38.625
Ok, ok.
Mom.

06:38.717 --> 06:39.740
Ok.
Mom,

06:52.752 --> 06:54.603
A little old to be sharing,
aren't they?

06:54.680 --> 06:56.793
I don't hear any complaints.
No, I do.

07:03.805 --> 07:04.937
Robbie's got a paper,

07:05.281 --> 07:08.062
on the French occupation
of Algeria due Monday,

07:08.387 --> 07:09.693
which he's yet to begin.

07:10.395 --> 07:12.658
It'd be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

07:12.659 --> 07:14.775
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

07:15.650 --> 07:16.828
I just got to type it up.

07:16.906 --> 07:17.437
No.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.819
You just got to start writing it first.
I love you, Mom.

07:21.239 --> 07:22.184
I love you.

07:24.867 --> 07:25.783
Listen to your father.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.808
Oh, no shoes on the bed.

07:30.873 --> 07:33.167
We'll be at my parents' house in Boston,

07:33.418 --> 07:35.294
but don't call the house line,
you know they...

07:35.503 --> 07:38.463
The point is, I've got my cell
phone, so if anything comes up or...

07:38.564 --> 07:39.965
you have any questions,
just call me.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.527
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

07:42.009 --> 07:43.720
I'll leave the phone on.
Mary Ann.

07:45.430 --> 07:46.858
It's a good look for you.

07:49.851 --> 07:50.728
You think?

07:53.020 --> 07:53.676
Yeah.

07:56.357 --> 07:57.671
Take care of our kids.

07:58.871 --> 08:00.674
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

08:01.293 --> 08:02.999
Listen you, tell your mom that...

08:03.283 --> 08:04.967
Ray sends his love and kisses.

08:07.566 --> 08:08.276
Right.

08:08.574 --> 08:09.914
She'll love that.

08:18.436 --> 08:21.648
<i>The Ukraine, a country
of some 52 million people,</i>

08:21.650 --> 08:23.459
<i>is in almost total blackness tonight,</i>

08:23.718 --> 08:26.099
<i>in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms</i>

08:26.137 --> 08:27.855
<i>of catastrophic proportion,</i>

08:28.014 --> 08:30.871
<i>which struck the country at
approximately 4 a.m. local time.</i>

08:33.644 --> 08:36.653
<i>EMP or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a</i>

08:36.654 --> 08:40.083
<i>temporary interruption of all
electrical current within its field.</i>

08:40.476 --> 08:43.804
<i>As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the EMP here</i>

08:43.946 --> 08:47.366
<i>was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,</i>

08:47.457 --> 08:50.155
<i>measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.</i>

08:50.382 --> 08:51.194
<i>This...</i>

08:54.293 --> 08:55.355
Baseball season's over.

08:55.565 --> 08:57.159
Five minutes.
It's not gonna kill you.

09:00.309 --> 09:01.381
There he is.

09:06.594 --> 09:07.399
Boston.

09:09.430 --> 09:10.361
That's how it is?

09:13.340 --> 09:14.496
Is that how it's gonna be?

09:18.314 --> 09:19.360
Careful with that throw.

09:19.361 --> 09:20.571
Whatever, Ray.

09:21.609 --> 09:22.682
Mom says you got
a report due on monday,

09:22.993 --> 09:24.952
So you're gonna, work on that
when we're done here.

09:25.012 --> 09:27.247
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just got to type it up.

09:27.747 --> 09:28.603
Yeah, bullshit.

09:30.443 --> 09:31.389
Yeah?

09:32.296 --> 09:33.361
What do you know, Ray?

09:33.920 --> 09:36.024
Everything. Haven't you heard?
Between me and my brother,

09:36.665 --> 09:37.697
we know everything.

09:39.885 --> 09:41.424
What's the capital of Australia?

09:43.013 --> 09:44.299
That's one my brother knows.

09:46.766 --> 09:50.281
Ok with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

09:53.273 --> 09:54.396
Just do your report.

09:54.503 --> 09:56.420
We don't send you to school
so you can flunk out.

09:57.694 --> 09:59.078
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

10:05.827 --> 10:06.948
That's half what I've got.

10:08.038 --> 10:09.174
You're an asshole.

10:09.641 --> 10:10.787
I hate coming here.

10:11.541 --> 10:12.860
That why you act like such a dick?

10:29.267 --> 10:30.014
What?

10:31.144 --> 10:32.822
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

10:33.813 --> 10:35.804
If you want him to listen to you...
What are you,

10:35.805 --> 10:37.272
your mother or mine?

10:39.583 --> 10:40.462
Where are you going?

10:40.463 --> 10:41.481
I'm going to sleep.

10:42.322 --> 10:43.484
I work for a living.

10:45.450 --> 10:47.035
What are we supposed to eat?
You know,

10:47.754 --> 10:48.520
order.

11:13.186 --> 11:16.021
<i>Three and two...</i>

11:17.190 --> 11:19.191
<i>Electromagnetic storm...
The storms were tracked...</i>

11:19.275 --> 11:21.148
<i>And I'll have my own little secret.</i>

11:21.149 --> 11:22.991
<i>Good idea, hey, Gary?</i>

11:23.738 --> 11:24.594
<i>No.</i>

11:24.595 --> 11:26.031
<i>No. What do you know?</i>

11:26.116 --> 11:27.253
<i>You're a snail.</i>

11:37.669 --> 11:38.648
What's the matter?

11:39.254 --> 11:40.198
Got a splinter.

11:43.466 --> 11:44.469
Where'd you get it? Come here.

11:46.011 --> 11:47.099
On your porch railing.

11:47.846 --> 11:48.651
Do you need me to...

11:48.652 --> 11:49.560
What?

11:49.867 --> 11:51.557
To do what? You want me to...

11:53.184 --> 11:54.301
You want me to take that out?

11:54.302 --> 11:55.202
Absolutely not.

11:56.014 --> 11:57.097
Come here. Let me see it.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.917
Let me see.

11:59.649 --> 12:00.321
Dad.

12:01.151 --> 12:02.504
Just look. Don't touch it.
Rach.

12:02.613 --> 12:03.538
Dad!
I can't.

12:03.563 --> 12:04.352
You're moving it around.
Ok.

12:04.414 --> 12:05.396
Just look at it.
But don't touch it.

12:05.513 --> 12:06.428
Just look at it.

12:08.027 --> 12:08.997
It's gonna get infected.

12:09.743 --> 12:11.593
No, it won't.
Yes, it's gonna get infected.

12:11.656 --> 12:12.650
No, it won't.

12:13.580 --> 12:14.586
When it's ready,

12:15.135 --> 12:16.801
my body will just push it out.

12:18.161 --> 12:19.054
Push it out?

12:19.437 --> 12:20.291
I read that.

12:23.923 --> 12:25.163
You should get TiVo.

12:26.509 --> 12:27.708
Tim got it for my room.

12:28.189 --> 12:29.228
TiVo?
It's awesome.

12:30.930 --> 12:32.787
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

12:35.101 --> 12:37.644
Yeah, I'll just put it on my platinum card.

12:37.729 --> 12:38.544
Robbie?

12:39.227 --> 12:40.189
Robbie.

12:45.435 --> 12:46.396
What is that?

12:48.073 --> 12:48.833
Hummus.

12:49.991 --> 12:50.758
Hummus?

12:50.759 --> 12:52.182
From the health-food place.

12:53.328 --> 12:55.176
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

12:58.999 --> 13:00.149
You said order.

13:01.878 --> 13:03.579
I meant order food.

13:04.964 --> 13:06.184
Where is Robbie?

13:06.591 --> 13:08.137
He went out.
Out where?

13:09.135 --> 13:09.996
I don't know.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.728
He just took your car and left.

13:45.186 --> 13:46.163
Steven, look at this.

13:46.422 --> 13:48.263
What's up?
Check it out!

13:52.470 --> 13:54.187
You ever see something like that?

13:55.265 --> 13:57.412
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

13:57.976 --> 14:00.244
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.095
You got to come see this!

14:36.097 --> 14:38.179
That is so weird.
What?

14:39.559 --> 14:41.565
The wind is blowing toward the storm.

14:41.895 --> 14:43.233
That is weird.

14:43.956 --> 14:45.010
Hey, watch it!

14:47.859 --> 14:50.019
Rachel, you wanna see something cool?

15:23.967 --> 15:24.952
It's ok.

15:25.939 --> 15:27.377
I wanna go inside.
It's ok.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.283
I wanna go inside.

15:30.735 --> 15:31.821
Ok, you go ahead.

15:34.405 --> 15:36.345
That's enough weather for me.

15:37.283 --> 15:38.675
Don't wanna go by myself.

15:44.165 --> 15:45.336
It's kind of fun, isn't it?

15:45.820 --> 15:46.625
No.

15:47.043 --> 15:48.802
Come on, like
the Fourth of July.

15:49.169 --> 15:50.127
No, it's not.

15:50.129 --> 15:51.373
Oh, say can...

16:02.642 --> 16:03.383
It's ok.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.558
You're fine.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.046
It hit right behind our house.

16:06.047 --> 16:07.104
Yeah, well, it's...

16:07.188 --> 16:08.364
It's not gonna hit there again.

16:08.716 --> 16:11.346
Ok because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place.

16:11.818 --> 16:12.578
Shit!

16:18.616 --> 16:19.423
Where's Robbie?

16:21.828 --> 16:22.653
I don't know.

16:24.706 --> 16:25.727
Is Robbie ok?

16:28.835 --> 16:29.711
Are you ok?

16:30.821 --> 16:31.993
Where's the thunder?

16:33.298 --> 16:34.526
Why won't it stop?

16:49.188 --> 16:50.293
Is it over?

17:06.164 --> 17:07.228
Where are you going?

17:07.582 --> 17:08.136
Just...

17:09.217 --> 17:11.223
I'm just checking things out.
Just wait. Wait there.

17:11.794 --> 17:13.007
Are we gonna be ok?

17:13.369 --> 17:14.237
I don't know.

17:14.589 --> 17:16.553
You don't know?
No, I meant, I just...

17:16.575 --> 17:17.971
Just Rachel, please.

17:18.675 --> 17:20.538
Just stop asking so many questions.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.607
Just wait here.

17:59.926 --> 18:01.261
Turn everything off.

18:02.052 --> 18:03.694
Everything is off.

18:04.222 --> 18:06.428
I can't get one freaking thing to turn on.

18:09.602 --> 18:11.834
You believe this, Ray? Every single car.

18:14.482 --> 18:16.483
Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

18:16.567 --> 18:18.430
The car just stopped, and...
You're ok?

18:18.618 --> 18:20.194
The lightning started to hit
Are you ok? You all right?

18:20.196 --> 18:21.530
About a block away,
over and over again.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.657
And me and this other guy...
Where the hell did you go?

18:23.741 --> 18:24.780
Over on Lincoln Avenue.

18:25.090 --> 18:25.991
Lincoln Avenue?

18:26.411 --> 18:27.788
By the church.
You see it? You saw the lightning?

18:27.790 --> 18:28.542
Were you near it?
Yeah!

18:28.544 --> 18:30.579
26 times we counted,
over and over again.

18:30.581 --> 18:31.521
The lightning started to hit.
Yeah.

18:31.523 --> 18:33.532
It opened up this hole or something.

18:33.534 --> 18:34.183
I don't know.
Twenty-six times?

18:34.185 --> 18:34.974
Yeah.
Ok.

18:36.462 --> 18:38.024
You're ok?
Yeah.

18:38.026 --> 18:39.976
Ok. All right, well your sister
is in the house,

18:40.091 --> 18:43.040
Now I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, ok?

18:43.511 --> 18:45.038
The next time you take my car,

18:45.054 --> 18:47.504
with no driver's license
and no permission,

18:47.723 --> 18:49.307
I call the cops.

18:51.227 --> 18:52.810
You better be there when I get back.

18:54.355 --> 18:55.567
Yeah.
Robbie.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.090
Manny,

19:02.389 --> 19:03.091
Manny.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.573
Manny, what is it, dead?

19:04.657 --> 19:06.347
All of them. Everything. Look at this.

19:07.410 --> 19:08.491
The starter's fried.

19:08.869 --> 19:09.760
Lightning hit it?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.835
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

19:12.290 --> 19:13.613
You got any idea what's going on?

19:13.614 --> 19:14.832
I'm on my way to find out.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.920
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.542
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

19:20.214 --> 19:23.878
Hey, they're saying all the lightning
struck down by the church.

19:35.188 --> 19:37.253
What the hell is going on around here?

19:39.358 --> 19:40.400
Let us through.
Hey.

19:40.818 --> 19:42.110
Let us through here.
Hey, hey.

19:42.195 --> 19:43.219
What up, Ray?

19:44.113 --> 19:45.822
I should have known
you two were behind this.

19:45.907 --> 19:47.908
Hey, God's pissed off
at the neighborhood, Raymond.

19:47.992 --> 19:48.992
I'll tell you that much.
Can you blame him?

19:49.076 --> 19:49.960
You see it?
Yeah.

19:50.035 --> 19:51.762
You got power where you are?
Nope. Nothing.

19:52.663 --> 19:54.122
It's the cars, though.
You know, that's the thing.

19:54.207 --> 19:56.065
Solar flare.
That's what this guy told me he heard.

19:56.323 --> 19:57.062
A solar flare?

19:57.141 --> 19:58.105
Yeah, he says the sun shoots off

19:58.107 --> 19:59.503
these big blobs of plasma.
Let me tell you something.

19:59.587 --> 20:02.130
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

20:02.132 --> 20:04.216
all the electronic stuff like that.
Can I tell you something?

20:04.383 --> 20:06.030
The sun does not cause lightning, ok?

20:06.032 --> 20:07.412
Bro, I'm just telling you
what that guy said he heard.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.873
Ok, I understand, but it just
sounds dumb when you're saying that.

20:16.479 --> 20:18.225
I've never seen anything like this before.

20:18.227 --> 20:20.196
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

20:20.593 --> 20:22.317
Is this the only place?
Come on, put that down.

20:22.319 --> 20:24.124
You wanna step back, please?
Step back.

20:25.071 --> 20:26.392
You're gonna fall in.
Get back.

20:29.408 --> 20:30.420
Back up, people.

20:30.784 --> 20:32.450
People, back up back there.

20:33.829 --> 20:34.793
Move back.

20:35.158 --> 20:36.782
Everybody back up.

20:36.958 --> 20:37.816
Move back.

20:44.257 --> 20:45.021
Is it hot?

20:45.675 --> 20:46.381
No.

20:47.593 --> 20:48.796
It's freezing.

20:49.247 --> 20:49.844
What is that?

20:49.929 --> 20:51.680
Hey, move. You feel that?

20:51.764 --> 20:52.730
I feel that.

20:52.731 --> 20:54.532
Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

20:55.351 --> 20:56.726
You feel that?
Feel that?

20:56.811 --> 20:58.603
Yeah, I feel that.
What is it, the subway?

20:58.688 --> 20:59.954
There's no subway here.

20:59.955 --> 21:01.022
F train, maybe?

21:01.107 --> 21:02.524
That can't be the water main.

21:02.608 --> 21:03.942
There's nothing else down there.

21:04.026 --> 21:05.694
Water main doesn't run through here.
Feel that?

21:05.778 --> 21:07.747
Well, there is something down there
and it's moving.

21:12.827 --> 21:14.138
Everybody, move back.

21:15.496 --> 21:16.304
Back it up.

21:17.002 --> 21:17.924
Everybody, move back.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.145
Let's go.

21:20.459 --> 21:22.711
Come on, folks. Back up. Get back.

21:30.803 --> 21:32.034
Help me out here.

21:32.323 --> 21:33.308
Get back.

21:38.561 --> 21:40.312
Go! Move!
Everybody, get out of the way!

21:40.396 --> 21:43.273
Everyone, back up!
Everyone, clear the intersection!

21:43.357 --> 21:45.551
Get out of the way!
Back up! Back up!

22:04.253 --> 22:05.613
Forget it! Get back!

22:05.614 --> 22:07.735
Get the hell out of the street!

23:15.825 --> 23:16.913
That's my car!

23:54.029 --> 23:54.978
Please! Move! Move!

23:55.346 --> 23:56.362
Move back!

23:56.680 --> 23:57.492
Move.

25:19.031 --> 25:19.883
Watch it!

25:23.035 --> 25:23.945
Oh, my God.

25:26.330 --> 25:27.744
Ray, no. Stay, man.

28:14.915 --> 28:15.880
What happened?

28:18.961 --> 28:19.918
What's going on?

28:21.672 --> 28:22.584
Dad, what's the matter?

28:24.717 --> 28:26.128
What's all that stuff all over you?

28:30.597 --> 28:32.306
Ray.
What's all this stuff?

28:32.328 --> 28:33.184
Hello?

28:34.814 --> 28:35.406
Ray?

29:09.925 --> 29:11.585
We're leaving this house
in 60 seconds.

29:12.431 --> 29:13.455
What? Why?

29:13.457 --> 29:14.759
I have no idea what's going on.

29:14.761 --> 29:17.307
All the food from the refrigerator
and the cupboard and put it in here.

29:17.309 --> 29:18.625
What's going on, just tell me.
Just do it.

29:20.230 --> 29:20.979
Rachel?

29:20.980 --> 29:22.690
Sweetheart.
Dad, you're really scaring me.

29:22.775 --> 29:24.766
I need you to get your suitcase.
Dad. Dad.

29:25.277 --> 29:27.175
The one that you brought,
bring it to me, ok?

29:27.946 --> 29:29.567
Can you just do that for me, darling?

29:30.029 --> 29:30.650
Ok?

29:45.964 --> 29:47.251
I don't think it's a fire.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.808
See? That looks like smoke to me.
What's happening?

29:52.096 --> 29:53.232
I can't tell you now.

29:53.846 --> 29:55.590
We've only got
about another minute.

30:02.231 --> 30:02.824
No please.

30:04.100 --> 30:04.720
Please.

30:11.782 --> 30:12.673
Just keep it down.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.268
Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

30:14.314 --> 30:15.582
Can you please answer me?

30:17.955 --> 30:19.270
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

30:25.254 --> 30:26.754
Whose car is this?
Just get in.

30:26.839 --> 30:27.852
Whose car is this?

30:31.343 --> 30:32.154
Hey. Hey, Ray.

30:32.513 --> 30:33.928
You were absolutely right.

30:34.012 --> 30:36.092
That is exact I had
to change the solenoid.

30:37.683 --> 30:38.415
Ray?

30:38.529 --> 30:39.279
Hey.

30:39.674 --> 30:40.369
Hey, Ray?

30:40.698 --> 30:41.467
Ray.

30:43.188 --> 30:43.934
Ray.

30:45.691 --> 30:47.219
What? Come on, open up.

30:47.443 --> 30:48.768
Open the door, come on.

30:49.236 --> 30:50.332
Open the door, Ray.

30:51.135 --> 30:52.262
What are...
Get in, Manny.

30:52.317 --> 30:53.539
That's funny.
You got to get out of the car.

30:53.541 --> 30:54.777
You get out, it's not my car.
Manny, get in the car.

30:54.778 --> 30:55.949
It's not your car, ok.
Manny, listen to me, pal.

30:55.951 --> 30:56.920
Daddy's acting crazy Kids.
Manny?

30:56.922 --> 30:57.937
Manny. Manny, shut up.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.153
It's crazy, please get out.
Get in Manny.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.370
Guy's gonna come back,
he's not gonna...

31:00.372 --> 31:02.121
Manny. Manny,
I don't have time to explain.

31:02.123 --> 31:03.773
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

31:03.791 --> 31:05.250
Manny, listen to me.
No, Ray. Get out of the

31:05.252 --> 31:06.820
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

31:07.838 --> 31:09.084
What do you mean?
Ok.

31:11.216 --> 31:12.896
All right, get out of the truck.
I'm not kidding now.

31:12.898 --> 31:13.996
Get out of the car, Ray.

31:14.527 --> 31:16.315
I'm not gonna get in. I'm not getting in.

31:16.453 --> 31:18.140
Manny, get in with us.
I'm not gonna get in trouble.

31:19.391 --> 31:21.906
Look, I'm not fooling around
Close the door. Close it.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.491
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.

31:25.492 --> 31:26.179
It's not...

31:31.987 --> 31:33.194
Get down Rach! Get down!

31:33.196 --> 31:34.087
Get down!

31:34.573 --> 31:35.638
Is it the terrorists?

31:35.908 --> 31:37.169
Just get down, both down!

31:37.170 --> 31:38.017
Get down!

32:11.026 --> 32:12.761
Where are we going?
We got to go.

32:13.395 --> 32:15.196
We got, maybe like
the only working car around here.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.587
I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
Clear of what?

32:18.450 --> 32:19.966
We got to go.
What the hell is going on?

32:19.968 --> 32:21.375
Look you saw, we're under attack!

32:21.376 --> 32:22.112
By who?

32:22.537 --> 32:23.871
Who is attacking us?

32:23.956 --> 32:26.310
Rachel?
Rachel, you've got to keep it down.

32:26.833 --> 32:28.876
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

32:28.878 --> 32:32.258
You're freaking her out!
Look, I'm driving! Do something!

32:33.131 --> 32:34.331
Ok, put them up, Rach.

32:34.624 --> 32:35.516
Make the arms.

32:35.634 --> 32:37.292
This space right here, this is yours.

32:37.293 --> 32:38.469
This belongs to you, right?

32:38.553 --> 32:40.094
Yes.
You're safe in your space.

32:40.274 --> 32:41.556
I'm safe in my space.
You're safe in your space.

32:41.558 --> 32:43.133
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

32:43.308 --> 32:44.350
I'm really scared.
Ok.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.079
I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

32:46.081 --> 32:47.721
No.
I'll be two feet away. Ok?

32:48.112 --> 32:49.360
Will you hold my hand?
Yes.

32:49.362 --> 32:50.375
Will you hold my hand?
Yes.

32:50.377 --> 32:51.424
Are you gonna be ok?
Yes.

32:54.027 --> 32:55.481
I wanna know everything you know.

32:56.724 --> 32:57.612
This

32:58.490 --> 33:00.495
This thing, this machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

33:00.497 --> 33:02.329
started torching everything.

33:02.330 --> 33:03.521
It was killing everybody.

33:03.870 --> 33:04.861
What is it?

33:05.357 --> 33:06.580
Is it terrorists?

33:06.790 --> 33:08.969
No, this came from some place else.

33:09.668 --> 33:10.661
What do you mean, like Europe?

33:10.662 --> 33:12.498
No, Robbie, not like Europe!

33:23.765 --> 33:25.225
That machine,

33:25.460 --> 33:26.420
it was already...

33:27.201 --> 33:28.105
buried.

33:29.354 --> 33:30.388
Maybe it...

33:31.413 --> 33:32.160
It...

33:32.710 --> 33:34.213
came down in the lightning storm.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.247
They...

33:36.764 --> 33:38.900
came down in the lightning storm.
What do you mean came down?

33:38.903 --> 33:40.425
You just said, it was buried.

33:40.427 --> 33:42.483
No, the machine
I'm talking about was buried,

33:43.137 --> 33:43.710
but...

33:44.012 --> 33:45.578
what came down in the lightning storm,

33:46.019 --> 33:47.172
what operates it,

33:47.709 --> 33:48.819
that's the...

33:49.644 --> 33:50.490
You know.

33:50.709 --> 33:51.877
The what?
That's the...

33:51.988 --> 33:53.926
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

33:54.796 --> 33:55.537
It's the what?

33:55.538 --> 33:57.561
Hey, Rach. How you doing there, girl?

33:57.580 --> 33:58.834
How is she doing?
How you doing?

33:58.967 --> 34:00.024
Fine.
She's good.

34:00.026 --> 34:00.927
Yeah? Good.

34:00.928 --> 34:02.528
What was that thing you did with her?

34:02.637 --> 34:04.890
Works sometimes. She gets
claustrophobic. Hey, Rachel?

34:05.208 --> 34:06.150
Hey.
I want Mom.

34:06.151 --> 34:07.308
Yeah, I know. You feel better?

34:07.392 --> 34:08.366
I want Mom.
Yeah?

34:08.908 --> 34:10.252
Tell me about it, you know?

34:10.596 --> 34:12.206
Listen, what I need you to do is,
Take me to Mom's.

34:12.214 --> 34:14.440
I just need you to hold it together
for me, ok?

34:14.524 --> 34:15.775
I want Mom!

34:15.859 --> 34:17.750
When you start screaming like that,
you know,

34:17.857 --> 34:19.895
I can't really drive. I know that.
Take me to Mom's!

34:19.902 --> 34:21.259
That's where we're going right now.

34:21.406 --> 34:22.853
Rachel Take me to Mom's!

34:22.893 --> 34:24.163
I know!

34:40.091 --> 34:41.458
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

34:49.210 --> 34:50.429
Robbie, get the door.

34:53.105 --> 34:54.387
Mom!

34:54.670 --> 34:55.982
Mom!
Mom!

34:56.608 --> 34:57.858
Mom!

34:59.111 --> 35:00.030
Mom?

35:00.485 --> 35:01.220
Tim?

35:04.287 --> 35:05.117
Mom?

35:05.595 --> 35:06.259
Tim?

35:10.080 --> 35:10.934
Mom?

35:10.935 --> 35:11.789
Mom?

35:11.873 --> 35:12.765
Tim?

35:13.125 --> 35:14.134
Tim?

35:16.253 --> 35:17.167
Tim?

35:18.797 --> 35:19.691
Mom?

35:22.092 --> 35:23.163
They're gone.

35:23.718 --> 35:24.707
Is she dead?

35:25.929 --> 35:27.583
She's not dead. All right?

35:27.930 --> 35:29.386
She's just not here, ok?

35:29.599 --> 35:30.693
They were never here.

35:30.694 --> 35:31.663
How do you know?

35:32.060 --> 35:33.558
Because they're on their way to Boston.

35:34.396 --> 35:35.700
And so they just...

35:36.473 --> 35:37.610
kept on going up to Boston.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.315
They're probably
at your grandma's house by now.

35:39.317 --> 35:40.324
I'm gonna call her.

35:40.652 --> 35:42.747
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

35:43.613 --> 35:44.361
Because...

35:45.121 --> 35:46.637
nothing bad happened here. Ok?

35:46.740 --> 35:48.356
So we're safe here. All right?

35:49.077 --> 35:50.958
Ok, Rachel? This is, this is your area.

35:51.828 --> 35:53.508
Ok, you are safe...
Dad, that's not how it goes.

35:54.791 --> 35:56.023
Ok. Well, are you hungry?

35:56.024 --> 35:57.461
I'll get you some food.

35:57.669 --> 35:58.618
I'm gonna feed you.

35:59.026 --> 36:00.100
Get something to eat.

36:00.922 --> 36:02.173
What do we have? We have...
Busy signal,

36:02.175 --> 36:03.526
What is this? Ketchup, mustard.
One of the fast ones.

36:04.176 --> 36:05.461
You think all the circuits are down?
Tabasco,

36:06.244 --> 36:07.450
barbecue sauce.

36:07.465 --> 36:08.792
You know, this is really good, Robbie.

36:08.793 --> 36:10.175
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

36:10.182 --> 36:11.466
What the hell is this?

36:11.673 --> 36:13.127
That's all that was in your kitchen.

36:13.351 --> 36:13.994
Ok.

36:14.748 --> 36:16.056
That's all right.

36:17.394 --> 36:18.551
All right. Ok.

36:22.449 --> 36:23.113
Food.

36:23.703 --> 36:24.562
Bread.

36:25.697 --> 36:27.609
Ok. We're gonna have...

36:29.409 --> 36:30.613
Let's get some sandwiches.

36:33.914 --> 36:35.089
Wanna see me deal?

36:36.208 --> 36:37.868
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

36:38.126 --> 36:40.753
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

36:40.837 --> 36:42.922
There's two for me, one for the house.

36:46.218 --> 36:46.926
Ok.

36:47.624 --> 36:49.870
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

36:50.639 --> 36:51.937
Teach you how to play some poker?

36:52.287 --> 36:53.474
A little five-card stud?

36:53.558 --> 36:55.667
Maybe a little blackjack.
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

36:57.479 --> 36:58.335
Since when?

36:59.272 --> 37:00.102
Birth.

37:04.277 --> 37:05.652
Ok, well, here.

37:06.112 --> 37:07.412
You can eat the bread. Ok?

37:08.240 --> 37:09.433
I'm not hungry.

37:11.243 --> 37:12.001
Ok, well,

37:13.078 --> 37:14.925
Robbie and I are gonna be eating
peanut butter sandwiches.

37:15.497 --> 37:16.640
Want jelly on this sandwich?

37:16.641 --> 37:17.817
I'm not hungry either.

37:18.526 --> 37:19.704
You're not hungry either?

37:20.650 --> 37:21.340
Ok.

37:22.045 --> 37:24.338
Ok, that's fine.

37:33.223 --> 37:35.173
Everybody just relax, ok?

37:35.517 --> 37:36.804
Because we're here now.

37:36.805 --> 37:38.500
We're safe, we're gonna stay and...

37:39.104 --> 37:41.313
in the morning, your mom
and Tim are gonna be here.

37:41.398 --> 37:43.023
And everything's gonna be fine.

37:43.108 --> 37:43.826
Ok?

37:46.027 --> 37:46.865
Ok.

37:51.449 --> 37:54.001
If everything's fine, why do we have
to sleep in the basement?

37:54.117 --> 37:55.345
We've got perfectly good beds.

37:55.397 --> 37:57.281
Hey, it's like a slumber party.

37:57.455 --> 37:58.956
What are you afraid
is gonna happen to us?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.209
Nice basement.

38:00.709 --> 38:01.936
I wanna sleep in my bed.

38:02.546 --> 38:03.810
I've got back problems.

38:05.714 --> 38:06.907
Ok. Well...

38:07.424 --> 38:09.445
You know on the weather channel
when there is a tornado and they...

38:10.273 --> 38:11.861
tell you to go down to
the basement for safety?

38:12.156 --> 38:12.842
It's like that.

38:12.929 --> 38:14.096
There's gonna be tornadoes?

38:14.097 --> 38:15.364
Ok, Rachel.
Hey,

38:16.125 --> 38:17.326
no more talking, ok?

38:17.328 --> 38:19.084
No more talking.
Could you be a little nicer to me?

38:19.728 --> 38:20.464
God.

38:25.900 --> 38:26.984
Wanna stay here?
Yeah.

38:27.068 --> 38:28.652
Good.
Good night. Love you.

38:28.737 --> 38:29.749
Love you, Rach.

39:44.938 --> 39:46.238
Is the lightning back?

39:48.233 --> 39:50.110
No, this is something else.

40:10.088 --> 40:12.503
What's that sound?
I've never heard that before!

40:12.757 --> 40:14.174
Is it them? Is it them?

40:16.219 --> 40:17.255
We got to go.

40:17.512 --> 40:19.388
Where do we go?
Robbie, this is your house.

40:19.472 --> 40:20.588
Where do we go?

40:32.068 --> 40:33.694
No, no, no, wait!

40:52.714 --> 40:54.284
Are we still alive?

42:47.871 --> 42:49.115
Down here.

42:53.877 --> 42:55.328
Were you on this plane?

42:57.046 --> 42:58.858
Are you Are you a passenger?

43:06.222 --> 43:07.109
How you doing?

43:07.391 --> 43:08.614
Wanna help me open this?

43:11.644 --> 43:12.823
Are you a passenger?

43:13.605 --> 43:14.593
He's deaf.

43:15.460 --> 43:16.954
The shell went off right beside him.

43:16.955 --> 43:19.192
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

43:19.326 --> 43:20.592
You hear that, Max?

43:20.913 --> 43:23.257
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

43:24.282 --> 43:25.286
Where were you?

43:26.618 --> 43:28.002
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

43:29.412 --> 43:31.262
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

43:31.456 --> 43:32.824
The 83rd Mechanized.

43:33.124 --> 43:34.981
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

43:35.501 --> 43:37.210
They've got some kind of shield
around them.

43:37.295 --> 43:40.212
You can't see it, but everything
we fire at them detonates too early,

43:40.214 --> 43:42.310
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

43:43.732 --> 43:46.900
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

43:47.931 --> 43:49.337
There's more than one?

43:51.225 --> 43:52.549
You got to be kidding me, right?

43:54.397 --> 43:55.503
We were feeding New York,

43:55.504 --> 43:56.563
but New York went dark.

43:56.749 --> 43:58.870
So we patched over to DC,
they went down.

43:59.192 --> 44:02.027
LA, Chicago, uplinked to London.

44:02.111 --> 44:05.006
Even called the affiliates
to try to get them to catch the feed,

44:05.448 --> 44:06.616
but nobody answers.

44:06.700 --> 44:08.052
It's the same everywhere.

44:08.368 --> 44:10.118
Once the Tripods start to move,

44:10.119 --> 44:11.815
no more news comes out of that area.

44:23.341 --> 44:24.590
My God.

44:26.177 --> 44:27.486
You ain't seen nothing yet.

44:30.974 --> 44:31.971
I saw that storm.

44:31.972 --> 44:33.941
I was right in the middle
of one of those.

44:34.352 --> 44:36.061
Well, you didn't see it like this.

44:36.145 --> 44:38.605
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

44:38.722 --> 44:41.198
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

44:41.776 --> 44:43.746
So who's driving the goddamn things?

44:44.321 --> 44:45.455
Watch the lightning.

44:46.072 --> 44:47.781
Watch it.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.403
Watch the lightning.

44:50.743 --> 44:52.208
Keep watching the lightning.

44:56.708 --> 44:57.916
What is that?

44:58.876 --> 44:59.668
That...

45:00.309 --> 45:01.324
is them.

45:02.181 --> 45:03.284
They come down in capsules,

45:03.286 --> 45:04.717
riding the lightning into the ground,

45:04.718 --> 45:06.051
into the machines, right?

45:09.137 --> 45:10.091
You hear that?

45:11.222 --> 45:12.561
We're getting the hell out of here.

45:17.061 --> 45:18.586
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

45:20.398 --> 45:22.745
Hey, were you on that plane?

45:25.528 --> 45:26.596
That's too bad.

45:26.938 --> 45:28.864
It would have been a really great story.

45:30.575 --> 45:32.336
Look at me. Look at me.

45:32.893 --> 45:34.726
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

45:35.246 --> 45:36.814
Ok.
Don't look down. Don't look around me.

45:37.915 --> 45:40.392
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna want to look around.

45:41.127 --> 45:42.353
But you're not going to.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.291
Are you?
No.

45:44.756 --> 45:45.865
You're doing good.

45:46.155 --> 45:48.001
You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

45:48.342 --> 45:49.499
I'm going right to Boston.

45:49.719 --> 45:51.327
We're gonna see your mom.
I'm not gonna look, Dad.

45:52.138 --> 45:53.097
That's a girl.

45:53.371 --> 45:55.728
That's my girl. Now listen.
I want you to close your eyes, ok?

45:55.729 --> 45:56.141
Ok.

45:56.225 --> 45:56.915
Got them closed?

45:57.432 --> 45:58.464
There you go.

45:58.770 --> 46:01.104
Keep them closed for me.
Ok.

46:06.402 --> 46:07.472
Robbie, get in.

46:09.655 --> 46:11.620
Robbie, get in!
Why are you yelling?

46:11.672 --> 46:12.645
It's ok.

46:15.620 --> 46:16.535
Get in.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.111
Why the hell aren't
we on the turnpike?

46:39.112 --> 46:41.645
Because I don't want everybody
to see that we've got a working car.

46:41.729 --> 46:43.349
We'll stay along the Hudson till...

46:43.552 --> 46:46.074
we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

46:46.387 --> 46:47.499
We'll take the back roads,

46:47.817 --> 46:50.028
across Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

46:50.571 --> 46:51.613
Where is everybody?

46:52.080 --> 46:53.535
I don't know, running, hiding.

46:53.621 --> 46:56.064
Hiding in their basements.
If we had any balls, we'd go back there

46:56.072 --> 46:57.797
and find one of those things and kill it.

46:58.047 --> 46:59.538
Right. Yeah, good.

46:59.622 --> 47:01.706
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions, ok?

47:01.791 --> 47:03.460
Which would be when, never? Ray?

47:03.462 --> 47:04.279
Never's about your speed.

47:04.281 --> 47:04.945
Stop it, Robbie.
Ok. Hey?

47:05.002 --> 47:07.045
Enough of the Ray shit. All right?

47:07.130 --> 47:08.547
It's Dad, sir, Don't fight!

47:08.568 --> 47:10.569
Or if you want, Mr. Ferrier.

47:10.842 --> 47:13.075
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

47:14.679 --> 47:15.518
Dad?

47:16.019 --> 47:17.022
Yes, Rachel.

47:19.809 --> 47:21.226
I've got to go to the bathroom.

47:22.937 --> 47:23.842
Really?

47:31.028 --> 47:33.363
I got to go.
Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

47:33.407 --> 47:35.015
There's two things we got
to watch out for.

47:35.491 --> 47:36.535
And the second,

47:36.536 --> 47:38.076
is people who might want our car.

47:38.161 --> 47:40.127
There's nobody around.
Yeah. I got to go.

47:48.588 --> 47:51.423
All right. Rachel?
Rachel, it's good right there.

47:51.507 --> 47:53.458
I'm not going in front of you guys.

47:53.885 --> 47:56.094
All right,
then just go where I can see you.

47:56.387 --> 47:57.705
Are you crazy?

47:57.972 --> 47:59.973
Don't look!
Well, I'm not gonna look.

48:00.057 --> 48:01.506
Just stay in sight!

48:01.507 --> 48:02.893
That's looking!

48:04.312 --> 48:06.556
Ok, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

48:07.273 --> 48:09.867
I'm telling your mother, ok?
I'm making a list.

48:12.069 --> 48:13.142
Making a list.

48:56.072 --> 48:58.458
I told you to stay where I could see you.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

49:14.298 --> 49:15.631
Stop! Don't go!

49:15.967 --> 49:18.105
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

49:18.302 --> 49:19.955
Let me on! Give me a hand!

49:20.721 --> 49:22.225
Wait! Stop!

49:22.431 --> 49:23.080
Stop!

49:23.081 --> 49:24.426
Give me a hand!
Hey, watch it, kid,

49:24.428 --> 49:26.185
you're gonna get yourself run over!
Give me a hand!

49:26.229 --> 49:28.195
You have room! You have room!
Robbie!

49:28.479 --> 49:30.132
Robbie, you wanna go in that direction?

49:30.133 --> 49:31.481
Stop! Stop! Wait!

49:31.565 --> 49:34.359
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

49:34.443 --> 49:36.820
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

49:36.904 --> 49:39.040
You never gave a shit!
Ok, hard-ass.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.603
What's your plan?
You're in charge now!

49:41.617 --> 49:42.745
You tell me what we're doing.

49:42.747 --> 49:44.090
We catch up with these soldiers!
What do we do?

49:44.091 --> 49:45.578
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,

49:45.663 --> 49:47.122
and we get back at them.

49:47.206 --> 49:49.157
We get, we get back at them.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.830
That's what we do.

49:50.833 --> 49:54.816
Now let's try one that doesn't involve
your 10-year-old sister joining the Army.

49:55.172 --> 49:56.639
You have anything like that?

49:56.640 --> 49:58.813
Why don't you just tell us the truth?
Wanna try something like that?

49:58.814 --> 50:00.264
You have no idea which way to go.
You have anything like that?

50:00.266 --> 50:02.191
You wanna come
off all wise and shit!

50:02.388 --> 50:05.098
You only chose Boston
because you hoped Mom was there.

50:05.182 --> 50:07.600
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

50:07.685 --> 50:09.102
You can dump us on her,

50:09.207 --> 50:11.231
and then you'll only have
to care about yourself,

50:11.439 --> 50:14.220
which is exactly the way you like it.

50:15.985 --> 50:17.021
Robbie!

50:17.550 --> 50:19.322
Where are you trying to go?

50:19.864 --> 50:21.534
What are you trying to do?

50:23.284 --> 50:25.491
Who's gonna take care of me if you go?

50:44.388 --> 50:46.921
<i>This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.</i>

50:47.725 --> 50:50.435
<i>If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages</i>

50:50.519 --> 50:53.986
<i>from federal, state or local authorities
would have followed the alert tone.</i>

50:54.736 --> 50:57.394
<i>This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert</i>

50:59.313 --> 51:01.243
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit?

51:02.990 --> 51:04.443
I don't have a license.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.684
Since when has that stopped you?

51:39.151 --> 51:40.079
Ray.

51:42.905 --> 51:43.668
Ray!

51:44.082 --> 51:45.037
Dad!

51:48.869 --> 51:49.986
You think you could...

51:50.496 --> 51:52.211
You think you could,
do you think you could...

51:53.958 --> 51:54.908
Don't stop.

51:55.543 --> 51:57.383
Don't take your foot off. Ok?

51:57.795 --> 52:00.303
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Ok, I got it. I got it.

52:00.965 --> 52:03.050
Where is everybody going?
I don't know, Rach.

52:03.926 --> 52:05.187
But we do, right?

52:06.137 --> 52:07.046
Yeah, we do.

52:19.817 --> 52:20.785
Why did he do that?

52:23.716 --> 52:25.800
Why is he doing that?
He wants a ride, Rach.

52:25.823 --> 52:27.963
Everybody just wants a ride.
Can we give him one?

52:29.160 --> 52:31.861
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

52:32.801 --> 52:34.480
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

52:38.002 --> 52:39.659
Be careful.
How'd you fix this?

52:40.087 --> 52:41.984
How'd you fix the car?
Please!

52:45.509 --> 52:47.427
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

52:47.429 --> 52:49.009
Please, get away from the car.

52:49.355 --> 52:51.230
Hey! Stop the car.

52:51.244 --> 52:53.584
Hey! Stop the car!
Get off the car!

52:53.730 --> 52:54.706
Get off the car!

52:55.060 --> 52:57.189
You could carry 20 people in there!

52:57.314 --> 52:59.772
Stop the car!
Get off the car!

52:59.857 --> 53:01.253
Stop the car!

53:05.355 --> 53:06.308
Hold on.

53:07.198 --> 53:08.781
Wait, wait.
Look out. Look out.

53:08.866 --> 53:10.211
Look out! Hold on!

53:19.233 --> 53:20.167
Are you ok?

53:31.805 --> 53:32.836
Ray!
Robbie!

53:34.016 --> 53:35.379
No, wait! Wait!

53:35.643 --> 53:38.645
No! No, just wait! Ok! Wait! Stop!

53:38.729 --> 53:40.730
Just stop!
Daddy!

53:40.814 --> 53:42.357
Rachel!

53:42.983 --> 53:44.734
Get out of there!

53:46.070 --> 53:47.460
Robbie!

53:55.079 --> 53:56.466
Daddy!

53:57.289 --> 53:59.342
Ray!
Get in the car!

54:04.755 --> 54:07.393
Help!
Rachel! Get out of the car!

54:07.633 --> 54:08.638
Rachel, get...

54:08.639 --> 54:09.759
Get out of the car.

54:09.843 --> 54:11.474
Get out!
Daddy!

54:19.728 --> 54:21.854
Take it easy!
Get off the car! Get off the car!

54:21.939 --> 54:22.799
Get off!

54:23.384 --> 54:24.924
Get off the car. Move!

54:25.143 --> 54:25.900
Move!

54:27.111 --> 54:28.111
Where's my son?

54:28.278 --> 54:29.278
You don't need that, man.
Put the gun down.

54:29.280 --> 54:30.539
Where's my son?
Cool down, man.

54:30.541 --> 54:31.438
Robbie!

54:31.992 --> 54:33.284
Put the gun down, man.
Robbie!

54:33.286 --> 54:34.173
Put it down.

54:39.832 --> 54:41.125
Dad!

54:43.294 --> 54:45.044
Ok, man, now, listen.

54:45.212 --> 54:46.930
Put down the gun.
I'm taking the car.

54:46.931 --> 54:48.256
My daughter's in the car.

54:48.340 --> 54:49.896
Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
Please.

54:49.898 --> 54:51.908
All I want...
Put down the goddamn gun!

54:51.909 --> 54:53.219
All I want is my daughter.

54:53.304 --> 54:55.324
I'm taking the car, man.
Please, I just want my daughter.

54:55.931 --> 54:56.784
Please, let me...

54:56.785 --> 54:57.890
Let me just take my daughter.
Can I...

54:57.975 --> 54:58.987
All I want is my daughter.

54:58.989 --> 55:00.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go ahead, man. Take her.

55:00.703 --> 55:01.226
Yeah. Yeah.

55:01.979 --> 55:02.779
Robbie.

55:13.032 --> 55:14.235
Take me with you.

56:32.236 --> 56:34.023
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

56:34.238 --> 56:37.323
The US, mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

56:37.408 --> 56:38.911
There's nothing going on in Europe.

56:39.201 --> 56:41.543
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

56:41.995 --> 56:44.662
Completely wiped out some of it.
I don't give a shit who it is.

56:44.664 --> 56:46.951
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

56:47.131 --> 56:48.756
If they're all over the place, we're dead.

56:49.086 --> 56:50.999
Looks like the power's still on here.
Yeah.

56:52.047 --> 56:53.391
Yeah, power's still on.

56:54.258 --> 56:57.055
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

56:57.261 --> 57:00.188
Hold on. Hold on, move back.
Watch out there, lady.

57:01.098 --> 57:02.510
I said, move back.

57:39.553 --> 57:43.848
<i>Unless you are O-positive
and Rh-negative, thank you very much,</i>

57:43.932 --> 57:46.195
<i>but we already have
more blood than we can use.</i>

57:47.019 --> 57:47.806
<i>Again,</i>

57:47.969 --> 57:50.133
<i>if you are O-positive,</i>

57:50.606 --> 57:52.530
<i>Rh-negative, identify yourselves.</i>

57:54.234 --> 57:56.121
<i>If you are not, thank you very much.</i>

57:56.445 --> 57:58.928
<i>We already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.</i>

57:59.573 --> 58:00.807
Let's go, folks.

58:01.742 --> 58:02.737
This way. This way.

58:03.104 --> 58:04.165
Keep it moving.

58:04.745 --> 58:05.599
Keep it moving.

58:06.013 --> 58:06.878
This way.

58:07.300 --> 58:08.816
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

58:09.041 --> 58:10.591
Please move forward calmly.

58:10.592 --> 58:12.965
The boat can make more than one trip.

58:13.378 --> 58:15.171
Please move forward calmly.

58:15.475 --> 58:17.484
Take your time. Don't rush.

58:17.758 --> 58:20.051
Ray! Ray! Ray!

58:20.135 --> 58:21.503
Sheryl?
Yeah.

58:21.504 --> 58:22.199
Hey.

58:22.679 --> 58:24.388
Oh, my gosh, is this your...

58:24.473 --> 58:25.807
Are these your kids?
This is Rachel.

58:25.891 --> 58:28.601
Hi, I'm Sheryl. How are you?
This is my daughter, Nora.

58:28.685 --> 58:31.103
Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
Hi.

58:31.188 --> 58:33.402
This is my son, Robbie.
Just like Dad.

58:48.997 --> 58:51.043
It's good to see you as well.
Trees are funny.

58:52.251 --> 58:55.329
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

58:57.798 --> 58:59.370
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

58:59.883 --> 59:02.961
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

59:03.428 --> 59:06.389
We got sick people here. Let us on.
Let us on, for Christ's sake.

59:41.460 --> 59:43.808
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

59:44.219 --> 59:45.533
Cast off now.

59:45.835 --> 59:47.256
Get that ramp up.

59:47.431 --> 59:48.456
Cast off.

59:48.765 --> 59:50.636
No more people. No more people.

59:50.637 --> 59:51.726
We're taking the ramp up.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.244
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Back up. Back up.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.387
There's room.
Just stay back.

01:00:28.435 --> 01:00:30.154
There's no more room.
There's no more room.

01:00:30.179 --> 01:00:31.763
Just listen to me. There's three of us.

01:00:31.808 --> 01:00:34.376
Five. There's only five of us.
There's no more room.

01:00:34.529 --> 01:00:36.131
Ok, man, just don't push me.

01:00:36.146 --> 01:00:38.397
Sir, there is no more room.
There is plenty of room.

01:00:38.482 --> 01:00:40.477
There's room for hundreds more.
Sir

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:42.087
Everybody, wait.
Hold on.

01:00:42.089 --> 01:00:43.465
You just stay with me.
Ok.

01:00:43.695 --> 01:00:44.802
Grab my jacket.

01:00:44.995 --> 01:00:46.308
Everybody, back up.

01:00:46.782 --> 01:00:47.816
Back up.

01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:49.211
I got you, Ferrier.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.410
Oh, Jesus.
You ok?

01:00:51.495 --> 01:00:52.536
Yeah.
Come on. Come.

01:00:52.621 --> 01:00:54.592
Ok. Jesus. Oh, my God.
Come on. Come on.

01:00:55.499 --> 01:00:57.166
Watch out.

01:01:04.424 --> 01:01:05.259
Come on.

01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:08.469
Move. Move. Move.
Ray.

01:01:08.553 --> 01:01:09.594
Ray!

01:01:11.431 --> 01:01:13.683
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Move it! Get out of here!

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.677
Go. I can go with him.

01:01:17.325 --> 01:01:18.169
Sheryl?

01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:21.232
Stay back.
Go with them. Go.

01:01:21.316 --> 01:01:22.400
Ray.
Sheryl?

01:01:22.484 --> 01:01:24.235
Everybody Sheryl?

01:01:24.319 --> 01:01:27.113
There's room on the boat.
Let us through, God damn it.

01:01:27.197 --> 01:01:29.281
There's still room on the boat.
She's a child.

01:01:29.366 --> 01:01:31.075
Robbie.
There's room on the

01:01:31.159 --> 01:01:33.369
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

01:01:33.371 --> 01:01:34.413
Up there!

01:01:39.543 --> 01:01:41.044
Robbie.
Just stay with me.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.854
Stay with me, Robbie.

01:01:46.987 --> 01:01:47.976
Robbie!

01:02:13.493 --> 01:02:14.760
Robbie! Robbie!

01:02:15.138 --> 01:02:15.818
Robbie!

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:17.166
Robbie!

01:02:21.752 --> 01:02:24.003
Robbie.
Come on.

01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:26.019
Here. Grab my hand.

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.933
Here. Hold on.

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:29.748
I got you. Hold on.

01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:32.225
Take my hand.

01:02:32.846 --> 01:02:34.564
Take it. Take my hand.

01:02:35.098 --> 01:02:36.031
Here!

01:02:56.953 --> 01:02:58.395
Oh, my God.

01:03:18.308 --> 01:03:19.308
Robbie!

01:04:03.645 --> 01:04:05.604
Swim. Swim this way.

01:04:12.696 --> 01:04:14.728
Robbie!
Robbie!

01:04:59.075 --> 01:04:59.876
Help me.

01:05:00.134 --> 01:05:01.088
Help me with her.

01:05:01.573 --> 01:05:02.534
Here, Rach.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.463
Don't stop. Don't stop.

01:05:07.847 --> 01:05:08.781
Don't stop.

01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:27.798
Oh, my God.

01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:32.710
Robbie, slow down.

01:06:43.364 --> 01:06:44.717
Robbie, slow down!

01:06:58.945 --> 01:07:00.788
Robbie.
We got to stay together, Robbie.

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:04.774
Robbie?

01:07:05.577 --> 01:07:06.604
Stay together.

01:07:07.162 --> 01:07:08.186
Robbie!

01:07:12.083 --> 01:07:13.277
Get back here!

01:07:18.757 --> 01:07:19.781
Robbie!

01:07:20.425 --> 01:07:21.392
No, Robbie!

01:07:22.442 --> 01:07:23.426
Come back!

01:07:31.394 --> 01:07:32.285
Robbie.

01:07:33.104 --> 01:07:34.730
Don't move. Don't move.

01:07:35.148 --> 01:07:37.918
For God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

01:07:38.151 --> 01:07:39.985
Robbie!
Stop those people.

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:41.737
Turn around. Turn around.
Robbie.

01:07:43.198 --> 01:07:44.018
Robbie.

01:07:46.159 --> 01:07:47.284
What the hell?

01:07:47.369 --> 01:07:48.599
Why are you doing this?

01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:56.165
Pull back.
Five hundred meters to my 10 o'clock.

01:07:58.338 --> 01:08:00.499
Jekyll, no effect on target. No effect.

01:08:00.631 --> 01:08:01.939
Roger. No effect.

01:08:02.092 --> 01:08:04.802
Our mission, Lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

01:08:04.886 --> 01:08:06.756
till those refugees
get to safety.

01:08:06.757 --> 01:08:07.895
Now, keep firing.

01:08:09.933 --> 01:08:11.296
You've got to listen. Turn around!

01:08:11.466 --> 01:08:12.810
I want you to listen to me.

01:08:15.772 --> 01:08:16.825
Listen to me.

01:08:17.107 --> 01:08:18.564
Go back down the hill.

01:08:18.649 --> 01:08:20.478
All of you, just turn around.

01:08:33.122 --> 01:08:35.541
Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
I wanna be here.

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:37.459
I need to see this.
I know it seems like you have to,

01:08:37.544 --> 01:08:39.550
but you don't. You don't.
Please, let me go.

01:08:40.712 --> 01:08:42.218
Ok. Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:43.216 --> 01:08:45.072
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

01:08:45.301 --> 01:08:46.801
Look, sweetie,
you got to come with us, please.

01:08:46.886 --> 01:08:48.886
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:50.180
You can't stay here.
We got to go.

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:51.890
I'm not gonna leave her alone.
Leave.

01:08:51.975 --> 01:08:53.988
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

01:08:54.394 --> 01:08:56.270
You can hate me. But I love you.
Let me go. Please.

01:08:56.354 --> 01:08:57.926
Let me go. Dad.
I'm not letting you do this.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:59.520
I can't. No. Please.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.816
Please don't pull me.

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:03.514
It's gonna be ok. You need
to come with us. It is not safe

01:09:03.569 --> 01:09:05.694
Please, let me stay here. Please.
I can't go with you.

01:09:05.697 --> 01:09:07.238
My dad's right there.
Please, come.

01:09:07.323 --> 01:09:09.241
Please, my dad's right there.
Will you just listen to me?

01:09:09.325 --> 01:09:11.675
I need to be here. I want to see this.

01:09:12.203 --> 01:09:14.705
Wait. Wait. Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

01:09:14.788 --> 01:09:17.194
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:23.005
All right. Ok. All right.
You're coming with us.

01:09:23.089 --> 01:09:24.256
We got to go! Now!
Dad.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.258
We're going now.
No, no, you don't understand.

01:09:26.341 --> 01:09:27.205
Dad!

01:09:41.357 --> 01:09:42.783
Let me go! Dad!

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:43.782
Dad!

01:09:46.196 --> 01:09:49.740
Guide on. Guide on. Black Six.
Attack. Attack. Attack.

01:09:51.993 --> 01:09:52.950
Stop.

01:09:53.786 --> 01:09:55.346
That's my dad.
I'm her father.

01:09:55.347 --> 01:09:56.555
I'm her father.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.790
We're so sorry.
We thought she was alone.

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.710
She was standing by the tree
She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

01:10:05.975 --> 01:10:06.745
Robbie.

01:10:17.393 --> 01:10:18.441
Robbie!

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:38.881
Over here.

01:10:39.457 --> 01:10:40.916
Over here!

01:10:44.436 --> 01:10:45.345
Hurry.

01:11:05.858 --> 01:11:06.946
Are you all right?

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:08.498
Hey.

01:11:11.489 --> 01:11:12.567
What about you?

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:27.970
There you go.

01:11:30.508 --> 01:11:31.800
Is that comfortable?

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.107
I need you to close your eyes
now, ok?

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.401
You need some sleep.

01:11:41.289 --> 01:11:42.096
Dad?

01:11:42.937 --> 01:11:43.900
He's gonna meet us.

01:11:45.857 --> 01:11:47.804
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

01:11:48.151 --> 01:11:50.155
In Boston, at your grandma's.

01:11:50.695 --> 01:11:52.933
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

01:11:53.948 --> 01:11:54.862
Mom?

01:11:56.784 --> 01:11:58.539
Boston. She's waiting.

01:11:59.287 --> 01:12:02.213
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

01:12:02.874 --> 01:12:05.234
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,
and she's...

01:12:08.004 --> 01:12:10.153
She's making that awful tea, she makes.

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:12.258
And they're all just...

01:12:13.635 --> 01:12:15.883
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

01:12:19.067 --> 01:12:19.989
What is this?

01:12:20.473 --> 01:12:21.421
What is this?

01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:23.572
I won.

01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:24.921
You won?

01:12:25.521 --> 01:12:27.083
The walk, trot and canter.

01:12:27.982 --> 01:12:29.047
Third place.

01:12:38.201 --> 01:12:40.032
Sing me Lullaby and Goodnight.

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:46.311
I don't know that one.

01:12:48.044 --> 01:12:49.425
Sing me Hushabye Mountain.

01:12:53.675 --> 01:12:54.638
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...

01:12:54.639 --> 01:12:56.284
I don't know that one either.

01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:21.193

Peach schnapps.

01:13:58.531 --> 01:13:59.868
Disgusting, I know it.

01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:01.444
Found a whole case of this shit.

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:10.314
Thank you.

01:14:16.132 --> 01:14:17.579
I'm sorry about your son.

01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:19.601
We got separated. He's...

01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:21.052
He's gonna meet us...

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.299
in Boston.

01:14:29.979 --> 01:14:30.834
Did you...

01:14:33.399 --> 01:14:34.751
Did you lose anybody?

01:14:37.653 --> 01:14:38.676
All of them.

01:14:42.283 --> 01:14:43.855
Harlan Ogilvy.

01:14:45.787 --> 01:14:46.802
Ray Ferrier.

01:14:47.246 --> 01:14:48.343
I got water.

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.353
Food enough for weeks.

01:14:53.336 --> 01:14:54.998
You're welcome to stay. Both of you.

01:14:56.255 --> 01:14:57.147
I'm sorry.

01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:00.352
I'm gonna get some sleep.

01:15:02.804 --> 01:15:04.176
Those machines, those...

01:15:05.419 --> 01:15:06.773
Tripods they got,

01:15:09.852 --> 01:15:10.791
they buried them.

01:15:12.814 --> 01:15:14.068
Right under our feet.

01:15:16.025 --> 01:15:17.146
Since before there...

01:15:18.402 --> 01:15:19.726
There were even people here.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.276
They've been planning this
for a million years.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.290
We're beat to shit.

01:15:27.738 --> 01:15:28.574
Please.

01:15:29.288 --> 01:15:30.471
My daughter...
Think about it.

01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:37.321
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

01:15:38.256 --> 01:15:39.360
Walked right over us.

01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:42.421
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

01:15:44.983 --> 01:15:46.150
This is not a war,

01:15:46.152 --> 01:15:48.377
any more than there is
a war between men and maggots.

01:15:49.892 --> 01:15:51.456
This is an extermination.

01:16:02.572 --> 01:16:03.687
You afraid?

01:16:06.075 --> 01:16:07.120
Of course I am.

01:16:10.538 --> 01:16:11.833
I been around death plenty.

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.626
I drive an ambulance in the city

01:16:15.835 --> 01:16:18.084
Drove, an ambulance in the city.

01:16:18.451 --> 01:16:19.670
That's all over now?

01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:25.942
You know the people that make it, Ray?

01:16:27.263 --> 01:16:29.626
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

01:16:33.102 --> 01:16:35.172
It's the ones that keep their eyes open.

01:16:36.689 --> 01:16:37.970
That keep looking at you.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.385
Keep thinking.

01:16:40.109 --> 01:16:41.478
They're the ones that survive.

01:16:43.988 --> 01:16:45.526
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

01:16:48.326 --> 01:16:49.126
Running.

01:16:50.328 --> 01:16:51.582
That's what'll kill you.

01:16:53.956 --> 01:16:55.896
And I'm dead set on living.

01:17:02.131 --> 01:17:03.322
Dead set on living

01:17:07.011 --> 01:17:08.424
Thank you for taking us in.

01:17:16.354 --> 01:17:17.705
Not gonna be exterminated.

01:17:34.288 --> 01:17:35.039
It's ok.

01:17:35.435 --> 01:17:37.066
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

01:17:38.834 --> 01:17:39.925
We're gonna fight them, Ray.

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:41.706
They got to have a weakness.

01:17:41.837 --> 01:17:42.917
Come. Take a look.

01:17:51.514 --> 01:17:53.701
Somehow they killed
a few of these things in Osaka.

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:54.849
That's what I heard.

01:17:54.934 --> 01:17:57.395
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:58.871
We can do this, Ray.

01:17:59.355 --> 01:18:01.231
We can do it. We can get them.

01:18:01.315 --> 01:18:02.272
We can figure it out.

01:18:03.693 --> 01:18:04.593
Stay right there.

01:18:24.964 --> 01:18:25.943
I have a daughter.

01:18:26.882 --> 01:18:28.299
Why did you bring us here?

01:18:28.384 --> 01:18:30.017
To fight them together, Ray.

01:18:31.303 --> 01:18:33.843
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

01:18:36.267 --> 01:18:37.476
When the time is right,

01:18:38.436 --> 01:18:40.448
take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

01:18:41.731 --> 01:18:43.030
Take them by surprise.

01:18:45.151 --> 01:18:46.609
We're right under their feet, Ray.

01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:48.479
Right here. Under their feet.

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.187
You miss your mommy?

01:19:40.831 --> 01:19:42.179
I had a little girl.

01:19:43.667 --> 01:19:44.778
Nearly your age.

01:19:46.295 --> 01:19:48.431
You know, if anything
happens to your daddy,

01:19:48.771 --> 01:19:50.188
I'll take care of you.

01:19:50.784 --> 01:19:51.549
Rachel.

01:20:00.309 --> 01:20:01.816
You don't have
anything to say to her.

01:20:02.396 --> 01:20:03.482
Do you understand?

01:20:04.783 --> 01:20:06.169
If you wanna talk to somebody,

01:20:06.554 --> 01:20:08.082
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

01:20:08.324 --> 01:20:10.259
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

01:20:10.986 --> 01:20:12.072
I know what I'm gonna do.

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.167
How about you?

01:20:13.989 --> 01:20:15.010
You gonna sit here?

01:20:15.407 --> 01:20:16.818
Wait for them to come get you?

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:18.537
Is that your plan?

01:20:20.996 --> 01:20:22.275
Maybe you want to get caught.

01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:26.392
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:28.711
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

01:20:33.008 --> 01:20:33.828
Listen.

01:20:35.719 --> 01:20:36.578
It stopped.

01:20:37.085 --> 01:20:38.263
Maybe you'll be ok.

01:20:38.639 --> 01:20:41.141
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and they'll train you as their pet.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.292
You know,

01:20:42.293 --> 01:20:44.644
feed you, train you how to do tricks.

01:20:44.728 --> 01:20:46.089
Will you shut up and listen?

01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:51.297
No.

01:27:15.911 --> 01:27:17.703
Give me that.

01:28:51.214 --> 01:28:52.225
You and me,

01:28:54.217 --> 01:28:56.165
I don't think we're on the same page.

01:29:33.799 --> 01:29:34.499
Ray!

01:29:34.992 --> 01:29:35.749
Ray!

01:29:36.593 --> 01:29:37.218
Ray!

01:29:37.431 --> 01:29:38.770
Ray. Ray!

01:29:39.429 --> 01:29:40.201
Ray!

01:29:41.145 --> 01:29:42.978
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

01:30:25.559 --> 01:30:26.563
Not my blood.

01:30:26.947 --> 01:30:28.010
Not my blood.

01:30:31.231 --> 01:30:32.290
Not my blood.

01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:35.121
Not my!

01:30:36.528 --> 01:30:37.205
Not...

01:30:39.114 --> 01:30:39.952
my.

01:30:44.951 --> 01:30:46.276
Not my blood.

01:30:46.693 --> 01:30:47.924
Not my blood.

01:30:48.465 --> 01:30:49.410
Not my blood.

01:30:50.406 --> 01:30:51.665
Not my blood.

01:30:52.043 --> 01:30:53.370
Not my blood.
Stop it.

01:30:53.544 --> 01:30:54.719
Stop it.
Not my blood.

01:30:54.801 --> 01:30:56.286
Harlan stop it.
Not my blood.

01:30:56.418 --> 01:30:57.844
You got to be quiet.
Not my...

01:30:58.425 --> 01:30:59.676
You want them to hear you?
They drink us.

01:31:00.635 --> 01:31:02.283
Please, they'll hear you.
They drink us.

01:31:02.637 --> 01:31:03.975
Then they spray us,

01:31:03.976 --> 01:31:05.723
Ok.
Like fertilizer.

01:31:05.807 --> 01:31:07.057
You got to be quiet.

01:31:07.142 --> 01:31:08.099
Drink us and...

01:31:08.136 --> 01:31:09.628
They're gonna come
back down here, please.

01:31:10.061 --> 01:31:12.548
Then they spit us out all over
the goddamn red weeds.

01:31:13.315 --> 01:31:14.686
Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do?

01:31:15.129 --> 01:31:17.053
I can't let my daughter die
because of you.

01:31:17.194 --> 01:31:19.060
This tunnel will get us to the city.

01:31:19.446 --> 01:31:21.251
We'll have our own tunnels there.
Ready-made.

01:31:21.253 --> 01:31:22.500
Stop it.
Subway. See what I'm saying?

01:31:22.741 --> 01:31:23.979
We can hide a whole army down there.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:24.981
Stop it.
We'll go underground.

01:31:25.166 --> 01:31:26.088
Stop it.
Sneak attacks at night.

01:31:26.161 --> 01:31:27.027
You stop it!

01:31:29.746 --> 01:31:30.773
We're the resistance, Ray.

01:31:31.214 --> 01:31:32.598
They can't occupy this country.

01:31:33.001 --> 01:31:34.285
Occupations always fail.

01:31:34.544 --> 01:31:36.336
History's taught us that
a thousand times.

01:31:36.797 --> 01:31:37.840
This is our land.

01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:40.960
We eat it, we breathe it,

01:31:40.961 --> 01:31:42.378
only we can live on it.

01:31:42.636 --> 01:31:44.021
They can't survive here, Ray.

01:31:44.193 --> 01:31:45.535
They weren't built for it.

01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:47.988
They're gonna kill you, brother!

01:31:48.125 --> 01:31:49.308
Not me!
What are you doing?

01:31:49.392 --> 01:31:51.310
Not my blood!
What are you doing, Dad?

01:31:51.323 --> 01:31:52.434
Whatever you hear,

01:31:53.556 --> 01:31:54.616
don't take this off.

01:31:54.689 --> 01:31:56.309
Dad?
Rach?

01:31:56.338 --> 01:31:57.006
Dad?

01:31:57.191 --> 01:31:58.379
What was that song?

01:31:58.899 --> 01:32:00.616
That lullaby that I didn't know?

01:32:00.785 --> 01:32:02.132
Not my blood!

01:32:02.697 --> 01:32:04.187
Hushabye Mountain?
Yeah, sing it.

01:32:04.866 --> 01:32:06.888
They can take you!
Please, Rach, sing it.

01:32:07.702 --> 01:32:08.643
They can take you!

We got you.

01:40:15.398 --> 01:40:16.650
Keep pulling!

01:40:24.419 --> 01:40:26.214
Everybody down!

01:41:19.379 --> 01:41:20.952
Keep it moving, folks.

01:41:23.841 --> 01:41:24.782
Keep going, sir.

01:41:24.908 --> 01:41:25.997
Keep moving.

01:41:26.594 --> 01:41:28.900
Oh, God.
I don't know what's going on.

01:41:35.019 --> 01:41:35.967
Let's go, folks.

01:41:36.327 --> 01:41:37.425
Keep moving forward.

01:41:48.574 --> 01:41:49.643
Put that down.

01:41:52.829 --> 01:41:55.197
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way. Thank you.

01:42:03.881 --> 01:42:06.060
To the left, there, ma'am,
just to your left. Thank you.

01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:10.386
What happened to it?

01:42:14.976 --> 01:42:16.125
It's dying.

01:42:19.021 --> 01:42:20.730
Keep moving forward.

01:42:31.451 --> 01:42:32.993
Keep moving. It's all right.

01:42:33.077 --> 01:42:34.661
You can pass on through. Move along.

01:42:34.745 --> 01:42:35.829
What happened here?
I don't know.

01:42:35.913 --> 01:42:37.914
Something's happening to them.
Please, keep moving.

01:42:37.999 --> 01:42:39.541
Let's go, move out.
Let's go, people.

01:42:40.042 --> 01:42:41.269
Something's happening to them.
Go.

01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:43.170
Go, just keep moving, sir.

01:42:43.296 --> 01:42:44.337
Let's go, sir. Let's go.

01:42:44.422 --> 01:42:45.962
Do not stop.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:42:45.965 --> 01:42:47.299
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's happened here?

01:42:47.383 --> 01:42:49.926
Did you guys take it down?
No, sir, it was behaving erratically,

01:42:50.011 --> 01:42:52.721
walking in circles, then it went down
on its own about an hour ago.

01:42:52.805 --> 01:42:54.450
Now, please, let's go.
Let's go. Keep moving.

01:42:54.757 --> 01:42:55.932
Come on. Don't stop.

01:42:56.017 --> 01:42:57.919
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

01:42:59.604 --> 01:43:01.168
How is it dead all by itself?

01:43:01.689 --> 01:43:03.911
Rachel, I'm not sure.
Coming through.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.053
Coming through. Make a hole.
Coming through.

01:43:27.548 --> 01:43:29.142
Calm down.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

01:43:29.509 --> 01:43:31.092
Calm down and get in the tunnel.
Calm down.

01:43:31.177 --> 01:43:32.704
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

01:43:44.899 --> 01:43:47.991
Everybody, calm down.
Get in the tunnel.

01:43:48.152 --> 01:43:50.324
Everybody, on the other side
of the tracks!

01:43:54.575 --> 01:43:55.867
Look at the birds!

01:43:55.952 --> 01:43:57.270
I can't hear you!

01:43:57.578 --> 01:43:59.560
Look at the goddamn birds!

01:44:03.417 --> 01:44:04.943
No shield!
I can't hear!

01:44:05.711 --> 01:44:07.546
No shield!

01:44:11.551 --> 01:44:13.518
The Javelin's the key!

01:44:14.073 --> 01:44:16.867
Load the Gustav!
It's gonna be a tough kill!

01:44:16.973 --> 01:44:18.379
Let's go!

01:44:20.351 --> 01:44:21.518
It's safer in here.

01:44:21.735 --> 01:44:23.562
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:44:23.646 --> 01:44:25.116
Bring out the Javelin!

01:44:34.073 --> 01:44:36.408
Clear! Go from behind! Clear!

01:44:45.459 --> 01:44:47.099
Let me know when you're tracking!

01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:47.953
Tracking!

01:44:48.129 --> 01:44:49.671
You got a lock?
I got a lock!

01:44:49.755 --> 01:44:50.903
Fire the Javelin!

01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:00.102
I got a lock!
Fire the Javelin!

01:45:03.728 --> 01:45:04.462
Fire!

01:45:19.785 --> 01:45:20.666
It's ok.

01:45:22.747 --> 01:45:23.905
I love you.

01:45:24.832 --> 01:45:26.460
It's ok.
Let's go!

01:45:26.485 --> 01:45:27.391
You're gonna be ok.

01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:30.198
Keep those civilians out of there.

01:45:31.172 --> 01:45:32.402
Back. Stay back!

01:45:32.927 --> 01:45:34.654
Come on, folks, back up!

01:45:39.592 --> 01:45:41.303
Come on, guys, get on the line.

01:45:41.304 --> 01:45:42.510
Get up there now.

01:45:43.698 --> 01:45:44.946
Stay back.
Stay right here?

01:45:45.359 --> 01:45:46.418
Hold on right there.

01:45:52.526 --> 01:45:54.565
It's opening.
It's opening. Keep them back.

01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:35.298
Clear!

01:46:36.278 --> 01:46:37.850
No, keep them back.
Keep them back. Come on.

01:46:37.851 --> 01:46:38.834
Stay back.

01:47:15.276 --> 01:47:16.449
Mom!

01:47:21.382 --> 01:47:22.273
Mom.

01:47:44.013 --> 01:47:44.968
