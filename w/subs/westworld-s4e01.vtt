WEBVTT

01:23.208 --> 01:24.209
I don't like it.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.671
His businesses are legitimate.
Why would he need us?

01:37.096 --> 01:38.807
He's been buying
most of the old city

01:38.807 --> 01:42.310
and the outlying areas
using holding companies.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.312
The land is mainly worthless,

01:44.312 --> 01:47.315
but I don't understand
what he's doing.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.435
<i>Encantado.</i>

02:25.770 --> 02:29.482
Likewise.
Have you seen it before?

02:29.566 --> 02:32.861
When I was a kid.
Road trip with my parents.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.113
- Hasn't changed a bit.
- Hmm.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.990
Let me show you around.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.658
Mm-hmm.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.209
We've upgraded
the turbines.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.920
They're rated to last
100 years without maintenance.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.798
All to power... this.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.221
We're looking for resilience.

03:01.514 --> 03:06.769
Our timeline
is more ambitious than most.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.397
We offer a unique proposition.

03:09.397 --> 03:13.568
Data has always been fungible. Temporary.

03:13.568 --> 03:17.322
If you invest yours with us,
it will be written in stone.

03:17.322 --> 03:20.408
- Forever.
- Forever...

03:20.408 --> 03:22.785
...in my experience
is a little bit longer

03:22.869 --> 03:24.287
than most people expect.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.806
How much of our platform
are you looking to reserve?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.225
- All of it.
- Come again?

03:47.226 --> 03:49.562
What I want is already in there.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.273
It was stolen from me.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.610
From one of my facilities,
eight years ago.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.571
And I know you were
paid handsomely to store it.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.951
I would suggest you take it up
with the person who stole it.

04:02.951 --> 04:07.121
I can't. She's dead.
Which means I can't decrypt it.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.499
And no one else can.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.627
I don't want it moved
or disturbed.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.046
So I'll take the whole shebang.

04:15.046 --> 04:20.760
This is a unique asset,
and as such, it's not for sale.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.305
This is America.
Everything here is for sale.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.352
That's a pretty good return
on your investment.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.528
We know
what you've been doing.

04:38.528 --> 04:42.031
You think anyone sells land
without our approval?

04:42.115 --> 04:46.869
We've been happy to sell.
It's worthless scrubland.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.164
But you can't have this place.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.251
You ever hear the one
about the missionary

04:53.251 --> 04:55.044
who tried to negotiate
with the tiger?

04:56.212 --> 04:58.131
He told the tiger
he could eat most of him,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.675
but he had to stop
when he got to his head.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.679
You and your friends
in the cartel

05:04.679 --> 05:07.140
or whatever the fuck you're
calling yourselves these days

05:07.140 --> 05:09.559
sell me this lump
of concrete, today.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.520
Or?

05:12.520 --> 05:15.273
Or you give it to me
for nothing. Tomorrow.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.027
We, uh...

05:20.153 --> 05:22.947
we weren't very welcome
when we came here.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.032
We had to accept

05:24.032 --> 05:26.242
whatever the old timers
offered, at first.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.621
We buried most of them
at the bottom of this lake.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.251
Our organization has
a long, proud history

05:35.251 --> 05:39.422
of defending itself
and its business aggressively.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.468
Door number two, then.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.179
<i>Mañana.</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:04.655
<i>Mañana.</i>

08:02.523 --> 08:05.693
He said that
yesterday he would have paid.

08:07.236 --> 08:12.491
But today we would
give it to him for nothing.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.629
Thank you.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.882
Is my work done?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.511
Yes. You can rest now.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.987
You're up. I have a dilemma.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.908
Which would you choose?
White or black?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.455
Christina?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.040
- They both look great.
- Pick a side, Chrissie.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.671
What are you
wearing tonight?

12:35.671 --> 12:38.090
Uh, this?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.092
Right.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.220
It looks great,

12:43.304 --> 12:46.640
unlike these damn bags
under my eyes.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.684
I look like a zombie.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.687
Bad night's sleep?
Nightmares.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.105
Maybe I should've
taken a tab.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.983
But, uh, I just kept
tossing and turning.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.993
Is it that weirdo again?

13:05.993 --> 13:08.204
I blocked him,
but he keeps getting through.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.413
It's just some creep

13:09.497 --> 13:11.874
or a bot trying to sell you
a privacy subscription.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.375
I guess.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.297
Lately, I feel like
someone's watching me.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.549
No offense, but how?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.760
I mean, except for work,
you don't leave the apartment,

13:22.760 --> 13:26.472
which is why
you're coming out tonight.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.557
I mean, he's supposed to be
a really nice guy.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.226
And his profile's
platinum rated.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.687
Set-ups are just so awkward.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.441
And so is dying alone.

13:37.525 --> 13:41.070
You cannot hide from the world
forever, Christina.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.241
Okay.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.107
MAN 1: That was insane.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.650
This is way better
than I expected.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.069
MAN 2: This place
is fucking wild.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.029
Can't believe
this is your first time.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.239
MAN 2: Come on.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.283
I know a spot that's really
gonna blow your mind.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.793
Can you see it?

14:37.793 --> 14:41.380
It's looming over us. The tower!
Can you see it? Huh?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.717
Can you see it? Can you see it?

15:27.760 --> 15:28.802
Record pitch.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.306
There's a young girl.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.225
Not that young.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.145
More like late teens.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.859
She lives at home
with her father in the country.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.656
Scratch that. The city.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.201
He's a little infirm,

15:52.201 --> 15:54.828
so she spends
most of her time with him.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.081
But she dreams of a bigger life

15:57.081 --> 16:02.002
with excitement,
adventure, romance.

16:02.878 --> 16:03.962
Christina.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.924
Pause record.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.388
We need to talk
about your work performance.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.099
I mean, don't you want
to advance in your career?

16:15.099 --> 16:17.351
- Of course I do.
- Well, then you got to stop

16:17.351 --> 16:19.853
pitching these
saccharine stories.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.315
You know, people want sex,
danger, violence,

16:23.399 --> 16:26.735
transgressions, melodrama.
They want tragedy.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.363
- Yada, yada, yada.
- I know.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.450
I-- I was thinking
maybe I could write

16:33.534 --> 16:36.161
in some different genres
to broaden it out.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.707
Maybe a little romance,
some humor.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.875
Maybe just save that
for your diary.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.086
I know you've got it in you

16:44.086 --> 16:45.963
to write the kind of copy
we need.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.507
Now, take that story you wrote
a couple months back.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.510
Poor schmuck loses everything,
drowns his sorrows,

16:51.510 --> 16:54.179
stalks some girl.
How'd it end again?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.892
- Everyone dies.
- Yes. That's right.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.060
It's a real tearjerker.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.481
Just, uh, bring more of that.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.360
Or else I'm gonna have to
find another writer who can.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.239
- Understood?
- Yes. Of course.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.699
All right.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.014
<i>Hello? You hear me?</i>

17:37.014 --> 17:39.725
<i>I know you're out there.
I saw what you wrote.</i>

17:39.725 --> 17:41.977
<i>- Why are you doing this to us?</i>

17:41.977 --> 17:44.688
<i>You have to help me.
Your game is ruining my life--</i>

17:56.366 --> 17:59.828

17:59.912 --> 18:05.501
♪ ("THE WIND CRIES MARY"
BY JIMI HENDRIX PLAYING) ♪

18:12.090 --> 18:13.675
<i>Always a classic</i>

18:13.759 --> 18:15.052

18:15.052 --> 18:18.514

of the festivities.</i>

18:18.514 --> 18:20.849
<i>Preparations are underway
for this year's...</i>

18:57.469 --> 18:59.388
No!

19:04.476 --> 19:05.811
Are you ready, darling?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.438
For what?
<i>This is the new world.</i>

19:08.522 --> 19:12.818
And in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.779
Oh, for fuck's sake...

20:38.737 --> 20:40.697
Got any plans
for the anniversary?

20:44.034 --> 20:46.244
Nah. Just work.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.206
Cashing in
on that overtime, eh?

20:49.915 --> 20:51.124
Man, seven years ago,

20:51.208 --> 20:54.002
it would've just been robots
working the holiday, but...

20:54.086 --> 20:56.421
lucky for us,
they're all scrap metal now.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.925
Least the riots
ensured our job security.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.095
That wasn't exactly the point
of the riots.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.055
Yeah, 'cause the riots
had no point.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.349
They won us our freedom.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.686
Sure, but from what? Ourselves?

21:10.686 --> 21:12.354
Hey, man, the way I look at it,

21:12.354 --> 21:13.814
that Incite machine
that they blew up

21:13.814 --> 21:17.484
didn't tell us who we could be,
it told us who we already were.

21:17.484 --> 21:21.780
- You actually believe that?
- Don't you? Let me ask you this.

21:22.990 --> 21:23.865
Has your life changed

21:23.949 --> 21:25.450
since they destroyed
those machines?

22:18.086 --> 22:20.964
You haven't been
practicing enough.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.925
Dad!

22:25.177 --> 22:26.219
Good to see you, Cookie.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.889
Here. All right.

22:38.523 --> 22:42.611
- How'd you do that?
- Like I said, practice.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.196
A lot of it.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.698
On cans?

22:48.325 --> 22:50.077
Yeah. On cans.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.620
Here.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.172
M'kay.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.550
Remember. This.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.386
Now stare at it.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.889
Okay. Visualize.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.768
Breathe out.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.186
Hold steady.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.605
And squeeze.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.440
Frankie! Caleb!

23:24.861 --> 23:26.446
I was visualizing.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.074
Well, come inside
and visualize meatloaf.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.162
Just a little longer?
- C'mon, listen to your mother.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.503
Coming.

23:44.923 --> 23:45.924
Go wash up.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.970
Enough with the cowboy shit.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.389
- She likes it.
- She's seven, Caleb.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.433
Thanks to you, her hobbies
are sugar and violence.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.236
Look, I'm sorry.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.281
I know it's not
an easy day for you,

24:09.281 --> 24:12.325
but the war is over.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.120
It's time you start living
that way.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.581
Okay?

24:17.956 --> 24:18.957
Hmm.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.126
Go set the table.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.587
What's the magic word?

24:26.089 --> 24:27.424
Divorce.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.181
- Love you too.
- Hmm.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.174
You lose power
the other night?

25:10.550 --> 25:12.385
Must've been spared.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.845
You, uh,
sure you don't want

25:13.929 --> 25:15.680
some extra bottles
for your guests?

25:16.681 --> 25:17.766
Guests?

25:17.766 --> 25:19.476
Your friends.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.144
Stopped by asking
for directions.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.854
I tried to describe it,

25:22.938 --> 25:26.483
but you live pretty far
off the beaten path.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.735
You really should get
a sat phone or, um,

25:28.735 --> 25:31.238
- some kind of connec--
- These friends of mine,

25:31.238 --> 25:33.365
how long ago did they stop by?

25:33.365 --> 25:35.283
Not 20 minutes
since you been in.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.415
On second thought,

25:42.499 --> 25:44.626
why don't you go ahead
and add that to my tab?

26:37.220 --> 26:38.013
Fire!

27:57.801 --> 27:59.094
How did you find me?

27:59.094 --> 28:02.514
Two days ago. We got a signal.

28:02.514 --> 28:06.309
Your little power outage.
It was enough.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.937
How many more are after me?

28:08.937 --> 28:11.981
I'm no-- not at liberty to say.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.691
Well, let me liberate you.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.985
Seven years,
I've been off the grid alone,

28:16.778 --> 28:18.405
not bothering anyone.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.782
And yet here you are
darkening my door.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.744
Who sent you, Colonel Brigham?

28:24.828 --> 28:26.413
Who the fuck is that?

28:26.413 --> 28:29.207
I'm afraid I don't have
the patience to explain.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.001
Now be a dear.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.212
Close your eyes, won't you?

29:04.659 --> 29:06.244
<i>Go get her.</i>

29:07.871 --> 29:09.330
I've got no idea
she's home or not.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.874
Haven't seen her
in a couple days.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.429
Shit.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.008
<i>Welcome home.</i>

30:57.438 --> 30:59.899
- Hello?
- You on your way?

31:01.150 --> 31:02.610
Shit. I forgot.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.153
<i>You didn't forget.</i>

31:04.237 --> 31:06.072
<i>You repressed.</i>

31:06.072 --> 31:08.324
I'm not going to be
an accessory after the fact

31:08.408 --> 31:10.577
to the murder
of your social life. Let's go.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.953
But--

32:18.478 --> 32:20.480
Look, I'm sure
it was nothing.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.273
Probably that kid
from the fourth floor

32:22.357 --> 32:24.150
that likes to smoke weed
on the fire escape.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.903
Yeah. Right.
- Mm. You want some?

32:26.903 --> 32:28.613
- No, I'm okay.
- Hmm.

32:29.947 --> 32:32.325
Here. In case.

32:32.325 --> 32:35.912
And remember, smile.
You have to at least try.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.039
Do I?

32:38.039 --> 32:41.000
I mean, even if by some miracle
we're right for each other,

32:41.084 --> 32:43.711
shouldn't it be
natural and easy?

32:45.755 --> 32:50.843
Take a look at this world.
Nobody wants easy or natural.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.721
Art is a lie
that tells the truth, honey.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.850
And the truth is, you need
to get laid.

33:03.189 --> 33:07.193
Look at this.
All the people. You like people.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.696
- You should try breathing.
- I should get a drink.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.281
Uh-huh. Yes, you should.
It's going to be great.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.617
Thank you.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.871
Huh. Just give me the signal
if he's a dud.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.707
Hmm?

33:23.126 --> 33:24.961
Oh, and don't forget to smile.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.759
Most people think
it's just elite gambling,

33:31.843 --> 33:34.011
but there's a system
to investing.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.305
Patterns that some minds
can decipher.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.099
If there weren't,
I wouldn't be sitting

33:38.099 --> 33:40.518
in this lovely restaurant
drinking superb wine

33:40.518 --> 33:42.478
with such fine company.

33:44.981 --> 33:48.151
So, enough about me.
What is it you do, again?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.738
I'm a writer
for Olympiad Entertainment.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.032
Thank you.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.993
Uh, wh-- what games
do you write for?

33:56.993 --> 33:58.244
Maybe I've played them.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.748
I've been working
on a new game.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.916
It doesn't have a name yet.
It's still in beta.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.961
But even after it's released,
you probably won't know my work.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.589
I mostly write
non player characters.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.798
What's that?

34:10.882 --> 34:13.050
Background characters
that interact with the players

34:13.134 --> 34:14.469
on their journeys.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.804
Not as high-profile
as programming the leads.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.139
But it's just as important.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.974
For most players,
the background characters

34:19.974 --> 34:22.101
are just cannon fodder.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.481
I'm not doing it
for the players,

34:26.481 --> 34:27.774
I'm doing it for myself.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.526
How so?

34:32.820 --> 34:35.573
Real life can be disappointing.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.870
Not that it's so bad. Just...
there should be more to it.

34:44.207 --> 34:46.250
Maybe you just haven't found
the right man yet.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.425
You sound depressed.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.845
There's tabs for that.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.765
They'll fix you right up.

35:02.850 --> 35:04.060
What if I'm not the one
that's broken?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.895
What if it's the world
that needs fixing?

35:07.188 --> 35:08.606
There's tabs
for that feeling, too.

35:10.983 --> 35:11.984
Of course.

35:15.571 --> 35:16.656
Will you excuse me?

36:06.289 --> 36:07.915
Please stop calling me.
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

36:07.999 --> 36:10.585
<i>Don't hang up.
You need to help me.</i>

36:10.585 --> 36:12.128
<i>- The doctors think I'm crazy.</i>

36:12.128 --> 36:15.506
<i>But I know you're real.
Just like the tower is real.</i>

36:15.590 --> 36:18.050
<i>You need to stop
what you're doing.</i>

36:18.134 --> 36:19.510
I told you,
I'm not doing anything.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.095
<i>You're destroying my life.</i>

36:21.095 --> 36:23.264
I'm not.
I don't even know you.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.807
<i>You can't hide from me.</i>

36:25.349 --> 36:26.475
<i>I will find you.</i>

36:26.559 --> 36:30.271
<i>Do you understand?
You have to end this, or I will.</i>

36:30.271 --> 36:31.898
You need help,
and I hope you get it.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.566
But next time you call,
I'm going to the police.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.484
<i>No, no, don't hang--</i>

36:42.491 --> 36:43.826
<i>Yeah, I'm surprised.</i>

36:43.910 --> 36:45.202
<i>I just bumped
into a work friend.</i>

36:45.286 --> 36:46.329
Oh, really?

36:46.329 --> 36:47.955
<i>I think I'm gonna
be out for a while.</i>

36:48.039 --> 36:49.498
<i>Don't be discouraged
about tonight.</i>

36:49.582 --> 36:50.917
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

36:50.917 --> 36:53.878
Maya, it's fine, really.
Have fun.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.130
<i>Where are you?</i>
I'm almost home.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.883
<i>Okay, good.
I gotta go. You're okay?</i>

36:58.883 --> 37:00.134
Yeah.
<i>Take care.</i>

37:00.134 --> 37:01.219
Bye.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.061
- Sorry about that.
- It's my fault.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.479
I wasn't paying attention.

37:16.359 --> 37:19.612
I, uh, I didn't see you there.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.365
But now I do.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.159
You scared me.

37:26.285 --> 37:29.789
- I guess we're even.
- I'm Peter.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.166
I-- I just have to get home.
My roommate's waiting for me.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.877
I've been wanting to meet you
for such a long time.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.338
- Excuse me?
- I knew you existed.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.466
I was worried you weren't real,
but here you are.

37:41.592 --> 37:42.969
Why are you doing this to us?

37:48.057 --> 37:50.226
It's you. You're the one
who's been calling.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.978
I need to ask you
to leave us alone.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.604
- No.
- No, stop!

37:53.688 --> 37:54.689
Stop! No, no, no!

37:54.689 --> 37:56.023
- No!
- This isn't who I am.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.901
- Get away from me!
- Please, this is important.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.696
I lost my job, my wife.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.239
I thought it was the tower. But...

38:06.450 --> 38:09.662
it was you.
You made me do those things.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.414
All these people do
what you want them to.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.790
I don't know
what you're talking about--

38:12.790 --> 38:14.417
No!
No, no, let me go!

38:14.417 --> 38:15.876
You need to stop!

38:18.713 --> 38:20.256
How did you know
so much about us?

38:21.257 --> 38:22.717
The game.
You wrote us into it. How?

38:22.717 --> 38:25.553
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Pe-- Peter--

38:27.138 --> 38:29.598
I'm so sorry for everything
that's happened to you.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.518
But I have nothing do with that.
I can't help you.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.563
You need to help me.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.231
I need for the story to change.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.941
I need the ending
to be different.

38:42.236 --> 38:46.323
- I'm sorry.
- No!

38:49.994 --> 38:52.413
Get off me, man!

39:13.434 --> 39:15.352
"They heard a voice scream,

39:15.436 --> 39:18.606
'We need our dragon!'

39:18.606 --> 39:21.358
But my father
and the dragon knew

39:21.442 --> 39:24.904
that nothing in the world
would ever make them go back

39:24.904 --> 39:29.158
to Wild Island. The end."

39:29.909 --> 39:32.244
All right. Time to tuck in.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.630
All right.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.007
You and Bear Bear sleep good,
all right?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.844
Can we leave
the lights on tonight?

39:50.346 --> 39:53.015
- Why would we do that?
- Bear Bear's scared.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.184
I told him
I'd keep watch over him.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.730
Well, you know the best way
to keep watch at night

39:59.814 --> 40:02.191
is to turn the lights down
around you and light up--

40:02.191 --> 40:04.443
Light up the perimeter.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.530
That way, no one can see you,
but you can see.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.158
See everyone.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.578
Look, um, Bear Bear doesn't need
to think about this stuff.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.748
Okay? Everyone is safe
and sound.

40:18.874 --> 40:19.875
Promise?

40:22.586 --> 40:23.754
I promise.

40:25.172 --> 40:26.590
Okay, goodnight.

40:35.599 --> 40:38.853
- Did you hear that?
- It's probably nothing.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.030
Goodnight, Mom.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.199
Come on,
let's get you in bed.

40:56.203 --> 41:02.042
♪

41:02.126 --> 41:03.669
Hey.
Fuck!

41:06.755 --> 41:08.549
What the hell is this, Caleb?

41:08.549 --> 41:10.050
There is something
out there.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.846
Yeah. A raccoon or a neighbor
or a delivery man.

41:13.846 --> 41:17.975
We've been through this.

41:17.975 --> 41:22.646
You just need to take
deep breaths. Calm yourself.

41:23.397 --> 41:25.024
The past is in the past.

41:25.024 --> 41:27.985
Nothing is going to hurt you
except your own mind.

41:29.570 --> 41:30.613
I'm sorry.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.750
<i>Are you gonna help me or not?</i>

42:28.963 --> 42:31.048
Peter, I know
that you're upset,

42:31.048 --> 42:32.716
but whatever you think
is happening,

42:33.467 --> 42:34.593
you're just confused.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.889
<i>So you're not gonna help.</i>

42:38.973 --> 42:40.891
I wish I could,
but the stories that I write,

42:40.975 --> 42:42.017
they're not real.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.561
<i>Do you remember how mine ends?</i>

42:47.773 --> 42:48.816
What?

42:52.486 --> 42:54.738
Peter, where are you?
<i>Look up.</i>

43:05.040 --> 43:08.210
Is this up to me,
or did you write this, too?

43:44.413 --> 43:47.291
I found it under her pillow.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.209
You're rubbing
off on her, Caleb.

43:50.085 --> 43:51.045
Isn't that a good thing?

43:51.045 --> 43:53.422
Not when she's pretending
to have PTSD.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.090
I see the messages

43:55.174 --> 43:57.134
you and your war buddies
send to each other.

43:57.134 --> 43:59.303
Chemtrails,
government cover-ups.

43:59.303 --> 44:03.140
You see threats everywhere,
and now so does Frankie.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.976
Look, I am not paranoid.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.068
Maybe you're right.

44:15.277 --> 44:18.447
I'm beginning to think
it's not that you fear war,

44:19.698 --> 44:21.742
- it's that you miss it.
- Oh, my...

44:21.742 --> 44:23.786
This life is too ordinary
for you.

44:25.829 --> 44:26.830
What?

44:28.165 --> 44:31.210
You have a job, a home,

44:32.419 --> 44:38.133
a beautiful child,
and a very patient wife.

44:39.968 --> 44:41.387
But it's never enough, is it?

44:43.180 --> 44:44.181
Hey.

45:05.911 --> 45:07.246
False alarm, Bear Bear.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.083
See? It's just a raccoon.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.752
Crap.

45:53.459 --> 45:54.585
Hey there.

45:58.338 --> 45:59.631
Is your daddy home?

46:03.177 --> 46:05.679
Daddy, this man
wants to talk to you.

46:05.679 --> 46:06.847
Frankie!

46:26.408 --> 46:27.910
I believe this is yours.

46:35.751 --> 46:38.587
- Who are you?
- An old friend.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.340
Caleb!

46:43.300 --> 46:46.303
Frankie! Are you okay?

46:46.303 --> 46:48.430
Go inside.
Okay. Are you okay?

47:00.275 --> 47:01.318
Hello, darling.

47:03.111 --> 47:04.279
It's really you.

47:05.739 --> 47:07.658
You know, I thought...

47:07.658 --> 47:10.285
I was sure I was never gonna
see you again.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.121
And yet here I am,

47:13.205 --> 47:16.792
disposing and dismembering
just like the good old days.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.504
If something happened
to my daughter,

47:20.504 --> 47:21.672
you have no idea--

47:21.672 --> 47:23.006
I have every idea...

47:25.008 --> 47:27.010
which is why
it won't come to that.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.722
I know who sent
those men after us.

47:32.808 --> 47:33.892
William.

47:34.393 --> 47:35.644
He's back at it.

47:56.498 --> 48:00.210
I, uh... Frankie's asleep.
Thank God.

48:01.378 --> 48:04.172
I called Carver.
The guys are downstairs.

48:05.549 --> 48:07.801
All these years,
I thought you were paranoid.

48:12.723 --> 48:14.391
But the war isn't over, is it?

48:18.812 --> 48:21.648
No, it is me they wanted.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.611
Look, I am the one
who brought this upon us.

48:25.611 --> 48:28.447
And I am the one
who has to end it.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.200
So you're leaving.

48:34.786 --> 48:36.204
Only for a little while.

48:38.665 --> 48:41.960
You promised you'd be a father.

48:42.044 --> 48:46.048
I am one.
Everything I do is for you...

48:48.300 --> 48:49.384
and for Frankie.

48:52.804 --> 48:54.348
You're going
to get yourself killed.

48:56.224 --> 48:57.768
Hey, I will come back to you.

48:59.728 --> 49:00.812
I promise.

50:01.415 --> 50:03.125
All right.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.043
You know the drill.
You got it.

50:08.213 --> 50:09.840
I always knew
this day was coming.

50:10.674 --> 50:11.758
As soon as you stop running,

50:11.842 --> 50:13.552
everyone else starts
to catch up.

50:14.720 --> 50:17.597
- Any idea why now?
- I don't know.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.808
But I had a little tête-à-tête

50:19.808 --> 50:21.476
with the one
that they sent after me.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.813
We're not the only ones
William was after.

50:24.813 --> 50:26.398
He was very interested
in talking to

50:26.398 --> 50:28.108
a Senator
in California.

50:28.108 --> 50:29.901
Then we should
get to him first.

50:32.529 --> 50:33.530
We?

50:35.198 --> 50:36.825
I'm coming.

50:36.825 --> 50:38.577
It's the only way
I can protect my family.

50:38.577 --> 50:42.205
I'll be fine on my own.
You can stay here.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.374
- You probably should.
- Would you?

50:46.376 --> 50:47.377
No.

50:50.547 --> 50:51.757
But I'd regret it.

51:20.035 --> 51:21.161
Record pitch.

51:23.872 --> 51:25.373
I want to write a new story.

51:28.543 --> 51:32.422
About a girl...
a girl who's searching.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.595
<i>The girl doesn't know
what she's searching for.</i>

51:46.353 --> 51:51.233
<i>She just knows there
is an emptiness in her life.</i>

51:58.031 --> 51:59.574
<i>Or maybe it's inside her.</i>

52:04.621 --> 52:08.083
And when she finds the thing
she's searching for,

52:08.834 --> 52:10.377
everything will make sense.

52:16.299 --> 52:18.051
I want a story
with a happy ending.

52:32.440 --> 52:33.441
Stupid.

52:35.151 --> 52:37.529
Stupid stories
nobody wants to hear.
