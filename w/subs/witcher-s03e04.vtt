WEBVTT

00:10.958 --> 00:12.875
[wind gusting]

00:14.000 --> 00:14.916
[Geralt] Ciri!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.708
[panting]

00:18.333 --> 00:20.416
[echoing snatches of voices]

00:28.833 --> 00:30.416
[Ciri] I'm not afraid of him anymore.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.458
[screaming]

00:32.166 --> 00:35.416
[Gallatin] The only human
who's gained my loyalty so far is you.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.666
[echoing whisper]

00:36.750 --> 00:38.666
[Ciri] You'll pay for this.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.416
[distorted] Nilfgaardian scum.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.833
Oh…

00:42.916 --> 00:47.083
I've known you since your voice cracked.
Never seen you sleep past dawn.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.500
[Cahir] My lord.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.583
I wanted to welcome you back myself.

00:52.916 --> 00:54.041
[groans]

00:54.125 --> 00:55.875
[soldiers drilling outside]

00:56.750 --> 00:58.083
I have a mission for you.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.416
I-- I, um…

01:01.291 --> 01:04.208
I didn't expect an assignment so soon.

01:04.291 --> 01:09.333
No? Well, you did what I asked you to do
without hesitation, and then…

01:09.416 --> 01:10.666
[Cahir sighs]

01:11.541 --> 01:12.875
Then you cleaned up your mess.

01:13.875 --> 01:17.000
That is all the proof I need
to know that you are ready.

01:18.708 --> 01:22.666
All necessary supplies are
at your disposal. Weapons, transport, men…

01:24.000 --> 01:25.541
[sighs]

01:26.875 --> 01:29.166
But we must move quickly.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.916
[sighs]

01:39.958 --> 01:41.291
[sighs]

01:44.500 --> 01:45.458
This…

01:47.000 --> 01:47.958
This is ambitious.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.791
Francesca will not be an easy target.

01:54.208 --> 01:55.833
Perhaps we should enlist Frin--

01:56.333 --> 01:57.333
[Emhyr] Fringilla?

02:00.375 --> 02:01.625
What became of her?

02:02.375 --> 02:03.291
Hmm?

02:04.041 --> 02:05.041
She is dead.

02:07.166 --> 02:09.666
[sighs] And you are here.

02:16.125 --> 02:20.041
[sighs] You said you knew a good leader
when you saw them.

02:22.000 --> 02:22.958
How?

02:24.625 --> 02:26.833
How do you know
you're doing the right thing?

02:30.666 --> 02:36.416
When you have finished this mission,
we shall have everything that we want.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.625
We'll be able to knock the North over
with a feather,

02:40.708 --> 02:44.208
and I'll have my daughter by my side,
where she belongs.

02:47.416 --> 02:49.666
Let go of the questions.

02:51.458 --> 02:53.916
Embrace what we have done together.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.666
[sighs]

03:00.750 --> 03:02.041
You leave today.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.291
-[door opens]
-[sighs]

03:10.208 --> 03:11.375
[sighs shakily]

03:14.458 --> 03:17.750
[Yennefer] My plan is to open
with a traditional ball.

03:17.833 --> 03:21.083
-Is it me, or is she like a bad fungus?
-[Yennefer] Then spend the next two days

03:21.166 --> 03:24.166
strategizing a Northern alliance
against Nilfgaard.

03:24.250 --> 03:29.083
An alliance led by a traitor will only
serve to fan the flames of division.

03:29.625 --> 03:30.500
-Aye.
-Aye.

03:30.583 --> 03:31.875
Let her speak.

03:31.958 --> 03:34.166
She says she's here to help.
I believe her.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.291
We must set our differences aside

03:39.125 --> 03:42.583
to create a stronghold
between Verden, Kaedwen,

03:42.666 --> 03:44.750
-Temeria, Aedirn, Lyria--
-[chuckling] Oh, come on!

03:44.833 --> 03:45.708
And Redania!

03:45.791 --> 03:49.958
Redania acts in their own interest
with complete disregard for anyone else.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.708
A posture Yennefer understands intimately!

03:53.541 --> 03:56.041
Redania has
the most powerful army in the North.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.250
Foltest's soldiers, Henselt's,

03:58.333 --> 04:01.625
their combined forces are still shy
of what Vizimir could provide us.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.708
We believe Philippa Eilhart
can deliver her king.

04:04.791 --> 04:06.666
-"We"?
-[Vilgefortz] And who is "we"?

04:06.750 --> 04:08.958
Yennefer has my full support.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.833
-[murmuring]
-Of course she has your support!

04:11.916 --> 04:13.375
[Yennefer] If I may…

04:16.541 --> 04:18.916
I would like to thank all of you.

04:19.958 --> 04:22.166
Not only for your cooperation now…

04:24.625 --> 04:26.458
but for your forgiveness of the past.

04:29.583 --> 04:33.333
This conclave is my first step
on the path of regaining your trust.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.958
If we are to unite the Continent,

04:36.041 --> 04:39.541
and let me be clear, we have to,

04:40.125 --> 04:41.458
we must first agree.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.375
No more division.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.875
No more secrets.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.000
We can all be our best selves.

04:53.833 --> 04:54.875
For the Brotherhood.

04:57.791 --> 04:59.500
[wistful music]

05:19.125 --> 05:20.875
Like a fungus.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.416
I felt his hand grab my shoulder.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.958
[birdsong]

05:41.500 --> 05:43.625
Specters aren't supposed
to do that, right?

05:45.125 --> 05:46.166
[sighs]

05:48.500 --> 05:51.750
There's a theory that the monoliths
are conduits to other spheres,

05:51.833 --> 05:55.583
and your power is the key
to opening those conduits.

05:56.791 --> 06:01.375
In Kaer Morhen, you portaled us
to the same sphere the Wild Hunt inhabit.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.416
And left the door open on my way out.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.291
Mm-hmm.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.791
[sighs] Great.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.041
-So now we have to go Aretuza?
-Mm-hmm.

06:11.666 --> 06:15.333
I thought you said it wasn't safe
because of what you saw in the castle.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.333
It's the best option for all of us.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.250
[sighs heavily]

06:22.833 --> 06:23.833
Fine.

06:25.916 --> 06:27.000
What happened?

06:30.208 --> 06:31.666
Why don't you wanna go there?

06:32.916 --> 06:36.958
[sighs] Because it's filled
with catty women who…

06:37.458 --> 06:40.958
who gossip, and get sloppy drunk, and…

06:42.541 --> 06:43.833
[sighs]

06:46.375 --> 06:48.875
And I said some things to Yennefer
that I regret.

06:50.333 --> 06:51.541
She'll forgive you.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.875
[horses nickering]

06:55.875 --> 06:57.666
What if I'm just not good enough?

06:58.708 --> 06:59.625
[Geralt scoffs]

06:59.708 --> 07:02.041
-Your power is beyond measure.
-[Ciri chuckles]

07:02.125 --> 07:04.250
-It's your job to say that.
-Ciri.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.291
This isn't my area of expertise.

07:07.375 --> 07:10.041
Perhaps you're struggling
because you're scared of your abilities?

07:13.666 --> 07:14.625
Maybe,

07:15.750 --> 07:18.916
if you truly embrace
who you are and your power…

07:19.000 --> 07:20.083
[sighs]

07:20.166 --> 07:22.500
…you'll be able to access it
whenever you wish.

07:23.583 --> 07:24.708
[Ciri] Hmm.

07:26.916 --> 07:28.916
[Geralt] And close all doors behind you.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
[optimistic music]

07:38.583 --> 07:41.708
[Yennefer] Invitations are going out
across the Continent.

07:41.791 --> 07:43.625
We expect responses within the day.

07:44.666 --> 07:48.125
[Tissaia] You know, for someone
who disdains politics, you do excel at it.

07:48.208 --> 07:51.250
It's just personal agenda
wrapped up in a different package.

07:51.333 --> 07:54.333
If this is what it takes
to keep us all safe, it's worth it.

07:54.416 --> 07:57.000
The Council already agreed
to the conclave.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.791
You can drop the groveling now.

07:59.916 --> 08:02.083
-[sighs]
-[both laugh]

08:04.458 --> 08:07.375
-This is new.
-Mmm. It's a gift from Vilgefortz.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.208
He says it's for protection.
I say it's for love.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.625
[both chuckle]

08:14.125 --> 08:15.500
I can feel it.

08:15.583 --> 08:18.208
Somewhere, Philippa is rolling her eyes.

08:19.375 --> 08:23.333
You know, I never understood what happened
with you two. You were so close.

08:23.416 --> 08:25.208
There's nothing to understand.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.958
The friendship just ran its course.

08:30.666 --> 08:33.458
Then I think I'll deliver
my invitation to her in person.

08:33.541 --> 08:36.791
Groveling is the sincerest form
of manipulation.

08:36.875 --> 08:37.791
[Triss] Tissaia.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.250
Another novice has gone.

08:40.333 --> 08:43.375
Elizabet. Her room is empty.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.458
[Tissaia] All the rooms are empty.

08:45.958 --> 08:50.083
I told the novices to relocate to Loxia
for the conclave. I'm sure she is fine.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.708
But there was blood. What if she's hurt?

08:52.791 --> 08:55.416
Well, then,
we need to get less clumsy novices.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.791
Um, Yennefer, I hope
your ward can carry herself.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.958
Geralt is bringing Ciri.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.708
He told me everything
that happened at Kaer Morhen.

09:12.666 --> 09:13.666
Thank you.

09:16.708 --> 09:18.916
She's the reason I'm doing all of this.

09:31.583 --> 09:32.500
-[laughs]
-Hey!

09:32.583 --> 09:33.916
-Hi.
-[chuckling] Hey.

09:34.000 --> 09:34.958
Uh--

09:36.041 --> 09:38.625
-I haven't seen you since, uh…
-Since…

09:39.791 --> 09:41.000
-Too long.
-Yeah.

09:41.083 --> 09:41.916
[both chuckle]

09:42.000 --> 09:43.625
You here for the conclave?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.625
Uh, officially, yes.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.833
Unofficially, you're here
for the great reading material.

09:50.625 --> 09:55.208
Oh, so are your clandestine library
excursions far more exciting than this?

09:56.708 --> 09:59.541
Exciting isn't the word.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.250
[sighs] I've been tracking the novices
who've gone missing this year.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.375
Yeah, three or four in my year got scared
they couldn't hack it.

10:08.583 --> 10:12.000
I know these girls.
This feels like something else.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.583
All of them are half elven.
This can't be a coincidence.

10:16.666 --> 10:18.208
[Istredd] What are you thinking?

10:22.625 --> 10:26.250
-I think they've been taken by force.
-Something's been bothering me.

10:27.458 --> 10:31.041
I traveled with the Scoia'tael
for a while, trying to help the elves.

10:31.125 --> 10:34.916
Instead, I watched them instigate the same
cycle of violence that victimized them.

10:36.291 --> 10:40.375
Now, the book I'm looking for,
the Book of Monoliths,

10:40.458 --> 10:43.291
it holds the key
to traveling between spheres.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.416
I thought if I had it,
I could break that cycle,

10:46.500 --> 10:48.916
offer the elves safety
away from the Continent.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.250
But someone at Aretuza beat me to it.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.666
What if the person
who's kidnapping those girls

10:53.750 --> 10:56.625
is planning to use the book
to banish them

10:57.958 --> 10:58.875
for good?

10:59.416 --> 11:01.416
[unsettling music]

11:04.083 --> 11:06.666
-[man] Got some more boxes…
-[Ciri] Chain ferries are slow.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.458
[Geralt] Riding back to Gors Velen
would take longer.

11:09.541 --> 11:11.666
Besides, the passage has
already been arranged.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.208
[man] Gonna take my head off!

11:14.875 --> 11:16.875
[optimistic music]

11:19.041 --> 11:22.750
Well, if it isn't my favorite
pocket-sized princess. How are you?

11:22.833 --> 11:25.125
-[Ciri chuckles]
-How are the lessons going?

11:25.708 --> 11:27.916
Tread lightly around the magic lessons.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.166
He's not actually talking
about my lessons.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.541
He's talking about
your lessons in smiling.

11:36.583 --> 11:37.916
-Work in progress.
-[Jaskier] Yeah.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.083
[chuckles]

11:40.083 --> 11:43.166
-Why are you not on board yet?
-The ferryman won't cross.

11:43.250 --> 11:46.208
He's convinced
there's a monster in the water.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.083
[whimsical music]

11:48.166 --> 11:49.583
Can we go around the gulf?

11:49.666 --> 11:53.208
-[Jaskier] Adds two days to our journey.
-Besides, we're witchers.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.125
Is that so?

11:59.041 --> 12:02.458
Judging by the time of year and the depth
of water in this part of the North Sea,

12:02.541 --> 12:04.916
I doubt it's anything that dangerous.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.416
-Maybe a kelpie--
-Ciri…

12:06.500 --> 12:07.500
[chuckles]

12:07.583 --> 12:11.041
We've been focusing so much on my magic.
What about my hunting skills?

12:12.166 --> 12:14.250
My ability to protect myself.

12:14.916 --> 12:16.833
I wouldn't want that to rust. Would you?

12:24.708 --> 12:26.166
[Geralt] If we kill your monster,

12:26.250 --> 12:28.750
will you accept that
as payment for the passage?

12:28.833 --> 12:31.291
Ah… You've got yourself a deal.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.000
[Jaskier] Yes!

12:35.458 --> 12:36.833
Lessons paying off!

12:39.125 --> 12:40.083
Kinda.

12:40.750 --> 12:41.791
[groans]

12:45.000 --> 12:47.250
[ferryman] Glad I came upon you, witcher.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.666
That beast's been a right pain in my arse.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.458
Put me out of commission.

12:52.375 --> 12:55.958
Between that
and the Wild Hunt ridin' again… [scoffs]

12:57.083 --> 12:59.750
You're far too old
to believe in fairy tales, Obin.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.666
You sound like my wife.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.333
I saw it with my own eyes.

13:04.916 --> 13:07.708
Right up in the sky
above that tower on Thanedd.

13:07.791 --> 13:10.666
Came down on the ground. They were here.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.625
Real. Powerful.

13:14.708 --> 13:17.250
What do they want here?
What do you think it means?

13:17.333 --> 13:21.375
The Wild Hunt is an omen for war, missy.

13:22.291 --> 13:24.500
No one's ever seen them ride amongst us.

13:24.583 --> 13:25.916
This is different.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.958
Humans against halflings.
Dwarves against elves.

13:30.458 --> 13:33.416
A full-on bloody massacre. No survivors.

13:38.166 --> 13:43.333
But perhaps best to leave fortune telling
to the soothsayers, hmm?

13:43.416 --> 13:44.625
[man] No more on the ship!

13:44.708 --> 13:46.833
-[man humming]
-Looks like a peaceful day to me.

13:46.916 --> 13:48.458
[humming grows louder]

13:49.875 --> 13:52.000
Oh, you are fucking kidding me.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.416
-[troupe humming]
-Who is that, Jaskier?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.833
[troupe harmonizing]

14:03.333 --> 14:04.958
Wow. That was…

14:07.500 --> 14:08.333
nice.

14:08.416 --> 14:10.625
-Good to see you again, Valdo Marx.
-Well, hello, Johan.

14:10.708 --> 14:11.666
Jaskier.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.208
-Lovely to see you.
-Good.

14:13.708 --> 14:15.958
[Obin] Mr. Marx, a pleasure to meet you!

14:16.041 --> 14:18.125
Me-- me and the wife are big fans!

14:18.208 --> 14:20.375
-Oh, the pleasure is all mine, good sir.
-Ah!

14:20.458 --> 14:24.166
My troupe is in a bit of a rush.
How much for us all to cross?

14:24.250 --> 14:26.791
For you… oh! Half price!

14:26.875 --> 14:28.791
Half fucking pri-- Are you kidding me?

14:28.875 --> 14:29.750
Ooh… ooh…

14:29.833 --> 14:31.291
[laughing]

14:32.625 --> 14:33.625
Aaah!

14:33.708 --> 14:35.416
The day just got better.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.458
Oi.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.041
[Valdo] That G was sharp.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.500
-[man] Sorry.
-[chuckles]

14:42.541 --> 14:45.041
[Vilgefortz] We appreciate
the urgency of the conclave,

14:45.125 --> 14:47.000
and the stakes for everyone involved.

14:47.583 --> 14:51.666
The Council will create a secure portal
to get you safely to Redania and back.

14:51.750 --> 14:56.000
If the rogue mage is somehow tracking you,
you'll be well camouflaged.

14:57.166 --> 15:01.000
What makes you so sure they're a "he"?
Women can be arseholes too.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.625
What is your agenda here, Yennefer?

15:09.250 --> 15:11.625
Aside from helping
your crumbling organization

15:11.708 --> 15:15.500
regain some semblance of control
before Nilfgaard destroys the Continent?

15:15.583 --> 15:16.791
[laughter in courtyard]

15:16.875 --> 15:19.416
Tissaia will always protect you.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.625
But every time you leave a mess behind,
she's the one who cleans it up.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.875
I won't let her get hurt again.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.583
So if you have some hidden cause,

15:31.333 --> 15:34.333
if you're here to use her
and abandon her again,

15:35.708 --> 15:36.666
tell me now.

15:42.708 --> 15:43.708
I've hidden nothing.

15:44.541 --> 15:45.500
[snorts softly]

15:46.583 --> 15:47.916
I couldn't if I tried.

15:49.791 --> 15:51.458
She knows me at my core.

15:51.958 --> 15:53.541
[poignant music]

15:54.291 --> 15:55.583
And I know her too.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.291
She's softer now.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.375
More trusting.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.250
Open.

16:06.208 --> 16:10.875
For what it's worth, I'm happy to see
the person she's become around you.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.083
[sighs]

16:17.958 --> 16:19.291
Your kindness is

16:20.541 --> 16:21.416
unsettling.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.125
[chuckles]

16:24.208 --> 16:27.125
The procession has started,
and your portal awaits.

16:27.875 --> 16:28.791
Let's go.

16:30.541 --> 16:32.291
[bell tolling]

16:32.375 --> 16:34.375
[mournful music]

16:49.416 --> 16:51.875
[Aplegatt] I'll get to the Navy's
Commander in three days.

16:51.958 --> 16:55.333
[Dijkstra] Make it two. The fate
of the Continent is resting on it.

16:55.416 --> 16:59.208
-Do you have it memorized?
-A head of gold and an arse of iron.

16:59.291 --> 17:00.833
Get on your horse and prove it.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.541
I've consulted our networks.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.958
Rience is a mystery in Nilfgaard too.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.708
All communication goes
through the woman without a voice.

17:13.791 --> 17:15.791
-Ironic.
-Hmm.

17:17.708 --> 17:20.541
You seem nervous. Worried we're wrong?

17:21.500 --> 17:23.375
Oh, our intelligence is sound.

17:23.458 --> 17:24.750
So it's personal?

17:24.833 --> 17:25.958
Hmm.

17:26.916 --> 17:28.625
I simply want definitive answers

17:28.708 --> 17:33.166
before we crash the Brotherhood's party
and start pointing fingers.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.250
What's the word here?

17:35.333 --> 17:39.541
Well, our position has been strengthened
by the influx of sympathy for our queen.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.916
Even King Demavend
is proposing an alliance.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.583
Soon, all the Northern Kingdoms
will be fighting at our behest.

17:45.666 --> 17:47.125
[chuckles] Well done.

17:56.833 --> 17:58.666
[troupe singing quietly]

18:00.291 --> 18:01.208
There.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.875
[loud clanking]

18:05.125 --> 18:07.916
Judging by the size
and frequency of the ripples,

18:08.625 --> 18:10.125
I suspect it's an aeschna.

18:12.208 --> 18:15.333
An aeschna's skin is rough
and covered in spikes,

18:15.416 --> 18:18.916
and difficult to penetrate except for
a tender patch on the top of its skull.

18:20.666 --> 18:24.083
If we lure it into proximity,
we can strike from above

18:24.833 --> 18:28.458
without any harm or damage
to the ferry or anyone on board.

18:29.416 --> 18:30.291
Right?

18:31.041 --> 18:31.958
Right.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.875
Bet you wonder what I'm doing
in this part of the Continent.

18:38.958 --> 18:40.791
You would lose that bet, Valdo.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.541
Me and the troupe are playing
an exclusive gig.

18:43.625 --> 18:45.250
Party of the century.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.750
Upper echelon only.

18:47.375 --> 18:51.333
I was personally requested
by the witch Sabrina Glevissig.

18:52.250 --> 18:56.083
She admires both… my instruments.
If you catch my drift.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.500
-That's not the only thing she'd catch.
-[chuckles]

18:58.583 --> 19:02.125
If only you had one of these…
you could join me.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.833
Pity.

19:03.916 --> 19:07.333
The pity is entirely yours, Valdo.

19:07.416 --> 19:12.000
I… have… been… asked
to do a very important job,

19:12.083 --> 19:15.291
very important…
very important, uh, uh… stakes,

19:15.375 --> 19:18.375
personally requested
by the witch Yennefer of Vengerberg.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.541
Heard of her? Much more important
than your witch. She blew up Sodden.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.208
[loud boom]

19:23.291 --> 19:26.000
[Obin] Have no fear!
We've a witcher on board.

19:26.083 --> 19:29.208
Fear? A churlish cad
whose name I do not know.

19:29.291 --> 19:30.500
[Valdo and Obin chuckle]

19:30.583 --> 19:33.583
You all right there, Jorma?
Need a new pair of breeches?

19:34.083 --> 19:35.583
[wind whistling]

19:36.416 --> 19:39.291
Let's talk about why you're struggling
with your magical abilities.

19:40.416 --> 19:44.375
Your pride in my witchering skills really
would have been a better conversation.

19:45.125 --> 19:45.958
Tough.

19:51.416 --> 19:54.333
I thought if I learned magic…

19:56.208 --> 19:57.750
it would make me a better leader.

19:59.416 --> 20:01.125
Maybe my grandmother was right.

20:01.708 --> 20:04.541
Maybe it's better
to govern with steel and steel alone.

20:04.625 --> 20:05.708
Hmm.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.333
As a witcher,

20:11.416 --> 20:14.666
I will accept coin from someone,
no matter where they're from.

20:15.708 --> 20:19.333
Nations are invisible lines
that people assign meaning to.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.750
A life, however…

20:24.541 --> 20:26.208
A life has real meaning.

20:26.791 --> 20:29.333
It's warm skin and a beating heart.

20:31.916 --> 20:34.375
It should only be taken as a last resort.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.708
Righteousness can easily become rage.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.708
Justice can easily become scorn.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.541
If you want to be a queen,

20:49.458 --> 20:50.666
be a queen.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.083
[poignant music]

20:58.666 --> 21:00.583
I think you'll make an excellent one.

21:05.666 --> 21:07.250
[bell tolling]

21:09.541 --> 21:11.166
[solemn chamber music]

21:11.833 --> 21:13.583
[Vizimir] We are gathered here today

21:14.208 --> 21:15.333
to honor the memory

21:15.875 --> 21:17.666
of my beloved Queen Hedwig.

21:19.166 --> 21:23.500
To many, Queen Hedwig
was a stern and distant figure.

21:24.125 --> 21:28.458
But to me, she was as large in stature
as she was of heart.

21:28.541 --> 21:29.875
-[gasps]
-I'd like a word.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.666
-Is this really the time?
-[Vizimir] Though you were barren…

21:32.750 --> 21:34.916
You'd have made it harder for me
if it wasn't.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.458
[Vizimir] …in many ways,
you were a mother to me.

21:37.541 --> 21:41.541
I was expecting Tissaia
to send a liaison for your little party.

21:42.291 --> 21:45.125
If I'd known it was you,
I would have fire-proofed this place.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.583
-[Vizimir] …and indeed…
-So you're aware of the conclave.

21:47.666 --> 21:51.791
We're Redanian Intelligence. We're aware
of what you ate for bloody breakfast.

21:51.875 --> 21:55.458
Look, I know you haven't been
on good terms with the Brotherhood lately.

21:55.958 --> 21:59.708
But Redania, of all kingdoms, can
appreciate the gravity of the situation.

21:59.791 --> 22:00.791
[Vizimir] Dear brother…

22:00.875 --> 22:04.333
-The need for us to unite against Emhyr.
-[Vizimir] …know you will be there…

22:04.416 --> 22:08.166
-How is your hunt for Rience going? Hmm?
-[Vizimir] …join us in a bedchamber…

22:08.250 --> 22:10.500
-Nice speech.
-[Vizimir] …quite close to our own.

22:10.583 --> 22:13.833
-Show me yours, I'll show you mine.
-But let us think of him no more.

22:13.916 --> 22:18.250
For now, I cry vengeance
on those Nilfgaardian scoundrels!

22:19.000 --> 22:21.375
-We will march into battle…
-[Yennefer] …I understand that…

22:21.458 --> 22:24.000
-[Philippa] Sometimes we are blind to…
-…led by the memory…

22:24.083 --> 22:25.791
-of my queen's steely countenance…
-We both…

22:25.875 --> 22:28.125
-[shushing]
-And we start today!

22:28.833 --> 22:31.250
Right now! Go. Prepare.

22:32.708 --> 22:34.083
In your homes!

22:34.166 --> 22:35.250
[snaps fingers]

22:41.000 --> 22:44.958
-Traitorous elven mage.
-She was just leaving, Your Highness.

22:45.041 --> 22:49.250
I came here to offer
my deepest condolences, my king.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.875
And to assure you that the incident
at the abbey was misguided.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.875
Serving nobility is
a mage's greatest purpose.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.000
I also wanted to invite Philippa

23:03.708 --> 23:05.750
as an honored guest
at the Conclave of Mages.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.250
Which she has no inclination to accept.

23:10.208 --> 23:14.166
In times like these,
monarchs need more reliable protection.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.333
Like the Brotherhood offers.

23:16.416 --> 23:17.666
Completely unnecessary, my lord.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.041
[Yennefer] Just look
at your darling wife's fate.

23:20.125 --> 23:22.000
I insist she attend.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.291
And Dijkstra.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.833
And Radovid.
I won't take no for an answer.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.083
[Philippa sighs]

23:39.583 --> 23:41.583
[wind whistling]

23:44.833 --> 23:46.833
[troupe member] How is this…

23:46.916 --> 23:49.166
[quietly conversing
and tuning instruments]

23:55.375 --> 23:57.375
[woman vocalizing]

24:06.666 --> 24:11.000
This is not to insinuate in any way that
I'm in acceptance of this particular path,

24:12.208 --> 24:14.666
but what will you do if I go to Aretuza?

24:16.458 --> 24:17.500
Go after Rience again?

24:18.708 --> 24:20.458
This is bigger than Rience.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.250
Because of what you saw in that castle?

24:23.333 --> 24:24.875
[Valdo] Again. Be better!

24:24.958 --> 24:26.583
You know you can trust me, right?

24:27.875 --> 24:30.083
I'm still piecing it together myself.

28:14.916 --> 28:16.625
-[Geralt] Yennefer.
-[gasps]

28:17.375 --> 28:18.250
Geralt?

28:18.875 --> 28:19.875
Where are we?

28:19.958 --> 28:20.916
Where's Ciri?

28:21.416 --> 28:24.083
-We don't have much time.
-I thought she was with you.

28:25.666 --> 28:26.791
What happened?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.583
-[distorted buzzing]
-What's wrong?

29:06.666 --> 29:08.416
-[running footsteps]
-[door opens]

29:09.416 --> 29:10.250
Yen.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.916
-Are you all right?
-The portal, it was… it was corrupted.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.666
[breathing heavily]
Like… like it-- it was intercepted.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.083
Don't be dramatic.

29:19.166 --> 29:21.583
Tor Lara's been emitting
strange frequencies lately.

29:21.666 --> 29:22.958
Retrograde nonsense.

29:23.041 --> 29:25.541
No, I was… I was attacked.

29:25.625 --> 29:26.791
An illusion.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.333
It was stellacite ruins and…

29:30.708 --> 29:31.833
a black sea, I…

29:32.458 --> 29:34.458
-I need to talk to Tissaia.
-No.

29:35.833 --> 29:38.250
Something is going on here.
Something sinister.

29:38.916 --> 29:41.458
I know you want this conclave
to bring us together, but…

29:42.458 --> 29:44.208
you need to be careful
who you can trust.

29:45.916 --> 29:47.000
Don't we all?

29:47.916 --> 29:49.916
[melancholy music]

29:53.416 --> 29:54.916
[gasps]

29:56.250 --> 29:57.250
Let me.

-[echoing whoosh]
-[soft squishing]

30:00.333 --> 30:02.458
[breathing shakily]

30:06.916 --> 30:07.750
Yen.

30:08.833 --> 30:09.875
Bringing Ciri here,

30:11.166 --> 30:12.958
it's a bad idea.

30:13.916 --> 30:16.291
But Ciri's power is neither good or bad.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.666
-Her choices will shape her destiny.
-That's not what I meant.

30:22.083 --> 30:23.666
[whispers] It's her blood.

30:24.416 --> 30:25.750
Yes, she's elven.

30:26.541 --> 30:29.708
So am I.
And do you know when I was most dangerous?

30:30.666 --> 30:34.041
When I was desperate.
And powerless. And alone.

30:35.333 --> 30:39.458
And that will not happen to her.
Not as long as I'm around.

30:41.791 --> 30:43.166
[sniffling]

30:45.333 --> 30:47.250
[walking away]

30:51.291 --> 30:52.416
Stellacite…

30:59.333 --> 31:01.541
-[Ciri] It's not too late.
-[troupe chatting]

31:01.625 --> 31:06.083
We could go somewhere remote.
Live off the land, slay beasts.

31:06.583 --> 31:08.000
Look, Ciri…

31:12.750 --> 31:16.625
In that castle, I found young women
who were part of some horrific experiment.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.291
Their bodies melted into a mound
of flesh, and veins, and blood.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.458
Only one of them survived.

31:27.416 --> 31:28.708
Her name is Teryn.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.083
And she believes that she is you.

31:34.958 --> 31:35.875
What do you mean?

31:35.958 --> 31:38.041
They've implanted your memories

31:38.916 --> 31:40.125
into her head.

31:41.583 --> 31:45.250
Whoever Rience is working for,
their ultimate plan is to manipulate you.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.666
And those women,
they're using them as test subjects.

31:51.791 --> 31:54.875
There's nothing I want more
than to return to our normal life, but--

31:54.958 --> 31:57.958
We have to protect more of these women
from getting hurt.

31:59.875 --> 32:01.708
And find the mage who's behind this.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.083
That's why we have to go to Aretuza.

32:16.125 --> 32:18.125
[lively music]

32:33.000 --> 32:34.166
[cheering]

32:45.458 --> 32:47.333
I'm not dead!

32:50.500 --> 32:52.916
-Ooh, surely we are needed elsewhere.
-Mmm…

32:53.000 --> 32:53.916
No.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.250
I'm okay, actually.

33:01.083 --> 33:02.250
Gregor, I'm empty.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.541
What? You can't get more ale
for a fortnight?

33:04.625 --> 33:06.166
I just said I'm parched.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.041
This is a bloody tavern.
What the fuck do we do without ale?

33:09.125 --> 33:12.666
Aretuza has drained us dry. Every
bloody mage in the world will be there.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.208
-You know how that lot fucking drink.
-Boy, don't I.

33:15.291 --> 33:16.208
Well…

33:17.291 --> 33:19.000
at least I'm not a mage.

33:19.083 --> 33:23.166
That's just the start of our problems.
The roads aren't safe for the caravans.

33:23.250 --> 33:26.541
I'm hearing boats are goin' missin'
up and down the western coast.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.833
-War is in the air, Gregor.
-You say "boats"?

33:30.041 --> 33:32.291
[Gregor] Who keeps
filling these with flowers?

33:35.458 --> 33:36.583
Will this shut you up?

33:37.208 --> 33:38.291
We'll have to see.

33:39.291 --> 33:41.458
Whilst he tells me about the boats.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.500
-[woman] …head injury!
-[Boris] I forgot. Across the hair, it…

33:46.583 --> 33:48.791
[Valdo] Boris! You're on pitch!

33:48.875 --> 33:51.666
[Yennefer] So, the intrepid explorers
have arrived.

33:52.416 --> 33:54.583
You look like you had quite the adventure.

33:57.291 --> 33:59.791
You stink. Vile.

33:59.875 --> 34:02.375
-[troupe begin playing]
-What happened to you, Yen?

34:03.916 --> 34:05.041
Are you all right?

34:05.875 --> 34:08.208
-I'm fine. I'll tell you later.
-[bards harmonizing]

34:08.291 --> 34:11.000
[Geralt] Yes, we have
a few things to discuss.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.625
[Jaskier] Hello again, witch.
I know you were too embarrassed

34:13.708 --> 34:18.083
to invite a big name like me
to headline at the, uh, conclave thingy,

34:18.166 --> 34:19.875
but I just wanted to let you know I'm…

34:19.958 --> 34:25.000
[loudly] I'm happy to do the other,
very important job that you requested.

34:26.333 --> 34:29.958
Excellent.
You'll be looking after Ciri tonight.

34:30.041 --> 34:32.458
-What?
-[Jaskier] I mean, I was vamping, come on.

34:34.208 --> 34:35.333
I shouldn't have left.

34:36.666 --> 34:37.916
I'm sorry.

34:39.541 --> 34:42.958
I shouldn't have given you
a reason to leave. I'm sorry.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.541
Let's never do that again.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.166
[quiet music]

34:55.083 --> 34:57.666
Jaskier, if you would.

34:58.750 --> 34:59.708
[Jaskier] Hmm?

35:00.250 --> 35:02.583
Ooh, yes. Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Come on, kiddo.

35:02.666 --> 35:06.500
Why don't you tell me all about
how you slayed the sea monster

35:06.583 --> 35:11.000
all on your own whilst Geralt sat around
on his arse all afternoon, eh?

35:16.791 --> 35:20.666
[as Yennefer] "Oh! What the hell
were you thinking, fighting monsters?"

35:21.250 --> 35:25.125
-That's not what she's saying.
-Now, that is the role of poetry, Ciri.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.750
To say what others cannot utter.

35:30.541 --> 35:34.333
[as Geralt] "Oh, you fed her
to the magical lion's den. I trusted you."

35:35.208 --> 35:37.625
-You're just making this all up.
-[Jaskier chuckles]

35:37.708 --> 35:39.750
Meh. That's also the role of poetry.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.458
[as Yennefer] "At least
she was in disguise there."

35:42.541 --> 35:43.916
"Not clanging stupid swords

35:44.000 --> 35:46.500
when I told her
not to draw attention to herself."

35:46.583 --> 35:47.666
[Ciri clears throat]

35:47.750 --> 35:48.791
-[growls]
-[Jaskier laughs]

35:48.875 --> 35:50.541
[as Geralt] "Funny,
I wonder how she learned

35:50.625 --> 35:53.833
such complete
and utter disregard for authority."

35:53.916 --> 35:55.500
That was a good one. [laughs]

35:55.583 --> 35:58.166
-"You're unbelievable!" [laughs]
-"You're delusional!"

36:02.125 --> 36:05.958
"I forgive you
for your various foolish words and deeds."

36:06.625 --> 36:08.041
"Your lack of faith and hope."

36:09.000 --> 36:11.500
"For your obstinacy. Doggedness."

36:12.291 --> 36:15.041
"For your sulking and posing,
which are unworthy of a man."

36:16.125 --> 36:19.333
"I forgive you for being a wily witch

36:19.416 --> 36:21.333
who rarely listens

36:21.416 --> 36:24.166
and even more rarely
admits to being wrong."

36:24.958 --> 36:29.291
"Who is stubborn,
and stuck-up, and self-righteous."

36:31.083 --> 36:32.166
"Let's never do that again."

36:33.583 --> 36:35.708
[Jaskier as Yennefer]
"Mmm. Oh. Oh! Oh yes, take me."

36:35.791 --> 36:38.041
[as Geralt] "Do that thing
with the tongue that I like."

36:38.125 --> 36:39.583
"Oh, you mean this? Bleugh, bleugh!"

36:39.666 --> 36:42.625
"Oh yeah, that's the stuff.
Is there a unicorn nearby, by any chance?"

36:42.708 --> 36:44.708
-[both laughing]
-"Oh!"

36:47.750 --> 36:48.833
[Ciri sighs]

36:49.708 --> 36:50.666
Come on, you deviant.

36:52.125 --> 36:53.791
[wistful music]

37:06.875 --> 37:08.125
[music fades]

37:09.875 --> 37:10.916
Give me all your money.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.458
[lively music]

37:16.291 --> 37:20.250
-Oh, come on! Every time!
-[laughs]

37:20.333 --> 37:22.375
-Wh-- Ah-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Ha-ha!

37:22.458 --> 37:24.375
I thought we were playing for fun.

37:24.458 --> 37:27.291
I assure you, it truly is a delight
taking your coin.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.875
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.416
[sighs]

37:36.000 --> 37:39.875
Um… I'm sorry you're here with me.
Instead of at the party.

37:39.958 --> 37:40.916
Oh, I'm not.

37:42.291 --> 37:45.791
Valdo's off-key warbling
would make my ears bleed.

37:45.875 --> 37:46.875
[Ciri chuckles]

37:46.958 --> 37:49.583
Besides, I'm better off here.

37:51.083 --> 37:52.041
Playing nanny.

37:54.000 --> 37:54.833
Hey.

37:56.208 --> 37:57.416
You don't have to do that.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.416
You don't have to prove
what you're going to be in the future.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.041
My two orens?

38:08.958 --> 38:10.875
I think you're pretty all right right now.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.958
[chuckles]

38:13.833 --> 38:15.958
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

38:16.041 --> 38:17.291
[chuckles]

38:17.375 --> 38:19.375
Ah, it's all part of my hustle.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.041
Just wait until this next hand.

38:22.125 --> 38:25.625
I'm going to mop the floor
with your royal arse, milady.

-What is she to you?
-She is the one who was prophesied.

43:02.625 --> 43:03.875
Hen Ichaer.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.708
A savior of the elves
who will lead them to their rightful home.

43:07.791 --> 43:09.125
What is she to you?

43:09.208 --> 43:13.041
She is a princess
who deserves to be in her rightful home.

43:15.458 --> 43:17.500
There is a way to both get what we want.

43:18.583 --> 43:20.708
But it will require cooperation.

43:21.208 --> 43:22.416
[Dara] He's using you.

43:23.500 --> 43:26.041
It's what they do. He can't be trusted.

43:27.291 --> 43:28.208
What of Fringilla?

43:29.666 --> 43:31.791
Did she abandon her post as well?

43:34.166 --> 43:36.750
There seems to be a theme
among your allies, Cahir.

43:38.583 --> 43:39.833
Why should I trust you?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.041
Because it's the only choice you've got.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.250
Your people have lost enough.

43:50.458 --> 43:51.750
Don't let them lose you too.

43:54.416 --> 43:56.416
[poignant music]

44:01.791 --> 44:04.833
This is our first mission as allies.

44:12.125 --> 44:13.250
Together.

44:14.666 --> 44:15.875
For the White Flame.

44:18.500 --> 44:19.833
For the White Flame.

44:35.708 --> 44:40.208
[Aplegatt] I hereby bring official word
to the King's Navy of Redania.

44:40.291 --> 44:42.166
By order of Sigismund Dijkstra,

44:42.250 --> 44:46.791
reinforcements are required
at Aretuza at first dawn.

44:47.750 --> 44:51.833
Reinforcements are required
at Aretuza at first dawn.

44:52.458 --> 44:54.375
Reinforcements are required--

44:54.458 --> 44:55.875
[neighs]

45:02.416 --> 45:04.416
[water dripping]

45:07.875 --> 45:09.833
I never knew
these tunnels were under Aretuza.

45:09.916 --> 45:12.125
[Istredd] The elves created
secret passages everywhere,

45:12.208 --> 45:15.291
and clearly… you didn't sneak out enough.

45:15.375 --> 45:18.291
No. I stayed above ground
like normal people.

45:18.375 --> 45:20.750
-Well, you said we needed privacy.
-It's Yennefer.

45:21.958 --> 45:25.125
-She was attacked in the portal.
-Attacked? What happened? Is she okay?

45:25.208 --> 45:27.750
Yes. But those novices aren't.

45:27.833 --> 45:32.958
We keep talking about a rogue mage,
but the enemy is here, Istredd. Among us.

45:33.041 --> 45:35.458
Yeah, the person who took
the Book of Monoliths.

45:36.833 --> 45:40.750
We can test that theory.
Yen had stellacite dust on her.

45:41.375 --> 45:45.416
What are the chances your book does too?
A locator spell could show us.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.625
Take my hand.

45:52.708 --> 45:53.750
Repeat with me.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.208
[speaking in Elder]

46:01.125 --> 46:04.541
[both repeating spell]

46:04.625 --> 46:06.541
[portentous music]

46:08.041 --> 46:09.958
[both continue repeating spell]

46:15.041 --> 46:15.958
[Triss gasps]

46:16.750 --> 46:18.791
-Holy shit.
-Oh shit.

46:18.875 --> 46:20.041
-You saw that?
-Yeah.

46:23.083 --> 46:25.333
It was you. The illusion.

46:26.458 --> 46:29.000
But it was dead inside.
It was trying to kill me.

46:29.083 --> 46:30.833
[Geralt] Sounds like it almost did.

46:30.916 --> 46:32.916
It didn't have a chance. I obliterated it.

46:34.125 --> 46:34.958
[sighs]

46:36.083 --> 46:39.125
It's all connected, isn't it?
Everything that's happening.

46:40.333 --> 46:42.416
Whoever's backing Rience is here.

46:43.791 --> 46:46.166
And they know
we're close to sniffing them out.

46:48.250 --> 46:50.458
-Who uses illusions…
-Hates me…

46:50.541 --> 46:53.083
And has a history
of experimenting on young women?

46:58.208 --> 46:59.125
[both] Stregobor.

47:00.375 --> 47:03.250
We have to be smart.
It'll be our word against his.

47:03.333 --> 47:06.041
He won't have any words,
because I'm going to kill him.

47:06.125 --> 47:09.291
Geralt, if we strike first
without solid proof,

47:09.833 --> 47:13.416
we'll only throw the mages and Northern
Kingdoms into further suspicion.

47:14.208 --> 47:15.208
And division.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.291
And hand Nilfgaard the Continent
in the process.

47:19.333 --> 47:22.750
If Stregobor is behind this,
he's a traitor to the Brotherhood.

47:23.583 --> 47:25.958
They'll do far worse to him
than even you could.

47:26.041 --> 47:28.250
You're asking me to play at politics.

47:28.333 --> 47:32.333
I'm asking you to play along.
Let this unfold at the conclave.

47:32.416 --> 47:34.625
We will not let him hurt Ciri.

47:35.458 --> 47:36.291
I promise.

47:37.083 --> 47:39.958
No one will get to her
with the spell I put on the cabin.

47:41.083 --> 47:42.750
She'll be safe until the morning.

47:43.958 --> 47:44.916
[gentle music]

47:45.000 --> 47:46.041
And I have you.

47:48.541 --> 47:49.500
The real you.

47:50.375 --> 47:51.458
In the flesh.

47:54.541 --> 47:55.708
He can't hurt us.

48:02.833 --> 48:05.083
[deep rumbling]

48:07.958 --> 48:09.833
[ominous music]

48:23.416 --> 48:25.166
[Dijkstra] Are you sure about this?

48:25.875 --> 48:26.958
[Philippa] Mmm.

48:27.041 --> 48:29.916
We get our answers. Then we act.

48:46.750 --> 48:48.375
[Triss] Are you sure about this?

48:49.625 --> 48:50.875
We do this together.

48:57.583 --> 49:00.041
[dramatic, ominous music continues]

49:17.416 --> 49:20.000
-Are you sure about this?
-Not in the slightest.

49:23.541 --> 49:25.666
[Geralt] No one told me
I'd have to dress up.

49:25.750 --> 49:29.000
[Yennefer] I'm sorry.
Can you not tolerate a little discomfort?

49:32.958 --> 49:35.125
Lilac and gooseberries.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.708
Now that, I can tolerate.

49:38.375 --> 49:39.750
Are you sure about this?

49:40.916 --> 49:42.583
[sighing] Are you?

49:45.166 --> 49:47.250
[dramatic music builds]

50:00.583 --> 50:02.416
