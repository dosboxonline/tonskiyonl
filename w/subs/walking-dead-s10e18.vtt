26:22.958 --> 26:24.001
Bye.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.301
I thought you were going.

26:35.429 --> 26:36.555
I am.

26:40.267 --> 26:44.146
I get it, you know,
being out here by yourself.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.067
You've been out here alone
for a long time, too, huh?

26:50.903 --> 26:52.988
Lost track a long time ago.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.493
LEAH: This frostnip?

26:59.161 --> 27:01.205
I had it before, ain't no big deal.

27:03.081 --> 27:06.168
LEAH: No big deal till you lose
a couple of fingers or a whole hand.

27:09.755 --> 27:10.964
Come on.

(LEAH GRUNTS)

27:47.751 --> 27:48.919
It's his birthday today.

28:04.601 --> 28:06.854
I didn't have a family growing up.

28:08.438 --> 28:09.690
Not the good kind, anyway.

28:12.276 --> 28:14.736
So, I knew I'd have to find
my own way,

28:14.820 --> 28:16.572
my own family.

28:17.114 --> 28:19.199
And I found that with my squad.

28:19.825 --> 28:22.619
We fought side by side, for years.

28:23.787 --> 28:24.872
When the world went to hell,

28:24.955 --> 28:26.832
we swore to stay together,
to fight together.

28:30.294 --> 28:33.130
They gave me hope and...

28:35.465 --> 28:37.593
...I tried to give that to my son.

28:46.018 --> 28:49.229
Matthew was my son. (SOBS)

28:52.316 --> 28:55.277
I didn't give birth to him,
but he was mine.

28:57.988 --> 28:59.615
He was born to my sister.

29:02.868 --> 29:04.411
That's what I called her, anyway.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.084
I lost her when he was born.

29:14.755 --> 29:16.381
This doesn't matter.

29:18.467 --> 29:19.551
He's gone.

30:19.319 --> 30:20.737
I held Matthew tight.

30:24.825 --> 30:26.702
Dog's mama was next to me.

30:28.996 --> 30:30.205
She was pregnant.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.170
The dead came from all sides.

30:36.295 --> 30:40.883
There was so much screaming

30:40.966 --> 30:42.676
and so much blood.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.387
I...

30:47.723 --> 30:49.975
I was separated from my family
and I ran.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.730
I felt like I ran forever.

30:54.855 --> 30:59.693
Then I ended up here,
and I saw my boy was bit.

31:07.826 --> 31:09.203
(LEAH CONTINUES SOBBING)

31:13.957 --> 31:17.377
I said goodbye to him
the same day Dog was born.

31:22.966 --> 31:25.427
I haven't seen another soul
out here since.

My brother.

31:58.585 --> 32:01.672
-How?
-It was an accident.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.717
Never found the body.

32:06.552 --> 32:08.804
And you think he's still out there?

32:11.098 --> 32:12.391
I don't know.

32:15.435 --> 32:18.146
But I'm not gonna stop
till I find out.

33:48.987 --> 33:50.322
You ain't gonna talk to me?

34:13.971 --> 34:15.848
It's only gonna be for a few days.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.392
Where do you belong, Daryl?

34:21.770 --> 34:24.273
Looking for your dead brother,
day after day after day?

34:25.440 --> 34:27.818
Or do you belong
with the family you left?

34:27.943 --> 34:29.778
Because it was too hard
to face what happened,

34:29.862 --> 34:31.738
or do you belong here with me?

34:37.744 --> 34:38.954
I don't know.

Sorry. I'm just busy.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.166
What's up?

35:24.291 --> 35:25.792
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

35:25.876 --> 35:27.085
Does this mean you're coming back?

35:27.169 --> 35:29.880
No. Just moving.
Too many dead around here.

35:32.466 --> 35:33.800
Here.

35:34.384 --> 35:36.094
Couldn't stand the thought of you

35:36.178 --> 35:38.096
wearing that
ratty old thing anymore.

35:39.223 --> 35:40.849
You gonna tell me
why you really came?

35:42.768 --> 35:44.811
What? Can't I bring a friend a gift?

35:50.984 --> 35:53.403
I came because I wanted to tell you

35:53.487 --> 35:55.864
that it might be a while
before I come back.

35:57.366 --> 35:58.408
Okay.

Things are really tough
at The Kingdom

and Henry, too.

36:08.544 --> 36:10.337
-No.
-You don't need to ask my permission

36:10.462 --> 36:12.256
to move on with your life.

That's not what this is about.

-I just...
-You want me to move on with mine, right?

36:20.222 --> 36:22.558

out here, okay?

-It's not an accusation.

-You didn't walk away, Daryl.

I did. I was down by that river.

you lose someone,

it's because of you,
something you did wrong.

-We all make mistakes.

39:52.351 --> 39:54.144
But I'm not sorry
for going after the horde,

39:54.269 --> 39:55.979
and I'm not sorry
for making Alpha pay

39:56.063 --> 39:58.065
for killing Henry
because I was right.

what you want to say?

-Hunting?

-I wanted to help.
-No. You wanted to run.

So, you ran.

-What?
-Alexandria? What the skins did?

40:31.390 --> 40:35.060
You couldn't deal with the guilt.
So, you made it my problem.

40:35.227 --> 40:38.063
Your only problem is thinking
you have to save everybody.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.983
I don't need a savior, Daryl,
and I don't need a martyr.

40:41.108 --> 40:42.150
I just need a friend.

Friends don't have the same damn
conversation over and over again.

It's what's been happening.
I'm sick of it!

get back on the boat.

40:58.667 --> 40:59.710
I should have.

and I shouldn't have.

I know where I'm supposed to be.
