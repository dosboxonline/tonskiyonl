WEBVTT

02:12.521 --> 02:15.561
The things you saw...they're here.

02:24.841 --> 02:27.361
Find Emily,
and meet me at the back entrance.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.280
Go!

02:36.561 --> 02:37.561
Ash!

03:45.241 --> 03:46.441
What's happening?

03:47.440 --> 03:50.270
Those things are here.
We have to go, now.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.300
Stay behind me.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.681
What about the babies?

03:55.881 --> 03:56.801
Ash!

04:10.520 --> 04:12.140
- Mum there's something outside.
- I know.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.600
Come on, we've got to go.

04:15.601 --> 04:17.841
Mum, it's fine. I can see.

04:53.480 --> 04:53.880
What's that?

04:53.920 --> 04:55.070
It doesn't matter. We have to go back!

04:55.090 --> 04:55.920
They're waiting for us.

04:55.921 --> 04:56.881
No, no, no, the babies...

04:57.041 --> 04:59.081
You won't make it, Ash! Go!

05:07.721 --> 05:08.681
Mum...

05:08.840 --> 05:09.640
What's wrong?

05:09.961 --> 05:11.481
I can feel something.

05:11.761 --> 05:12.841
What do you feel?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.860
I don't know, but it's getting stronger.

05:16.241 --> 05:17.681
Okay, let's head back.

05:20.140 --> 05:21.380
In here!

07:07.241 --> 07:09.361
Come on, come this way, this way...

07:19.081 --> 07:20.001
Wait, wait, wait!

07:21.001 --> 07:22.321
We can't just leave them.

07:23.561 --> 07:24.921
You, you owe me!

07:25.561 --> 07:26.401
Please.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.840
It's too dangerous.

07:30.340 --> 07:31.520
You will die!

07:32.240 --> 07:32.920
Look here.

07:32.940 --> 07:33.680
Yes, you know!

07:33.721 --> 07:34.441
Come on!

07:34.601 --> 07:35.441
Mum!

07:38.680 --> 07:39.720
Come on, let's go!

10:24.780 --> 10:26.400
Sacha!

10:45.961 --> 10:47.441
How much further is it?

10:47.721 --> 10:50.081
About 10 km.

10:51.921 --> 10:53.441
Is it where you grew up?

10:55.360 --> 10:56.860
My parents still live there and

10:56.880 --> 10:59.160
my son went to stay with them
for the holidays.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.321
How old is he?

11:01.921 --> 11:03.081
He's 15.

11:06.201 --> 11:08.161
You want me to do the math for you?

11:09.881 --> 11:11.841
I was 15 when I had him.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.280
Oh, that's fine.

11:16.521 --> 11:18.201
I get it all the time.

11:19.641 --> 11:22.361
At first people think I'm his sister, but..ah...

11:22.520 --> 11:23.790
when they learn I'm his mother

11:23.810 --> 11:25.690
I can see in their faces...

11:27.321 --> 11:28.521
"slut!"

11:29.281 --> 11:30.801
Come on, I'm sure that's not true.

11:32.281 --> 11:33.721
How do you know?

11:34.761 --> 11:36.241
Sorry, I was just...

11:38.081 --> 11:40.401
Yeah, people can be really shitty sometimes.

11:58.995 --> 12:00.605
Don't worry about it.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.840
Maybe we can find them

12:10.382 --> 12:13.532
by tracking their sounds.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.470
What do you need?

12:16.293 --> 12:20.213
We need the parabolic dish to
locate the source.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.550
We have to fix the dishes

12:25.290 --> 12:27.470
and connect them to the generator.

12:27.493 --> 12:29.583
Can they detect it?

12:32.115 --> 12:33.315
Yes.

13:14.641 --> 13:15.881
I'm tired.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.240
I know.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.040
You'll be able to sleep soon.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.120
Emily?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.020
My sight's gone again.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.280
I can't see anything.

13:27.281 --> 13:28.281
Right, here we go.

13:51.481 --> 13:52.481
Thank you.

14:25.441 --> 14:27.561
There is nothing you could have done.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.881
You could have died for them.

14:31.281 --> 14:32.601
It would have been for nothing.

14:34.401 --> 14:36.841
She would have wanted me
to look after them.

14:39.081 --> 14:40.121
Who?

14:57.841 --> 14:59.601
My girlfriend, Hayley...

15:03.241 --> 15:04.961
She was 14 weeks.

15:07.441 --> 15:08.961
We were going to have a boy.

15:36.441 --> 15:38.081
If you don't want to go, we...

15:39.120 --> 15:40.920
...we could stay another day...

15:43.560 --> 15:47.680
But...but if we're going to go, we should...

15:48.161 --> 15:49.441
we should go now.

15:51.721 --> 15:52.681
Helen?

16:34.568 --> 16:36.638
The potentiometer is working.

16:45.475 --> 16:48.135
The dishes are detecting something.

16:49.880 --> 16:54.360
We can use a different algorithm
to clean up the sound.

17:00.180 --> 17:02.170
I've found the source.

17:03.742 --> 17:05.082
It moving.

17:06.660 --> 17:07.980
Where's it going?

17:08.380 --> 17:09.490
I'm trying to follow it.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.900
The signal's getting weaker.
Is it flying?

17:11.920 --> 17:13.420
The signal's dropping out.

17:13.470 --> 17:14.829
Do something.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.000
We're losing it.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.150
It's gone.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.200
What's its last position?

17:26.319 --> 17:29.620
44.7472 degrees North.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.530
5.7691 degrees East.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.520
It's nearby...

17:38.270 --> 17:39.400
in this valley.

17:41.880 --> 17:46.080
The signal was constant for 24 hours
and now it suddenly disappears...

17:48.720 --> 17:51.320
Maybe they've detected us.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.160
We're going to take a look.

17:55.210 --> 17:56.420
Nathan, get the men ready.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.580
Yes, Colonel.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.520
What about me?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.480
I leave some men here.

18:09.530 --> 18:13.210
They can provide security here, okay?

18:14.280 --> 18:18.760
I should stay here, but ...

18:18.880 --> 18:20.560
You want answers.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.840
We leave in an hour.

18:32.641 --> 18:34.121
Do you want some water?

18:35.001 --> 18:35.961
Thanks.

18:43.721 --> 18:45.321
What is the thing you are

18:45.481 --> 18:46.961
doing with your hands?

18:47.521 --> 18:48.881
Piano practice.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.460
It's weird the things you miss.

18:52.921 --> 18:55.521
Your accent...where are you from?

18:56.081 --> 18:57.241
Sudan.

18:57.601 --> 18:59.121
You're a long way from home.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.830
There is a civil war in my country.

19:03.481 --> 19:05.481
I came to escape the fighting.

19:06.961 --> 19:08.281
That went well.

19:12.801 --> 19:15.561
Is that how you know about
guns and stuff?

19:17.801 --> 19:19.121
Maybe I should get a gun?

19:20.040 --> 19:21.620
I don't know if...

19:22.001 --> 19:23.521
That was a joke.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.041
'Cause...

19:28.761 --> 19:30.801
Can you tell me about where you're from?

19:32.801 --> 19:33.921
Please?

19:44.681 --> 19:47.681
It's a small village in the South,

19:48.681 --> 19:50.401
by the White Nile river.

19:53.401 --> 19:54.881
It's beautiful.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.560
What's that?

20:13.520 --> 20:17.670
It is a present from Johannes.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.920
It's my birthday soon.

20:20.850 --> 20:24.266
There are so many people I will never see again.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.300
It's so hard to believe.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.366
Aren't you going to open it?

20:27.433 --> 20:30.810
Yes...but not now.

20:34.168 --> 20:35.688
Here, let me help.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.620
It is normal to be scared.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.180
Aren't you ever afraid?

20:48.320 --> 20:49.140
Yes, yes.

20:50.906 --> 20:54.196
But over time you learn
to hide your fear.

20:55.591 --> 20:57.841
Not too tight?

21:26.760 --> 21:28.130
You want me to go in first?

21:28.160 --> 21:29.310
No.

22:26.401 --> 22:28.001
There is nobody here.

22:29.201 --> 22:30.321
Whose is this?

22:30.481 --> 22:31.961
It was on the sofa.

22:35.561 --> 22:36.441
ChloÃ©...

22:36.761 --> 22:37.721
Wait!

22:41.480 --> 22:42.980
Those things are here!
They'll hear you!

22:43.010 --> 22:44.320
You need to be here...

22:45.881 --> 22:47.601
You're going to get us both killed!

22:47.760 --> 22:48.670
You need to be here for him

22:48.690 --> 22:50.160
for when he comes home.

22:50.801 --> 22:51.841
Come on.

23:54.961 --> 23:56.681
There's enough stuff...

23:56.740 --> 23:58.230
What colour is this one?

23:58.260 --> 23:59.480
It's purple.

24:59.561 --> 25:01.721
If he's dead it's because of me.

25:05.041 --> 25:08.041
I have sent Sacha away to my parents.

25:12.801 --> 25:14.921
I needed a break from him.

25:18.121 --> 25:20.841
Because he's very difficult sometimes, and...

25:23.761 --> 25:25.801
He didn't want to go, and...

25:27.881 --> 25:29.321
we fought.

25:33.481 --> 25:35.681
But I sent him away.

25:37.180 --> 25:39.200
You didn't know what was going to happen.

25:40.801 --> 25:42.641
He said he hated me.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.660
And I said sometimes,

25:49.700 --> 25:51.080
"I hate you too."

25:54.041 --> 25:55.761
I love him so much.

25:57.961 --> 25:59.361
He knows that.

26:03.321 --> 26:04.441
He knows.

26:05.801 --> 26:08.561
Do you really believe your family's alive?

26:11.081 --> 26:12.521
Yeah, I have to.

26:14.161 --> 26:16.161
It's the only way to keep going.

26:20.081 --> 26:21.201
I'm sorry.

26:22.201 --> 26:23.321
It's fine.

26:29.441 --> 26:31.201
Do you know how to use that?

26:34.921 --> 26:36.241
Not even remotely.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.570
I design advertising campaigns

26:40.590 --> 26:42.160
soap and toothpastes.

26:44.201 --> 26:45.561
I guess I should learn.

26:56.897 --> 26:58.277
Who are you?

26:59.000 --> 26:59.710
Hey what's...

26:59.730 --> 27:01.190
Put the weapon down.

27:01.230 --> 27:01.980
No, no, no!

27:02.001 --> 27:03.681
It's okay! It's okay!

27:04.280 --> 27:05.060
How did you get that?

27:05.200 --> 27:07.160
I...I don't speak French.

27:07.262 --> 27:08.492
He doesn't speak French.

27:10.275 --> 27:11.285
Shasha!

27:16.760 --> 27:18.370
I was worried to death!

27:18.420 --> 27:19.510
Are you okay?

27:19.580 --> 27:21.540
Are you injured?

27:21.570 --> 27:22.610
No, I'm fine.

27:22.986 --> 27:24.956
I knew you were coming back.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.800
Where are Grandma and Grandpa?

27:35.466 --> 27:37.876
Sorry.

27:42.222 --> 27:44.962
I will never abandon you again.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.700
I thought you were....

27:49.710 --> 27:53.180
It's been such a long time.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.930
Are you all right, Mom?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.260
You look shocked.

28:01.260 --> 28:01.980
Yes.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.670
Oh, this is my partner.

28:03.730 --> 28:04.550
Hello.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.840
Who is that?

28:08.160 --> 28:11.440
It's Jonathan. We walked here together.

28:11.540 --> 28:13.440
This is my son, Sacha.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.270
Hi.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.160
Hello.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.650
We were on our way home,

28:25.810 --> 28:27.940
looking for a hiding place.

28:30.200 --> 28:34.120
It was like Grandma and Grandpa
had a stroke.

28:35.324 --> 28:37.084
I tried to help them.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.560
The people around me
fell down dead.

28:41.946 --> 28:43.486
I couldn't anything.

28:46.441 --> 28:47.561
He's very brave.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.610
He stayed really calm.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.350
It was very brave of him.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.960
Where are Mum and Dad now?

29:02.440 --> 29:04.060
We buried them in the garden.

29:04.580 --> 29:06.270
We can go and see them if you want.

29:08.186 --> 29:09.556
Yes, please.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.440
Don't stay outside for too long.

29:14.290 --> 29:15.490
Alexi?

29:18.290 --> 29:19.940
Go with them.

29:20.270 --> 29:21.500
No, it's okay.

29:21.650 --> 29:22.550
It's better.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.480
Are you hungry?

29:33.960 --> 29:34.770
Yes.

29:34.881 --> 29:35.961
Do you want something to eat?

29:36.200 --> 29:37.560
Ah...yeah, thanks.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.260
Thank you for bringing my sister home.

29:42.921 --> 29:44.401
We were heading the same way.

29:46.921 --> 29:48.841
Have you seen many survivors?

29:49.001 --> 29:49.921
Yeah, a few.

29:51.681 --> 29:53.761
No one but ChloÃ© since then.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.030
You've seen <i>them</i> ?

29:57.070 --> 29:58.020
Yeah.

30:00.881 --> 30:03.281
Have you any idea why
they want to kill us?

30:07.161 --> 30:10.081
Maybe for the same reasons

30:11.201 --> 30:12.921
we kill each other.

30:15.201 --> 30:16.841
Maybe they enjoy it.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.161
They are not here yet, but...

30:26.001 --> 30:27.361
they will be coming.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.001
What makes you so sure?

30:31.281 --> 30:33.041
Because there are people here.

30:34.761 --> 30:36.481
They want to kill us all.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.600
I'd kill for pizza.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.870
- Don't they cook them on wood burning stoves?
- Aha.

30:58.930 --> 30:59.760
Do they still work?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.800
Oh, you want to open a pizza restaurant?

31:01.850 --> 31:02.760
That's a great idea.

31:02.841 --> 31:03.841
Shut up.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.280
Stop it, please.

31:05.561 --> 31:07.121
Did someone take my pistol?

31:21.121 --> 31:22.241
Where is Ash?

31:36.481 --> 31:38.081
You're going after him aren't you?

31:40.241 --> 31:41.481
Be careful.

32:29.850 --> 32:30.910
What is it?

32:31.210 --> 32:32.920
It's too quiet.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.320
Take cover!
Get out of here!

33:50.560 --> 33:52.720
Try to get some sleep.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.560
I will never abandon you again.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.970
I will never abandon you again.
I promise.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.639
Go to sleep.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.970
Sorry.

36:22.050 --> 36:24.460
Sorry. I didn't know you were sleeping.

36:27.340 --> 36:30.160
What are you doing?

36:30.280 --> 36:32.120
Checking you're okay.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.070
Where's Sacha?

36:35.390 --> 36:36.480
He's sleeping.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.360
Then let him sleep.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.570
Am I disturbing you?

36:48.360 --> 36:50.550
When they attacked...

36:51.320 --> 36:54.170
everyone who was outside fell down dead.

36:54.660 --> 36:55.980
Except him.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.660
Isn't that crazy?

37:00.840 --> 37:02.530
Any idea why?

37:07.480 --> 37:11.120
That Jonathan seems sympathetic to me.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.580
Just a bit of a...cotton ball.

37:15.380 --> 37:17.840
No idea, I barely know him.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.680
Is something going on between you?

37:26.070 --> 37:27.070
Are you <i>doing</i> it?

37:27.130 --> 37:28.360
He's married.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.980
That hasn't stopped you...

37:34.080 --> 37:36.110
I haven't seen you in ages.

37:37.090 --> 37:39.550
It's been such a long time.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.560
Your hair is nice.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.040
I like it.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.720
You can take this room.

37:54.890 --> 37:57.360
I'll sleep with Sacha.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.360
Sacha talked about you a lot.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.520
He really loves you.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.840
It was good to hang out with him.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.070
We never...

38:12.040 --> 38:13.290
discussed it.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.780
There's nothing to say.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.720
How long have you known?

38:19.760 --> 38:21.090
I'm tired.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.770
- I want to go to sleep. I want to sleep.
- For how long?

38:24.840 --> 38:25.910
ChloÃ©?

38:26.440 --> 38:28.320
When did you find out?

38:31.800 --> 38:34.760
As soon as I looked into his eyes.

38:39.030 --> 38:41.050
I wanted to give him up for adoption,

38:42.980 --> 38:44.720
but I couldn't.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.880
I don't know what you think happened...

38:48.900 --> 38:51.900
I know exactly what happened.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.860
We had sex.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.620
That's not true.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.810
I know it was wrong.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.730
You raped me!

39:03.130 --> 39:03.970
No!

39:04.950 --> 39:06.700
Think what you want.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.500
I know very well what you did to me.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.530
You're lying.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.320
Why would you lie?

39:25.400 --> 39:27.430
She knew what you did.
Mum knew.

39:27.430 --> 39:30.440
She knew what you did.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.440
When she looked at Sacha,
she saw you.

39:37.320 --> 39:38.240
That's why she made sure

39:38.260 --> 39:40.640
we never visited at the same time.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.640
So you and Sacha...
would never meet.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.200
Did you think that was a coincidence?

39:52.440 --> 39:54.240
When she looked at Sacha,

39:54.300 --> 39:56.200
she saw you!

39:56.320 --> 39:57.650
That's not true!

39:57.750 --> 39:58.840
She died knowing...

39:58.870 --> 40:01.700
her son had raped his sister.

40:01.850 --> 40:03.270
You always walked around

40:03.310 --> 40:04.800
in your underwear.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.960
You slept with all those boys....

40:08.980 --> 40:11.130
You wanted me to hear it!

40:11.800 --> 40:14.820
You did it all the time!

40:14.850 --> 40:16.020
You provoked me!

40:16.780 --> 40:19.630
What do you think that did to me, huh?

40:20.220 --> 40:22.720
You played games with me!

40:22.840 --> 40:24.530
You knew what you were doing!

40:26.540 --> 40:28.540
I love my son dearly.

40:30.910 --> 40:34.300
But it's horrible that he looks like you.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.160
Are you sure you want to protect him?

40:56.100 --> 40:58.310
Maybe you want something to happen to him?

41:01.030 --> 41:03.480
I can protect him...
I can protect you both.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.600
You take the bed...
I'm sleeping downstairs.

42:08.410 --> 42:10.380
Let's stop here for the night.

42:26.881 --> 42:27.881
Are you cold?

42:29.161 --> 42:30.521
Put on my jacket.

42:30.681 --> 42:31.681
No.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.401
Dan would have wanted us to live.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.310
He wouldn't want you to...

42:42.330 --> 42:43.200
I know, I know.

42:49.921 --> 42:51.921
I can't lose you as well.

42:57.681 --> 42:59.641
Wake me up when you get tired.

43:17.600 --> 43:18.700
Anything?

43:20.310 --> 43:21.570
Yanis and Lucas?

43:21.600 --> 43:23.310
They're dead.

43:29.710 --> 43:31.890
Is everything okay?
Are you hungry?

43:35.600 --> 43:36.060
No.

43:36.080 --> 43:39.000
Come on...eat something.

43:44.890 --> 43:47.250
Shhh, I know it hurts,

43:47.280 --> 43:48.860
but you have to be quiet.

46:39.001 --> 46:40.321
They've taken them.

46:43.401 --> 46:45.081
Why would they do that?
