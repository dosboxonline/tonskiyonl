00:11.750 --> 00:16.000

00:16.541 --> 00:18.125

00:18.833 --> 00:22.207
<i>how could a night so pivotal
in the lives of the Avengers,</i>

00:22.208 --> 00:25.500
<i>an event whose ramifications
would be felt for decades,</i>

00:26.083 --> 00:29.041
<i>how could it have gone so differently?</i>

00:33.375 --> 00:34.416
[The Watcher] <i>Time.</i>

00:37.875 --> 00:38.958
<i>Space.</i>

00:40.708 --> 00:41.750
<i>Reality.</i>

00:44.625 --> 00:46.291
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:51.166 --> 00:55.666
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

00:58.208 --> 01:01.625
<i>where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:04.416 --> 01:07.166
<i>creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.</i>

01:11.291 --> 01:12.625
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:14.875 --> 01:18.041
<i>I am your guide
through these vast new realities.</i>

01:19.458 --> 01:22.958
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:26.625 --> 01:28.250
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:30.875 --> 01:33.500
[Red Guardian]
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

01:34.416 --> 01:39.208
You want me to go undercover
as a Data Input Manager

01:39.708 --> 01:43.665
- in Ohio?
- Senior Data Input Manager. Eh?

01:43.666 --> 01:45.499
Middle management ain't too shabby.

01:45.500 --> 01:50.165
I am the Red Guardian.
I am Mother Russia's first super-soldier.

01:50.166 --> 01:54.165
You know my worth, my talent,
and yet you ask this of me?

01:54.166 --> 01:56.624
It's a pretty top-priority mission.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.749
Horseradish! I am no fool.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.457
I've heard the rumors.
Whispers in the halls.

02:02.458 --> 02:04.415
The Rook has sent new intel.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.207
I've never heard of this crook.

02:06.208 --> 02:07.957
Rook! It's a chess piece.

02:07.958 --> 02:11.415
Dreykov, don't play dumb with me
when I'm obviously smarter than you.

02:11.416 --> 02:14.540
I am speaking of the Rook,
the American sleeper agent,

02:14.541 --> 02:17.957
- has intel on a high-value target.
- [phone ringing]

02:17.958 --> 02:19.708
Uh, General Dreykov.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.749
Aah! <i>Da,</i> Karpov.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.374
Eh, there's a mission.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.499
I need you to defrost the...

02:26.500 --> 02:27.915
the Winter Soldier.

02:27.916 --> 02:32.165
The Winter Soldier?
That piece of HYDRA trash!

02:32.166 --> 02:35.249
- I appreciate it, Karpov.
- He's not even real Russian.

02:35.250 --> 02:39.790
Hey, hey, hey.
We're all a team here. Family.

02:39.791 --> 02:42.790
Don't be mad
that your brother has a different mission.

02:42.791 --> 02:43.999
Celebrate him, huh?

02:44.000 --> 02:48.082
Huh. Maybe it's time for the Red Guardian
to spread his wings.

02:48.083 --> 02:52.207
Go somewhere
that will appreciate my skills!

02:52.208 --> 02:54.582
Celebrate that, Dreykov!

02:54.583 --> 02:55.790
What you're going to do, huh?

02:55.791 --> 02:58.208
Put in an application at S.H.I.E.L.D.?
[scoffs]

02:58.791 --> 03:03.208
Then the Red Guardian
shall demonstrate his value once again.

03:03.916 --> 03:04.916
All right.

Well, I come for the pleasure
of doing business.

The mission is to steal the fancy serum.

04:26.875 --> 04:27.874
No witnesses.

04:27.875 --> 04:31.790
No murder. The Red Guardian
is Russia's greatest super-spy.

- Yes, witnesses.

- Ten.

- XZ-Ten.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.458
What happened to the nine?

05:51.958 --> 05:54.415
Was there a nine? I didn't get a nine.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.499

Negative. We secured one.

06:30.750 --> 06:31.749
Listen up.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.915
The name is Dr. Bill Foster. I'm the head
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Science Division

06:34.916 --> 06:36.999
which makes me the primary
on this investigation.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.499
Who was first on the scene?

06:38.500 --> 06:39.624
That would be me.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.957
- Talk to me, Ranger.
- Ranger Morales, sir.

06:41.958 --> 06:43.624
- Mm-hm.
- Howard and Maria Stark.

06:43.625 --> 06:46.665
Concussions, lacerations,
but expected to make a full recovery.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.499
- Great. What'd they see?
- Um, not much.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.332
The wife was unconscious.
The husband saw two men fighting.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.665
Best guess would have been
a carjacking gone wrong.

06:53.666 --> 06:54.999
"Best guess"?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.082
Ranger, in my world,
we don't get the luxury of guessing.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.957
Yes, but that trail
of blue Cookie Monster blood

07:00.958 --> 07:02.665
has me thinking it's a little worse

07:02.666 --> 07:04.749
than a couple of knuckleheads
out for a joyride.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.874
- Mm-hm.
- What's that gunk anyway?

07:06.875 --> 07:09.749
This gunk can change
the course of history.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.375
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.832
Agents and officers,

07:13.833 --> 07:17.874
shut down the airports, train stations,
and bus stations.

07:17.875 --> 07:21.874
I want a hard perimeter stretching
from here to Ohio.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.665
We are dealing with
genetically, biologically, physically,

07:25.666 --> 07:28.999
and mechanically enhanced super-soldiers.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.999
These men are trained
to infiltrate and destroy.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.915
They are capable of the unthinkable.

07:35.916 --> 07:38.749
To face them is to face death.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.457
A-ha!

07:40.458 --> 07:44.582
Foisting capitalist greed
onto the working man!

07:44.583 --> 07:46.165
I don't blame you, sister.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.874
You've been brainwashed
by the bourgeoisie pigs

07:48.875 --> 07:51.583
who force you
into paper hats and servitude!

07:52.125 --> 07:55.165
Sir. All I asked
was if you wanted fries with that.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.707
Demand a revolution!

07:57.708 --> 08:00.124
Seize the means of production!

08:00.125 --> 08:03.290
The nuggets of chicken
are yours for the taking!

08:03.291 --> 08:05.999
- Alexei--
- Your masters have you slinging burgers,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.124
but when, when, when do you get to eat?

08:10.125 --> 08:12.207
I'm a vegetarian, fart-knocker!

08:12.208 --> 08:15.165
Hah. Hey, Lucy, is it?
That's a pretty name.

08:15.166 --> 08:19.041
Listen, my friend's had a rough night.
Can we get a couple sixes and two Cokes?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.958
Sure. I'll throw in some extra fries.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.124
What in the pelmeni was that?

08:26.125 --> 08:28.124
Your idiocy triggered my deep cover mode.

08:28.125 --> 08:31.290
Well, knock it off, Captain Personality.
You're embarrassing us.

08:31.291 --> 08:32.833
You're going to get us caught.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.791
[Red Guardian] Mmm.

08:36.291 --> 08:37.290
Mwah!

08:37.291 --> 08:41.041
I was liberating her mind.
Breaking her mental shackles.

08:41.791 --> 08:42.833
It's what I do.

08:43.416 --> 08:45.249
That's it. The Rook.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.582
The secret legend who will flip
the US hegemony like a <i>Monopoly</i> board.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.749
The man who will unite the workers

has him in Last Vegas.

09:05.625 --> 09:06.707
It's Las Vegas.

09:06.708 --> 09:09.457
That's what I said.
It's very rude to correct my English.

09:09.458 --> 09:12.082
Obviously, they forgot
to program any manners into you.

Hm.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.375
I'll handle this one.

Relax, relax. The Red Guardian has this.

09:55.791 --> 09:58.207
Are you relaxing? It's very hard to tell.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.874
Uh, ah, how can I help you, officer?

10:06.875 --> 10:08.415
Just a routine check-in.

10:08.416 --> 10:10.332
Say, where are you fellas headed?

10:10.333 --> 10:12.582
[stuttering]

10:12.583 --> 10:16.207
- Sister's.
- Yes, to visit our sister.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.415
It's her birthday.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.833
You guys are brothers?

10:19.333 --> 10:21.207
What'd you get your sister
for her birthday?

10:21.208 --> 10:22.624
'Cause I cannot for the life of me

10:22.625 --> 10:24.415
figure out
what to get my wife for Christmas.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.624
- Sweater.
- Television.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.707
You got her a sweater and a television?

10:28.708 --> 10:31.291
Wow! That's very generous.

You should dance with your enemies.

No, no, don't shoot!

- Dance.
- Hey! Stop swerving!

Hey! This is federal property.

Come on, man.

Dance! Dance!

11:47.166 --> 11:48.165

- You know

11:48.166 --> 11:49.791
what Karl Marx said about machines?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.666
They make men lazy.

Stop! Stop! It's over.
Surrender yourselves.

Ah, impressive.

12:37.666 --> 12:39.749
I'm sorry, farmers!

12:39.750 --> 12:42.457
Although of all the animals kept
by this farmer,

12:42.458 --> 12:45.582
it is the worker
who is most brutally treated!

12:45.583 --> 12:48.708
Again with the manifesto?
You're more brainwashed than me.

12:51.166 --> 12:54.750
Whoa! Winter Fox. We've got a big problem.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.665
[Goliath] Nowhere to go, baby.
Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide.

12:59.666 --> 13:03.082
Why is everything so big in America?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.708
- [engine accelerating]
- [Red Guardian screams]

13:06.458 --> 13:09.082
- Sorry, chickens. Sorry, cows.
- [chickens clucking, cows mooing]

13:09.083 --> 13:10.166
[distant mooing]

13:22.666 --> 13:23.708
Take the wheel.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.707
Where are you? Where are... Yes!

13:27.708 --> 13:28.957
Mwah!

13:28.958 --> 13:30.833
We've got work to do.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.707
Technique!

13:36.708 --> 13:38.375
The bigger they are,

13:39.208 --> 13:42.208
the harder they fall.

13:44.875 --> 13:46.082
Ha-ha!

13:46.083 --> 13:49.499
This is a quality automobile,

13:49.500 --> 13:53.000
which is a credit
to the workers' union that built it.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.874
- Keep going?
- Why not?

13:59.875 --> 14:02.375
I have nowhere else to be today.

14:06.416 --> 14:07.415
They're not...

14:07.416 --> 14:11.749
Okay, these two are either the bravest
or dumbest men on the planet.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.083
Worse. Enhanced and dumb.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.000
[operatic chanting]

14:21.583 --> 14:24.125
[screaming]

14:25.291 --> 14:27.374
- [both gasp]
- [Winter Solider grunts]

14:27.375 --> 14:28.583
[gasps]

14:32.000 --> 14:33.999
[helicopter hovering]

14:34.000 --> 14:35.832
[dog barks distantly]

14:35.833 --> 14:37.457
[crickets chirping]

14:37.458 --> 14:38.541
[Morales] Found it!

14:40.083 --> 14:41.999
Hmm. You're still on the case, Ranger?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.874
The National Park Service
is a federal agency, sir.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.290
Besides, I once wrestled Bigfoot
with my bare hands.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.540
- What?
- Nah, it was just a mountain lion.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.874
But the point is,
these yahoos don't scare me.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.416
[chuckles softly] Uh-huh? I see you.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.499
- Is that a <i>Thomas Guide?</i>
- Mm.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.124
With a page missing.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.000
Looks like we're going to Vegas, baby.

15:04.583 --> 15:07.583
[siren wailing in distance]

15:08.666 --> 15:10.040
[Red Guardian] Hah.

15:10.041 --> 15:14.625
This... This will garner me
a commendation, maybe even a medal.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.207
Ah!

15:16.208 --> 15:18.790
You're hurt. Why didn't you say something?

15:18.791 --> 15:22.333
The Winter Soldier never complains,
only complies.

15:24.416 --> 15:27.208
Stop it.
You're scaring the kittens. Let me.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.541
[meows]

15:30.166 --> 15:31.165
You know, you're supposed

15:31.166 --> 15:34.249
to catch the bullets
with your metal arm. Hm?

15:34.250 --> 15:35.458
How'd that happen?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.499
How did you happen?

15:37.500 --> 15:40.832
I come from a family of nobodies.

15:40.833 --> 15:44.916
Good people but...
then I had the chance to become somebody.

15:45.458 --> 15:49.166
Now, I am Mother Russia's great protector,
her Red Guardian.

15:49.708 --> 15:52.791
Pretty good for a boy from nowhere, eh?

15:54.458 --> 15:57.500
I'm a nobody.
I can't even remember anything.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.374
[Red Guardian] Nothing?

15:59.375 --> 16:00.624
Not even my name.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.749
[Red Guardian] I don't believe that.

16:02.750 --> 16:06.415
Look at you.
You are strong man with big brain.

16:06.416 --> 16:07.749
- Close your eyes.
- No.

16:07.750 --> 16:08.832
- Close--
- No.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.500
Closey, close.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.415
- Okay, fine.
- Now, think. Think back.

16:15.416 --> 16:18.166
<i>What's the first thing you see?</i>

16:18.708 --> 16:20.041
[Winter Soldier] <i>I see...</i>

16:22.000 --> 16:23.083
<i>I see...</i>

16:32.083 --> 16:33.290
I see Coney Island.

16:33.291 --> 16:36.165
See! You are somebody.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.957
You are the great Coney Island hero.

16:38.958 --> 16:42.916
And the Red Guardian
is proud to fight next to you.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.749
- Thank you.
- I'm going to steal us a new ride.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.666
Maybe something nice.
Some heated seats, yeah?

16:53.666 --> 16:55.083
- [phone ringing]
- [sighs]

17:00.166 --> 17:01.499
Ready to comply.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.374
<i>Soldier, this is General Dreykov.</i>

17:04.375 --> 17:06.415
<i>Mission orders have changed.</i>

17:06.416 --> 17:10.832
<i>You're to dispose of
Agent Alexei Shostakov, the Red Guardian.</i>

17:10.833 --> 17:12.165
Repeat orders, sir?

17:12.166 --> 17:14.625
<i>Shostakov has become a liability.</i>

17:15.125 --> 17:18.290
<i>Put a bullet in his thick skull
and get back here.</i>

17:18.291 --> 17:19.375
<i>Do you copy?</i>

17:20.916 --> 17:25.833
<i>Do I need to remind you that
mission failure will not be tolerated?</i>

17:27.208 --> 17:28.291
No, sir.

17:35.916 --> 17:40.082
[sighs] All these lights!
Who's paying the electric bills?

17:40.083 --> 17:41.875
The worker, that is who.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.166
Maybe we should play some craps later.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.290
You know, to blend in?

17:46.291 --> 17:49.374
Yeah, but no all-you-can-eat buffets.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.916
You'll put them out of business.

17:52.416 --> 17:54.332
Ah! A smile, huh?

17:54.333 --> 17:55.791
[speaking Russian]

17:58.958 --> 18:00.832
[speaking English] Here we are. [pants]

18:00.833 --> 18:03.415
Shield, helmet. Um...

18:03.416 --> 18:04.499
[exhales] Okay.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.416
[inhales] Now, finally to meet the Rook.

18:09.958 --> 18:10.957
How do I look?

18:10.958 --> 18:13.250
You look good. Very Russian.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.000
May Lenin smile upon us.

18:17.416 --> 18:19.125
[The Rook] Come on in. It's open.

18:20.083 --> 18:23.166
Pop the cork, will ya?
I can shuck my own--

18:23.958 --> 18:26.707
Well, you're not room service.
What's going on?

18:26.708 --> 18:29.499
Comrade Rook, I am the Red Guardian, sir.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.457
This is my compatriot, the Winter Soldier.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.540
It is our honor to meet you.

18:35.541 --> 18:38.874
I thought he'd be taller.
Did you think that? Is that weird?

18:38.875 --> 18:40.582
Well, what are you?

18:40.583 --> 18:43.040
Why are you dressed like this?
Are you a...

18:43.041 --> 18:45.915
Is he gonna shoot you
out of a cannon later or...

18:45.916 --> 18:50.249
You are the nefarious Rook
who will bring Uncle Sam to his knees.

18:50.250 --> 18:53.458
You will ignite the revolution
that frees the proletariat.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.040
Wait, so you two are Rusky spies?

18:57.041 --> 18:59.124
What are you doing in my hotel room?

18:59.125 --> 19:02.999
Our mission was compromised.
We require transport back to Russia.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.749
Whoa, I am no Russian spy.
I am a hot-blooded American boy.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.999
You are the Rook!

19:10.000 --> 19:13.415
You strike fear
into the hearts and wallets--

19:13.416 --> 19:16.040
I feel like I'm speaking
a different language here.

19:16.041 --> 19:17.415
Okay, okay.

19:17.416 --> 19:21.874
Look, I traded the Russians some
information on Stark's hunky-dory serum.

19:21.875 --> 19:23.290
A little tit-for-tat.

19:23.291 --> 19:27.624
And in return, you two idiots
were supposed to kill the Starks!

19:27.625 --> 19:29.582
Now, I was supposed to be givin'

19:29.583 --> 19:32.207
a tear-filled eulogy
about the fool right now,

19:32.208 --> 19:34.749
while they scrape his name
off Stark Industries.

19:34.750 --> 19:38.999
But instead, Howard Stark's sitting
eatin' tapioca in a hospital,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.583
and I'm talking to you,
Stupid Siegfried and Angry Roy!

19:43.458 --> 19:44.458
What?

19:46.541 --> 19:47.541
You are...

19:48.916 --> 19:51.083
You are capitalist pig?

19:51.916 --> 19:54.458
Red Room work with capitalist pig?

19:55.958 --> 19:59.915
Red Guardian work for capitalist pig?

19:59.916 --> 20:02.374
Hey, listen, husky Rusky,

20:02.375 --> 20:05.249
capitalism is the only system

20:05.250 --> 20:10.624
that stands for a man's right to own
his work, his life, and his happiness.

20:10.625 --> 20:15.582
Any man who thinks money
is the root of all evil is obviously poor.

20:15.583 --> 20:19.249
Not a country on this planet
that doesn't run on greed.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.332
Tell me something.

20:20.333 --> 20:26.624
You think your bosses, your comrades
give two nickels about you? Hm?

20:26.625 --> 20:28.625
About what you want from life?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.790
No. They don't.

20:31.791 --> 20:34.540
[chuckles]
Well, you must be the funny one.

20:34.541 --> 20:37.332
It's... just you two, right?

20:37.333 --> 20:39.833
Only you know about this mission failure.

20:40.416 --> 20:42.041
It's not something you brag about.

20:46.791 --> 20:47.915
[grunts]

20:47.916 --> 20:49.666
[screams]

20:53.375 --> 20:54.624
Hm.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.250
I think I murdered that guy.

20:56.916 --> 20:59.166
- I'm sorry.
- He was not a nice man.

21:00.958 --> 21:05.415
He's right, though.
About the Red Room, Dreykov...

21:05.416 --> 21:07.541
Dreykov's a pig. All of them are.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.750
But not you. You are a good man.

21:11.666 --> 21:13.666
- [sighs]
- [sirens approaching]

21:17.958 --> 21:19.207
Come on. We need to go.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.291
[thuds, grunts]

21:21.041 --> 21:23.541
Red Room Task Force. [grunts]

21:25.458 --> 21:26.583
You animals.

21:29.583 --> 21:30.625
Should we take the stairs?

21:31.333 --> 21:32.374
Window will be faster.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.874
- Let's go.
- Scum!

21:33.875 --> 21:36.208
Ah-ha, adventure!

21:36.791 --> 21:39.999
The intrepids are calling!

21:40.000 --> 21:41.082
Ya!

21:41.083 --> 21:44.499
Opa! Opa! Ya! Ya!

21:44.500 --> 21:48.124
So, our Russians spare the Starks,
but not baldy?

21:48.125 --> 21:50.624
Something about this math isn't adding up.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.708
[distant screaming]

21:54.708 --> 21:57.457
- [people scream]
- [Red Guardian grunts]

21:57.458 --> 21:59.375
A-ha-ha!

22:00.375 --> 22:01.374
[sighs]

22:01.375 --> 22:03.041
Nice moves. Okay.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.957
[both panting]

22:06.958 --> 22:08.666
- [indistinct chatter]
- Whoa!

22:09.625 --> 22:13.333
Again with the murdering.
You were doing so well.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.582
[slot machines pinging]

22:15.583 --> 22:17.499
- Jackpot.
- [all exclaiming]

22:17.500 --> 22:18.832
Mine, that's mine.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.500
Oh, brilliant.

22:22.166 --> 22:25.624
- Uh?
- What? I'm not getting overtime for this.

22:25.625 --> 22:28.040
I have one last chip of my own.

22:28.041 --> 22:29.791
- [man] Hey!
- [woman] What are they doing?

22:30.791 --> 22:32.040
Hut, hut, hut.

22:32.041 --> 22:33.125
[pants]

22:34.375 --> 22:36.540
- [horns honking]
- [Red Guardian] Whoa!

22:36.541 --> 22:37.707
[Goliath] Where are you goin'?

22:37.708 --> 22:39.832
Oh! This guy again?

22:39.833 --> 22:41.415
[Goliath] You can't outrun me.

22:41.416 --> 22:43.625
- I thought we were done with the big guy.
- [siren wails]

22:45.208 --> 22:46.208
Hey!

22:46.791 --> 22:48.916
- [grunting]
- [tires screeching]

22:50.666 --> 22:51.666
[grunts]

22:53.666 --> 22:54.832
- Hey!
- [Goliath] Up you go.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.583
[groaning]

22:57.166 --> 22:58.250
[Goliath] Hey, little man.

22:59.833 --> 23:00.916
[screams]

23:03.291 --> 23:04.291
[sighs in exhaustion]

23:05.000 --> 23:07.166
[both groaning]

23:07.791 --> 23:09.916
Defeat the capitalist giant.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.416
Uh-oh!

23:19.958 --> 23:21.499
[car alarms blaring]

23:21.500 --> 23:22.749
- Technique!
- Technique!

23:22.750 --> 23:24.165
[Red Guardian laughs]

23:24.166 --> 23:26.416
That's how we do it in Moscow.

23:27.041 --> 23:28.041
Thank you.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.708
Ah. Not bad. Pretty smooth.

23:34.208 --> 23:36.415
Is that it? Are they gone?

23:36.416 --> 23:38.249
Not gone. Cornered.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.624
Get the choppers over here,

23:39.625 --> 23:42.207
and call Las Vegas SWAT
to secure the exits on that building.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.749
I don't want a rat to get in or out.

23:43.750 --> 23:44.874
Get the choppers over here.

23:44.875 --> 23:47.207
Call Las Vegas SWAT
to secure the exits on the building.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.291
I don't want a...

23:50.000 --> 23:51.291
[panting]

23:52.125 --> 23:54.332
We did it. I think we lost them--

23:54.333 --> 23:55.541
[gunfire]

24:01.291 --> 24:02.790
The Red Room just arrived.

24:02.791 --> 24:05.082
Karpov can flip my switch. I'll be gone.

24:05.083 --> 24:06.291
I won't remember this.

24:07.708 --> 24:08.707
[sighs]

24:08.708 --> 24:09.916
[phone ringing]

24:11.833 --> 24:12.915
Ready to comply?

24:12.916 --> 24:16.666
[Karpov] <i>You failed your mission, soldier.
Dreykov warned you what would happen.</i>

24:19.125 --> 24:20.290
Dreykov?

24:20.291 --> 24:22.165
Dreykov put out a kill order on you.

24:22.166 --> 24:23.832
Uh. Oh?

24:23.833 --> 24:26.040
You mean he told you to--

24:26.041 --> 24:28.040
Take this and run.
I'll buy you time to escape.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.165
No. No.

24:29.166 --> 24:32.499
They betray me, I betray them!

24:32.500 --> 24:36.666
The Red Room has enough soldiers.
We'll fight together.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
[speaking Russian]

24:48.125 --> 24:49.415
What is happening?
