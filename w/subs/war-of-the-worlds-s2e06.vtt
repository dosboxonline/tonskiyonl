23:14.320 --> 23:16.280
It's worth a look.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
Sophia?

23:20.720 --> 23:21.720
Sophia?

23:22.920 --> 23:24.200
Do you want to eat something?

23:24.280 --> 23:25.600
Yeah.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.320
The ripples in space
we detected at the observatory.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.400
I think they were
caused by a quantum event.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.840
It must have been huge.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.920
What's the guy saying in the videos?

23:50.960 --> 23:52.280
He's just found Bob.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.480
Who's Bob?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.520
It's a nickname
I gave the alien creature.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.600
It was injured.
He brought it back here to work on it.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.080
Has he said what happened
to his girlfriend?

24:05.440 --> 24:07.000
Not yet.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.600
You can see he tries to not think
about her. It's too sad for him.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.560
You should watch the videos?

24:19.800 --> 24:22.000
Why would I do that? I have
more important things to do right now.

24:22.080 --> 24:26.880
I don't know. Maybe so you can
take an interest in others for once?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.280
Just an idea.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.480
Mum says he's gonna be fine.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.440
Dad?

26:10.720 --> 26:11.800
What is it?

26:16.160 --> 26:18.080
(VOICE FALTERS)
They were gonna kill Tom.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.200
And I was gonna watch him die,

26:21.000 --> 26:22.960
and there was nothing
I could do to protect him.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.040
You stopped them.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.200
What about next time?

26:26.320 --> 26:28.200
And the time after that? I'm your dad.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.680
I'm... I'm supposed to keep you safe.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.280
I can't protect you.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.760
You were getting insulin.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.160
Tom got shot because of me.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.480
Em...

26:41.200 --> 26:43.200
And I don't want you to do it anymore.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.280
You know, when you were young...

26:55.520 --> 26:59.320
if anyone said anything, if they did
anything, if they picked on him,

27:01.760 --> 27:03.360
you were always there,

27:04.680 --> 27:05.880
straight in there.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.280
You didn't take any prisoners...

27:08.360 --> 27:09.600
I wasn't gonna get killed.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.680
But you would.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.720
You'd risk your life for him.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.240
Yeah.

27:22.960 --> 27:23.960
Yeah.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.800
So don't ask us not to do
the same for you.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.040
I was so worried.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.760
We thought you were dead.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.840
Some soldiers took me.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.440
They were keeping me prisoner.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.200
He was with them.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.160
Bill Ward. He was there.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.960
One of the soldiers was beating me.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.600
Bill Ward helped me escape.
He saved my life.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.480
You spent time with him?

28:32.080 --> 28:34.080
He's different
to how I thought he would be.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.040
What do you mean?

28:36.880 --> 28:38.480
ISLA: He lost his wife and son.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.520
He's in pain.

28:41.360 --> 28:43.080
He feels pain just like we do.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.400
ADINA: You should have killed him.
ISLA: I tried.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.160
But he escaped.
There was nothing I could do.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.880
The virus is in Emily.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.800
It's in her blood.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.160
She was with him?

28:59.240 --> 29:00.240
No.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.560
I think he was going somewhere
to meet her.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.200
Where?

29:04.680 --> 29:06.080
His old laboratory.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.880
He's going to release the virus.

What if you also continue
on the other path?

32:35.440 --> 32:40.240
I think the creature calculates
all the possible outcomes in an instant

and it holds them
in the timeless quantum world

32:43.360 --> 32:46.960

37:19.000 --> 37:21.080
I was trying to stop Bill experimenting
on you. I did it for you.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160

but when.

I don't know.

40:42.960 --> 40:46.200

we can keep looking for him.
