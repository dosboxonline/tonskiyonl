WEBVTT

02:16.052 --> 02:18.971
I'm just so happy
we're all in the same place.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.723
I mean, talking on the phone
is just not the same.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.392
You can't really make
new memories

02:23.393 --> 02:24.977
when you just have
dinner twice a year.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.353
I know. I don't even think

02:26.354 --> 02:28.690
I've seen Laurie
in like four years.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.732
- She seems great.
- Yeah.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.025
- Mm-hmm.
- She looks great.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.068
Mm-hmm.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.862
She's always had so much energy.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.782
I mean, she's always just been
such a hard charger.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.742
I love her. Hmm.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.911
- She's such a great girl.
- Mmm.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.330
- Great friend.
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.083
Sounded like
that divorce got pretty gnarly.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.918
- Yeah.
- That's gotta be hard.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.045
She had to pay him palimony, right?

02:52.046 --> 02:54.423
- So ridiculous. Why?
- To that loser?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.925
Can you imagine?
I mean, I'd be furious.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.846
After he freeloaded
off of her for years.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.265
And I guess the whole thing's
been, you know,

03:03.266 --> 03:04.933
really hard on Ellie,

03:04.934 --> 03:07.603
- which is so sad...
- Aw, no.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.771
...because she was such
an adorable little girl.

03:09.772 --> 03:13.193
My God. She was so cute.
I wanted to steal her.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.114
But I guess she's turned
into a real...

03:19.741 --> 03:20.992
Yeah.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.869
What?

03:24.245 --> 03:27.122
Apparently, she's been kicked
out of two schools.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.957
- No.
- She's like a hitter.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.503
- She's a bruiser.
- Oh, no.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.089
- She throws furniture.
- What?

03:36.090 --> 03:37.758
You have to wonder
about these people

03:37.759 --> 03:40.135
who insist on raising
their kids in New York.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.803
I mean, what are they thinking?

03:41.804 --> 03:44.474
Honestly. The kids can't play.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.975
There's no childhood.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.894
They're all, like,
sucking each other off

03:48.895 --> 03:50.437
at, like, eight years old.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.149
I am sure they're doing that
in Texas too, Kate.

03:54.692 --> 03:57.945
But, you know,
Laurie's work is there.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.072
She's always defined herself
by her work,

04:00.073 --> 04:03.159
so I guess it's good
she has that.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.080
What?

04:08.581 --> 04:09.998
Don't you remember
how she was talking

04:09.999 --> 04:12.085
about how she was gonna get
that big promotion?

04:12.877 --> 04:13.919
Was she?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.672
Yeah, they were gonna
make her partner.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.589
What are you saying?

04:17.590 --> 04:19.300
I'm saying
I don't think it happened.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.176
No?

04:21.177 --> 04:23.221
I think she's kind of stalled
out there.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.555
- Oh, no.
- I know.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.182
Laurie.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.979
I mean, you devote
your whole life to one firm?

04:32.605 --> 04:33.773
The world's brutal.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.820
No wonder she looks defeated.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.035
I thought you said
she looked great.

04:47.537 --> 04:51.165
Well... she does.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.168
But she also looks tired.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.211
- Don't you think?
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.715
- A little down?
- Might be the drinking.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.884
She did drink
like a whole bottle tonight.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.261
Mmm. More than that.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.514
Mmm.
I just love her so much.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.976
I do, too.
I just worry about her.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.270
Oh my God!

05:14.397 --> 05:17.190
Laurie!
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

05:18.860 --> 05:20.986
Sorry.
Oh my God.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.282
What are you do--
What is--

05:25.283 --> 05:27.701
- It's locked. It's locked.
- Oh!

05:27.702 --> 05:29.995
Oh my gosh. Did--

05:29.996 --> 05:32.164
- I... Did I lock it?
- What, did I scare you guys?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.082
- Yes, you scared us.
- I left my, um...

05:34.083 --> 05:36.294
I left my bag with my charger.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.589
We were just talking about you.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.590
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.093
How long it's been
since I've actually seen you.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.931
- Just... how great you look.
- Aw. Thank you.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.100
Yeah, and how excited I am
to get to be able to spend

05:52.101 --> 05:54.061
the whole week
with you all to myself.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.021
- Yeah.
- Well, you're gonna have

05:56.022 --> 05:57.814
- to share her with me.
- Oh, I know.

05:57.815 --> 05:58.940
Love you.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.734
You guys,
I can't even believe it.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.278
All right. Good night.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.738
I'll see you in the morning.
Love you.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.864
- Love you.
- Good night.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.449
Okay, do you need me
to walk you to...?

06:07.450 --> 06:08.575
- No, no.
- You got it?

06:08.576 --> 06:10.285
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

06:10.286 --> 06:12.621
Yes.
Okay.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.874
Maybe text me
when you get to your room.

06:17.043 --> 06:23.883
Oh my God.
That scared the shit out of me.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.637
I thought it was a monkey.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.173
Where the fuck am I?

08:37.058 --> 08:39.477
Okay, Thailand. Let's do this.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.138
Mm-hmm.

09:55.803 --> 09:59.514
Where is this goddamn coffee?
It's gotta be 15 minutes.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.349
Hey, excuse me,
we ordered coffee?

10:01.350 --> 10:02.642
Yes.
I get it right away.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.561
- Thanks.
Did you not get enough sleep?

10:04.562 --> 10:05.812
No.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.024
You should have taken
my Lorazepam.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.858
I slept like a corpse.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.861
Well, you know
I don't like taking drugs.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.362
You know, I'm like you, Dad.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.197
I don't like
taking drugs either.

10:16.198 --> 10:19.034
What are you talking about?
You take Adderall all day.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.869
So I can get shit done, yeah.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.038
Yeah, and steroids.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.706
No.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.041
- Dad, really?
- Hmm?

10:26.042 --> 10:27.667
- Come on.
- Piper.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.711
It's a call I cannot miss, okay?

10:29.712 --> 10:32.047
We come all the way here
for you and your thesis,

10:32.048 --> 10:34.758
so make some concessions
for the rest of us.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.136
Okay, but I didn't choose
to stay at this hotel.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.513
Well, we chose it
'cause it's your kind of thing.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.057
No, it's not.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.893
It's like a Disneyland
for rich bohemians from Malibu

10:44.894 --> 10:46.854
in their Lululemon yoga pants.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.065
- Um, sorry.
- Hey.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.150
Hi. I'm sorry.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.902
Um, this is really bothering me.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.321
Is your name Victoria?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.322
Mmm. Hmm?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.366
I saw you on the boat yesterday,
and I was like,

10:59.367 --> 11:02.619
"I've met her somewhere,"
and I think I've placed it.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.497
- Mmm.
- Do you know Claire Popovich?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.956
Mmm. Yes. I do.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.083
You and I

11:08.084 --> 11:10.752
were at a baby shower
in Austin together.

11:10.753 --> 11:14.172
Kate Bohr. Claire is one
of my great friends in Austin,

11:14.173 --> 11:16.175
and yeah, we spent
a weekend together!

11:16.717 --> 11:19.136
Hi.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.806
Yes.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.352
But do you remember meeting me?

11:28.729 --> 11:32.316
Yeah, your hair, your...
your hair was different, right?

11:33.818 --> 11:35.902
Well, maybe, maybe. Maybe.

11:35.903 --> 11:38.279
Um, these are my friends.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.823
This is Jaclyn and Laurie.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.991
- Hi.
- Hey. What's up?

11:41.992 --> 11:44.369
Gosh, it's such
a small world, isn't it?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.961
I just saw Claire
right before I left.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.255
If I talk to her,
I'll tell her you said hello.

12:05.516 --> 12:09.436
Okay, well,
you all enjoy your vacation.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.770
You too.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.814
- I'll leave you be.
Bye. Nice to meet you.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.108
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.615
I don't think she remembers you.

12:22.616 --> 12:27.288
Jaclyn, we spent
a whole weekend together.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.498
I mean, a whole weekend.

12:30.499 --> 12:34.002
Am I not memorable?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.630
I mean, who cares?
She seems a little crazy.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.843
Mom?

12:42.595 --> 12:45.013
- Why were you like that?
- Like what?

12:45.014 --> 12:48.349
- You were... kind of rude.
- No, I wasn't.

12:49.977 --> 12:53.313
- You were pretty standoffish,
at least.
- Well... Oh, please.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.857
What does she want from me?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.485
We met at a baby shower
ten years ago.

12:58.486 --> 13:02.739
I mean, so what?
Who cares?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.199
Well, I-- I think
she was just trying

13:04.200 --> 13:06.826
to be friendly and say hi.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.830
I'm on vacation with my family.
I don't know her.

13:12.541 --> 13:16.044
- Her friend is Jaclyn Lemon.
- Mmm. Who's that?

13:16.045 --> 13:18.087
- She's an actress.
- Mmm.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.382
- She's famous.
- Well, should I be impressed?

13:21.675 --> 13:23.885
Actresses
are all basically prostitutes.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.518
If they're lucky. Am I right?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.778
<i>- Sawatdee kha.</i>
- Hey, Mook!

13:41.779 --> 13:43.780
I just want
to confirm this morning

13:43.781 --> 13:46.616
we have a body scrub
and waxing for Miss Chelsea.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.076
Yep, amazing.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.662
And for Khun Rick,
a stress management session

13:50.663 --> 13:51.997
with Dr. Amrita.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.502
No. No, I d--
I didn't sign up for that.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.088
Yeah, I did. You need it.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.675
Well, I'm not going to do it.
So, cancel it.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.926
No, thank you. Okay?

14:04.927 --> 14:06.427
No, you can't cancel it.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.429
It's too late to cancel.
We'll have to pay for it anyway.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.431
Thank you.

14:10.432 --> 14:14.352
Well, Amrita is wonderful.
Everyone loves her.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.729
Yeah, they love her, Rick.
She's the best they have.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.439
I'll bet.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.942
He's really looking
forward to it.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.735
Okay. Well...
Well, enjoy your treatments

14:22.736 --> 14:24.113
- and see you later.
- Thanks.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.116
She's too sweet.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.617
Hey, I made a friend last night.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.910
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.162
When you were hiding from me.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.831
I wasn't hiding from you.

14:34.832 --> 14:38.084
Anyway, she's super cool.
We met at the bar.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.962
She lives in a house on top
of the hill with her boyfriend.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.049
He must be loaded.
She's invited us for dinner.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.843
And I said yes.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.554
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.723
You're going to have
loads in common with him.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.727
- Yeah, like what?
- You're both old.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.979
Nice.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.564
I mean, he's your age.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.733
Oh, and he's bald.
And you're going bald.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.903
I'm not going bald.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.655
Okay.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.328
The flowers.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.918
Yeah. We should have
more colorful flowers.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.341
- Oh.
- <i>Sawatdee khrap.</i>

15:26.342 --> 15:28.010
- Oh. Oh, hi.
- Mm-hmm.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.720
How did you sleep?

15:30.471 --> 15:31.512
- Great.
- Great. Yeah.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.555
Awesome.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.723
- Wonderful.
- Yeah, great.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.308
This morning,
I'm going to give you

15:35.309 --> 15:36.684
- your biomarker tests.
- Oh.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.853
And based on the results,
we will come up with protocols

15:38.854 --> 15:40.521
for each of you.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.650
- Uh-oh.
- Fantastic.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.985
I look forward to working
with you ladies.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.362
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.490
Thank you, Valentin. Phew!

15:52.618 --> 15:53.701
See you at the spa.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.204
Somebody's got to try that,

15:56.205 --> 15:58.665
and you're the only one
who's single. Laurie?

15:58.666 --> 15:59.750
No.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.213
Come on.
Laurie, he's cute.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.048
What?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.341
- Shut up!
- Gee, Laurie! That's it!

16:08.342 --> 16:09.884
That's the spirit!

16:09.885 --> 16:11.094
It's Cancun all over again.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.553
- No, no, no!
- Yes, it is.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.722
- No.
- It's Cancun. It's Cancun.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.403
<i>Sawatdee kha.</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:29.570
- Hey, hey.
- Hmm?

16:29.571 --> 16:31.739
Um, I have schedules

16:31.740 --> 16:34.367
for everyone based
on speaking with Mr. Ratliff

16:34.368 --> 16:36.285
and your own requests.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.831
- Oh, a sports massage. Nice.
- Oh, this looks great.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.082
Mr. Ratliff,
I didn't book you

16:41.083 --> 16:43.042
in anything because you said
that you just wanted

16:43.043 --> 16:44.336
to go to the gym. Is that...?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.754
Killing it, Pam. All right.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.298
Hey, guys.
Y'all have a great day.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.425
I'll see you later.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.843
- Thank you, darling.
- Have a lovely day.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.970
- See you, Dad.
- Bye.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.601
So, I thought today,
to begin our exchange,

17:00.602 --> 17:03.604
I could give you
my signature treatment,

17:03.605 --> 17:05.606
the warrior massage.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.983
I'm not going say no
to that.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.444
And then
maybe after lunch,

17:09.445 --> 17:11.530
you could give me
your signature treatment,

17:12.156 --> 17:13.239
and then, we discuss.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.116
But let's let our hands
do the talking first.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.284
Yes. Oh. The...

17:16.285 --> 17:19.663
- I like you, Pornchai.
- This way.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.545
Yeah, sometimes with massages,
I can get very stressed out,

17:27.546 --> 17:31.466
and I just feel
kind of claustrophobic.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.594
These help me to really relax.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.014
Hmm.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.483
Whoo!

17:49.109 --> 17:51.986
Inhale and reach up. Arms up.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.280
Exhale, opening up,
warrior 2, hips forwards,

17:54.281 --> 17:56.991
the right arm sends
the fingers out to the side.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.160
Long breath out.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.040
Inhale, left elbow, left knee.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.585
The right arm reaches over
and above your head.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.797
Exhale, both hands down
to the mat.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.507
Inhale to lift your chest.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.385
And exhale, step back,
downward-facing dog.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.637
<i>Hey.</i>

18:59.638 --> 19:02.056
Hey, it's me.
Sorry to call so late.

19:02.057 --> 19:05.059
Just checking in.
Did... did Kenny Nguyen call?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.727
<i>No, he still hasn't.</i>

19:06.728 --> 19:09.647
Really? Weaselly fucker.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.440
All right. Look,
he's got my cell,

19:11.441 --> 19:12.733
but if he calls
the office tomorrow,

19:12.734 --> 19:14.360
just put him through.
Doesn't matter what time

19:14.361 --> 19:17.071
it is here. I...
I really gotta talk to him.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.741
<i>Someone did call from
the</i> Washington Post, <i>though.</i>

19:20.742 --> 19:22.243
You mean
the <i>Wall Street Journal?</i>

19:22.244 --> 19:24.745
<i>No, no.
He said the</i> Washington Post.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.832
<i>He was being very pushy.
He said it was urgent.</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:29.584
<i>I'll send his info
with all your calls</i>

19:29.585 --> 19:30.960
<i>- in an email.</i>
- Well, did-- Did he s--

19:30.961 --> 19:33.671
Mr. Ratliff, I'm sorry,
but you gotta...

19:33.672 --> 19:35.381
Yeah, just put everything
in the email

19:35.382 --> 19:36.924
- and send it to me ASAP.
- <i>Will do.</i>

19:36.925 --> 19:38.593
Thanks.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.095
Are you sure you don't want
to be free of that for the week?

19:41.096 --> 19:43.514
I think, you know,
it could be quite a relief.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.434
I'm sure it would be a relief
if you stopped asking me.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.353
Okay. Say no more.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.607
So, how the current
is conducted tells us a lot

19:52.608 --> 19:54.317
about what's going on
in your body.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.944
- What, like shock treatment?
- No. Maybe just a little tickle.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.946
Okay.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.782
- Okay. Female.
- Hmm.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.118
And here's the milk soap.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.621
Mmm!

20:08.707 --> 20:10.876
Sea salt, to scrub the feet.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.422
Feels so good.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.804
Your numbers are very good.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.765
Markers could be of a woman
half your age.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.602
- Shut up. Really?
- Very good numbers.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.022
Please, tell me more.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.984
Okay.

20:45.869 --> 20:46.995
Whoa.

20:49.081 --> 20:53.668
In the Enneagram , I'm a nine.
I'm easygoing, peacemaker.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.379
But it also means
I'm quite complacent,

20:56.588 --> 20:59.675
which isn't always good.
Hey, you're probably a two.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.010
Yeah. Most healers are twos.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.918
Tell me. How do you feel today?

21:37.838 --> 21:38.880
I don't know.

21:41.216 --> 21:45.678
Your level of stress,
would you say out of ten,

21:45.679 --> 21:50.141
one being no stress at all,
ten extremely stressed?

21:50.142 --> 21:54.771
I'm going to say an eight.

21:55.647 --> 21:56.940
You're always at eight?

21:58.692 --> 22:01.945
Weed helps, but I don't want
to travel with it.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.447
You wouldn't happen to know
if there's a great

22:04.448 --> 22:05.824
weed shop nearby?

22:08.118 --> 22:10.161
Can you remember
a time in your life

22:10.162 --> 22:12.748
when you were totally free
of stress?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.507
As a child even.

22:24.259 --> 22:28.846
Well...
...my mother was a drug addict.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.891
She OD'd when I was ten, so...

22:36.271 --> 22:37.314
And your father?

22:39.649 --> 22:43.111
I never knew him.
He died before I was born.

22:45.655 --> 22:49.368
He was, um...
...murdered.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.498
Yeah, yeah.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.376
Real fun shit
to talk about, right?

23:03.298 --> 23:08.136
Meditation can bring relief...
to psychic pain.

23:09.471 --> 23:14.892
Meditation helps you see
that the identity you've created

23:14.893 --> 23:16.520
brings you suffering.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.439
I never had an identity.

23:22.609 --> 23:26.612
I don't need to detach.
I'm already nothing.

23:26.613 --> 23:30.075
Even nothing can be
an illusion you tell yourself.

23:31.326 --> 23:34.287
If nobody puts gas in the tank,
the tank is empty.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.750
That's not an illusion.
The car won't start.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.754
Nothing comes
from nothing, right?

23:56.893 --> 23:59.854
Hello.
I'm calling from Villa Four.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.730
And we all just
had our treatments.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.191
I had a wonderful massage
from Hans.

24:04.192 --> 24:08.988
And I was hoping we could order
some tea to the room

24:08.989 --> 24:13.534
and maybe some finger foods
like <i>"tom ka ti ta lay."</i>

24:14.953 --> 24:18.957
Um, maybe some
<i>"kai yang plu bai cha plu.</i>

24:20.292 --> 24:23.544
<i>Kai yang plu bai cha plu."</i>

24:23.545 --> 24:25.838
Saxon, what's with
the racket, honey?

24:25.839 --> 24:27.423
I'm on the phone.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.055
And finally,

24:35.056 --> 24:39.561
some <i>"pad Thai goong mae nam."</i>
Mmm, thank you.

24:41.021 --> 24:45.065
Saxon.
I just had a massage.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.193
You're setting me back.

24:47.194 --> 24:50.738
How can you be so hyper?
I thought you had one too.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.616
Yeah, but it kind of sucked.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.369
- Why? What was wrong with it?
- It had no happy ending.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.873
- Ugh!
- Gross.

25:00.874 --> 25:04.793
What? Aren't they all supposed
to be a little speshy-speshy?

25:04.794 --> 25:07.421
Ugh! Ah!

25:07.422 --> 25:08.673
Saxon, stop it!

25:10.926 --> 25:13.886
Lochy, how was deprivation tank?

25:13.887 --> 25:16.472
- It was quiet.
- Come on.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.807
What are you looking for?

25:18.808 --> 25:21.393
A blender
for my protein shakes, Mom.

25:21.394 --> 25:25.814
Just call the butler
and ask for one, honey.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.984
Hey, Lochy, we gotta get you
in on this stuff.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.027
Does it taste good?

25:30.028 --> 25:31.820
No, it tastes like crap.
Who cares?

25:31.821 --> 25:33.447
It's not about the taste.
It's about the pump.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.783
Come on. Hey, Dad!

25:35.784 --> 25:38.370
How's the gym?
Do they have a rowing machine?

25:40.288 --> 25:42.623
- Timothy?
- Yeah?

25:42.624 --> 25:46.835
- Is everything okay?
- No. No, it's not. I d--

25:46.836 --> 25:49.463
We're on the antipodal opposite
ends of the Earth

25:49.464 --> 25:52.299
from humanity here.
It's why nobody comes here.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.135
It's day here. It's night there.
It's night here. It's day there.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.971
I can't get anybody
on the phone.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.597
Who do you need
to get a hold of?

25:58.598 --> 26:00.767
I'm just saying
that the time difference

26:01.434 --> 26:03.937
is aggravating, you know?

26:06.189 --> 26:12.237
Poor guy. He works so hard.
He needs to calm his ass down.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.701
And this won't
be like your warrior massage.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.662
You won't be screaming out
in agony.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.833
But, I don't know,
people seem to like it.

26:25.959 --> 26:26.960
It's popular.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.300
So, how would you like me?

26:37.762 --> 26:41.515
Uh, on my back or on my stomach?

26:41.516 --> 26:43.350
On my stomach-- Not my stomach.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.352
My stomach, your s--
Your stomach.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.647
Okay.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.399
There you go.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.755
<i>Ja.</i>

27:38.615 --> 27:41.785
<i>Tam mai?</i>

28:31.126 --> 28:33.669
<i>Por, por, por, por.</i>

29:00.697 --> 29:01.865
So, how was the lady?

29:05.744 --> 29:08.747
She seemed really, like... wise.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.958
Why? 'Cause she's Indian?

29:13.251 --> 29:15.502
Yeah, Rick,
because she was Indian,

29:15.503 --> 29:17.046
and all Indians are wise.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.469
She made me sign up again,
but...

29:23.470 --> 29:25.305
...no fucking way
I'm gonna do that.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.890
Why not?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.769
Come on. It's good to talk
about things with a wise Indian.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.188
You think
you've got it all figured out?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.440
I don't think so.

29:36.357 --> 29:39.736
Hmm.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.070
God, you're so shut down.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.239
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.950
And you are an idiot.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.871
Hey, girl.

29:50.872 --> 29:51.998
Oh, hey.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.375
Hi, I'm Chloe.

29:55.376 --> 29:58.087
You must be Rick, right?
I've heard all about you.

29:58.713 --> 29:59.798
He's so jet-lagged.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.509
- And he has a migraine.
- Of course.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.970
We're going to hang out
so you can have a nap. Okay?

30:07.055 --> 30:08.097
Yeah.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.684
Okay, let's go.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.605
Love you.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.567
<i>Vamos a la playa, chica.</i>

30:22.654 --> 30:25.405
Laurie, how was
your session with Valentin?

30:25.406 --> 30:28.408
He said all my numbers
were really good. I was shocked.

30:28.409 --> 30:31.370
Yeah. Yeah, my hydration level
was one of the highest

30:31.371 --> 30:33.413
he's ever seen, which is cool.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.249
What was your water level,
Laurie?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.918
I'd have to look,
but he said that my fat mass

30:37.919 --> 30:40.212
was under 25 percent,
which I guess is pretty good.

30:40.213 --> 30:45.342
Mmm. That's really good.
Is that right?

30:45.343 --> 30:47.512
- That's what he said.
- Wow.

30:49.889 --> 30:50.973
You seem surprised.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.892
No! That was about
the same as mine.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.227
Oh.

30:55.228 --> 30:58.272
Yeah, he said I had the numbers
of someone half my age,

30:58.273 --> 31:00.440
which, I don't know,
immediately, I was like,

31:00.441 --> 31:02.234
can you please
put that in writing

31:02.235 --> 31:04.988
and send that to everyone
I've ever met in my entire life?

31:06.739 --> 31:09.284
He might say that to everybody.
He said the same thing to me.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.369
Did he?

31:12.370 --> 31:15.539
Well, he didn't say it to me.
He said my numbers are average,

31:15.540 --> 31:18.709
so I'm just... average, I guess.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.004
Look, I'm sure living in Austin,
the food is probably fattier.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.590
- Butter and... steak.
- No, no, no. There's--

31:24.591 --> 31:28.302
There's healthy food in Austin.
I mean, I eat mostly chicken.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.846
For protein, I eat chicken.

31:30.847 --> 31:34.975
I eat turkey. I like beans.
I used to hate beans,

31:34.976 --> 31:37.311
but now I eat a lot of beans.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.771
One day, I just decided to trick
my mind into liking beans,

31:39.772 --> 31:41.815
and now I do.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.026
You know,
I just have to eat healthy.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.736
You know, it's a part of my job.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.945
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.071
And if I weren't
neurotic enough,

31:48.072 --> 31:49.781
now I'm married to a guy
who's ten years younger,

31:49.782 --> 31:51.326
and he's always getting hit on.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.661
His body is crazy.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.457
Harrison and I are, like,
addicted to each other.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.001
- It's kind of a problem.
- Yeah.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.212
Well, you've only been married
for a year, so...

32:04.213 --> 32:06.965
Oh, I don't think
I'm ever gonna get tired of it.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.927
- Oh.
- Wow.

32:09.802 --> 32:10.803
Great.

32:11.387 --> 32:12.555
Yeah.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.024
Rick's quite cute
for an older guy.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.692
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.487
He's rude. Sorry.
Don't take it personally.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.072
Oh my God.
Don't even apologize.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.324
Gary's so rude.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.451
He was such a dick last night.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.787
This morning, I was like,
"You know what, Gary?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.290
Sorry isn't good enough.
I want the credit card."

32:43.294 --> 32:45.921
The store here
has some really cute stuff.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.632
- Do you want to come with me?
- Yeah.

32:48.758 --> 32:49.801
Hey, what's up?

32:50.927 --> 32:51.970
What's going on?

32:54.389 --> 32:57.224
God, he's such a douche.

32:57.225 --> 33:00.186
He was on the boat with us.
He's from a family of wankers.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.063
Oh, yeah?

33:03.690 --> 33:06.401
- Yeah.
- Cute.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.546
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.026
Did you meditate in the tank?

33:53.781 --> 33:55.033
I did try to pray.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.287
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:00.997 --> 34:01.998
How'd it go?

34:05.668 --> 34:07.879
I felt like
I was just talking to myself.

34:09.714 --> 34:10.757
Hmm.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.676
You never feel, like,
a presence or anything?

34:17.722 --> 34:18.723
I do.

34:19.515 --> 34:21.059
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.813
Don't you feel like
that could just be,
like, wishful thinking?

34:26.814 --> 34:29.274
Like, you want
to feel something, so you--

34:29.275 --> 34:30.401
It's real.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.629
Saxon says you've never had sex.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.763
Okay, and how would
he know that?

35:02.183 --> 35:03.476
He doesn't know what I do.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.188
Also, why would he say that?

35:08.189 --> 35:09.981
Like... like,
why would that even come up?

35:09.982 --> 35:11.483
Like, in what context?

35:11.484 --> 35:14.027
Well, he was just saying
it's like... It's weird

35:14.028 --> 35:15.779
because you're so hot,
but you've never had sex.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.825
It's like a...
like a compliment about you.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.663
Please don't bring it up.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.414
He shouldn't be talking
about me like that.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.166
It's not that bad.
It's not a big deal.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.710
Okay, well,
he should mind his own business.

35:32.588 --> 35:33.589
Freak.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.011
- Have you, though?
- Really?

35:40.805 --> 35:42.390
- It was just a question.
- Seriously?

35:44.350 --> 35:45.351
Ugh.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.216
Ooh, can I see
this snake choker thing?

36:18.217 --> 36:20.469
- Sure.
- Thank you. <i>Khop khun kha.</i>

36:23.222 --> 36:25.640
I'm going to try these on.
What do you think?

36:25.641 --> 36:26.766
- Yeah.
- It's nice, right?

36:26.767 --> 36:28.144
Mm-hmm.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.319
Hey, Tok.
<i>Wa nai, nong chai?</i>

36:37.320 --> 36:40.113
Hey, Valentin. <i>Sabai dee mai?</i>

36:40.114 --> 36:41.574
Yeah, you good?

36:46.871 --> 36:47.955
Gonna go see the fights.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.498
Hey.

36:50.499 --> 36:52.334
- You look like Buakaw.
- Buakaw?

36:52.335 --> 36:53.501
I like your moves, Tok.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.338
Oh, thank you.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.631
Uh--

36:59.467 --> 37:01.635
There's
a very big fight on Friday.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.012
One of my friends is fighting.

37:04.096 --> 37:05.348
I can get you a ticket.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.725
- Get me a ticket?
- Yeah.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.809
- Okay.
- Yeah?

37:09.810 --> 37:10.895
Let's go.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.663
Shh. Get back!

37:29.664 --> 37:33.166
- Oh my God.
- Quiet. Go. Open it.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.209
Open it!

37:34.210 --> 37:37.004
No, I can't.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.646
Quiet.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.109
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.237
Oh my God. What just happened?
Oh my God. What should we do?

38:02.238 --> 38:05.116
What the fuck was that?

38:20.881 --> 38:23.050
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

40:53.325 --> 40:54.492
<i>Ja.</i>

41:03.878 --> 41:06.588
But the one time something
exciting happens around here,

41:06.589 --> 41:08.173
I miss the whole thing.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.009
No, trust me.
You're lucky. I almost died.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.136
No, you didn't.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.512
Yes, I did.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.139
Oh, but we got
the room comped,

41:16.140 --> 41:17.600
didn't we, babes? That was cool.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.604
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you did a great job, babe.

41:38.329 --> 41:42.248
Khun Sritala, you will see,
she's incredible.

41:42.249 --> 41:45.710
She... She is really,
truly a legend.

41:45.711 --> 41:49.172
And... and she encourages us
all to make healthy choices

41:49.173 --> 41:52.342
and to develop
our artistic side.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.136
All the performers tonight
are staff.

41:54.762 --> 41:55.762
Really?

41:55.763 --> 41:57.263
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

41:57.264 --> 41:59.766
Even I have started
to write songs.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.351
I'm learning piano.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.603
Ooh! So what night are you going
to be performing? Hm?

42:03.604 --> 42:05.271
- Okay.
- Huh?

42:05.272 --> 42:07.023
- No. No. No.
- Yeah?

42:07.024 --> 42:08.274
- I can't. I can't.
- Come on.

42:08.275 --> 42:11.277
It would be, uh, crazy.
I w-- I wouldn't dare.

42:11.278 --> 42:13.488
- Come on, get up there.
- Do it!

42:13.489 --> 42:18.744
Uh, I... I... I'm the boss.
So, uh... Uh, maybe.

42:20.287 --> 42:21.413
Maybe one day.

42:32.049 --> 42:34.467
- Yes, thank you so much.
- May I take the plates, please?

42:34.468 --> 42:35.969
Yeah, yeah. We're all done.

42:35.970 --> 42:39.597
- You girls are gorgeous.
- Thank you.

42:39.598 --> 42:42.476
- Great skin.
- <i>Kha.</i>

42:45.896 --> 42:47.230
Excuse me. Thank you.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.400
<i>- Khop khun kha.</i>
- <i>Khop khun kha.</i>

42:54.238 --> 42:55.281
Dad, are they women?

42:57.866 --> 43:00.410
Ladyboys? Maybe.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.161
Well, you know what they say.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.496
Having sex in Thailand

43:03.497 --> 43:05.082
is like eating
a box of chocolates.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.043
You never know
which one's gonna have nuts.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.842
Exactly.

43:15.843 --> 43:19.304
- What? What?
- Oh, Piper.

43:19.305 --> 43:20.805
You know, it's getting old.

43:20.806 --> 43:23.516
Oh my God. What's your problem?

43:23.517 --> 43:25.894
For one,
stay out of my personal life.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.899
What are you even talking about?

43:32.443 --> 43:35.028
All right.
Just settle down, okay?

43:35.029 --> 43:37.697
Just try to get along.

43:37.698 --> 43:41.909
Because you need your family.
You do.

43:41.910 --> 43:44.622
Most people
don't have good values.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.874
They're scammers.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.878
You're all gorgeous,
and you come for money.

43:52.463 --> 43:56.425
So, you have
to be hypervigilant, okay?

43:57.176 --> 43:59.803
You're have to be on your guard.

44:08.437 --> 44:12.691
So, uh, you've been
living here for a whole year.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.402
Wow. What do you do?

44:16.570 --> 44:17.613
I'm retired.

44:18.947 --> 44:20.824
What did you do
before you retired?

44:22.868 --> 44:27.873
Uh... This and that.

44:30.292 --> 44:32.502
What about you? What do you do?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.672
Well, the same thing
that you do, Gary.

44:35.339 --> 44:38.716
This and that.

44:38.717 --> 44:41.345
You meet a lot of people here
who do this and that.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.764
Decent line of work.

44:44.890 --> 44:45.933
It can be.

44:47.810 --> 44:51.229
My brothers
used to terrorize me.

44:51.230 --> 44:54.982
You know, your Uncle Babe
would fly out of nowhere,

44:54.983 --> 44:58.903
pin me to the ground,
hock up a string of spit,

44:58.904 --> 45:01.280
dangle it between my eyes

45:01.281 --> 45:04.283
till he'd finally
suck it back up.

45:04.284 --> 45:06.119
Ew.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.414
I mean...

45:09.665 --> 45:11.541
I hated him for years,

45:11.542 --> 45:13.960
but of course now,
we're very close.

45:16.463 --> 45:17.964
Really, Tim?

45:17.965 --> 45:19.799
All right.
I'm gonna call you right back.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.052
Stay there, okay? Don't move.

45:22.636 --> 45:23.887
Oh, God.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.349
- Ugh.
- I gotta take this.

45:27.808 --> 45:28.892
Okay.

45:43.782 --> 45:46.160
So, what about the two of you?
Where'd you meet?

45:48.120 --> 45:50.580
Uh, in Dubai.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.666
Mm-hmm.
Through a matchmaking service.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.001
- Matchmaking service?
- Mm-hmm.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.253
Wow, really?

45:57.921 --> 45:59.255
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

45:59.256 --> 46:03.593
Yeah, I mean, we're different.
Different ages. I'm American.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.221
She's French. But we get along.

46:07.514 --> 46:08.557
What are you talking about?

46:09.308 --> 46:11.351
- What?
- I'm not French.

46:13.812 --> 46:14.812
What do you mean?

46:14.813 --> 46:17.190
I'm from Quebec.
It's not the same thing.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.650
You know, I-- I'm Canadian.

46:21.069 --> 46:23.322
French, French Canadian.
Whatever.

46:23.822 --> 46:25.448
Whatever?

46:25.449 --> 46:27.533
I mean, there's only an ocean
between the two countries,

46:27.534 --> 46:28.618
but whatever.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.661
Okay, why do you have
to be such a stickler

46:30.662 --> 46:32.371
about everything?
It's...

46:32.372 --> 46:34.207
- A stickler? Okay.
- French...

46:34.208 --> 46:36.375
I appreciate the geography
lesson, but, um...

46:36.376 --> 46:37.877
Well, clearly,
you needed it.

46:37.878 --> 46:39.379
- What are you t--
- Okay.

47:15.791 --> 47:17.250
- Wow.
- Is he in a loincloth?

47:17.251 --> 47:19.378
Uh-huh.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.556
So pretty.

49:09.696 --> 49:12.531
Why is the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
calling me, Kenny? Huh?

49:12.532 --> 49:14.743
<i>I don't care
about the fucking story!</i>

49:15.911 --> 49:16.994
Why not?

49:16.995 --> 49:20.456
<i>Because 20 agents
just raided my fucking office!</i>

49:20.457 --> 49:23.542
<i>- Fuck me, I'm done.</i>
- Oh, sh... Is... Is it-- Is...

49:23.543 --> 49:24.877
<i>I'm gonna fucking
kill myself.</i>

49:24.878 --> 49:26.045
Just tell me what happened.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.047
<i>I can't go
to fucking prison. God.</i>

49:28.048 --> 49:30.883
Can you-- Just--
<i>Fuck.</i>

49:30.884 --> 49:32.426
You know, you told me
this couldn't happen.

49:32.427 --> 49:35.012
Remember that?

49:35.013 --> 49:38.015
You fucking swore
that this could not happen.

49:38.016 --> 49:39.684
<i>I didn't think
some whistleblower bitch</i>

49:39.685 --> 49:42.229
<i>in my office was gonna
rat me out to the media.</i>

49:42.771 --> 49:44.563
<i>Fucking FBI!</i>

49:44.564 --> 49:46.816
<i>- Fuck! Fuck me!</i>
- All... all... all... all right.

49:46.817 --> 49:47.900
I just-- Kenny.

49:47.901 --> 49:49.235
<i>God, she did me so dirty.</i>

49:49.236 --> 49:51.529
What exactly do they know?

49:51.530 --> 49:53.948
<i>They have everything, Tim.</i>

49:53.949 --> 49:55.741
<i>- My accounts, my emails...</i>
- Yeah, but what--

49:55.742 --> 49:57.660
<i>- ...all the fucking documents.</i>
- What did you tell them?

49:57.661 --> 49:59.830
- What did you say, Kenny?
- <i>Nothing!</i>

50:01.081 --> 50:02.416
<i>I got a fucking lawyer.</i>

50:03.709 --> 50:05.835
<i>I should have never
gone to Brunei.</i>

50:05.836 --> 50:08.087
<i>I should've never taken
that position.</i>

50:08.088 --> 50:09.839
<i>Everybody was making a killing.</i>

50:09.840 --> 50:11.424
<i>- I figured, why not me?</i>
- Kenny, Kenny.

50:11.425 --> 50:14.135
Kenny! Will you shut
the fuck up for one second?

50:14.136 --> 50:17.723
Just tell me. Am I implicated?

50:20.267 --> 50:23.061
<i>Yes. For sure, Tim. Yes.</i>

50:24.604 --> 50:26.605
What d-- What... What--
What does that mean?

50:26.606 --> 50:29.859
Like-- S-- For-- Yes?
That's a definite yes?

50:29.860 --> 50:31.402
<i>That's why
I bought this burner,</i>

50:31.403 --> 50:32.695
<i>to call you.</i>

50:32.696 --> 50:35.156
<i>You need to get a good lawyer,
like, yesterday.</i>

50:35.157 --> 50:36.742
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

50:37.492 --> 50:39.118
You know,
this was a favor to you.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.703
Remember that?
I didn't want to do it.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.788
This is all you.
Now I'm wrapped up

50:42.789 --> 50:44.707
in some fucking
money laundering,

50:44.708 --> 50:47.752
bribery situation?

50:47.753 --> 50:49.086
And I only made
ten million dollars

50:49.087 --> 50:52.465
out of your stupid
fucking scheme. Fuck!

50:52.466 --> 50:55.593
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

50:55.594 --> 50:58.179
I swear to God, Kenny,
if you fuck me on this,

50:58.180 --> 51:01.974
I will... I will kill you.
I will fucking kill you.

51:01.975 --> 51:03.101
You hear me?

51:04.061 --> 51:05.311
<i>If it makes you feel
any better,</i>

51:05.312 --> 51:07.271
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill myself!</i>

51:07.272 --> 51:09.691
Good.
You do it, you piece of shit.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.663
Bravo!

51:24.664 --> 51:26.665
- You're a legend!
- You're incredible.

51:26.666 --> 51:28.751
You are a legend.
You are a legend.

51:28.752 --> 51:31.170
- So talented.
- Thank you.

51:31.171 --> 51:34.507
Well, once a performer
is always a performer.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.175
Do you agree?

51:36.176 --> 51:39.554
Yes! A hundred percent.
We know that.

51:41.348 --> 51:43.474
Well, I'm leaving
for Bangkok tomorrow.

51:43.475 --> 51:44.600
Oh, no!

51:44.601 --> 51:45.851
Yeah,
if you need anything,

51:45.852 --> 51:48.479
- please let me know.
- Oh, you live in Bangkok?

51:48.480 --> 51:51.982
Yeah, my husband's there.
We come back and forth.

51:51.983 --> 51:55.236
Mm-hmm.
He just got out of the hospital.

51:55.237 --> 51:57.071
- Oh.
- Oh, is he okay?

51:57.072 --> 51:59.990
Yeah.
Last week, he had a stroke.

51:59.991 --> 52:01.075
- Oh my God.
- What?

52:01.076 --> 52:02.618
- He's had a few.
- Oh, no.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.703
- He's a fighter.
- Mm-hmm.

52:04.704 --> 52:06.748
He would love to meet you.

52:17.300 --> 52:18.884
Awesome first day.
Oh.

52:18.885 --> 52:20.886
- Oh, it was the best first day.
- It was the best day.

52:20.887 --> 52:22.221
- She was amazing though.
- Love you.

52:22.222 --> 52:23.472
Totally amazing.

52:24.558 --> 52:25.724
- You're amazing.
- Oh my God.

52:25.725 --> 52:27.853
Oh my God.
Late night reading.

52:28.979 --> 52:32.231
- Look at this. <i>Glowing.</i> Sritala.
- Are you gonna...

52:32.232 --> 52:35.401
- Are you gonna do it?
- Got my reading.
Of course I'm going to do it.

52:35.402 --> 52:36.486
I love it.

52:38.071 --> 52:41.240
- Love you!
- Love you!
Give me the Cliffs Notes.

52:41.241 --> 52:43.117
- Ow, ow. Help me. Ow.
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

52:43.118 --> 52:44.869
You really should
never wear heels.

52:44.870 --> 52:46.662
I know. I know. I know.

52:46.663 --> 52:50.458
Oh, my gosh.
Are you okay?

53:10.645 --> 53:14.524
Oh my gosh. Ooh, it's hot.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.945
She's so funny.

53:19.946 --> 53:23.867
Right? What a character.
A real Thai diva.

53:25.410 --> 53:28.413
No. No, no. I meant Jaclyn...

53:32.167 --> 53:33.710
So competitive.

53:35.003 --> 53:38.964
Well, you know,
she's always been like that.

53:38.965 --> 53:40.591
Yeah, but you'd think
with all her success,

53:40.592 --> 53:41.885
she'd have mellowed out, though.

53:44.387 --> 53:45.430
Narcissist.

53:47.641 --> 53:48.683
A little bit.

53:51.603 --> 53:52.812
And the vanity.

53:54.314 --> 53:55.814
I know she has to maintain it.

53:55.815 --> 53:57.150
- It's her career...
- Mm-hmm.

53:58.526 --> 54:00.945
Did she sandblast her face
or something?

54:00.946 --> 54:05.659
- It's very waxy, right?
- It's more than just the basics.

54:07.994 --> 54:10.664
- She's still gorgeous.
- No, no, no, definitely.

54:11.998 --> 54:14.626
Gosh, she had the face
everyone wanted.

54:15.377 --> 54:16.419
I know.

54:18.672 --> 54:24.385
And then the whole thing
with the husband. Right? Yes.

54:24.386 --> 54:26.929
There's something
weird there, right?

54:26.930 --> 54:28.847
She goes on and on.
They're so in love.

54:28.848 --> 54:31.016
They're addicted to each other.

54:31.017 --> 54:33.560
But I mean, are they ever
even in the same city?

54:33.561 --> 54:35.522
I don't think
they ever see each other.

54:36.606 --> 54:38.316
See? That's what I'm saying.

54:40.568 --> 54:44.739
You know.
I think she's lonely.

54:46.032 --> 54:47.700
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.368
I think it's just a front.

54:49.369 --> 54:51.329
And you know
what they say about fronts?

54:52.163 --> 54:53.539
What?

54:53.540 --> 54:56.459
The bigger the front,
the bigger the back.

54:58.628 --> 54:59.629
Right.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.599
What?

55:54.851 --> 55:56.102
I almost died today.

55:58.188 --> 55:59.230
No, you didn't.

56:02.442 --> 56:03.443
Protect me.

56:04.694 --> 56:06.404
- Hold me.
- I am holding you.

56:10.700 --> 56:15.205
I liked our new friends, though.
Don't you? She's so pretty.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.374
She's a hooker.

56:18.792 --> 56:20.751
- No, she isn't.
- Yes, she is.

56:20.752 --> 56:23.963
They met through
a matchmaking service in Dubai.

56:25.673 --> 56:27.299
She's a hooker.

56:27.300 --> 56:31.513
She was a model in France.
She walked the Paris runways.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.430
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.

56:33.431 --> 56:34.973
Mmm.

56:34.974 --> 56:36.141
Anyway, I told you
we'd have loads

56:36.142 --> 56:37.310
in common with them.

56:38.395 --> 56:41.230
She's young and fun like me,

56:41.231 --> 56:43.525
and he's old
and grumpy like you.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.946
I'm just kidding.

56:52.575 --> 56:55.120
I'm glad that you made a friend.

56:59.791 --> 57:01.793
I may have to go to Bangkok
for a night or two.

57:04.838 --> 57:06.672
Bangkok? Why?

57:06.673 --> 57:08.216
I just got to deal
with something.

57:09.884 --> 57:12.178
But why now? We just got here.

57:14.013 --> 57:15.014
Don't worry about it.

57:21.312 --> 57:22.564
So mysterious.

57:28.903 --> 57:30.071
I'm not.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.117
Could you just get him
to call me, please?

58:16.659 --> 58:17.784
He has all my numbers.

58:17.785 --> 58:20.162
<i>And may I ask
the reason for the call, please?</i>

58:20.163 --> 58:23.665
Because I need a lawyer
immediately, like yesterday.

58:23.666 --> 58:25.042
<i>Of course.
I will have him call you</i>

58:25.043 --> 58:26.210
<i>as soon as he gets out
of the meeting.</i>

58:26.211 --> 58:28.462
- Okay.
- <i>Okay? Thank you.</i>

58:28.463 --> 58:29.881
Okay. Thank you.

58:33.301 --> 58:35.427
Anyway, so this one time
when, you know,

58:35.428 --> 58:37.596
when the tsunami
in Phuket happened,

58:37.597 --> 58:40.766
there was this little girl,
and she had just learned

58:40.767 --> 58:42.893
about tsunamis
in her geography class,

58:42.894 --> 58:46.897
and she starts, you know,
like, screaming to everyone,

58:46.898 --> 58:49.399
"Oh my God,
there's going to be a tsunami,
there's going to be a tsunami!"

58:49.400 --> 58:51.151
But, you know, no one wanted
to believe her, but...

58:51.152 --> 58:53.278
- Was she like...
They didn't listen to her.

58:53.279 --> 58:55.906
Yeah, well,
so her dad comes down...
