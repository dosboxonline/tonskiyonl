We're helpin' with the satellite.
Five minutes and out.

(INDISTINCT TALKING)

48:31.787 --> 48:35.582
Hey, uh, Eugenius.

48:35.666 --> 48:37.543
What about radiation, man?

48:37.626 --> 48:39.837
Uh, there's radiation
all around us.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.797
Certainly, there's
radiation from space,

48:41.880 --> 48:44.758
but every one of us is already
infected with some kinda nasty

48:44.842 --> 48:47.970
that changes us into epidermis
Epicureans at point of RIP.

48:48.053 --> 48:49.555
I mean, I don't understand
what you're talkin' about.

48:49.638 --> 48:53.892
I got it, man. No one's gettin'
superpowers today. I'm on it.

48:53.976 --> 48:55.727
Cuttin' into my 10 minutes.

48:57.521 --> 48:59.314
All right.

48:59.398 --> 49:03.777
-(MAN COUGHING)
-We made the right choice.

49:03.861 --> 49:05.571
Let's not push our luck.

49:05.654 --> 49:08.156
Well, maybe this
buys us some goodwill.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.950
This helps them, too.

49:10.033 --> 49:11.577
We helped our people.

49:11.660 --> 49:13.996
That's enough good for me for now.

49:16.164 --> 49:18.000
Where are Carol and Daryl?

49:29.720 --> 49:32.222
You still wanna run away together?

49:33.891 --> 49:35.017
Yeah.

49:36.643 --> 49:38.353
Tomorrow.

49:40.898 --> 49:43.942
Look, I need you to stay.

49:48.363 --> 49:49.865
Just think about it.

49:54.870 --> 49:57.748
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
punch holes in all them boats.
