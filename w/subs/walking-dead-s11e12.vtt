00:03.044 --> 00:05.255
<i>It was just
dumb luck, honestly.</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.803
<i>I found the radio parts
in a dumpster</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:13.221
<i>behind the municipal building.</i>

00:14.347 --> 00:16.516
<i>They'd never be left there,
for security reasons.</i>

00:16.975 --> 00:19.811
<i>So someone clearly thought
it was trash.</i>

00:21.938 --> 00:23.148
<i>But it wasn't trash.</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:25.900
<i>It just needed some love.</i>

00:32.490 --> 00:35.076
<i>I have the most
vivid memory of a ice cream shop</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:38.121
<i>with the most marvelous batch
of black raspberry ice cream.</i>

00:38.121 --> 00:41.875
The Inside Scoop?
I used to go there all the time.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.252
Hell, we might have been there
on the same day.

00:45.962 --> 00:48.339
<i>Well, knowing this, there is
a critical question needs answering.</i>

00:50.842 --> 00:51.885
What's that?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.929
<i>Cake, cone or waffle?</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:57.390
<i>That's how we started talking.</i>

00:58.308 --> 01:01.227
<i>And we talked about everything.</i>

01:02.395 --> 01:04.689
<i>Everything and nothing.</i>

01:04.939 --> 01:06.483
<i>I just can't help
but believe that this is</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:08.026
<i>a celestially-ordained
meet and greet.</i>

01:08.485 --> 01:10.236
No bean spillage here either.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.491
But, Eugene, my people
are uber cautious.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.035
And if we're close...

01:17.660 --> 01:19.788
<i>I never thought about leaving
this place before.</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:24.542
<i>Well, I did, but I never let myself
believe it was possible.</i>

01:25.126 --> 01:27.462
<i>Truth is, Stephanie,
I'd just very much like to meet you.</i>

01:28.379 --> 01:30.006
<i>But then my brother
got involved.</i>

01:31.382 --> 01:34.385
<i>And he was not happy.</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:35.512
God damn it.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.138
It's not what you think.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.431
Oh, yeah?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.018
You want to know what I did today?

01:42.102 --> 01:44.979
I investigated a massive
communications breach.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.317
Apparently someone,
on an unauthorized radio station,

01:49.317 --> 01:52.904
has been talking to a rogue
community outside of our walls.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.032
Well, then. Hornsby's all over it.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.953
Tell me it wasn't you.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.165
Please tell me that you are not
about to sneak out

02:04.249 --> 02:06.376
to meet some stranger
at a rail yard.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.419
<i>What could I say?</i>

02:08.503 --> 02:09.546
Max,

02:11.339 --> 02:12.590
it's dangerous.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.886
For everyone at the Commonwealth,
but especially for me and you.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.057
I gotta go.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.149
You better pray Hornsby
doesn't realize that was your voice.

02:30.316 --> 02:34.195
<i>I knew I had crossed a line.
And with Hornsby on the prowl,</i>

02:34.654 --> 02:37.115
<i>getting out to see you
was impossible.</i>

02:39.951 --> 02:41.828
<i>And then you turn up
with some other girl</i>

02:41.828 --> 02:43.371
<i>calling herself Stephanie.</i>

02:44.038 --> 02:45.874
<i>Using my words.</i>

02:45.874 --> 02:47.709
- Extra sprinkles, please.
- Got it.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.002
<i>My voice.</i>

02:57.886 --> 02:58.928
Excuse me.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.433
That wouldn't happen to be
rocky road there, would it?

03:20.491 --> 03:22.493
<i>You seemed so happy.</i>

03:24.412 --> 03:25.955
<i>So I kept my head down.</i>

03:27.916 --> 03:29.250
<i>I didn't know what else to do.</i>

03:34.005 --> 03:35.048
Thank you, Max.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.593
Can I get you anything else?

03:39.594 --> 03:41.346
Ice cream, tea?

03:41.638 --> 03:44.307
A day without my son acting like
a little asshole?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.060
I'll get you that ice cream.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.649
And, Max, have the bank cut off
Sebastian's line of credit.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.776
Maybe that will whip him into shape.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.696
I've got news.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.823
<i>Then Hornsby
came to see Pamela.</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:04.953
And he was buzzing about you
and Alexandria.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.746
- I never...
- What's he planning?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.043
I don't know.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.046
He's ambitious.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.174
Could mean anything.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.386
Could mean nothing,
just the rebuild.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.184
The big guy in the orange armor
who hates me?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.063
That's your brother?

04:33.189 --> 04:35.400
- Yes, but, Eugene...
- And you...

04:37.819 --> 04:38.903
You're Stephanie?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.447
No.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.241
I'm Max.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.702
There is no Stephanie.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.206
- Well, it was my mother's name...
- I'm sorry.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.374
- So...
- I'm sorry.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.318
This is a long way
from home, Lance.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.198
It is, but these communities are
perfect for what we're envisioning.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.657
What you're envisioning.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.911
I'm not convinced we need to
stretch our resources like this.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.663
Grow your empire further than
your power can extend

06:12.747 --> 06:13.831
and lose your empire.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.376
I don't think it's quite
that dramatic.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.879
Well, how's this for dramatic?
If this doesn't go well, we're out.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.548
These people are free to stay
with us permanently

06:22.632 --> 06:24.634
or they can go home and finish
their own repairs.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.804
There's enough to do at home
without having to worry about

06:27.804 --> 06:30.515
a couple of small communities
in another state.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.891
Give it a chance, Pamela.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.185
I really think
you might be surprised.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.236
Oh, God.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.658
Let's wrap it up, okay?
They're coming.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.369
Hey.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.745
 Keep it down.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.374
Hey, cover that window.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.231
Hello there. Welcome.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.651
Aaron.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.319
Pamela Milton.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.696
A pleasure.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.614
Care for the grand tour?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.908
- I would expect nothing less.
- Okay.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.498
Alexandria was a self-sustaining
ecological community.

07:37.832 --> 07:42.253
We have water, solar panels
and a crop system.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.713
Who was the engineer?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.214
I don't recall anyone from intake.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.424
No one, actually.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.343
We got the plans from the leader
of an allied community, Maggie Rhee.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.805
Some of our people studied
the blueprints and we built it.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.098
Fascinating.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.435
How do you keep a place like this
safe, with it being so isolated?

07:58.519 --> 08:01.230
It wasn't easy.
Fought a lot of fights.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.650
You were one of the leaders here?

08:05.860 --> 08:08.946
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
We all were.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.909
What'd you do before all this?

08:14.619 --> 08:15.661
Didn't matter.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.873
At least, not to us anyway.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.672
She looks just how I remember her.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.344
What, you knew her?

08:31.344 --> 08:36.474
Oh, we used to cross paths
quite a bit in philanthropy circles

08:36.474 --> 08:37.600
back in the day.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.520
But I had no interest in politics
at the time.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.856
She, however,
was born to run things.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.318
What was she like as a leader?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.072
She brought us in.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.325
We'd never met anybody
like that before.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.494
You admire her.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.621
Yeah, very much so.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.917
I mean, she built all this for us.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.295
Something worth fighting for.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.090
But it fell.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.300
Yeah, but we always
brought it right back.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.136
It fell more than once?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.596
<i>Code 1016. North wall.</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:17.223
- Yeah.
- We've got a breach.

09:17.932 --> 09:18.975
Stay here, ma'am.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.394
I got it.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.525
Shit.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.243
How did you lose Deanna?

09:39.203 --> 09:40.329
She was bitten.

09:41.831 --> 09:42.957
Did she turn?

09:44.584 --> 09:45.960
We had to put her down, yes.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.136
I think I've seen
enough here.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.478
Morning, Ezekiel. Jerry.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.064
And a good morning to you too, sir.

10:07.398 --> 10:11.277
Okay, let's get into it.
So, nothing but water morning of.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.946
No food, no solids.
We need you on an empty stomach.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.407
Sorry?

10:16.824 --> 10:18.492
Doc, we're just here
for a routine check-up.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.412
I was told this is
pre-op blood work.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.331
Make sure he's stable enough
for the surgery.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.708
- Surgery?
- To take out this tumor.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.710
Did no one tell you?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.715
I thought I was still on the list.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.885
Well, now you're at the top
of that list.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.388
You're lucky.
Some people wait years.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.559
- What about his bill?
- It's paid up.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.647
Well, however it came to pass,
I'm thrilled.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.274
We're going to take
good care of you, Ezekiel.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.527
Rest up. See you Friday at 9:00.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.875
This is so fricking awesome!

11:10.670 --> 11:11.796
What is it?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.175
How did this happen?

11:16.175 --> 11:18.052
Come on, boss. This is good news.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.471
Maybe it's coincidence,
maybe it's a clerical error.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.932
Maybe it's divine intervention,
but either way,

11:23.307 --> 11:24.892
don't you think you deserve
a little luck?

11:45.287 --> 11:46.330
Pamela.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.627
Pamela.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.879
Rachel's ready for you.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.389
You're blessed
to have this at your doorstep.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.724
We know.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.436
I heard how Oceanside came to be.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.605
About your battles with the Saviors
and the Whisperers.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.025
Says a lot about the strength
of your community.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.987
I'm excited to have you as partners
of the Commonwealth.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.157
Aaron mentioned there was
a trade provision

12:21.157 --> 12:22.700
that you'd like worked into
our agreement.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.120
Something wrong?

12:26.495 --> 12:27.621
We spoke to Maggie Rhee,

12:28.122 --> 12:30.541
the leader of Hilltop. She told us
she's not partnered with you all.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.003
We offered Hilltop
the same agreement

12:34.003 --> 12:36.338
as with Alexandria,
but Maggie declined.

12:37.965 --> 12:41.469
Alexandria has gone its own way
before, but Hilltop and Maggie

12:41.969 --> 12:43.387
have always been there for us.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.389
We renewed
our mutual protection pact

12:45.473 --> 12:46.599
and I'm gonna honor it.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.517
If Maggie decides to partner
with you,

12:48.976 --> 12:50.352
we will too, out of respect for her.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.355
Otherwise, Oceanside's a no.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.405
Question, what was
the point of bringing you along

13:01.489 --> 13:02.907
if you can't give me
any helpful intel

13:02.907 --> 13:04.700
in advance of shit
blowing up in our faces?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.995
Your people have been
fixing up Alexandria.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.580
It's not my fault the walker got in.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.209
You should have known
about Rachel and Hilltop.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.543
Because I'm a mind reader?

13:15.961 --> 13:18.005
How do you think this little detour
looks to Pamela?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.548
It looks like we're not prepared.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.383
It looks like you're not prepared.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.136
Lance, you know Pamela, all right.
I don't.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.139
You didn't anticipate this?
It's not my problem.

13:27.723 --> 13:30.476
Stop acting like Alexandria means
more to you than it does to me.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.229
Right now, you and I
want the same thing.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.856
Which means you and I
are in the same sinking boat.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.859
Is Maggie gonna make this
difficult for us?

13:42.571 --> 13:43.697
Fabulous.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.951
So you know,
this is all-or-nothing for Pamela.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.371
So, if Maggie says no
and Oceanside walks,

13:50.913 --> 13:52.581
Alexandria is cut off.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.586
Then we'll figure it out.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.588
Sure.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.049
'Cause it was going so well
before we stepped in.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.476
You all right?

14:58.564 --> 14:59.773
At ease.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.200
You must be Maggie.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.643
I already ate. Thanks.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.603
Well, I'll just leave it right here.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.022
There you go.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.274
It's good to see you guys.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.277
Maggie...

15:45.986 --> 15:47.196
Why do you trust these people?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.490
Who says we do?

15:50.532 --> 15:51.825
And when do I ever?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.411
Fair enough.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.081
It's good to see Alexandria
getting cleaned up, though.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.874
At least their word meant something.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.876
Yeah. There's, like,

16:01.877 --> 16:04.254
fifty thousand people living there.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.050
At least 49.9 seem like
decent enough folks.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.928
And it's not forever.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.097
You sure you don't want to come
with us?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.516
You don't have to do this alone.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.559
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.397
The forward unit picked up a swarm.
We have some extra rifles with us.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.773
So, while they're handling that,

16:22.773 --> 16:24.900
Governor Milton proposed
that we all go hunting.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.027
If you're up for that.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.217
We'll scare all the food away
stomping around like this.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.803
I'll go with Maggie and you boys
pair off.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.515
Don't need a minder
this time, General. We'll be fine.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.193
<i>How did things get so bad?</i>

17:10.487 --> 17:11.697
How do they ever?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.533
I've met so many communities
and I still can't figure out

17:14.533 --> 17:16.076
what makes some lucky

17:17.411 --> 17:19.705
and able to fight off the world
while others can't.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.832
I don't believe in luck.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.751
That's interesting.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.503
I'm sensing more of an opinion.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.506
I mean, luck is about opportunity.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.218
I don't know anybody who's had
more opportunity than you.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.014
Well, since we're being honest...

17:37.639 --> 17:39.058
Cards on the table, Maggie.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.976
I didn't want to come on this tour.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.939
I have thousands of people
under my care

17:46.023 --> 17:48.984
and that responsibility
keeps me up at night.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.653
That's the price of leadership.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.865
Everything costs something.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.493
For me, it's sleep.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.287
Do you know what I think about
at 3:00 a.m?

18:01.622 --> 18:04.124
Who can we trust?
How do we stay safe?

18:05.125 --> 18:07.169
Your communities are small
by our standards.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.339
I wasn't sure the risk of going back
and forth would be worth it.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.673
Then why are you here?

18:12.424 --> 18:14.259
The right allies make us stronger.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.429
This world belongs to us,
not the dead.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.224
Meeting all of you,
hearing all your stories,

18:20.891 --> 18:22.559
it's confirmed
what I've always believed.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.605
There's a natural order to things
that has vanished.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.775
And that order needs to be restored.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.236
It provides a future for our kids.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.197
Fifteen million little city-states

18:35.197 --> 18:37.074
fighting each other for power
and resources

18:37.199 --> 18:38.367
is never going
to be able to provide

18:38.367 --> 18:39.535
that kind of stability.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.163
I am offering you the same thing

18:43.247 --> 18:46.083
your mutual protection pact
with Oceanside did.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.460
Someone who has your back.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.073
Yeah.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.704
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.039
I just thought I'd see
how you were doing.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.751
I'm cooking, actually.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.171
Uh...

19:33.088 --> 19:34.298
You hungry?

19:34.464 --> 19:37.718
- Nabila and Jerry left me a buffet.
- Okay.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.596
- It's crispy.
- Yeah. Why not?

19:41.305 --> 19:42.598
Here.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.690
Jerry said you had a check-up today.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.734
Anything come up?

19:54.776 --> 19:56.069
It's a funny thing.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.363
What?

19:58.447 --> 20:00.490
Tomi said I was scheduled
for surgery.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.784
- They bumped me up in the line.
- Oh!

20:04.328 --> 20:07.539
That's good. That's great.
That's great.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.879
- Right?
- Wait.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.674
Did you...

20:17.883 --> 20:19.092
What did you do?

20:19.801 --> 20:21.011
I didn't...

20:23.305 --> 20:24.848
My debt was wiped out.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.019
Hornsby owed me a favor.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.732
It's cheating!

20:35.108 --> 20:36.485
Why would you do that?

20:36.652 --> 20:39.321
- Because I don't want you to die.
- Carol!

20:41.448 --> 20:43.492
Those lines are a lie.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.078
Do you think Pamela Milton
would think twice

20:46.078 --> 20:48.747
before doing the same thing
for her shitty son?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.501
Have you been inside
that hospital, Carol?

20:55.170 --> 20:57.339
Because if you had been,
you'd see all those people.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.008
Suffering.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.469
Same as me.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.347
Waiting for treatment.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.683
Same as me.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.645
You're supposed to just die
because the system is broken?

21:13.522 --> 21:17.818
Lesser men have been given more
and done nothing with it.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.488
You are not a lesser man.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.995
I think that's called
an autocracy.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.038
No, it's not.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.707
Liberties haven't gone anywhere.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.334
You're the leader at Hilltop.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.919
You make the decisions.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.213
You consider yourself an autocrat?

21:38.797 --> 21:41.133
I lead the way I was taught

21:41.550 --> 21:43.468
by Deanna and Georgie.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.680
The communities that we built
are fair.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.598
The Commonwealth is fair.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.727
Yeah, but you drive a nicer car
and live in a nicer house

21:51.727 --> 21:53.020
than everybody else.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.647
I have more responsibilities
than the average worker.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.733
A leader has to give her people
something to look up to.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.402
All right. Well, I want people
to look up to what I've done.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.863
And what I do,
not what I have that they don't.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.534
Behind you.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.162
You want it?

22:10.704 --> 22:11.913
Or shall I?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.000
Well, I was thinking about
going after the one behind you.

22:53.872 --> 22:54.915
Hey.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.505
Hey, come on now.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.721
- You okay?
- I'm great.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.015
How are you?

23:13.183 --> 23:15.435
- You've got a great poker face.
- Thank you.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.940
How's the new job going?

23:21.108 --> 23:23.944
You know. It's a lot.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.030
Do you regret coming here?

23:27.656 --> 23:28.907
Do you?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.245
So, you like it here?

23:34.204 --> 23:35.664
We all get to be together.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.542
Everyone's safe.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.627
So, it works for now.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.717
Going with the flow.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.762
Didn't think I'd end up basically
a cop.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.474
But I'm pretty good at it, so...

23:56.560 --> 23:58.854
You're pretty damn good
at everything you do, Rosita.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.899
Thanks, Eugene.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.570
I do miss home, though.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.864
Yeah.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.615
I miss going outside the walls.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.784
I miss the freedom
that we used to have.

24:16.413 --> 24:17.622
But it'll come.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.084
When Alexandria
is fixed back up again.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.962
When people have choices
and that's good, you know.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.388
You're excited about the future?

24:35.223 --> 24:36.516
Yeah, I guess I am.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.772
Eugene, what is it? Spill.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.697
I was thinking about
when we first met.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.991
And how I was lying to you.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.871
About who I was,
about Washington, D.C. and...

24:59.831 --> 25:01.416
It was a long time ago, Eugene.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.923
And we found our home,
so going with the flow works for me.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.846
Eugene, what is it?
Get it out. You'll feel better.

25:21.686 --> 25:22.896
Stephanie...

25:26.483 --> 25:27.692
isn't missing.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.490
I saw her.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.408
She just...

25:42.624 --> 25:44.834
broke up with me.
She broke up with me.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.837
Eugene, I'm so sorry.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.693
She wasn't who I thought she was.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.736
Screw her.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.406
You can do so much better.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.951
And you're gonna find your person.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.787
She's out there. I promise.

26:39.723 --> 26:40.932
Hey.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.517
They meant everything they said.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.728
All the troopers that came back
with us,

26:44.728 --> 26:47.147
they're working on reinforcing
the water tower right now.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.274
You went hunting with them?

26:49.441 --> 26:52.569
- Yeah, it's not much, but it's...
- More than we've had in weeks.

26:52.819 --> 26:53.862
Yeah.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.406
- We'll get dinner started.
- All right. Thanks.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.199
Is everyone okay?

26:58.533 --> 27:00.619
Yeah, yeah. Everyone seems relieved.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.330
I'm hoping this means we can
actually get some sleep tonight.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.417
- Daryl. Hey.
- Hi.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.294
Was wondering when you'd come back.

27:09.753 --> 27:10.962
- Hey.
- How you holding up?

27:11.838 --> 27:15.133
It's okay. I don't know.
We're doing our best.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.760
- Yeah.
- I just feel like

27:16.760 --> 27:20.263
maybe some things just
can't be fixed, you know?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.475
Just feels kind of
pointless sometimes.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.269
- I hear you.
- How do you know when?

27:26.853 --> 27:28.104
When what?

27:29.606 --> 27:30.899
When it's time to walk away.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.485
Is that what you want to do?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.278
Hey, Maggie.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.281
Is it okay if we hand out
some supplies?

27:38.531 --> 27:39.783
We have more than enough.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.409
Food, fuel.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.580
Sure. Thank you.

27:46.122 --> 27:49.000
Great. We're on it.
You two, come with me.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.797
Hey, Daryl, look what I got.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.256
Oh, my God.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.342
Hey, we're gonna pass out some food.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.927
- You want to help us?
- Yeah.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.388
You take the big one.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.016
- Give this to Elijah.
- Okay.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.603
It must be hard
to be a kid out here.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.563
He grew up on the road.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.649
He's a different kind of kid.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.112
Your friend, she like
torturing herself out here?

28:20.615 --> 28:23.284
This place used to be
really special, different.

28:23.868 --> 28:27.122
It's going through hard times now,
but it'll be back up and running.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.540
Just watch.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.419
I guess not all places
are as lucky as Alexandria.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.505
Not all places are as lucky
as Commonwealth.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.719
Are you coming around?

28:42.595 --> 28:43.888
I wouldn't go that far.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.100
But you guys have
done good stuff for us.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.644
So, I don't know.
I'll give you that.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.605
Commonwealth ain't perfect, though.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.233
What? You think?

28:56.192 --> 28:57.694
Just don't get too comfortable.

28:59.487 --> 29:00.947
The only reason you're out
of your armor is because

29:00.947 --> 29:02.949
someone thought it would be good
for appearances.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.285
You've got your role to play.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.328
I got mine.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.007
I'll be here when you wake up.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.927
Pizza, ice cream, the works.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.556
No...

29:27.932 --> 29:29.309
No pineapple.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.436
I'm serious, Jerry.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.606
Pineapple on pizza makes no sense.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.274
Pizza?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.985
You're not eating anything
but Jell-O for a while, hotshot.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.297
Nervous twitch?

30:01.007 --> 30:02.300
Lucky coin.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.427
I had a lucky rabbit's foot once.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.265
My dog brought it home with
the rabbit still attached to it.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.768
My old man gave this to me.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.854
When I was a kid,
I thought it was made of gold.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.942
Turns out it's just gold plated.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.361
Inside, same as a lowly nickel.

30:25.615 --> 30:26.825
Have you decided yet?

30:32.163 --> 30:33.915
What do you get out of all this?

30:37.377 --> 30:38.586
Come on, Maggie.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.549
Let's not pretend the obvious
isn't staring us in the face.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.968
You're in over your head.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.471
You don't know me very well.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.975
I know you're smart enough to know
a good offer when you hear it.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.689
And I'm smart enough to know
I've just pissed you off.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.610
You haven't answered my question.

31:06.155 --> 31:07.407
All right, I'll bite.

31:08.908 --> 31:13.204
The first time I went to Alexandria,
I could see it, the potential.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.416
Maggie, do you really believe
that Hilltop,

31:16.416 --> 31:19.961
as it currently stands,
is the best you'll ever have?

31:20.587 --> 31:23.798
Or Alexandria? Or even Oceanside?

31:25.049 --> 31:26.342
Look around.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.513
We can have so much more.

31:31.973 --> 31:35.560
Imagine being able
to pick Hershel up

31:35.560 --> 31:37.228
from a concert at the Commonwealth.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.773
Take him to a doctor's appointment
in Alexandria.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.777
And then jump in a boat
at Oceanside,

31:45.403 --> 31:46.946
traveling up the coast.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.451
And what's up that coast?

31:52.660 --> 31:53.870
Another port town?

31:54.370 --> 31:55.622
Another school?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.166
How about a university?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.795
Have you ever imagined being able
to drop your son off

32:02.879 --> 32:04.631
for his freshman year at college?

32:06.758 --> 32:08.134
I tried to build it.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.179
Of course you did.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.265
Because you and I see things
the same way.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.602
Imagine the world you want to build.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.148
Hold it in your mind.

32:23.733 --> 32:27.946
Now, picture the power
of 50,000 Commonwealth workers

32:27.946 --> 32:30.490
helping to make that vision
a reality.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.659
Think what you could
accomplish then.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.914
Swarm incoming.

32:56.766 --> 32:57.809
This way.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.446
Fire!

34:10.256 --> 34:14.510
Imagine not having to deal with this
every time that alarm goes off.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.263
Yeah, we could keep building.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.099
No more starts and stops.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.269
I know there's
a lot to consider, but...

34:25.563 --> 34:27.023
I mean, look around.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.733
We need this.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.152
I know.

34:33.863 --> 34:36.074
Formation!

34:37.200 --> 34:38.326
Let's go!

34:51.506 --> 34:52.882
You take the west side.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.342
You take the east side
and you take the...

34:54.342 --> 34:56.552
- Dixon, fall in.
- Hold up.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.975
Hey.

35:04.852 --> 35:08.022
Remember they're always watching.
Got me?

35:08.356 --> 35:09.982
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.944
Left face. Forward march!

35:34.340 --> 35:36.175
- Never a dull moment here, is there?
- Mmm.

35:36.801 --> 35:37.844
We try.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.137
Everyone okay?

35:39.387 --> 35:43.516
Yeah, no injuries, all limbs intact.
I'd call that a good day.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.604
But the Hilltop is going
to pass on your offer.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.650
Can I ask why?

35:53.776 --> 35:54.986
Because, like you said,

35:55.945 --> 35:57.405
everything costs something.

36:19.385 --> 36:21.179
No, please don't shut the door.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.937
Found some raspberry goodness
of the Inside Scoop variety.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.482
It's not exactly
black raspberry, but...

36:36.986 --> 36:38.321
Please, it's very cold.

37:00.551 --> 37:01.928
I'm so sorry, Max,

37:02.553 --> 37:04.055
for my ungentlemanlike behavior.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.849
For running away,
for not listening.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.478
I was bruised and confused.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.521
- You were pretty damn rude.
- I was.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.274
Indeed.

37:16.525 --> 37:18.444
I let Hornsby get
inside my head,

37:19.278 --> 37:21.572
and it was an infiltration
of the most epic proportions.

37:21.656 --> 37:22.865
He is a snake.

37:23.449 --> 37:24.742
Like a worm.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.578
I let an imposter into my heart

37:28.454 --> 37:29.497
and my home.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.040
I let her read my manuscript.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.416
Manuscript?

37:33.167 --> 37:34.252
I...

37:35.044 --> 37:36.254
I'm writing a novel.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.549
Was a sepulcher involved?

37:43.052 --> 37:44.095
Obviously.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.599
Did it take place in
the Carpathian Mountains?

37:48.683 --> 37:50.601
- Carpathian Mountains, yes.
- You let her read it?

37:50.685 --> 37:55.189
- I thought she was you.
- I know but, Eugene, how?

37:56.190 --> 37:57.817
After all that time
we spent together,

37:57.817 --> 37:59.610
everything we told each other.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.280
How could you not know
it wasn't me?

38:03.698 --> 38:04.824
I don't know.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.035
I guess...

38:09.245 --> 38:12.456
I figured out a long time ago
that I'm not like most folks.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.084
I got used to rejection PDQ.

38:15.084 --> 38:18.713
Didn't even realize it was rejection
some of the times, but...

38:20.172 --> 38:22.341
Well, suffice it to say,
it happened a fair amount.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.178
So, there was a part of me
that always wondered

38:26.262 --> 38:27.888
if our connection
was all in my head.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.226
But when I got here and she didn't

38:35.271 --> 38:36.355
push me away.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.444
I just so badly wanted this
to be real.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.114
And subtle cues escape me sometimes.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.828
Anyway, I never meant
to hurt you, Max.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.166
But my intent does not excuse
my impact.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.462
How can I make this up to you?
Will you allow me to try?

39:05.801 --> 39:07.053
I don't know.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.402
Can I read your novel?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.909
Well, as ill fortune would have it,

39:30.201 --> 39:33.788
you came upon me whilst I was
burning the only physical copy.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.374
However, I have committed
much of the text to memory.

39:37.249 --> 39:38.459
What was the concept?

39:40.086 --> 39:43.589
A gumshoe, by the name of
Steph Portman, is caught up

39:43.589 --> 39:45.257
in a rollicking international caper,

39:45.341 --> 39:48.719
trying to avert nuclear disaster
and navigate the intricacies

39:48.803 --> 39:50.554
of the legal bureaucracies
back at home.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.307
You didn't make the
district attorney corrupt, did you?

39:53.391 --> 39:54.809
Certainly not.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.352
That would have surprised
exactly no one.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.315
I did, however, give him
an unsavory twin brother.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.525
Hmm.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.568
Evil twin. Nice.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.112
Yeah, I thought so.

40:06.779 --> 40:10.950
You should make the twin
a scientist.

40:11.867 --> 40:14.245
Ramp up the stakes
on the nuclear threat.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.456
That is exactly what I did.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.882
What?

40:29.718 --> 40:31.762
It just felt like old times.

40:37.309 --> 40:38.978
Here. I got something for you.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.064
It's from Judith.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.942
She says in case you're making
Hershel eat more horse meat.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.068
Oh, God.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.989
- It was good to see you.
- Yeah.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.741
You be careful.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.785
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.704
Same for you.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.417
Dianne?

41:02.543 --> 41:03.794
I'm leaving, Maggie.

41:04.336 --> 41:05.880
Some of the others are coming
with me

41:06.589 --> 41:07.882
and you should too.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.178
You need to be careful
who you trust.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.889
You know that better than anybody.

41:16.056 --> 41:18.142
You also have to know
when to ask for help.

41:19.518 --> 41:22.563
It's harder than it has ever been
and it doesn't have to be.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.398
I respect the hell out of you.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.278
But I can't do this anymore.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.824
I'm sorry.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.306
- It was a worthy effort, Lance.
- It's not over.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.682
It doesn't have to be.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.392
It's time to go home.

42:00.643 --> 42:01.936
We still have Alexandria.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.729
I just need time
to get the other two.

42:05.022 --> 42:08.442
It was a bold move trying to bring
three new communities into the fold.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.737
I get why something like that
would be appealing to you.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.907
Someone needs to run them, right?

42:17.117 --> 42:19.495
That selection would be
at your discretion.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.414
Obviously.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.583
Obviously.

42:26.293 --> 42:27.962
I'm going to pretend that
you were doing this

42:27.962 --> 42:31.131
for the good of the Commonwealth
rather than for yourself.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.009
I was doing this for you.

42:38.138 --> 42:40.391
You've been ambitious
our whole lives, Lance.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.853
Ambition is notoriously hard
to reel in, so...

42:47.439 --> 42:49.650
If you want to try
and make it work, fine.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.903
But if your job at home
starts to suffer,

42:54.071 --> 42:55.531
there will be consequences.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.493
The Commonwealth always comes first.

43:37.906 --> 43:39.116
Lance.

43:40.909 --> 43:42.119
Lance, you okay?

43:42.745 --> 43:44.038
A-plus.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.546
What did she say about Alexandria?
We good?

43:57.176 --> 43:58.385
Everything's fine.

43:59.219 --> 44:00.429
Pamela's on board.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.890
In fact, we're gonna bring
even more people in.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.683
Get ready, Aaron.

44:05.851 --> 44:07.686
We're going to remake the world.
