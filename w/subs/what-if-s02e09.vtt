WEBVTT

00:38.500 --> 00:40.958
THE WATCHER: London. 1602.

00:41.083 --> 00:45.916
A world at peace thanks to a hero
from an entirely different universe,

00:46.000 --> 00:50.291
Captain Peggy Carter,
a warrior out of her own time.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.625
But then, she's used to that.

00:52.708 --> 00:58.583
The super soldier from World War II
who thrust herself into the future,

00:58.666 --> 01:03.250
saving her world, but leaving behind
the love of her life.

01:03.333 --> 01:06.125
It was a loss
that could have consumed her,

01:06.208 --> 01:09.166
but instead, it fueled her

01:09.250 --> 01:14.833
to become a hero for all time and times.

01:14.916 --> 01:20.500
Now, the captain once lost in the future
is trapped in the past.

01:20.583 --> 01:25.291
But even 400 years from home,
she's not alone.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.833
Your timing couldn't be better,
old friend.

01:27.916 --> 01:29.625
I was afraid I'd be stuck here forever.

01:29.708 --> 01:32.375
Oh, come on, you're already tired
of first-run Shakespeare

01:32.458 --> 01:33.833
and outdoor plumbing?

01:33.916 --> 01:35.916
Says the man with the high-collared cape.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.500
Yeah, says the woman
who wears a Union Jack as a shirt.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.666
-(CHUCKLES)
-At least mine's magic, Peggy.

01:40.750 --> 01:44.916
By the looks of things, this happy hour
could use a little more happiness. Bing.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.166
Single malt, a few centuries
ahead of schedule, of course.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.208
Oh, Strange, you're a lifesaver.

01:52.583 --> 01:56.000
Speaking of, any chance
you can offer me a lift home?

01:56.083 --> 01:58.958
I'd call a taxi, but I left my purse
in another dimension.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.666
Anything for a fellow
Guardian of the Multiverse.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.166
Come on, Peggy, step into my office.

02:05.458 --> 02:10.041
THE WATCHER: Theirs was the bond
of two heroes forged not just in battle,

02:10.125 --> 02:11.583
but in understanding.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.250
For, like Captain Carter,

02:14.333 --> 02:18.416
Doctor Stephen Strange had been
on a difficult journey of his own.

02:18.500 --> 02:23.458
In his pursuit to save Christine Palmer,
he destroyed his soul,

02:23.541 --> 02:25.583
his sanity, and his universe.

02:25.666 --> 02:30.208
Then punish me.
Not the world, not Christine.

02:30.291 --> 02:33.791
THE WATCHER: But it was only
as the world collapsed around him

02:33.875 --> 02:36.458
that he saw the error of his ways.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.500
Now, two legends must band together

02:40.583 --> 02:45.000
to face a threat
unlike any the Multiverse has ever faced.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.333
Time.

02:53.708 --> 02:54.791
Space.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.541
Reality.

03:00.416 --> 03:02.291
It's more than a linear path.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.625
It's a prism of endless possibility.

03:13.833 --> 03:17.666
Where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,

03:20.125 --> 03:23.166
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.750
I am the Watcher.

03:30.666 --> 03:33.708
I am your guide
through these vast new realities.

03:35.375 --> 03:38.750
Follow me and ponder the question...

03:42.541 --> 03:44.583
"What if?"

03:50.208 --> 03:52.500
STRANGE SUPREME:
Welcome to my humble abode,

03:53.125 --> 03:55.291
the Sanctum Infinitum.

03:55.375 --> 03:58.458
Well, this is certainly, uh, rustic.

03:58.541 --> 04:01.708
STRANGE SUPREME: Yeah, view's not bad.
Kitchen even has a pizza oven.

04:01.791 --> 04:05.291
PEGGY: Strange,
you've been here all alone?

04:05.375 --> 04:08.000
Well, not quite, I've been kind of busy.

04:08.083 --> 04:11.333
Let me see here, Infinity Ultron,
I think you know,

04:11.416 --> 04:13.208
and Thanos, Loki.

04:13.291 --> 04:16.291
Beings of untold power
hell-bent on destroying their universes.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.666
You know, the usual.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.875
You're collecting universe killers.

04:19.958 --> 04:21.583
Yeah, well, someone's gotta do it.

04:21.666 --> 04:25.500
And we both know the Watcher
would never stoop so low as to intervene.

04:25.583 --> 04:28.666
Saving the Multiverse
one universe at a time, huh?

04:28.750 --> 04:30.625
Your self-imposed penance?

04:31.458 --> 04:34.041
Hmm, I knew you'd understand.

04:34.125 --> 04:37.000
But look, there is actually something
I need your help with.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.750
Uh, Strange.
I'd rather go home. (CHUCKLES)

04:39.833 --> 04:43.750
Oh, oh, oh, you will. You will.
It's just... It's... I, uh...

04:43.833 --> 04:47.833
Yeah, it's... (SIGHS) It's actually,
it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.250
One of them's escaped.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.625
Yeah, how did you know?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.375
Gremlins. Aliens. Jurassic Park.

04:54.458 --> 04:58.375
Collect enough dangerous, well, anything,
and something always escapes.

04:58.458 --> 05:01.041
Great, then you'll help me
save the world or several of...

05:01.125 --> 05:02.625
-No.
-Pardon?

05:02.708 --> 05:04.583
I can already hear
the Watcher intoning that

05:04.666 --> 05:06.500
(MIMICS THE WATCHER)
"Meddling in the Multiverse

05:06.583 --> 05:09.708

05:09.791 --> 05:12.458
Oh, come on, Peg.
I know he's a fifth-dimensional being

05:12.541 --> 05:14.750
with that big head
and that soothing voice,

05:14.833 --> 05:16.625
but that doesn't always make him right.

05:16.708 --> 05:18.083
I mean, what, are you gonna tell me

05:18.166 --> 05:20.958
that it was wrong of you
to save the world of 1602?

05:22.583 --> 05:23.875
(SIGHS)

05:29.041 --> 05:30.916
So, who's our bad guy?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.833
(SCOFFS) Our bad guy is a she,
Captain Carter.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.208
My mistake.

05:36.916 --> 05:40.416
STRANGE SUPREME: I lost her trail here,
in the South Dakota Badlands.

05:40.625 --> 05:42.791
Well, what's left of them
in that universe, anyway.

05:47.916 --> 05:50.083
Wait. Strange. Why can't you just do this?

05:50.166 --> 05:53.750
Because you, my friend, are an unknown.
She'll see me coming a mile off.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.833
Oh, and here. Bing.

05:56.916 --> 05:59.500
-Oh, thank you.
-Don't mention it.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.208
Look, this will work out
pretty well, Peggy.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.958
You find her, then I'll be
able to bring you both back here.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.958
And then I'm out. You'll send me home?

06:06.041 --> 06:07.250
Cross my heart.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.875
Strange, how will I know it's her?

06:12.958 --> 06:15.041
Oh, trust me, you'll know.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.250
Oh, that's a little worrying.

(SIGHS) Well, look who it is.

06:45.291 --> 06:48.750
You here to help for a change?
Or just to narrate?

06:48.833 --> 06:50.250

06:50.333 --> 06:54.208

a bigger bang in this universe.

Neither you nor Steve Rogers survived.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.916
Without Captain Carter
or Captain America to stop them,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.625
HYDRA unleashed the Tesseract's powers,

07:02.708 --> 07:05.958
won the war,
and destroyed the world in the process.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.625
Right. So, you're here to narrate.

07:08.708 --> 07:09.875
It's my job.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.625
And what are you doing here, Captain?

07:13.708 --> 07:15.583
If you aren't going to help,
you can leave.

07:15.666 --> 07:19.291
I thought you learned the dangers
of interfering in worlds not your own.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.583
Spare me. We're never going to see
eye to eye on this.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.208
I get involved, you watch.

It's about seeing.
