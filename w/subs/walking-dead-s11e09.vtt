WEBVTT

00:29.362 --> 00:30.405
Get out!

00:30.905 --> 00:31.990
Ow!

00:32.615 --> 00:33.658
Get out!

00:40.457 --> 00:42.125
No! No!

00:43.918 --> 00:45.336
No!

01:42.102 --> 01:44.354
- I've got one on my tail.
- We lost ours.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.690
We need to take care
of that bleeding. Let's go.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.334
This way.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.480
Okay, what now?

02:28.398 --> 02:30.650
Wait till dawn. Hunt them down.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.361
Why don't we just
get the food and go?

02:33.444 --> 02:35.697
Yeah, we're going to walk
out of here with our arms full.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.617
As long as we walk
out of here, yeah.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.703
Unless chow ain't the only thing
we're here for.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.997
I'm not leaving Daryl and Gabriel

02:44.080 --> 02:46.583
and I won't risk
being followed home.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.005
Carver, report.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.799
In the infirmary.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.968
The leader slugged me,
but I'll get her.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.764
Just find her. Not one of them
is getting out of here alive.

03:01.890 --> 03:02.974
Copy that.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.244
Look out!

04:12.585 --> 04:13.670
Hey!

04:14.003 --> 04:16.965
We can't find Judith and Gracie.
They never made it out.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.467
Okay! You're with us!

04:19.550 --> 04:21.261
We get through this
and we will find them.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.953
- It's not going to hold.
- It will.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.663
Come on.

05:04.846 --> 05:05.930
I've got it.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.730
What else can we use?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.296
Rain's not helping.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.340
The wind just keeps
stoking the flames.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.011
Sorry, boss,
but it's scorching in there.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.306
- It might be time to call it off.
- No.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.766
We just got to try something else.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.269
Like a fire truck.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.067
Hey! Hey! Come here.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.444
Come on! Come on!

06:08.659 --> 06:10.870
- The breach?
- We closed the one by the gate.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.580
Good. Let's focus on the flames.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.624
Hang on. There's too many sickos
inside the walls.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.084
There's got to be another breach.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.752
Scott and the others
are checking the cul-de-sac

06:17.835 --> 06:19.420
and we're headed
towards the east wall.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.671
If this windmill falls,

06:20.755 --> 06:22.673
it can create
an opening too big to close.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.224
I'll go with you. We find the breach

06:31.307 --> 06:33.309
and you take care
of the windmill, okay?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.894
All right.

06:44.278 --> 06:48.199
- What's that?
- Gracie. It's her emergency signal.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.371
Put out that fire
or we could lose everything. Go!

07:27.530 --> 07:28.698
For Pope.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.881
Austin, you in there? Austin?

08:26.964 --> 08:28.633
Break it down.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.275
- No.
- Shit.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.244
No more.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.693
We need to get to the window.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.456
- If we could reach this pipe...
- It's too high...

09:42.540 --> 09:43.833
No!

09:44.750 --> 09:46.544
- No!

09:50.506 --> 09:52.008
- Gracie!
- Judith!

10:05.229 --> 10:08.232
- Gracie! Stay there!
- Daddy!

10:10.026 --> 10:11.068
Dad!

10:11.861 --> 10:14.071
Come on! Come on!

10:14.155 --> 10:15.740
Stay there! Stay there!

10:16.532 --> 10:17.575
Come on! Come on!

10:18.242 --> 10:20.828
- Come on! Come on!

10:29.045 --> 10:30.546
Go to the window!

10:31.047 --> 10:32.965
- The window!

11:01.869 --> 11:04.705
- Dad! Are you okay?
- Are you?

11:04.789 --> 11:05.873
There's more.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.876
Let's go.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.765
Come on, Judith!

11:34.860 --> 11:36.696
- Keep going!
- What about you?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.073
- I'll get help.
- Go! Get Gracie to safety first.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.574
I got this.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.455
That's far enough.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.001
Can't let you harm one of my flock.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.466
Worry about yourself first.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.885
God will stay your hand,

12:41.969 --> 12:44.013
just like he did
at the graves yesterday.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.561
- You knew I was there?
- The Lord did.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.772
He told me I had nothing to fear.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.232
- You hear Him?
- I do.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.612
And He tells you
to defend these people?

12:59.695 --> 13:01.655
His hand guides my every step.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.115
These are monsters

13:04.825 --> 13:07.536
who slaughter entire towns
without provocation,

13:07.661 --> 13:10.706
massacre children.
And you pray for them?

13:11.832 --> 13:15.169
- How could God speak to you?
- My role is not to question.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.338
I listen and serve.

13:19.256 --> 13:22.384
Just following orders, huh?
Where have I heard that before?

13:22.468 --> 13:25.679
True faith requires doubt
and I have mine.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.433
Violence is not the path I'd take,

13:30.392 --> 13:33.729
but blood has been spilt
in God's name for centuries.

13:34.897 --> 13:39.235
His will is unknown to us.
All I can do is trust in Him.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.990
God wouldn't allow you
to murder my friends

13:45.074 --> 13:48.285
and neither will I. Move aside.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.386
You don't hear Him anymore, do you?

14:07.471 --> 14:10.766
- My flock is worth saving.
- Is that your choice or His?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.311
Do you even listen anymore? Listen.

14:18.482 --> 14:23.529
He's here with us right now,
asking you to hear Him again.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.780
Will you?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.994
Or will you cut down a man
that he's placed in your path?

14:32.538 --> 14:35.207
The path of peace is hard.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.753
But we can take the first steps
together for both of our flocks.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.589
Take my hand.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.593
Renew your faith.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.556
Allow yourself to be saved
no matter what any of us have done.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.058
No one is above saving.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.203
I don't believe that.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.234
Oops. Wrong turn.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.411
You killed my sister.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.747
Okay.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.844
Well, I got to say thanks for this.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.180
I was getting tired
of all the searching.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.399
Hey!

17:07.067 --> 17:08.694
Over here, shit dick.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.367
This should be fun.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.708
Well, ding-ding.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.587
Thanks, kid.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.052
Stop!

18:20.224 --> 18:21.975
Should have took you out right off.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.026
We don't kill him yet.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.903
He needs to pay for what he did.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.489
I agree.
But if we go down that road...

18:38.075 --> 18:41.120
we ain't all gonna
make it out alive. No offense.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.789
I hate this prick.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.753
But we got him now, let's use him.
Get what we want and go home.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.174
- Are you doing this for her?
- No.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.135
No, I'm not. I'm doing it for us.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.513
Leah wants us gone,
but not more than saving

18:59.596 --> 19:01.640
her own family,
especially this asshole.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.309
This could go wrong
800 different ways.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.980
Me, I am down with us
getting out of this alive.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.773
- No!
- Elijah.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.776
You're just going to
let him walk away?

19:12.860 --> 19:16.029
They will get what's coming to them.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.575
Maybe not today, but they will.
I promise.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.493
Leah.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.247
It's me. We need to talk.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.551
Shit.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.473
That whistle came
from downstairs, right?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.100
Use that window. Get to the cellar.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.727
- We got this.
- Okay.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.514
Shit! Oh, shit!

20:46.203 --> 20:47.913
Aaron? Aaron!

20:47.996 --> 20:49.206
In here!

20:51.250 --> 20:54.753
- Okay, hold on. I'll be right back.
- Sure.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.129
I'm not going anywhere.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.186
Are you okay?

21:12.896 --> 21:14.273
Thank you.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.775
You would have done the same for me.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.695
I would.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.283
- Gracie? Judith?
- They're safe.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.537
- The walkers?
- Dianne and Rosita, they're on it.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.081
- Okay.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.875
Let's go help with the windmill.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.985
Leave me here if you have to.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.238
Just make sure he's dead.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.824
I'm not going anywhere without you.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.828
No matter what happens, okay?

22:22.632 --> 22:23.759
You ready?

22:26.303 --> 22:27.429
Yeah.

22:29.222 --> 22:33.352
Here, take this, just in case.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.606
Leah.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.232
We're here.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.117
Come out.
Put your weapons on the ground.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.244
I need to see Carver first!

22:52.746 --> 22:53.955
Take that.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.666
Come out!

23:01.671 --> 23:03.131
Put your weapons on the ground.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.136
What are you offering?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.598
Lose the weapons, we let you leave.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.726
- Is that all?
- You head north, don't turn back.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.562
I see anyone, anyone at all,
I'm going to kill him.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.482
Once we're far out enough,
I let him go.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.527
- Shut up.
- You expect me to trust you now?

23:23.610 --> 23:24.986
Yeah, I do.

23:26.446 --> 23:30.826
We're doing this all wrong.
We survived everything for what?

23:30.909 --> 23:32.702
To keep fighting
and killing each other?

23:33.328 --> 23:34.621
If that's what it takes.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.416
You don't have to.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.712
I'm giving you a chance to save
what's left of your family and mine.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.437
No more lies. Jensen.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.442
That was a warning!

24:04.317 --> 24:05.360
The last one!

24:06.945 --> 24:08.113
Everybody out!

24:18.832 --> 24:20.625
Lower the knife. Cut the rope.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.840
Jensen, the woman.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.469
Fine.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.569
Elijah, don't.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.280
No one moves!

24:50.363 --> 24:51.990
Elijah.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.743
- He takes one more step, he dies!
- Josephine.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.745
- Carve, don't.
- Stop.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.997
- Jensen, pull the trigger.
- Her name was Josephine...

25:08.089 --> 25:09.549
Jensen, what the hell?

25:10.175 --> 25:12.344
- Jensen!
- Nope.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.138
No Jensen here.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.354
Call me "Gabriel."

25:25.232 --> 25:27.359
The other two better back off
or they're next.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.112
Stand down.

25:37.869 --> 25:41.039
- Your deal still stand?
- You had your chance.

25:42.123 --> 25:44.000
You would have killed us.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.087
Picked us off one by one, right?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.549
Now Gabriel does
the same thing to you.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.136
Maybe you're right.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.473
Your friend has the rifle,

26:00.475 --> 26:03.603
but I bet we take a couple of you
down before he takes us all.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.899
You can have your town. We walk.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.906
You save your family, I save mine.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.992
Yeah.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.833
Negan.

26:27.669 --> 26:28.878
You know what I think.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.222
Drop your weapons and go.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.186
- Not without Carver.
- No.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.197
Do it.

26:58.867 --> 26:59.993
I said, do it.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.631
I'll see you soon.

27:27.854 --> 27:28.897
Elijah.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.736
For Josephine. For all of them.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.029
Get up.

27:42.577 --> 27:43.620
Get up.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.011
Maggie, no!

28:09.604 --> 28:10.980
What the hell was that?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.136
This is not what I wanted.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.434
Could have had a second chance.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.561
We both could have.

29:38.818 --> 29:41.112
Go. Go before I change my mind.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.107
I'm going to head out.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.278
We'll catch up with you
when we can, okay?

30:22.362 --> 30:23.530
Be careful.

30:28.409 --> 30:31.079
I'll be back soon. Promise.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.722
Alden!

32:17.894 --> 32:19.020
Alden?

34:04.667 --> 34:08.421
You were always gonna do
what you did, Maggie.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.969
I don't blame you, really.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.474
You see when it comes to me,

34:20.600 --> 34:22.018
promise or not,

34:24.145 --> 34:27.398
it's just a matter of time
before you make the same call.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.614
So,

34:35.573 --> 34:39.952
I ain't going to give you
the chance to do that.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.676
I'm going to be on my own way.

35:23.162 --> 35:27.041
I heard what you said.
"We're doing it wrong."

35:32.004 --> 35:34.799
I was just thinking about choices.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.637
Do they even matter anymore?

35:40.763 --> 35:43.474
Depends on who's making the choice.

35:45.601 --> 35:49.814
Doubt's important,
but it doesn't make you wrong.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.193
You telling me to have faith?

35:56.654 --> 35:58.990
Yeah, I suppose so, yes.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.367
What about you?

36:03.452 --> 36:05.121
Yeah, I'm trying.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.377
I'm trying.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.233
Alden?

36:46.287 --> 36:49.832
You see Negan?
He said he'd catch up.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.296
He left.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.803
Hey, Maggie.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.417
All quiet?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.274
Where's everyone else?

38:15.918 --> 38:17.712
Uncle Daryl!

38:19.171 --> 38:20.798
Yeah. Oh!

38:20.881 --> 38:22.550
Hey, buddy.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.176
- Missed you, Mom.
- Missed you as well.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.053
You've been good? Yeah?

38:35.563 --> 38:37.898
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.323
- Where's Negan?
- He left.

38:46.282 --> 38:49.535
He ain't coming back here.
Here you go. Just take one.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.290
Hey, you want one?

38:56.542 --> 38:57.918
You want one?

39:07.261 --> 39:08.971
Is that our food?

39:09.513 --> 39:11.557
We made a promise and we kept it.

39:12.892 --> 39:13.934
Yes, you did.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.896
Yeah, just one. Yeah.

39:21.233 --> 39:22.360
No way.

39:25.696 --> 39:26.906
Happy to see you.

39:30.451 --> 39:31.660
Yeah.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.290
Hey, you want an apple? Yeah?

39:48.761 --> 39:52.932
I have so many questions
for you. Yeah.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.475
We'll fix it up.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.185
Hey, man.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.773
You all right? Alden?

40:03.109 --> 40:04.610
He's gone.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.489
So many didn't make it,

40:09.365 --> 40:10.825
all so we could survive.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.371
And we will.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.625
After the storm,
we had nothing left.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.627
Thank you.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.971
Hey! Got something coming!

40:43.566 --> 40:45.818
These guys with you?

40:46.026 --> 40:47.361
Guess not.

40:48.654 --> 40:50.990
Everyone, get ready!

40:54.952 --> 40:56.787
No, no, no, no.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.206
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.378
We're all friends.
We're all friends.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.174
They're here to help.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.970
Ezekiel, Yumiko, and I
set out on a journey.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.723
Charged ourselves with finding hope
in our darkest of days.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.310
Suffice to say
we hit the proverbial jackpot.

41:19.435 --> 41:20.978
It's probably best
that I step aside,

41:21.061 --> 41:22.980
so y'all can hear it
from the horse's mouth, as it were.

41:23.063 --> 41:25.691
I give you Mr. Lance Hornsby,

41:26.609 --> 41:28.903
diplomatic representative
of the Commonwealth.

41:34.533 --> 41:37.328
Hello, I'm Lance.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.957
Thank you for allowing us
into your home.

41:42.541 --> 41:46.212
I must say, I am impressed
with everything you've built here

41:47.087 --> 41:49.006
and what I've heard
of your other communities.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.050
But it's clear

41:53.093 --> 41:54.553
you've fallen on hard times.

41:55.888 --> 41:59.183
And that is where the Commonwealth
is more than willing to help.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.853
If you remain,
we can provide labor and materials

42:02.937 --> 42:05.272
to help you build back
all you've lost.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.150
However,

42:09.401 --> 42:10.611
if any are interested,

42:12.613 --> 42:14.031
I do have another

42:14.990 --> 42:17.618
potentially more interesting choice
to offer.

42:39.848 --> 42:41.058
Open up.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.979
Doesn't have to be this way.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.443
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
