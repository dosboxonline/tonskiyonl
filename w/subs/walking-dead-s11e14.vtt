WEBVTT

00:33.294 --> 00:35.861
- Sir.
- Hmm?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.733
Thank you.

00:41.084 --> 00:44.696
Home Fire 1, this is Open Range,
do you copy?

00:47.264 --> 00:48.613
Copy,
Open Range.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.267
Status?

00:50.311 --> 00:51.573
Location secured,
brother.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.489
Fantastic.

00:54.532 --> 00:55.925
The shipment?

00:55.968 --> 00:57.448
We're searching
floor by floor.

00:57.492 --> 00:58.884
The residents
haven't been...

00:58.928 --> 01:01.670
very cooperative.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.193
<i>I'm surprised.</i>

01:03.237 --> 01:05.239
These people have regressed
into God knows what.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.241
It's like
getting mad at a rat

01:07.284 --> 01:08.894
that can't tell
right from wrong.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.245
Yeah, well, the small taste
of some law and order

01:11.288 --> 01:12.898
will help them remember.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.075
<i>It sure will.</i>

01:15.118 --> 01:16.641
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

01:16.685 --> 01:18.078
Copy.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.168
Sir.

01:21.211 --> 01:23.039
What?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.781
We've got two down
at the east exit.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.701
No! No, no!

02:50.126 --> 02:52.302
Daryl.
Hi.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.217
Hey.
Was just
looking for you.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.784
Yeah?

02:55.827 --> 02:59.179
Been doing a little more
of the side thing lately.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.832
Anything else
about home?

03:00.876 --> 03:03.357
Not exactly, but --Dixon.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.186
You joining us today?

03:06.229 --> 03:08.840
Yeah.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.581
You want
to have lunch later?

03:10.625 --> 03:12.192
Yeah.
Noon at the diner?

03:12.235 --> 03:13.193
It's a date.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.803
Okay.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.209
What?

03:30.601 --> 03:32.212
Just really living up
to that stereotype.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.650
I mean,
I liked 'em before.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.611
No? Mm.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.396
Good morning.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.876
Today's duty assignments
are as follows --

03:44.920 --> 03:46.878
Douglas and Ross,
Sector A.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.402
Lim and Baker,
you're B.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.230
McHugh and Howell,
take C.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.233
And Espinosa and Dixon,
I want you on Sector D.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.626
Any questions?

03:55.670 --> 03:57.846
Alright,
let's get to it.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.638
You're just staring
at those teeth.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.252
You see, the problem
that most people have

04:12.295 --> 04:13.818
is when
they start to panic.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.211
But when
I'm around the rotters,

04:15.255 --> 04:17.039
my heart rate
actually goes <i>down.</i>

04:17.082 --> 04:19.433
Dixon's seen it.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.130
Seen what?

04:21.173 --> 04:22.436
How I handle myself
with the rotters.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.439
Come on.

04:25.482 --> 04:26.744
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.181
It's, uh --
It's good stuff.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.893
Hey, Dixon,
Espinosa...

04:44.936 --> 04:46.329
What's up?

04:46.373 --> 04:47.896
Swarm's been spotted
near the north perimeter.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.463
We've been assigned
to check it out.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.291
Vicker says
we only work patrol.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.901
Yeah,
and now she wants to see

04:52.944 --> 04:55.817
what you can do
outside the walls.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.862
Look, your sector's covered,
so let's go.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.473
Come on!

05:39.556 --> 05:41.732
One more step,
you die.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.957
Drop your weapons.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.529
You first.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.921
Not happening.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.532
We're here to help.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.098
And who the hell
are you?

06:00.142 --> 06:02.884
Her name is Maggie.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.365
Jesus.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.764
Everybody.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.812
Let's put our shit
back in our pants and zip up.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.596
Shall we?

06:31.434 --> 06:34.002
Hey, kiddo.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.004
What are you
doing here?

06:39.834 --> 06:41.531
We live here.

06:43.446 --> 06:47.015
Okay.
So what now?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.408
They have Gabriel.

06:48.451 --> 06:51.541
No,
they don't.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.195
Come on.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.341
Ian -- he walled up the doors
to hide the apartment.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.300
There's a couple
in the building.

07:11.343 --> 07:12.649
Maggie?

07:12.693 --> 07:16.044
Hey.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.349
I wasn't sure
you'd made it.

07:17.393 --> 07:20.440
I almost didn't.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.485
Did your people
steal their guns?

07:22.529 --> 07:24.487
Hijack their convoy?
No.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.837
You sure about that?

07:26.881 --> 07:29.492
I am really sick of them
asking me this.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.276
So am I.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.843
You know, why don't you
just ball up

07:32.887 --> 07:34.758
and stop tiptoeing around it
and call her a liar.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.196
Your boss had skulls
on his bookcase,

07:38.240 --> 07:40.242
so, yeah,
I'm inclined to call bullshit.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.852
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
Then who did?

07:41.896 --> 07:44.638
It doesn't matter.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.466
We have to get these people
out of here.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.902
We can't leave.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.078
Not with the rest of my people
still hiding.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.471
Okay.
What do you want to do?

07:51.514 --> 07:52.776
Split into teams,

07:52.820 --> 07:54.865
sweep each floor
for whoever's left,

07:54.909 --> 07:58.086
then find
a way out together.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.870
Okay.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.306
Alright,
let's go.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.873
You stay here.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.310
They need someone they trust
protecting them.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.056
She comes with me.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.510
How much longer?

08:30.553 --> 08:32.512
Oh,
not long.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.344
There it is.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.524
Where's everybody else?

08:44.567 --> 08:47.527
There is no one else.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.746
You want the four of us
to take all that out?

08:49.790 --> 08:51.487
You aren't
gonna take them out.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.534
You're gonna
go through them.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.710
What are you
talking about?

08:56.753 --> 08:59.364
I'm talking about
my buddy Cooper.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.149
We grew up together.

09:01.192 --> 09:04.718
He lived in a big house --
right -- right down there.

09:04.761 --> 09:08.112
His dad was actually
the president of SDS Bank.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.945
Anyway, his dad
was also a prepper,

09:14.989 --> 09:17.165
so he turned his office
into a panic room.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.732
It's where he kept
all his good shit,

09:18.775 --> 09:21.735
like whiskey,
weed, E, coke.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.737
He also
kept cash in there.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.303
Lots of it.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.175
And that is what
I need you to get for me.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.570
This is a joke,
right?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.789
No, sweetie, it isn't.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.574
Alright, look,
my bitch mother

09:34.617 --> 09:36.140
has cut off
my line of credit,

09:36.184 --> 09:39.361
so I need to come up
with creative ways to...

09:39.404 --> 09:40.710
support my lifestyle.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.494
So have
these dickheads do it.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.540
They don't want to because
they can't shoot down there.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.108
You see,
fired rounds are tracked,

09:47.151 --> 09:48.675
so it'd
raise questions.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.590
And if these guys
can't shoot guns, well,

09:50.633 --> 09:53.984
they would probably
get dog-piled and suffocate.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.595
But you two?

09:55.638 --> 09:57.205
I know
that you can do it.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.424
I --
I believe in you.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.775
Now,
this is the code

10:01.818 --> 10:04.038
to the office's
electric lock.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.040
Now, there's a solar generator
in the garage

10:06.083 --> 10:07.607
that you can
go thro--
Nah.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.217
No,
we ain't doing it.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.219
Yes,
you are.

10:17.573 --> 10:21.185
Now, you're gonna
slime yourself up with guts,

10:21.229 --> 10:23.623
and then you are gonna
walk through that swarm,

10:23.666 --> 10:26.364
and you are gonna
get me my cash.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.846
Or what?

10:31.718 --> 10:34.285
Hey,
how are your kids doing?

10:34.329 --> 10:36.636
Your little one, he just jumped
two grades, right?

10:36.679 --> 10:39.160
And -- And Coco,
is she walking yet?

10:40.465 --> 10:42.293
Hey, hey.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.252
You think your "advanced
military training's"

10:44.295 --> 10:45.601
gonna help you
right now?

10:45.645 --> 10:46.994
Drop it,
or you're both dead!

10:47.037 --> 10:48.430
Not before I take
this asshole's head off.

10:48.473 --> 10:51.259
Let's get something
a little straight.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.087
You threaten our kids
one more time,

10:53.130 --> 10:54.523
and I will gut you --
Hey!

10:54.566 --> 10:57.265
Hey, who said anything
about hurting kids?

10:57.308 --> 11:00.834
I'm just saying that
I can make their life easier.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.053
Or you can make them
both orphans.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.968
It's your call.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.279
We do this,
and that's it?

11:11.322 --> 11:12.672
Yeah.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.674
Totally.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.374
Hey.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.593
Blood --
it's fresh.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.993
This way.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.174
Over here.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.398
You need power
for the lock.

13:10.441 --> 13:13.009
Hey, behind you.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.629
Can't be more than a few days
since they've turned.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.153
Yeah.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.200
Hello?

13:30.244 --> 13:31.462
Hey!

13:31.506 --> 13:33.638
Are you with
another group?!

13:33.682 --> 13:35.205
We're with
The Commonwealth Army.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.425
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.861
The money is in here,
but I'm --

13:38.905 --> 13:41.168
I'm the only one
who's left.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.213
He's done this before.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.563
Please, please!
Please don't leave me!

13:45.607 --> 13:46.869
- No, no.
- Don't leave me!

13:46.913 --> 13:48.088
I've been in here so long!
Please!

13:48.131 --> 13:49.393
No, no, no.
We won't.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.395
We're not with the people
who sent you in.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.006
Did they force you
in here?

13:53.049 --> 13:56.357
I was in debt,
and then, uh, one day,

13:56.400 --> 13:57.749
a man
showed up at my door,

13:57.793 --> 14:01.275
and he said he could
get me get out of it.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.059
I have two kids.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.887
I have two kids.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.455
It's okay, it's okay.
Where --Please!

14:07.498 --> 14:10.632
How many of you
were sent in?

14:10.675 --> 14:11.981
12 of us.

14:12.025 --> 14:15.071
But only three of us
made it inside.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.682
We got the generators on,
and then -- and then,

14:17.726 --> 14:20.903
the two guys that I was with,
they turned on each other.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.036
So I locked them out,
and that's --

14:23.079 --> 14:24.428
that's when
the power went off,

14:24.472 --> 14:27.083
and I-I haven't been
to get this door open!

14:27.127 --> 14:29.477
You stay with her.
I'll go find the generator.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.044
It's alright.
Just hang on, okay?

14:31.087 --> 14:32.436
Okay.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.829
What's your name?

14:33.873 --> 14:37.659
My name's April.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.052
I'm Rosita.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.402
Rosita.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.707
Listen, I don't want you
to worry.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.361
We're gonna make this work,
okay?

14:53.501 --> 14:56.069
You left
without saying a word.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.941
I left
because I gave a shit.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.509
I left because that's
what everyone needed.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.685
Right?

15:03.728 --> 15:04.947
How'd you find them?

15:04.991 --> 15:07.515
And your --
what is she to you?

15:10.822 --> 15:12.085
You're married?

15:12.128 --> 15:13.825
It's crazy,
right?

15:13.869 --> 15:16.089
You being here fits.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.569
You have a hand in putting any
of those skulls on Ian's shelf?

15:18.613 --> 15:20.789
Says the guy that rolled up
with the Gestapo.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.922
We didn't know.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.836
The place we're living now
is different

15:24.880 --> 15:26.708
from any place
we've ever seen.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.275
No,
it isn't.

15:28.318 --> 15:31.191
I hoped that
they might be, but...

15:31.234 --> 15:33.889
they just want to swallow up
other communities.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.108
They're like
the Whisperers.

15:35.151 --> 15:38.807
They just
wear different masks.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.722
<i>Negan, do you copy?</i>

15:40.765 --> 15:42.593
Yeah.
Where are you?

15:42.637 --> 15:44.073
<i>Fifth floor.</i>

15:44.117 --> 15:45.640
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>the soldiers are spread out,</i>

15:45.683 --> 15:46.946
<i>but our</i>
<i>window's closing.</i>

15:46.989 --> 15:48.556
<i>Tell the others</i>
<i>to move.</i>

15:48.599 --> 15:51.298
Copy that.

15:51.341 --> 15:54.127
Hey, is Maggie
still with you?

15:54.170 --> 15:56.781
<i>She is.</i>

15:56.825 --> 15:59.567
Alright, look.
It's just, um...

15:59.610 --> 16:01.743
<i>Stop worrying.</i>

16:01.786 --> 16:03.353
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

16:08.402 --> 16:10.273
Oh, shit.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.066
Sit and stay!

16:23.243 --> 16:25.375
Sarge, I found a truck
on the perimeter.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.203
Kid hiding inside.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.597
<i>Did you say a kid?</i> Affirmative.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.895
We're all clear down here.
Take your gear upstairs.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.250
Ginger?

17:17.123 --> 17:19.864
I'm 12 weeks,
give or take.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.871
And yeah,
it's his.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.048
Not that he'd want me
telling you.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.054
<i>Hey, Annie, do you copy?</i>

17:37.447 --> 17:38.709
I'm here.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.929
I found someone.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.192
<i>Who?</i>

17:43.236 --> 17:44.715
Maggie's son.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.286
What?!

17:50.330 --> 17:51.853
Yeah.

17:51.896 --> 17:55.248
Turns out you had stowaway
that you didn't know about.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.293
I'm coming to you.

17:57.337 --> 18:00.253
No.
You stay with Annie.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.645
Negan --

18:01.689 --> 18:03.430
He's safe.
Alright?

18:03.473 --> 18:05.040
You stay focused.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.868
If anything
happens to him...

18:06.911 --> 18:09.262
It'll have to happen
to me first.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.192
He's in good hands.

18:28.498 --> 18:31.110
He's in the hands of the man
who killed his father.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.117
Five clear.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.946
I know who he is.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.687
And what he did.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.950
He told me.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.303
And you're
still with him?

18:50.346 --> 18:52.740
None of us
have clean hands.

18:54.524 --> 18:57.005
I've seen what people will do
to each other to survive.

18:58.354 --> 19:01.314
Sometimes,
it was done to me.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.404
Other times,
I did it to them.

19:04.447 --> 19:07.363
I'm not proud of it,
but it happened.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.586
All I can do now
is try to be better.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.327
Just like him.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.811
He doesn't
get to forget.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.989
He hasn't.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.169
Post two out front,
nearest the front gate!

19:30.212 --> 19:32.997
What matters to me
is who he is now.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.350
He's someone who'll do
whatever he can

19:37.393 --> 19:39.003
to protect your boy.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.190
My mom told me
to stay away from you.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.020
Well, your mom
is a very smart lady.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.197
Why doesn't
she like you?

20:03.289 --> 20:07.031
Because of something
that happened a long time ago.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.208
Was it something bad?

20:12.254 --> 20:14.604
Yeah.

20:14.648 --> 20:18.260
Yeah, it was, uh --
it was something bad.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.699
Are you a bad man?

20:27.661 --> 20:29.532
I was.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.066
Look, kid, I --

20:48.464 --> 20:50.640
My mom told me
a bad man killed my dad.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.861
It was you,
wasn't it?

21:00.694 --> 21:03.087
Yeah.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.741
Yeah,
it was me.

21:13.489 --> 21:16.449
Look...

21:16.492 --> 21:20.322
Kid, what I took away
from you and your mom,

21:20.366 --> 21:22.281
there is nothing
I can say or do

21:22.324 --> 21:25.893
that is gonna
make that better.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.982
And I know you want to pull
that trigger,

21:28.025 --> 21:29.723
and I don't
blame you.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.771
The thing is,
if you do,

21:34.815 --> 21:37.470
the bad people are gonna know
where we're hiding.

21:40.342 --> 21:44.346
Maybe I deserve to die
for what I did to your dad,

21:44.390 --> 21:45.913
to your family...

21:47.958 --> 21:50.831
...but these
people here...

21:50.874 --> 21:52.311
they don't.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.628
April,
are you still with me?

24:15.671 --> 24:17.281
Yes.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.501
Alright,
we're coming in.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.852
Oh, God.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.463
Thank you!
Thank you!

24:24.506 --> 24:27.074
- Okay, okay.
- Thank you!

24:27.117 --> 24:29.293
The safe
is right there.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.643
- Can you get into it?
- I don't know.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.645
We'll try.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.087
Oh!

24:41.392 --> 24:43.090
What is that?

24:45.571 --> 24:47.834
Aw, shit.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.319
No!
No, no, no!

24:55.363 --> 24:57.104
No, they're drawn
inside the house!

24:57.147 --> 24:58.758
- Okay, alright!
- Shut it off!

24:58.801 --> 25:00.455
Yeah, I just have to cut
the power to the circuit board.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.675
Hurry. Hurry!

25:09.246 --> 25:10.465
Hurry!

25:24.435 --> 25:26.133
Come here!
Give me a hand!

25:29.179 --> 25:30.572
Oh, they're coming!
Please, hurry!

25:30.616 --> 25:32.531
I know!

25:33.836 --> 25:35.490
Hurry, please!

25:35.534 --> 25:36.709
Come on.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.145
Move away
from the door.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.339
We go out the same way
we came in.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.515
No sudden moves.
- We walk right out that door.
- Okay.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.951
You ready?
Wait.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.563
She doesn't have
enough blood on her.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.477
Oh, God.
No.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.436
- Put that on.
- What about you?

26:08.479 --> 26:10.743
I'll be fine.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.788
Thank you.

26:45.212 --> 26:48.171
You gonna let us in
or what?

26:48.215 --> 26:51.218
How'd you know
where we were?

26:51.261 --> 26:53.437
You didn't show up for lunch,
so I got Mercer.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.266
Alves and Castle said

26:56.310 --> 26:58.617
you came here
to steal some money.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.270
Nope.

27:00.314 --> 27:03.186
That did not happen.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.797
What, y'all looting houses now?
Is that it?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.059
Sebastian made us
come in here.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.669
He threatened our kids.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.105
And who are you?

27:09.149 --> 27:10.803
Some soldiers brought
a group of us here,

27:10.846 --> 27:12.631
and they told us
that if we --

27:12.674 --> 27:15.198
we got in, we could have
a cut of the money.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.636
How many
were in your group?

27:17.679 --> 27:20.029
12.
Now it's just me.

27:25.469 --> 27:26.775
How many more rounds
we got?

27:29.299 --> 27:32.041
Maybe 10.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.000
Lot more walkers out there
than that.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.437
We gut up, and we go.

28:36.279 --> 28:39.456
No! No! No!

29:37.384 --> 29:39.560
No! No, please!

29:39.603 --> 29:42.606
No! No, no!
No, no, no, please!

29:46.219 --> 29:48.177
Alright.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.962
These people...

29:50.005 --> 29:52.616
Anyone you find, they refuse
to give you something useful,

29:52.660 --> 29:54.183
you just pop them in the head
and move on.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.185
We find our guns
in the next hour

29:56.229 --> 29:58.622
or we burn
this place to the ground.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.814
Gabriel, Aaron,
you there?

30:15.857 --> 30:17.032
<i>We're here.</i>

30:17.076 --> 30:19.818
Is Elijah with you? <i>He is.</i>

30:19.861 --> 30:22.211
Good.
I have a plan.

30:39.446 --> 30:42.449
Anything?

30:42.492 --> 30:44.451
Nothing, sir.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.901
Aaron, up to the roof!

31:42.944 --> 31:44.293
It's that
goddamn priest again.

31:44.337 --> 31:46.513
Let's go!

31:48.123 --> 31:49.472
Stop!

31:49.516 --> 31:52.214
Drop it!

32:07.577 --> 32:10.102
Just enough
of this shit!

32:14.149 --> 32:15.934
What are you
even thinking?

32:15.977 --> 32:17.587
Huh?
Just turning on me?

32:17.631 --> 32:19.241
On The Commonwealth?
For what?

32:19.285 --> 32:22.549
Some tenement warlord and
all these thieving followers?

32:22.592 --> 32:25.247
I just -- I really thought
you were smarter than all that.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.518
All Troopers,
up to the roof, now!

32:35.562 --> 32:36.955
Commander needs assistance!

32:36.998 --> 32:38.782
<i>Sir, we have</i>
<i>combatants inbound.</i>

32:40.393 --> 32:42.743
<i>Fall back!</i>

32:45.615 --> 32:47.748
Okay.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.793
Okay.

32:49.837 --> 32:52.579
Ooh.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.364
That's good.

32:55.408 --> 32:58.063
The wisdom to know
the difference, right?

32:59.629 --> 33:03.372
Look, things just got
a little out of hand.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.332
We all just need to --
hoo! --

33:06.375 --> 33:08.290
take a breath, right?

33:14.427 --> 33:16.385
Listen.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.909
Listen, we just need
to talk things --

33:21.434 --> 33:24.524
Aah!

33:37.537 --> 33:39.713
Oh, God!

33:39.756 --> 33:41.932
Oh, God!

33:41.976 --> 33:43.760
No!

33:43.804 --> 33:47.286
Oh, God, no!

33:49.505 --> 33:51.942
No! No!

33:51.986 --> 33:54.423
Help! No!

34:14.356 --> 34:16.880
Could've used
your help back there.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.926
Yeah, looks like it.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.668
But we don't
answer to you.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.713
That the money?

34:28.501 --> 34:31.069
How many others
did you send in before them?

34:31.112 --> 34:32.418
I don't know.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.463
What, 30?
Maybe 40?

34:34.507 --> 34:37.423
Hey, at least
we're coming home with --

35:02.535 --> 35:04.928
You have to
pay him.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.713
Sebastian.
What?

35:06.756 --> 35:08.106
No --If you don't,
he'll come after you,

35:08.149 --> 35:10.543
and that's a fight
you ain't gonna win.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.947
I'll carry the bags
through the gate.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.515
They won't search me.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.735
Alright.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.962
There they are!

35:39.006 --> 35:41.139
So?

35:47.188 --> 35:48.537
Yes!

35:48.581 --> 35:50.060
Well done,
ladies and gents!

35:50.104 --> 35:51.758
Well done!

35:51.801 --> 35:53.107
Yes!

35:53.151 --> 35:56.154
Hey,
where are...?

35:56.197 --> 35:58.982
Where are
Alves and Castle?

35:59.026 --> 36:00.984
They didn't make it.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.075
Huh.

36:11.038 --> 36:14.346
- What's that?
- That is your cut.

36:14.389 --> 36:17.566
I'm of course
going to pay you.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.786
Oh, my God --
congrats, guys!

36:19.829 --> 36:22.005
We did it!

36:22.049 --> 36:25.357
Hey, I am so glad
that we're friends again.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.794
Hmm.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.375
Open Range, do you copy?

36:46.856 --> 36:48.815
Open Range...

37:02.394 --> 37:03.656
Yeah.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.051
Hey.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.836
Hey.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.620
It's late.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.405
Where you been?

37:13.448 --> 37:17.235
I was helping some friends
out of a jam.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.629
Yeah?

37:20.673 --> 37:23.415
Yeah.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.635
They were on a -- a mission
for the Governor's son.

37:26.679 --> 37:29.159
He's been finding
desperate people,

37:29.203 --> 37:33.294
sending them through swarms
to get stashes of cash.

37:35.296 --> 37:38.081
Most of them
didn't make it out.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.866
He sent your friends
to do this?

37:39.909 --> 37:41.433
Yeah.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.261
They all made it back,
though?

37:43.304 --> 37:44.653
Barely.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.655
Good.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.660
And the money?

37:51.704 --> 37:54.097
Did they get it?

37:54.141 --> 37:55.403
Yeah.

37:55.447 --> 37:58.101
Ah. Finally.

38:04.151 --> 38:07.459
Why -- Why did you
send the other people?

38:07.502 --> 38:09.678
W-What did they do?

38:11.114 --> 38:14.117
They put themselves
in bad situations,

38:14.161 --> 38:15.641
either through
stupid choices

38:15.684 --> 38:19.688
or an unwillingness
to play by the rules.

38:19.732 --> 38:22.125
I tried to throw them
a lifeline.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.695
Look...
this place works

38:26.739 --> 38:30.090
because everyone
plays their part.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.310
If you can't
or won't,

38:32.353 --> 38:35.487
it hurts
everyone else.

38:35.530 --> 38:36.879
That's when the system
breaks down,

38:36.923 --> 38:40.492
and we can't
let that happen.

38:40.535 --> 38:43.712
You know
what I'm saying?

38:43.756 --> 38:46.498
Yeah.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.935
Yeah, people can either be
part be of the problem

38:48.978 --> 38:51.720
or part
of the solution.

38:51.764 --> 38:55.333
I knew
you'd get it.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.509
Hmm.

38:57.552 --> 38:58.945
Well...

38:58.988 --> 39:00.947
I'll let you
get back to work.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.166
Carol.
Yeah.

39:04.777 --> 39:07.736
It's nice to be able
to talk to someone who...

39:07.780 --> 39:11.174
sees
the big picture.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.307
Not many can.
Mm.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.608
You and I, we have some
unfinished business, don't we?

39:58.221 --> 40:01.007
I tell you what.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.965
You go back
with your mom.

40:03.009 --> 40:06.012
Help her
rebuild your home.

40:06.055 --> 40:08.841
And in a few years,
when you've grown up a bit...

40:11.060 --> 40:13.019
...come find me.

40:13.062 --> 40:17.240
And I promise you,
we will settle it.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.260
What did
he say to you?

40:55.496 --> 40:58.064
What are you
gonna do?

40:58.107 --> 40:59.413
Can't go back
to Commonwealth.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.459
No,
we kinda have to.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.286
Lance is gonna want to know
what happened here.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.506
Well,
the more immediate problem

41:05.550 --> 41:07.290
is these people.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.292
It's only a matter of time
before Hornsby comes for them.

41:11.686 --> 41:13.862
Then we have to
do something.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.647
All of this
over some guns.

41:15.690 --> 41:19.302
Yeah, but if Ian didn't steal
the weapons, who did?

41:42.543 --> 41:44.502
No, no!
Please, please, please, please!

41:44.545 --> 41:46.329
No!

41:46.373 --> 41:48.549
Please,
no, no, no, please!

41:48.593 --> 41:51.117
No, please, no, no!
