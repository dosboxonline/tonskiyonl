00:48.900 --> 00:53.904
So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.
Particularly on such short notice.

00:55.073 --> 00:58.075
If you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the world come to?

00:59.285 --> 01:03.205
And now that we're all comfortable,
why don't you sit down?

01:05.248 --> 01:08.752
It was not easy,
but I have retrieved the money.

01:09.754 --> 01:12.839
No doubt, Sir Robert will be
pleased to see it again.

01:13.424 --> 01:16.385
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees

01:16.469 --> 01:19.137
and certain unforeseeable expenses.

01:20.223 --> 01:23.850
- Voilà , the receipt.
- Would you like to check my figures?

01:25.728 --> 01:27.938
Oh, I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.275
- It's all there.
- I didn't come for the money.

01:33.611 --> 01:37.781
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen
from an Ml6 agent who was killed for it.

01:41.953 --> 01:43.203
I want to know who killed him.

01:43.287 --> 01:46.039
- Terrible tragedy.
- I just want a name.

01:46.249 --> 01:49.584
I am merely the middleman.
I'm just trying to do the honorable thing,

01:49.669 --> 01:52.129
returning the money to its rightful owner.

01:52.755 --> 01:55.716
And we know how difficult that can be
for a Swiss banker.

02:01.180 --> 02:05.016
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money, Mr. Bond.

02:05.309 --> 02:08.562
And I'm giving you the opportunity
to walk out with your life.

02:08.979 --> 02:11.940
Looking at our present situation,
strictly as a banker,

02:12.024 --> 02:15.402
I would have to say
that the numbers are not on your side.

02:16.112 --> 02:21.199
Perhaps you failed to take into account
my hidden assets.

02:31.836 --> 02:34.129
You seem to have had
a small reversal of fortune.

02:35.047 --> 02:37.174
- Give me the name.
- I can't tell you.

02:37.341 --> 02:39.009
Let's count to three.

02:39.802 --> 02:45.015
You can do that, can't you? One, two...

02:46.309 --> 02:48.852
All right. All right.
But you'll have to protect me.

04:49.140 --> 04:52.475
James. Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?

04:52.935 --> 04:55.312
Chocolates? An engagement ring?

04:56.772 --> 04:58.648
I thought you'd enjoy one of these.

05:00.109 --> 05:01.359
How romantic.

05:03.946 --> 05:05.614
I know exactly where to put that.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.661
Oh, Moneypenny,

05:11.829 --> 05:16.207
the story of our relationship.
Close, but no cigar.

05:16.792 --> 05:19.336
I hate to tear you away
from affairs of state, 007.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.545
Would you mind coming in?

05:23.007 --> 05:24.341
Right away, M.

05:26.552 --> 05:28.261
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

05:29.555 --> 05:33.350
The man who retrieved my money.
I can't thank you enough. Excellent work.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.311
Be careful, M.
I might try to steal him from you.

05:36.395 --> 05:39.522
Construction's not exactly my speciality.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.524
Quite the opposite, in fact.

05:42.860 --> 05:44.110
Best to the family.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.744
- Old friend?
- We read law at Oxford together.

05:54.038 --> 05:58.083
I always knew he'd conquer the world.
Care for a drink?

05:58.376 --> 05:59.668
Yes, thank you.

06:00.878 --> 06:02.921
He's a man of great integrity.

06:03.381 --> 06:06.049
Who buys stolen reports
for three million pounds.

06:06.968 --> 06:08.051
Thank you.

06:09.303 --> 06:12.055
- Any leads on the sniper?
- Not one.

06:12.390 --> 06:15.558
Professional job.
She must be working for someone.

06:16.435 --> 06:18.812
- Is this the stolen report?
- Yes. Classified.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.814
From the Russian
Atomic Energy Department.

06:20.898 --> 06:22.482
What would King want this for?

06:23.109 --> 06:26.152
He was led to believe the document was
a secret report

06:26.237 --> 06:27.612
identifying the terrorists

06:27.697 --> 06:30.907
who'd attacked a new oil pipeline
he's building in the region.

06:31.409 --> 06:32.575
Interesting.

06:34.036 --> 06:35.203
But it doesn't exactly explain

06:35.287 --> 06:37.622
why someone would want me
out of their office alive.

06:46.298 --> 06:50.427
- King! The money.
- Moneypenny, stop King.

06:58.602 --> 07:01.062
Move! Move, move! Get out of the way!

07:05.901 --> 07:07.193
Stop!

07:44.023 --> 07:47.734
Move! Move! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move!

07:55.826 --> 07:58.953
Stop, stop! It isn't finished!

11:42.970 --> 11:44.345
What was that?

13:05.052 --> 13:06.219
Let's go!

13:06.428 --> 13:08.388
- What the hell do you think you're...
- Let go!

13:37.459 --> 13:40.420
Listen to me! You can't get away.

13:40.671 --> 13:43.131
We can make a deal.
Just tell me who's behind this.

13:43.215 --> 13:45.800
Who are you working for? Don't do it!

13:45.884 --> 13:48.678
Don't blow us up! I can protect you.

13:48.762 --> 13:51.097
Do you understand? I can protect you.

13:51.181 --> 13:52.557
Not from him!

17:20.723 --> 17:21.891
Hello, my dear.

17:34.738 --> 17:38.074
- Who is that young woman?
- King's daughter.

17:39.409 --> 17:41.911
- Elektra.
- Thank you.

17:44.915 --> 17:47.083
The money was dipped in urea.

17:48.251 --> 17:50.252
In effect, a highly compacted
fertilizer bomb.

17:50.337 --> 17:53.047
Having handled the money,
the water on 007's hands

17:53.131 --> 17:55.966
when he touched the ice
started a chemical reaction.

17:56.051 --> 17:58.803
In one of the notes,
the metal anti-counterfeiting strip

17:58.887 --> 18:01.764
had been replaced with magnesium,
which acted as a detonator.

18:01.848 --> 18:05.393
And King's lapel pin was switched for a copy

18:05.477 --> 18:09.063
which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.

18:09.147 --> 18:13.317
In other words,
he set off the bomb that killed him.

18:13.402 --> 18:15.653
We know it was someone close to King,

18:16.321 --> 18:19.031
and our only lead committed suicide
on that balloon.

18:19.533 --> 18:24.245
But given the size of King's organization,
it could be anyone, anywhere.

18:25.288 --> 18:26.288
M.

18:29.126 --> 18:30.793
This will not stand.

18:31.962 --> 18:35.297
We will not be terrorized by cowards
who'd murder an innocent man

18:35.382 --> 18:36.799
and use us as the tool.

18:37.134 --> 18:39.176
We'll find the people
who committed this atrocity.

18:39.344 --> 18:42.638
We'll follow them to the farthest ends
of the earth, if needs be.

18:43.765 --> 18:45.891
And we will bring them to justice.

18:59.489 --> 19:00.573
Tanner!

19:00.657 --> 19:02.825
Sorry, James.
M says you're off the active-duty list

19:02.909 --> 19:04.660
until you're cleared by medical.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.042
Dislocated collarbone.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.755
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid
you're going to be out of action for weeks.

19:19.468 --> 19:23.179
Molly, I need a clean bill of health.

19:24.181 --> 19:26.182
You have to clear me for duty.

19:27.017 --> 19:31.061
- James, that wouldn't really be...
- Ethical?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.899
Practical, smart.

19:35.817 --> 19:39.862
Well, let's just skirt the issue, shall we?

19:42.991 --> 19:46.452
You'd have to promise to call me this time.

19:47.329 --> 19:49.330
Whatever the doctor orders.

19:50.540 --> 19:53.334
Then I suppose,
if you stayed in constant contact...

19:53.543 --> 19:54.668
Of course.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.588
If you showed sufficient stamina.

19:58.548 --> 20:02.134
- Cut out all kinds of...
- Strenuous activity?

20:24.032 --> 20:27.284
I suppose we all have to
pay the piper sometime, right, Q?

20:27.494 --> 20:29.662
Oh, pipe down, 007.

20:30.497 --> 20:35.042
- Was it something I said?
- No. Something you destroyed.

20:35.126 --> 20:40.005
My fishing boat
for my retirement away from you.

20:42.717 --> 20:46.136
Now, I want to introduce you
to the young fellow

20:46.221 --> 20:48.430
I'm grooming to follow me.

21:00.110 --> 21:01.735
Helps if you open the door.

21:02.946 --> 21:06.323
- And you might be?
- This is 007!

21:06.533 --> 21:08.993
If you're Q, does that make him R?

21:09.077 --> 21:12.955
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.

21:13.874 --> 21:15.457
Or at least half of it.

21:15.542 --> 21:20.379
Now, I dare say, 007, that you've
met your match with this machine.

21:20.463 --> 21:23.966
Yeah? New model? Improved specs?

21:24.968 --> 21:27.970
I thought you were on the inactive roster.
Some kind of injury?

21:28.054 --> 21:30.097
Yes, well, we'll see about that. So?

21:30.181 --> 21:33.809
As I was saying, the very latest
in interception countermeasures.

21:34.144 --> 21:37.730
Titanium armor,
a multitasking heads-up display

21:37.814 --> 21:43.319
and six beverage cup holders.
All in all, rather stocked.

21:43.987 --> 21:47.489
- "Fully loaded," I think is the term.
- I think...

21:47.574 --> 21:51.160
You're not here to think.
You're here to do what I tell you.

21:51.494 --> 21:55.331
Now, go put on the coat
and demonstrate it for 007.

21:55.624 --> 21:56.999
But of course.

21:57.292 --> 22:00.127
Now, watch closely, please, 007.

22:00.962 --> 22:04.006
The right arm goes
in the right sleeve, thus.

22:04.090 --> 22:07.760
And the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.

22:07.844 --> 22:11.388
Now, note closely, please,
pockets, poppers and zipper.

22:11.848 --> 22:15.309
Take the lower part of the zipper
and insert it into the...

22:15.393 --> 22:17.019
Pull the tag.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.189
You said...

22:25.362 --> 22:27.571
He seems well-suited for the job.

22:29.908 --> 22:35.329
You're not retiring anytime soon,
are you?

22:35.705 --> 22:37.581
Now, pay attention, 007.

22:37.999 --> 22:40.209
I've always tried to teach you two things.

22:40.502 --> 22:43.295
First, never let them see you bleed.

22:44.089 --> 22:47.841
- And the second?
- Always have an escape plan.

23:01.648 --> 23:05.234
Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

23:05.694 --> 23:08.153
The Cyprus authorities say
she has escaped

23:08.238 --> 23:11.448
after shooting dead two of her captors and is...

23:15.662 --> 23:16.787
He shouted.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.458
Shouted all the time.

24:12.802 --> 24:14.636
Level one, clearance required.

24:15.847 --> 24:17.473
Level one, clearance required.

24:22.729 --> 24:23.979
Yes, 007?

24:24.564 --> 24:27.024
Tell me about the kidnapping
of Elektra King.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.651
I wasn't aware you had an assignment
on this case.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.904
I brought the money in that killed King.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.449
- Don't make this personal.
- I'm not. Are you?

24:38.870 --> 24:41.288
You're the only one who could seal her file.

24:45.043 --> 24:46.502
Will you excuse us?

24:53.510 --> 24:56.178
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.

25:03.436 --> 25:04.520
What happened?

25:07.565 --> 25:10.359
After Elektra King was kidnapped,

25:11.277 --> 25:15.864
her father tried to deal with it on his own,
with no success.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.076
So he came to me.

25:30.171 --> 25:33.715
As you are aware,
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

25:35.718 --> 25:41.890
And against every instinct in my heart,
every emotion as a mother,

25:42.392 --> 25:46.895
I told him not to pay the ransom.
I thought we had time on our side.

25:49.732 --> 25:51.483
You used the girl as bait.

25:54.279 --> 25:55.279
Yes.

25:56.156 --> 25:59.032
The money in King's briefcase
was precisely the same amount

25:59.993 --> 26:02.286
as the ransom demand for his daughter.

26:08.459 --> 26:12.880
It's a message. Your terrorist is back.

26:20.013 --> 26:25.601
- Victor Zokas, a. k.a...
- Renard, the anarchist.

26:25.768 --> 26:30.022
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.

26:30.106 --> 26:33.859
And he's been spotted
in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran,

26:33.943 --> 26:36.111
Beirut and Cambodia.

26:36.988 --> 26:41.325
- All the romantic vacation spots.
- His only goal is chaos.

26:41.784 --> 26:45.037
After Robert came to me,
I sent 009 to kill Renard.

26:45.788 --> 26:48.790
Before he completed the mission,
Elektra escaped.

26:50.001 --> 26:52.211
A week later,
our man caught up with the target.

26:52.629 --> 26:55.964
He put a bullet in his head.
That bullet's still there.

26:57.258 --> 26:58.550
How did he survive?

26:59.177 --> 27:01.678
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn't get the bullet out,

27:01.930 --> 27:03.472
so Renard killed him.

27:04.682 --> 27:07.142
It's moving through
the medulla oblongata,

27:07.227 --> 27:10.687
killing off his senses, touch, smell.

27:10.772 --> 27:12.356
He feels no pain.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.692
He can push himself harder, longer
than any normal man.

27:16.027 --> 27:17.527
The bullet will kill him,

27:17.612 --> 27:20.822
but he'll grow stronger every day,
until the day he dies.

27:25.161 --> 27:28.538
Robert is dead. Ml6 is humiliated.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.582
He's had his revenge.

27:32.460 --> 27:33.669
Not quite.

27:34.629 --> 27:37.047
Renard had three enemies in that kidnapping,

27:38.258 --> 27:40.342
and there's still one he hasn't touched.

27:42.178 --> 27:43.345
Elektra.

27:45.348 --> 27:46.348
M.

27:49.644 --> 27:53.855
I see the good doctor has cleared you.
Notes you have exceptional stamina.

27:55.191 --> 27:57.401
I'm sure she was touched
by his dedication

27:59.612 --> 28:01.321
to the job in hand.

28:03.658 --> 28:05.784
007, I want you to go to Elektra.

28:06.536 --> 28:10.455
She's taken over the construction of
her father's oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.541
Find who switched that pin.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.377
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back,

28:16.045 --> 28:17.963
and Elektra will be the next target.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.340
The worm on the hook again.

28:20.425 --> 28:23.302
She doesn't need to know
it's the same man that may be after her.

28:23.386 --> 28:24.761
Don't frighten her.

28:25.054 --> 28:26.805
A shadow operation?

28:26.931 --> 28:30.559
Remember, shadows stay
in front or behind,

28:31.352 --> 28:32.602
never on top.

29:35.083 --> 29:37.834
You, go back. Leave. This area is closed.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.920
I'm here to see Elektra King.

29:40.129 --> 29:42.297
James Bond, Universal Exports.

29:42.465 --> 29:44.841
And I'm Davidov, chief of security.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.803
As you can see, we're having
some problems with the villagers.

29:48.930 --> 29:51.932
I told Miss King to stay at the office in Baku.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.309
Oh, hell.

30:14.622 --> 30:17.666
- Miss King, I told you to stay...
- I know what you told me.

31:04.922 --> 31:06.214
Send the pipe around.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.925
It's going to take weeks and cost millions.

31:09.135 --> 31:12.721
- Your father approved this route.
- Then my father was wrong. Do it.

31:13.890 --> 31:15.599
- Davidov.
- I'll talk to her.

31:19.437 --> 31:21.646
I saw you at my father's funeral.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.399
Yes. I'm sorry.

31:25.234 --> 31:28.236
M told me she was sending someone. Mr...

31:28.905 --> 31:31.406
Bond. James Bond.

31:33.743 --> 31:37.871
- Did you know my father?
- I met him once, briefly.

31:38.789 --> 31:41.500
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.

31:41.709 --> 31:45.253
- Saving the church?
- And avoiding the bloodshed.

31:45.922 --> 31:49.549
A hundred years ago, my mother's family
discovered the oil here.

31:49.759 --> 31:52.093
When the Soviet Union was formed,

31:52.428 --> 31:56.932
the Communists spent the next 70 years
plundering our countryside for it.

31:57.767 --> 32:00.101
I saw the mess they left on the drive in.

32:00.561 --> 32:03.313
The new pipeline
will guarantee our future.

32:04.607 --> 32:08.109
But it would be a crime to destroy
what little is left of our past.

32:14.534 --> 32:17.160
But you didn't come here
to talk about oil, did you?

32:17.245 --> 32:18.245
No.

32:18.871 --> 32:20.038
Tell me,

32:23.042 --> 32:25.585
have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?

32:28.631 --> 32:31.550
M sent me because we're afraid
your life might be in danger.

32:35.471 --> 32:38.056
Please, I want to show you something.

32:38.516 --> 32:42.686
I'm trying to build an 800-mile
pipeline through Turkey,

32:43.145 --> 32:47.482
past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria.

32:47.858 --> 32:51.820
Up here, the Russians have
three competing pipelines.

32:51.904 --> 32:54.072
And they'll do anything to stop me.

32:54.490 --> 32:57.867
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting,

32:58.536 --> 33:02.998
and you, Mr. Bond, have come all this way
to tell me that I "might" be in danger?

33:06.836 --> 33:09.129
We suspect there might be an insider.

33:11.632 --> 33:14.467
- My father's pin.
- No, a duplicate

33:15.094 --> 33:18.096
with a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.

33:18.347 --> 33:21.558
My family has relied
on Ml6 twice, Mr. Bond.

33:22.018 --> 33:24.185
I won't make that mistake a third time.

33:28.024 --> 33:30.442
I'm going to finish building this pipeline,

33:30.526 --> 33:32.277
and I don't need your help.

33:32.695 --> 33:35.780
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to check the survey lines.

33:35.865 --> 33:38.283
I've always wanted to check the survey lines.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.286
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

33:41.787 --> 33:42.787
No.

33:45.374 --> 33:47.542
I hope you know how to ski, then.

33:48.878 --> 33:51.379
I came prepared for a cold reception.

34:08.731 --> 34:11.065
Can't land. Wind's too strong.

34:11.859 --> 34:12.984
Hold her steady.

35:20.511 --> 35:24.389
- You ski very well, Mr. Bond.
- Seems you enjoy being chased.

35:25.349 --> 35:29.185
- It probably happens all the time.
- Less often than you might think.

35:30.146 --> 35:33.690
So this is where they meet,
the two ends of the pipeline.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.567
Your father's legacy.

35:35.776 --> 35:39.154
My family's legacy to the world.

35:49.498 --> 35:52.000
- Expecting visitors?
- No.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.634
This isn't a social call.

36:02.136 --> 36:05.680
Head for the gully.
I'll lead them into the trees. Go, go!

38:08.178 --> 38:09.971
See you back at the lodge.

39:29.426 --> 39:30.635
- Oh, my God!
- It's all right.

39:30.719 --> 39:32.553
- We're buried alive!
- It's all right!

39:35.140 --> 39:39.227
- I can't stay here!
- You're not going to. You're not going to.

39:40.729 --> 39:42.105
- Elektra.
- I can't breathe.

39:42.189 --> 39:44.857
- Elektra, Elektra, Elektra!
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

39:44.942 --> 39:48.069
Look at me. Elektra, look at me!
Look at my eyes.

39:48.237 --> 39:51.072
Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes!

39:51.865 --> 39:53.116
You're all right.

39:54.368 --> 39:58.579
Everything's all right. Trust me. Okay?

40:27.359 --> 40:28.359
She's fine.

40:28.444 --> 40:30.695
Some bumps and bruises, but otherwise fine.

40:30.779 --> 40:33.281
She wants to see you.
Not you, Davidov, him.

40:47.546 --> 40:51.049
- Are you all right?
- I need to ask you something.

40:52.426 --> 40:54.677
And I want you to tell me the truth.

40:54.887 --> 40:58.056
Who is it? Who's trying to kill me?

40:59.099 --> 41:02.894
I told you I don't know.
But I'm gonna find him.

41:04.104 --> 41:05.313
Not good enough.

41:07.274 --> 41:09.817
After the kidnapping, I was afraid.

41:10.319 --> 41:12.737
I was afraid to go outside.
I was afraid to be alone.

41:12.821 --> 41:15.156
I was afraid to be in a crowd.

41:15.908 --> 41:17.992
I was afraid to do anything at all.

41:18.118 --> 41:22.163
Until I realized
I can't hide in the shadows.

41:22.748 --> 41:26.501
I can't let fear run my life. I won't.

41:28.003 --> 41:31.881
After I find him, you won't have to.

41:34.468 --> 41:38.012
Don't go. Stay with me.

41:40.516 --> 41:41.641
Please?

41:46.313 --> 41:47.688
I can't do that.

41:48.732 --> 41:50.817
I thought it was your job to protect me.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.864
- You'll be safe here.
- I don't want to be safe.

42:04.456 --> 42:05.998
I'll be back soon.

42:08.043 --> 42:10.545
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?

43:22.451 --> 43:26.454
- I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.
- Impossible.

43:27.748 --> 43:31.209
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

43:33.295 --> 43:35.254
Tell him James Bond is here.

43:36.673 --> 43:37.840
Now.

43:43.639 --> 43:45.556
I don't think you heard me.

43:55.359 --> 43:57.902
Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted
to see you.

44:02.783 --> 44:06.827
- After you.
- No. After you.

44:08.038 --> 44:09.789
I insist.

44:12.292 --> 44:13.876
And a little for you.

44:17.172 --> 44:18.965
Bond! James Bond!

44:19.675 --> 44:22.885
Meet Nina and Verushka.

44:24.179 --> 44:27.515
Lose the girls, Valentin. We need to talk.

44:28.016 --> 44:32.353
Why am I suddenly worried
that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

44:32.562 --> 44:33.980
Chill out, James.

44:38.402 --> 44:40.861
Fine, ladies. Go on. Beat it. Scram.

44:41.029 --> 44:42.947
Bull, give them an inch.

44:50.163 --> 44:53.040
And make sure they lose it in this casino.

44:55.210 --> 44:57.128
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.

44:57.337 --> 44:59.547
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.

45:00.382 --> 45:04.510
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.
So, what would you like to talk about?

45:05.137 --> 45:08.889
I'm not sure I can really help you.
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

45:11.268 --> 45:14.854
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest.

45:16.273 --> 45:17.606
Take a look at this.

45:20.402 --> 45:22.445
Russian Special Services.

45:23.822 --> 45:27.950
Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.
Where did you find this?

45:28.160 --> 45:31.912
I took it off a parahawk which tried to
kill Elektra King this morning.

45:32.748 --> 45:34.415
Renard is behind this.

45:39.880 --> 45:42.465
I think you and I had better have a drink.

45:48.388 --> 45:50.097
And then after Afghanistan,

45:50.182 --> 45:54.518
the KGB decided Renard was a liability
and just cut him loose.

45:54.603 --> 45:57.605
- Now he works freelance.
- But for whom?

45:59.107 --> 46:01.025
There are four competing pipelines.

46:01.234 --> 46:04.779
I'm willing to bet half the customers
in this casino would be very happy

46:04.863 --> 46:07.323
to see the King pipeline disappear.

46:09.326 --> 46:10.534
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

46:10.619 --> 46:14.121
It just appears Miss King does not share
your concern.

46:22.047 --> 46:25.883
- What are you doing here?
- The same thing you are.

46:26.009 --> 46:28.427
Looking for the people
who tried to kill me.

46:28.678 --> 46:30.805
Let me take you home. Now.

46:31.014 --> 46:33.974
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

46:34.142 --> 46:39.271
Miss King, how very nice to see you.
We've kept your father's chair free.

46:39.481 --> 46:42.274
Free?
Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky.

46:43.360 --> 46:46.862
Your father had a credit line with us,
$1 million U.S.

46:47.280 --> 46:49.824
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

46:53.912 --> 46:55.162
So what's it to be?

46:57.249 --> 46:59.333
Blackjack, your father's favorite?

47:00.210 --> 47:01.836
Let's keep it simple.

47:02.838 --> 47:05.256
One card. High draw.

47:09.177 --> 47:10.803
A million dollars.

47:14.474 --> 47:17.852
Wait. Bury the top three cards.

47:20.522 --> 47:22.606
You're determined to protect me,
aren't you?

47:22.691 --> 47:25.276
Perhaps from yourself.
You don't have to do this.

47:27.654 --> 47:31.198
There's no point in living
if you can't feel alive.

47:43.503 --> 47:44.795
Queen of hearts.

47:57.684 --> 48:02.396
It appears that you have been beaten
by the ace of clubs.

48:06.902 --> 48:09.945
No hard feelings, my dear.
Come again soon.

48:16.036 --> 48:17.286
Shall we?

48:17.579 --> 48:22.917
Elektra, this is a game I can't afford to play.

48:25.879 --> 48:27.046
I know.

48:30.342 --> 48:33.344
- What happened to Davidov?
- I gave him the night off.

48:55.784 --> 48:57.743
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.

48:59.579 --> 49:02.957
For thousands of years, Hindu pilgrims
have journeyed to this holy place

49:04.876 --> 49:08.462
to witness the wonder of the miracle
of the natural flames that never die

49:09.714 --> 49:13.634
and to test their devotion to God

49:15.303 --> 49:18.305
by holding the scalding rocks
in their hands

49:21.476 --> 49:23.185
as they said their daily prayers.

49:25.188 --> 49:28.983
Tell me, Davidov,
what happened this afternoon?

49:29.150 --> 49:33.279
You promised me your best men.
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.

49:33.405 --> 49:36.490
- Yes, but Bond...
- Bond was unarmed.

49:38.827 --> 49:42.413
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

49:42.622 --> 49:45.165
I have the authorization
and the passes in the car,

49:45.375 --> 49:47.960
and I have arranged for a plane tonight,
but...

49:48.503 --> 49:52.464
- But what?
- We should scrub the rest of the mission.

49:52.549 --> 49:55.926
The parahawks were meant to be returned.

49:56.011 --> 49:58.345
People will start asking questions,
even of me,

49:58.430 --> 50:00.764
all because of his incompetence.

50:00.849 --> 50:04.768
I see. I see you're right.
You're right, he should be punished.

50:05.770 --> 50:07.521
Davidov, hold this for me.

50:11.818 --> 50:14.278
It was wrong of me to expect
so much of you.

50:16.364 --> 50:17.531
Kill him.

50:19.868 --> 50:22.077
He failed his test of devotion.

50:25.665 --> 50:29.168
You can take his place. Take his ID.

50:31.046 --> 50:32.713
And do be on time.

50:52.692 --> 50:54.193
Poor shoulder.

50:55.403 --> 50:57.029
It looks painful.

50:59.866 --> 51:01.742
Needs constant attention.

51:05.705 --> 51:08.999
I knew. I knew when I first saw you.

51:10.752 --> 51:12.294
I knew it would be like this.

51:25.016 --> 51:26.892
Enough ice for one day.

51:47.122 --> 51:49.123
How did you survive?

51:56.464 --> 51:59.800
I seduced the guards, used my body.

52:00.802 --> 52:02.970
It gave me control.

52:04.556 --> 52:07.474
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.

52:11.271 --> 52:14.648
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?

52:19.154 --> 52:20.988
I take pleasure

52:22.741 --> 52:24.491
in great beauty.

55:03.318 --> 55:06.153
Let's go. It's getting late.

55:10.909 --> 55:14.161
What happened to Davidov?
I was told to expect him.

55:15.955 --> 55:18.248
He was buried with work.

55:19.250 --> 55:21.501
Let's go. Get your stuff.

55:33.181 --> 55:36.391
Okay, come on. Let's get out of here.

55:38.269 --> 55:42.689
You're late. Did you bring it? The grease.

55:46.027 --> 55:47.569
Of course.

55:54.494 --> 55:55.494
Excellent.

56:13.262 --> 56:15.931
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.

56:16.015 --> 56:17.933
But make sure you wear the ID.

57:04.313 --> 57:06.023
I'm gonna go get some air.

57:23.791 --> 57:27.502
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.

57:28.212 --> 57:31.298
Not often we see someone
of your stature here.

57:31.382 --> 57:33.633
I go where the work takes me.

57:33.718 --> 57:36.094
By the way,
you have the transport documents?

57:45.855 --> 57:48.315
I pulled the plutonium out of the one inside.

57:48.399 --> 57:50.984
- You can detonate the triggers now.
- Okay.

57:54.655 --> 57:59.993
Look. Our IDA physicist.
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

58:00.078 --> 58:01.703
Take my word for it.

58:01.788 --> 58:03.872
Last year,
we decommissioned four test sites.

58:03.956 --> 58:06.041
Not even a glimmer.

58:10.338 --> 58:14.007
Are you here for a reason
or are you just hoping for a glimmer?

58:14.759 --> 58:16.093
And you are?

58:16.177 --> 58:19.846
Mikhail Arkov,
Russian Atomic Energy Department.

58:19.931 --> 58:24.768
- Miss...
- Dr. Jones. Christmas Jones.

58:24.852 --> 58:28.021
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard them all.

58:28.106 --> 58:30.315
I don't know any doctor jokes.

58:32.443 --> 58:35.278
This is okay.
Take the elevator down the hall.

58:35.363 --> 58:37.531
Your friends are already down there.

58:37.615 --> 58:41.785
- Don't I get some type of protection?
- No, Dr. Arkov.

58:41.869 --> 58:43.745
Down there it's all
weapons-grade plutonium.

58:43.830 --> 58:45.122
Reasonably safe.

58:45.206 --> 58:47.415
Up here we've got hydrogen bombs
that your lab built

58:47.500 --> 58:48.458
leaking tritium,

58:48.543 --> 58:50.961
which I've spent the last six months
trying to clean up.

58:51.045 --> 58:53.338
So if you need any protection at all,
it's from me.

58:56.551 --> 58:58.051
Your friends are waiting for you.

59:04.225 --> 59:05.225
Doctor?

59:07.770 --> 59:09.229
Aren't you forgetting?

59:12.567 --> 59:14.276
Yes, of course. Thank you.

59:15.069 --> 59:16.403
By the way...

01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:40.320
Expecting Davidov?
He caught a bullet instead of the plane.

01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:44.324
Get off. Keep your mouth shut.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:46.326
You can't kill me, I'm already dead.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:49.579
Yeah, not dead enough for me.

01:00:50.164 --> 01:00:54.751
You could show a little gratitude,
I did spare your life at the banker's office.

01:00:55.336 --> 01:00:59.839
That's right. I couldn't kill you.
You were working for me.

01:01:00.299 --> 01:01:04.177
You delivered the money, killed King,
and now you brought me the plane.

01:01:04.845 --> 01:01:08.223
- What's your plan for the bomb?
- You first.

01:01:08.516 --> 01:01:12.936
- Or could it be you don't have a plan?
- That bomb will never leave this room.

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.605
Neither will you.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.865
How sad to be threatened by a man
who can't grasp what he's involved in.

01:01:26.534 --> 01:01:29.661
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who believes in nothing.

01:01:29.745 --> 01:01:33.164
And what do you believe in?
Preservation of capital?

01:01:33.249 --> 01:01:36.584
Go ahead, shoot me. I'll welcome it.

01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:39.587
My men will hear the shot and kill you.

01:01:39.672 --> 01:01:42.590
And the firefight will bring down
half the army from above.

01:01:42.883 --> 01:01:46.219
But when a certain phone call
isn't made in 20 minutes,

01:01:46.304 --> 01:01:47.595
Elektra dies.

01:01:50.224 --> 01:01:54.144
- You're bluffing.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:58.690
You should have had her before,
when she was innocent.

01:01:59.442 --> 01:02:03.403
How does it feel
to know I broke her in for you?

01:02:05.448 --> 01:02:07.949
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:10.035
Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.

01:02:10.119 --> 01:02:12.454
A man tires of being executed.

01:02:13.539 --> 01:02:17.167
But in your case, I feel nothing,
just like you.

01:02:17.376 --> 01:02:21.087
But then again, there's no point living
if you can't feel alive.

01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:25.675
Hey!

01:02:26.427 --> 01:02:28.595
- Drop the gun!
- Keep away, Colonel.

01:02:28.804 --> 01:02:31.681
He's an impostor.
Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.

01:02:31.766 --> 01:02:35.560
This is your impostor,
along with the men outside on the plane.

01:02:35.644 --> 01:02:37.437
They're stealing the bomb.

01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:40.857
I said drop it!

01:02:51.744 --> 01:02:52.827
On your knees!

01:02:56.207 --> 01:02:57.332
Well done.

01:02:59.293 --> 01:03:02.962
He would've killed us all.
Did you speak to him?

01:03:03.047 --> 01:03:05.632
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

01:03:07.134 --> 01:03:09.636
I suppose you were the one
who allowed him down.

01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:20.105
You had me,

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.652
but I knew you couldn't
shoulder the responsibility.

01:03:32.034 --> 01:03:34.327
Now, without any further interruptions,
let's proceed.

01:03:34.703 --> 01:03:37.247
There are too many new faces around here,

01:03:37.331 --> 01:03:39.499
including yours.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.836
The bomb doesn't move
until I am satisfied.

01:03:43.295 --> 01:03:46.172
Hey, all of you, to the surface, now.

01:04:08.362 --> 01:04:09.446
Come on! Go!

01:04:12.074 --> 01:04:13.199
Move!

01:04:20.207 --> 01:04:21.541
They're sealing us in.

01:04:24.044 --> 01:04:25.211
Who are you?

01:04:26.338 --> 01:04:28.214
I work for the British government.

01:04:33.179 --> 01:04:34.304
Stay calm.

01:06:38.012 --> 01:06:41.556
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond, but we're even.

01:06:42.016 --> 01:06:45.143
Soon, you'll feel nothing at all.

01:07:11.545 --> 01:07:14.255
Seal the door! Close it!

01:07:26.685 --> 01:07:27.935
Come on!

01:07:48.916 --> 01:07:51.042
Keep going! Move! Hang on!

01:07:51.794 --> 01:07:54.003
So, you're a British spy.
Do you have a name?

01:07:54.088 --> 01:07:55.254
The name's Bond.

01:08:00.636 --> 01:08:01.928
James Bond.

01:08:12.314 --> 01:08:14.440
Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!

01:08:35.504 --> 01:08:37.130
They won't get very far.

01:08:37.296 --> 01:08:40.633
Every warhead has a locator card.
We can track the signal.

01:08:42.469 --> 01:08:44.136
You mean one of these?

01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:53.938
Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

01:08:54.148 --> 01:08:55.814
Anywhere in this circle.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:59.569
Russia, Armenia, Iran,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan...

01:08:59.653 --> 01:09:02.279
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Elektra King is calling from Baku.

01:09:02.363 --> 01:09:05.366
- It's on the video line.
- Put her on the wall screen.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:14.751
I'm sorry. I would never call you,
except James has disappeared.

01:09:15.544 --> 01:09:17.627
He left my villa in the middle of the night,

01:09:17.712 --> 01:09:23.426
and my head of security has been found

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:26.261
near your local airstrip, murdered.

01:09:27.221 --> 01:09:30.515
- I'll send someone out.
- M, could you come?

01:09:31.977 --> 01:09:35.688
I can't help thinking I'm next.

01:09:40.194 --> 01:09:41.402
- Get me out there.
- No, listen...

01:09:41.487 --> 01:09:43.779
Just get me out there.

01:10:02.132 --> 01:10:03.257
Gabor?

01:10:11.558 --> 01:10:12.558
James?

01:10:15.103 --> 01:10:16.312
Surprised?

01:10:16.772 --> 01:10:18.898
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:21.901
Maybe. Maybe I should ask you.

01:10:22.903 --> 01:10:27.156
After all, "there's no point in living
if you can't feel alive."

01:10:27.241 --> 01:10:29.909
Isn't that right, Elektra?
Isnâ€™t that your motto?

01:10:30.077 --> 01:10:31.118
What are you talking about?

01:10:31.203 --> 01:10:32.328
Or did you steal it

01:10:32.412 --> 01:10:34.455
- from your old friend Renard?
- What?

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.040
He and I had a chat this morning.

01:10:36.124 --> 01:10:38.459
Knew all about us.
Knew about my shoulder.

01:10:38.544 --> 01:10:40.086
Knew exactly where to hurt me.

01:10:40.254 --> 01:10:42.797
Are you saying Renard is the man
who's trying to kill me?

01:10:42.881 --> 01:10:43.965
Drop the act.

01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:46.425
It's over.

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:51.013
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.

01:10:53.267 --> 01:10:55.351
It's called Stockholm syndrome,

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.396
common in kidnappings.

01:10:58.897 --> 01:11:02.859
Young, impressionable victim. Sheltered.

01:11:04.444 --> 01:11:06.946
Sexually inexperienced.

01:11:07.447 --> 01:11:11.284
A powerful kidnapper
skilled in torture, manipulation.

01:11:12.661 --> 01:11:14.996
Something snaps in the victim's mind.

01:11:15.873 --> 01:11:17.748
The captive falls in love with her captor.

01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:19.333
How dare you?

01:11:20.335 --> 01:11:23.296
How dare you?
That animal? That monster?

01:11:23.964 --> 01:11:25.798
He disgusts me.

01:11:26.842 --> 01:11:28.551
You disgust me.

01:11:29.469 --> 01:11:32.346
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?

01:11:32.598 --> 01:11:34.974
You had a sling on your arm
at the funeral.

01:11:35.475 --> 01:11:38.269
And I didn't have to sleep with you
to find that out.

01:11:38.478 --> 01:11:41.314
- He used your exact words.
- So you knew.

01:11:41.982 --> 01:11:43.399
You knew all the time
that he was out there,

01:11:43.483 --> 01:11:45.067
that he was coming for me,

01:11:45.152 --> 01:11:46.360
and you lied.

01:11:47.195 --> 01:11:48.654
You used me.

01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:51.157
You used me as bait.

01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:56.370
And you made love to me.

01:11:58.290 --> 01:11:59.498
What?

01:12:00.167 --> 01:12:03.502
To pass the time
as you waited for him to strike?

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:10.593
Hello?

01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:19.393
He's struck again.
Ten men are dead at the pipeline.

01:12:19.561 --> 01:12:20.853
I'm coming with you.

01:12:22.022 --> 01:12:24.732
You do what you want to do,
but I've called M.

01:12:25.943 --> 01:12:27.985
She's coming to take charge.

01:12:42.501 --> 01:12:43.793
Oh, no.

01:12:57.724 --> 01:13:00.142
I want an update. Where do we stand?

01:13:01.061 --> 01:13:04.230
One of Renard's men removed
the locator card from the bomb

01:13:04.398 --> 01:13:05.898
so we can't track it. But...

01:13:06.066 --> 01:13:07.316
But what?

01:13:07.985 --> 01:13:09.360
With all due respect,

01:13:10.237 --> 01:13:12.071
I don't think you should be here.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.575
May I remind you
that you're the reason I'm here, 007.

01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:19.453
You disobeyed a direct order
and left that girl alone.

01:13:19.538 --> 01:13:22.540
Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent
as you think.

01:13:22.624 --> 01:13:25.292
- What are you saying?
- Suppose the inside man,

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:30.131
the one who switched King's lapel pin,
turned out to be an inside woman?

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:35.636
She kills her father
and attacks her own pipeline?

01:13:35.721 --> 01:13:38.097
- Why? To what end?
- I don't know, yet.

01:13:44.438 --> 01:13:46.355
Rig Station 11- RS

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.858
Look at that. That's not right.

01:13:49.985 --> 01:13:53.029
- What is it?
- An observation rig.

01:13:53.238 --> 01:13:56.824
- Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.
- Shut it down.

01:13:59.494 --> 01:14:02.204
I don't understand. It won't respond.

01:14:02.622 --> 01:14:04.540
The place is clean. No sign of the bomb.

01:14:04.624 --> 01:14:07.209
- The bomb is in the pipeline.
- Oh, my God!

01:14:07.294 --> 01:14:10.129
They must have brought it through here.
That would explain the attack.

01:14:10.297 --> 01:14:11.672
Heading for the oil terminal.

01:14:11.757 --> 01:14:13.632
Where it would do the most damage.

01:14:13.717 --> 01:14:15.718
Have your men evacuate that terminal.

01:14:17.971 --> 01:14:19.638
So now do you believe me?

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.894
This is an emergency situation.
So, please,

01:14:24.978 --> 01:14:26.812
clear the room. Do it.

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.689
- He's going for the oil.
- Of course.

01:14:29.274 --> 01:14:31.108
The one pipeline the West is counting on

01:14:31.193 --> 01:14:34.320
to supply our reserves
for the next century.

01:14:34.404 --> 01:14:36.989
- Do you have an idea?
- Maybe.

01:14:37.991 --> 01:14:41.077
How far is that rig from the terminal?
And how fast is it traveling?

01:14:41.661 --> 01:14:46.082
It's 106 miles from the terminal,
going 70 miles an hour.

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.417
We've got 78 minutes.
Do you have another rig?

01:14:48.502 --> 01:14:51.212
There's one parked in the passageway
ahead of it.

01:14:51.505 --> 01:14:54.215
- Charles, can you get me out there?
- Of course.

01:14:55.342 --> 01:14:56.425
Wait a minute.

01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:58.219
Are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

01:14:58.303 --> 01:15:01.514
- What do I need to defuse a nuclear bomb?
- Me.

01:15:14.194 --> 01:15:17.071
There it is. Hatch to the passageway.

01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:22.993
Take the controls.

01:15:23.078 --> 01:15:25.246
You keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.

01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:27.540
- I'll be waiting to hear from you.
- Gotcha.

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:29.875
You know how to drive
one of these things?

01:15:30.043 --> 01:15:33.170
Doesn't exactly take a degree
in nuclear physics.

01:15:41.555 --> 01:15:44.640
They're in the pipeline.
They're on the move.

01:16:01.408 --> 01:16:02.575
Faster!

01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:13.419
If there's even the slightest chance,
Bond will succeed.

01:16:13.587 --> 01:16:17.298
He's the best we have,
though I'd never tell him.

01:16:18.842 --> 01:16:20.342
I hope you're right.

01:16:24.055 --> 01:16:25.389
Here it comes!

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:31.854
It's closing up. Faster!

01:16:37.444 --> 01:16:38.944
Sit tight.

01:16:54.461 --> 01:16:56.462
No brakes! The controls are jammed!

01:17:10.936 --> 01:17:14.813
It's a tactical fission device, low yield.
Hold me steady.

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:17.691
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

01:17:17.901 --> 01:17:20.152
Yeah, but they're usually standing still.

01:17:20.237 --> 01:17:23.197
Yeah, well, life's full of small challenges.

01:17:25.283 --> 01:17:28.452
Have a look at this.
Someone stripped the screw heads.

01:17:29.996 --> 01:17:31.789
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

01:17:52.185 --> 01:17:54.853
Look, half the plutonium's missing.

01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:58.399
So what are you saying?
It couldn't go nuclear?

01:17:58.483 --> 01:18:01.068
There's still enough explosive in there
to kill both of us

01:18:01.152 --> 01:18:02.653
if the trigger charge goes off.

01:18:02.737 --> 01:18:04.571
- Let it blow.
- But I can stop it.

01:18:04.656 --> 01:18:05.698
Let it blow!

01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:13.163
Trust me! Leave it!

01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:18.877
Move down. Move down!

01:18:19.087 --> 01:18:20.546
Jump! Go on, jump!

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:24.717
Jump!

01:18:39.232 --> 01:18:40.899
Robinson's reporting.

01:18:41.401 --> 01:18:43.402
The bomb was a dud.

01:18:44.404 --> 01:18:47.823
But the triggering charge blew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.

01:18:48.033 --> 01:18:49.116
And Bond?

01:18:50.201 --> 01:18:51.201
Nothing.

01:18:53.038 --> 01:18:54.580
I'm so sorry.

01:18:57.459 --> 01:18:59.209
But I have a gift for you.

01:19:00.003 --> 01:19:04.465
Something that belonged to my father.
He would've wanted you to have it.

01:19:05.592 --> 01:19:08.844
- Perhaps this isn't the time.
- Please.

01:19:10.347 --> 01:19:14.433
He often spoke of how compassionately
you advised him

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:17.811
on the best course of action
during my kidnapping.

01:19:21.775 --> 01:19:23.442
It's very valuable, you know.

01:19:24.277 --> 01:19:27.112
I just couldn't let it explode
with the rest of him.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.371
I was very upset when the money
didn't kill both of you.

01:19:36.164 --> 01:19:38.499
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

01:19:39.334 --> 01:19:42.586
Then you dropped the answer
right in my lap.

01:19:43.088 --> 01:19:47.549
Bond. And as you say,
he's the best you have.

01:19:47.634 --> 01:19:49.635
Or should I say, "had"?

01:19:56.142 --> 01:19:57.684
Take her to the helicopter.

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:06.944
Come on, give me your hand.
Jump, jump, jump!

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.697
Do you wanna explain why you did that?

01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:13.325
I could've stopped that bomb.
You almost killed us.

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.035
I did kill us.

01:20:15.662 --> 01:20:18.997
She thinks we're dead,
and she thinks she got away with it.

01:20:19.165 --> 01:20:22.626
Do you wanna put that in English for
those of us who don't speak "spy"?

01:20:22.836 --> 01:20:25.295
- Who's "she"?
- Elektra King.

01:20:25.505 --> 01:20:27.756
Well, why would she blow up
her own pipeline?

01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:29.341
It makes her look innocent.

01:20:31.177 --> 01:20:33.762
The explosion covers up
the theft of the plutonium.

01:20:35.682 --> 01:20:37.433
And they make it look
like a terrorist attack.

01:20:37.517 --> 01:20:39.768
But why leave this half?

01:20:40.145 --> 01:20:43.772
So there's enough to spread around
to cover up for the part that they did take.

01:20:43.898 --> 01:20:45.941
But what are they gonna do
with the other half?

01:20:46.192 --> 01:20:48.652
It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.

01:20:48.862 --> 01:20:51.613
- You're the scientist, you tell me.
- I don't know.

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.367
But the world's greatest terrorist
running around with six kilos

01:20:55.452 --> 01:20:57.744
of weapons-grade plutonium
can't be good.

01:20:58.037 --> 01:21:00.539
I have to get it back,
or somebody's gonna have my ass.

01:21:03.376 --> 01:21:04.751
First things first.

01:21:07.005 --> 01:21:08.922
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?

01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:13.427
By the way, before we go any further,
I just wanna know,

01:21:14.721 --> 01:21:20.017
- what's the story with you and Elektra?
- We're strictly platonic. Now.

01:21:20.226 --> 01:21:22.102
Bond to Robinson. Copy?

01:21:24.772 --> 01:21:28.817
What's your story?
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:32.196
Avoiding those kind of questions,
just like you.

01:21:32.739 --> 01:21:35.324
I read you, 007. Red alert.

01:21:35.533 --> 01:21:37.659
M is missing with Elektra.
Three men down.

01:21:37.869 --> 01:21:39.745
Await instructions. Out.

01:21:41.289 --> 01:21:42.289
What do we do now?

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.296
There's one critical element here
I may have overlooked.

01:21:49.547 --> 01:21:51.465
- What? More plutonium?
- No.

01:21:52.258 --> 01:21:54.051
Beluga.

01:21:54.135 --> 01:21:55.385
Caviar.

01:22:25.166 --> 01:22:26.542
Brought me something?

01:22:32.674 --> 01:22:34.967
The power to reshape the world.

01:22:38.388 --> 01:22:41.265
Go on. It's safe.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.850
Touch your destiny.

01:22:57.865 --> 01:23:00.450
I have brought something for you, as well.

01:23:06.916 --> 01:23:11.253
Your present,
courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.

01:23:12.213 --> 01:23:15.340
- My executioner.
- Overpraise, I'm afraid.

01:23:16.217 --> 01:23:19.136
- But my people will finish the job.
- Your people?

01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:25.017
Your people will leave you here to rot
just like you left me.

01:23:26.019 --> 01:23:27.311
You and my father.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.563
- Your father wasn't...
- My father was nothing.

01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:32.691
His kingdom, he stole from my mother.

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:36.528
The kingdom I will rightly take back.

01:23:45.496 --> 01:23:47.956
I hope you're proud
of what you did to her.

01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:51.752
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

01:23:53.338 --> 01:23:57.090
When I took her, she was promise itself,

01:23:58.051 --> 01:24:00.636
and you left her at the mercy
of a man like me.

01:24:01.804 --> 01:24:03.430
You ruined her.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.475
For what? To get to me?

01:24:07.393 --> 01:24:10.395
- She's worth 50 of me.
- For once, I agree with you.

01:24:12.732 --> 01:24:17.069
Yes. And now we also share
a common fate.

01:24:18.237 --> 01:24:21.531
You will die,
along with everyone in this city

01:24:23.534 --> 01:24:27.579
and the bright, starry, oil-driven
future of the West.

01:24:34.087 --> 01:24:39.007
Since you sent your man to kill me,
I've been watching time tick slowly away,

01:24:40.093 --> 01:24:41.885
marching toward my own death.

01:24:45.848 --> 01:24:47.766
Now you can have the same pleasure.

01:24:52.146 --> 01:24:53.897
Watch these hands, M.

01:24:54.941 --> 01:24:58.610
By noon tomorrow, your time is up.

01:25:00.196 --> 01:25:03.782
And I guarantee you, I will not miss.

01:25:26.723 --> 01:25:28.265
So beautiful.

01:25:29.851 --> 01:25:31.268
So smooth.

01:25:32.645 --> 01:25:34.104
So warm.

01:25:35.022 --> 01:25:36.606
How would you know?

01:25:41.946 --> 01:25:46.158
Why are you like this?
Because Bond is dead?

01:25:47.827 --> 01:25:52.080
- It's what you wanted.
- Of course it's what I wanted.

01:25:57.670 --> 01:25:58.837
He was...

01:26:02.133 --> 01:26:03.425
He was a good lover?

01:26:04.302 --> 01:26:07.345
What do you think?
I wouldn't feel anything?

01:26:22.528 --> 01:26:24.029
I feel nothing.

01:26:40.046 --> 01:26:41.379
What about this?

01:26:52.558 --> 01:26:57.854
But surely, you can feel this?

01:27:05.071 --> 01:27:10.200
Remember pleasure?

01:27:57.874 --> 01:27:58.957
Wait here.

01:27:59.959 --> 01:28:04.129
Always something.
First the casino, now the caviar factory.

01:28:04.797 --> 01:28:07.424
I am a slave to the free-market economy.

01:28:20.938 --> 01:28:21.938
Hello?

01:28:24.108 --> 01:28:25.609
Bond is alive.

01:28:30.823 --> 01:28:33.116
Is nothing in this place straight?

01:28:38.164 --> 01:28:41.374
Who are you? And how did you get in?

01:28:42.001 --> 01:28:45.629
I'll call security and congratulate them.

01:28:46.547 --> 01:28:47.839
Drink?

01:28:50.843 --> 01:28:53.428
Can't you just say hello
like a normal person?

01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:56.431
Get lost.

01:28:57.183 --> 01:28:59.809
No, no, no. Down the back.

01:29:02.188 --> 01:29:03.855
What's your business with Elektra King?

01:29:04.857 --> 01:29:08.318
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.

01:29:08.402 --> 01:29:11.821
She drops $1 million in your casino,
and you don't even blink an eye.

01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:13.865
What's she paying you off for?

01:29:15.034 --> 01:29:18.536
You know, if I were you,
a relationship with a man like that,

01:29:18.663 --> 01:29:19.913
I wouldn't bet on it.

01:29:24.377 --> 01:29:26.628
$5000 of beluga ruined.

01:29:26.712 --> 01:29:29.839
That's nothing compared to what a
20-megaton nuclear bomb can do.

01:29:29.924 --> 01:29:30.966
What are you talking about?

01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.218
We had a nuclear bomb
stolen this morning.

01:29:33.302 --> 01:29:35.637
Renard and Elektra King
are working together.

01:29:35.763 --> 01:29:37.514
- I didn't know.
- Well, what do you know?

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.326
Q's not gonna like this.

01:33:20.905 --> 01:33:22.780
Hide!

01:33:33.584 --> 01:33:34.667
Get out!

01:34:46.282 --> 01:34:47.323
Help!

01:34:47.408 --> 01:34:49.784
Now, where were we?

01:34:49.868 --> 01:34:52.662
- A rope, please!
- No. The truth.

01:34:52.746 --> 01:34:53.830
She has M.

01:34:53.914 --> 01:34:56.708
- I know nothing about that.
- Those blades were meant for you.

01:34:56.792 --> 01:34:59.168
What does Elektra King
want you dead for?

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.299
It was you who destroyed my factory,
then you drown my Rolls-Royce,

01:35:04.383 --> 01:35:07.885
and now you're trying to drown me
in my own caviar!

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.595
Let me out!

01:35:10.055 --> 01:35:12.932
Too bad we don't have any champagne.

01:35:13.017 --> 01:35:14.267
Or sour cream.

01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:15.810
Okay, okay.

01:35:17.604 --> 01:35:23.609
Occasionally, I get equipment for her.
Machinery. You know, Russian stuff.

01:35:23.736 --> 01:35:25.445
And the payoff in the casino?

01:35:25.946 --> 01:35:27.196
It was a special job.

01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:29.741
My nephew is in the navy.

01:35:31.118 --> 01:35:34.329
He's smuggling some machinery for her.

01:35:34.538 --> 01:35:36.247
- Where?
- Absolutely not!

01:35:36.332 --> 01:35:37.373
Where?

01:35:40.961 --> 01:35:43.546
- Where?
- Istanbul!

01:35:52.931 --> 01:35:56.309
You! Where have you been,
you gold-encrusted buffoon?

01:35:56.393 --> 01:35:59.103
Sorry, boss. I must have bumped my head.

01:35:59.271 --> 01:36:00.897
Oh, really? Get me out of here,

01:36:00.981 --> 01:36:03.358
I'll show you
what a bumped head feels like.

01:36:03.442 --> 01:36:07.695
Look. We have no roof,
but at least we have four good walls.

01:36:20.292 --> 01:36:24.253
The insurance company
is never going to believe this.

01:37:25.607 --> 01:37:28.693
This used to be
the KGB's Istanbul safe house.

01:37:28.777 --> 01:37:31.946
Now it's FSB. Federal Security Bureau.

01:37:32.156 --> 01:37:34.824
Same old friendly service
with a new name.

01:37:35.242 --> 01:37:37.285
- Did you raise Nikoli?
- Nothing.

01:37:37.369 --> 01:37:39.912
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.

01:37:41.665 --> 01:37:42.707
Tragedy.

01:37:43.167 --> 01:37:46.127
In the old days,
there were at least a hundred places

01:37:46.211 --> 01:37:48.296
where a submarine
could surface undetected.

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:49.464
Submarine?

01:37:50.215 --> 01:37:52.175
What class is your nephew running?

01:37:54.178 --> 01:37:56.137
- Victor III, you call it.
- Nuclear.

01:37:56.221 --> 01:37:59.015
He's not loading cargo. They want the sub.
They want to use the reactor.

01:37:59.099 --> 01:38:00.141
That's it.

01:38:00.225 --> 01:38:03.144
Put weapons-grade plutonium
in that sub's reactor,

01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:05.646
instant catastrophic meltdown.

01:38:05.856 --> 01:38:07.899
Making it all look just like an accident.

01:38:08.859 --> 01:38:10.067
But why?

01:38:10.736 --> 01:38:16.240
Because the existing pipelines from
the Caspian Sea go to the north. Here.

01:38:16.742 --> 01:38:20.912
The oil is put onboard the tankers, shipped
across the Black Sea, down to Istanbul.

01:38:21.663 --> 01:38:26.918
The explosion would destroy Istanbul,
contaminating the Bosporus for decades.

01:38:28.086 --> 01:38:30.213
And there'd be only one way
to get the oil out.

01:38:30.422 --> 01:38:34.133
Yeah, down south to the Med.
The King pipeline.

01:38:34.551 --> 01:38:35.635
Elektra's pipeline.

01:38:36.136 --> 01:38:37.929
We must find Nikoli.

01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:41.265
Captain Nikoli?

01:38:43.393 --> 01:38:44.477
Sir.

01:38:45.395 --> 01:38:46.938
Ready to load your cargo.

01:38:47.147 --> 01:38:49.065
We have only a few hours
before we'll be missed.

01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:50.191
You came with a skeleton crew?

01:38:50.275 --> 01:38:52.276
- Yeah, that's all we can afford these days.
- Of course.

01:38:52.945 --> 01:38:55.279
Some brandy and refreshments
for your men.

01:38:57.282 --> 01:38:58.366
Thank you.

01:39:03.622 --> 01:39:04.789
Good morning.

01:39:09.419 --> 01:39:10.753
What's the time?

01:39:24.351 --> 01:39:26.310
It's time for you to die.

01:39:58.927 --> 01:40:00.344
I've got something

01:40:01.305 --> 01:40:03.055
on the emergency frequency.

01:40:03.265 --> 01:40:05.850
Two six-digit numbers cycled
every 15 seconds.

01:40:06.018 --> 01:40:09.979
- A GPS signal. Position coordinates.
- Locator card. M.

01:40:13.358 --> 01:40:15.276
- Here.
- Yeah. Maiden's Tower.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.029
- Have you been there?
- No. No. Mr. Bullion.

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.326
Bomb!

01:40:30.208 --> 01:40:31.626
Come on, come on, come on.

01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:48.684
After you. I insist.

01:41:05.744 --> 01:41:07.662
Enjoyed your meal, boys?

01:41:15.545 --> 01:41:17.672
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

01:41:30.018 --> 01:41:31.602
The extruder's in here.

01:41:33.063 --> 01:41:37.024
It will take me half an hour to set up
the machine to make the plutonium rod.

01:41:43.865 --> 01:41:45.282
Put them in here.

01:41:54.835 --> 01:41:58.462
The reactor is secured.
Everything is complete as planned.

01:42:01.216 --> 01:42:04.969
- Is your helicopter ready?
- It's going to pick me up in half an hour.

01:42:08.473 --> 01:42:10.015
Then this is the end.

01:42:10.267 --> 01:42:13.060
No. This is the beginning.

01:42:14.688 --> 01:42:16.480
The world will never be the same.

01:42:30.162 --> 01:42:34.373
The future is yours. Have fun with it.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.257
James Bond.

01:42:51.767 --> 01:42:53.100
If only you'd kept away,

01:42:53.185 --> 01:42:56.604
we might have met again in a few years
and become lovers once more.

01:43:06.198 --> 01:43:07.698
Take her to Renard.

01:43:10.494 --> 01:43:13.871
Pretty thing. You had her, too?

01:43:19.169 --> 01:43:21.045
I could've given you the world.

01:43:22.506 --> 01:43:24.089
The world is not enough.

01:43:25.008 --> 01:43:28.052
- Foolish sentiment.
- Family motto.

01:43:31.348 --> 01:43:35.726
They were digging near here,
and they found some very pretty vases.

01:43:36.937 --> 01:43:39.104
They also found this chair.

01:43:49.783 --> 01:43:53.869
I think we ignore the old ways
at our peril, don't you?

01:43:54.871 --> 01:43:58.457
- Where's M?
- Soon, she'll be everywhere.

01:44:00.085 --> 01:44:04.588
All this because you fell for Renard?

01:44:07.884 --> 01:44:10.845
Five more turns and your neck will break.

01:44:14.307 --> 01:44:16.809
I've always had a power over men.

01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:23.357
When I realized my father wouldn't
rescue me from the kidnappers,

01:44:23.775 --> 01:44:26.443
I knew I had to form another alliance.

01:44:27.821 --> 01:44:31.282
You turned Renard.

01:44:32.826 --> 01:44:37.580
Just like you, only you were even easier.

01:44:41.334 --> 01:44:45.296
I told him he had to hurt me.
He had to make it look real.

01:44:46.590 --> 01:44:51.886
When he refused,
I told him I would do it myself.

01:44:56.349 --> 01:44:59.560
So you killed your father.

01:45:00.729 --> 01:45:01.979
He killed me.

01:45:03.690 --> 01:45:06.025
He killed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.

01:45:06.318 --> 01:45:08.611
Was this all about the oil?

01:45:10.363 --> 01:45:12.156
It is my oil.

01:45:12.949 --> 01:45:15.492
Mine and my family's.

01:45:15.827 --> 01:45:18.996
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.

01:45:20.165 --> 01:45:22.541
I'm going to redraw the map.

01:45:22.792 --> 01:45:26.086
And when I'm through,
the whole world will know my name,

01:45:26.296 --> 01:45:29.506
my grandfather's name,
the glory of my people!

01:45:29.591 --> 01:45:32.801
No one will believe this meltdown
was an accident.

01:45:33.303 --> 01:45:35.763
They will believe. They will all believe.

01:45:36.806 --> 01:45:40.434
You understand? Nobody can resist me.

01:45:45.398 --> 01:45:48.442
You know what happens
when a man is strangled?

01:45:48.526 --> 01:45:51.904
Elektra, it's not too late.

01:45:53.907 --> 01:45:56.700
Eight million people need not die.

01:45:58.536 --> 01:46:01.205
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

01:46:02.332 --> 01:46:05.501
But you couldn't. Not me.
Not a woman you've loved.

01:46:15.929 --> 01:46:18.430
You meant nothing to me.

01:46:23.895 --> 01:46:29.942
One last screw.

01:46:30.068 --> 01:46:31.735
Oh, James.

01:46:55.093 --> 01:46:59.596
Boss, you're alive. So glad to see you.

01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:01.515
Me too.

01:47:07.564 --> 01:47:09.148
I'm looking for a submarine.

01:47:09.232 --> 01:47:12.443
It's big and black, and the driver
is a very good friend of mine.

01:47:17.490 --> 01:47:19.450
Bring it to me.

01:47:20.744 --> 01:47:23.620
What a shame. He's just gone.

01:48:11.795 --> 01:48:13.879
Zukovsky really hated you.

01:48:15.632 --> 01:48:18.342
Everything's under control up here.
Are you ready?

01:48:25.475 --> 01:48:27.101
Time to say good night.

01:48:55.964 --> 01:48:59.633
James, you can't kill me,
not in cold blood.

01:49:06.432 --> 01:49:07.724
Bond!

01:49:29.247 --> 01:49:30.414
Call him off.

01:49:37.547 --> 01:49:39.089
I won't ask again.

01:49:40.425 --> 01:49:44.094
Call him off. Call him off!

01:49:48.808 --> 01:49:50.058
Renard.

01:49:54.856 --> 01:49:58.150
You wouldn't kill me. You'd miss me.

01:50:00.612 --> 01:50:01.612
Yes.

01:50:02.655 --> 01:50:04.573
Dive! Bond...

01:50:10.163 --> 01:50:11.496
I never miss.

01:51:19.732 --> 01:51:21.024
Where is she?

01:51:39.043 --> 01:51:40.043
James!

01:51:40.795 --> 01:51:43.005
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?

01:52:15.246 --> 01:52:18.623
Level at 100 feet. Hold her steady.

01:52:29.427 --> 01:52:30.802
Level at 100 feet.

01:52:36.267 --> 01:52:40.729
If we can force them up to the surface,
they'll show up on the spy satellite,

01:52:41.105 --> 01:52:42.606
bring out the navy.

01:52:52.992 --> 01:52:54.451
Come on. Get up!

01:52:54.619 --> 01:52:56.328
Over there. Go! Move!

01:52:56.412 --> 01:52:57.621
Move! Go, go, go!

01:52:57.789 --> 01:53:01.249
Get over there! Stay! Up!

01:53:31.489 --> 01:53:33.949
Get us level! Level!

01:53:34.158 --> 01:53:35.784
It's all smashed!

01:53:35.993 --> 01:53:37.035
Christmas?

01:53:38.496 --> 01:53:42.249
- So we're going up, then?
- Slight miscalculation.

01:53:54.345 --> 01:53:55.429
Hold on!

01:53:57.557 --> 01:53:59.516
Hold on, hold on.

01:54:14.824 --> 01:54:16.199
Brace yourself.

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:48.648
- It's flooding!
- Get up to the hatch.

01:54:56.616 --> 01:55:00.660
Damn! Come on! Go, go!

01:55:01.412 --> 01:55:04.581
Move! Go on! Get out, now!

01:55:25.478 --> 01:55:27.938
He's opened up the reactor!

01:55:28.022 --> 01:55:29.564
And locked himself in!

01:55:29.649 --> 01:55:31.525
I have to get up there to him.

01:55:32.276 --> 01:55:33.652
We've got one chance.

01:55:33.736 --> 01:55:38.323
I'll get out of the submarine and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch.

01:55:41.827 --> 01:55:45.789
When the light goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.

01:55:46.457 --> 01:55:48.041
James, it's too risky.

01:55:48.125 --> 01:55:50.961
If I don't make it,
use this chamber to get out.

01:55:51.045 --> 01:55:52.254
Close the hatch.

01:55:52.338 --> 01:55:54.589
Be sure to exhale all the way up. Close it.

01:58:23.906 --> 01:58:24.906
James!

01:58:27.284 --> 01:58:28.284
Help!

01:58:39.463 --> 01:58:40.714
Come on, come on!

01:58:43.926 --> 01:58:46.010
We're safe from the radiation

01:58:46.095 --> 01:58:48.930
as long as the reactor coolant
doesn't burst.

01:58:49.014 --> 01:58:51.725
If he had gotten the plutonium rod
in the reactor,

01:58:51.934 --> 01:58:54.310
we could've written off the whole city.

01:58:54.562 --> 01:58:55.562
James!

01:58:58.524 --> 01:59:00.483
Welcome to my nuclear family.

01:59:27.052 --> 01:59:29.471
Are you really gonna
commit suicide for her?

01:59:29.555 --> 01:59:32.015
You forget, I'm already dead.

01:59:32.391 --> 01:59:35.727
Haven't you heard? So is she.

01:59:39.774 --> 01:59:42.150
You're lying.

01:59:45.529 --> 01:59:46.696
Liar!

02:01:08.737 --> 02:01:10.113
She's waiting for you.

02:01:28.382 --> 02:01:33.386
The hydrogen gas level's too high.
One spark and the reactor will blow.

02:01:33.596 --> 02:01:35.179
I have to stop it.

02:01:38.851 --> 02:01:42.020
Go to the top of the submarine.
I'll meet you in the torpedo bay. Go!

02:01:47.902 --> 02:01:49.444
The reactor is flooded.

02:01:51.238 --> 02:01:53.907
So it's safe even if this place blows.

02:02:26.315 --> 02:02:27.315
Hey!

02:02:30.402 --> 02:02:31.402
Hey!

02:02:31.946 --> 02:02:34.072
- Hi!
- Hello!

02:02:38.118 --> 02:02:42.872
No, it's simply not the case.
No. Before that.

02:02:48.253 --> 02:02:50.964
- Any word?
- No. Still no contact.

02:02:56.053 --> 02:02:58.429
Always wanted to have Christmas
in Turkey.

02:03:00.975 --> 02:03:06.020
- Was that a Christmas joke?
- From me? No. Never.

02:03:07.064 --> 02:03:09.482
So isn't it time
you unwrapped your present?

02:03:09.566 --> 02:03:11.025
Oh, I think so.

02:03:15.864 --> 02:03:17.407
Look. What's that?

02:03:18.325 --> 02:03:19.951
- The card.
- So he must be nearby.

02:03:20.244 --> 02:03:21.327
Where?

02:03:24.415 --> 02:03:26.165
- Where?
- It picks up body heat,

02:03:26.250 --> 02:03:28.042
so humans come out orange.

02:03:30.337 --> 02:03:31.379
There.

02:03:34.508 --> 02:03:36.384
I thought you said he was with Dr. Jones?

02:03:42.099 --> 02:03:43.099
It's getting redder.

02:03:50.691 --> 02:03:51.899
007!

02:03:57.281 --> 02:04:00.408
Must be a premature form
of the millennium bug.

02:04:03.287 --> 02:04:04.829
I was wrong about you.

02:04:06.123 --> 02:04:07.874
Yeah? How so?

02:04:09.835 --> 02:04:12.835
I thought Christmas only comes
once a year.
