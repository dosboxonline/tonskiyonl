02:20.050 --> 02:22.850
- Easy!
- Excuse me!

02:40.280 --> 02:41.520
Good morning. Jackson Steinem.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.950
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Great, Carolyn.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.580
Doing any better would be a sin.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.960
Morning.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.850
Morning, Dan. What's looking good today?

03:01.970 --> 03:05.600
If I knew, I wouldn't be in this business.
Get out while you're young.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.940
I came here one day, I sat down,
and look at me now.

03:09.060 --> 03:11.150
Look at you now.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.190
Morning, Brian.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.070
- Chuckie! How's the woman slayer?
- Looking for an 18-year-old wife.

03:19.150 --> 03:22.200
- How you doing, pal?
- Well, if I had your looks, better.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.830
Takes years of genetics,
a Yale education and the right tailor.

03:25.950 --> 03:28.460
Not that you learned anything, Chunk.

03:30.540 --> 03:34.500
Marv, I got a feeling that we
are gonna make a killing today.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.250
Yeah? Where's your machine gun?

03:36.380 --> 03:38.340
You can't make a buck in this market.

03:38.470 --> 03:42.430
The country's going to hell faster
than when Roosevelt was in charge!

03:42.510 --> 03:45.760
Too much cheap money
sloshing around the world.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.730
Worst mistake we ever made was
letting Nixon get off the gold standard.

03:49.810 --> 03:52.230
Putney Drug-you boys
might wanna look at it.

03:52.230 --> 03:56.690
- No. They'll take five years to come around.
- But they got a good new drug.

03:56.820 --> 04:00.780
Stick to the fundamentals.
That's how IBM and Hilton were built.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.910
Good things sometimes take time.

04:03.990 --> 04:08.500
Look sharp, especially you rookies.
Nikkei Index closed up 90 points last night.

04:08.580 --> 04:11.210
We expect heavy Japanese buying
on the opening.

04:11.290 --> 04:16.420
The firm has 200,000 steel for sale.
A million Big Blue. 350,000 pork and beans.

04:16.420 --> 04:21.510
Get on the horn with your institutions.
These utilities are our top priority today.

04:21.630 --> 04:25.890
- OK. Let's go to work.
- And they're off and running!

04:41.530 --> 04:47.490
We cleared up to 60,000 XGC at 4 81/2.
Yes, that's right. Right.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.420
- The market just doubled.
- Brenner!

04:55.710 --> 04:58.550
Research has put thrifts
on the recommended.

04:58.550 --> 05:01.260
What? Dump it for chrissake!

05:01.340 --> 05:06.050
30,000. Three-eight top.
I go along at 23. You got it.

05:06.050 --> 05:09.180
Now you own it!
Conwest Air? Let me check it.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.520
Circle 29,000 Niagaras for Templeton.

05:17.520 --> 05:23.570
Mr Harrison, are you aware that we are
in the biggest bull market of our generation?

05:23.650 --> 05:27.530
No, sir, it's not what you think.
If you take five minutes of your time...

05:28.030 --> 05:30.540
Dreyfus is looking for 50,000 Conair!

05:30.660 --> 05:33.160
September 50s? How about Decembers?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.870
Mr Zaros? Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.420
Yes, sir, I am aware of that.

05:37.540 --> 05:41.800
But if I could have five minutes
to explain the opportunities emerging...

05:41.920 --> 05:43.880
...in the international debt market.

05:44.010 --> 05:44.840
No, no...

05:44.920 --> 05:46.800
Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

05:46.930 --> 05:52.770
Yes, I am aware of this. But if I could just
explain the opportunities emerging...

05:52.850 --> 05:55.770
...in the international debt market...

05:55.890 --> 05:57.980
I'm sure that...

06:05.150 --> 06:09.870
Yesterday concerns my future.
I need the info now, before the close.

06:09.950 --> 06:12.990
No, in ten minutes it's history.
At four I'm a dinosaur!

06:13.080 --> 06:18.500
Howard, I thought you were a gentleman.
Sure it's gone down. You got the tip. I didn't.

06:18.630 --> 06:21.540
- Why would I tell you to sell it?
- Give it back!

06:21.630 --> 06:24.340
To who? I can't give it back-you own it!

06:24.460 --> 06:26.130
No, he's not here.

06:26.130 --> 06:29.470
- That's what you told us to say.
- Gimme that phone.

06:29.550 --> 06:31.550
- Hello?
- Hello.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.180
- Who am I talking to?
- The sales manager. What's the problem?

06:35.310 --> 06:39.900
What? Will you gimme a break? How was
I supposed to know you were in surgery?

06:39.980 --> 06:42.400
What am I - Marvin the Mindreader?!

06:42.480 --> 06:47.400
Uh, no, sir. I'll discuss that with the
account executive, and I'll get back to you.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.780
No, no, sir. You're welcome.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.790
I'm closing the account.
If he doesn't pay tomorrow, you pay.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.290
Mr Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying.

06:59.370 --> 07:01.790
We give you a rich man's account...

07:01.790 --> 07:05.420
...and you tell me he's gonna DK you
for a lousy quarter point?

07:05.550 --> 07:09.930
You're being unfair, sir.
You know he's got a history for bullshit.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.510
Somebody's got to pay.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.930
Ain't gonna be me.

07:17.310 --> 07:20.440
Buddy, Buddy.
A little trouble, huh, today, Buddy?

07:20.560 --> 07:25.230
Howard the jerk reneged on me. I gotta
cover his losses to the tune of seven grand.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.820
Yeah! I'm holding!

07:26.900 --> 07:30.360
I'm tapped out. American Express
got a hit man looking for me.

07:30.780 --> 07:34.410
It coulda been worse, right?
Coulda been my money.

07:36.080 --> 07:40.580
Here, here, rookie, let me help you out.
I got... a C-note.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.880
- Thanks, Marv. I'll make it up to you.
- Yes, I am still here!

07:46.710 --> 07:50.880
You know what my dream is?
To one day be on the other end of that phone.

07:51.010 --> 07:54.220
Oh, you got it, baby.
Where the real cheesecake is.

07:55.390 --> 07:57.890
Hey, Bud, you forgetting something?

07:57.970 --> 08:00.060
The Gekko phone call?

08:00.600 --> 08:05.400
When are you gonna realise it's the big game
hunters who bag elephants, not guys like us.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.690
- Gordon Gekko, please.
- Gekko's beautiful.

08:07.780 --> 08:11.650
30 seconds after the Challenger blew up,
he's selling NASA stock short.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.830
Yeah, but... 47 million he made
on the Melcore deal.

08:15.910 --> 08:18.830
23 on the Imperial deal before he was 40.

08:18.950 --> 08:24.040
The guy makes 20 times what Dave Winfield
makes in a year, and he talks to everybody.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.540
And he had an ethical bypass at birth.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.840
- Hello, Natalie. Guess who?
- Mr Fox.

08:28.960 --> 08:35.429
Right. Every day I say to myself that today
could be the day. So will you marry me?

08:35.510 --> 08:39.179
- I'll think about it.
- Then can you get me through to Mr Gekko?

08:39.270 --> 08:43.230
- He's very busy.
- Of course he is. Five minutes is all I ask.

08:43.350 --> 08:48.980
Mr Fox, I'm sure you're a good broker,
but our traders deal with the brokers.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.360
Mr Gekko deals with investment bankers.

08:51.490 --> 08:55.740
- Tell him I called. There are big changes...
- Yes, I'll give him your message.

08:55.870 --> 09:01.500
Leo, I understand, but you have to realise
there'll be major subordinated debt involved.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.720
- Buddy, how ya doing?
- Great, Charlie. Any better would be a sin.

09:19.850 --> 09:24.850
Jesus Christ! Listen, I hear all you guys
on Wall Street are millionaires.

09:24.850 --> 09:28.900
- When you gonna make us all rich?
- You need an account to win the lottery.

09:29.020 --> 09:33.400
- Give me 50 grand. I'll get you a condo.
- Sure! We'll own the airline by then!

09:33.490 --> 09:37.990
Why don't he make himself rich,
so he can pay off his school loans?

09:38.200 --> 09:42.250
Nice to see you're in such a good mood, Dad.
Did Mom give you fish for dinner?

09:42.370 --> 09:45.790
You smoke too much. How often you
gotta go to the hospital to realise?

09:45.920 --> 09:50.500
Leave me alone. It's the only thing that
makes me feel good. There, Frank. All set.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.260
Spaghetti!
Your mother still makes lousy spaghetti.

09:54.340 --> 09:58.850
- It's pasta now. Spaghetti's out of date.
- So am I. You want a beer?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.970
Billie! Bring a Molson Lite for the kid!

10:03.220 --> 10:05.600
- Looking good, huh?
- He looks terrific.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.860
Carl, we'll be at the bar.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.480
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right, Charlie.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.240
So...

10:16.650 --> 10:20.950
You look like you've grown another inch,
but you don't look so hot, Buddy.

10:21.030 --> 10:25.120
- You're gonna get bags under your eyes.
- Yeah, I had a tough day.

10:25.120 --> 10:29.170
- Some jerk DK'd me. I gotta cover his loss.
- Speak English.

10:29.290 --> 10:32.710
DK: Didn't Know who I was
when the options he bought took a bath.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.380
- Bastard reneged on me!
- I told you not to get into that racket.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.760
You coulda been a doctor or a lawyer.

10:38.890 --> 10:44.720
If you'd stayed at Bluestar, you coulda been a
supervisor now, instead of being a salesman.

10:44.810 --> 10:49.190
Dad, how many times I gotta tell you I am not
a salesman? I'm an account executive.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.820
Soon I'm moving into investment banking.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.150
You ask strangers for money -
you're a salesman.

10:55.150 --> 10:58.490
Dad, it takes time.
You gotta build a client list.

10:58.570 --> 11:02.450
I can make more money in one year
as a broker than in five at this airline.

11:02.660 --> 11:04.620
Thank you, Billie.

11:04.740 --> 11:09.420
I don't get it, kid. You borrow money to go
to NYU. First year out, you make 35 grand.

11:09.540 --> 11:13.380
You made 50 grand last year, and can't
pay off your loans. Where does it go?!

11:13.500 --> 11:16.920
Dad, 50K does not get you
to first base in the Big Apple.

11:17.050 --> 11:19.130
I got 40% in taxes, 15 grand for rent.

11:19.220 --> 11:24.010
I got school loans, car loans, food -
that's three bills a month. I need suits...

11:24.140 --> 11:28.600
Come back home and live rent-free
instead of that roach-infected place.

11:28.730 --> 11:32.360
$50,000! Jesus Christ!
The whole world's off its rocker!

11:32.480 --> 11:36.230
I made $47,000 last year. That's before taxes.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.780
That's Queens, Dad! A 5% mortgage
and you rent the top room.

11:39.860 --> 11:45.290
I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player.
There is no nobility in poverty any more, Dad.

11:45.410 --> 11:48.120
One day you'll be proud of me. You'll see.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.920
It's yourself you gotta
be proud of, Huckleberry.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.090
How much you need?

11:55.710 --> 11:59.380
Can you spare 300?
I'll pay you back next month, I promise.

11:59.470 --> 12:03.140
- I don't know if I got that much on me.
- Not in here. Please.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.430
It adds up. 300 here, 200 there.
Your brother...

12:08.980 --> 12:13.650
I always say money's something you need
in case you don't die tomorrow. Right, Carl?

12:13.770 --> 12:15.650
How you doing?

12:15.730 --> 12:19.280
- How's work treating you?
- Damn mandatory drug test.

12:19.400 --> 12:24.200
They're driving us crazy. I got flagged for my
blood pressure pills. Can you believe that?

12:24.280 --> 12:29.000
The good news is we had a meeting with
the controller about some union business.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.420
Remember the accident last year
and the investigation?

12:32.540 --> 12:38.170
The FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing
error in the door-latch mechanism. I knew it.

12:38.250 --> 12:43.260
I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance.
It's the greedy manufacturers in Cincinnati.

12:43.390 --> 12:46.810
- That's great.
- This gets us out from under suspension.

12:46.930 --> 12:52.440
We can go for those new routes to Pittsburgh
and Boston. We'll compete with the big guys.

12:52.640 --> 12:57.570
To Bluestar. As your broker, all I can
advise is you hold on to that stock.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.070
What stock? Are you kiddin'?

13:00.990 --> 13:03.700
- Are you sure about this thing?
- What?

13:04.530 --> 13:07.370
- The FAA announcement.
- Sure I'm sure.

13:09.120 --> 13:14.120
Look at me. You got that
mischievous look in your eye, Buddy.

13:14.250 --> 13:17.380
You used to smile like that
when you were a kid sleeping.

13:17.790 --> 13:20.300
It's true. Just like that.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.050
Morning, Gordon.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.770
Delivery for Mr Gekko. It's a personal item.
He needs you to sign for it.

14:15.770 --> 14:17.440
Send him in.

14:30.660 --> 14:36.000
Hello, Natalie. Recognise the voice? Here's
a hint-you're thinking about marrying me.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.920
- Why are you here?
- You're lovelier than I pictured.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.510
- Got a birthday present for Mr Gekko.
- You can't come barging in here.

14:43.510 --> 14:48.390
- What makes you think it's his birthday?
- Well, it's in the bible, see?

14:48.510 --> 14:50.600
You better go buy him a gift.

14:50.680 --> 14:56.310
Please, Natalie, let me give this to him.
Cuban cigars. His favourite and tough to get.

14:58.310 --> 15:00.400
Please, Natalie?

15:02.570 --> 15:05.190
Stay here. I'll see what I can do.

15:24.050 --> 15:25.710
Wait outside.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.430
Yeah, I'll see you shortly, I hope.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.230
Five minutes.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.200
Well, life all comes down to a few moments.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.910
This is one of 'em.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.370
What the hell's going on?

16:01.500 --> 16:06.090
I'm looking at 200,000 shares move, pal.
I wanna know if we're part of it.

16:06.170 --> 16:10.260
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come
and eat your lunch for you. Back in two.

16:10.340 --> 16:14.720
Sorry, Jeff. Look, I loved it at 40.
It's an insult at 50.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.480
Their analysts don't know
preferred stock from livestock.

16:18.600 --> 16:23.610
Wait till it heads south, then we raise the
sperm count on the deal. Get back at ya.

16:25.150 --> 16:30.360
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days in a row.
Wants to be a player.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.490
Oughta be in the dictionary
under "persistence".

16:33.620 --> 16:38.080
Listen, Jerry, I'm looking for negative control.
No more than 30, 35%.

16:38.200 --> 16:43.830
Just enough to block anybody else's merger
plans, and find out if the books are cooked.

16:43.830 --> 16:47.590
If it looks as good as on paper,
we're in the kill zone, pal.

16:47.590 --> 16:51.630
Lunch? You kiddin'? Lunch is for wimps.
OK, Billy. I'll talk at ya.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.100
How do you do, Mr Gekko? I'm Bud Fox.

16:58.220 --> 17:01.430
So you say. Nice to meet you.
Hope you're intelligent.

17:01.560 --> 17:06.150
- Where'd you get these?
- I got a connection at the airport.

17:06.230 --> 17:09.900
So what's on your mind, kemo sabe?
Why am I listening to you?

17:09.900 --> 17:13.740
I gotta monitor my blood pressure,
so don't upset me.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.319
No. No, sir.

17:15.410 --> 17:20.619
In 45 seconds, the microprocessor computes
your systolic and diastolic pressure.

17:20.750 --> 17:25.210
Got an LCD read-out, cost-effective...
Less than one visit to a doctor.

17:27.630 --> 17:33.470
I just wanna let you know I've read all about
you at NYU Business. I think you're a genius.

17:34.180 --> 17:38.470
I've always dreamed of one thing and
that's to do business with a man like you.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.850
- What firm you with?
- Jackson Steinem.

17:40.970 --> 17:43.690
They're going places.
Good junk-bond department.

17:43.770 --> 17:46.690
You the financing on
that Jansen investment?

17:46.810 --> 17:50.150
Yeah. I'm working on
some other interesting stuff.

17:50.150 --> 17:52.740
Cosmetic company, by any chance?

17:52.860 --> 17:55.570
Are you twelfth man on the deal team?
Last to know?

17:56.200 --> 18:00.040
- I can't tell you that, Mr Gekko.
- So what you got for me, sport?

18:00.160 --> 18:02.870
Chart breakout on
Whitewood-Young Industries.

18:02.870 --> 18:07.670
Explosive earnings. A 30% discount from
book. Great cash flow. Couple of 5% holders.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.540
- It's a dog.
- Strong management.

18:09.630 --> 18:14.340
It's a dog, pal. What else you got
besides connections at the airport?

18:14.420 --> 18:17.550
Mr Stevenson in San Francisco.

18:21.010 --> 18:23.520
- He respond?
- Lecturing on economics.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.600
- What?!
- No, he's in Chicago.

18:25.690 --> 18:30.610
Why the hell is Cromwell giving a lecture
tour when he's losing 60 million a quarter?!

18:30.610 --> 18:33.320
Guess he's giving lectures
in how to lose money.

18:33.320 --> 18:38.530
If this guy owned a funeral parlour,
no one would die! This turkey is braindead!

18:39.370 --> 18:43.330
OK. All right, Christmas is over,
and business is business.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.330
You keep on buying. Dilute the son of a bitch!

18:46.460 --> 18:50.210
Ollie, I want every orifice
in his fuckin' body flowin' red!

18:50.290 --> 18:52.500
He's flowin', Gordo. Piece of cake.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.010
This guy's the best trader on the street.

18:55.090 --> 19:00.010
Susan, get me the LBO analysis
on Teldar Paper. Bring it in here, please.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.220
- Mr Gekko, your wife.
- What else you got?

19:03.850 --> 19:09.480
Terafly. Analysts don't like it. I do.
The break-up value is twice the market price.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.610
This deal finances itself.
You sell off two divisions...

19:12.730 --> 19:16.150
Not bad for a quant,
but that's a dog with different fleas.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.610
Come on, pal.
Tell me something I don't know.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.990
It's my birthday.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.200
Surprise me.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.830
- Bluestar.
- What?

19:30.670 --> 19:34.300
- Bluestar Airlines.
- Rings a bell somewhere. So what?

19:35.130 --> 19:39.510
It's a comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots.

19:39.630 --> 19:44.220
Flies to Florida, Canada,
uh, Northeast, the Caribbean.

19:44.220 --> 19:48.060
- Great slots in major cities.
- I don't like airlines. Lousy unions.

19:48.180 --> 19:51.310
Well, there was a crash last year.

19:51.310 --> 19:54.230
They just got a favourable
ruling on a lawsuit.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.150
Even the plaintiffs don't know about it.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.160
Well, how do you know about it?

20:00.780 --> 20:02.660
I just know.

20:02.780 --> 20:06.200
The decision should clear the way
for new planes and routes.

20:06.330 --> 20:10.290
There's only a small float. You should grab it.
Good for a five-point pop.

20:10.370 --> 20:13.000
250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Jansen.

20:13.080 --> 20:16.630
I can pull twice that at 18 1/2
from the California pensions.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.970
We got close to half a million
shares in the bag.

20:20.090 --> 20:23.640
The Terminator!
Blow 'em away, Ollie!

20:24.260 --> 20:27.890
We got the Beezer Brothers.
I'm working on the Silverberg boys.

20:28.020 --> 20:32.600
Rip their fuckin' throats out!
Stuff 'em in your garbage compactor!

20:32.690 --> 20:34.770
Interesting. Got a card?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.480
Home number's on the back.

20:37.610 --> 20:41.360
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred
deals a day. I choose one.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.990
- I hope to hear from you, sir.
- Thanks for the cigars.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.240
Let's go, guys. Looks like
we're going over 5% in Teldar.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.250
Start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13D.

20:51.370 --> 20:54.290
We buy everything in sight,
but we don't pay over 22.

20:54.710 --> 20:58.340
They'll fight. They got Myers
and Thromberg doing their legal.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.430
- Thanks, Natalie.
- Have a nice day, Mr Fox.

21:02.510 --> 21:07.510
Mr Gekko, your conference call is ready. Mr
Sugarman in Delaware, Mr Bernard in LA...

21:07.640 --> 21:10.770
...Mr Jackson and Ms Rosco
in London. They're all on.

21:11.180 --> 21:14.190
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm in a bind down here.

21:14.600 --> 21:19.730
We got all these damn new computers and
young men that are edging me out here.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.780
Hey, Bud! Did he see you?

21:24.320 --> 21:26.410
Yeah, he saw right through me.

21:26.490 --> 21:30.160
Cheer up. You shook Gekko's hand
and you still got all your fingers.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.580
Besides, he's not the only
elephant in the jungle.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.340
Holy cow! Did you get something
from him? Teldar Paper, huh?

21:37.460 --> 21:40.170
Nah. It's a dog with fleas.

21:41.420 --> 21:46.010
Fox, where have you been
for the last three hours, hm?

21:46.510 --> 21:50.180
If I were you, and I thank
my personal God I am not...

21:50.180 --> 21:52.890
...I wouldn't be sitting around chinwagging.

21:52.890 --> 21:57.480
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip-code pile to cold-call.

22:01.030 --> 22:06.110
Buddy, I got tickets for the Knick game
tonight. Cruise some chicks afterwards.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.280
Whaddaya say?

22:07.370 --> 22:10.410
- No, I gotta read my charts.
- Forget charts, will ya?

22:10.490 --> 22:13.330
We're not fund managers.
Churn 'em and burn 'em!

22:13.410 --> 22:15.830
I am offering you the Knicks and chicks.

22:15.920 --> 22:20.420
God help you before you turn
into poor Steeples over there.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.170
Preferably Lou Mannheim.

22:24.260 --> 22:30.220
Yeah, nice guy, but he's a loser. He lost all
his equity when the firm went belly-up in '71.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.350
You wanna be in your sixties still pitching?

22:33.350 --> 22:37.940
Hey, Buddy, whatever happened to
that cute analyst at Thudder and Wicks?

22:37.940 --> 22:41.900
Cindy. Having sex with her
was like reading the Wall Street Journal.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.280
- She had a heartbeat.
- You wanna bet?

22:44.610 --> 22:47.320
I gotta get to work. Zs today.

22:48.570 --> 22:50.740
Call for you, Buddy! Pick up two!

22:53.580 --> 22:56.370
- Bud Fox.
- All right, Bud Fox.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.040
I want you to buy 20,000 shares of Bluestar...

23:00.750 --> 23:05.050
...at fifteen and an eighth,
three-eighths tops.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.390
And don't screw it up, sport.

23:08.590 --> 23:13.890
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir! Thank you. You won't regret this.

23:14.020 --> 23:17.140
Whoo! Marv, I just bagged the elephant!

23:19.520 --> 23:20.770
Gekko?

23:54.890 --> 23:58.020
- Hiya, sport.
- Nice to see you again, Mr Gekko.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.560
Try the steak tartare. It's off the menu.
Louis'll make it for you.

24:01.650 --> 24:06.780
- Of course, sir. Anything to drink?
- Just an Evian, please.

24:06.780 --> 24:11.360
Hey, see this? Can you believe it?
It's got a two-inch screen.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.870
I can hardly see it.

24:13.870 --> 24:17.910
It's for my kid - Rudy.
Three years old, he's an electronics freak.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.960
We're going into a new age, pal.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.750
So how's business today?

24:23.880 --> 24:28.550
Great. Bluestar was at 17 1/4
when I left the office. Up from 15.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.760
Might spin up to 18 by the bell.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.390
Teldar's shooting up.
Did you buy any for yourself?

24:34.510 --> 24:39.180
I bet you were on the phone
two minutes after you got out of my office.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.650
No, sir, that wouldn't have been legal.

24:42.730 --> 24:47.320
Sure. Relax, pal.
No one's gonna blow the whistle on you.

24:48.690 --> 24:52.530
Is that legal? Why don't you
put that in my account?

24:52.660 --> 24:56.200
- Hey, Gordon!
- Georgie! The cellular king! How you been?

24:56.280 --> 24:59.540
- Monique, nice to see you, my dear.
- Hello, Gordon.

24:59.620 --> 25:03.500
- You look wonderful.
- You're looking very well yourself.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.670
And Mr Davis...

25:06.630 --> 25:09.960
Can I get the check here, please?
For chrissakes!

25:09.960 --> 25:15.390
Cover that Bluestar buy. Put 200 thou on one
of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned.

25:15.390 --> 25:20.600
Pick the dog with the least fleas.
Use a stop-loss, so your downside's 100 thou.

25:21.310 --> 25:25.400
And buy a decent suit.
You can't come in here looking like this.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.690
Go to Morty Sills. Tell him I sent you.

25:27.690 --> 25:32.570
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr Gekko. Thank you
for the chance. You will not regret this.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.360
You're with a winner.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.320
Right... right...

25:37.280 --> 25:42.080
Put the rest of the money in a tax-free fund.
I wanna see how you do before I invest it.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.790
And save the cheap salesman talk.
It's obvious.

25:44.870 --> 25:47.500
- Excuse me, sir?
- You heard me.

25:48.130 --> 25:52.590
I don't like losses, sport.
Nothing ruins my day more than losses.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.050
Now you do good... you get perks.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.760
Lots and lots of perks.

25:59.260 --> 26:02.810
- Louis, take care of my friend.
- Thank you, sir.

26:02.930 --> 26:05.020
Have a good lunch, Buddy.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.770
Hi, Richard.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.260
Hi, Bud.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.600
Hi.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.930
I'm Lisa. A friend of Gordon's.

26:46.310 --> 26:50.070
Lisa? Gordon? Oh, oh, Mr Gekko. Sure.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.900
Uh, would you like to come in?

26:54.320 --> 26:56.110
Didn't he tell you?

26:56.200 --> 26:59.030
Oh, that's so like Gordon.

26:59.530 --> 27:03.410
Why don't you get dressed? We're going out.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.120
We are?

27:24.140 --> 27:26.560
So... where are we going?

27:26.640 --> 27:28.730
Wherever you like.

27:29.350 --> 27:33.020
Lutéce. 21. The River Café.

27:33.940 --> 27:36.240
Or maybe we could just...

27:37.200 --> 27:39.700
...drive around for a while.

27:41.450 --> 27:43.950
Work up an appetite.

27:47.210 --> 27:49.290
Want some?

27:54.170 --> 27:57.300
Gordon tells me that
you're a very talented broker.

27:59.180 --> 28:01.260
What do you like?

28:01.890 --> 28:04.310
Like? Well...

28:04.510 --> 28:08.270
I've got this guy who tells me
to buy Hewlett-Packard...

28:08.350 --> 28:10.850
...but I've been burned on tips.

28:11.480 --> 28:15.980
Uh... Hewlett.
Now, let's see. It closed at 41 1/4.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.110
Up an eighth. Very attractive.

28:20.570 --> 28:23.070
About, uh... average yield.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.660
Very attractive.

28:25.790 --> 28:28.080
Rising profits.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.170
Strong balance sheet.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.130
You're hot on this stock.

28:32.250 --> 28:34.960
Uh... It's ready to take off.

28:35.590 --> 28:38.300
I'd jump all over it if I were you.

28:40.590 --> 28:43.720
- Good morning, Carolyn.
- Morning. You look happy.

28:43.800 --> 28:47.890
- Any better and I'd be guilty.
- You were never innocent, sugar pie.

28:47.890 --> 28:50.600
How do you know? You wish!

30:06.930 --> 30:11.730
Goddamn! We sure went down
the toilet on that ugly bitch!

30:11.930 --> 30:17.770
Oh, Buddy! Mr Gekko's office is looking
for you. Be at the Wyatt Club courts at six.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.830
Come on, sport. You gotta try harder.

30:32.790 --> 30:35.370
I need some exercise, for chrissakes.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.760
- I don't think I can go on, Mr Gekko.
- Push yourself. Finish out the game.

30:43.090 --> 30:45.380
It's a very nice club, Mr Gekko.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.260
Yeah.

30:47.390 --> 30:49.890
Not bad for a City College boy.

30:51.140 --> 30:56.140
Bought my way in. Now all these Ivy League
schmucks are sucking my kneecaps.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.400
I just got on the board of the Bronx Zoo.

31:00.730 --> 31:03.030
It cost me a mil.

31:03.940 --> 31:06.780
That's the thing you gotta
remember about WASPs.

31:06.990 --> 31:10.120
They love animals,
but they can't stand people.

31:12.410 --> 31:14.500
Uh, Mr Gekko...

31:15.120 --> 31:17.620
...we took a little loss today.

31:18.250 --> 31:22.300
We got stopped out on Terafly.
About a hundred grand.

31:27.220 --> 31:32.220
Well, I guess your dad's not a union
representative of that company, huh?

31:32.220 --> 31:34.810
How do you know about my father?

31:35.140 --> 31:39.310
The most valuable commodity
I know of is information.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.020
Wouldn't you agree?

31:42.440 --> 31:44.320
Yeah.

31:50.030 --> 31:53.580
The public's out there
throwing darts at a board, sport.

31:55.370 --> 32:00.040
I don't throw darts at a board.
I bet on sure things.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.000
Read Sun Tzu, The Art of War.

32:04.130 --> 32:08.300
"Every battle is won before it's ever fought."

32:09.010 --> 32:11.090
Think about it.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.720
You're not as smart as I thought you were.

32:14.010 --> 32:17.980
You ever wonder why fund managers
can't beat the S&P 500?

32:18.100 --> 32:21.440
Cos they're sheep.
And sheep get slaughtered.

32:23.310 --> 32:26.320
I've been in this business since '69.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.990
Most of these Harvard MBA types
don't add up to dogshit.

32:30.070 --> 32:34.660
You need guys that are poor,
smart and hungry. And no feelings.

32:34.870 --> 32:39.040
You win a few, you lose a few,
but you keep on fighting.

32:39.580 --> 32:44.380
And if you need a friend, get a dog.
It's trench warfare out there, pal.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.550
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey, Gordon.

32:46.670 --> 32:50.720
- How's Larchmont treating you?
- Fine. How's the Praxar deal going?

32:50.840 --> 32:53.550
- You should know, pal.
- Asshole!

32:55.220 --> 32:57.310
And inside here, too.

32:58.770 --> 33:03.350
I got 20 other brokers analysing charts, pal.
I don't need another one.

33:04.060 --> 33:06.570
See you around, Buddy.

33:06.690 --> 33:12.110
I am not just another broker, Mr Gekko.
If you give me another chance, I'll prove it.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.080
I'll go the extra yard for you.
Just one more chance, Mr Gekko. Please!

33:16.160 --> 33:22.330
Want another chance? Then stop sending me
information, and start getting me some.

33:23.380 --> 33:26.090
Get dressed. I'll show you my charts.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.800
- You know the name?
- Larry Wildman, one of the first raiders.

33:33.890 --> 33:39.020
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits, thinks
he was born with a better pot to piss in.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.940
Bribed an old secretary of mine
to open her mouth.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.480
Stole RDL Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.570
Wildman, the "White Knight".

33:47.650 --> 33:51.110
I remember that deal.
You were involved, Mr Gekko?

33:51.110 --> 33:53.200
Payback time, sport.

33:53.280 --> 33:58.830
See that building? I bought that building
ten years ago. My first real-estate deal.

33:58.830 --> 34:03.000
Sold it two years later.
Made an $800,000 profit.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.630
It was better than sex.

34:06.750 --> 34:12.050
At the time I thought that was all the money
in the world. Now it's a day's pay.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.340
Anyway, I had a mole in Wildman's operation.

34:16.340 --> 34:20.810
- He gave me half the picture, then got fired.
- I don't think I follow you.

34:20.929 --> 34:25.190
Wildman's in town.
He just became an American citizen.

34:25.310 --> 34:27.810
Something big is going down, OK?

34:27.900 --> 34:33.530
I wanna know where he goes, what he sees.
I want you, pal, to fill out the missing picture.

34:36.360 --> 34:40.120
Mr Gekko, it's not exactly what I do.
I could lose my licence.

34:40.199 --> 34:46.250
If the SEC found out, I could go to jail.
That's inside information, isn't it?

34:46.370 --> 34:50.750
Like when a father tells his son
about a court ruling on an airline?

34:50.750 --> 34:55.010
Or someone overhears I'm buying Teldar,
and decides he's gonna buy some?

34:55.130 --> 35:00.140
Or the chairman of the board of XYZ
decides it's time to blow out XYZ?

35:00.140 --> 35:02.220
Is that what you mean?

35:05.140 --> 35:09.940
Unless your father's on the board
of directors of another company...

35:10.020 --> 35:14.110
...you and I are gonna have a very
tough time doing business together.

35:14.190 --> 35:17.530
- What about hard work?
- What about it? You work hard?

35:17.660 --> 35:21.830
Bet you stayed up analysing that stock
you gave me. Where'd it get you?

35:21.910 --> 35:27.040
My father worked like an elephant till
he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.210
Wake up, will ya, pal?

35:29.330 --> 35:32.670
If you're not inside, you are outside, OK?

35:32.670 --> 35:36.300
I'm not talking about some
$400,000-a-year Wall Street stiff...

35:36.420 --> 35:41.010
...flying first class and being comfortable.
I'm talking about liquid.

35:41.100 --> 35:44.020
Rich enough to have your own jet.

35:44.140 --> 35:47.060
Rich enough not to waste time.

35:47.140 --> 35:50.060
Fifty, a hundred million dollars, Buddy.

35:51.020 --> 35:53.110
A player...

35:53.190 --> 35:55.280
...or nothing.

35:56.860 --> 36:00.280
Now you had what it took
to get into my office.

36:00.410 --> 36:04.370
The real question is whether
you got what it takes to stay.

36:08.210 --> 36:09.670
Look at that.

36:09.790 --> 36:14.460
You're gonna tell me the difference
between this guy and that guy is luck?

36:15.920 --> 36:18.550
Mohammed, pull over.

36:18.630 --> 36:22.100
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
drop you off here. I'm late.

36:22.100 --> 36:25.100
Buddy, it's been nice meeting you, OK?

36:47.750 --> 36:49.830
All right, Mr Gekko.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.170
You got me.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.360
Excuse me, please.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.110
Excuse me.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.540
I'm sorry, sir. Do you have a reservation?

38:15.630 --> 38:19.800
- Uh, table for one.
- Reservations only. We're booked for a week.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.590
All right. Don't touch.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.290
Everything ready, sir.

39:07.050 --> 39:10.890
Excuse me! Is Mr Wildman
on board that plane?

39:11.010 --> 39:14.980
Shit! My boss is gonna kill me!
I'm supposed to give him this.

39:15.060 --> 39:18.310
- You know where that plane is going?
- Erie, Pennsylvania.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.480
Thank you.

39:21.520 --> 39:27.160
After spending the morning at Kahn
Seidelman in the junk-bond department...

39:27.280 --> 39:32.490
...he had lunch at that restaurant, Le Circus,
with some well-dressed bean counters.

39:32.790 --> 39:37.170
He later stopped off at Morgan. I'd say
from all the smiling and palm-pressing...

39:37.290 --> 39:40.090
...Larry got himself some
nice fat financing, GG.

39:40.210 --> 39:44.670
Bright, but not bright enough, Sherlock.
Roll the dice and play Monopoly.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.220
What box is Sir Larry gonna
land on in Erie, Pennsylvania?

39:50.220 --> 39:53.640
Jesus Christ! He's buying Anacott Steel.

39:53.770 --> 40:00.440
OK. When the market opens tomorrow,
I want you to buy 1500 July 50 calls.

40:01.150 --> 40:02.820
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

40:02.940 --> 40:07.820
And start buying 1,000-share blocks
and take it up to $50.

40:08.150 --> 40:12.330
When it reaches 50,
give out a little taste to your friends.

40:12.330 --> 40:17.540
Then I want you to call
the Wall Street Chronicle, extension 1605.

40:18.370 --> 40:22.840
You tell the man
"Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel".

40:22.960 --> 40:25.460
- You got that?
- The Wall Street Chronicle.

40:25.550 --> 40:29.930
Congratulations, Buddy.
You scored. I'll talk at ya.

40:32.970 --> 40:36.180
Start buying Anacott Steel across the board.

40:36.310 --> 40:38.810
Use the offshore accounts.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.940
And keep it quiet.

40:49.320 --> 40:53.490
Frank, 10,000 ANC at 46. Let me know
how the options are opening, OK?

40:53.620 --> 40:55.290
Thank you.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.920
Jackson Steinem!

41:04.250 --> 41:07.590
- How is Anacott Steel?
- 5 3/4, 6. 2,000 up.

41:07.670 --> 41:10.380
- Six at 10,000.
- I'll sell you 2,000.

41:10.510 --> 41:13.430
That's not what I said. I said 20,000 shares.

41:22.190 --> 41:24.690
Anacott trades at six.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.530
- 8,000 at a quarter?
- I'll take 8,000.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.950
Make it six to a half, 2,000 up.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.330
I know what time it is,
and this is what I'm saying.

41:35.410 --> 41:41.580
We have important financial news, Mr Erlich,
that just happens to concern your future.

41:41.580 --> 41:47.420
- You could benefit... What's going on?
- Anacott Steel. Put your best customers in it.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.130
Lou, I got a sure thing.

41:53.550 --> 41:55.430
Anacott Steel.

41:55.550 --> 42:01.180
No such thing, except death and taxes. Not
a good company any more. No fundamentals.

42:02.100 --> 42:04.190
What's goin' on, Bud?

42:06.270 --> 42:08.360
You know something?

42:09.320 --> 42:12.450
Remember, there are no short cuts, son.

42:13.070 --> 42:16.410
Quick-buck artists come and go
with every bull market.

42:16.410 --> 42:19.410
The steady players make it
through the bear markets.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.500
You're a part of something here, Bud.

42:21.620 --> 42:26.420
The money you make for people creates
science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.

42:26.500 --> 42:31.090
You're right, but you gotta get to the
big time first, then you can do good things.

42:31.210 --> 42:36.300
- You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.
- Lou, trust me. It's a winner. Buy it.

42:38.100 --> 42:41.850
We'll kamikaze over to Nell's,
chase some cotton underwear.

42:41.850 --> 42:46.230
I know this 18-year-old bimbette
that's gorgeous. Hold on.

42:46.230 --> 42:51.860
- Play tennis Saturday?
- Can't. Fly-fishing in Canada. Real big client.

42:51.940 --> 42:54.780
- Take Anacott?
- Light snack, but good. Thanks, pal.

42:54.860 --> 42:57.700
You're sharking your way up.

42:58.530 --> 43:01.040
No, no, my dear, you've got to diversify.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.040
I got a sure thing. Anacott Steel.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.880
I've just heard the most lovely two words.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.250
Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.710
Anacott Steel.

43:26.980 --> 43:31.570
Looks like Anacott Steel's in play.
Check the ARBs.

43:33.570 --> 43:36.570
Looks like it's being accumulated.

43:36.700 --> 43:41.790
Lou? Anacott. I buy. Yeah.
Take it and bid it.

43:41.990 --> 43:44.620
Quarters won't matter.
Keep taking Anacott.

43:44.830 --> 43:47.540
This is special. Anacott. Paint the tape.

43:47.540 --> 43:49.830
- Bet the ranch.
- Buy 100,000 shares.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.840
- Wildman is sniffing around.
- It's on automatic pilot to the moon.

43:52.960 --> 43:56.090
- If it hits 75, we'll clean 24 mil.
- Relax, pal.

43:56.510 --> 44:00.260
Don't get emotional about stock.
It clouds the judgment.

44:00.350 --> 44:05.560
Which closed at 51 1/8, up 5 1/8 from
yesterday's close on heavy trading.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.870
Can I help you?

44:22.990 --> 44:26.120
Yes, I'm Bud Fox. I have some
papers for Mr Gekko to sign.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.620
- Come in.
- Thank you.

44:30.920 --> 44:34.460
- I'm sorry about this, Mr Gekko.
- It's all right. It's OK.

44:35.710 --> 44:38.010
You wanna wait here?

44:38.090 --> 44:39.340
Problems?

44:39.470 --> 44:42.050
No problem.
This is Bud Fox. My wife, Kate.

44:42.180 --> 44:45.390
- Hello. You came out from the city?
- Yes, ma'am.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.640
Ah, long drive. You want a drink?

44:48.730 --> 44:50.940
Yeah, you want a drink? Um... sure.

44:51.020 --> 44:53.860
- If you'd rather not.
- No, come on. Have a drink.

44:53.940 --> 44:57.900
Get to meet all the people.
It's a good idea.

44:58.030 --> 45:02.620
We got Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston. This is Bud Fox.

45:03.450 --> 45:05.740
His illustrious wife, Muffie.

45:05.830 --> 45:10.420
Candice Rogers, Dick Brady.
Darien Taylor. All old friends.

45:10.540 --> 45:11.790
Hi.

45:16.380 --> 45:22.300
Great idea, Gordon. I know good help is hard
to find, but can it create a dry vodka martini?

45:22.430 --> 45:25.010
It doesn't talk back or steal the silverware.

45:25.140 --> 45:28.680
And Dick here is gonna get me
an exemption, aren't you?

45:28.770 --> 45:34.520
I'm in St Kitts with this new
Kamali leopard-skin V-cut bikini...

45:34.610 --> 45:39.320
...which is gonna turn back the clock on my
marriage five years. Know what I mean?

45:39.610 --> 45:43.280
Call for you, sir. Sir Lawrence Wildman.
He says it's important.

45:43.370 --> 45:45.030
Thank you, Nyung.

45:45.160 --> 45:49.540
Would you fix Mr Livingston another
martini? Stick around. This could be fun.

45:49.540 --> 45:54.540
It's all because this Ukrainian bitch
botched the job on my wax on my bikini line.

45:54.630 --> 45:56.500
How ghastly! Sue her.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.050
- Larry, what a surprise!
- I want to see you, Gordon.

46:00.170 --> 46:02.550
Can it wait till tomorrow? I got people here.

46:02.680 --> 46:07.970
- No, this can't wait. It's important.
- OK. If you feel that way, come on over.

46:09.850 --> 46:13.100
Ah! There you are!
Can I steal him for a minute?

46:13.190 --> 46:15.810
- Of course.
- I want your opinion.

46:23.740 --> 46:25.820
So what do you see in this?

46:30.700 --> 46:33.420
Purity. Innocence.

46:34.790 --> 46:38.420
A few thousand dollars
down the tubes, if you ask me.

46:38.550 --> 46:40.420
Really?

46:40.420 --> 46:43.760
You can kiss your career
as an art appraiser goodbye.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.930
We paid over 400,000 for it at the
contemporary picture sale last June.

46:48.010 --> 46:51.270
Jesus, you could've had
a whole beach house for that!

46:51.350 --> 46:54.690
Sure you could. In Wildwood, New Jersey.

46:56.270 --> 46:59.820
If you sold this one, you could
have a nice penthouse on Fifth.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.990
You wouldn't have much
left over for decoration.

47:04.070 --> 47:06.280
It's nice, if you're on mushrooms.

47:06.360 --> 47:11.160
I thought Gordon was a tough businessman.
He sure has taken a bath on that.

47:11.370 --> 47:17.210
A bath? I'd say Gordon is one of
the most astute collectors around.

47:17.330 --> 47:20.960
He has a great eye, and he only buys the best.

47:21.090 --> 47:26.380
Like this rug, for instance.
A Bokhara. It's the finest of its kind.

47:26.510 --> 47:30.470
After he bought it, a dealer
representing the Saudi royal family...

47:30.560 --> 47:35.060
...offered him twice what he paid.
It absolutely makes the room.

47:35.560 --> 47:39.860
See how this bit of celadon in the border
is picked up by these cushions?

47:39.940 --> 47:44.030
Although it's a sacrilege
having that Etruscan vase on the table.

47:44.110 --> 47:46.610
Some dope might use it as an ashtray.

47:47.570 --> 47:50.700
- I guess you're a decorator?
- You got it.

47:50.780 --> 47:53.500
A great spender of other people's money.

47:53.620 --> 47:57.170
If you're that good, I'm sure you
can do wonders with my place.

47:57.170 --> 48:00.170
- Where would that be?
- Upper West Side.

48:00.290 --> 48:05.300
Really? Home of the exposed
brick wall and the houseplant?

48:05.380 --> 48:11.010
It's just a rental. I'll be moving to the East
Side soon. Some deals brewing with Gordon.

48:11.140 --> 48:14.140
But that's just conversation.
What about real things?

48:14.270 --> 48:19.690
Like dinner? The two of us... next Friday?
Café Santo Domingo.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.020
What if I have a previous engagement?

48:23.110 --> 48:25.190
You break it.

48:25.320 --> 48:29.490
There you go again, Darien.
Talking with strange men.

48:29.570 --> 48:34.080
Hello. Sam, do you know Bud Fox?
Sam is in banking.

48:34.160 --> 48:37.710
- Works for Gordon.
- Nice meeting you.

48:37.830 --> 48:41.380
- Are you staying for dinner?
- No, I have work to do.

48:41.380 --> 48:43.460
- Ah. The bell.

48:46.380 --> 48:48.050
Excuse me.

48:49.180 --> 48:52.300
Call me next week. I'll give you an estimate.

48:56.180 --> 48:59.810
- Larry, how have you been?
- Fine. Travelling, actually.

48:59.940 --> 49:02.230
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

49:02.310 --> 49:05.780
Larry! Excuse me. Sir Larry.

49:06.820 --> 49:10.160
How are ya? Goddamn, you look great!

49:10.240 --> 49:13.490
- Gordon.
- So you wanna talk.

49:13.580 --> 49:17.540
- I'll be heading back now, Mr Gekko.
- Stick around.

49:17.660 --> 49:20.580
This is one of my gang. Bud Fox.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.540
Shall we go upstairs?

49:24.540 --> 49:26.000
Yeah.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.230
The rarest pistol in the world, Larry.

49:39.350 --> 49:41.640
A.45 Luger.

49:41.730 --> 49:44.770
Only six of 'em were ever manufactured.

49:46.020 --> 49:48.110
Congratulations.

49:49.150 --> 49:52.070
Rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.

49:52.160 --> 49:57.790
My interest is the same as yours. Money.
Thought it'd be a good investment for my kid.

49:57.910 --> 50:02.790
No, this time I'm in for the long term. It's
not a liquidation. I'm gonna turn it around.

50:02.920 --> 50:06.040
You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate.

50:06.670 --> 50:11.130
With the dollars you're costing me to
buy back stock, I could modernise the plant.

50:11.260 --> 50:14.180
I'm not the only one who pays here, Gordon.

50:14.260 --> 50:18.560
We're talking about lives and jobs.
Four generations of steelworkers...

50:18.640 --> 50:25.020
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you got
CNX Electronics, you laid off 6,000 workers.

50:25.020 --> 50:28.570
Jemson Fruit, 4,000.
That airline you bought, um...

50:28.650 --> 50:32.740
I could break you, mate.
In two pieces over my knees.

50:33.150 --> 50:35.240
You know it. I know it.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.160
I could buy you six times over.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.870
I could dump the stock just to burn your arse!

50:42.000 --> 50:46.080
But I happen to want the company,
and I want your block of shares.

50:46.920 --> 50:50.460
I'm announcing
a tender offer at 65 tomorrow.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.380
I'm expecting your commitment.

50:54.930 --> 50:59.850
Showdowns bore me, Larry. Nobody wins.
You can have the company.

50:59.930 --> 51:05.270
In fact, it'll be fun watching you and your
giant ego trying to make a horse race of it.

51:06.100 --> 51:09.110
Buddy, what's a fair price for that stock?

51:09.230 --> 51:12.440
The break-up value is higher. It's worth 80.

51:12.570 --> 51:17.570
Well, we don't want to be greedy.
So what do you say to 72?

51:19.870 --> 51:23.290
You're a two-bit pirate and greenmailer.
Nothing more...

51:24.040 --> 51:25.710
...Gekko.

51:27.040 --> 51:31.960
Not only would you sell your mother
to make a deal, you'd send her COD.

51:32.170 --> 51:36.010
My mail is the same colour as yours is, pal.

51:36.130 --> 51:39.970
Or at least it was until the Queen
started calling you "Sir".

51:41.350 --> 51:43.850
Excuse me before I lose my temper.

51:43.850 --> 51:45.520
71?

51:52.900 --> 51:55.950
Considering you brought my mother into it...

51:56.030 --> 51:57.700
...71.50.

52:02.290 --> 52:04.370
Done.

52:04.500 --> 52:08.120
You'll hear from my lawyers
tomorrow, 8am. Good night.

52:14.710 --> 52:18.340
He's right, I had to sell.
The key to the game is capital reserves.

52:18.470 --> 52:23.260
If you don't have enough, you can't piss
in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

52:23.260 --> 52:26.480
"All warfare is based on deception." Sun Tzu.

52:27.020 --> 52:30.230
"If your enemy is superior, evade him."

52:30.360 --> 52:32.730
"If angry, irritate him."

52:32.860 --> 52:38.280
"If equally matched, fight.
And if not, split. Re-evaluate."

52:39.110 --> 52:40.870
He's learning, huh? Buddy's learning!

52:53.045 --> 52:56.175
- Yeah?
- Money never sleeps, pal.

52:56.465 --> 53:00.005
Just made 800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
It's been wired to you.

53:00.635 --> 53:05.555
Play with it. You done good,
but you gotta keep doing good.

53:05.555 --> 53:08.895
I showed you how the game works.
Now school's out.

53:09.395 --> 53:12.025
Mr Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

53:12.105 --> 53:16.815
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.
I wanna be surprised.

53:18.065 --> 53:23.285
Astonish me, pal. New info.
I don't care where or how you get it.

53:23.785 --> 53:25.865
Just get it.

53:27.535 --> 53:31.085
My wife tells me you made a move on Darien.

53:32.255 --> 53:34.335
Here's some inside info for you.

53:34.335 --> 53:37.755
That GQ type she's going out with
got big bucks...

53:37.885 --> 53:40.465
...but he's putting her feet to sleep.

53:40.595 --> 53:43.305
Exit visas are imminent.

53:43.305 --> 53:46.435
I don't want you losing your place in line.

53:48.185 --> 53:50.265
Ah, Jesus!

53:50.605 --> 53:52.895
I wish you could see this.

53:53.605 --> 53:56.105
The light's coming up.

53:59.655 --> 54:03.745
I've never seen a painting that
captures the beauty of the ocean...

54:03.825 --> 54:06.115
...at a moment like this.

54:07.915 --> 54:10.625
I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox.

54:11.455 --> 54:15.625
Yeah. Rich enough
that you can afford a girl like Darien.

54:15.835 --> 54:18.335
This is your wake-up call, pal.

54:19.465 --> 54:21.545
Go to work.

54:36.985 --> 54:39.485
- Fox!
- Mr Barnes.

54:41.065 --> 54:45.535
Buddy D, is this déjá vu?
What's it been? A year, year and a half?

54:45.655 --> 54:48.245
So, I hear you're moving up in the world.

54:48.365 --> 54:52.535
A senior associate. Not bad. Not bad.
How's Margie?

54:52.625 --> 54:56.085
I can't complain.
I got a house in Oyster Bay, you know.

54:56.165 --> 54:58.375
Market treating you good?

54:58.465 --> 55:03.465
- Still seeing that sexy French chick?
- No. No. She asked the wrong question.

55:03.595 --> 55:06.595
- What was that?
- "What are you thinking?"

55:09.845 --> 55:14.225
The hours are hell, but the cash
is starting to tumble in.

55:14.225 --> 55:19.025
I know this guy who has an ironclad way
of making money. I can't lose or get hurt.

55:19.105 --> 55:23.905
Can't get hurt. So does this guy
have a tip for an honest lawyer?

55:24.325 --> 55:27.865
Maybe. Check out Teldar Paper...

55:28.405 --> 55:30.285
...but don't quote me.

55:31.205 --> 55:37.045
And you? I hear you're handling the Fairchild
Foods merger, and it may not go through.

55:37.165 --> 55:40.795
Any surprises I haven't read about
in the Wall Street Journal?

55:40.925 --> 55:44.545
Come on, that's illegal.
You wouldn't wanna get me disbarred.

55:44.675 --> 55:49.055
Who's listening?
Just one college buddy talking to another.

55:49.975 --> 55:53.855
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, relax, Roger.

55:53.855 --> 55:56.145
Everybody's doing it now.

55:56.645 --> 56:00.395
But, if you don't know,
then... you don't know.

56:06.155 --> 56:08.445
And if I did...

56:08.445 --> 56:10.745
...what's in it for moi?

56:12.205 --> 56:14.915
More money than you ever dreamed of.

56:15.835 --> 56:17.915
Nobody gets hurt.

56:19.585 --> 56:21.665
You think about it.

56:23.125 --> 56:28.465
- Let's grab a beer. What do you say?
- Uh... too much to do. But I'll walk you out.

56:30.425 --> 56:32.515
The file's on the desk, Marie.

56:32.635 --> 56:36.395
Get inside my uncle's door
and the secrets of the world are yours.

56:36.475 --> 56:38.265
Lifeblood of companies...

56:38.355 --> 56:42.235
Of course, you gotta go
to law school first, but...

56:58.995 --> 57:02.125
Mr Panos, I've been charting
the growth of office space.

57:02.255 --> 57:05.045
You're in the right business
at the right time.

57:05.175 --> 57:07.255
Thank you for tell me what I already know.

57:07.345 --> 57:11.215
Look, I'm very impressed with your work,
and I could use a tax break.

57:11.305 --> 57:15.265
Let me ask, what would you say to
some working capital and a partner?

57:15.395 --> 57:17.265
Why do I need a partner?

57:17.265 --> 57:21.725
Look, you need more vans. 42 employees
can't cover the buildings you got...

57:21.855 --> 57:24.445
...not to mention the clients
we'd have together.

57:24.565 --> 57:29.235
I am an expert at identifying undervalued
assets such as this business.

58:18.165 --> 58:21.165
The good news, Gordon,
is Rorker Electronics.

58:21.285 --> 58:24.415
That's right. I see it happening
in the next two months.

58:24.625 --> 58:27.215
Come on, their quarterlies are for shit.

58:27.835 --> 58:30.045
I got a little gift for you.

58:31.095 --> 58:34.845
Gordon will be very pleased.
What else have you got?

58:39.645 --> 58:41.515
You know Marty Weidman?

58:41.515 --> 58:45.275
He netted 650G off of that merger.
26 years old, the guy's Rambo.

58:45.355 --> 58:47.565
- He's an asshole!
- He is Rambo!

58:47.565 --> 58:50.565
He's got a Porsche Turbo
Cabriolet, about 75 thou.

58:50.695 --> 58:55.495
I think if I can make a bundle of cash
before I'm 30 and get out of this racket...

58:55.575 --> 58:58.825
...l'll be able to ride
my motorcycle across China.

58:59.665 --> 59:03.625
I'd like to do for furniture what
Laura Ashley did for interior fabrics.

59:03.705 --> 59:06.955
Produce a line of high-quality
antiques at a low price.

59:07.045 --> 59:09.255
Sounds great. I'll take you public.

59:09.335 --> 59:11.215
You will?

59:35.115 --> 59:37.615
Can I help you?

59:38.865 --> 59:41.365
Oh. Excuse me. Is this Bill Bates' office?

59:41.455 --> 59:42.825
No.

59:42.825 --> 59:44.785
I'm sorry.

59:55.215 --> 59:57.425
Hiya, Dad.

59:57.425 --> 01:00:01.055
- What brings you out here?
- Client's got a private jet at Butler.

01:00:01.185 --> 01:00:03.765
- Hey, Buddy. How ya doing?
- Mr Wall Street!

01:00:03.895 --> 01:00:05.975
The bozos that keep us in the air!

01:00:06.065 --> 01:00:08.565
- Give us a hand.
- Do an honest day's work.

01:00:08.685 --> 01:00:12.025
All right. Change the oil,
fill the tyres and park it out back.

01:00:12.105 --> 01:00:14.195
This kid wanna buy the plane?

01:00:14.315 --> 01:00:18.155
- You always light up when you see me.
- Don't start, all right?

01:00:18.285 --> 01:00:19.945
All right.

01:00:20.035 --> 01:00:22.245
So who peed in your Cheerios?

01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:25.165
Goddamn fare wars are killing us!

01:00:25.245 --> 01:00:28.495
Management's gonna lay off
five of my men this week.

01:00:28.585 --> 01:00:30.465
I'm sorry about that.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:34.545
- So how much you need?
- I don't need anything. I'm doing great.

01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:37.885
New client, new ball game.
Things are starting to happen.

01:00:37.965 --> 01:00:40.805
Sure. Lots of guys at the track talk like that.

01:00:40.885 --> 01:00:45.685
How do you know you'll have any dough
next month? Jesus Christ, what is this?

01:00:45.805 --> 01:00:47.685
It's a dividend.

01:00:47.765 --> 01:00:50.685
I've borrowed at least five grand
over the years.

01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:54.235
Oh, stop it.
Put this towards your school loan.

01:00:54.355 --> 01:00:59.155
Forget the loans. Look, Dad, things
are good and it's gonna stay that way.

01:00:59.235 --> 01:01:02.155
- Buy yourself a new suit.
- What do I need a suit for?

01:01:02.285 --> 01:01:05.495
I don't hobnob with the jet set.
I just fix their planes.

01:01:05.625 --> 01:01:10.835
Then get a decent bowling jacket, so you
don't look like the Roto-Rooter man.

01:01:10.915 --> 01:01:13.335
Come on, what's money for? Enjoy yourself.

01:01:13.415 --> 01:01:16.545
Money is a pain in the ass,
if you ask me. But thanks, kid.

01:01:16.675 --> 01:01:19.385
- How about dinner?
- Sure. Any night this week.

01:01:19.385 --> 01:01:21.765
OK. No, I'm sorry. This week's booked.

01:01:21.885 --> 01:01:26.145
- I'll check with my girl. I'll get back to you.
- You do that, Huckleberry.

01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:28.975
I gotta run. You stop smoking, you hear?

01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:30.935
I'll talk at ya.

01:01:33.985 --> 01:01:35.655
Whoo! Oh!

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:49.835
It's in both our interests to put
a safe distance between you and us.

01:01:49.835 --> 01:01:52.335
- You understand that, Mr Fox?
- Sure.

01:01:53.165 --> 01:01:57.135
This gives you limited power of attorney
for Mr Gekko's account.

01:01:57.135 --> 01:02:01.095
Every ticket you buy must be
marked "power of attorney".

01:02:01.095 --> 01:02:03.385
That means that you call the shots.

01:02:03.465 --> 01:02:08.055
Mr Gekko has no official knowledge
of what stocks you're buying. All right?

01:02:08.185 --> 01:02:10.895
Just sign it at the end, twice.

01:02:11.935 --> 01:02:15.275
I never knew how poor I was
until I started making money.

01:02:15.275 --> 01:02:18.195
Your transactions will be
monitored by StockWatch.

01:02:18.695 --> 01:02:22.025
If any trouble does arise,
you are on your own out there.

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.445
The trail stops with you, understand?

01:02:24.745 --> 01:02:28.495
Spread the buy orders over
different accounts, you won't get burnt.

01:02:28.615 --> 01:02:31.335
I have friends that won't
mind making easy money.

01:02:31.335 --> 01:02:37.375
- Rudy Gazoodi! How's my cutie?! Viens ici!

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:39.005
We need more votes for the
showdown, but don't wanna go public...

01:02:38.975 --> 01:02:41.515
We need more votes for the
showdown, but don't wanna go public...

01:02:41.605 --> 01:02:44.855
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:48.275
Oh! He speaks French already.

01:02:48.405 --> 01:02:51.115
Kid had the highest score in his IQ test.

01:02:51.115 --> 01:02:54.865
It is so difficult to get into
a good nursery school now.

01:02:57.455 --> 01:03:00.705
They even go to your home
to make sure you're acceptable.

01:03:00.785 --> 01:03:03.415
That's it for you with the grown-ups.

01:03:03.495 --> 01:03:06.835
- Nicole, would you take him for a nap now?
- Viens, mon petit.

01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:10.385
Give him a bath and put that
cute little black suit on him.

01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:13.635
This is a contact at one of our offshore banks.

01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:17.385
On settlement day you'll open
an account for Mr Gekko...

01:03:17.385 --> 01:03:19.975
...under the name Geneva Roth Holding Corp.

01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:25.105
Then you'll wire-transfer the money
to this account in the Cayman Islands.

01:03:25.185 --> 01:03:27.815
You're gonna make a lot of money, pal.

01:03:28.525 --> 01:03:31.655
The stakes are going up. No mistakes.

01:03:33.025 --> 01:03:35.115
Piece of cake, Gordon.

01:03:50.425 --> 01:03:52.845
If I could have anything...

01:03:52.845 --> 01:03:55.345
...this would almost do.

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.845
Almost.

01:03:59.095 --> 01:04:01.685
How'd your conference go with Gordon?

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:06.815
It went fine. We reached an agreement,
and decided to split up the world between us.

01:04:08.275 --> 01:04:12.025
You have modest wants.
I like that in a man.

01:04:12.025 --> 01:04:15.575
- What do you want?
- Let's see.

01:04:15.575 --> 01:04:19.955
A Turner. A perfect canary diamond.

01:04:20.035 --> 01:04:21.915
World peace.

01:04:22.035 --> 01:04:23.915
The best of everything.

01:04:23.995 --> 01:04:25.795
Well, why stop at that?

01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:27.545
I don't.

01:04:43.185 --> 01:04:47.895
My client wants to buy a large block
of Teldar. He needs to spread it around.

01:04:47.895 --> 01:04:51.445
I'll park some money in your account.
If it hits, you get a big cut.

01:04:51.445 --> 01:04:55.405
I'm telling you, this is the easiest
money you've ever made.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.905
All right, Bud.

01:04:57.985 --> 01:05:00.075
Let's do it.

01:05:00.405 --> 01:05:02.495
We go way back, Harry.

01:05:02.575 --> 01:05:06.955
You know, I-I-I've put a lot of money
into this firm over the years.

01:05:07.085 --> 01:05:10.505
- I brought in a lot of business.
- You've taken enough out, too.

01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:15.925
- You should have something put aside.
- With the divorces I haven't had a chance.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:20.515
- The bridges are burned.
- When you fire me I'm finished. On the street.

01:05:20.635 --> 01:05:23.975
- How do you think I feel about this?
- How do you think I feel?

01:05:23.975 --> 01:05:26.895
I've got responsibilities. I've got two kids...

01:05:26.975 --> 01:05:29.065
What's going on?

01:05:29.185 --> 01:05:32.945
Lynch is giving him the boot.
Not pulling his quota.

01:05:34.405 --> 01:05:36.905
We're all one trade away from humility.

01:05:36.985 --> 01:05:41.575
New report on GM and a conference call
in defence stock in my office, 7 am tomorrow.

01:05:41.695 --> 01:05:44.415
No RSVP required. Just be there.

01:05:45.035 --> 01:05:49.205
Now, on a more inspiring note,
the new office record...

01:05:49.205 --> 01:05:54.215
...for a single month's gross commission
from the wealthy individual accounts...

01:05:54.295 --> 01:05:58.255
...goes to Bud Fox.
Shows cold calling does work, fellas.

01:05:58.385 --> 01:06:01.305
Way to go, Bud. Superjob. Come on up here.

01:06:01.385 --> 01:06:06.095
Bud, congrats. You just made my life
twice as hard around here.

01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:15.985
You're on a roll, kid. Enjoy it
while it lasts, cos it never does.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:18.825
Just kicking ass and taking names, Lou.

01:06:33.415 --> 01:06:35.925
Come along with me, Bud.

01:06:41.005 --> 01:06:43.095
This is yours now, Bud.

01:06:43.215 --> 01:06:45.725
Credenza. Tree. Windows.

01:06:45.805 --> 01:06:50.105
And, significantly more attractive,
your private secretary Janet.

01:06:50.185 --> 01:06:52.895
- Nice to meet you, Mr Fox.
- Hello, Janet.

01:06:54.065 --> 01:06:57.905
Well, I don't really know what to say.
Thank you, Mr Lynch.

01:06:58.025 --> 01:06:59.695
No, I thank you, Bud.

01:06:59.775 --> 01:07:03.865
The minute I laid my eyes on you
I knew that you had what it takes.

01:07:04.075 --> 01:07:06.995
Now you can focus on the big-ticket retail.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:10.955
Oh, this is very nice. This is very nice.

01:07:11.245 --> 01:07:14.295
So what is it? Mr Cocksucker now?

01:07:16.585 --> 01:07:20.005
Everybody hates the Upper East Side.
They wanna live on the West Side.

01:07:20.135 --> 01:07:24.595
But when it's resale time
the East Side moves all the time.

01:07:24.715 --> 01:07:28.265
What have you got on the West Side?
Sean and Madonna?! Trust me.

01:07:28.555 --> 01:07:33.265
Massage, sauna, Jacuzzi... tanning salon.

01:07:34.815 --> 01:07:37.445
Best schools in the city.

01:07:37.525 --> 01:07:42.235
A cute young boy like you gotta think
of a future lady friend in your life...

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:44.945
...when you've finished wolfing around.

01:07:45.035 --> 01:07:47.115
Course, I'm taken.

01:07:47.245 --> 01:07:49.325
Oak strip floors.

01:07:49.325 --> 01:07:51.625
My husband can get you a 10% mortgage.

01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:55.585
I would do it myself, except
I'm into four other deals right now.

01:07:56.085 --> 01:08:01.635
So, I got a four o'clock and a five. One's an
all-cash type. Monique something or other.

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:07.135
Look, maybe you'd like to see something
cheaper that I got on First Avenue?

01:08:07.265 --> 01:08:10.805
Honey, the meter's running. Anybody home?

01:08:12.265 --> 01:08:15.065
All right. Offer 950.

01:08:18.185 --> 01:08:20.694
I got something over on Sutton Place.

01:08:20.814 --> 01:08:24.444
It's a million and a half,
but now we're talking duplex.

01:08:24.575 --> 01:08:26.115
No.

01:08:26.325 --> 01:08:29.035
This is it. This is home.

01:08:58.354 --> 01:09:00.944
That's enough gold over there.

01:09:22.215 --> 01:09:24.295
Like it?

01:09:25.965 --> 01:09:31.515
I'm having House & Garden come up next
week to photograph it before it gets lived in.

01:09:31.595 --> 01:09:32.635
Do you mind?

01:09:34.015 --> 01:09:36.935
Hey! Jerry! Come at me. Whaddaya got?

01:09:37.015 --> 01:09:39.524
No, no. 37 1/2.

01:09:39.645 --> 01:09:44.524
Convert the bonds and check the price
in Tokyo at eight o'clock your time. Right.

01:10:07.385 --> 01:10:09.675
I'm spilling everything.

01:10:40.955 --> 01:10:43.045
Isn't it perfect?

01:10:43.665 --> 01:10:45.755
It's too perfect.

01:10:46.045 --> 01:10:48.045
Let's not even eat.

01:10:48.135 --> 01:10:50.965
Let's just watch it... think about it.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:40.685
Who am I?

01:11:50.815 --> 01:11:52.905
Bud, come to bed.

01:11:57.995 --> 01:11:59.865
One million six. Seven.

01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:04.245
On my left now.
Against you, 1,800,000.

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:08.125
1,900,000. New bidder this side.
$2m here now.

01:12:08.215 --> 01:12:11.965
Not yours. At $2,100,000. $2,100,000.

01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:15.425
Fair warning, then.
Selling for $2,100,000. All done.

01:12:15.515 --> 01:12:17.925
For you, sir. $2,100,000.

01:12:18.845 --> 01:12:21.475
Whaddaya say we get a suite at the Carlyle?

01:12:21.555 --> 01:12:25.435
Champagne, caviar...?
Celebrate just like old times?

01:12:25.525 --> 01:12:28.435
Come on, Gordon. Those days are over.

01:12:28.565 --> 01:12:31.485
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

01:12:31.565 --> 01:12:34.905
You're as beautiful as
that painting I just bought.

01:12:35.735 --> 01:12:40.745
Sunshine, what's wrong?
I think you got a bad case of puppy love.

01:12:40.865 --> 01:12:43.245
I think I'm falling for Bud.

01:12:43.785 --> 01:12:47.415
Don't fall too far. He hasn't been
around the block yet. You have.

01:12:48.795 --> 01:12:52.755
- Told him about us?
- No! Are you crazy?

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:57.135
- I don't want him to ever know, understand?
- Mum is the word.

01:12:59.225 --> 01:13:01.385
You and I are the same, Darien.

01:13:01.515 --> 01:13:06.105
We are smart enough not to buy
into the oldest myth running-love.

01:13:06.725 --> 01:13:11.315
Fiction created by people to keep
them from jumping out of windows.

01:13:11.315 --> 01:13:16.195
You know, sometimes I miss you, Gordon.
You're really twisted.

01:13:18.825 --> 01:13:20.905
For chrissake, Jack, it's easy!

01:13:20.995 --> 01:13:25.165
On settlement day you endorse a cheque
to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company.

01:13:25.285 --> 01:13:27.375
Then I'll send you your cut.

01:13:28.205 --> 01:13:31.965
What? No, that's the bottom line.
Nobody gets hurt.

01:13:32.465 --> 01:13:34.545
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:13:34.675 --> 01:13:39.135
It's so bad, even the liars are complaining.
But not you. You're making big money.

01:13:39.265 --> 01:13:41.425
- What's the bottom line?
- Hey, look!

01:13:41.555 --> 01:13:45.605
I am sick and tired of playing
wet nurse to you!

01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:50.735
- Will you do your own homework, Marv!
- What an asshole, man!

01:13:51.355 --> 01:13:53.445
That's a shame.

01:13:56.155 --> 01:14:01.365
Yeah, Frank. Work 500,000 shares Teldar
with a limit of 26. New account.

01:14:01.445 --> 01:14:03.535
Don't fuck it up.

01:14:05.205 --> 01:14:07.415
- How's Teldar doing?
- Back again?

01:14:07.415 --> 01:14:11.375
- I've got a real appetite.
- Bring it five to a half. 2,000 up.

01:14:11.455 --> 01:14:15.545
- I gotta buy stock. What's offered at a half?
- What are we looking at?

01:14:15.635 --> 01:14:18.135
- Make me an offer on 80.
- 80,000 at a half.

01:14:18.255 --> 01:14:19.925
I'll take it.

01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:49.745
Your company, ladies and gentlemen,
is under siege from Gordon Gekko.

01:14:49.745 --> 01:14:55.045
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt,
like some piss-poor South American country!

01:14:55.375 --> 01:15:01.005
I strongly recommend you to see through
Mr Gekko's shameless intention here...

01:15:01.005 --> 01:15:05.805
...to strip this company,
and severely penalise the stockholders.

01:15:05.885 --> 01:15:09.015
I strongly recommend you
to reject his tender...

01:15:09.355 --> 01:15:14.435
...by voting for management's
restructuring of the stock.

01:15:23.325 --> 01:15:27.285
Well, I appreciate the opportunity
you're giving me, Mr Cromwell...

01:15:27.365 --> 01:15:31.455
...as the single largest shareholder
in Teldar Paper, to speak.

01:15:33.545 --> 01:15:39.795
We are not here to indulge in fantasy,
but in political and economic reality.

01:15:40.845 --> 01:15:46.345
America... America
has become a second-rate power.

01:15:47.725 --> 01:15:53.225
Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit
are at nightmare proportions.

01:15:54.475 --> 01:15:58.855
In the days of the free market, when
our country was a top industrial power...

01:15:59.065 --> 01:16:02.405
...there was accountability to the stockholder.

01:16:02.945 --> 01:16:08.575
The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men
that built this great empire, made sure of it...

01:16:08.655 --> 01:16:11.285
...because it was their money at stake.

01:16:11.495 --> 01:16:15.545
Today, management
has no stake in the company!

01:16:16.915 --> 01:16:22.005
All together, these men sitting up here
own less than 3% of the company.

01:16:22.135 --> 01:16:26.095
And where does Mr Cromwell
put his $1,000,000 salary?

01:16:26.095 --> 01:16:29.845
Not in Teldar stock. He owns less than 1%.

01:16:29.935 --> 01:16:34.015
You own the company.
That's right, you, the stockholder.

01:16:34.105 --> 01:16:38.485
And you are all being royally
screwed over by these bureaucrats...

01:16:38.605 --> 01:16:44.655
...with their steak lunches, their fishing trips,
their corporate jets and golden parachutes.

01:16:44.655 --> 01:16:47.245
This is an outrage! You're out of line, Gekko!

01:16:47.365 --> 01:16:53.205
Teldar Paper, Mr Cromwell,
has 33 different vice presidents...

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:57.795
...each earning over $200,000 a year.

01:16:59.255 --> 01:17:04.675
Now, I have spent the last two months
analysing what all these guys do.

01:17:05.295 --> 01:17:08.015
- And I still can't figure it out.

01:17:08.095 --> 01:17:14.055
One thing I do know is that
our paper company lost $110m last year.

01:17:14.145 --> 01:17:19.895
And I'll bet half of that was spent in all the
paperwork between all these vice presidents!

01:17:21.985 --> 01:17:25.525
The new law of evolution
in corporate America...

01:17:25.615 --> 01:17:29.575
...seems to be... survival of the unfittest.

01:17:30.825 --> 01:17:34.995
Well, in my book you either do it right,
or you get eliminated.

01:17:37.415 --> 01:17:42.715
In the last seven deals that I have been
involved with there were 2.5m stockholders...

01:17:42.835 --> 01:17:47.305
...who have made a pre-tax profit
of $12 billion.

01:17:48.555 --> 01:17:49.715
Thank you.

01:17:51.885 --> 01:17:55.145
I am not a destroyer of companies.

01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:57.725
I am a liberator of them!

01:18:00.225 --> 01:18:06.405
The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
that greed, for lack of a better word...

01:18:06.485 --> 01:18:08.365
...is good.

01:18:08.485 --> 01:18:11.695
Greed is right. Greed works.

01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:19.415
Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures
the essence of the evolutionary spirit.

01:18:19.545 --> 01:18:26.635
Greed, in all of its forms-greed for life,
for money, for love, knowledge -

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:29.425
...has marked the upward surge of mankind.

01:18:29.555 --> 01:18:36.225
And greed, you mark my words,
will not only save Teldar Paper...

01:18:36.225 --> 01:18:40.395
...but that other malfunctioning
corporation called the USA.

01:18:40.475 --> 01:18:42.775
Thank you very much.

01:18:58.325 --> 01:19:00.495
Buy me 20 June eurodollar CDs...

01:19:00.625 --> 01:19:05.625
...20 March gold and sell 10 September
Deutschmarks. Right. Talk at ya, babe.

01:19:07.085 --> 01:19:12.595
Ah, Buddy, Buddy, I hate to tell you this,
but you are a genius!

01:19:13.135 --> 01:19:15.435
Darien! Lightning has struck.

01:19:15.515 --> 01:19:19.055
The light bulb has been invented.
Bluestar Airlines.

01:19:19.185 --> 01:19:22.315
Edison, da Vinci, Einstein.
They're all watching me.

01:19:22.395 --> 01:19:24.605
Ever hear of the 60-hour work week?

01:19:24.685 --> 01:19:28.865
You've gotta go to work soon. I'm getting
psychotic from a lack of REM sleep.

01:19:28.985 --> 01:19:31.275
I'm not gonna broker the rest of my life.

01:19:31.365 --> 01:19:36.575
I am gonna be a giant, an entrepreneur
in the Italian 16th-century sense of the word.

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:40.665
A mover, a shaker.
I'm shooting for the stars, Darien.

01:19:40.665 --> 01:19:43.245
You're coming along for the ride.

01:19:45.545 --> 01:19:48.675
Bluestar is an unpolished gem, Gordon.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:53.055
A half-assed management being decimated
by a price war they cannot win.

01:19:53.175 --> 01:19:56.305
But the gates at La Guardia alone
can bail us out.

01:19:56.385 --> 01:20:00.685
If it's worth a dime, it's worth 10 bucks
a share. They're ripe to fall!

01:20:00.685 --> 01:20:02.645
Mixed emotions, Buddy.

01:20:02.765 --> 01:20:07.775
Like Larry Wildman going off
a cliff... in my new Maserati!

01:20:09.315 --> 01:20:12.865
Guys like me have had their asses hung
in a sling with the airlines!

01:20:12.985 --> 01:20:17.655
- Fuel could go up. Unions are killers.
- Yeah, but aren't you forgetting one thing?

01:20:17.785 --> 01:20:22.995
Capital reserves. This company has
75 million cash in an overfunded pension.

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:25.295
That buys us a lot of credibility.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:28.835
And the beauty is, you already
own close to 2% of this sucker.

01:20:28.835 --> 01:20:33.715
The insurance people are balking on the
logging trucks. What do you want to do?

01:20:33.845 --> 01:20:37.675
Tell those assholes
we'll self-insure if they don't write it.

01:20:37.805 --> 01:20:42.055
I can't believe we can fire half
the management and nothing changes!

01:20:44.895 --> 01:20:49.485
Gordon, what I want,
and I've never asked you for anything...

01:20:49.565 --> 01:20:52.275
...is to be your copilot on this one.

01:20:52.905 --> 01:20:58.035
I wanna take this airline, turn it around and
make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune.

01:21:00.745 --> 01:21:06.165
I got a stockbroker who wants an airline. It'll
take two years to turn Teldar Paper around.

01:21:06.165 --> 01:21:10.545
What do I need a dink airline for? I'm up
to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake!

01:21:10.755 --> 01:21:15.005
I've worked at Bluestar. I know my way
around. I have friends there, inside.

01:21:15.635 --> 01:21:17.715
What do you mean?

01:21:17.845 --> 01:21:22.305
The three unions.
It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget.

01:21:22.435 --> 01:21:27.525
The hourly cost of a flight crew is 850
an hour. That's the real hidden value, GG.

01:21:27.645 --> 01:21:32.025
If you can negotiate that out,
get a crew down to 350, 400 an hour...

01:21:32.105 --> 01:21:35.235
...this airline'll be the hottest thing
since Texas Air.

01:21:35.365 --> 01:21:40.155
- What makes you think you can?
- I can talk to these people. They trust me.

01:21:40.245 --> 01:21:43.165
My father can be a big help in getting cuts.

01:21:49.755 --> 01:21:54.005
All right. Susan, get Buckingham
on the phone. Tell him to look into it.

01:21:54.755 --> 01:21:57.345
So the falcon's heard the falconer, huh?

01:22:12.695 --> 01:22:14.565
- Hi, Dad.
- Sorry I'm late.

01:22:14.655 --> 01:22:17.275
That's OK. Overdressed as usual.

01:22:18.945 --> 01:22:23.325
Come on in. Everybody's here.
I couldn't start the show without you.

01:22:24.785 --> 01:22:26.955
Well, I'll be a lousy Republican!

01:22:27.085 --> 01:22:31.255
I decorate for Democrats, too.
Lots of them. I'm Darien Taylor.

01:22:31.335 --> 01:22:34.375
- Bud's told me all about you.
- Don't believe a word.

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:36.885
I never beat him or locked him in a closet.

01:22:36.965 --> 01:22:39.595
- I forgot about the closet.
- He turned out OK.

01:22:39.675 --> 01:22:42.725
Bud's a born liar, otherwise he's a good kid.

01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:46.555
I hope you come here more often,
under less formal circumstances.

01:22:46.685 --> 01:22:48.225
Thank you.

01:22:48.355 --> 01:22:51.275
- Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore.
- Sure. How are ya?

01:22:51.355 --> 01:22:54.895
Pilots' union.
Toni Carpenter, flight attendants'.

01:22:55.025 --> 01:22:57.115
I'd like you to meet Mr Gekko.

01:22:57.195 --> 01:22:59.405
Mr Fox, pleasure to meet you.

01:22:59.615 --> 01:23:01.695
His attorney, Mr Salt.

01:23:01.785 --> 01:23:05.245
I'd be proud to have a son like Buddy.
Got a hell of a career in front of him.

01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:10.245
I'm glad you think so. I thought this was
informal. What's your attorney doing here?

01:23:10.245 --> 01:23:13.795
Harold, you don't mind walking
around the block, do you?

01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:16.505
- Of course.
- I'll take that.

01:23:16.505 --> 01:23:18.255
No offence.

01:23:18.385 --> 01:23:20.465
None taken.

01:23:25.265 --> 01:23:27.975
That's OK, Gordon. Bud does it all the time.

01:23:29.645 --> 01:23:35.355
Look, I got no illusions about
winning a popularity contest with any of you.

01:23:35.985 --> 01:23:37.985
I got roasted the other night.

01:23:37.985 --> 01:23:43.195
A friend asked "Why are we honouring this
man? Did we run out of human beings?"

01:23:44.035 --> 01:23:48.075
It's not always the most popular guy
who gets the job done.

01:23:51.335 --> 01:23:54.955
You've got losses of $20-30 million,
dividends cut to zero...

01:23:55.085 --> 01:23:58.005
...and you're being squeezed
to death by the majors.

01:23:58.085 --> 01:24:04.055
The management may not be the worst scum,
but they put you on this kamikaze course...

01:24:04.135 --> 01:24:08.725
...and pretty soon everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes.

01:24:08.845 --> 01:24:11.355
Only there's not enough to go around.

01:24:11.435 --> 01:24:14.355
Management has them. You don't.

01:24:16.355 --> 01:24:19.905
If they throw Bluestar to Chapter 11,
which I think they will...

01:24:19.985 --> 01:24:25.615
...they'll use the bankruptcy laws to break
your unions, and throw you off the property.

01:24:25.745 --> 01:24:30.745
Oh, come on! With all due respect, what's
to prevent you from doing the same thing?

01:24:30.745 --> 01:24:33.035
Cos I got a way around all this...

01:24:33.125 --> 01:24:37.625
...where we can all make money
and make the airline profitable.

01:24:38.045 --> 01:24:40.755
So what do you say we cut to the chase?

01:24:42.005 --> 01:24:48.685
I'm asking for a modest 20% across-the-board
wage cut, and seven more hours a month.

01:24:50.015 --> 01:24:52.305
What kind of time frame?

01:24:52.435 --> 01:24:55.775
A year. If we're still losing money,
the reduction stands.

01:24:55.855 --> 01:25:00.775
If we're in the black, I'll return part of the
givebacks, pay goes back to current levels...

01:25:00.855 --> 01:25:06.825
...and we initiate an employee
profit-sharing programme with stock.

01:25:06.905 --> 01:25:10.575
- You'll own part of the airline.
- Will you put it in writing?

01:25:10.665 --> 01:25:14.125
I'll have a letter of agreement
drafted up in two days.

01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:18.375
What's your marketing strategy?
How will you return us to profitability?

01:25:18.505 --> 01:25:21.835
Why don't I give Buddy an opportunity
to answer that? Buddy?

01:25:21.925 --> 01:25:24.135
Thank you, Gordon.

01:25:24.135 --> 01:25:27.885
First, I want you all to know
that my door will always be open...

01:25:27.885 --> 01:25:32.055
...because I know from my dad
it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying.

01:25:32.145 --> 01:25:36.015
What I've come up with here
is a basic three-point plan.

01:25:36.015 --> 01:25:40.605
One: we modernise. Our computer
software is dogshit. We update it.

01:25:40.695 --> 01:25:43.525
We squeeze every dollar
out of each mile flown.

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:47.365
Don't sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when he's willing to pay 379.

01:25:47.485 --> 01:25:53.745
Effective inventory management
will increase our load factor by 5-20%.

01:25:53.745 --> 01:25:57.995
That translates to approximately
$50-200 million in revenues.

01:25:58.335 --> 01:26:01.545
The point being,
we can beat the majors at a price war.

01:26:01.665 --> 01:26:05.925
Two: advertising. More, and aggressive.
We attack the majors.

01:26:06.045 --> 01:26:10.515
Three: expansion. We expand our hubs
to Atlanta, North Carolina and St Louis.

01:26:10.635 --> 01:26:13.635
And we reorganise all
of our feeder schedules.

01:26:13.765 --> 01:26:17.515
We gotta think big, guys.
We're going after the majors.

01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:23.025
Well, cards on the table, guys.
What do you say?

01:26:23.145 --> 01:26:27.615
Well, if you mean what you say,
I think we're probably in the ballpark.

01:26:27.735 --> 01:26:31.075
- I guess I can take it to my people.
- Good.

01:26:31.155 --> 01:26:34.825
You've sketched broad strokes.
I'd like to see the fine print.

01:26:34.915 --> 01:26:37.125
But I like what I hear so far.

01:26:42.005 --> 01:26:47.845
I guess if a man lives long enough he gets
to see everything, and I do mean everything.

01:26:47.965 --> 01:26:51.595
What else you got
in your bag of tricks, Mr Gekko?

01:26:52.845 --> 01:26:58.895
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more,
but, if you have any suggestions, I'll listen.

01:26:59.015 --> 01:27:02.145
"There came into Egypt
a Pharaoh who did not know."

01:27:02.145 --> 01:27:06.105
- I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
- No, a prophecy.

01:27:06.195 --> 01:27:09.235
The rich have been doing it
to the poor since time began.

01:27:09.325 --> 01:27:13.495
The only difference is
the Egyptians didn't allow unions.

01:27:13.615 --> 01:27:15.995
I know what this guy's all about-greed.

01:27:16.115 --> 01:27:21.125
He don't care about Bluestar or the unions.
He's in for the buck. He don't take prisoners.

01:27:21.415 --> 01:27:22.795
Wait a minute, Dad.

01:27:22.875 --> 01:27:26.835
Sure. What's worth doing
is worth doing for money.

01:27:26.965 --> 01:27:31.965
It's a bad bargain if nobody gains.
And if we do this deal, everybody gains.

01:27:32.055 --> 01:27:36.765
Course, my son worked as a baggage handler
and freight loader for three summers.

01:27:36.845 --> 01:27:40.105
With those qualifications,
he can run an airline!

01:27:40.395 --> 01:27:42.895
Fine. Stay with the present management...

01:27:43.025 --> 01:27:46.645
...dedicated to running you and
your airline into the ground.

01:27:46.985 --> 01:27:52.485
That "scum" built the company up with one
plane and made something out of nothing.

01:27:52.615 --> 01:27:58.455
If that's a scum, I'll take it over a rat any day.
You know where I stand. Good night, all.

01:28:04.705 --> 01:28:06.795
Excuse me.

01:28:09.795 --> 01:28:15.015
Congratulations, Dad! You did a great job
embarrassing me, not to mention yourself!

01:28:15.345 --> 01:28:19.095
Save the "workers unite" speech.
I heard it too much growing up!

01:28:19.095 --> 01:28:22.435
- Oh, yeah?
- You'll get axed. No two ways about it.

01:28:22.435 --> 01:28:26.065
You and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes!

01:28:26.185 --> 01:28:29.605
And if it isn't Gekko,
it's gonna be some other killer!

01:28:34.945 --> 01:28:40.165
He's using you, kid. He's got your prick
in his pocket, but you're too blind to see it.

01:28:40.245 --> 01:28:42.875
No. I see a jealous old machinist...

01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:46.835
...who can't stand the fact that his son's
more successful than he is!

01:28:46.835 --> 01:28:52.465
What you see is a guy who never measured
a man's success by the size of his wallet!

01:28:52.545 --> 01:28:58.095
That's because you never had the guts to go
out into the world and stake your own claim!

01:29:06.855 --> 01:29:11.855
Boy, if that's the way you feel,
I must've done a really lousy job as a father.

01:29:16.535 --> 01:29:18.825
As far as being axed, I'm still around...

01:29:18.955 --> 01:29:22.495
...and I have a responsibility
to the union membership I represent.

01:29:22.575 --> 01:29:26.665
Your responsibility is to present the facts,
not opinions, to your men.

01:29:26.745 --> 01:29:30.005
You'll destroy their lives.
Let them decide for themselves.

01:29:30.085 --> 01:29:34.465
My men will want to know what's
going on, and I won't lie to them!

01:29:34.595 --> 01:29:37.385
Oh, yeah, your men! Your fuckin' men!

01:29:37.515 --> 01:29:40.725
All my life your men have
been able to count on you!

01:29:40.845 --> 01:29:43.555
Why have you never been there for me?!

01:29:44.395 --> 01:29:46.265
What if you're wrong?

01:29:46.265 --> 01:29:52.195
What if one day the sun didn't rise in the
east, and for once your compass was off?

01:29:52.315 --> 01:29:55.865
Would you be willing to wreck
your men's future? My future?

01:29:55.945 --> 01:30:01.285
Dad, think for a change. Be practical.
I'm asking you. I'm fuckin' begging you!

01:30:02.535 --> 01:30:05.955
I don't go to sleep with no whore
and I don't wake up with no whore.

01:30:06.085 --> 01:30:09.915
That's how I live with myself.
I don't know how you do it.

01:30:10.045 --> 01:30:15.045
I hope I'm wrong about this guy...
but I'll let the men decide for themselves.

01:30:15.135 --> 01:30:17.425
That much I promise you.

01:30:43.495 --> 01:30:47.665
You should look at this, Chief.
A guy at Jackson Steinem...

01:30:47.785 --> 01:30:52.465
...buying large chunks of Teldar Paper
for an offshore account.

01:30:57.465 --> 01:30:59.675
So, what's the problema?

01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:02.885
- Do you know what the fuck the problem is?
- What?

01:31:03.515 --> 01:31:06.145
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

01:31:06.145 --> 01:31:09.975
I get a strange call from the SEC.
They asked to see my records.

01:31:10.105 --> 01:31:13.855
- This is heavy, Bud.
- Hey, hey, hey, relax! Relax, Roger.

01:31:15.105 --> 01:31:18.235
You're 82M in the account numbers
and I'm the invisible man.

01:31:18.235 --> 01:31:20.535
Well, that's good for you, Bud.

01:31:20.615 --> 01:31:25.325
They're always looking for red flags.
Gekko's always getting checked by 'em.

01:31:25.415 --> 01:31:28.125
They never come up with anything, Rog.

01:31:29.995 --> 01:31:33.455
Hey... we're invulnerable on this one.

01:31:34.295 --> 01:31:37.085
I just wanna slow down, Bud.

01:31:37.215 --> 01:31:38.675
All right?

01:31:38.755 --> 01:31:43.885
No more lunches, no calls, all right?
We suspend our business, all right?

01:31:43.975 --> 01:31:46.685
Whatever you want, Rog. It's cool.

01:31:47.015 --> 01:31:50.565
Excuse me. Hey, Rog, can you come
back in? Bring the cost report.

01:31:50.565 --> 01:31:52.645
We're starting again.

01:31:54.735 --> 01:31:58.905
Gekko's asked us into the Bluestar deal.
We're reviewing timetables.

01:31:58.985 --> 01:32:02.735
- You wanna come?
- He didn't tell me about that.

01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:08.495
You're only the president of the company.
What the hell do you know anyway, right?

01:32:18.505 --> 01:32:21.295
Guys, new chief of Bluestar - Bud Fox.

01:32:21.425 --> 01:32:23.305
- Hi.
- Hello, Bud.

01:32:23.305 --> 01:32:26.305
Guys, what's the problem? It's time to kill.

01:32:27.135 --> 01:32:31.935
Gekko's got 12% of the stock and climbing.
Plus he's got the unions in his back pocket.

01:32:32.065 --> 01:32:36.645
Everybody knows the stock's in play.
By next week the street will own Bluestar.

01:32:36.735 --> 01:32:38.815
Is the bank financing in place?

01:32:39.025 --> 01:32:43.735
Or are we gonna sit around and have
more of these ridiculous meetings?

01:32:43.825 --> 01:32:49.035
Our firm committed weeks ago 25%
of the total long-term debt structure.

01:32:49.245 --> 01:32:52.915
Unless you guys sign
this piece of paper right now...

01:32:52.995 --> 01:32:56.455
...l'm gonna pull and go to
another bank for the 75.

01:32:57.085 --> 01:33:03.345
Look, we've got 30 banks ready to participate
in a four-year revolving credit line.

01:33:03.425 --> 01:33:10.305
We must have your assurance you will pay
back most of the loan in the first 12 months.

01:33:10.845 --> 01:33:16.355
The only way we can see this happening
is liquidating the hangars and the planes.

01:33:16.475 --> 01:33:20.315
Can you people guarantee
the liquidation of Bluestar?

01:33:20.445 --> 01:33:22.525
Guarantee? No sweat!

01:33:22.615 --> 01:33:26.485
We got the Bleezburgs lined up
to build condos where the hangars are.

01:33:26.575 --> 01:33:30.535
We lay the airplanes off to the Mexicans,
who are dumb enough to buy 'em!

01:33:30.665 --> 01:33:34.835
And I got the Texas boys drooling
at my kneecaps for the routes and slots.

01:33:34.835 --> 01:33:37.415
What's your problem? It's done!

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:41.295
Here's the price tags
on the 737s, gates, hangars, routes.

01:33:41.375 --> 01:33:44.635
We got it nailed right down
to the typewriters.

01:33:44.635 --> 01:33:47.765
The beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension.

01:33:47.765 --> 01:33:51.185
Gekko makes $75m there.

01:33:51.515 --> 01:33:55.975
50 million buys him the minimum
annuities for 6,000 employees...

01:33:56.105 --> 01:34:03.275
...and he walks away with the rest.
I figure he'll make... He'll clear $60-70m.

01:34:03.405 --> 01:34:05.905
Not bad for a month's work.

01:34:07.155 --> 01:34:09.865
Your boy really did his homework, Fox.

01:34:09.865 --> 01:34:15.165
And you'll have the shortest executive
career since that Pope that got poisoned.

01:34:15.285 --> 01:34:19.545
Now he'll really start believing
he's Gekko the Great.

01:34:20.915 --> 01:34:23.925
- He'd like to change that appointment.
- Hold this.

01:34:24.045 --> 01:34:26.425
Bud, you can't go in! He's in a meeting!

01:34:26.545 --> 01:34:30.095
Alex has come up with
an ingenious way for us to...

01:34:31.635 --> 01:34:34.345
I didn't know we had a meeting today, sport.

01:34:34.475 --> 01:34:37.605
I didn't, either.
I think we should talk, Gordon.

01:34:38.855 --> 01:34:43.855
- Would you excuse us for a second?
- Won't you come this way, gentlemen?

01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:46.025
Thank you, Alex.

01:34:48.235 --> 01:34:49.695
What do you want?

01:34:49.785 --> 01:34:52.905
I just found out about
the garage sale at Bluestar.

01:34:53.035 --> 01:34:56.875
Why?!

01:34:56.995 --> 01:35:00.755
Last night I was reading Rudy
Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Pot.

01:35:00.755 --> 01:35:06.585
You know what happened? He stuck his nose
in the pot once too often, and he got stuck.

01:35:07.295 --> 01:35:09.715
Maybe you oughta read him Pinocchio.

01:35:09.805 --> 01:35:14.305
I thought you were gonna turn
Bluestar around, not upside down!

01:35:14.305 --> 01:35:18.555
- You fuckin' used me!
- You're walking around blind without a cane.

01:35:18.685 --> 01:35:21.475
A fool and his money are lucky to even meet.

01:35:21.605 --> 01:35:26.405
- Why do you need to wreck this company?
- Because it's wreckable, all right?!

01:35:26.485 --> 01:35:29.405
I took another look. I changed my mind.

01:35:29.525 --> 01:35:32.445
If they lose their jobs,
they got nowhere to go!

01:35:32.535 --> 01:35:36.205
My father has worked there for 24 years!
I gave him my word!

01:35:36.285 --> 01:35:38.785
It's all about bucks, kid.

01:35:39.335 --> 01:35:41.835
The rest is conversation.

01:35:41.915 --> 01:35:44.215
Buddy, you'll still be president.

01:35:44.335 --> 01:35:47.675
When the time comes,
you'll parachute out a rich man.

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:51.715
With the money you'll make,
your dad's never got to work again.

01:35:52.555 --> 01:35:56.015
So tell me, Gordon,
when does it all end, huh?

01:35:56.015 --> 01:35:59.435
How many yachts can you water-ski behind?
How much is enough?

01:35:59.555 --> 01:36:03.105
It's not a question of enough, pal.
It's a zero-sum game.

01:36:03.185 --> 01:36:06.025
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

01:36:06.105 --> 01:36:10.065
Money itself isn't lost or made,
it's simply transferred...

01:36:10.195 --> 01:36:13.745
...from one perception to another, like magic.

01:36:14.655 --> 01:36:18.615
This painting here.
I bought it ten years ago for $60,000.

01:36:18.745 --> 01:36:23.205
I could sell it today for six hundred.
The illusion has become real.

01:36:23.335 --> 01:36:27.505
And the more real it becomes,
the more desperate they want it.

01:36:28.545 --> 01:36:31.045
Capitalism at its finest.

01:36:31.545 --> 01:36:34.055
How much is enough, Gordon?

01:36:36.555 --> 01:36:42.935
The richest 1% of this country owns half
our country's wealth. Five trillion dollars.

01:36:43.015 --> 01:36:47.105
One third comes from hard work,
two thirds from inheritance...

01:36:47.105 --> 01:36:50.865
...interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons...

01:36:50.865 --> 01:36:54.405
...and what I do:
stock and real-estate speculation.

01:36:55.115 --> 01:36:56.785
It's bullshit.

01:36:56.905 --> 01:37:01.165
You got 90% of the American public
with little or no net worth.

01:37:01.285 --> 01:37:03.375
I create nothing.

01:37:04.295 --> 01:37:06.375
I own.

01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:09.005
We make the rules, pal.

01:37:09.085 --> 01:37:13.885
The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval,
the price of a paperclip.

01:37:14.005 --> 01:37:19.015
We pick that rabbit out of the hat while
everybody wonders how the hell we did it.

01:37:20.055 --> 01:37:24.855
You're not naive enough to think we're
living in a democracy, are you, Buddy?

01:37:24.935 --> 01:37:28.815
It's the free market, and you're part of it.

01:37:29.945 --> 01:37:32.865
Yeah. You got that killer instinct.

01:37:34.945 --> 01:37:37.865
Stick around, pal.
I still got a lot to teach you.

01:37:37.995 --> 01:37:39.865
Obviously.

01:37:39.865 --> 01:37:42.995
Oh, Buddy, come on.
I was gonna tell you about it.

01:37:43.075 --> 01:37:46.625
Calm down, all right?
We'll have dinner tonight. Bring Darien.

01:37:46.745 --> 01:37:48.505
No, I can't make it tonight.

01:37:48.625 --> 01:37:50.925
Hey, Buddy.

01:37:50.925 --> 01:37:53.425
Are you with me?

01:37:54.135 --> 01:37:57.055
I need to know if you're with me.

01:37:58.425 --> 01:38:00.725
I'm with you, Gordon.

01:38:04.685 --> 01:38:07.815
- Natalie, I'll be right there.
- Yes, Mr Gekko.

01:38:15.735 --> 01:38:18.235
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Ollie.

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:21.785
Tell them I want ziplocked mouths
on the Bluestar deal...

01:38:21.865 --> 01:38:25.535
...or I'll come down there
and rip out their fuckin' throats.

01:39:08.285 --> 01:39:10.165
Bud?

01:39:12.335 --> 01:39:14.425
What's going on?

01:39:19.345 --> 01:39:24.135
I've been played like a grand piano
by the master, Gekko the Great.

01:39:25.475 --> 01:39:27.975
Today was the big crash...

01:39:28.605 --> 01:39:31.225
...the liquidation sale.

01:39:31.225 --> 01:39:36.105
He's gonna carve Bluestar
into little pieces and sell it all off.

01:39:36.235 --> 01:39:38.405
Bastard!

01:39:38.525 --> 01:39:40.615
I'm sorry.

01:39:41.035 --> 01:39:44.035
I was afraid something
like this could happen.

01:39:44.155 --> 01:39:47.705
I handed it to him on a silver platter.
I told my father...

01:39:47.785 --> 01:39:51.045
Bud! Bud, it's not your fault.

01:39:51.125 --> 01:39:53.545
And it's not your decision.

01:39:53.545 --> 01:39:56.545
I'm not gonna let it happen.

01:39:56.675 --> 01:39:59.595
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.

01:40:00.845 --> 01:40:06.475
If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar, someone else
will. Who's to say they won't do the same?

01:40:07.095 --> 01:40:10.105
At least I won't be pulling the trigger.

01:40:11.685 --> 01:40:17.195
Why are you doing this?
You've worked hard to get where you are.

01:40:17.315 --> 01:40:20.945
We're so close.
You don't wanna throw it all away.

01:40:21.695 --> 01:40:25.035
Look, I can stay with the firm,
and you're doing fine.

01:40:25.035 --> 01:40:27.955
We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:38.795
I'm not looking to just survive.

01:40:38.885 --> 01:40:41.795
I've been doing that all my life.

01:40:41.925 --> 01:40:44.845
Cut this self-pity crap, Bud!

01:40:44.925 --> 01:40:47.845
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

01:40:49.095 --> 01:40:54.935
It means if you make an enemy of Gordon
Gekko, I can't be there to stand by you.

01:40:56.315 --> 01:40:59.315
Oh, yeah? Do you really mean that?

01:41:00.485 --> 01:41:03.695
What did he promise you?
To take you public?

01:41:05.075 --> 01:41:10.705
Without his money and seal of approval
I'm not such a hot investment any more.

01:41:10.785 --> 01:41:15.505
- You're just the best money can buy, Darien.
- You're not exactly pure, Bud.

01:41:16.005 --> 01:41:20.085
You went after Gekko and me with
the same vengeance. Look in the mirror.

01:41:20.175 --> 01:41:23.505
I'm looking, and I sure don't like what I see.

01:41:25.515 --> 01:41:29.475
Fair enough. But it's not that simple, Bud.

01:41:30.805 --> 01:41:34.475
When I was down and had nothing,
it was Gordon who helped me.

01:41:34.475 --> 01:41:40.525
He got me all my clients-you among them -
and he can take them away from me like that.

01:41:41.565 --> 01:41:44.905
You may find out that when
you've had money and lost it...

01:41:44.985 --> 01:41:48.445
...it's worse than never having had it at all.
- Oh, yeah?

01:41:48.535 --> 01:41:50.615
That is bullshit!

01:41:52.915 --> 01:41:54.995
Hey! Hey!

01:41:55.545 --> 01:41:59.085
You step out that door
and I am changing the locks!

01:42:02.505 --> 01:42:07.305
You may not believe this, Bud,
but I really do care for you.

01:42:08.345 --> 01:42:11.265
We would've made a good team.

01:42:11.385 --> 01:42:13.685
I'm sorry.

01:42:14.185 --> 01:42:16.605
Get the fuck outta here!

01:42:31.405 --> 01:42:35.375
The market is dead right now.
Even the rich are bitching.

01:42:35.455 --> 01:42:39.755
The only thing moving is the termites
and cockroaches, and my commission...

01:42:39.835 --> 01:42:43.925
Look, save the rap, all right?
Just sell the fucker, fast!

01:42:51.845 --> 01:42:54.345
There he is.
Where you been the last two days?

01:42:54.345 --> 01:42:59.565
- Janet, get my father on the phone and...
- Your mom's been calling. Your father's...

01:42:59.645 --> 01:43:02.775
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack, but he's OK.

01:43:02.895 --> 01:43:05.905
- He's at St John's.
- Oh, Christ!

01:43:12.285 --> 01:43:14.365
Mom? How is he?

01:43:15.075 --> 01:43:17.705
He was complaining
about chest pains at work.

01:43:17.785 --> 01:43:21.545
The next thing I know he's collapsed.
You gotta talk to him.

01:43:21.665 --> 01:43:25.295
Don't worry, he's a tough old nut.
He's got another 20 years.

01:43:25.425 --> 01:43:28.345
- He's gonna be fine, Buddy.
- Is he conscious?

01:43:45.525 --> 01:43:47.615
Hiya, Dad.

01:43:48.365 --> 01:43:51.575
You're looking younger every day.

01:43:52.745 --> 01:43:56.075
Didn't I tell you never
to lift a 747 by yourself?

01:44:00.035 --> 01:44:02.125
You even got me smoking now.

01:44:05.755 --> 01:44:08.585
It's your second heart attack, Dad.

01:44:09.635 --> 01:44:12.555
You're pushing your luck.
I hope you know that.

01:44:14.015 --> 01:44:16.305
I guess I never told you...

01:44:16.805 --> 01:44:19.105
...but I love you, Dad.

01:44:22.775 --> 01:44:25.065
I love you so much!

01:44:27.655 --> 01:44:30.775
I'm sorry... about the things I said.

01:44:33.695 --> 01:44:36.535
You're the only honest man I know.

01:44:36.615 --> 01:44:38.705
The best.

01:44:40.495 --> 01:44:42.875
I got a plan, Dad. I can save the airline.

01:44:42.995 --> 01:44:47.675
I know you got no reason to believe me,
but you have to trust me, OK?

01:44:48.505 --> 01:44:51.135
I need to speak to the union members.

01:44:52.595 --> 01:44:54.465
Can I speak for you?

01:44:56.135 --> 01:44:58.635
Your words, not mine.

01:45:01.555 --> 01:45:03.645
OK.

01:45:11.985 --> 01:45:14.075
I gotta go.

01:45:14.785 --> 01:45:17.285
I'm proud of you.

01:45:26.455 --> 01:45:28.965
The stock's at 19 1/4, and it's going up.

01:45:29.085 --> 01:45:32.635
Gekko figures, by breaking up Bluestar,
it's 30 bucks a share.

01:45:32.635 --> 01:45:36.175
He'll buy up to 24 and still
think he's making money.

01:45:36.175 --> 01:45:38.265
How do you know it'll go up?

01:45:38.975 --> 01:45:43.145
You don't wanna know, Duncan.
Let's just say I have some friends.

01:45:43.265 --> 01:45:46.275
OK. What happens now?

01:45:46.395 --> 01:45:49.315
When it hits 23, you go
to Gekko and lower the boom.

01:45:49.315 --> 01:45:53.065
When he learns he has no union
concessions, he'll jump ship.

01:45:53.155 --> 01:45:58.285
Yeah, but who'll buy then, and what's
to prevent some other shark devouring us?

01:46:01.415 --> 01:46:03.915
We have an appointment to see Mr Wildman.

01:46:04.625 --> 01:46:07.665
Sir Lawrence, or can I call you Larry?

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:12.885
What would you say to owning Bluestar
Airlines, with union concessions...

01:46:12.885 --> 01:46:14.755
...at $18 a share...

01:46:14.845 --> 01:46:19.425
...and, in the process, hanging
Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist?

01:46:19.555 --> 01:46:22.685
I might be very interested. Why you, mate?

01:46:23.185 --> 01:46:27.275
What's a bloke like you
doing mixed up with Gekko?

01:46:27.355 --> 01:46:32.565
Let's just say that me and Mr Gekko
have a serious conflict of interest.

01:46:33.405 --> 01:46:36.235
But we all wanna see this airline work.

01:46:36.325 --> 01:46:38.945
These figures show that it can.

01:46:40.495 --> 01:46:43.955
You're prepared to take
these large salary cuts?

01:46:44.035 --> 01:46:48.415
We are, but we want a contract
agreement that's ironclad.

01:46:48.545 --> 01:46:51.665
So if you buy it, you can't break it up.

01:46:54.465 --> 01:46:56.545
I'm still listening.

01:47:01.345 --> 01:47:02.595
Hi.

01:47:02.725 --> 01:47:06.475
Oh, hi. Say, why don't you
get the hell out of my office?

01:47:06.685 --> 01:47:09.815
I know I've been a schmuck lately.
I want to apologise.

01:47:10.025 --> 01:47:14.485
You've been a real schmuck lately.
So go thou and sin no more.

01:47:14.605 --> 01:47:16.695
I wanna make it up to you.

01:47:18.575 --> 01:47:21.575
Bluestar. Put all your clients in it.

01:47:27.205 --> 01:47:29.415
OK, Buddy-Buddy.

01:47:29.415 --> 01:47:32.625
We are back in business on Bluestar.

01:47:36.715 --> 01:47:41.095
Bluestar, Mr Mannheim.
Put all your clients in it. It's gonna move.

01:47:41.095 --> 01:47:45.555
I don't know where you get
your information, son, but I don't like it.

01:47:46.305 --> 01:47:51.395
The main thing about money, Bud...
it makes you do things you don't wanna do.

01:47:55.565 --> 01:48:01.825
Marty, a favour. 200,000 shares Bluestar at
19 1/2. Can you position it in an equity fund?

01:48:01.945 --> 01:48:04.955
- The Chronicle is on seven.
- Hold, Marty.

01:48:05.575 --> 01:48:10.495
Listen, Blue Horseshoe
loves Bluestar Airlines. Got it?

01:48:10.495 --> 01:48:13.205
- Got it.
- Right. Marty, you still there?

01:48:13.715 --> 01:48:16.625
Bluestar's in play. Let's check it out.

01:48:25.385 --> 01:48:29.055
- 19 1/4, 3/8. 5,000.
- 3/8 at 10,000.

01:48:31.435 --> 01:48:33.855
I do love it so.

01:48:35.315 --> 01:48:38.315
Gordon, I see it at 21 5/8.
I don't know what to make of it.

01:48:38.865 --> 01:48:43.655
The word is out, pal!
Your union buddies are talking.

01:48:43.745 --> 01:48:46.995
You get me in at a 45-degree angle.
All the way in.

01:48:46.995 --> 01:48:51.455
You slash and burn, you buy everything
in sight up to 22, then call me.

01:48:52.705 --> 01:48:58.045
When I get hold of whoever leaked this, I'll
tear his eyes out and suck his fuckin' skull!

01:49:07.015 --> 01:49:09.095
- Stock's going to Pluto.
- Start unloading.

01:49:09.095 --> 01:49:12.015
- What? Sell?
- Dump it! Now! Dump it all!

01:49:12.015 --> 01:49:14.605
- Where's Lou?
- Right over there.

01:49:15.565 --> 01:49:18.145
Ken? Marvin. Jackson Steinem.

01:49:18.275 --> 01:49:21.615
Dump this baby. Take the money and run.
We're getting out.

01:49:22.445 --> 01:49:24.115
It's gotta be a big hitter.

01:49:24.325 --> 01:49:27.655
There's some people from Bluestar
demanding to see you.

01:49:27.745 --> 01:49:30.995
- What the hell do they want?
- I'd be happy to tell you.

01:49:31.075 --> 01:49:36.085
We know what you're up to, Gekko,
and you can go straight to hell!

01:49:36.205 --> 01:49:38.505
No way you're gonna break up our airline.

01:49:38.585 --> 01:49:43.295
- If that's my plan, it's the first I've heard of it.
- Would you put that in writing?

01:49:43.385 --> 01:49:47.265
We have an agreement,
which I expect you to honour.

01:49:47.265 --> 01:49:52.475
- Then you better have a pilot's licence.
- Don't worry, the engines won't fall out.

01:49:52.475 --> 01:49:56.315
But those reservations can get screwed up
if we don't pay attention.

01:49:56.435 --> 01:49:59.775
Baggage for St Petersburg
could wind up in Pittsburgh.

01:49:59.855 --> 01:50:02.775
Look, somebody else
wants to buy your airline.

01:50:02.905 --> 01:50:07.285
You wanna be gobbled up
by Attila the Hun, you be my guest!

01:50:07.365 --> 01:50:09.455
We'll take our chances.

01:50:09.865 --> 01:50:12.375
Nice to see you, Gekko!

01:50:16.245 --> 01:50:20.215
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23.
What do you want him to do?

01:50:22.295 --> 01:50:24.385
Sell it all.

01:50:25.505 --> 01:50:29.675
- What the hell. So we only make 10 million.
- Sell it. Yes, all of it.

01:50:31.475 --> 01:50:33.555
10,000 at 7/8!

01:50:33.555 --> 01:50:35.225
At 7/8, sold!

01:50:36.145 --> 01:50:38.775
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, for chrissake!

01:50:38.855 --> 01:50:40.645
Goddamn connection!

01:50:40.645 --> 01:50:44.695
Bob, we're in big trouble on BST.
You gotta get out now.

01:50:45.315 --> 01:50:46.485
Another 30,000. Out!

01:50:46.485 --> 01:50:50.245
Gekko's selling. There's not many takers.
The stock is plummeting.

01:50:50.655 --> 01:50:54.415
I guess I'll have to carry him
a few rounds before he drops.

01:50:56.085 --> 01:51:02.755
Don't make a big deal of it. Buy it lightly
on the way down. When it hits 18, buy it all.

01:51:03.045 --> 01:51:04.715
Piece of cake, Larry.

01:51:09.635 --> 01:51:11.725
8,000 at 18.

01:51:13.185 --> 01:51:15.265
What is offered at 18?

01:51:16.305 --> 01:51:18.815
300,000... 300,000 at 18!

01:51:19.025 --> 01:51:20.685
18 for 500,000!

01:51:20.685 --> 01:51:22.775
Sold!

01:51:24.855 --> 01:51:26.945
- I'll sell you 50!
- I'll take it!

01:51:34.115 --> 01:51:37.785
- There's gotta be a way outta this.
- Sure. Why don't you dial 911?

01:51:37.875 --> 01:51:39.955
Fox is on four.

01:51:40.085 --> 01:51:46.135
Where the hell are you? I am losing millions.
You sure as hell better get me out of this...

01:51:46.135 --> 01:51:50.305
...or the only job you'll have
on this street is sweeping it!

01:51:51.215 --> 01:51:55.515
You once told me, don't get emotional
about stock, Gordon. Don't.

01:51:55.595 --> 01:52:00.725
The bid is 16 1/2 and going down.
As your broker, I advise you to take it.

01:52:00.935 --> 01:52:05.605
Yeah? Well, you take it! Right in the ass,
you fuckin' scumbag cocksucker!

01:52:06.775 --> 01:52:11.035
It's two minutes to close, Gordon.
What do you wanna do? Decide.

01:52:15.825 --> 01:52:17.915
Dump it.

01:52:23.665 --> 01:52:27.635
The big Wall Street story today
was Bluestar Airlines.

01:52:28.135 --> 01:52:33.135
Fuelled by takeover rumours, the stock
soared to an all-time high of 24 1/8.

01:52:33.265 --> 01:52:37.305
When rumours later surfaced
that the takeover was unfounded...

01:52:37.435 --> 01:52:44.315
...buyers ran for cover and the stock
plummeted to 16 1/2 before closing at 17.

01:52:44.735 --> 01:52:48.905
Then, amidst all the scuttlebutt,
another rumble shook the street.

01:52:48.985 --> 01:52:54.615
Raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
and bought a substantial block of Bluestar...

01:52:54.745 --> 01:52:59.125
...and will announce a deal tomorrow
that includes the support of the unions.

01:52:59.125 --> 01:53:02.455
We talked with a leading
stock market analyst...

01:53:02.545 --> 01:53:05.795
...in order to understand the ramifications...

01:53:05.795 --> 01:53:07.045
Son of a bitch!

01:53:18.185 --> 01:53:21.225
Smile, Carolyn. There's justice in the world.

01:53:35.825 --> 01:53:37.905
Good morning, folks.

01:53:50.635 --> 01:53:52.715
Did somebody die?

01:53:54.175 --> 01:53:56.265
Yeah.

01:54:02.105 --> 01:54:03.975
Morning, Chuckie. Morning, Lou.

01:54:03.975 --> 01:54:05.645
Bud...

01:54:07.735 --> 01:54:09.815
Bud, I like you.

01:54:10.735 --> 01:54:12.815
Just remember something.

01:54:18.655 --> 01:54:21.165
Man looks in the abyss.

01:54:21.285 --> 01:54:23.785
There's nothing staring back at him.

01:54:23.785 --> 01:54:27.125
At that moment, man finds his character.

01:54:27.125 --> 01:54:30.675
And that is what keeps him out of the abyss.

01:54:32.755 --> 01:54:34.845
I think I understand.

01:54:45.895 --> 01:54:48.475
Janet, get my father, will you?

01:54:51.195 --> 01:54:53.905
He just came in. I'll call you back.

01:54:58.695 --> 01:55:01.115
I guess you're not here to open an IRA.

01:55:01.115 --> 01:55:07.045
Henry Patterson, Postal Inspection Service.
Mr Ebenhopper, US Attorney's office.

01:55:07.165 --> 01:55:10.505
Evan Morrissey, Securities and
Exchange Enforcement office.

01:55:10.585 --> 01:55:13.925
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to commit securities fraud...

01:55:14.045 --> 01:55:17.595
...and for violating
the Insider Traders Sanction Act.

01:55:17.595 --> 01:55:21.135
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I knew you were no good.

01:55:21.225 --> 01:55:24.975
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions.

01:55:25.095 --> 01:55:27.605
Anything you do say
may be used against you.

01:55:27.685 --> 01:55:30.315
You have the right to consult an attorney...

01:55:30.315 --> 01:55:34.065
...and to have an attorney present
during any questioning.

01:56:02.515 --> 01:56:04.595
So long, Carolyn.

01:56:17.445 --> 01:56:18.985
Hiya, Buddy.

01:56:19.115 --> 01:56:20.785
Gordon.

01:56:20.865 --> 01:56:23.495
Sandbagged me on Bluestar, huh?

01:56:24.405 --> 01:56:29.835
I guess you think you taught the teacher
a lesson, that the tail can wag the dog, huh?

01:56:33.165 --> 01:56:35.165
Well, let me clue you in, pal.

01:56:35.255 --> 01:56:38.925
The ice is melting right underneath your feet.

01:56:42.135 --> 01:56:46.635
You think you could have gotten this far
this fast with anybody else?

01:56:46.635 --> 01:56:48.725
And dickin' someone like Darien?

01:56:48.725 --> 01:56:54.855
No. You'd be cold-calling widows and
dentists to buy fuckin' dogshit stock!

01:56:54.985 --> 01:56:56.735
I took you in!

01:56:57.065 --> 01:56:58.945
A nobody!

01:56:59.565 --> 01:57:01.445
I opened doors for you.

01:57:01.525 --> 01:57:06.325
I showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

01:57:06.455 --> 01:57:09.455
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources, Geodynamics!

01:57:09.575 --> 01:57:12.295
And this is how you fuckin'
pay me back, you cockroach!

01:57:14.795 --> 01:57:16.875
I gave you Darien!

01:57:17.295 --> 01:57:20.925
I gave you your manhood!
I gave you everything!

01:57:33.145 --> 01:57:35.935
You coulda been one of
the great ones, Buddy.

01:57:37.525 --> 01:57:40.735
I look at you... and I see myself.

01:57:42.735 --> 01:57:44.825
Why?

01:57:46.155 --> 01:57:48.245
I don't know.

01:57:49.915 --> 01:57:52.125
I guess I realised that...

01:57:52.415 --> 01:57:54.705
...I'm just Bud Fox.

01:57:56.705 --> 01:57:59.625
As much as I wanted to be Gordon Gekko...

01:58:00.255 --> 01:58:02.635
...I'll always be Bud Fox.

01:58:48.925 --> 01:58:53.015
I showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

01:58:53.095 --> 01:58:55.185
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources...

01:58:58.645 --> 01:59:01.145
You did the right thing, Bud.

01:59:08.655 --> 01:59:10.955
You told the truth
and gave the money back.

01:59:11.035 --> 01:59:14.995
All things considered in this
cockamamie world, you're shooting par.

01:59:15.125 --> 01:59:18.665
You helped save the airline,
and they'll remember you for it.

01:59:18.665 --> 01:59:23.045
That's right. Think about the job
at Bluestar that Wildman offered you.

01:59:23.125 --> 01:59:25.545
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.

01:59:25.845 --> 01:59:29.385
Yeah, well... maybe that's the price, son.

01:59:29.515 --> 01:59:31.595
It's gonna be hard on you...

01:59:31.675 --> 01:59:36.685
...but maybe in a kind of screwed-up way it's
the best thing that coulda happened to you.

01:59:36.805 --> 01:59:40.565
Stop going for the easy buck
and produce something with your life.

01:59:40.645 --> 01:59:44.735
Create, instead of living off
the buying and selling of others.

01:59:50.235 --> 01:59:52.655
We'll park the car and catch up with you.

01:59:52.745 --> 01:59:54.415
All right.
