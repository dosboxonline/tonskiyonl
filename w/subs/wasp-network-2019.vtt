01:46.583 --> 01:49.458
Irma will sleep at my mom's
so we can go to the movies.

01:49.541 --> 01:52.458
-Oh, okay.
-Don't be late.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.458
Don't worry, I'll be there at six.

01:57.875 --> 01:58.958
Okay.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.166
-Not hungry?
-I'm running late.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.375
Give Daddy a hug.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.750
Her braid.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.333
-Big kiss for Mommy.
-Here, Mommy.

02:10.916 --> 02:12.708
-Love you.
-Me too.

02:12.791 --> 02:15.583
Have a good day.
Wish Daddy a good day.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.208
-Ready?
-Ready.

03:01.583 --> 03:02.750
Go.

03:18.375 --> 03:19.541
Coming to lunch?

03:19.958 --> 03:21.291
Meet you there.

04:39.416 --> 04:41.791
Are you Olga Salanueva,
René González's wife?

04:43.166 --> 04:45.125
Did something happen?

04:45.208 --> 04:47.000
We're from the Ministry of the Interior.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.916
He had an accident?
Is he alive?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.916
He's alive, not hurt.

04:55.208 --> 04:58.250
Comrade Salanueva,
your husband is in Florida.

04:59.416 --> 05:00.500
He defected.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.125
He stole a plane,

05:02.208 --> 05:06.250
flew under our radar,
landed at a U.S. airbase in Miami.

05:58.750 --> 06:02.166
If you receive
the slightest information,

06:02.250 --> 06:05.500
it is your duty
to inform us immediately.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.541
You can count on it.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.041
<i> Hello.</i>

06:24.125 --> 06:25.250
Roberto,

06:25.875 --> 06:27.666
you heard about your brother?

06:27.750 --> 06:28.916
<i>Listen--</i>

06:29.291 --> 06:32.083
I need your help
getting through this.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.666
I'll come over later.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.166
I'll tell our parents first.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.083
Okay.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.583
<i>Then we'll tell Irma.</i>

06:39.916 --> 06:43.333
<i>It'll be hard for her to understand</i>
<i>why he abandoned her.</i>

06:43.416 --> 06:46.375
<i>But I'll be there with you. Okay?</i>

06:46.791 --> 06:48.375
<i>I'll help you.</i>

06:57.250 --> 06:58.875
<i>René, your new home.</i>

06:59.833 --> 07:01.750
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

07:04.375 --> 07:08.666
Rent is paid. Three months
should give you time to get settled.

07:09.791 --> 07:14.166
It's basic, but don't worry.
We'll help you get more stuff.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.958
Who should I thank?

07:18.041 --> 07:19.250
The CANF.

07:19.916 --> 07:22.541
Cuban American National Foundation.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.125
Jorge Mas Canosa.

07:25.208 --> 07:26.791
Our president.

07:27.958 --> 07:29.791
He will rebuild Cuba.

07:30.375 --> 07:34.583
Anything you need
for your work, your family,

07:35.375 --> 07:36.208
ask him.

07:36.291 --> 07:38.583
You start tomorrow,
Opa-locka airport.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.041
As a flight instructor.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.375
Pay's not great,
but you can earn extra on the side.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.416
May I sit with you?
Let me introduce myself.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.958
No need.

08:37.791 --> 08:39.166
You're José Basulto.

08:39.916 --> 08:41.208
At your service.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.166
"Arch-enemy of the Cuban Revolution."

08:44.250 --> 08:47.708
For me, that's a badge of honor.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.041
You fought in Angola.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.583
Tank commander.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.458
Two years in the jungle.
54 missions.

08:56.416 --> 08:58.625
Good reasons for us to get along.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.083
Why?

09:00.208 --> 09:02.666
We need men like you.

09:03.708 --> 09:05.041
I'm not a politician.

09:07.541 --> 09:10.000
Ever hear
of Gregorio Pérez Ricardo?

09:10.500 --> 09:14.458
The kid was 15
when he fled Cuba on a raft.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.333
But he wasn't as lucky as you.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.666
The U.S. Coast Guard found him

09:20.750 --> 09:24.291
so dehydrated,
they couldn't revive him.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.916
So we set up an organization

09:28.000 --> 09:30.541
called "Brothers to the Rescue",

09:31.333 --> 09:33.833
to help our brothers.

09:33.916 --> 09:36.791
So nothing like that ever happens again.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.875
How do you plan to do that?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.625
Eriberto, a coffee.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.083
Want one?

09:44.166 --> 09:45.208
Sure.

09:45.291 --> 09:46.333
Two.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.541
You know that

09:50.625 --> 09:52.625
I used to be a violent man.

09:53.291 --> 09:56.416
Trained by the U.S. as a terrorist.

09:56.791 --> 09:58.791
My hero was John Wayne.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.291
But not anymore.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.416
Now I'm a kind of...

10:05.333 --> 10:06.416
Jedi.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.041
Like Luke Skywalker.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.750
The Force is with us.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.375
Understand?

10:13.833 --> 10:14.791
Sort of.

10:15.208 --> 10:18.833
It's all about solidarity, humanism.

10:18.916 --> 10:23.375
We'll go find rafters in the sea

10:23.458 --> 10:25.833
and guide them to freedom.

10:27.541 --> 10:28.375
Thank you.

10:31.666 --> 10:33.000
By monitoring the ocean.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.416
We have the planes

10:35.500 --> 10:38.750
but we don't have
enough pilots like you.

10:41.541 --> 10:45.291
It's $25 a run,
plus 25 per flight hour.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.750
Who pays?

10:46.833 --> 10:50.833
Jorge Mas Canosa.
Money is not a problem for him.

10:52.625 --> 10:57.708
The collapse of the Soviet Union
has raised people's hopes.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.083
And yet...

10:59.791 --> 11:01.041
Castro is holding on.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.708
Without Russian money,
he won't last long.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.208
When the regime collapses,

11:06.291 --> 11:11.000
they'll have to return the refineries,
banks, factories. And casinos!

11:12.416 --> 11:16.916
The stakes are enormous for every exile.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.250
Take yourself.

11:18.708 --> 11:20.625
You left your family there.

11:20.708 --> 11:24.291
You're a brave man. You fled communism.

11:24.833 --> 11:27.750
You started over here in Miami.

11:29.583 --> 11:30.416
But...

11:33.375 --> 11:35.083
you have a choice to make.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.875
Keep on gardening...

11:39.708 --> 11:43.416
or help bring democracy
to our country.

12:32.583 --> 12:33.958
You saved them.

12:34.791 --> 12:36.625
Coast Guard on the way!

12:36.708 --> 12:38.541
-Those poor people.
-Good job.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.958
I hope they make it.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.041
Sure they will. Look...

12:42.416 --> 12:45.458
Hey, a gift from Willy Chirino.

12:45.541 --> 12:46.875
Really?

12:47.458 --> 12:49.000
And that one...

12:49.083 --> 12:50.583
Gloria Estefan.

12:50.666 --> 12:53.291
Damn!
Ask her to come christen it.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.500
Good idea
but don't get your hopes up.

13:01.708 --> 13:05.500
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>We're crossing Parallel 24.</i>

13:05.583 --> 13:07.833
<i>Entering Cuban airspace.</i>

13:08.166 --> 13:09.416
<i>Listen.</i>

13:09.500 --> 13:12.458
<i>We're not just</i>
<i>a humanitarian organization.</i>

13:12.541 --> 13:15.625
<i>We're a militant organization.</i>

13:53.666 --> 13:55.208
<i>They're showing off.</i>

13:55.291 --> 13:56.958
<i>Showing off, my ass.</i>

14:08.750 --> 14:10.208
<i>Take over.</i>

14:10.625 --> 14:12.708
<i>Follow the </i>Malecon.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.375
<i>Turn right.</i>

14:52.333 --> 14:53.625
<i>Dear Olga,</i>

14:55.250 --> 14:57.791
<i>You haven't answered my letters.</i>

14:58.583 --> 15:00.041
<i>I understand your reasons.</i>

15:01.000 --> 15:02.791
<i>But understand mine.</i>

15:04.500 --> 15:05.666
<i>I'm a pilot.</i>

15:06.375 --> 15:09.166
<i>I don't want to be</i>
<i>a flight instructor all my life.</i>

15:09.541 --> 15:11.166
<i>It's always tough at first</i>

15:12.375 --> 15:15.000
<i>but this is a land of opportunities.</i>

15:15.500 --> 15:17.416
<i>There are plenty for all of us.</i>

15:19.041 --> 15:21.416
<i>I'm checking out schools for Irma.</i>

15:24.041 --> 15:25.416
<i>Dear René,</i>

15:26.416 --> 15:28.583
<i>I've received your many letters.</i>

15:29.041 --> 15:32.375
<i>I'm so saddened by this,</i>
<i>I can't open them.</i>

15:33.833 --> 15:35.833
<i>Here, life is very difficult.</i>

15:35.916 --> 15:39.875
<i>Blackouts last eight hours,</i>
<i>and it's difficult to find food.</i>

15:40.416 --> 15:43.291
<i>It's harder and harder</i>
<i>to get by on my own.</i>

15:44.041 --> 15:45.916
<i>Irma is a big girl now.</i>

15:46.000 --> 15:49.208
<i>She's asking questions.</i>
<i>I hate lying to her.</i>

15:50.041 --> 15:52.666
<i>I don't want her to learn</i>
<i>her father's a traitor.</i>

15:52.958 --> 15:55.833
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>last week we got robbed.</i>

15:55.916 --> 15:58.458
<i>They took all our valuables.</i>

15:59.541 --> 16:02.250
<i>But I'm a fighter, you know that.</i>

16:02.916 --> 16:05.708
<i>You also know I'm not angry with you.</i>

16:06.250 --> 16:09.375
<i>I wish you luck in your new life.</i>

16:10.375 --> 16:11.916
<i>But I regret to tell you,</i>

16:12.666 --> 16:14.041
<i>it won't be with me.</i>

20:03.041 --> 20:05.250
The couch
is the best I can do.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.166
-Don't worry about it.
-It'll help for a while.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.083
It's perfect, thanks.

20:20.958 --> 20:21.875
Listen...

20:23.250 --> 20:25.750
We have associations
that help defectors.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.625
But let me ask you something.

20:27.791 --> 20:28.958
Why did you come?

20:29.416 --> 20:31.708
To deliver pizzas or to strike it rich?

20:32.333 --> 20:33.625
-What about you?

20:34.250 --> 20:35.250
Me?

20:36.458 --> 20:38.166
I'm a <i>biznero,</i> dude.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.791
You know me.
A little bit of everything.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.333
And that's enough?

20:45.958 --> 20:47.416
What do you think?

20:48.125 --> 20:49.166
So?

20:49.500 --> 20:50.708
Should I tell you?

20:52.083 --> 20:54.250
I'm also an FBI informer.

20:56.125 --> 20:59.125
I update them
on the community's mood.

21:00.416 --> 21:02.375
And the pay is good.

21:03.291 --> 21:04.500
Big money!

21:19.500 --> 21:21.583
Thank you for the mass.
Really good. Thank you.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.458
Cousin, come here.

23:30.416 --> 23:32.458
You're a friend
of Nico Gutiérrez's?

23:32.541 --> 23:34.416
His personal trainer.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.458
Great!

23:35.541 --> 23:37.500
Well, Nico...

23:38.166 --> 23:39.416
suggested I call you.

23:39.500 --> 23:43.375
He's working out.
I've told him to for ages.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.500
Look, Basulto.

23:47.166 --> 23:49.166
Your pilot's log.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.541
I was a major in the Air Force.

23:56.916 --> 23:58.541
I used to fly MiGs.

23:59.541 --> 24:01.541
You're more experienced than me.

24:02.458 --> 24:04.250
Want to fly again?

24:04.333 --> 24:05.625
I left Cuba...

24:06.333 --> 24:08.250
to fight the Castros.

24:09.875 --> 24:14.125
In our organization,
there's an elite group.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.666
We call them the kamikazes.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.500
I'd like to know what it's about.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.500
We don't respect safety rules

24:22.583 --> 24:24.708
or the laws of aeronautics.

24:24.791 --> 24:26.291
Meaning?

24:26.541 --> 24:28.166
If you join us,

24:28.250 --> 24:30.458
you'll be flying 9-hour days,

24:30.541 --> 24:34.250
7 days a week, every month, no breaks.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.166
Full time.

24:37.416 --> 24:39.500
My friend...

24:41.083 --> 24:42.041
That's illegal.

24:42.541 --> 24:44.166
Illegal...

24:44.291 --> 24:45.541
And very dangerous.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.583
You're telling me!

24:47.666 --> 24:49.166
I had a fire aboard.

24:49.708 --> 24:53.625
Made a landing on Cayo Sal,
off Venezuela.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.708
Man, was I in deep shit!

24:56.666 --> 24:59.583
Truth is, Juan Pablo Roque,

24:59.666 --> 25:02.208
we at Brothers to the Rescue

25:03.000 --> 25:05.833
need pilots like you.

25:27.208 --> 25:30.000
Cuban Coast Guard ahead.
Change course.

25:30.541 --> 25:32.708
South-southeast. Varadero.

25:44.666 --> 25:45.500
Hey.

25:47.166 --> 25:49.416
-How did it go?
-Things went wrong.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.208
-Nabbed by the Cubans?
-Mm-mm.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.750
They changed course.
Their engine broke down off Varadero.

25:57.208 --> 26:00.750
U.S. Customs found them.
Seized their weapons.

26:00.833 --> 26:01.791
Shit!

26:02.750 --> 26:04.041
Hope they don't talk.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.125
Mm-hm.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.125
No one must know we guided them.

26:09.541 --> 26:10.958
Your family stayed in Cuba?

26:11.375 --> 26:12.208
Yes.

26:13.958 --> 26:15.958
Life is tough there, as you know.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.958
Their connection to me

26:20.708 --> 26:23.291
doesn't make things easier.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.916
It complicates everything.

26:25.916 --> 26:27.916
For them, I'm a traitor.

26:28.541 --> 26:29.375
A <i>gusano.</i>

26:30.541 --> 26:33.000
Sure your wife still loves you?

26:33.083 --> 26:35.041
I'm still in love with her.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.625
I can't live without that woman.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.583
And I think she misses me.

26:41.666 --> 26:42.958
So does my daughter.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.625
I want to believe that.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.000
What about you?

26:48.416 --> 26:51.791
You're a star here, you're on TV and all.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.166
Dude,

26:55.625 --> 26:57.375
if I were a star,

26:57.458 --> 26:59.708
I wouldn't be on this bus with you.

27:00.208 --> 27:02.583
I'd be in a limousine.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.125
You know what?

27:05.833 --> 27:09.333
A paparazzi offered me 5,000

27:10.541 --> 27:13.708
for pictures of me at the beach
with girls in bikinis.

27:15.916 --> 27:17.041
What did you tell him?

27:17.708 --> 27:18.583
Nothing.

27:20.875 --> 27:21.708
I...

27:23.166 --> 27:25.125
I'm starting my life over,

27:25.791 --> 27:26.916
but not like that.

27:29.083 --> 27:30.083
I get it.

27:33.708 --> 27:35.625
I'm marrying Ana Margarita.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.375
No way.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.916
Good going, brother.

28:19.708 --> 28:20.750
Olga.

28:23.083 --> 28:23.958
Olga.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.541
How did it go?

28:31.583 --> 28:33.458
-Did you eat well?
-Yes.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.500
A fight with her cousin.

28:35.583 --> 28:36.875
I bit him.

28:36.958 --> 28:38.750
Why did you bite him?

28:38.833 --> 28:40.625
I'm not saying.

28:40.708 --> 28:43.416
Go wash and straight to bed.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.041
Look at the time.

28:46.125 --> 28:49.333
Psst, hey!
No goodnight kiss for Uncle?

28:49.416 --> 28:50.250
Come here.

28:53.541 --> 28:54.500
See you tomorrow.

28:54.583 --> 28:56.458
Goodnight, Uncle Roberto.

28:56.541 --> 28:58.083
Goodnight, miss.

29:01.291 --> 29:04.500
There are bags of his clothes
in the bedroom.

29:05.083 --> 29:06.833
I'll give some to our father.

29:07.125 --> 29:09.250
As long as you get rid of them.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.583
I want nothing of René's here.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.708
Now tell me
why you bit your cousin.

29:18.916 --> 29:20.583
We played Memory.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.125
I won all 10 rounds.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.500
I told him I was the champ.

29:24.583 --> 29:27.000
Always bragging.

29:27.083 --> 29:29.666
He said I was the champ,

29:30.041 --> 29:32.208
but my father is a traitor.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.375
You should have explained.

29:35.833 --> 29:38.208
Is it true Daddy's a traitor?

29:39.083 --> 29:40.333
My sweetheart,

29:40.875 --> 29:45.791
I've often told you
why Daddy went abroad.

29:46.541 --> 29:50.625
To do business
to help our country's economy.

29:50.708 --> 29:53.000
Fighting the U.S. embargo.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.083
That's not being a traitor.

29:55.166 --> 29:57.375
That's being a patriot.

29:58.583 --> 30:00.083
-Come here.

30:08.791 --> 30:09.666
Look.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.791
They all say the same thing.

30:12.083 --> 30:16.166
I answered him once
and he should consider himself lucky.

30:16.833 --> 30:18.125
What did you write?

30:18.791 --> 30:20.458
I still love him,

30:20.541 --> 30:23.000
but no way are Irma and I going

30:23.083 --> 30:24.625
to the United States.

30:25.875 --> 30:29.041
My daughter won't be raised by a traitor.

30:29.916 --> 30:33.125
Or live close to a terrorist,
like José Basulto.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.583
I heard René left Basulto
and joined the PUND.

30:37.291 --> 30:38.750
Better pay, supposedly.

30:39.541 --> 30:43.958
With them, you never know
where the fight for a free Cuba ends

30:44.041 --> 30:45.875
and drug smuggling begins.

30:47.041 --> 30:50.000
Know where René will end up?
In jail!

30:50.333 --> 30:53.083
And I won't care a bit.

31:26.625 --> 31:27.833
Hurry up!

31:28.958 --> 31:31.666
Faster!

32:14.166 --> 32:15.250
You saw nothing.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.125
<i>Coño.</i>

32:33.958 --> 32:34.958
René...

32:35.416 --> 32:37.166
-Hello, darling.
-Hello!

32:37.250 --> 32:38.791
-How are you?
-Good.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.708
-Hope you're hungry.
-Pretty hungry.

32:44.125 --> 32:45.416
-Gracias.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.208
Speak Russian?

32:49.791 --> 32:52.041
I learned it in Cuba.
Like you.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.083
Good.

32:54.916 --> 32:56.375
It's about the PUND.

32:56.875 --> 33:00.291
You know the rumor.
They're just a front.

33:00.375 --> 33:02.291
Working with the Colombians.

33:02.375 --> 33:04.583
Smuggling cocaine.

33:04.666 --> 33:07.958
You said you didn't believe it.

33:08.041 --> 33:09.208
First, I didn't.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.416
Tequila.

33:13.416 --> 33:15.000
Mariquitas de platanos!

33:15.083 --> 33:17.333
-Like them?
-Love them.

33:17.958 --> 33:19.333
She's some cook!

33:19.416 --> 33:20.250
I bet.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.458
Cheers!

33:21.541 --> 33:22.500
Hermano.

33:22.583 --> 33:23.416
Salud.

33:34.041 --> 33:36.916
I flew one of their loads myself.

33:37.041 --> 33:41.458
I don't want to get arrested
for drug smuggling.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.458
Roque--

33:42.541 --> 33:46.833
I didn't come to the States
to end up in jail.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.208
I told you.

33:49.833 --> 33:52.833
My cousin Denayf works for the FBI.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.208
He can put you in touch with his boss.

34:01.541 --> 34:02.625
How are you?

34:03.583 --> 34:04.875
René Gonzales.

34:05.375 --> 34:06.666
Nice to meet you.

34:11.125 --> 34:14.250
What I need is an airtight case.

34:16.541 --> 34:17.541
So René...

34:19.166 --> 34:20.791
How far will you go for us?

34:21.250 --> 34:23.541
I won't take part
in their criminal activities.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.833
I'll cut to the chase.

34:25.916 --> 34:29.041
I'm offering you to be an FBI informer.

34:30.541 --> 34:33.500
You'll get $1,500 a week.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.541
All I ask of you

34:36.541 --> 34:40.166
is to brief me on the PUND's activities.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.458
Informer.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.625
Not my thing.

34:47.875 --> 34:49.791
Your friend Juan Pablo Roque

34:49.875 --> 34:53.750
has been working for us for a year.

34:54.916 --> 34:56.666
For the same money.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.250
Now I get it.

34:58.333 --> 34:59.458
Get what?

34:59.541 --> 35:00.750
His lifestyle.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.708
Don't be a cocksucker.

36:19.958 --> 36:22.583
Tell me you're sure.
You made up your mind.

36:22.666 --> 36:24.000
I'm no rat.

36:25.166 --> 36:29.750
Who says working for the FBI
is being a rat?

36:29.833 --> 36:32.000
At least it pays well.

36:32.333 --> 36:36.333
I didn't sacrifice my life in Cuba
to make money here.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.625
Life there is a disaster.

36:38.708 --> 36:40.000
No gas.

36:40.625 --> 36:43.416
Eight hours of electricity a day.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.708
No medicine.

36:44.791 --> 36:47.166
No food. People are starving.

36:47.250 --> 36:48.833
Let me ask you a question.

36:49.416 --> 36:52.125
Know how much
<i>Movimiento Democracia</i> charges

36:52.208 --> 36:54.250
to bring people from Cuba to Florida?

36:54.333 --> 36:55.625
A lot.

36:56.666 --> 36:58.416
But it's for a good cause.

37:03.916 --> 37:04.875
My job...

37:05.833 --> 37:06.916
is to save lives.

41:04.041 --> 41:06.166
<i>This is Charlie 4-0-4-7.</i>

41:06.541 --> 41:09.666
<i>This is Charlie 4-0-4-7.</i>
<i>Blue Shark, do you copy?</i>

41:09.750 --> 41:11.875
This is Blue Shark, copy.

41:11.958 --> 41:14.250
<i>Flying along 24th Parallel, 82W.</i>

41:14.708 --> 41:15.958
<i>The sea is clear.</i>

41:17.083 --> 41:18.708
<i>I repeat: Sea is clear.</i>

41:21.916 --> 41:24.416
No Coast Guard. Let's go!

41:26.875 --> 41:27.750
Chino!

42:08.291 --> 42:09.708
Back from a mission?

42:10.291 --> 42:12.166
Don't you have your own sources?

42:12.250 --> 42:14.500
They say the operation was a success.

42:15.666 --> 42:17.291
No casualties. But damage.

42:17.375 --> 42:19.333
-Bad?
-Bad enough.

42:20.125 --> 42:23.166
The Cubans won't shout it from rooftops,

42:23.250 --> 42:24.625
as you can imagine.

42:25.500 --> 42:28.250
The Movimiento may be proud. Not me.

42:30.291 --> 42:32.833
Why, if it's not indiscreet?

42:32.916 --> 42:36.416
I didn't join the resistance
to abet terrorists.

42:36.958 --> 42:38.625
Just to save rafters.

42:40.208 --> 42:41.125
A beer?

42:49.083 --> 42:50.625
Why did you want to see me?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.541
I got news from Olga.

42:53.208 --> 42:54.125
Damn!

42:54.625 --> 42:56.750
She's finally writing back?

42:57.375 --> 42:58.208
Yes.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.625
Her whole life is in Cuba.

43:02.208 --> 43:03.416
Her career,

43:03.916 --> 43:05.666
her friends, family.

43:06.666 --> 43:09.875
-It must be tough for her.
-Yeah.

43:10.916 --> 43:12.500
But...

43:13.000 --> 43:14.583
she's made a decision.

43:14.958 --> 43:15.791
Really?

43:17.166 --> 43:18.833
She'll come and live with me.

43:20.791 --> 43:22.000
Okay, but...

43:22.583 --> 43:25.333
that's much easier said than done.

43:25.416 --> 43:26.916
I'm a U.S. citizen.

43:27.000 --> 43:27.833
And?

43:28.291 --> 43:30.791
The new law prioritizes U.S. citizens.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.375
It's not so simple.

43:33.041 --> 43:34.333
There are quotas,

43:34.708 --> 43:37.291
waiting lists, bureaucracy.

43:37.375 --> 43:39.166
Which is why I need your help.

43:43.750 --> 43:45.583
You have connections in Washington.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.875
Does she have a Cuban exit visa?

43:48.500 --> 43:49.375
No.

43:49.625 --> 43:54.250
No use pulling strings
if they won't let her leave.

44:30.833 --> 44:34.416
Bless and sanctify, Lord,

44:34.500 --> 44:39.000
the love uniting
Juan Pablo and Ana Margarita.

44:46.041 --> 44:48.083
Juan Pablo,

44:48.541 --> 44:50.416
this ring is a symbol

44:50.500 --> 44:53.250
of my love and my loyalty.

44:54.333 --> 44:57.250
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.333
-May I?
-You may kiss the bride.

46:04.708 --> 46:08.000
Come,
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

46:20.916 --> 46:24.333
Juan Pablo,
It is my honor to introduce you

46:24.416 --> 46:27.958
to the President of the CANF,
Jorge Mas Canosa.

46:28.041 --> 46:32.541
This man will lead us
to a free and democratic Cuba.

46:32.625 --> 46:34.708
An honor to have you here.

46:35.916 --> 46:38.791
A promise of success for our marriage.

46:38.875 --> 46:42.000
My friend, Basulto, says
you're our best pilot.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.000
Available at any hour.

46:44.083 --> 46:46.166
Sir, with all due respect,

46:47.125 --> 46:48.208
from now on,

46:48.583 --> 46:50.708
you'll have to check with my wife
about that.

47:03.333 --> 47:04.458
Congratulations.

47:04.541 --> 47:07.208
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

47:23.166 --> 47:25.708
-He's very handsome.
-Thank you.

47:36.291 --> 47:37.625
Here's the groom.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.166
I'm very happy for you.

48:09.791 --> 48:11.833
If only my wife were here.

48:13.541 --> 48:15.208
She'll come, trust me.

48:19.458 --> 48:21.208
Great crowd.

48:23.416 --> 48:25.916
Jorge Mas Canosa, no less!

48:27.583 --> 48:30.083
He rarely goes out in public.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.208
It's an honor.

48:34.208 --> 48:36.375
He wanted a picture with us.

48:36.458 --> 48:39.333
He even called the press.

50:39.333 --> 50:40.916
Got the missing document?

50:41.375 --> 50:42.791
It arrived this morning.

50:42.875 --> 50:45.875
This morning! I asked for it 3 weeks ago.

50:45.958 --> 50:49.500
Now you can officially quit the tannery.

50:49.916 --> 50:52.416
Are you making the right decision?

50:52.875 --> 50:54.250
Yes, I am.

50:54.333 --> 50:57.583
We need you.
And I know you like your job.

50:58.458 --> 51:01.791
What will you do in Miami?
Start over from scratch?

51:01.875 --> 51:05.208
My daughter needs a father. I told you.

51:05.291 --> 51:07.875
Yes, but that father? A traitor.

51:07.958 --> 51:09.083
Only one she has.

51:09.166 --> 51:10.291
So,

51:10.750 --> 51:12.625
you're sacrificing yourself.

51:13.208 --> 51:16.541
That's one way of looking at it.
Thank you, Luis.

51:30.958 --> 51:33.375
-Yanicé Rodríguez.
-Here.

51:36.083 --> 51:37.791
Caridad de la Nuez.

51:39.666 --> 51:40.750
Not here?

51:41.333 --> 51:43.166
Olga Salanueva.

51:45.416 --> 51:47.000
You go to that desk.

51:48.125 --> 51:49.333
You come here.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.083
-You go there.
-Hello.

51:52.958 --> 51:57.083
Comrade, I brought the document
you requested last time.

51:58.250 --> 51:59.833
And my daughter, as you asked.

52:00.291 --> 52:03.083
Thank you. This will help your case.

52:04.625 --> 52:06.166
But it's not the right one.

52:06.708 --> 52:07.541
What?

52:07.708 --> 52:10.458
I need one
from the Ministry of Light Industry.

52:10.541 --> 52:12.458
-You have it now.
-No.

52:12.541 --> 52:14.875
This is from the Tannery Directorate.

52:15.833 --> 52:18.958
But the Directorate
is part of the Ministry.

52:19.041 --> 52:20.583
Perhaps, but it's different.

52:20.666 --> 52:23.083
-I need--
-No one will ever believe me.

52:23.166 --> 52:24.416
Can I finish?

52:24.708 --> 52:26.416
I'm sorry.

52:27.166 --> 52:30.791
I need a waiver from the Ministry
releasing you from your contract

52:30.875 --> 52:33.375
and stating you have no debts
with the State.

52:33.458 --> 52:34.875
I have no debts at all.

52:35.375 --> 52:37.875
So the document will be easy to get.

52:45.166 --> 52:46.000
Yes?

52:46.083 --> 52:50.041
I couldn't wait to tell you the good news.

52:50.125 --> 52:51.500
I found a job.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.583
For a cargo airline, Arrow Air.

52:55.125 --> 52:57.958
We can get by until you get a job.

52:58.041 --> 53:01.416
And if I pass my engineer exam,
you won't even have to work.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.208
You're not happy?

53:04.791 --> 53:08.375
Listen, René...
I went to the Ministry yesterday.

53:08.583 --> 53:10.583
It didn't go well.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.958
It's your father.

53:14.750 --> 53:17.791
Leave me alone.

53:19.875 --> 53:20.916
Another delay?

53:21.000 --> 53:22.416
<i>Even worse!</i>

53:22.916 --> 53:25.791
I had all the documents

53:25.875 --> 53:28.416
but they invented a new one.

53:29.333 --> 53:30.416
I'm so discouraged.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.875
Please. Not now.

53:32.958 --> 53:35.166
We're getting so close.

53:35.333 --> 53:37.000
You know the real problem.

53:37.083 --> 53:39.250
The problem is you.

53:39.333 --> 53:43.083
Not the documents. It's you.

53:43.500 --> 53:46.458
<i>They'll never let me leave this country.</i>

55:29.708 --> 55:30.625
What's your name?

55:31.000 --> 55:32.541
Manuel Viramontez.

55:32.625 --> 55:33.750
Your parents?

55:33.833 --> 55:35.833
Pedro Viramontez and Rosalina Carrea.

55:36.125 --> 55:37.500
Place and date of birth?

55:37.958 --> 55:41.916
Cameron County, Texas.
January 26, 1967.

55:42.250 --> 55:45.791
My parents returned to Puerto Rico in '70.
Where they're from.

55:45.875 --> 55:48.166
I'm an American citizen.

55:48.916 --> 55:50.708
Your social security number?

55:55.041 --> 55:56.750
Your address in Puerto Rico?

55:57.166 --> 55:59.958
Darlington Building on Boriqueña Avenue,

56:00.041 --> 56:03.708
00925, Apartment 6C, Rio Piedras.

56:04.333 --> 56:05.875
Phone number?

56:06.083 --> 56:08.166
658-1117.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.000
The building?

56:10.333 --> 56:13.291
A white building, eleven floors.

56:13.375 --> 56:15.541
On the first floor
there's a salsa station,

56:15.625 --> 56:16.833
Radio Voz...

56:16.916 --> 56:21.500
Very good, Lieutenant Hernandez.
How long have you been with us?

56:21.583 --> 56:24.541
Six months... studying my role.

56:24.625 --> 56:25.583
Like an actor.

56:25.666 --> 56:28.416
Better than many actors.

56:30.166 --> 56:31.791
I see here

56:32.291 --> 56:35.416
that you joined a video rental club.

56:35.500 --> 56:38.833
Two glass doors.
You had to knock to get in.

56:38.916 --> 56:40.708
$3 a film.

56:41.416 --> 56:43.916
Well, thank you. You're dismissed.

56:44.000 --> 56:44.875
Sir...

56:47.958 --> 56:48.791
So?

56:49.250 --> 56:52.458
His Puerto Rican accent is perfect.

56:54.750 --> 56:57.916
I think he's ready to move to Miami.

56:58.291 --> 56:59.583
To run the Wasp Network.

57:06.250 --> 57:08.416
-If you please.
-Thank you.

57:09.250 --> 57:10.083
Thank you.

57:12.208 --> 57:13.083
Let's toast.

57:13.166 --> 57:14.416
To what?

57:15.000 --> 57:16.416
First, we toast.

57:20.250 --> 57:21.333
Listen Adriana,

57:22.583 --> 57:25.916
my International Relations thesis
was approved.

57:26.708 --> 57:28.666
So no more money problems?

57:29.083 --> 57:30.625
No more money problems.

57:31.625 --> 57:33.083
University pays for travel.

57:34.333 --> 57:35.458
Your travel?

57:35.541 --> 57:36.625
I'm going away.

57:37.625 --> 57:38.875
For several months.

57:39.416 --> 57:40.333
But...

57:45.625 --> 57:47.250
we said we'd have a child.

57:47.666 --> 57:48.833
We will.

57:50.666 --> 57:52.250
When I come back.

57:52.541 --> 57:53.833
When you come back.

57:55.166 --> 57:56.000
Of course.

58:21.916 --> 58:23.625
I don't want to hurt you.

58:23.958 --> 58:25.958
-I'd hoped--
-For what?

58:26.833 --> 58:28.708
You'd finish your studies here,

58:29.500 --> 58:32.041
become a diplomat,
as you always said.

58:32.125 --> 58:33.583
I will do that.

58:33.666 --> 58:34.500
No.

58:34.708 --> 58:35.625
You're going away.

58:46.416 --> 58:47.333
Adriana,

58:49.291 --> 58:51.958
what I'm telling you
mustn't leave this room.

58:52.375 --> 58:56.083
For our love's sake,
it must never leave this room.

58:57.666 --> 58:59.000
You have my word.

58:59.541 --> 59:02.875
Anti-Castroist groups in Miami

59:02.958 --> 59:05.166
want to choke Cuba's economy.

59:05.916 --> 59:10.125
It's why they're attacking
our tourism industry.

59:11.125 --> 59:14.583
They want the world to think
Cuba is dangerous.

59:16.208 --> 59:20.041
The only way to stop them is to infiltrate

59:21.208 --> 59:23.833
their organizations in Florida.

59:25.041 --> 59:26.750
And find out what they're planning.

59:27.875 --> 59:29.833
We already have
men on the ground.

59:30.458 --> 59:32.666
They're waiting to be coordinated.

59:41.000 --> 59:41.833
They asked me

59:43.791 --> 59:45.625
to run this network.

59:47.041 --> 59:48.250
And I said yes.

59:50.833 --> 59:52.250
The Wasp Network.

1:02:43.583 --> 1:02:45.625
-What's this?
-C4!

1:03:47.958 --> 1:03:49.583
-Welcome.
-Hello.

1:03:49.916 --> 1:03:51.166
Have a seat.

1:03:54.125 --> 1:03:55.000
Thank you.

1:04:05.333 --> 1:04:06.208
So...

1:04:06.708 --> 1:04:09.208
you're joining your husband in Miami.

1:04:09.791 --> 1:04:12.750
Yes, but I'm doing it for my daughter.

1:04:12.916 --> 1:04:14.958
So she's near her father.

1:04:15.458 --> 1:04:17.916
It's important that you know the truth.

1:04:20.250 --> 1:04:22.541
Your husband, René González,

1:04:23.708 --> 1:04:24.833
is not a traitor.

1:04:27.458 --> 1:04:29.458
Your husband is a hero.

1:04:29.958 --> 1:04:31.000
A hero?

1:04:32.666 --> 1:04:35.375
He sacrificed everything
for our Revolution.

1:04:35.458 --> 1:04:38.708
His relationship with you,
with your daughter.

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.083
He is in Miami on a mission.

1:04:44.583 --> 1:04:47.583
To infiltrate terrorist organizations

1:04:47.666 --> 1:04:50.375
and warn us about their plans.

1:04:52.916 --> 1:04:54.583
He's helped save many lives.

1:04:56.666 --> 1:04:59.208
Now that you're joining him,
you must know.

1:05:00.541 --> 1:05:02.541
But most important...

1:05:02.625 --> 1:05:06.625
your daughter
must never find out.

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:07.875
Never.

1:05:09.291 --> 1:05:10.375
Understand?

1:05:13.958 --> 1:05:15.166
Do I have your word?

1:05:16.458 --> 1:05:17.416
Yes.

1:05:23.958 --> 1:05:27.250
Truth is,
I made the same choice as your husband.

1:05:27.333 --> 1:05:29.416
I'm in Miami, too.

1:05:29.625 --> 1:05:32.666
I'm in contact with him,
and now with you.

1:05:33.541 --> 1:05:35.000
I came back to tell you.

1:05:37.583 --> 1:05:40.416
It's important that you understand:

1:05:40.666 --> 1:05:41.666
your safety,

1:05:42.208 --> 1:05:43.625
your husband's,

1:05:44.083 --> 1:05:45.541
your daughter's, mine,

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.250
everyone's safety

1:05:48.041 --> 1:05:50.375
depends on you and your silence.

1:05:52.250 --> 1:05:53.625
You can trust me.

1:05:58.666 --> 1:06:02.208
My God!
All these years, I feel like...

1:06:05.125 --> 1:06:06.416
Excuse me.

1:06:09.875 --> 1:06:11.250
All this...

1:06:13.375 --> 1:06:17.583
I need to take it in little by little,
not all at once.

1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:56.750
Damn! Ever the star!

1:09:57.250 --> 1:10:00.666
I'll help you!

1:10:03.458 --> 1:10:05.333
How did you do that?

1:10:06.375 --> 1:10:07.958
I slipped in the shower.

1:10:08.875 --> 1:10:09.958
I'm sorry.

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:11.708
And you can't fly?

1:10:12.458 --> 1:10:14.666
No... not with a brace.

1:10:15.125 --> 1:10:15.958
Hmm.

1:10:18.250 --> 1:10:20.416
We had to reorganize at the last minute.

1:10:28.541 --> 1:10:30.041
Don't miss the plane.

1:10:36.125 --> 1:10:37.875
Your ticket to Havana.

1:12:34.666 --> 1:12:36.875
Give us our course,

1:12:37.625 --> 1:12:38.916
our direction...

1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:43.000
Give us our course, our direction...

1:12:43.083 --> 1:12:45.166
and guide our planes

1:12:45.250 --> 1:12:48.541
to our brothers on the sea.

1:12:48.958 --> 1:12:53.708
and guide our planes
to our brothers on the sea.

1:12:54.625 --> 1:12:55.458
Good luck.

1:12:55.541 --> 1:12:56.708
Good luck, everyone.

1:14:45.291 --> 1:14:48.750
Spirit of Miami,

1:14:48.833 --> 1:14:51.083
<i>change your speed to 150.</i>

1:14:51.166 --> 1:14:53.041
<i>Here's </i>Spirit of Miami.

1:14:53.125 --> 1:14:54.333
<i>Changing to 150.</i>

1:15:00.125 --> 1:15:02.250
<i>4-6-8 what is your altitude?</i>

1:15:02.333 --> 1:15:05.125
<i>1,700 meters. Three planes in sight.</i>

1:15:05.208 --> 1:15:06.541
Switch on your radars.

1:15:06.708 --> 1:15:09.916
Copy that.
Target locked. It's a private plane.

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.500
<i>We've got company.</i>

1:15:17.125 --> 1:15:19.083
<i>Enemy MiGs flying around us.</i>

1:15:19.583 --> 1:15:20.750
<i> There's no risk.</i>

1:15:20.833 --> 1:15:22.708
<i>Just scare tactics!</i>

1:15:22.916 --> 1:15:28.416
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>
<i>Now or never! Permission, dammit.</i>

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:31.375
-Authorized.
-4-6-5, permission granted.

1:15:36.333 --> 1:15:37.416
<i>He vanished.</i>

1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:39.500
<i> Sure he's not behind us?</i>

1:15:43.583 --> 1:15:45.166
<i>Got him!</i>

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.458
<i>Got the bastard!</i>

1:15:49.208 --> 1:15:52.125
<i>Seagull One? </i>Hear from<i> Spirit?</i>

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:53.750
<i>Negative.</i>

1:15:54.416 --> 1:15:55.958
<i>See smoke on my left?</i>

1:16:01.083 --> 1:16:02.416
<i>I see smoke!</i>

1:16:03.333 --> 1:16:05.041
The two other Cessnas?

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:06.666
Yes, still on course.

1:16:07.916 --> 1:16:11.500
<i>Stay in the zone at a low speed.</i>

1:16:12.666 --> 1:16:14.291
<i>See the MiG?</i>

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:15.875
<i>The MiG?</i>

1:16:15.958 --> 1:16:17.250
<i>Where the fuck is it?</i>

1:16:17.333 --> 1:16:18.500
<i>No...</i>

1:16:19.416 --> 1:16:20.625
<i>I see flames.</i>

1:16:20.708 --> 1:16:22.458
<i>Where are the flames?</i>

1:16:22.541 --> 1:16:24.083
<i>Damn it! Answer!</i>

1:16:25.875 --> 1:16:26.916
<i>Another plane ahead.</i>

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:28.500
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

1:16:28.583 --> 1:16:30.125
Authorized.

1:16:30.208 --> 1:16:32.000
4-6-5. Permission to fire.

1:16:32.083 --> 1:16:34.708
<i>Where the fuck is the MiG?</i>

1:16:39.583 --> 1:16:40.708
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1:16:41.041 --> 1:16:42.833
<i> Destroyed!</i>

1:16:43.375 --> 1:16:45.291
<i>Our country or death!</i>

1:16:45.666 --> 1:16:49.500
<i>They're fucking shooting!</i>

1:17:02.375 --> 1:17:04.416
<i>-</i>Hello?
-<i>Is Roque there?</i>

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:05.458
Hi René!

1:17:05.875 --> 1:17:09.583
No, he left for the weekend.
He can't be reached.

1:17:09.666 --> 1:17:11.208
<i>Is he with the Brothers?</i>

1:17:11.291 --> 1:17:14.125
No, he broke his arm. He can't fly.

1:17:14.208 --> 1:17:15.458
<i>Thank God!</i>

1:17:16.125 --> 1:17:17.416
What's going on?

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.375
<i>Turn on your TV.</i>

1:17:48.041 --> 1:17:50.500
<i>I want to ask the world</i>

1:17:50.583 --> 1:17:52.708
<i>which self-respecting country</i>

1:17:52.791 --> 1:17:54.333
<i>would be willing to accept,</i>

1:17:54.416 --> 1:17:56.625
<i>on its own territory,</i>

1:17:56.708 --> 1:17:59.666
<i>the major violations perpetrated</i>

1:17:59.750 --> 1:18:02.791
<i>against ours...</i>

1:20:13.125 --> 1:20:14.416
Come on, Irma!

1:20:14.958 --> 1:20:16.708
Don't be greedy!

1:20:17.541 --> 1:20:18.625
Little girl...

1:20:19.208 --> 1:20:20.625
you're not in Cuba anymore.

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:22.666
You don't have to save food.

1:20:31.750 --> 1:20:32.708
My girl!

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:39.083
You're different.

1:20:39.166 --> 1:20:40.083
Very?

1:20:40.166 --> 1:20:41.583
Yes.

1:20:45.166 --> 1:20:46.541
Welcome.

1:20:46.625 --> 1:20:48.375
-My girl.
-Dad.

1:20:48.958 --> 1:20:51.666
-How are you?
-Good.

1:20:53.583 --> 1:20:55.791
My child, do you remember me?

1:20:56.250 --> 1:20:58.916
I'm your great-grandmother, Teté.

1:20:59.458 --> 1:21:03.291
You were a baby
when I left Cuba.

1:21:03.833 --> 1:21:07.916
Look! This old lady is my sister Gladys.

1:21:10.750 --> 1:21:12.916
-How are you?
-Good, and you?

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.958
-Good.
-Really good, no?

1:21:36.708 --> 1:21:39.791
Leave it. I'll do that.

1:21:39.875 --> 1:21:43.041
I'll say good night to Irma.

1:21:50.625 --> 1:21:52.416
You glad to be in Miami?

1:21:53.083 --> 1:21:54.291
I'm scared.

1:22:00.250 --> 1:22:01.208
Scared of what?

1:22:02.625 --> 1:22:03.875
I don't know.

1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:05.666
Of life.

1:22:08.250 --> 1:22:09.416
Life here?

1:22:10.375 --> 1:22:11.541
Everything's different.

1:22:12.041 --> 1:22:12.875
I know.

1:22:14.875 --> 1:22:16.416
Daddy's here.

1:22:16.875 --> 1:22:18.583
You have nothing to fear.

1:22:27.416 --> 1:22:28.333
Look.

1:22:30.916 --> 1:22:32.250
This photo of Fidel...

1:22:36.875 --> 1:22:38.041
Hide it.

1:22:42.833 --> 1:22:43.750
What is it?

1:22:44.375 --> 1:22:46.333
If you were really a traitor,

1:22:46.416 --> 1:22:47.958
you'd have torn it up.

1:22:53.250 --> 1:22:54.416
Sleep well.

1:23:05.625 --> 1:23:07.291
I have some friends

1:23:08.458 --> 1:23:10.333
who said they'd help us.

1:23:10.791 --> 1:23:12.541
They mentioned

1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:16.041
a job not far from here.

1:23:16.125 --> 1:23:18.416
In an old people's home.

1:23:18.833 --> 1:23:21.916
You'll have time to take care of Irma.

1:23:25.791 --> 1:23:28.375
It'll be hard to keep Irma out of this.

1:23:28.875 --> 1:23:31.916
Better to keep things as they are.

1:23:32.250 --> 1:23:35.583
You had no problem keeping me out of it.

1:23:37.083 --> 1:23:38.750
Will you forgive me?

1:23:38.833 --> 1:23:40.208
Truth is, I don't know.

1:23:44.250 --> 1:23:45.208
I understand you.

1:23:45.291 --> 1:23:47.250
And I, you.

1:23:47.333 --> 1:23:51.208
You did it for your country,
for our Revolution.

1:23:51.875 --> 1:23:54.750
I respect that. I even admire you.

1:23:57.041 --> 1:23:58.541
But the cost was high.

1:23:58.625 --> 1:24:01.125
For us, for your family.

1:24:01.208 --> 1:24:03.833
I don't know if you realize
what we went through.

1:24:03.916 --> 1:24:07.125
For years I had a pain here
that wouldn't go away.

1:24:08.208 --> 1:24:09.875
I feel the same way.

1:24:11.791 --> 1:24:14.041
It won't be easy to forget.

1:24:14.250 --> 1:24:18.041
It's not the life I wanted
for my daughter and me.

1:24:18.541 --> 1:24:19.708
I'll make up for it--

1:24:19.791 --> 1:24:22.958
You made a decision
and we had to deal with it.

1:24:25.375 --> 1:24:28.916
Those wounds need time to heal.

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.791
Remember how old Irma was
when you left?

1:24:31.875 --> 1:24:33.833
-Come on--
-She was 6.

1:24:33.916 --> 1:24:35.208
Olga, please...

1:24:38.125 --> 1:24:41.500
Don't remind me how old she was
when I left Cuba.

1:24:42.708 --> 1:24:45.833
But remember it was your choice,

1:24:45.916 --> 1:24:47.416
not mine, not hers.

1:24:50.333 --> 1:24:53.333
I am here with you. In Miami.

1:24:53.416 --> 1:24:57.375
I never gave up on being your wife,
not even in Cuba.

1:24:57.458 --> 1:25:01.750
Being the wife of a traitor there
isn't easy.

1:25:01.833 --> 1:25:05.625
And I'm glad I made that choice.

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.166
Why do you think
I trained in radio transmission?

1:25:09.250 --> 1:25:10.708
And all that other stuff.

1:25:10.791 --> 1:25:13.750
So I can help you! To be on your side.

1:25:13.833 --> 1:25:18.041
But don't expect it to happen overnight.
I need time.

1:25:18.500 --> 1:25:21.791
I need time, and so does our daughter.

1:25:27.625 --> 1:25:30.208
You have all the time in the world.

1:25:32.416 --> 1:25:35.458
As long as you give me reason to hope.

1:25:43.416 --> 1:25:44.625
Don't worry.

1:25:45.583 --> 1:25:47.250
We're together again.

1:25:56.375 --> 1:25:57.416
Can I hope?

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000
Of course.

1:26:00.083 --> 1:26:02.916
I've always loved you. Always.

1:28:02.375 --> 1:28:04.291
Since Roque defected,

1:28:04.875 --> 1:28:06.833
Mas Canosa thinks there are more moles.

1:28:10.291 --> 1:28:14.333
It's become too dangerous for the CANF
to plan attacks on Cuba.

1:28:15.666 --> 1:28:17.666
They don't want to put the U.S. in a jam.

1:28:18.666 --> 1:28:20.541
So they have to keep

1:28:21.125 --> 1:28:22.375
a low profile.

1:28:24.166 --> 1:28:25.791
Thank you.

1:28:26.333 --> 1:28:27.958
They need a new strategy.

1:28:29.375 --> 1:28:30.875
To step up their ops.

1:28:32.375 --> 1:28:34.333
Can we implicate Mas Canosa?

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:37.375
No smoking gun.

1:28:38.833 --> 1:28:40.416
They're very cautious.

1:28:43.458 --> 1:28:45.416
And guess who's in charge.

1:28:46.875 --> 1:28:48.166
Luis Posada Carriles.

1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:53.416
Posada Carriles, that motherfucker.

1:28:55.208 --> 1:28:57.125
They're recruiting in Central America.

1:28:57.791 --> 1:28:59.958
Nicaragua, El Salvador.

1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.541
They want mercenaries.

1:29:04.083 --> 1:29:07.291
Guys who'd kill their moms for a buck.

1:29:18.166 --> 1:29:19.333
You need money?

1:29:19.791 --> 1:29:20.916
I'm good.

1:29:22.250 --> 1:29:24.541
So why you selling your car?

1:29:24.625 --> 1:29:26.541
It's my sister's. We live together.

1:29:26.625 --> 1:29:28.583
One car is enough.

1:29:30.583 --> 1:29:32.125
If you need anything,

1:29:32.666 --> 1:29:33.500
just call.

1:29:38.416 --> 1:29:39.333
You know,

1:29:40.041 --> 1:29:42.416
I have friends who'd pay a man like you,

1:29:42.833 --> 1:29:44.625
reliable and brave.

1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:46.250
I don't touch drugs.

1:29:46.625 --> 1:29:48.000
This isn't about drugs.

1:29:49.208 --> 1:29:50.625
It's about planting a bomb.

1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:51.833
What for?

1:29:52.291 --> 1:29:54.833
No questions. It's part of the deal.

1:30:02.583 --> 1:30:04.708
I'll answer you once and for all.

1:30:05.791 --> 1:30:07.666
In 1989,

1:30:07.750 --> 1:30:10.791
Cuba produced 8 million tons
of cane sugar.

1:30:11.208 --> 1:30:13.750
Today... three million or less.

1:30:14.125 --> 1:30:17.333
Without tourism,
their economy would plummet

1:30:17.416 --> 1:30:19.416
and the Castro regime would collapse.

1:30:19.750 --> 1:30:21.541
You have to hit where it hurts.

1:30:21.708 --> 1:30:23.333
Hotels, beaches.

1:30:23.416 --> 1:30:24.625
It's dangerous.

1:30:25.916 --> 1:30:27.541
15,000 Colones per bomb.

1:30:28.416 --> 1:30:30.625
And legal fees in case of trouble.

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:34.500
-Welcome to Cuba.
-Thank you.

1:33:54.083 --> 1:33:55.666
Old Havana.

1:33:57.791 --> 1:33:59.208
Sorry I'm late.

1:33:59.291 --> 1:34:00.791
My meeting just ended.

1:34:00.875 --> 1:34:03.625
We're enjoying our last day in Cuba.

1:34:03.708 --> 1:34:05.666
Tonight we'll be freezing in Toronto.

1:34:05.750 --> 1:34:08.000
Come, I booked a restaurant.

1:34:27.625 --> 1:34:28.958
What was that?

1:34:29.041 --> 1:34:31.458
Construction work at Hotel Panorama.

1:34:32.291 --> 1:34:34.125
Mind if I take off my T-shirt?

1:34:35.416 --> 1:34:36.708
Do as you please.

1:34:37.125 --> 1:34:40.791
Your pants too if you want.
You're the customer.

1:34:44.875 --> 1:34:47.666
-Why are we stuck?
-Roadblock.

1:34:49.500 --> 1:34:50.708
Something happen?

1:34:51.166 --> 1:34:53.166
Must be Fidel going somewhere.

1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:03.750
They want us somewhere else!

1:35:04.958 --> 1:35:05.916
Let's go!

1:36:06.458 --> 1:36:08.708
-Yes?
<i>-Congratulations.</i>

1:36:09.291 --> 1:36:11.541
<i>The attacks made the press.</i>

1:36:11.625 --> 1:36:13.583
I told you I don't care.

1:36:13.833 --> 1:36:16.791
I need money. I can't even afford a taxi.

1:36:16.958 --> 1:36:21.166
<i>Your money is in Havana.</i>
<i>An envelope at Hotel Capri.</i>

1:36:31.666 --> 1:36:33.708
Wait here. I'll get the money.

1:36:35.916 --> 1:36:39.125
Raúl Ernesto Cruz León. That's my name.

1:36:40.083 --> 1:36:42.208
Nothing in that name, sir.

1:36:42.291 --> 1:36:44.000
An envelope?

1:36:44.083 --> 1:36:46.625
No, this is all I have.

1:36:46.708 --> 1:36:48.791
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1:36:52.208 --> 1:36:55.166
Don't try to resist!

1:37:09.791 --> 1:37:12.291
We saw you dumping this stuff

1:37:12.375 --> 1:37:14.833
in a trash can in Cervantes Park.

1:37:15.708 --> 1:37:17.000
Recognize it?

1:37:17.958 --> 1:37:18.791
No.

1:37:19.958 --> 1:37:22.666
The explosions
at the Tritón and Chateau hotels

1:37:22.750 --> 1:37:26.291
left only minor injuries
and material damage.

1:37:26.958 --> 1:37:28.333
But at the Copacabana,

1:37:28.875 --> 1:37:32.916
an Italian tourist had his throat slit
by a metal shard.

1:37:35.291 --> 1:37:36.583
He's dead.

1:37:38.625 --> 1:37:40.125
If you cooperate...

1:37:42.041 --> 1:37:45.833
you may be able to save your ass.

1:37:47.666 --> 1:37:49.041
Otherwise...

1:37:50.583 --> 1:37:52.583
it's the firing squad.

1:38:15.416 --> 1:38:16.625
Hey, man.

1:38:17.541 --> 1:38:19.375
-Olga?
-In the bathroom.

1:38:19.916 --> 1:38:20.791
So?

1:38:21.875 --> 1:38:23.416
You have news.

1:38:24.291 --> 1:38:26.250
Mas Canosa is very sick.

1:38:27.416 --> 1:38:30.125
-How sick?
-He won't last the year.

1:38:34.291 --> 1:38:37.166
They have a plan to kill Fidel.
It's in here.

1:38:37.916 --> 1:38:39.166
As always.

1:38:39.875 --> 1:38:41.833
Mas Canosa's last wish.

1:38:43.833 --> 1:38:45.833
Last wish indeed.

1:38:47.791 --> 1:38:51.583
On Margarita Island, Venezuela.
The Ibero-American Summit.

1:38:51.666 --> 1:38:55.208
-That's very soon, barely a month away.
-Yes.

1:38:55.291 --> 1:38:59.791
They have a boat, the Esperanza,
leaving from Puerto Rico.

1:39:06.125 --> 1:39:08.958
Listen,
let's pass this on to the FBI.

1:39:09.416 --> 1:39:10.375
-The FBI?
-Yes.

1:39:13.291 --> 1:39:17.916
Catch the CANF red-handed
and we score a major victory, man.

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:23.333
Hello, Olga.

1:39:23.416 --> 1:39:25.041
-How are you?
-Good.

1:39:25.875 --> 1:39:26.875
Let's toast.

1:39:27.875 --> 1:39:29.500
To what?

1:39:29.583 --> 1:39:31.291
Cruz León's arrest.

1:39:31.375 --> 1:39:34.333
Four bombs. One dead tourist.

1:39:35.375 --> 1:39:37.541
-You feel responsible?
-Sure.

1:39:37.958 --> 1:39:39.916
We're here to stop that.

1:39:40.416 --> 1:39:41.791
We did what we can.

1:39:41.875 --> 1:39:45.916
We tracked them down,
dismantled their organization.

1:39:46.333 --> 1:39:48.125
The recruiter is on the run now.

1:39:48.208 --> 1:39:50.833
But we have reasons to celebrate.

1:39:50.916 --> 1:39:51.750
Indeed.

1:39:52.458 --> 1:39:55.041
We have some good news for you.

1:39:56.250 --> 1:39:57.625
What's happening?

1:39:58.750 --> 1:39:59.791
I'm pregnant!

1:40:01.583 --> 1:40:02.458
Yes.

1:40:02.833 --> 1:40:05.541
We waited to tell you until we were sure.

1:40:05.625 --> 1:40:07.375
Now we are.

1:40:07.458 --> 1:40:09.250
I had an ultrasound.

1:40:09.333 --> 1:40:11.750
Everything's fine. It's a girl.

1:40:11.833 --> 1:40:13.791
Congratulations! Great news.

1:40:13.875 --> 1:40:15.333
-Thank you.
-Got a name yet?

1:40:15.416 --> 1:40:18.083
-Yes, Ivett.
-Ivett.

1:40:18.166 --> 1:40:20.666
-Pretty, isn't it?
-Yes, very.

1:40:20.750 --> 1:40:22.208
Ivett... I like it.

1:40:22.500 --> 1:40:24.833
-How is Irma doing?
-Fine.

1:40:24.916 --> 1:40:27.250
She speaks fluent English.

1:40:27.750 --> 1:40:30.333
-Irma is jealous, of course.
-Hmm.

1:40:30.416 --> 1:40:32.166
But she'll get over it.

1:40:33.583 --> 1:40:37.291
We all have to. Just watch out.

1:40:37.375 --> 1:40:39.375
I know, poor thing.

1:40:39.458 --> 1:40:41.250
But there's no other remedy

1:40:41.333 --> 1:40:43.250
but to learn she's not the center.

1:43:06.791 --> 1:43:10.583
You think
the heads of the CANF will be affected

1:43:10.666 --> 1:43:13.916
by the Cuban intel given to the FBI?

1:43:14.375 --> 1:43:15.875
Well...

1:43:16.375 --> 1:43:19.708
Mas Canosa is not around anymore.
He passed.

1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:25.250
He always said
he didn't want to know of my activities.

1:43:25.500 --> 1:43:29.583
I don't think the CANF

1:43:30.291 --> 1:43:31.750
will be upset.

1:43:32.875 --> 1:43:35.083
But the communist Cubans

1:43:35.750 --> 1:43:39.875
have a lot to worry about.

1:43:39.958 --> 1:43:41.583
Why would you say that?

1:43:42.166 --> 1:43:43.375
Do the math.

1:43:43.916 --> 1:43:46.291
Where does Cuban intel come from?

1:43:46.708 --> 1:43:50.791
A Cuban spy ring in Miami.

1:43:50.875 --> 1:43:52.250
Honestly...

1:43:52.708 --> 1:43:57.583
you think the FBI
can tolerate such activities

1:43:57.666 --> 1:43:59.916
on American soil?

1:44:01.291 --> 1:44:02.791
I highly doubt it.

1:44:02.875 --> 1:44:05.458
I highly doubt it.

1:44:07.291 --> 1:44:08.250
Good afternoon.

1:44:16.541 --> 1:44:17.541
Fine.

1:44:18.041 --> 1:44:20.958
Yes, yes. Some other time.
Sorry to bother you.

1:44:21.041 --> 1:44:22.500
Thank you very much.

1:44:39.791 --> 1:44:41.500
-How's it going?
-Great.

1:44:41.583 --> 1:44:43.708
-How about your exam?
-9/10.

1:44:44.708 --> 1:44:45.958
Hey, honey.

1:44:46.041 --> 1:44:50.000
Here on Friday?
No <i>Movimiento Democracia</i> meeting?

1:44:50.083 --> 1:44:52.375
It's next week instead.

1:44:52.458 --> 1:44:53.791
Great.

1:44:53.875 --> 1:44:56.916
So I'm home. Enjoying a rest.

1:44:57.791 --> 1:44:58.625
What about you?

1:44:58.708 --> 1:45:02.416
Can you change her?
I smell something off.

1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:03.916
Something off?

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.458
What did you do?

1:45:07.041 --> 1:45:08.291
I'll help.

1:45:13.333 --> 1:45:15.500
That's why you're crying.

1:45:41.416 --> 1:45:43.000
Look at me!

1:45:43.416 --> 1:45:44.416
What?

1:45:44.833 --> 1:45:46.833
Nice light. I want a picture.

1:45:46.916 --> 1:45:48.708
In my underwear?

1:45:48.791 --> 1:45:52.083
Closer. I want the three of you.

1:45:55.791 --> 1:45:58.000
Look at the camera!

1:47:42.375 --> 1:47:43.541
Yes.

1:47:49.250 --> 1:47:50.875
Olga, don't worry, my love.

1:49:56.333 --> 1:49:57.958
Such bad manners.

1:49:58.041 --> 1:50:00.750
-What?
-Nothing. Don't look.

1:50:28.666 --> 1:50:31.083
Amarylis, it's me Olga.

1:50:32.541 --> 1:50:34.250
Good and you?

1:50:34.625 --> 1:50:36.125
Imagine here!

1:50:36.458 --> 1:50:39.208
I need a favor.

1:50:40.125 --> 1:50:42.500
Can you get Ivett to daycare?

1:50:42.666 --> 1:50:45.583
You have no idea of the circus here.

1:51:25.333 --> 1:51:26.875
<i> Please let me come.</i>

1:51:27.375 --> 1:51:31.250
I'd love to. But you know you can't.

1:51:31.791 --> 1:51:34.625
And you must watch your sister.

1:51:35.291 --> 1:51:38.208
In this bag, milk, water and diapers.

1:51:38.291 --> 1:51:39.958
Tell Daddy I love him.

1:51:40.583 --> 1:51:42.833
Believe me, he'll be overjoyed.

1:51:42.916 --> 1:51:44.708
He sacrificed his family.

1:51:44.791 --> 1:51:46.000
Don't say that!

1:51:46.500 --> 1:51:50.541
Your father is brave,
guilty only of fighting for his country.

1:51:50.625 --> 1:51:52.750
-How about us?
-He does his duty.

1:51:53.208 --> 1:51:54.875
I wish he wasn't a soldier.

1:51:54.958 --> 1:51:56.750
I won't tell him that.

1:52:01.166 --> 1:52:04.000
I'll say his daughter is like him.

1:52:04.750 --> 1:52:06.333
Strong and courageous.

1:52:07.416 --> 1:52:08.250
Can I?

1:52:09.541 --> 1:52:10.958
Hey, can I?

1:52:13.833 --> 1:52:15.625
I'm getting by.

1:52:15.708 --> 1:52:17.666
I was able to keep my job.

1:52:17.750 --> 1:52:18.666
I'm glad.

1:52:18.750 --> 1:52:21.041
My boss is a good man.

1:52:21.125 --> 1:52:22.875
<i>Who'd have thought?</i>

1:52:28.875 --> 1:52:29.708
<i>What?</i>

1:52:31.083 --> 1:52:34.208
<i>I'm trying to imagine your life in jail.</i>

1:52:36.250 --> 1:52:39.833
<i>I'm in a 6-by-12 foot cell.</i>

1:52:41.875 --> 1:52:45.916
<i>The only light comes</i>
<i>from a horizontal slat.</i>

1:52:47.125 --> 1:52:51.875
<i>20 inches long, 6 inches wide.</i>
<i>High up and out of reach.</i>

1:52:53.583 --> 1:52:54.708
That's my life.

1:52:57.541 --> 1:53:00.708
<i>And the girls?</i>
<i>How are they dealing with it?</i>

1:53:00.791 --> 1:53:03.416
<i>It's tough, especially for Irma.</i>

1:53:03.833 --> 1:53:05.166
<i>But we're okay.</i>

1:53:10.625 --> 1:53:12.208
<i>The FBI offered me a plea deal.</i>

1:53:13.541 --> 1:53:15.333
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1:53:16.583 --> 1:53:18.833
<i>Informing for a reduced sentence.</i>

1:53:22.291 --> 1:53:23.125
<i>And?</i>

1:53:23.708 --> 1:53:26.333
<i>Five of the others agreed to it.</i>

1:53:26.666 --> 1:53:27.916
They'll speak?

1:53:30.625 --> 1:53:33.208
<i>You won't cooperate, will you?</i>

1:53:36.708 --> 1:53:39.416
<i>You and the girls will be deported</i>
<i>if I don't.</i>

1:53:42.541 --> 1:53:45.166
<i> Mr. President, as you know,</i>

1:53:45.250 --> 1:53:48.708
<i>10 Cuban Americans, of Cuban origin,</i>

1:53:48.791 --> 1:53:51.208
<i>were arrested and accused</i>

1:53:51.291 --> 1:53:54.541
<i>of spying for your government.</i>
<i>What can you say about this?</i>

1:53:54.625 --> 1:53:58.208
<i>What struck me, and we denounced it</i>

1:53:58.291 --> 1:53:59.916
<i>to the U.N.,</i>

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.833
<i>was how amazing it was</i>

1:54:03.333 --> 1:54:07.250
<i>that the biggest spy in the world...</i>

1:54:08.291 --> 1:54:10.500
<i>would accuse of espionage</i>

1:54:10.708 --> 1:54:14.666
<i>the most spied upon country</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1:54:15.250 --> 1:54:19.583
<i>Yes, we have sent Cuban citizens</i>

1:54:20.500 --> 1:54:22.375
<i>to infiltrate</i>

1:54:23.791 --> 1:54:26.458
<i>counter-revolutionary organizations.</i>

1:54:27.750 --> 1:54:29.416
<i>In order to report back</i>

1:54:30.666 --> 1:54:33.500
<i>on activities of great interest to us.</i>

1:54:33.583 --> 1:54:36.208
<i>And I think we have the right to do so.</i>

1:54:36.708 --> 1:54:41.791
<i>As long as the U.S. tolerates</i>
<i>the organization of sabotage,</i>

1:54:42.125 --> 1:54:44.500
<i>armed incursions,</i>

1:54:44.833 --> 1:54:49.833
<i>attacks of tourist facilities,</i>

1:54:50.958 --> 1:54:54.625
<i>smuggling weapons and explosives,</i>

1:54:54.708 --> 1:54:58.541
<i>and attacks on our economy,</i>
<i>our tourism industry.</i>

1:54:58.625 --> 1:55:02.041
<i>All these things which we have denounced.</i>

1:55:31.916 --> 1:55:33.333
<i>Little darling...</i>

1:55:33.416 --> 1:55:36.333
Give a kiss to Daddy,
give him a kiss.

1:55:45.500 --> 1:55:48.375
<i>-Show him your duck.</i>
-My love.

1:55:54.416 --> 1:55:56.625
Ducky fell again?

1:55:56.708 --> 1:55:59.333
Another kiss.

1:56:13.791 --> 1:56:14.958
<i>She's a beauty.</i>

1:56:17.291 --> 1:56:19.375
<i>Prettier than her pictures.</i>

1:56:21.916 --> 1:56:26.166
<i>I brought you a package.</i>
<i>They need to check it first.</i>

1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:28.625
<i>I'll get it later.</i>

1:56:28.708 --> 1:56:30.750
Mostly food and books.

1:56:31.500 --> 1:56:33.291
<i>It's your birthday, remember?</i>

1:56:36.541 --> 1:56:38.333
<i>I'm sorry Irma isn't here.</i>

1:56:39.125 --> 1:56:41.208
She's safer in Cuba.

1:56:41.291 --> 1:56:42.166
<i>I know.</i>

1:56:42.250 --> 1:56:46.375
She's with her Granny,
who takes good care of her.

1:56:46.541 --> 1:56:48.458
-You speak?
<i>-Every day.</i>

1:56:48.541 --> 1:56:50.041
<i>School's going well?</i>

1:56:50.125 --> 1:56:53.000
Yes. And she asks about you every day.

1:56:56.041 --> 1:56:57.958
<i>I can't talk to her yet.</i>

1:57:00.166 --> 1:57:01.541
<i>It's too painful.</i>

1:57:04.375 --> 1:57:06.250
<i>Tell her Daddy loves her.</i>

1:57:06.333 --> 1:57:08.416
<i>I tell her that every day.</i>

1:57:08.791 --> 1:57:12.583
<i>When things get better,</i>
<i>we'll be together again.</i>

1:57:19.041 --> 1:57:20.833
<i>You know it won't be soon.</i>

1:57:25.500 --> 1:57:28.625
<i>You and Ivett will go to Cuba</i>
<i>to join Irma.</i>

1:57:30.166 --> 1:57:31.416
<i>Then what?</i>

1:57:34.041 --> 1:57:35.500
<i>I won't cooperate.</i>

1:57:37.291 --> 1:57:38.958
<i>I just told my lawyer.</i>

1:57:40.916 --> 1:57:43.250
<i>I can't testify against my brothers.</i>

1:57:44.250 --> 1:57:45.375
<i>I just can't.</i>

1:57:47.458 --> 1:57:50.791
<i>Even those</i>
<i>who testify against you?</i>

1:57:50.875 --> 1:57:51.708
No.

1:57:52.291 --> 1:57:54.083
<i>Their morals aren't mine.</i>

1:57:58.208 --> 1:58:00.250
<i>Tell me if I have your support.</i>

1:58:00.750 --> 1:58:02.416
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

1:58:03.458 --> 1:58:06.833
<i>We'll be separated for a while.</i>
<i>You know that.</i>

1:58:13.375 --> 1:58:15.833
<i>I won't let you go through this alone.</i>

1:58:17.041 --> 1:58:20.416
I'll visit you as often as they let me.

1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:22.666
<i>I'll always be there for you.</i>

1:58:23.041 --> 1:58:24.708
<i>And for our daughters.</i>

1:58:25.583 --> 1:58:26.958
<i>I promise.</i>

1:58:55.291 --> 1:58:57.208
Sure you won't stay?

1:58:57.375 --> 1:58:59.541
I have to go.

1:58:59.875 --> 1:59:01.750
We must be prepared.

1:59:01.833 --> 1:59:03.791
I understand.

1:59:06.291 --> 1:59:09.166
When things clear up,
I'll come back for her.

1:59:09.250 --> 1:59:10.916
And if they don't?

1:59:11.375 --> 1:59:15.791
Then she'll stay with you for a while.

1:59:15.875 --> 1:59:18.625
I know you'll tend to her
as if you were her mother.

1:59:19.625 --> 1:59:20.541
Thank you.

1:59:23.666 --> 1:59:25.583
Teté.

1:59:25.666 --> 1:59:29.166
Look at her, so tiny. And so sweet.

1:59:41.791 --> 1:59:43.333
Mama.

1:59:48.541 --> 1:59:51.291
We'll see each other soon.
Look at me.

1:59:51.375 --> 1:59:52.666
Look at Mommy.

1:59:56.541 --> 2:00:02.291
I love you.

2:00:02.375 --> 2:00:05.375
A little kiss.

2:00:15.791 --> 2:00:18.708
Come with Grandma.

2:00:20.166 --> 2:00:21.750
Bye!

2:00:21.833 --> 2:00:25.750
See you soon!

2:00:25.833 --> 2:00:27.458
I love you.

2:00:27.541 --> 2:00:29.250
-I adore you.
-Bye, Mommy!

2:00:29.333 --> 2:00:30.708
Thank you, Teté.

2:00:30.791 --> 2:00:31.916
I love you.

2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:33.875
-Bye-bye, Mommy!

2:00:33.958 --> 2:00:35.791
-See you soon.

2:00:46.333 --> 2:00:49.083
Mommy!

2:00:55.750 --> 2:00:57.083
See you, Mommy!

2:00:58.750 --> 2:01:00.625
Mommy.
