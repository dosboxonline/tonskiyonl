WEBVTT

00:14.541 --> 00:16.875
THE WATCHER: In a campaign
of fire and blood,

00:16.958 --> 00:21.000
King Odin sought to unite the Nine Realms
under the Throne of Asgard.

00:21.958 --> 00:26.375
His chief weapon in the conquest
that built his empire, his executioner,

00:26.458 --> 00:30.416
and first-born daughter, Hela,
the Goddess of Death.

00:32.250 --> 00:36.541
One by one, the branches of
the World's Tree fell under their control.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.583
But Hela hungered for more.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.208
Do you not see?

00:46.291 --> 00:50.166
The entire cosmos is out there
waiting to be ruled.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.666
And yet you wish to stop at nine realms.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.875
There comes a point in time, my dear,

00:56.166 --> 00:59.583
when a warrior must lay down his sword
and give up the fight.

00:59.666 --> 01:01.125
And if I refuse?

01:01.208 --> 01:02.708
Then you will be made to!

01:03.625 --> 01:06.208
THE WATCHER: Unable to quench
his daughter's thirst for blood,

01:06.291 --> 01:08.125
the Allfather opted to contain it,

01:08.208 --> 01:11.041
-and imprisoned her in Hell.
-(SCREAMS)

01:11.916 --> 01:13.666
THE WATCHER: But, in this universe,

01:14.208 --> 01:17.458
Hela's insolence inspired another idea.

01:17.541 --> 01:20.291
(LAUGHING) Forgive me.
It's just rich, is all.

01:20.833 --> 01:24.416
You wanting me to "give up the fight,"

01:24.500 --> 01:27.541
when that's all you ever raised me to do.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.875
You see, Father,
without a fight, I'm no one.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.625
-No!
-ODIN: Oh, my child.

01:36.708 --> 01:39.083
No god should have dominion over death

01:39.166 --> 01:41.625
who has so little appreciation for life!

(GASPS)

01:51.583 --> 01:54.291
Father, you cannot do this to me.
You will not!

01:55.041 --> 01:56.625
ODIN: In the name of my father,

01:56.708 --> 01:58.625
and his father before...

(ELECTRICAL BUZZING)

02:05.875 --> 02:06.916
No, no.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.250
No! (SCREAMS) No!

02:12.500 --> 02:15.625
Whosoever wears this crown,
should she know mercy,

02:15.708 --> 02:18.041
shall possess the power of Hela.

Xu Wenwu knew all too well

03:01.625 --> 03:06.625
the most powerful forces on Earth
often come from beyond.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.208
THE WATCHER: Time.

03:17.625 --> 03:18.625
Space.

03:20.291 --> 03:21.375
Reality.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.041
It's more than a linear path.

03:30.833 --> 03:35.416
It's a prism of endless possibility,

03:37.833 --> 03:41.458
where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,

03:44.083 --> 03:47.041
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.

03:50.958 --> 03:52.291
I am the Watcher.

03:54.416 --> 03:57.541
I am your guide

"What if?"

04:24.958 --> 04:27.708
But Wenwu was about to discover someone

I'm not most people.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.375
He nurtured it, exploited it,

My quarrel's with a man named Wenwu.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.833
Well, technically, it's with my father.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.041
So, I guess you could say
it was both of them.

13:37.125 --> 13:40.208
Also, my dad has this new girlfriend.
Frigga. She's a dreadful woman.

13:40.291 --> 13:43.041
Not really a fan of hers either.
So, yeah, it's just those three.

13:43.875 --> 13:49.625
So, don't suppose I could interest you all
in taking up arms in my name?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.833
That sounds like a pass.
Yes, totally get it.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.000
But these threats of the Underworld
you speak of,

13:56.083 --> 13:59.541
you wouldn't happen to know
of any of them looking for work?

13:59.625 --> 14:04.958
(SIGHS) One cannot fend off darkness
with more darkness, only light.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.875
Yes, that's a lovely sentiment,
to be sure.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.291
It's just a bit esoteric, is all.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.916
But if you were to teach me
your practice...

14:15.541 --> 14:17.958
And why would we agree to do that?

14:18.291 --> 14:22.916
Because you are sworn to protect
this realm from the Underworld,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.208
and I am the Goddess of Death.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.458
And what better way to secure your mission

14:27.541 --> 14:30.916
than by recruiting me to your cause?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.041
You know, the whole
"fending off darkness with light" thing.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.833

Wherever Hela is gone,
I can no longer see her.

at the hands of these mortals?

15:14.416 --> 15:15.458
(SIGHS)

15:16.291 --> 15:20.583
There is one who is
in possession of a great power.

15:21.041 --> 15:24.875
Ten rings that could even destroy a god.

15:24.958 --> 15:28.333
Mmm. If such power
indeed exists on Midgard,

15:28.416 --> 15:30.958
there's no telling what its people
could be capable of.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.166

Maybe not with the flowers, though.

Mmm, there's really not a lot of room

Because you will be sitting

15:59.500 --> 16:02.375
And we can expect
to get to the fighting when?

16:02.458 --> 16:04.125
You already know how to fight.

16:04.416 --> 16:07.916
But our practice requires
a cultivation of your inner world.
