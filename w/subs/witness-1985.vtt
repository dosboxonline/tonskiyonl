04:34.483 --> 04:36.030
Jacob was a good farmer.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.200
- None better.
- But not the man to buy a horse for you.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.203
Hochleitner, wasn't it your father
sold him the horse...

04:42.282 --> 04:44.284
with a ruptured testicle?

04:45.535 --> 04:48.539
He told him it was a bee sting
that made him limp that way.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.384
That horse had one good ball,
that's all it takes.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.750
Rachel...

05:29.371 --> 05:31.248
I'm sorry about Jacob.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.551
I know he will walk with God.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.091
Thank you, Daniel.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.050
- She'll be here.
- I hope so.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.928
Daniel.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.722
So, first time to the big city?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.392
You'll see so many things.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.895
Close your eyes.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.446
Open.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.787
Samuel, careful!

08:14.369 --> 08:16.087
You come back soon.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.752
Samuel!

08:33.763 --> 08:36.437
And you be careful
out among the English.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.802
Mama, look!

10:01.101 --> 10:03.320
He's a cute little Amish boy.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.362
Isn't he cute? I think so.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.905
We have tickets to Baltimore.
Where is that train, please?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.326
It's delayed three hours...

10:10.401 --> 10:12.529
you'll hear it announced
when it's time to board.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.285
- Take a seat right over there.
- But I-

10:14.364 --> 10:16.492
Just take a seat.
I have to wait on these people.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.917
- Yes, sir.
- There?

10:22.163 --> 10:24.382
Mama, look, what's that thing?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.614
Don't go far, Samuel.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.072
Mama?

12:15.818 --> 12:17.445
It's over there.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.662
Samuel.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.150
Hey. man!

14:16.606 --> 14:18.608
What the fuck you doing, man?

14:19.859 --> 14:22.078
- Washing my hands, man.
- What?

14:23.446 --> 14:25.869
- Let's get out of here.
- Hold tight.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.431
I already did that.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.146
Just checking again.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.748
Move these people back,
they shouldn't be this close.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.917
Get Schaeffer on the phone,
get him down here, now.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.335
Right.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.167
- Precherd, who found the body?
- Right over there, sir.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.093
How you doing, pop?
You found the body?

16:43.211 --> 16:45.509
Not me, daddy, I just reported it.
It was the kid.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.431
- What kid?
- How the hell do I know what kid?

16:47.548 --> 16:50.597
It was the kid
in the funny black threads. Over there.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.596
Thanks, pop.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.936
How's he doing?

17:00.853 --> 17:04.107
I'm a police officer, ma'am.
I have to talk to the boy.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.945
What's your name?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.285
Samuel.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.615
- Samuel Lapp.
- And he's your son?

17:14.407 --> 17:16.705
We were on our way to Baltimore.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.460
My sister is expecting us.
Soon our train is leaving.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.958
We'll get you on another train.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.962
Sam, the man who was killed tonight...

17:25.962 --> 17:29.637
was a policeman, and it's my job
to find out what happened.

17:30.716 --> 17:35.062
I want you to tell me everything you saw
when you went in the bathroom.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.981
There were two.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.233
- There were two men?
- I only saw one.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.740
Does anybody know about this?

17:46.816 --> 17:49.319
No, nobody's had a chance
to talk to him.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.326
What did he look like?
The man that you saw.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.494
He was like him.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.830
He was a black man?
He had black skin?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.340
<i>But not schtumpig.</i>

18:04.250 --> 18:06.503
<i>Schtumpig? What's schtumpig?</i>

18:06.586 --> 18:09.089
On a farm,
when a pig is born small like that...

18:09.171 --> 18:10.969
<i>he's schtumpig.</i>

18:11.674 --> 18:12.926
A runt.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.689
So, he wasn't a runt.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.644
He was a big guy, like me?

18:23.185 --> 18:24.687
Big guy.

18:25.146 --> 18:28.491
<i>Subject is armed. He's wanted
for the stabbing deaths of a narcotic...</i>

18:28.566 --> 18:30.409
I should have been there, John.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.452
I told you.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.783
That's not the point. That's the risk.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.790
Undercover, one mistake,
bang, they kill you-

18:39.869 --> 18:41.871
Where are you taking us?

18:43.539 --> 18:44.882
I'm sorry.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.210
We're looking for a suspect.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.137
We got reason to believe
he's still in the neighbourhood.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.135
I want the little boy to take a look at him.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.637
You have no right to keep us here.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.226
Yes, I do. Your son
is a material witness to a homicide.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.726
You don't understand.
We want nothing to do with your laws.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.402
Doesn't surprise me.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.903
A lot of people I meet are like that.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.080
What did he say?

19:17.573 --> 19:20.747
He asked who you are. Your name.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.748
I told him we didn't need
to know anything about you.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.753
Book. John Book.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.928
Hey, man, where're you hiding?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.791
Have a seat.
Young blood, where're you going?

20:17.466 --> 20:19.434
Looking good, T-Bone.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.476
- Hey, man, how're you doing?
- What the fuck?

20:26.267 --> 20:29.487
- I'll sue you, man!
- Gotta get his arm. Let's get his arm.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.823
Is this the man, Sam? Is this him?

20:33.482 --> 20:34.825
You sure?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.996
- Back off.
- You listen to me.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.241
I want no further part of this,
nor does my son.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.668
Okay. Get back in the car.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.834
Honest mistake, all right.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.599
John, what are we gonna do with them?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.597
- What?
- A hotel or what?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.929
Put them in a hotel,
they won't be there in the morning.

21:03.012 --> 21:06.357
- I'll have to send to Baltimore for them.
- Well, what?

21:08.184 --> 21:09.686
I got it.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.528
This is my sister, Elaine.
This is Mrs Lapp and Samuel.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.361
Where do you want them, Elaine?
The back bedroom, blue room?

21:18.444 --> 21:20.822
Yeah, sure. The blue room.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.867
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.873
Right back there, Sam. It's in the back.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.874
How could you do this to me tonight?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.459
It's important.

21:33.876 --> 21:37.221
Just keep going straight through,
there's a folding cot for your son.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.557
He turned on the light, good.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.146
I told you I had company.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.064
- Where's Jason and Billy?
- Upstairs, asleep.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.229
You got a man in the house
and the kids are upstairs?

21:49.350 --> 21:52.729
That's none of your business. So keep
your holier-than-thou mouth shut.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.652
- Anyway, they like Fred.
- Fred? Now we got a Fred.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.735
- Who are these orphans, anyway?
- They're Amish.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.586
- Everything okay?
- Yes. Thank you.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.260
<i>- John says you're Amish.
- Yes.</i>

22:30.432 --> 22:32.434
Do we have to stay here?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.734
No, we don't. Just for the night.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.942
Say Your prayers.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.953
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi, Bob.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.002
When can we leave the city?

22:54.123 --> 22:57.297
<i>I'm trying to get this over with
as quick as I can, then you can go.</i>

22:57.418 --> 22:58.590
Good.

22:58.669 --> 23:02.048
Samuel's probably going to have to
come back and testify. I'm sorry.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.633
No, you're not, you're glad.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.351
- Glad?
- Because now you have a witness.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.015
Yeah, now I got a witness.

23:08.137 --> 23:12.688
I just don't like my son spending all
his time with a man who carries a gun...

23:12.808 --> 23:15.687
- and goes around whacking people.
- Whacking?

23:20.149 --> 23:21.696
Come here, kiddo.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.616
Big guy.

23:26.989 --> 23:30.163
Now, don't be frightened. You can
see them, but they can't see you.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.834
I want the hats and the sunglasses off.
Straighten up.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.876
I want you to tell me
if any of these men...

23:39.001 --> 23:42.881
are the man that you saw
in the bathroom. Take your time.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.224
Look real carefully.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.559
Make sure.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.645
Are you sure?

23:59.730 --> 24:00.902
Okay.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.696
Three dogs to stay.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.912
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:14.161 --> 24:17.085
- These, we call Wurst.
- Sure.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.458
Your sister said you don't have a family.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.457
No, I don't.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.801
She thinks that you ought to get
married and have children of your own...

25:02.918 --> 25:06.263
- instead of trying to be a father to hers.
- Oh, yeah?

25:06.588 --> 25:10.092
Except she thinks
you're afraid of the responsibility.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.272
That's interesting, anything else?

25:16.598 --> 25:17.690
Yeah.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.654
She said that
she thinks that you like policing...

25:22.771 --> 25:24.899
because you think
you're right about everything...

25:24.982 --> 25:27.610
and that you're the only one
who can do anything.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.445
And that...

25:30.112 --> 25:32.991
when you drink a lot of beer,
you say things like:

25:34.116 --> 25:37.666
"None of the other police know
a crook...

25:37.828 --> 25:41.002
"from a bag of elbows. "

25:44.960 --> 25:46.962
I believe that's what she said.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.800
Good appetite.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.698
Captain.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.152
- Yeah?
- Sgt Carter for you on Line 23.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.412
Thanks.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.871
How are you doing?

26:21.038 --> 26:23.086
- I don't know.
- Little boy.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.297
Look, he's shy.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.003
Hey! Knock it off.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.381
Knock it off!

29:07.079 --> 29:08.501
I'll get it.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.086
- Hi.
- Hi, Kathy.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.005
Dad!

29:16.755 --> 29:19.053
- Hello, Marilyn.
- Hi, John.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.851
It's McFee, Paul.
He's one of them, anyway.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.354
Positive ID from the Amish kid.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.360
McFee? Lieutenant Narcotics?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.446
Right.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.536
I hope you don't have
any doubt about that.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.577
It all fits, Paul. Four years ago...

29:42.698 --> 29:46.202
Narcotics runs a raid
in which, amongst other things...

29:46.451 --> 29:49.580
550 gallons of this P-2-P stuff
is confiscated.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.878
They put it in Police Storage.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.420
Philadelphia supplies all the
major cities in the country with speed.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.344
They need this P-2-P stuff
to make the speed.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.393
They pay up to $5,000 a pint for it.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.594
I call Police Storage...

30:05.220 --> 30:08.724
no record of 1055-gallon drums
of P-2-P.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.435
That's $22 million, Paul.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.530
Guess who ran the raid four years ago?

30:16.023 --> 30:17.821
- McFee.
- Right.

30:19.234 --> 30:23.034
- Have you talked to him about it?
- No. On vacation, Florida.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.829
All right,
what do you need to clean this up?

30:26.908 --> 30:29.002
People from outside the department.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.502
Put some guys on this McFee,
watch him, wait him out.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.131
Right. FBI or maybe somebody
from Treasury. I'll take care of that.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.758
I want maximum security on this.
Where's the boy?

30:38.837 --> 30:39.963
<i>At my sister's house.</i>

30:40.047 --> 30:42.766
He's going to have to be moved.
Who else knows about this?

30:42.841 --> 30:45.014
- Just you and I.
- Let's leave it that way.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.077
Twila, get back!

31:44.152 --> 31:46.075
Police! Back in the elevator!

31:47.989 --> 31:50.117
That's our car!

31:50.200 --> 31:51.998
- Get in the elevator!
- I don't give a shit.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.203
You idiot!

31:53.286 --> 31:54.754
Get down!

32:01.211 --> 32:02.963
I know you, asshole!

32:37.622 --> 32:39.670
- Ýt's John. Says you have to leave now.
- What?

32:39.749 --> 32:42.593
He says it's urgent. I don't know.
Get dressed quickly.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.015
John!

32:48.467 --> 32:51.437
Put my car in the garage
and close the door.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.139
John, I don't understand any of this.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.475
You don't know anything. Okay?

32:56.766 --> 32:59.940
I borrowed your car. All right?
I didn't say why.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.279
You never heard of that woman
and her boy.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.532
John, please tell me why.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.997
Just do it.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.495
You said we would be safe
in Philadelphia.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.997
Well, I was wrong.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.837
Did you deliver the kid's interview
to Schaeffer?

33:26.922 --> 33:28.014
No.

33:28.381 --> 33:32.306
I want all the paperwork
on this job disappeared tonight...

33:32.385 --> 33:33.557
you understand?

33:33.845 --> 33:35.813
John, do you know
what you're telling me to do?

33:35.931 --> 33:37.524
Just do it, man.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.106
I'm going to disappear
for a couple of days.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.188
John, what's going on, man?
What is happening?

33:43.813 --> 33:45.815
I'll call you when I can.

33:45.899 --> 33:49.073
And, partner, watch your back.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.996
Schaeffe?s in this thing, too.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.016
- Shit!
- What're you doing?

34:16.096 --> 34:17.643
Working late, man.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.438
What's going on?

34:27.524 --> 34:28.867
That's it.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.132
Hey, Fergie?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.215
Told you I hit him.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.802
He's in trouble. I want to help him.
I want you to help him.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.307
- We need to know where he is.
- What kind of trouble?

34:57.387 --> 34:59.640
It's a departmental matter,
you don't have to worry about it.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.817
Ýf we can just talk to him,
we can straighten it out.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.609
- A departmental matter?
- Right.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.608
You're saying he's involved
in something illegal?

35:05.687 --> 35:07.155
I'm afraid so.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.985
Anybody who knows John
knows that's a goddamn lie.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.991
<i>Of course it is, Elaine.
But as long as there's any doubt...</i>

35:14.070 --> 35:16.539
it's better that John
should come in and clear his name.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.494
It's better you should
get off my property.

35:19.826 --> 35:23.171
I don't want to have to take you in
for questioning.

35:23.413 --> 35:25.962
He left with the Amish woman, right?

35:31.504 --> 35:34.633
- She say where he is?
- I don't think she knows.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.843
- What about Carter?
- Tight.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.349
But I'm working on him.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.463
Samuel!

36:08.083 --> 36:09.209
<i>Opa.</i>

36:19.344 --> 36:20.937
You should rest.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.848
I'll make us some coffee.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.605
No, I can't stay.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.953
Will you be coming back
to take Samuel to trial?

36:41.616 --> 36:43.789
There isn't going to be any trial.

36:45.787 --> 36:46.913
Rachel?

36:49.082 --> 36:52.382
What happened? Who was that man?

37:17.026 --> 37:18.528
Mama.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.326
John?

37:28.163 --> 37:30.336
My God,
why didn't you get to a hospital?

37:30.415 --> 37:31.792
No doctor.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.591
Gunshot wound,
they have to make a report...

37:35.795 --> 37:38.423
and if they make a report, they find me...

37:38.548 --> 37:40.846
and if they find me, they find the boy.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.114
- Is the English dead?
- No.

38:03.323 --> 38:04.700
Looks dead.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.560
Come.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.567
He's upstairs.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.595
I feel burning.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.097
The bullet entered there...

39:09.639 --> 39:11.391
and came out there.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.649
There's danger of infection.

39:15.979 --> 39:19.199
He's lost a great deal of blood.
I'm not a doctor.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.618
This man should be treated
in a hospital.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.405
- There's nothing I can do for him.
- No.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.741
No. He must stay here.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.578
What if he dies?

39:31.870 --> 39:35.215
Then the Sheriff will come here.
They'll say we broke their laws.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.418
But then we must pray that
he doesn't die...

39:37.500 --> 39:40.595
but if he does, then we must find a way,
so no one knows.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.719
But, Rachel, this is a man's life.
We hold it in our hands.

39:43.798 --> 39:44.970
I know that.

39:45.091 --> 39:49.096
God help me, I know that, Eli.
But I'll tell you if he's found...

39:49.304 --> 39:52.649
the people who did this to him
will come get Samuel.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.071
Then make a poultice.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.951
Three parts milk, two parts linseed oil,
for the infection.

40:03.651 --> 40:07.201
I will send Mary by with some teas
I will brew myself.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.416
Thank you.

40:24.839 --> 40:28.389
Lapp, I'll have to speak with the elders
on this matter.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.345
As you see fit.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.350
You shouldn't.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.522
Don't do it.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.604
I'll fucking kill you.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.860
You asshole.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.954
He's the one...

42:24.792 --> 42:25.918
John?

43:15.510 --> 43:19.856
Are you trying to tell me that there's
no way we can locate this woman?

43:20.098 --> 43:23.443
We're talking about 20th century
law enforcement, Sergeant.

43:23.518 --> 43:26.362
<i>Well, there's your problem, Chief.
Your Amish man doesn't live...</i>

43:26.437 --> 43:28.940
<i>in the 20th century,
doesn't think in the 20th century.</i>

43:29.023 --> 43:31.071
<i>Chief, if the Amish have taken
your man in...</i>

43:31.150 --> 43:34.029
<i>I wouldn't want to hang from a rope
until you find him.</i>

43:34.112 --> 43:37.912
The problem is, about every third
Amish man around here is named Lapp.

43:38.282 --> 43:41.035
<i>And we've got upwards
of 14,000 Amish men around here.</i>

43:41.119 --> 43:45.465
<i>- That's just Lancaster County. Over in-
- Very interesting, Sergeant...</i>

43:45.540 --> 43:48.089
but this is a very important matter.

43:48.251 --> 43:51.130
Ýt involves the murder of a police officer.

43:51.504 --> 43:54.929
Now, there must be a directory of some
sort of these people somewhere.

43:55.007 --> 43:59.103
Sure. Tax rolls, voter registration,
but tell you right now...

43:59.178 --> 44:02.227
I don't have the manpower
to send a deputy to every Lapp farm...

44:02.306 --> 44:04.934
<i>in Lancaster County
to see if they've got your Rachel.</i>

44:05.017 --> 44:07.941
Maybe, Sergeant,
you could do a little telephoning?

44:08.020 --> 44:09.738
Yeah, maybe I could.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.655
But since the Amish don't have any
telephones, I wouldn't know who to call.

44:15.653 --> 44:19.703
Thank you, Sergeant.
It's been an education.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.263
Who are they?

44:42.388 --> 44:44.686
The leadership of our district.

44:44.765 --> 44:47.689
They decided to come see you
for themselves.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.445
Except Stoltzfus.

44:49.562 --> 44:51.405
He came the first day.

44:51.564 --> 44:54.738
- I think he saved your life.
- No, that was not I.

44:57.570 --> 45:00.119
- Who else knows I'm here?
- No one.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.868
How long have I been here?

45:03.951 --> 45:05.248
Two days.

45:08.289 --> 45:10.963
Rest, Mr Book, that's the ticket.

45:11.125 --> 45:14.550
And drink my tea, lots of my tea.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.226
Tell him his tea stinks.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.732
You can tell him when you're able.

45:37.109 --> 45:40.409
We're all very happy
that you're going to live, John Book.

45:40.488 --> 45:44.334
We didn't know what we were
going to do with you if you died.

45:54.502 --> 45:57.472
It's not our place
to ask how he came to us.

45:57.964 --> 46:00.342
<i>He'll leave as soon as he's able.</i>

46:39.839 --> 46:41.216
Don't move!

46:43.467 --> 46:45.185
What are you doing?

46:50.891 --> 46:52.017
Come here.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.737
Come here, Samuel. Sit down.

46:57.565 --> 47:01.411
This is a loaded gun.
This is very dangerous.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.867
Never, ever...

47:04.989 --> 47:06.707
touch a loaded gun.

47:07.658 --> 47:12.209
Now I'm taking the bullets out,
now it's safe. Okay?

47:12.747 --> 47:14.499
Okay, Mr Book.

47:15.207 --> 47:17.005
Look, call me John.

47:17.710 --> 47:20.179
I just don't want you to get hurt.

47:20.254 --> 47:23.178
I don't mean to yell at you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

47:23.257 --> 47:27.683
Look, it's all right for you
to look at it now, it's unloaded. It's safe.

47:27.928 --> 47:31.023
You want to handle it,
you can handle it while I'm here...

47:31.098 --> 47:34.648
but that, that's not right.

47:46.072 --> 47:49.417
Samuel, wait for me downstairs.

47:54.121 --> 47:58.126
John Book, while you're in this house,
I insist that you respect our ways.

47:58.250 --> 47:59.422
Right.

48:00.127 --> 48:01.674
Here, take it.

48:02.254 --> 48:05.849
Put it somewhere where it's safe.
Where he won't find it.

48:20.106 --> 48:24.452
This gun of the hand
is for the taking of human life.

48:26.362 --> 48:28.956
We believe it is wrong to take life.

48:30.282 --> 48:32.125
That is only for God.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.839
Many times the wars have come...

48:38.666 --> 48:40.885
and people have said to us...

48:41.043 --> 48:44.343
you must fight, you must kill.

48:44.964 --> 48:47.683
Ýt is the only way to preserve the good.

48:49.802 --> 48:51.224
But, Samuel...

48:53.055 --> 48:56.150
there is never only one way.
Remember that.

48:58.978 --> 49:01.072
Would you kill another man?

49:02.648 --> 49:04.821
I would only kill a bad man.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.037
Only the bad man, I see.

49:10.156 --> 49:12.659
And you know these bad men by sight?

49:13.993 --> 49:17.714
You are able to look into their hearts
and see this badness?

49:19.832 --> 49:21.709
I can see what they do.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.257
I have seen it.

49:25.504 --> 49:29.554
And having seen, you've become
one of them. Don't you understand?

49:32.178 --> 49:34.522
What you take into your hands...

49:36.515 --> 49:38.438
you take into your heart.

49:40.186 --> 49:43.907
"Wherefore come out
from among them...

49:44.190 --> 49:46.067
"and be ye separate...

49:47.067 --> 49:48.694
"saith the Lord...

49:52.031 --> 49:54.409
"and touch not the unclean thing. "

49:57.536 --> 49:59.755
Go and finish your chores now.

49:59.914 --> 50:01.587
Yes, Grandfather.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.893
- Enjoying your reading?
- Oh, yeah.

50:17.890 --> 50:19.984
Learning a lot about manure.

50:20.893 --> 50:22.566
Very interesting.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.777
What's that?

50:30.653 --> 50:32.530
Your clothes are stained with blood.

50:32.613 --> 50:35.366
I have them soaking.
You can wear these.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.712
- They your husband's?
- Yes.

50:41.330 --> 50:44.300
It's good that someone
can have the use of them.

50:44.375 --> 50:47.845
Besides, in your clothes,
you'd stand out to strangers.

50:53.801 --> 50:57.681
I should tell you that this kind of coat
doesn't have buttons.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.057
See?

50:59.139 --> 51:02.234
- Hooks and eyes.
- Something wrong with buttons?

51:02.309 --> 51:04.061
<i>Buttons are hochmut.</i>

51:04.562 --> 51:06.906
Proud, vain, it's not plain.

51:09.191 --> 51:11.410
Got anything against zippers?

51:12.903 --> 51:14.701
You making fun of me?

51:16.323 --> 51:17.370
No.

51:20.494 --> 51:22.167
Like the tourists.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.213
Staring all the time.

51:29.086 --> 51:32.340
Sometimes they come into the yard.
It's very rude.

51:34.258 --> 51:38.604
- They seem to think we're quaint.
- Can't imagine why they'd think that.

51:40.431 --> 51:43.059
Look, is there a phone
somewhere near?

51:45.269 --> 51:47.613
The Gunter's across the valley.

51:47.730 --> 51:50.859
They're Mennonites.
They have cars and refrigerators.

51:50.941 --> 51:54.036
No, I mean a pay phone, a public phone.

51:54.278 --> 51:56.280
The store at Strasburg...

51:56.780 --> 51:59.954
but you won't be going to Strasburg
for a while.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.541
I'm going this morning.

52:03.037 --> 52:06.632
- But Stoltzfus said that you can't-
- Yeah, I know what he said.

52:11.086 --> 52:12.884
You can go with Eli.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.804
He's taking Samuel to school.

52:16.467 --> 52:18.936
- But you'd better hurry.
- Rachel...

52:22.723 --> 52:23.975
Nothing.

52:46.413 --> 52:47.505
What?

52:52.753 --> 52:54.755
Hurry up, John Book.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.929
You'd better get going.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.512
Hurry up, John Book.

53:03.597 --> 53:04.814
MY gun.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.101
I need my gun.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.205
Thanks.

53:26.370 --> 53:27.792
The bullets?

53:28.455 --> 53:30.799
It's not much good without them.

53:31.250 --> 53:32.593
Of course.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.064
Thank you.

53:51.603 --> 53:55.073
How do I look? I mean, do I look Amish?

53:57.818 --> 53:59.365
You look plain.

54:00.654 --> 54:01.746
Okay.

54:42.946 --> 54:44.698
He's an Englishman.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.880
<i>- Carter here.
- Hey, partner, how you doing?</i>

54:58.962 --> 55:01.056
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah.</i>

55:01.381 --> 55:02.507
You?

55:02.591 --> 55:05.970
Listen, man, I'm coming in
to take care of business. How hot am I?

55:06.053 --> 55:07.270
Too hot.

55:07.554 --> 55:09.648
Don't do it. Don't come in.

55:10.140 --> 55:12.814
<i>- They're looking for you.
- And the kid.</i>

55:12.976 --> 55:16.776
<i>- Man, I got to make a move.
- Listen, John, don't do it.</i>

55:17.064 --> 55:20.364
You couldn't get
within a mile of Schaeffer right now.

55:20.442 --> 55:21.910
You hear me?

55:22.402 --> 55:26.248
- Yeah.
- What are we going to do?

55:26.406 --> 55:27.999
FBI? What?

55:28.408 --> 55:29.580
Maybe.

55:30.410 --> 55:32.378
<i>Well, what about
one of those reporters?</i>

55:32.454 --> 55:33.922
<i>Those investigative reporters?</i>

55:34.331 --> 55:37.130
No, it's too risky.
They'd want to talk to the kid.

55:37.292 --> 55:39.761
Listen, I'll make a couple of calls.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.680
Let you know when maybe
you can come in.

55:41.755 --> 55:45.476
- I got to go, take care of yourself.
- Yeah. You, too.

56:18.792 --> 56:19.964
Here.

56:22.963 --> 56:25.182
Don't put them in the peaches.

56:28.552 --> 56:29.974
See this stream?

56:30.637 --> 56:34.187
It goes to the wheel
and it makes the wheel turn around.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.319
And then it goes, it makes...

56:38.520 --> 56:42.150
this wire pump the pump...

56:42.858 --> 56:45.327
over there, into the well...

56:45.652 --> 56:48.997
and the well's water
goes into the house.

56:50.198 --> 56:51.324
Yeah?

56:54.328 --> 56:56.376
This place really echoes.

56:56.830 --> 56:58.002
Hello!

56:59.833 --> 57:01.835
- What's up there?
- Corn.

57:04.171 --> 57:06.549
Would you like to hold my kitten?

57:07.049 --> 57:09.893
I'll show you how to do a back rub
on him.

57:10.510 --> 57:12.387
You hold them like that.

57:12.679 --> 57:16.400
You push their head back,
and you start rubbing the neck.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.033
Is that you, Book?

57:29.112 --> 57:30.705
What you doing there?

57:39.456 --> 57:42.209
Just trying to get the car started,
the battery.

57:42.376 --> 57:44.799
Ýf you are well enough to do that...

57:45.379 --> 57:48.383
- you can do work for me.
- Yeah, what can I do?

57:50.384 --> 57:52.386
- Milking, maybe.
- Milking'?

57:52.886 --> 57:54.888
Cows, you know. Cows.

57:55.889 --> 57:57.891
Yeah, I've seen pictures.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.648
Good. You start tomorrow.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.881
It's 4:30, time for milking.

58:50.819 --> 58:52.366
Milking stool.

58:53.155 --> 58:55.453
Milking hat. There's the milk.

59:04.291 --> 59:08.421
Firm grip.
Pinch the top off and squeeze.

59:10.964 --> 59:13.387
Didn't you hear me? Squeeze.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.514
I am squeezing.

59:16.678 --> 59:19.477
You never had you hands
on a teat before?

59:19.973 --> 59:21.646
Not one this big.

59:31.651 --> 59:34.154
I got it!

59:37.032 --> 59:38.625
I think.

59:44.873 --> 59:47.376
- Come on.
- Gently, gently.

59:48.376 --> 59:50.378
Don't frighten her, Book!

59:52.047 --> 59:54.516
Samuel, help him.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.654
- No, please.
- Eat, Book.

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.448
What's the matter with your appetite?

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.954
I'm not used to eating
in the middle of the night.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.583
Not used to hard work.
That's what makes appetite.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.714
Rachel.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.759
Samuel.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.674
Honey, that's great coffee.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.392
It's a joke.

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:45.943
It's a commercial on television.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.541
- Book, is it?
- Yeah.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:09.420
You are the Yankee they talk about.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.338
I thought I was the English.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.762
English, Yankee, it is the same.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:17.595
My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochleitner.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.930
How do you do?

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:26.520
You look plain, Book. Very plain.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.068
I came to see Rachel.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.688
Eli said I could use his tools.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.241
I'm trying to fix that birdhouse.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:08.543
- I brought you some lemonade.
- Oh, great.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.050
Thanks.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.353
- What happened to Hochleitner?
- He went home.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.403
He's a friend of the family.
He's like a son to Eli.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:42.448
- You know carpentry.
- Yeah.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:46.785
- A bit.
- Can you do anything else?

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.751
Whacking. I'm hell at whacking.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.876
Whacking is not much use on a farm.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.927
Tomorrow I'll let out those trousers
for you.

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.221
Good.

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:22.109
I told Eli that you're a carpenter.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.907
Hold this up closer, will you?

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.701
He said you could come
to Zook's barn raising.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.787
Well, if I'm still here.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.045
<i>Weenie roasts. I don't know anything
about weenie roasts.</i>

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:44.802
<i>That's a West Coast thing. Let's have
some letters on weenie roasts.</i>

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.476
<i>Presenting golden oldies.</i>

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:51.392
<i>We've got some great ones
and some old ones coming right up.</i>

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.974
<i>Here's one, takes me back,
I'm afraid to say it dates me.</i>

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.817
<i>Maybe it dates you.</i>

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:01.652
This is great. This is the best.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:59.289
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.269
Rachel!

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:00.938
Rachel?

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.308
What is it with you?
Is this the Ordnung?

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:36.678
I have done nothing against
the rule of the Ordnung.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.100
Nothing?

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:41.979
You bring this man to our house
with his gun of the hand.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:45.186
You bring fear to this house.

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.524
Fear of English
with guns coming after him-

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:50.992
I've committed no sin.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.820
Maybe. Maybe not yet.

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:56.456
But, Rachel, it does not look...

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:59.329
You know there has been talk.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:03.459
Talk about going to the Bishop
and having you shunned.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:05.214
That is idle talk.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.675
Do not take it lightly. Rachel!

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:10.504
They can do it.

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:13.677
They can do it just like that.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:18.011
You know what it means, shunning?

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.732
I cannot sit at table with you.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:25.856
I cannot take a thing from your hand.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.529
I cannot go to worship with you.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.192
Child...

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.032
do not go so far.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.328
- I am not a child.
- But you are acting like one.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.705
- I'll be the judge of that.
- No.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.872
They will be the judge of that,
and so will I.

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:51.045
- If you shame me...
- You shame yourself.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:04.390
Why don't you tell me where he is?

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:06.768
You know, don't you?

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.444
I just want to talk to him.

01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:17.404
I wanna talk some sense into him.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.911
You know, we go way back.

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:24.368
John and I were a team once.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.788
Like you two are now.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:31.960
I trained him.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.964
He's a fine policeman.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.022
I know he's with the Amish.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.978
God, I'd give anything to see him now.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.033
Can you see John at a prayer meeting?

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.462
We're like the Amish.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.796
We're a cult, too.

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:16.967
A club. With our own rules.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.227
John has broken those rules.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.518
As you're breaking them now.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.011
I hear you're a carpenter.

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:08.348
Well, it's been a while.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:11.025
No matter,
we can always use a good one.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:15.568
Hurry up now. We have a barn to raise
and a day to do it.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:25.873
Good luck.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.204
Your hole is better now?

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:33.039
Yeah, it's pretty much healed.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.714
Good, then you can go home.

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:53.225
Yes, sir.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:00.996
Everyone has an idea
about you and the Englishman, Book.

01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:04.204
All of them charitable, I'm sure.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:07.002
Hardly any of them.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.151
Amos.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:33.741
This is Lidia and Amos.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.068
- John Book.
- Hello.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.079
- Hello.
- It's their barn you built today.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.248
- We just got married.
- Yeah?

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.585
That's great.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:32.081
Rachel?

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.392
Rachel.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.444
Ýf we'd made love last night,
I'd have to stay.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.452
Or you'd have to leave.

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:29.468
Get off the bus, everybody!

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:32.096
Welcome to Amish country.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:36.476
This is the most famous Amish
grocery store in the area.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:38.815
Now, stay close together...

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.738
because we're only going to be here
another 15 minutes.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:44.988
Now, be careful with photographing
the Amish, they don't like it...

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.616
but you can sneak one now and then.

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:49.621
All right, stay together.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.824
Young man!

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:55.499
Hello, we're just here for the day,
would you mind if I took your picture?

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.671
Now just stand still. Fix your hat a little-

01:21:57.788 --> 01:22:00.758
Lady, you take my picture,
I'm going to rip your brassiere off...

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:03.177
and strangle you with it.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.677
You got that?

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:10.635
Did you hear
what that Amish just said to me?

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:14.312
- Homicide.
- Elton Carter.

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:17.558
<i>- Who's calling?
- A mend.</i>

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:23.648
<i>Yeah, Salazar, Public Relations.
Can I help you?</i>

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:27.493
Yeah, I'm trying to reach
Sgt Elton Carter.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.195
<i>Are you a member of the family?</i>

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.493
What? No, I'm a friend.

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:36.877
<i>Then I regret to inform you
Sgt Carter is dead.</i>

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.078
What?

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:40.790
<i>He died last night,
killed in the line of duty.</i>

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.001
<i>Should you require other-</i>

01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:10.110
Hello. Yes.

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.446
Paul!

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:18.126
It's John Book.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.292
I'll take it in the study.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.377
How are you, John?

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.432
Hello, John.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:44.942
Calling me at home, I can't trace
the call. That's smart, John, very smart.

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:47.690
- Lost the meaning, didn't you, Paul?
- What?

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:51.402
<i>Isn't that what you used to say
about dirty cops?</i>

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:54.868
<i>Somewhere along the way,
they lost the meaning.</i>

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:58.827
Don't make it difficult, John.
We know where you are.

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:01.458
- We're about to-
- No, you got it wrong, man.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:05.003
- I'm coming to get you.
- I like your style, John.

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:07.376
I've always liked your style.

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:10.050
I'm going to do to you
whatever you did to Zenovich...

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:11.721
and whatever you did to Carter.

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:14.926
I'm going to fucking do that to you, too,
you asshole.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:33.327
Come on, you wrecked the fucking road.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.746
- I can't take this up.
- Yeah.

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:37.739
- Just give it a shot.
- Look.

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:40.788
- No look. You look.
- It takes half hour to take back.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.300
Ýt happens sometimes. Do nothing.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.589
I asked you to move this horse.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:55.431
Come on!

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.176
Come on, Goldilocks.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:02.440
- Don't you speak English?
- You don't hear very good, do you?

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:13.576
- And the chin.
- You look better, buddy.

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:19.160
- Come on down, Jack.
- They are not allowed to fight.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.331
You a man or what?

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:24.128
That's right, no fighting.
They won't fight for their country either.

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:27.547
- Ýt's not our way.
- But it's my way.

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:29.963
Book, no!

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:33.216
- How does it look?
- It looks great, give it to me.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:39.594
Here comes another one, look at this.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.812
It's all right, Book.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.275
Watch it, Frankie,
he's gonna hit you with his Bible.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.981
You're making a mistake.

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:10.673
Book.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.721
Somebody give me a handkerchief,
he's bleeding.

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:34.277
I've never seen anything like it
in all my years.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.484
He is from Ohio, my cousin.

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:40.196
Well, then, them Ohio Amish
must be different.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:44.746
Round here, the brethren don't have
anything like that kind of fight in them.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:46.790
Good day to you, Mr Lapp.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.337
This ain't good for the tourist trade,
you know.

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:51.632
Tell that to your Ohio friend.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.593
Broke his nose.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:57.888
He was with old Eli Lapp.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.899
Where did you get that?

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:14.904
Book gave it to me.

01:27:17.315 --> 01:27:19.738
He said it was a special present.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:42.349
Samuel, time for bed.

01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:49.940
You can take the toy with you.

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.419
He's leaving, isn't he?

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.297
Tomorrow morning.

01:28:18.877 --> 01:28:21.972
- He'll need his city clothes.
- But why?

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.304
What's he going back to? Nothing?

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:29.308
He's going back to his world,
where he belongs.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.640
He knows it...

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.310
and you know it, too.

01:32:50.982 --> 01:32:53.656
It's all right, we're police officers.

01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:56.325
Check the rest of the house.

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:59.707
It's all right, we're police officers.

01:33:00.742 --> 01:33:04.337
Philadelphia Police.
It's all right, Mrs Lapp.

01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:08.876
Why don't you sit down.
It's going to be all right.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:12.672
We're not going to harm your boy.
It's Book we want.

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:16.174
Now, where is he?

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:30.439
Book!

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:36.702
Fergie! Come on!

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.114
Come on, damn it.

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:54.049
What is it? What are they doing?

01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:11.901
Listen, Samuel,
I want you to go to Hochleitner's farm...

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.449
as fast as you can and stay there.
You understand me?

01:34:14.566 --> 01:34:16.694
- Are they going to kill you?
- I'll be all right.

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:18.904
But you don't have your gun.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.499
Run, Samuel. Run!

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:45.476
Shit!

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:07.035
Come on!

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:39.659
Samuel!

01:39:25.751 --> 01:39:26.877
Fergie?

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:35.891
Fuck!

01:39:43.728 --> 01:39:44.900
McFee!

01:39:58.743 --> 01:39:59.915
Fergie!

01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:19.104
What's wrong?

01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:21.937
- I can't figure it out.
- Where's Fergie?

01:40:22.058 --> 01:40:24.652
I don't know, you'd better come on up.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.133
Come on, we're going outside.

01:41:07.144 --> 01:41:08.145
Come on!

01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:00.873
Schaeffer!

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:33.239
Stop the boy ringing that bell.

01:42:34.106 --> 01:42:36.859
I want you to stop the boy ringing that
bell. I want you to... Stop him now!

01:42:36.942 --> 01:42:38.694
Get out of here now!

01:42:47.703 --> 01:42:48.750
Let her go, Paul!

01:42:48.871 --> 01:42:51.340
- Put the gun down, Book!
- Let her go, Schaeffer!

01:42:51.415 --> 01:42:53.759
- I'll blow you away.
- Put that gun down.

01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:55.795
I'm gonna blow her head off!

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.593
It's down, the fucking gun is down!

01:42:57.713 --> 01:43:01.058
- You really fucked up now, you idiot!
- Let her go.

01:43:01.133 --> 01:43:02.760
Let her go, Paul. The gun's down!

01:43:02.885 --> 01:43:06.105
- Book, put that gun down!
- The gun's down!

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:09.400
It's down. Don't hurt her.

01:43:44.135 --> 01:43:47.309
It's all right, Rachel.

01:43:47.596 --> 01:43:49.644
Rachel, just go. Go.

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:02.657
It's all right! I'm a police officer!

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.948
The man's wanted for murder.

01:44:05.114 --> 01:44:07.492
- Now stand back!
- What are you going to do, Paul?

01:44:07.616 --> 01:44:09.584
You going to kill me?
You going to shoot me'?

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.879
- You going to shoot him?
- Stand back!

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:14.875
You going to shoot him?
Is that what you're going to do, Paul?

01:44:14.999 --> 01:44:16.672
Him, the woman, me?

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.684
It's over! Enough!

01:46:22.084 --> 01:46:23.802
Goodbye, John Book.

01:46:28.132 --> 01:46:29.634
Goodbye, Samuel.

01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:25.124
You be careful out among them English.
