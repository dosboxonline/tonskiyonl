because so much has been lost.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.050
But every single one
that mentions Lanfear agrees

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.630
that she loved
the Dragon Reborn.

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.090
And that he loved her,

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.510
before he met his wife.

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:04.060
But she was a Darkfriend.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.990
Only after he broke her heart.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.160
She swore her oaths to the Dark
to try to get him back.

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:18.900
And, what, you want
to make her think she has?

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.070
You want me to pretend
to be in love with a Forsaken?

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.200
Lanfear is working
with Ishamael.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.120
This could be our only chance
to find out what he wants.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.660
- She'll see right through it.
- Maybe.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.180
Maybe. She might.

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:32.480
I don't know.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.150
Whatever she is, I don't think
everything between us was a lie.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.400
It's your choice, Rand.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.820
I mean that this time.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.670
I'll stay here.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.680
If it seems
as if she's hurting you...

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.100
...I'll wake you.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.870
And if you fall asleep?

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:11.870
You're exhausted.

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:13.850
I don't have that option.
