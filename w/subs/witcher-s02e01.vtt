Colin!

Colin, where is everybody?

00:45.958 --> 00:46.958
Hello?

00:47.791 --> 00:49.250
[bucket continues banging]

00:50.750 --> 00:51.583
Hello?

00:52.333 --> 00:54.750
I'm in need of lodgings for the night!

00:54.833 --> 00:55.958
I'm a merchant.

00:56.541 --> 00:57.500
I can pay.

01:00.333 --> 01:01.291
Hello?

01:03.791 --> 01:05.125

-Not today.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.375
Please have mercy--

02:24.083 --> 02:25.916
Take him. Leave me be.

5,000 dead Kaedwenians,

03:11.083 --> 03:13.416
and at least 20,000 of theirs.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.333
You won't find her in your visions.

03:23.625 --> 03:24.958
She's gone.

03:33.458 --> 03:34.291
Yennefer?

03:37.791 --> 03:38.708
Yennefer…

03:41.208 --> 03:43.750
Yennefer!

[Geralt] Yennefer!

03:49.041 --> 03:50.791
[Roach whickers]

04:05.166 --> 04:06.208
I've seen this.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.500
Stay on the horse.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.333
Where is she?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.041
And who are you to her, exactly?

04:24.125 --> 04:25.250
Is she alive?

04:34.666 --> 04:36.583
We won. Because of her.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.000
She bought us time
until the armies arrived.

04:47.208 --> 04:48.208
Was it worth it?

05:00.833 --> 05:02.041

Yennefer.

05:14.791 --> 05:16.833
Can you please tell me who she is?

05:16.916 --> 05:17.875
Doesn't matter.

05:19.583 --> 05:20.625
She's gone now.

05:50.708 --> 05:52.125
[Ciri shivering]

05:52.208 --> 05:53.125
Let me go.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
Let me go!

[whimpering]

06:00.166 --> 06:02.166
[wind whistling]

06:16.208 --> 06:17.541
I sleep like shit too.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.000
You don't sleep at all.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.541
Makes for fewer nightmares.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.583
Except for the one about the rock troll.

06:30.666 --> 06:31.750
Overly friendly.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.833
Tough image to shake.

06:40.833 --> 06:41.833
What about yours?

06:50.583 --> 06:52.791
The Black Knight has me on his horse…

06:56.208 --> 06:57.708
Cintra is burning.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.375
I'm too helpless to stop any of it.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.708
You escaped.

07:10.416 --> 07:11.458
I was lucky.

07:21.958 --> 07:24.916
I… need to understand some things.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.166
You claimed the Law of Surprise
and got me.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.583
Why?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.666
It was payment for a debt.

07:32.375 --> 07:33.791
I saved your father's life.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.458
-From what?
-Your grandmother.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.208
She didn't want your mother marrying a…

07:41.916 --> 07:42.958
an outsider.

07:51.833 --> 07:54.083
Your father didn't know
what he was giving up.

08:01.666 --> 08:02.500
So…

08:03.875 --> 08:05.000
I'm your destiny.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.916
-Whatever that means.
-You're much more than that, Cirilla.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.833
-I miss my home.
-Cintra isn't safe for you any more.

08:25.041 --> 08:28.125
Then what about Skellige?
I have people there too.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.750
-I'd be safe there.
-If you want.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.541
But you'd be married off
to the nearest Lord of Bad Breath.

08:35.666 --> 08:37.916
He'd be seeking to claim your throne too.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.875
The food is good there, though.

08:47.666 --> 08:49.500

09:06.708 --> 09:08.166
-[man] Quickly!
-[woman] Over here!

09:10.000 --> 09:11.666
[man] I'm the only fuck in here!

09:13.708 --> 09:15.750
[yelling]

09:17.041 --> 09:18.041
[Artorius] Triss!

09:18.125 --> 09:20.125
-[Triss groaning]
-[Artorius] Stay with us!

09:20.625 --> 09:22.541
-[thunder crashes]
-Stay with us!

09:23.875 --> 09:26.250
-Triss!
-[moaning and sobbing]

09:26.333 --> 09:28.125
She was stable.
I don't know what happened.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.541
[grunting]

09:31.250 --> 09:32.833

-[rumbling]

09:35.250 --> 09:37.083
-We're losing her.
-[gasping]

[both speaking in Elder]

09:40.791 --> 09:42.250

09:50.208 --> 09:51.750
Mmm. [gasps]

[thunder rumbling]

09:55.250 --> 09:56.958
[men groaning]

10:03.583 --> 10:05.833
-What is it?
-There is no sign of Yennefer.

10:07.375 --> 10:08.666
She's lost for good.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.250
And what of my niece?

10:12.333 --> 10:13.750
Fringilla was at the front.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.416
Coordinating the Nilfgaardian attack
with the prisoner we took.

10:18.916 --> 10:22.500
She has abandoned all rules of Chaos.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.875
She is lost too, then.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.583
Familial disgrace can wait.

10:28.083 --> 10:30.041
We need intelligence
from that prisoner now.

10:30.916 --> 10:34.625
The kings have their blood up.
They want to chase Nilfgaard south.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.458
Perhaps we should, since
you'd have us be warriors in the field

10:37.541 --> 10:40.958
-instead of advisers in the palace.
-You weren't there, Artorius.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.041
We won. But barely.

10:43.666 --> 10:46.500
We do not know the troops
that Nilfgaard have in reserve,

10:46.583 --> 10:48.916
where they are reassembling,
what they are planning next.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.916
[sighs] The prisoner.

10:53.750 --> 10:54.875
What do we know?

10:54.958 --> 10:56.708
Our spies don't have much.

10:56.791 --> 10:59.250
Only that he orchestrated
the fall of Cintra.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.958
And that he doesn't answer to
the generals, only to the emperor himself.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.708
No one's been able to break him.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.000
He will give us everything we need…

11:08.958 --> 11:10.416
if I can have time with him.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.041
We have rules.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.333
She wasn't asking your permission.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.708
[gasps]

11:45.166 --> 11:47.041
-[muffled] She's awake.
-[gasps]

11:52.458 --> 11:54.500
-[muffled] Welcome back.
-[Yennefer sighs]

11:54.583 --> 11:55.916
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.333
[grunts]

12:07.916 --> 12:08.875
Fuck.

12:14.541 --> 12:16.541
[birdsong]

12:18.333 --> 12:20.333
[Ciri] So, what exactly is Kaer Morhen?

12:21.958 --> 12:24.375
[Geralt] It's where witchers go
during the winter.

12:24.875 --> 12:28.708
There, we can rest up and heal.
Replace armor and elixirs.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.333
It's my home.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.791
How come I've never heard of it?

12:35.291 --> 12:36.916
Because we like it that way.

12:37.916 --> 12:38.750
Why?

12:41.458 --> 12:42.666
There was an attack.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.166
A long time ago, when I was a boy.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.625
Almost wiped us all out.

12:49.916 --> 12:51.916
So now, we like to keep a low profile.

12:53.416 --> 12:54.250
[Ciri] Hmm.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.750
In Cintra, I used to dress up like a boy
just so I could play knucklebones.

12:57.833 --> 12:58.791
[chuckles]

12:59.916 --> 13:01.916
We both need
to keep a low profile, it seems.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.875
[Roach snorts]

13:06.416 --> 13:08.541
Were you attacked
because you're different?

13:12.666 --> 13:16.083
Sure. We can't see the future
like you can.

13:20.208 --> 13:25.125
Back on the battlefield, when you saw me
and that woman before it happened.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.916
Yes, well, it was…
it was more like a dream.

13:33.791 --> 13:34.875
Hazy. It was…

13:35.833 --> 13:36.666
it was weird.

13:42.916 --> 13:44.166
[neighs]

13:48.166 --> 13:49.291
[snorts]

14:04.500 --> 14:07.625

14:08.916 --> 14:09.875
Easy.

-[neighs]
-[whooshing]

14:15.875 --> 14:17.083
How did you do that?

14:17.166 --> 14:18.500
It's called axii.

14:19.375 --> 14:20.666
It's a calming sign.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.000
Magic. Like… like a druid?

14:24.583 --> 14:25.583
Not really.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.375
[draws knife]

14:46.916 --> 14:48.000

[screeching sound]

14:53.833 --> 14:55.416

15:01.583 --> 15:03.000
We should keep moving.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.083
[wind whistling]

15:12.291 --> 15:13.416
Oh, thank gods.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.625
Think there's an inn?

15:18.583 --> 15:19.666
Hmm.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.083
-Come on, Roach.

[Geralt inhales]

15:32.958 --> 15:33.791
What is it?

15:34.458 --> 15:35.958
[Geralt] There are no guards.

15:37.208 --> 15:38.791
-[Ciri] Maybe hiding--
-[Geralt] Quiet.

15:39.666 --> 15:41.208
[bucket continues banging]

15:41.791 --> 15:43.625
There are no barking dogs, either.

15:45.166 --> 15:46.625
This place never sleeps.

15:49.791 --> 15:52.958
-So what now?
-I know somewhere nearby. An old friend.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.208
[animal shrieks]

16:01.458 --> 16:03.000
[animal shrieks]

16:11.291 --> 16:12.791
[Roach snorts]

16:22.750 --> 16:23.916
Stay on Roach.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.375
[crashing, men yelling]

16:34.041 --> 16:35.416

-[mutters]

16:57.625 --> 16:58.625
Geralt!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.083
Nivellen?

17:02.166 --> 17:04.500
What the fuck are you doing here,
you old whoreson?

17:05.916 --> 17:07.375
This is your friend?

17:07.458 --> 17:08.458
[Geralt] Yeah…

17:09.750 --> 17:11.791
-But he's changed.
-[Nivellen] I know.

17:12.375 --> 17:14.916
I look a tad different
since you saw me last.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.000
But I could say the same of you.

17:20.083 --> 17:23.500
Put away your knife
and come in out of the cold, Witcher.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.583
I'll tell you everything.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.041
Eh?

17:29.916 --> 17:30.958
[chuckles]

17:32.875 --> 17:34.500
A fire for my guests.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.750
And you, my dear…

17:38.541 --> 17:39.500
Ciri.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.416
Well, Ciri, what say you to a hot bath

17:42.500 --> 17:44.666
to warm your frozen bones?

17:44.750 --> 17:46.041
Oh, I'd love one.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.791
-We're only staying until the storm dies.
-Please.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.208
[Nivellen] Splendid.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.208
Bath!

17:53.083 --> 17:54.333
[laughs]

17:55.750 --> 17:56.875
[gasps]

17:56.958 --> 17:59.166
[Nivellen] You can bathe in the next room.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.250
I'm fine.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.958
You, my friend, are very far from fine.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.125
You reek of old horse.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.750
Part of my charm.

18:06.833 --> 18:09.375
You always were a horse's arse, anyway.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.833
Doors!

18:13.375 --> 18:16.458
How long's it been?
13 winters since we last saw each other?

18:16.541 --> 18:19.583
Nivellen, I'm not one
to slight the rite of hospitality,

18:20.666 --> 18:22.916
but I do need to know
that she's safe here.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.083
You see my tusks and think I would…
bite the throat?

18:29.416 --> 18:31.416
Hmm. She is.

18:33.541 --> 18:34.541
I'm still me.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.208
Well… Lights!

18:37.791 --> 18:40.291
-[laughs]
-That's not a bad trick.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.208
You gonna tell me what happened to you?

18:43.291 --> 18:45.916
That's a tale requiring wine. What of you?

18:46.666 --> 18:48.666
That's a tale requiring a wine cellar.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.750
[Nivellen laughs]

18:52.291 --> 18:53.375
[chuckles]

18:57.333 --> 18:58.875
[light skittering sounds]

19:00.000 --> 19:01.708
-[creaking]
-[soft warbling]

19:04.708 --> 19:07.625
-[pattering and cooing]
-[Ciri gasps]

19:09.166 --> 19:11.250
[scratching]

19:30.916 --> 19:32.916
[creaking and tapping]

19:36.916 --> 19:38.666
[cooing]

19:39.333 --> 19:43.000
[Nivellen] Numbskull took one look
at the place, tucked tail and ran so fast,

19:43.083 --> 19:44.750
his feet didn't touch the ground.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.291
Brigands were tougher in our days, eh?
[chuckles]

19:49.375 --> 19:51.458
[Ciri] Thank you so much for this.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.041
My other clothes were ready
to run away by themselves.

19:56.375 --> 19:57.875
But of course. Uh…

19:59.125 --> 20:00.208
You look lovely.

20:04.708 --> 20:06.500
[ringing sound]

20:06.583 --> 20:08.500
Roast venison, sage truffles,

20:08.583 --> 20:10.500
sweet wine, and lots of it!

20:11.458 --> 20:12.458
And for you,

20:13.125 --> 20:14.458
only the best.

20:14.541 --> 20:15.916
Witchers' quail.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.416
[laughs]

20:20.916 --> 20:22.041
That's a good one.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.500
[Nivellen] I jest, I jest!

20:23.583 --> 20:25.875
Mountain pheasant for my friend!

20:25.958 --> 20:28.291
[laughs

20:29.250 --> 20:30.083
Ah!

20:33.916 --> 20:36.291
-Very good, eh?
-Mmm, very good indeed.

20:37.166 --> 20:40.000
-Has he told you how we first met?
-No.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.250
He's not especially chatty.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.458
-[Nivellen] No.
-[Ciri] I'd like to hear, though.

20:44.541 --> 20:48.750
It's my favorite tale.
You see, this snow-capped sourpuss here

20:49.416 --> 20:52.208
was hired
by the most horrible monster of all,

20:52.750 --> 20:53.875
my father,

20:53.958 --> 20:56.458
to clear our woods
of a wyvern infestation.

20:56.541 --> 20:59.375
-I've seen those in books.
-[Nivellen] Horrid creatures.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.250
See that weak young whelp of a lad?

21:02.625 --> 21:03.916
That was me.

21:04.875 --> 21:07.375
And I tried to prove myself to my father

21:08.166 --> 21:09.458
by killing one first.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.250
But instead… [chuckles]

21:12.333 --> 21:14.833
…I fell into the damned beast's lair.

21:14.916 --> 21:17.833
This one pulls me up
by the scruff of my neck

21:17.916 --> 21:20.750
and slays the wyvern
snapping at my nethers.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.000
What do you think he does next?

21:25.375 --> 21:26.208
What?

21:26.291 --> 21:29.416
Gives me a hiding
for being such a cretinous twit? No.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.750
He hands me the wyvern's head

21:34.166 --> 21:37.291
and tells my father
I was the one that killed it.

21:42.708 --> 21:44.958
I had to clear the forest
of the entire pack.

21:45.041 --> 21:48.500
-Got paid either way.
-Nonsense! He's a big softie.

21:48.583 --> 21:51.125
I tell you no word of a lie, young Ciri.

21:51.833 --> 21:54.125
It was the first and last time…

21:55.083 --> 21:57.125
[sighs] …I saw my father proud of me.

21:58.375 --> 21:59.333
After that,

22:00.208 --> 22:04.083
Geralt and I became friends,
of a sort, over many a summer.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.875
Since we're telling no lies,
tell us about your curse.

22:08.791 --> 22:12.041
-In front of the girl?
-She's tougher than you think.

22:20.666 --> 22:23.625
[sighs] I was a gormless young twat.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.375
That's how.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.625
Fell in with a bad lot.

22:30.291 --> 22:32.500
I trashed
the Temple of the Lionheaded Spider.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.250
High on godflesh mushrooms.

22:34.333 --> 22:37.291
All the mushrooms in the world
wouldn't make anyone that stupid.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.958
[Nivellen] If only it was so.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.041
After the damage was done,

22:43.625 --> 22:46.958
this priestess cursed me
to live like this.

22:48.041 --> 22:48.916
Forever.

22:49.583 --> 22:50.500
Alone.

22:53.083 --> 22:54.041
Hmm.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.833
All curses have cures. What did she say?

23:00.083 --> 23:02.083
She screamed something about

23:02.958 --> 23:04.000
love and blood.

23:05.625 --> 23:06.750
I don't remember.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.166
I'll be honest.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.000
I've tried to end it, Geralt.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.250
More than once.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.291
But I kept coming back.

23:24.208 --> 23:26.666
That priestess won't let me off so easy.

23:32.583 --> 23:33.791
[sighs]

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
The village below was abandoned.

23:39.583 --> 23:40.833
What happened there?

23:41.833 --> 23:43.541
After the Battle of Sodden, the…

23:44.125 --> 23:46.375
countryside is a dangerous place.

23:46.875 --> 23:49.083
Hungry soldiers, deserters…

23:50.125 --> 23:53.166
Not reason enough for an entire village
to leave their homes.

23:54.666 --> 23:55.666
It is…

23:56.166 --> 23:58.791
when the Wild Hunt's
riding over the horizon.

23:59.958 --> 24:01.208
I saw them myself.

24:01.916 --> 24:02.833
Just last week.

24:03.791 --> 24:06.666
Riding their skeletal horses
across the southern sky.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.750
A portent of doom.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.000
The Wraiths of Mörhogg?

24:11.666 --> 24:13.833
My grandfather saw them
just before Cintra fell.

24:13.916 --> 24:15.291
Her grandfather was a drunk.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.250
He saw a lot of things.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.666
I'm simply saying,
the North and South at war,

24:23.750 --> 24:26.333
monsters roaming
when they should be hibernating,

24:26.416 --> 24:28.458
pestilence sweeping the land…

24:29.166 --> 24:31.000
Maybe it's the end of days.

24:31.083 --> 24:34.416
I've lived through a whole dark age
and three supposed end of days.

24:35.166 --> 24:36.291
It's all horseshit.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.166
No, something has changed, Geralt.

24:39.916 --> 24:43.000
The world's acting
of its own strange accord these days.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.791
-[scritching]
-Far outside the reach of kings and men.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.708
[scratching and cooing]

24:48.958 --> 24:50.708
[Ciri] Nivellen, do you have a cat?

24:51.333 --> 24:53.416
The poor thing
might be stuck in the ceiling.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.958
I do, in fact. She's fine.

24:56.875 --> 24:58.500
Vereena, she's called.

24:59.375 --> 25:01.250
I'm very glad of her company,

25:01.333 --> 25:03.375
even if she's a shy wee thing.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.583
Not fond of strangers.

25:06.708 --> 25:09.125
Didn't you say
you were cursed to live alone?

25:09.833 --> 25:12.083
Didn't you say
cats are afraid of witchers?

25:14.333 --> 25:15.333
How about a show?

25:15.416 --> 25:18.833
How about we scout the property?
Make sure it's secure for the night.

25:18.916 --> 25:20.875
-Ugh!
-[Ciri] Go on, Geralt.

25:21.916 --> 25:23.041
We'll be all right.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.250
[wind gusting]

25:32.291 --> 25:33.583
[door opens]

25:36.625 --> 25:38.125
What a welcome sight.

25:38.708 --> 25:39.958
[spits]

25:44.041 --> 25:46.750
Are you my inquisitor or executioner?

25:49.125 --> 25:50.875
See where the night takes us.

25:51.708 --> 25:52.708
[scoffs]

25:59.208 --> 26:00.583
Do what you will.

26:03.458 --> 26:04.875
Make no difference in the end.

26:07.791 --> 26:09.916
The White Flame will cleanse us all.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.291
-[screeching sound]
-[screams]

26:17.125 --> 26:19.125
[moaning]

26:20.541 --> 26:21.625
[coughing]

26:22.291 --> 26:24.708
I need to know what Nilfgaard wants.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.125
[grunts and coughs]

26:29.541 --> 26:31.291
Resist or submit.

26:31.916 --> 26:33.416
It makes no difference.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.000
[Cahir coughing]

26:35.791 --> 26:37.000
[whimpering]

26:38.583 --> 26:40.375
[Tissaia] 'Tis not in my nature…

26:41.333 --> 26:42.666
to be cruel.

26:43.833 --> 26:47.250
But you have taken someone from me.

26:48.416 --> 26:50.250
Someone I care about deeply.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.458
[shudders]

26:52.791 --> 26:56.083
So now I will take your knowledge…

26:56.166 --> 26:58.125
-[gasps]
-…your memories,

26:59.250 --> 27:00.625
your very being,

27:01.791 --> 27:03.791
and leave you cold and helpless,

27:03.875 --> 27:07.125
trapped in the eternal darkness
of your own mind.

27:10.583 --> 27:11.500
I know.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.625
I know you want to scream.

27:15.833 --> 27:17.958
-[whispers] But it's too soon.
-[shivering]

27:18.041 --> 27:21.125
It's too soon
because I haven't even started yet.

27:21.208 --> 27:22.958
-[crunching and shrieking]
-[gasps]

27:23.041 --> 27:27.041
If evolution has traced
any groove at all in your brain,

27:27.666 --> 27:29.916
-I will plough it somewhat deeper.
-[crunch]

27:30.000 --> 27:32.875
And then you will know
what a scream can really be!

27:32.958 --> 27:34.958
-[screams]
-[high-pitched ringing]

27:41.208 --> 27:42.416
[bird calls]

27:42.500 --> 27:43.541
[Yennefer groans]

27:46.625 --> 27:48.666
This the best you can conjure up?

27:51.166 --> 27:53.583
The battle
must have really taken it out of you.

27:54.666 --> 27:57.791
Unlike you, I'm not one
to waste Chaos on frivolous nonsense.

27:57.875 --> 28:00.875
I wouldn't call
burning half your forces frivolous.

28:02.125 --> 28:05.000
Pity you're in dimeritium chains
behind enemy lines, then.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.833
Or else you could
conjure us up a boar to eat.

28:10.708 --> 28:12.125
[man grunting]

28:13.208 --> 28:14.458
[groaning]

28:21.583 --> 28:22.666
You're on the run.

28:23.750 --> 28:26.791
-We won.
-A battle. The war's just begun.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.250
The refrain of the defeated, how sad.

28:29.333 --> 28:32.000
Sodden was merely a raindrop
before the storm.

28:32.458 --> 28:33.458
Look at you.

28:34.666 --> 28:37.416
-Why are you doing this?
-Because I'm loyal to my kingdom.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.958
No, your precious leader's
after something.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.166
You're a pawn to get to it.

28:42.958 --> 28:45.291
I can't imagine… What's his name, Emhyr?

28:46.208 --> 28:49.958
My humble apologies,
the mighty White Flame himself…

28:50.541 --> 28:54.541
Can't imagine he'll be too happy
to see you return, tail between your legs.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.583
You know I won't turn.

28:59.791 --> 29:02.750
-That the Brotherhood won't negotiate.
-They won't want you back.

29:03.250 --> 29:05.958
You've broken their sacred law,
tapped into fire magic.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.250
-At Tissaia's behest.
-Oh!

29:07.333 --> 29:08.708
I'll be lauded for saving them.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.166
I'm sure they'll be most understanding.
All leaders are.

29:16.291 --> 29:17.958
You're offering me up as a sacrifice.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.958
A bloody mea culpa for fucking up
Nilfgaard's great push north.

29:28.791 --> 29:31.875
At least conjure me up some decent food
before we get to Shitgaard.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.458
[whooshing]

29:37.125 --> 29:39.166
This is what you do
to keep yourself entertained?

29:39.250 --> 29:41.416
To keep myself sane, yes.

29:44.958 --> 29:46.375
It's a famous piece

29:47.083 --> 29:50.833
I first saw as a lad
whilst studying at Oxenfurt.

29:51.625 --> 29:52.791
Aah!

29:53.958 --> 29:57.375
It tells the tale
of a doomed young Elven warrior

29:58.041 --> 30:00.208
and a human she falls in love with.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.458
What's it called?

30:02.958 --> 30:05.083
The Fall of the Elders.

30:08.291 --> 30:11.125
Elven warrior, human mage

30:11.208 --> 30:13.083
Ordained by hate to kill

30:13.750 --> 30:16.333
Instead found love and ran away

30:16.416 --> 30:18.250
Against their people's will

30:21.416 --> 30:22.625
It's beautiful.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.375
[chuckles]

30:25.583 --> 30:27.708
Into bliss, the two did wed

30:28.208 --> 30:29.541
A baby on the way

30:30.708 --> 30:32.833
A child born to parents dead

30:33.750 --> 30:36.333
That fateful winter's day

30:36.416 --> 30:38.416
[faint screeching]

30:39.541 --> 30:42.333
-[Roach whickers]
-It's as if she's determined

30:42.416 --> 30:45.083
to do the opposite
of the thing that'll keep her safe.

30:47.083 --> 30:49.750
Verbose when I need her to be quiet.
[sighs]

30:49.833 --> 30:52.458
Stubborn and sullen
when I need her to talk.

30:55.166 --> 30:57.000
Looks like you're in good company.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.375
You remind me of an old friend.

31:02.958 --> 31:03.833
Mousesack.

31:08.041 --> 31:09.916
Sometimes it doesn't seem real.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.166
That he's gone.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.291
And I just--

31:16.958 --> 31:19.375
I wish
I could go back in time and save him.

31:20.041 --> 31:21.083
Save everyone.

31:21.791 --> 31:23.041
Can I come with you?

31:23.791 --> 31:27.166
I have a few things
I should like to change myself. [chuckles]

31:30.125 --> 31:31.125
What's it like?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.791
Being alone because of what you are?

31:38.375 --> 31:40.208
It's what eats you alive.

31:41.416 --> 31:42.541
Loneliness.

31:43.583 --> 31:44.875
[Nivellen sighs]

31:51.041 --> 31:53.291
Have… have you ever tried
to cure yourself?

31:53.833 --> 31:56.958
Oh, I've plied many a lass
with treasure to kiss me,

31:57.041 --> 32:00.250
hoping there was a grain of truth
to those fairy tales.

32:00.333 --> 32:02.666
Maybe you just haven't
found the right one yet.

32:03.333 --> 32:06.750
Mousesack told me of a hedgehog man
who was cured by true love.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.458
Lucky chap.

32:09.541 --> 32:10.958
He was probably worthy.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.708
You saw my statue garden.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.416
All my servants are buried there.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.875
I killed them the day I turned,

32:23.583 --> 32:25.333
not knowing what I was,

32:25.416 --> 32:27.291
not knowing my own strength.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.916
I deserve my destiny.

32:36.208 --> 32:37.083
Come.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.291
I'm being a bore.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.250
And you must be tired.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.375
[chuckles]

32:53.208 --> 32:54.500
[Nivellen] Here we are.

32:58.875 --> 33:00.041
It's been a treat.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.458
Those people you killed…

33:09.208 --> 33:10.375
you didn't mean to.

33:15.666 --> 33:17.000
[chuckles]

33:18.083 --> 33:19.083
Sometimes…

33:19.791 --> 33:21.541
I think I'm still a man.

33:22.666 --> 33:23.708
But mostly…

33:24.750 --> 33:26.416
I know what I really am.

33:31.958 --> 33:34.375
I watched my entire home

33:35.625 --> 33:38.125
burn to the ground
at the hands of another.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.333
My family trapped inside.

33:46.541 --> 33:48.458
You don't seem like a monster to me.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.791
I appreciate that, my dear.

33:52.958 --> 33:55.208
Monsters are more

33:55.291 --> 33:58.125
than just horrid looks
and claws and teeth.

33:59.208 --> 34:01.750
Monsters are born of deeds done.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.250
Unforgivable ones.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.083
Good night.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.291
Good night, Nivellen.

34:33.958 --> 34:35.666
-[Roach whickers]
-[sighs]

34:39.250 --> 34:41.208
[snorting]

34:49.916 --> 34:51.916
-[wind whistling]
-[horse neighing]

34:57.458 --> 34:59.000
[clicking]

35:03.375 --> 35:05.333
[Roach neighs]

35:37.583 --> 35:41.125
Finest mead from the rarest
Korathian desert honey.

35:48.541 --> 35:50.541
-Aah.
-Let's play a drinking game.

35:50.625 --> 35:52.791
Oh, now we're talking!

35:53.583 --> 35:54.583
What sort?

35:56.458 --> 35:57.791
We throw daggers.

35:58.666 --> 36:01.041
Whoever misses your dear father's head

36:01.625 --> 36:02.500
drinks…

36:03.333 --> 36:04.666
and tells a truth.

36:04.750 --> 36:05.875
Prepare to lose.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.833
-You first. [chuckles]
-Hmm.

36:19.250 --> 36:20.125
[Nivellen laughs]

36:20.750 --> 36:22.708
Let's start with the obvious.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.750
How in the name of all that's sacred…

36:26.583 --> 36:29.875
how did you find yourself
looking after a young girl?

36:29.958 --> 36:32.250
I promised her grandmother
before she died.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.250
[Nivellen chuckles]

36:41.833 --> 36:42.916
What's your plan?

36:43.458 --> 36:44.666
Keep her alive.

36:46.083 --> 36:46.916
That's it?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.583
I can protect her
from any mark of man or monster.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.541
And you said so yourself.
The world is changing.

36:54.375 --> 36:57.041
Perhaps that's why the Law of Surprise
brought us together.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.375
Oh, that devious old chestnut.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.958
-Hmm.
-The plot thickens, huh?

37:03.708 --> 37:06.500
-Your turn.
-[chuckles] Oh-ho-ho-ho.

37:10.291 --> 37:11.166
Bull's-eye.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.583
[laughs]

37:21.500 --> 37:22.916
[Nivellen laughs]

37:23.583 --> 37:25.708
You've become a lightweight, old friend.

37:26.458 --> 37:27.583
So it seems.

37:27.666 --> 37:29.875
You spend a lifetime alone,

37:30.625 --> 37:34.041
then you claim a child
of an ancient promise of destiny.

37:35.541 --> 37:36.875
What changed you?

37:38.791 --> 37:39.625
Who.

37:42.291 --> 37:43.833
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.083
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

37:47.166 --> 37:50.500
And where is this rarest
and fairest of all maidens?

37:50.583 --> 37:53.583
The one who could crack
an icy witcher's heart?

37:53.666 --> 37:54.875
She's dead.

38:02.458 --> 38:03.708
I'm sorry, my boy.

38:05.375 --> 38:06.291
How long ago?

38:08.416 --> 38:09.541
A few days.

38:14.416 --> 38:16.291
How are you not heartbroken?

38:18.625 --> 38:19.750
Who says I'm not?

38:25.750 --> 38:27.750
[horse snorting]

38:28.708 --> 38:30.541
-Your horse, it's lame.
-[Fringilla] I know.

38:31.166 --> 38:32.958
If I dismount, my men will eat it.

38:33.750 --> 38:37.291
Horses, whores, and mages.
All useful till we're not.

38:39.833 --> 38:42.083
Do you really think
offering me as a sacrifice

38:42.166 --> 38:44.083
-will be enough to spare your failure?
-[sighs]

38:44.791 --> 38:46.791
You'll watch my head roll
right before your own.

38:48.916 --> 38:52.125
-Look. The North has won.
-Hmm.

38:52.208 --> 38:55.583
Join us. I'll tell them you saved me.
You can redeem yourself.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.375
Redeem myself from what, exactly?

38:58.041 --> 39:01.916
You think that we ventured north
to conquer? We came to liberate.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.416
You were weak at Aretuza,
but you had your own mind.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.166
That implies choice.

39:06.250 --> 39:10.041
I was placed in a kingdom at the whim
of the Brotherhood's wants. We all were.

39:10.125 --> 39:12.791
Just gilded pawns
to control kingdoms, nothing more.

39:12.875 --> 39:14.708
We weren't forced to do anything.

39:14.791 --> 39:17.041
Should I have left my post as you did?

39:17.125 --> 39:19.500
Shirked my duties, wasted my talents?

39:20.125 --> 39:23.458
-If I'd had Tissaia to shield me--
-If you'd thought for yourself

39:23.541 --> 39:25.000
instead of licking others' boots.

39:26.250 --> 39:28.416
Eager to please. Easy to wound.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.833
You're blind, Yennefer.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.250
-[snorts]
-[Geralt] Anything else?

39:38.333 --> 39:40.208
-[chuckling]
-I have nothing to hide.

39:40.291 --> 39:41.625
From me, maybe.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.416
But have you told the girl the truth?

39:46.375 --> 39:50.458
That witchers obtain children
so they can feed them with magic herbs.

39:51.083 --> 39:54.250
The few who survive
become witchers themselves.

39:54.333 --> 39:57.875
All human feelings and reactions
are trained out of them.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.666
They are turned into monsters

40:00.750 --> 40:02.375
to kill other monsters.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.333
That's not going to happen to her.

40:04.416 --> 40:05.916
But it happened to you.

40:11.541 --> 40:12.875
For better or worse,

40:13.666 --> 40:14.833
she's with you now.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.625
How does she feel about it?

40:19.666 --> 40:21.250
Ohh!

40:21.333 --> 40:24.916
The look of a man
who's worried he's lost his touch.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.375
-[laughs]
-Hmm.

40:30.750 --> 40:34.208
The look of a man who's wondering
why his old friend is cheating.

40:34.291 --> 40:35.333
[gulps]

40:36.291 --> 40:37.750
You've got me there!

40:37.833 --> 40:39.750
[laughs]

40:40.416 --> 40:41.875
Magic knives.

40:41.958 --> 40:43.750
[laughs]

40:43.833 --> 40:44.916
But why?

40:46.458 --> 40:49.083
I've seen you piss yourself
in a wyvern den.

40:50.625 --> 40:53.583
I know who you truly are.
What are you hiding now?

40:54.125 --> 40:56.125
[scoffs]

40:58.875 --> 41:01.583
I need to drain the snake
and hit the silk.

41:04.750 --> 41:07.166
Go to sleep, you sullen old codger.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.916
See you in the morning.

41:10.958 --> 41:12.083
[door closes]

41:17.208 --> 41:18.666
It's all right, Vereena.

41:19.291 --> 41:21.625
-[scratching]
-We won't hurt you.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.416
We're just here for the night.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.583
Then you can have your house back.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.333

42:40.458 --> 42:41.375
Who are you?

42:43.208 --> 42:45.000
I'm Vereena. A friend of Nivellen.

42:48.750 --> 42:51.416
You were having a nightmare.
I came to check on you.

42:54.916 --> 42:56.875
Did you like the dress I left for you?

42:59.083 --> 43:00.125
That was you?

43:02.000 --> 43:02.833
Yes.

43:04.583 --> 43:05.500
Thank you.

43:08.333 --> 43:10.041
-Nivellen said you were a cat.
-Mmm.

43:11.833 --> 43:12.875
What are you?

43:14.916 --> 43:16.875
[distorted] I am different. I am not you.

43:16.958 --> 43:18.583
[high-pitched whine]

43:18.666 --> 43:20.291
-But I am like you.
-[whine fades]

43:22.041 --> 43:23.125
How did you do that?

43:24.333 --> 43:25.583
I've never met anyone…

43:26.125 --> 43:27.958
alone in the heart, like you.

43:28.916 --> 43:29.750
Different.

43:31.625 --> 43:32.625
Not one of many.

43:35.333 --> 43:36.416
-Oh…
-[fluttering]

43:36.500 --> 43:38.208
Why do you travel with that man?

43:39.000 --> 43:40.250
I know what he is.

43:40.833 --> 43:42.375
He kills things.

43:43.541 --> 43:45.250
Monsters, yes.

43:46.416 --> 43:47.250
Kills them.

43:48.291 --> 43:49.333
Hmm.

43:50.916 --> 43:51.875
Are you a monster?

43:54.333 --> 43:56.541
Are you a monster
because you are different?

43:57.708 --> 43:59.666
Monsters do bad things to people.

43:59.750 --> 44:01.916
Humans do bad things to everybody.

44:02.000 --> 44:02.916
-Mmm.
-[soft growl]

44:04.875 --> 44:05.708
Nivellen…

44:07.708 --> 44:09.250
He hid you from the witcher.

44:14.375 --> 44:15.333
He loves you.

44:16.625 --> 44:17.916
-[soft growl]
-Mmm.

44:25.041 --> 44:27.000
[distorted] This must be our secret.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.416
Until you leave.

44:30.666 --> 44:31.750
Hmm.

-Roach is by the gate.

46:04.291 --> 46:07.458
If anyone other than me leaves this place,
ride for your life.

46:07.541 --> 46:10.125
-What's happening?
-There's a bruxa in the house.

46:10.791 --> 46:12.750
A what? What are you doing?

46:14.166 --> 46:15.416
What's going on, Geralt?

46:15.500 --> 46:16.500
[growls] Move.

46:17.333 --> 46:18.625
Now.

Uh… I can't help myself if you run.

48:55.000 --> 48:55.875
He's wrong.

50:22.625 --> 50:23.583
Geralt!

50:23.666 --> 50:25.666
-[sighs]
-[slow clicking]

50:30.250 --> 50:31.291
Geralt!

50:31.375 --> 50:32.625
[clicking speeding up]

50:36.041 --> 50:37.750
-[screeching]
-[grunts]

50:49.208 --> 50:50.541
Cirilla.

50:51.333 --> 50:53.416
-Geralt, wait. Please.
-Get away from it.

50:59.291 --> 51:01.000
I'll rip her throat out

51:01.541 --> 51:03.708
unless you leave us alone!

51:05.416 --> 51:06.458
[screeches]

51:08.541 --> 51:10.166
[Vereena wails]

51:12.791 --> 51:13.958
I'm sorry.

51:15.500 --> 51:17.875
I'm so sorry.

51:18.416 --> 51:20.000
[wheezing]

51:20.583 --> 51:22.666
[crunching]

51:30.125 --> 51:31.333
[gasps]

51:32.875 --> 51:33.875
Mine…

51:37.000 --> 51:38.375
[gasping]

51:38.458 --> 51:40.500
…or nobody's.

51:44.583 --> 51:46.000
[whimpers]

51:46.083 --> 51:47.208
I love you.

51:52.791 --> 51:53.625
Love you.

51:54.208 --> 51:55.041
Huh?

51:55.625 --> 51:57.208
[screeches]

51:57.750 --> 51:58.583
No!

52:00.833 --> 52:02.166
No!

52:03.041 --> 52:05.000
[yells] No!

52:05.875 --> 52:06.958
-[sobbing]
-[gasps]

52:09.916 --> 52:11.791
He'll come for you too.

52:15.208 --> 52:16.625
[roaring sounds]

52:16.708 --> 52:17.958
[groaning]

52:18.541 --> 52:20.041
[screaming]

52:24.958 --> 52:25.875
[groans]

52:36.083 --> 52:37.791
[gasping]

52:39.875 --> 52:40.875
Why, Geralt?

52:44.916 --> 52:45.875
It's wrong.

52:46.833 --> 52:47.916
It's wrong. [groans]

52:48.625 --> 52:50.750
[yells] It's all wrong!

52:51.583 --> 52:53.083
The curse has lifted.

52:55.458 --> 52:56.916
You are free now.

52:58.416 --> 52:59.291
Free?

53:01.958 --> 53:03.708
This is what you call…

53:04.875 --> 53:06.000
free?

53:06.083 --> 53:07.375
[sighs]

53:12.083 --> 53:13.666
I found her in the woods.

53:15.125 --> 53:15.958
Injured.

53:16.750 --> 53:17.625
Starving.

53:20.166 --> 53:21.666
She wasn't scared of me.

53:23.666 --> 53:24.916
And when she healed…

53:27.208 --> 53:28.833
she chose to stay.

53:30.041 --> 53:31.250
She didn't care…

53:32.916 --> 53:34.125
what I looked like.

53:35.333 --> 53:37.041
And to ease her cravings,

53:38.208 --> 53:39.875
I let her feed on me.

53:40.875 --> 53:43.166
-But--
-[Geralt] She couldn't control herself?

53:46.583 --> 53:47.666
She was a monster.

53:50.791 --> 53:51.625
No.

53:54.625 --> 53:55.583
That's not true.

53:58.125 --> 54:00.041
[Ciri] It doesn't matter
if she was or wasn't.

54:02.375 --> 54:03.208
She loved you.

54:06.666 --> 54:07.833
Love and blood.

54:09.791 --> 54:11.750
They both possess a mighty power.

54:14.291 --> 54:17.958
Learned men and mages have wracked
their brains over it for years.

54:20.625 --> 54:23.708
-And they've arrived at nothing except…
-…true love.

54:26.500 --> 54:27.500
To lose…

54:29.583 --> 54:30.583
true love.

54:33.166 --> 54:34.291
That's what it is.

54:45.458 --> 54:46.500
I knowingly…

54:47.708 --> 54:51.000
turned my eyes away
from what she did to the villagers,

54:52.416 --> 54:53.916
because she didn't care

54:54.416 --> 54:56.750
that I was cursed all those years ago.

54:57.958 --> 54:59.833
Not for destroying the temple.

55:03.416 --> 55:04.916
For raping the priestess.

55:10.958 --> 55:12.083
Ciri…

55:22.458 --> 55:23.750
[grunts]

55:28.916 --> 55:31.208
Please stay. Don't go.

55:33.083 --> 55:34.083
I beg you.

55:35.625 --> 55:36.791
Use your sword.

55:38.125 --> 55:39.000
End this.

55:40.250 --> 55:41.125
For me.

55:43.375 --> 55:44.625
You're mortal now.

55:46.416 --> 55:47.708
Do it yourself.

55:47.791 --> 55:48.625
[sobs]

55:55.500 --> 55:57.291
[whooshing]

56:22.333 --> 56:23.500
[sighs]

56:27.583 --> 56:29.916
When I say run,

56:31.583 --> 56:32.500
you run.

56:34.291 --> 56:35.500
When I say hide,

56:36.875 --> 56:37.708
you hide.

56:39.750 --> 56:41.666
-And when I say get to Roach--
-I know.

56:44.166 --> 56:45.208
[sighs]

56:52.875 --> 56:54.708
I think there's something wrong with me.

56:58.750 --> 57:00.916
Everywhere I go, people die.

57:05.958 --> 57:06.916
Sometimes, I…

57:10.833 --> 57:12.083
I feel like I could…

57:13.958 --> 57:15.291
burn the whole world.

57:17.833 --> 57:19.250
I wouldn't mean to.

57:20.541 --> 57:21.375
Just…

57:22.708 --> 57:24.458
It just makes me feel so afraid.

57:26.250 --> 57:27.250
All the time.

57:30.125 --> 57:31.250
Fear is an illness.

57:33.458 --> 57:35.625
If you catch it
and you leave it untreated,

57:36.625 --> 57:37.958
it can consume you.

57:40.375 --> 57:41.666
How do you treat it?

57:42.208 --> 57:43.208
You face it.

57:44.583 --> 57:46.458
Facing your fear is not easy.

57:47.875 --> 57:49.375
But I am here for you.

57:51.916 --> 57:53.708
I won't let anything happen to you.

57:59.125 --> 58:00.166
All right.

58:13.500 --> 58:14.541
[Geralt sighs]

58:15.791 --> 58:17.958
[Fringilla] Enough! To your feet!

58:18.791 --> 58:22.166
Cut what you need, and get moving.
We need to reach Cintra by dawn.

58:22.916 --> 58:23.875
Look at them.

58:24.458 --> 58:27.208
You're leading them
to a salvation that doesn't exist.

58:28.166 --> 58:29.708
How long before they turn on you?

58:30.791 --> 58:32.125
-[thumping]
-[screaming]

58:32.208 --> 58:33.916
-[groaning]
-Archers!

58:35.500 --> 58:37.708
Release me. You know
I'm more powerful.

58:38.333 --> 58:39.875
-I can save us.
-I've got nothing!

58:39.958 --> 58:41.541
[branches cracking]

58:43.000 --> 58:44.500
-Where are they?
-I can't see 'em.

58:50.666 --> 58:52.375
[creaking]

58:55.208 --> 58:56.583
[screaming]
