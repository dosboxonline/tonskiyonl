WEBVTT

01:26.417 --> 01:29.666
You may now kiss the bride.

01:29.750 --> 01:34.541
From now on, he'll care of you
and you'll take care of him.

01:34.625 --> 01:38.708
He'll make you big bologna
sandwiches and you'll buy him socks

01:38.792 --> 01:43.666
and a white briefcase and you'll live
happily ever after.

01:43.750 --> 01:48.541
You're the luckiest girl in the world,
Barbie. The luckiest girl.

01:49.542 --> 01:49.583
You're the luckiest girl in the world.
When I did Whitney Houston's wedding,

01:51.000 --> 01:58.166
she was even more nervous than you. And
you look 10 times better than she did!

01:58.167 --> 02:02.333
No, I don't. This isn't going to work.
I'm fat!

02:03.375 --> 02:07.624
I’m going to marry the wrong guy!
-Look at me.

02:08.167 --> 02:11.499
You are exquisite! You're timeless.

02:13.334 --> 02:17.416
You're the future sister-in-Janice
whom I overheard say the last gown

02:17.500 --> 02:21.541
fitting: Look at those thighs!
I'd kill for,

02:21.625 --> 02:24.749
Tracy's thighs!

02:25.000 --> 02:28.833
But you have more than great thighs.

02:29.042 --> 02:33.833
You have the love of a man named Tom.
A man who walked into

02:33.917 --> 02:36.999
rehearsal dinner the other day, said,

02:37.084 --> 02:41.416
I can't believe I’m marrying

02:41.500 --> 02:46.708
the most beautiful woman.

02:48.250 --> 02:52.874
That tells me this marriage
is not only going to work

02:52.959 --> 02:56.708
it's gonna last forever.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.624
Thank you.

03:07.459 --> 03:11.291
Excuse me...
-What are you doing?

03:13.292 --> 03:15.708
Thank you.

03:15.792 --> 03:20.999
Keep to areas, A, B and E. Don't want
any interference with the video team.

03:25.584 --> 03:30.458
I know who you're looking for.
They're downstairs.

03:34.584 --> 03:38.166
Father, where are you going?
-Nature calls.

03:38.250 --> 03:43.124
You'll have to call back later.
We're about to start. Let's go.

04:01.209 --> 04:04.958
Penny, stop flirting.
We're going in one...

04:09.375 --> 04:14.416
Penny, go to M-12.
We got a Dark Tower choking the A.V.

04:15.417 --> 04:20.374
Ma'am, you are in the preferred
seating list, if you just follow me.

04:23.542 --> 04:27.874
You can't enjoy the wedding from
Back here. Dark Tower demolished.

04:27.959 --> 04:32.749
Places everyone.
Todd, cut the fill lights.

04:33.875 --> 04:37.291
Maestro, on 3...
-We can't find the

04:37.625 --> 04:41.708
father of the bride.
-I got it. Penny, send over the F.O.B.

04:41.709 --> 04:45.999
I did 15 minutes ago.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.916
Cover me up north. F.O.B. is M.I.A.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.833
Oh no.
Count to a 100 and then start again.

05:12.959 --> 05:18.166
Father,
you're going to have to hold it.

05:26.875 --> 05:31.666
Guys, we're on. Put your jackets on.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.666
I have a 20 on the F.O.B.

05:37.750 --> 05:42.958
My little girl
is getting married today.

05:44.209 --> 05:48.041
I remember her graduation
from nursery school.

05:48.125 --> 05:52.291
When she was a little girl...
I remember her

05:53.459 --> 05:56.416
like it was yesterday.
Who are you?

05:56.500 --> 05:59.791
I’m the wedding planner.

06:19.334 --> 06:22.458
Look! There's the wedding planner.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.666
She must lead such a romantic life.

08:11.459 --> 08:13.541
Earwax...

08:13.625 --> 08:18.166
X on a triple word, 72 points!

08:18.250 --> 08:22.166
I challenge you. Earwax is 2 words.
-It's one!

08:22.334 --> 08:25.583
You're bluffing.
-Munch, 16 points!

08:25.667 --> 08:29.416
16?
-I know I’m a big pain in the neck.

08:29.792 --> 08:33.749
I just want you to be happy.
I’m going to say something that

08:33.833 --> 08:38.041
you may be resistant to but sometimes,
a father has to take action.

08:38.125 --> 08:41.957
What are you talking about?
-I found you a man

08:42.042 --> 08:45.958
that has agreed to marry you.
-lf her mother was alive...

08:46.250 --> 08:50.208
lf she heard that,
she'd wish she was dead.

08:50.292 --> 08:52.833
Shaft. 22 points.

08:52.917 --> 08:56.458
You know him. Remember Massimo?

08:56.542 --> 09:00.374
No! Who?
-Massimo Lenzetti, the boy you played

09:00.459 --> 09:04.541
with the summer we spent in Italy.
-The kid who ate mud?

09:04.625 --> 09:08.958
That's the one! I bumped into him.
New Arrivals Night

09:09.042 --> 09:13.833
at the Sicilian Association.
-The most wonderful day of my life!

09:14.250 --> 09:17.499
A man of my very own!

09:17.584 --> 09:21.374
You must bring me to him at once!
-No need!

09:21.459 --> 09:23.458
He's here?

09:23.542 --> 09:26.666
He's here? He's...
-Massimo!

09:28.084 --> 09:32.333
He didn't...
-Oh my God.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.124
Oh my God!

09:38.334 --> 09:40.416
Maria!

09:40.667 --> 09:45.833
You remember Massimo?
-That mud did him good!

09:47.875 --> 09:51.958
The last time I see you, you were
scrawny and ugly and your head

09:52.042 --> 09:55.541
was too big for your body.
-How nice. Thank you.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.791
You're welcome.

09:58.875 --> 10:02.916
I look forward to our life together.
I want 3 sons and

10:03.000 --> 10:08.583
a garden of tomatoes.
-Ok then...

10:08.667 --> 10:11.499
Maria, wait!

10:26.292 --> 10:28.291
Good morning.

10:28.375 --> 10:31.708
The paper. And that Yahoo too.
-4.50.

10:32.292 --> 10:35.791
Keep it.

10:45.125 --> 10:50.083
You look excited.
-I am!

10:51.292 --> 10:55.374
Mary, I need...
-Can you take it.

10:59.375 --> 11:03.458
Francine Donolly. The family started
selling gourmet sausages out of their

11:03.542 --> 11:05.541
small working-class kitchen.

11:05.625 --> 11:10.374
Now, 5 years later they're one of the
biggest Internet food company.

11:10.459 --> 11:14.541
Pierre, I love you but if you use
another carnation in my bouquet,

11:14.625 --> 11:17.999
I will deport you. Thank you so much.

11:18.084 --> 11:22.541
They put her wedding announcement
in the society pages. Why?

11:22.625 --> 11:26.708
Because they want their new money...
-Sheila, book the Gazebo Package

11:26.792 --> 11:30.874
for the Beletti's. Take this ugly
flower. Call David, we need a

11:30.959 --> 11:34.624
rush order on the chupah rental.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.708
Geri!
-What is this?

11:36.792 --> 11:40.791
Sunless tanning cream.
Wedding's tomorrow. You do the math.

11:40.875 --> 11:44.958
Stop crying. A quarter cup of lemon
juice, salt and a loofah sponge.

11:45.042 --> 11:47.833
Really?
-Scrub, scrub, scrub!

11:47.917 --> 11:51.999
They see this as their ticket into the
club. They want to make it a event.

11:52.084 --> 11:56.916
The party everybody talks about.
-Thank you, sweetie.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.499
I already made contact. They're at the
Copeland wedding to see my work.

12:02.875 --> 12:07.541
I’m going to nail this account. We'll
be in every major bridal magazine.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.999
It'll be our biggest event ever!
When I pull it off,

12:11.084 --> 12:15.249
you're going to make me a partner.
-Partner?

12:15.834 --> 12:19.083
Yes.
-A partner!

12:19.167 --> 12:24.124
You're fantastic! Incredible, really.
Very good work

12:24.417 --> 12:29.041
but let me tell you something:
I built this business on my back.

12:29.125 --> 12:32.291
I sweat, I toiled. I did things

12:32.375 --> 12:37.374
that a innocent little wedding planner
should never hear. I won't even say it.

12:37.459 --> 12:42.166
I made the big plans.
I made the sacrifices.

12:42.250 --> 12:46.124
You also never made any money.
-Wow!

12:46.209 --> 12:50.916
Until I came along.
I've been here for 5 years, Geri.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.208
I bring in more revenue than all
Your other wedding planners combined!

12:58.084 --> 13:02.416
You know you need me.
I know that you know

13:02.500 --> 13:06.041
that you need me.
-I don't know that.

13:06.125 --> 13:10.374
Maybe I should start my own company.
-You wouldn't dare.

13:10.459 --> 13:14.541
lf I nailed the Donolly account and
you made me a partner you'd save me

13:14.625 --> 13:19.749
the trouble of designing my own
letterhead. What font would I use...

13:19.834 --> 13:22.874
You'll be partner!
-First the order.

13:22.959 --> 13:27.958
Mary, you're totally going to get it!
-The Greenburg lasted 14 months.

13:28.042 --> 13:32.124
How do you do that? I was 4 years off!
-Their song was "I honestly love you"

13:32.209 --> 13:36.291
from Olivia Newton-John. 14 months!
-Speaking of honest, Jed asked

13:36.375 --> 13:39.291
about you again.
-Don't trust a man who gets pedicures.

13:39.500 --> 13:43.541
You haven't been on a date in 2 years.
lf you're not interested in Jed,

13:43.625 --> 13:48.291
there's a tall Italian waiting to marry.
-Did you talk to him?

13:48.375 --> 13:51.416
Just for a few minutes. He's so adorable!
-He isn't.

13:51.500 --> 13:55.333
How can you say that?
-When we we're kids, he followed me,

13:55.417 --> 13:59.249
asking if I had a vagina!
-I think that's adorable.

13:59.334 --> 14:01.708
I gotta get out of here.
-Great.

14:02.125 --> 14:06.208
Quick, grab this side.
-You shouldn't hold that against him.

14:06.292 --> 14:10.166
You should give him a chance.
-He was a little boy!

14:10.250 --> 14:15.749
Maybe he wanted to be a doctor.
Besides, you do have a vagina.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.874
May you have enough happiness
to keep you sweet,

14:20.959 --> 14:24.416
enough trials to keep you strong,

14:24.500 --> 14:28.583
enough hope to keep you happy.
-Enough friends

14:28.667 --> 14:33.499
to give you comfort.
Enough determination

14:33.584 --> 14:36.916
to make each day a better day.
-To make each day a better day

14:37.000 --> 14:40.583
than yesterday.
-Raise your glass.

14:40.667 --> 14:44.249
Congratulations. I love you both.

14:46.709 --> 14:50.249
What? You think Kissinger came up
with his own stuff?

14:50.334 --> 14:53.958
You just fed the Best Man his speech.

14:54.042 --> 14:57.583
Smooth. Real smooth.
-You must be Francine.

14:57.667 --> 15:01.999
Your article at Yahoo, very impressive.
-I hate that picture.

15:02.084 --> 15:06.374
It made me look
like a psychotic poodle.

15:09.417 --> 15:13.666
My fiancé has to see this.
He will just die.

15:13.750 --> 15:17.666
He should be here by now.
-Most grooms are N.I.D.'s.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.499
Not into Details.
-That's Eddie.

15:22.584 --> 15:26.083
Come, I want you to meet my parents.

15:26.209 --> 15:29.499
Thanks. It rocked!

15:30.209 --> 15:35.166
Mary, meet my parents, Kitty and Jack.
-So nice to meet you.

15:35.250 --> 15:39.416
Dad, are you eating the food?
-The champagne is delightful.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.833
Cristal? D.P.?
-It is Taittinger.

15:43.709 --> 15:48.916
Mother, we're guests. You're not
supposed to be drinking the champagne.

15:49.792 --> 15:53.874
Give her whatever she wants.
-I'll be faxing you a of list songs

15:53.959 --> 15:58.249
I’ll be performing at the reception.
-No mini-egg rolls. We got V.I.P. coming

15:58.334 --> 16:03.166
and an impression to make.
-We haven't hired her yet.

16:03.250 --> 16:07.416
Mother, as previously discussed,
you won't be singing at the wedding.

16:11.042 --> 16:14.583
The belly dancer is here and she has
a tattoo of an extremely big...

16:14.667 --> 16:19.041
I want you to meet the Donollys.
This is one of my associates, Penny.

16:19.125 --> 16:22.166
Pleasure.
-You know what I need you to do?

16:22.250 --> 16:27.374
To go to prepare the Murdock file.
-Murdock, as in...

16:28.209 --> 16:30.291
Discretion.

16:30.875 --> 16:34.291
The Murdock files! Right.

16:35.709 --> 16:39.583
Now, wedding woman, let's get down
to brass tacks.

16:39.667 --> 16:43.833
What do you see for a wedding?
-Well,

16:44.084 --> 16:47.249
now having met you

16:47.334 --> 16:50.624
off the top of my head:

16:50.875 --> 16:53.166
I say:

16:53.875 --> 16:55.958
Night.

16:56.209 --> 17:00.999
Dubounce Botanical Gardens.
White silk tents close enough

17:01.084 --> 17:04.124
to see the stars.

17:04.209 --> 17:07.874
Candlelight. Wedgewood.

17:08.459 --> 17:13.333
Exotic Waringin trees imported
from Bali. I’m thinking:

17:13.625 --> 17:17.708
Gatsby. Not a period wedding

17:18.709 --> 17:21.790
but the spirit of it.

17:24.125 --> 17:28.999
I nailed it, Geri. But they want it in
3 months. They're going for June.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.999
I know, the clock is ticking.
Put Penny on.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.583
Guess what, Penny...

17:41.709 --> 17:43.916
Hold on, Penny!

17:46.250 --> 17:47.958
My shoe!

17:56.500 --> 17:59.624
Not my good shoe!

17:59.625 --> 18:02.749
Oh my goodness.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.666
My new Gucci shoe!

18:17.750 --> 18:21.249
Are you ok?

18:24.500 --> 18:26.874
I’m great.

18:26.959 --> 18:31.291
Where's my shoe?
-Your shoe? You got it right here.

18:31.792 --> 18:36.208
Talk to me. How are you feeling?
Are you experiencing any dizziness,

18:36.292 --> 18:39.874
nausea, difficulty breathing?

18:40.584 --> 18:43.999
The breathing thing rings a bell.

18:44.542 --> 18:48.583
Then again, you are on top of me,
cutting off my air supply.

18:48.584 --> 18:53.624
Your mental clarity is excellent.
That's good.

18:53.709 --> 18:58.374
You don't appear to have a concussion.
You took quite a fall.

18:58.459 --> 19:01.874
Why are you still on top of me?

19:05.125 --> 19:08.791
That's a good question.
You see that dumpster there?

19:08.875 --> 19:12.874
It seems it tried to kill you.
You were standing in the middle

19:12.959 --> 19:17.749
of the road and it was coming right
at you. Now, just take your time, ok?

19:18.792 --> 19:22.124
You saved my shoe.

19:23.584 --> 19:26.708
I meant, my life.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.791
The shoe was what I was going for.
You just turned out to be a bonus.

19:30.875 --> 19:35.541
Now, we're gonna try and get up.
Take your time. Up,

19:35.625 --> 19:39.458
you're ok. I got you,

19:42.292 --> 19:45.416
you're ok?

19:46.667 --> 19:50.499
You smell like sweet red plums

19:51.959 --> 19:55.624
and grilled cheese sandwiches.

20:01.792 --> 20:05.583
I get that all the time, thank you.
Hold up!

20:05.667 --> 20:07.749
You're alright.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.624
She's dead alright.
-Do you think she's going to heaven?

20:13.709 --> 20:18.416
Definitely! She's got the cleanest
toes I’ve ever seen!

20:18.500 --> 20:21.541
Where am l?
-You're in the children's ward of

20:21.625 --> 20:26.833
St. Vincent's hospital.
I’m your doctor. Try not to talk.

20:30.125 --> 20:34.041
I’m paralyzed! I’m paralyzed!

20:34.417 --> 20:38.333
You're moving your arms and legs.
You're clearly not paralyzed.

20:41.584 --> 20:45.458
Thank you. Here's my flashlight.
Thank you. How's our patient doing?

20:45.542 --> 20:50.541
It was touch and go there for a while.
-Was it? Whaddya recommend?

20:50.625 --> 20:55.666
I think she needs more fluids.
-Why don't you go load her up

20:55.750 --> 20:59.416
with 10 cc's of Yoohoo. Here we go.
-You're the guy...

21:00.709 --> 21:04.249
Steve Edison.
I’m the supervising pediatrician here.

21:04.334 --> 21:07.916
I’m Mary...
-Fiore. Yeah, I know. I had to go

21:08.000 --> 21:12.083
through your wallet to get your
identification. You know, I must say,

21:12.167 --> 21:16.708
I’ve never met anyone who alphabetized
their credit cards before. Here's the

21:16.792 --> 21:20.833
skinny on you. X-rays are fine,
hemoglobin levels are normal.

21:20.917 --> 21:26.124
We're just waiting on the Catscan to be
processed. You can take this off now.

21:26.709 --> 21:29.874
You got a big neck.
-I have a big neck?

21:29.959 --> 21:34.041
Don't get me wrong. It’s a fine neck.
It’s just... I haven't had a patient

21:34.125 --> 21:37.624
over the age of 6 in 3 years.

21:44.542 --> 21:48.458
What happened to your hand?
-My hand?

21:48.917 --> 21:52.916
You fell on it with your big neck.

22:18.334 --> 22:21.458
Thank you Dr. Steve.

22:28.209 --> 22:32.416
Your Catscan came back
and it's all clear.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.999
So, I’m ok?
-You're better than new.

22:37.167 --> 22:41.249
That's a pretty modern girl you have.

22:42.042 --> 22:44.791
Who?
-You're girl friend.

22:44.875 --> 22:49.249
No, that's my sister.
You could say she's modern.

22:49.334 --> 22:53.374
Last time I saw her,
she had a spike through her chin.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.999
Oh my...
-I don't understand how she got

22:57.084 --> 23:01.166
near the dumpster! Oh my God!

23:01.250 --> 23:04.291
You're alive!
-How did you find me?

23:04.375 --> 23:08.458
The nurse found my phone number
taped to your Palm Pilot

23:08.542 --> 23:13.749
and told me what happened!
Is this guy who saved you?

23:14.917 --> 23:20.083
I wouldn't exactly call it a rescue.
It was just in the right place

23:20.167 --> 23:23.791
at the right time.
-Fine.

23:23.875 --> 23:28.291
Aren't you just the modern day hero.

23:33.125 --> 23:36.499
Penny?
-Are you ok?

23:40.584 --> 23:44.916
Fabulous! Penny Nicholson.
Nice to meet you.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.124
I’m Steve Edison. It’s nice to meet
you too. Please sit down.

23:50.334 --> 23:54.083
Mary is going to be fine.
-You must work long hours.

23:54.167 --> 23:57.958
Are you working late tonight?
-No. I’m not even

23:58.084 --> 24:01.833
on duty tonight.
-Great!

24:01.917 --> 24:05.833
Mary and I were gonna go to Golden
Gate Park. They show old movies

24:05.917 --> 24:09.458
on the museum.
And you should come with us.

24:09.542 --> 24:12.541
-Nice.
We won't take a No for an answer.

24:12.542 --> 24:16.708
Penny, will you leave him alone?
-You don't want me to go?

24:16.709 --> 24:20.666
No!
-Of course, she wants you to go.

24:20.750 --> 24:24.249
The truth is doctor,

24:24.792 --> 24:29.458
I’ve been thinking about a career in
medicine, something medicinal or

24:29.542 --> 24:34.666
whatnot... I’d really like to just
pick a part of your brain.

24:35.209 --> 24:36.374
I know what's best for you.
I’m gonna get you over this

24:39.375 --> 24:43.458
Keith thing, once and for all!
-It’s only been 6 years.

24:43.542 --> 24:48.208
This isn't a date! Don't leave me!
-Penny, please don't you dare!

24:48.292 --> 24:50.291
Hi.
-Hello.

24:50.375 --> 24:54.291
Hello, there he is. Good.
You never get the colors you want.

24:58.375 --> 25:02.541
Oh no! Darn it, I just remembered that
I promised my friend's brother's

25:02.542 --> 25:06.958
godmother that I would help her change

25:07.042 --> 25:10.083
her fax cartridge tonight,

25:11.209 --> 25:15.374
because she's going out of town

25:15.459 --> 25:20.124
tomorrow on an African safari!
I should go. I’m sorry we're not

25:20.417 --> 25:25.208
going to be able to have that...
-Medical chat.

25:31.375 --> 25:34.958
Goodness! I hope...

25:36.709 --> 25:40.541
her friend's brother's godmother
is gonna be ok.

25:41.042 --> 25:44.083
I have reserved seating.
-Alright.

25:44.167 --> 25:47.083
Let's go.

25:48.042 --> 25:52.124
Thanks for guarding my tree.
-Yes. There's your blanket,

25:52.209 --> 25:54.833
right there by the tree.
-Thank you. Burt, that's Steve Edison.

25:54.917 --> 25:57.958
Steve, nice to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you, Burt.

25:58.042 --> 26:01.333
It’s about time you had a date.
What line of business are you in?

26:01.417 --> 26:04.624
I’m a doctor at St. Vincent's.
-Your'e a doctor. He's a doctor.

26:04.709 --> 26:07.749
Burt!
-I get the hint.

26:07.834 --> 26:11.791
See you at the Scrabble practice.
-I’m so sorry

26:11.875 --> 26:15.958
about that.
-A Scrabble practice?

26:16.042 --> 26:19.708
Please, don't ask.
-Come on, you can't leave me

26:19.792 --> 26:24.374
hanging on that. What is that?
See you at Scrabble practice?

26:24.834 --> 26:28.874
I’m a member of the Bay Area
Scrabble Club, pathetic, I know.

26:28.959 --> 26:30.999
Wow!
-What?

26:31.084 --> 26:34.374
That is pathetic.
-Shut up.

26:34.917 --> 26:38.833
At least I can spell. What can you do?
-Throw a mean yo-yo.

26:38.917 --> 26:43.708
No more caramel corn for you.
-I’m serious.

26:44.042 --> 26:48.208
How did you get into it?
I never met anyone who's a member

26:48.292 --> 26:50.374
of a Scrabble Club.

26:51.167 --> 26:55.958
When my parents came over from Italy,
they joined a Scrabble Club

26:56.042 --> 27:00.333
so they could learn English.
After my Mom died

27:00.417 --> 27:04.458
my Dad became obsessed with the game
and wanted me to play with him

27:04.542 --> 27:09.499
all the time. I guess I was destined.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.666
C-O-O-L.

27:19.709 --> 27:22.833
What are you doing?

27:24.750 --> 27:27.791
I only eat the brown ones.
-Because?

27:27.875 --> 27:32.374
I figure they have less
artificial coloring

27:32.459 --> 27:36.791
because chocolate is already brown.
-That's very scientific of you,

27:36.875 --> 27:40.083
Doctor Steve.
-Thank you, Mary.

27:42.959 --> 27:46.958
Where cuold I see a Scrabble match.
-Oh, look,

27:47.042 --> 27:50.166
it's starting.

28:07.375 --> 28:11.083
It’s beautiful.
-Do you like it?

28:26.292 --> 28:30.416
This is the coolest thing
I’ve ever done in this city.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.124
You wanna dance?

28:43.792 --> 28:48.208
I don't know.
I haven't danced in quite some time.

28:48.292 --> 28:51.291
A girl asks to dance, you dance.

28:51.792 --> 28:54.916
Burt
-Burt's right.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.499
Yes, Mary, I would like to dance.

28:59.209 --> 29:03.458
No pressure.
-It’s too late now.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.416
Ok.

29:19.834 --> 29:24.958
Where did you learn to dance?
-Ballroom class.

29:25.042 --> 29:30.249
You're gay!
-The gayest.

29:33.334 --> 29:36.708
What a pity.
-My mother put me

29:37.250 --> 29:41.083
in ballroom classes
when I was 8 years old.

29:41.167 --> 29:46.333
She wanted me to be Fred Astaire.
I wanted to be Marcus Welby.

29:46.417 --> 29:49.499
So, now you're a little of both?

29:51.250 --> 29:56.458
You're being kind, Mary.
You better stop. I’m going to blush.

30:00.667 --> 30:03.791
How is your thumb?

30:04.209 --> 30:07.291
Never better.

30:26.917 --> 30:31.249
Y.M.C.A.
My next Scrabble match is Saturday,

30:31.792 --> 30:36.999
at 1 o'clock, at Northside Y.M.C.A.
It’ll be the event of the season.

30:38.917 --> 30:42.333
Maybe you should be there.

30:45.417 --> 30:48.916
Maybe you shouldn't step on my foot.
-Did l?

30:49.000 --> 30:53.749
I’m sorry.
-Ok. Just don't let it happen again.

30:54.042 --> 30:58.166
Don't tell me what to do.
-Don't what?

31:35.375 --> 31:39.541
Are you guys crazy?
-I’m thinking teal

31:39.709 --> 31:43.124
for the bridesmaids.
What do you think?

31:43.584 --> 31:48.583
Good morning. Earth to Mary.
What is up with you? You're different.

31:48.667 --> 31:53.874
I’m not different. How am I different?
-You can't stop smiling.

31:54.500 --> 31:58.416
I’m not smiling. Am I smiling?
-Like a fool.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.374
Tell me.
-It’s nothing.

32:01.459 --> 32:05.458
Then stop smiling.
-I can't.

32:05.542 --> 32:08.666
Who is he?

32:12.167 --> 32:17.374
Mister Kotsioupolis, you cannot throw
plates at the Ritz-fucking-Carlton!

32:19.875 --> 32:21.916
A fairy tale.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.458
He saved your life. You danced under
the stars. You kissed in the rain.

32:25.542 --> 32:29.624
Almost kissed. I don't know, Fran,
I’ve been so out

32:29.709 --> 32:32.749
of the dating relationship loop.
-You?

32:32.834 --> 32:36.791
Those who can't do, teach.
Those who can't wed, plan.

32:36.875 --> 32:40.291
With my help,
you can marry this man in 3 months.

32:40.375 --> 32:45.583
I’ve lost control! Please help me!
-Penny, if you can't beat em...

32:46.709 --> 32:49.749
What has gotten into you?
-She met a guy.

32:49.834 --> 32:54.333
You met a guy?

32:57.959 --> 33:03.166
Tell me all about it.
-I owe you one, Penny.

33:05.375 --> 33:08.916
Hello, Rene. How are you?
-Great.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.166
They're gonna be signing up for 6
classes. Be sure to pay up front.

33:13.167 --> 33:16.958
Basil is gonna be here today.
-Really?

33:19.334 --> 33:22.999
Yes. I’ll call back. Bye.

33:23.709 --> 33:26.749
Mary, what are you doing here?
-Fran?

33:26.834 --> 33:30.874
Oh my God, I’m so embarrassed. I may
be a hell of a business woman but when

33:30.875 --> 33:35.166
I dance, I look like a string bean.
-I thought your class was Thursday?

33:35.250 --> 33:39.208
I had to change it. But this is
perfect. You can finally meet Eddie.

33:39.292 --> 33:43.083
Eddie! Eddie? Come here.

33:43.167 --> 33:47.249
Want you to meet the wedding planner.
The 2 most important people in my life

33:47.334 --> 33:51.708
set eyes on one another. Eddie,
this is Mary, the wedding planner.

33:51.709 --> 33:55.416
Mary, this is my fiancé, Eddie.

34:00.542 --> 34:02.624
Hi.

34:04.209 --> 34:07.499
Hi.
-Mary, are you ok?

34:08.917 --> 34:12.291
Yep. Good.

34:12.667 --> 34:16.248
Let's see who that is.

34:17.500 --> 34:21.583
Hi, Dad! Wait, I can't hear you.
I got you.

34:21.667 --> 34:26.248
I’m losing you again I’m sorry. Hello?

34:26.333 --> 34:31.041
Do you hear me?
-Quick, get your tootsies out here.

34:31.125 --> 34:35.833
Welcome to the Basil Saint Mosley
School of Dance.

34:35.917 --> 34:39.541
I am Basil Saint Mosley.

34:39.625 --> 34:43.623
Wait a second, I can't here you,
you're breaking up...

34:43.708 --> 34:47.791
I’d like all my lovely couples,
dancing partners paired up in twos

34:47.875 --> 34:51.458
ready to dance right now.
-Dance with Eddie.

34:51.542 --> 34:53.541
I can't!
-It’s important.

34:53.625 --> 34:58.166
Is there a problem? I’d like us to be
still young when this class is over.

34:58.250 --> 35:02.083
I have to take this call.
-I understand you're busy. I’m too.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.749
You're holding the class.
-She's with him.

35:05.834 --> 35:09.749
Mary, watch out for his thumb.
He hurt is saving some old lady.

35:09.834 --> 35:14.791
I can't do this.
-Wallflowers, it's time to blossom.

35:14.875 --> 35:18.958
To bloom. Obviously, what we have here,
people, is a fear of dancing.

35:19.042 --> 35:23.208
It’s my firm belief
we must conquer ones fears.

35:23.834 --> 35:27.916
I’ve go gage what I’m dealing with,

35:28.000 --> 35:32.624
so I’ll play music, you'll dance
and I will observe. Ok. Rene?

35:32.709 --> 35:35.541
Yes, thank you.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.749
Mary, would you like to dance?
-Have no fear. Dance!

35:39.834 --> 35:42.749
Dance! Dance! Dance!

35:45.709 --> 35:48.749
Old lady?
-Listen, this is...

35:48.834 --> 35:52.916
You told me your name was Steve?
-It is. My name is Edison.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.083
Eddie is a nickname.
-Got a better: cheating, sleazy...

35:57.167 --> 36:02.374
lf you think...
-I think of a machete and pliers.

36:06.167 --> 36:10.583
Remember the day you had the accident?
I was running late.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.749
How convenient.
-I was on my way to meet Fran and our

36:14.834 --> 36:19.499
wedding planner. What are the odds?
-Dance! Dance!

36:21.625 --> 36:25.708
You didn't show that day because you
don't want to get married!

36:25.792 --> 36:28.833
I see it all the time.
-You see what?

36:28.917 --> 36:33.541
Why did you tell your fiancé
You saved an lady? Exactly.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.791
You think you want to get married, but
you don't. You're pitiful, confused,

36:37.875 --> 36:41.958
looking to get some hot pepper.
-Mary, you have no idea what you're

36:42.042 --> 36:45.583
talking about.
-Why did you go to movies with me?

36:45.667 --> 36:49.833
Why did Steve go to the movies with
you? First, Steve likes the movies.

36:49.834 --> 36:53.999
Steve had the night off. Steve said,
you know what? A movie sounds good.

36:54.084 --> 36:58.124
Plus, he got an invitation.
-Why does Steve refer to himself

36:59.209 --> 37:01.708
in the third person?
-What are you talking about?

37:01.792 --> 37:05.874
You think you can double-talk your way
out of this? Throw me off your scent.

37:05.959 --> 37:09.124
I smell like sweet red plums...
-What?

37:09.209 --> 37:12.874
You said that before you passed out.
-I did not!

37:12.959 --> 37:16.916
It’s M-A-R-Y who looked to get some.
-You are hideous!

37:17.000 --> 37:20.541
Then why did you ask me to dance?
-I didn't!

37:20.625 --> 37:24.208
You did too! Up in the tree, you said,
Steve, would you like to dance?

37:24.292 --> 37:28.874
I’m not the one who is engaged!
-It was a dance!

37:29.500 --> 37:32.749
Whoop-tee-do,
it didn't mean anything.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.499
Then why did you almost kiss me?

37:37.875 --> 37:42.583
This lovely couple have it,
they know what it takes.

37:43.667 --> 37:45.708
Very well.

37:45.792 --> 37:48.916
We need to pow-wow.

37:52.667 --> 37:57.249
As Dad mentioned it, I went!
That is the place to get married!

37:57.334 --> 38:02.041
Sure, Fran, a vineyard sounds perfect.
You must get it out right away.

38:02.125 --> 38:06.916
I already have. For this weekend.
You're gonna have to take off Friday.

38:07.334 --> 38:11.583
Friday is not good for me. I have a
diverticulitis seminar I had planned.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.666
Saturday.
-Saturday?

38:13.750 --> 38:16.749
Saturday, alright.
-Mary? Thanks for everything.

38:17.667 --> 38:21.083
Nice to meet you. Thanks for dancing.
We'll let you know how it all goes.

38:21.167 --> 38:25.166
What? She is coming with us.
-I’m coming?

38:27.500 --> 38:30.374
You are not quitting the wedding!
-I’m going to tell Geri

38:30.459 --> 38:33.791
I’m off the account.
-There is only one good reason

38:34.292 --> 38:38.833
to quit a wedding and that is
if you break the cardinal rule which

38:38.917 --> 38:42.999
is ridiculous because we both know
that you did not fall in love

38:43.084 --> 38:47.541
with the groom! What?

38:48.834 --> 38:52.583
You didn't! Bad!
-No,

38:53.875 --> 38:57.958
of course not!
I never get emotionally.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.749
Never! Never!

39:03.000 --> 39:06.749
It’s the doctor.
-I’m confused. Is it the doctor

39:06.875 --> 39:10.749
or did you fall for the groom?
-The doctor is the groom!

39:10.834 --> 39:15.083
The groom is the doctor! The doctor
is Fran Donolly's fiancé!

39:15.167 --> 39:19.541
The dumpster girl plans your wedding?
-Yes! I’m in hell.

39:19.625 --> 39:23.708
I’m in heaven! Fix me up with her.
-I’m not fixing you up, Dr. John.

39:23.792 --> 39:27.666
This is complicated enough.
-You are one of the top

39:27.750 --> 39:32.333
wedding planners in this
great big thriving metropolis!

39:32.417 --> 39:36.499
Look on the positive side. He got you
to open up again. Thank the bastard

39:36.584 --> 39:40.458
and move on! You cannot tell me you
would sacrifice your career over this!

39:40.542 --> 39:44.124
You're not telling me that you think
it's a mistake to marry Fran now?

39:44.209 --> 39:49.416
I don't think it's a mistake
to marry Fran. Fran is great!

39:50.209 --> 39:53.333
It’s just that...

39:54.375 --> 39:59.208
What if what I think is great,
really is great...

39:59.292 --> 40:03.916
But it's not as great
as something greater.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.749
You will go through with this wedding!
Why?

40:07.750 --> 40:11.708
Because you deserve this partnership!
You've earned it!

40:11.792 --> 40:14.708
You're right.
-Of course, I’m right.

40:14.792 --> 40:18.874
Your feelings for her is not chemistry.
It is anxiety. It’s nature.

40:18.959 --> 40:20.958
It’s natural.
-Yes.

40:21.042 --> 40:25.958
Au naturale, it's anxiety.
-I can plan this wedding.

40:26.042 --> 40:30.083
The feelings I have for Fran run deep.
It’s not something that can be swept

40:30.167 --> 40:33.499
away in one night with one dance!
-Not gonna happen.

40:33.584 --> 40:38.333
What was I thinking? I was thinking
wrong. I was being a jackass.

40:38.417 --> 40:42.458
I can treat that jackass like
any other faceless groom.

40:42.542 --> 40:45.666
Yes! Why? Because he's nothing!

40:45.917 --> 40:50.083
Because I love a challenge!
Because I am a goddamn professional!

40:51.084 --> 40:55.249
You're gonna give me her number?
-No, I’m not.

41:00.542 --> 41:04.624
I thought we had everything covered
but then I realized

41:04.709 --> 41:08.791
Eddie and I don't have a wedding song.
I got this wedding compilation

41:08.875 --> 41:12.791
to see if we can find one.

41:20.459 --> 41:23.999
What do you think?
-That's groovy. I like it.

41:24.084 --> 41:27.208
Ok, what else?

41:31.417 --> 41:34.916
What do you think about this?
-It’s groovy too. I like it.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.583
It’s kind of cute. Kind of nice.

41:43.500 --> 41:48.166
Olivia Newton-John!
I love this song!

41:48.750 --> 41:53.916
This is perfect, isn't it?
-Yes, it is perfect.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.708
Ha.
-What?

41:56.959 --> 42:01.124
Nothing. It’s nothing.
-No, what? Is it a bad song?

42:01.250 --> 42:04.999
No, I think it's absolutely perfect.
-See, it's perfect.

42:05.084 --> 42:08.666
It’s perfect?
-Yes, it is. It’s perfect.

42:08.750 --> 42:13.083
I can't believe it, we have a song!

42:13.167 --> 42:16.416
I love you,
I honestly love you...

42:18.042 --> 42:21.166
What is that, like 1983?

42:22.625 --> 42:27.458
Mary, I’ve been meaning to ask you,
what happened to that guy?

42:27.542 --> 42:32.499
The one you danced with in the park?

42:32.959 --> 42:35.999
Oh, Eddie!
-There was a deer on the road.

42:36.084 --> 42:39.291
Did you see that? Damn it.

42:40.167 --> 42:42.624
Be careful.

42:43.125 --> 42:46.249
So, what happened?

42:47.834 --> 42:51.416
It didn't work out.
-How is that possible?

42:51.500 --> 42:57.083
I saw you 3days later and you still
had stars in your eyes.

42:58.375 --> 43:03.583
He turned out to be the groom of one
of the wedding I was planning.

43:04.584 --> 43:06.583
No!
-Yes.

43:06.667 --> 43:10.749
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard!

43:10.834 --> 43:14.749
I would hate to be single
with all those creeps out there.

43:14.834 --> 43:17.916
Yeah Fran, you're really lucky.

43:39.917 --> 43:42.666
They'd like to see the gardens first,
don't you think, Mary?

43:42.750 --> 43:46.499
There the ceremony would take place.
-Maria Fiore!

43:49.584 --> 43:53.124
What are you doing here?
-Your papa tell me where you are,

43:53.209 --> 43:57.958
so I come to surprise you.
I made this for you.

43:57.959 --> 44:01.499
Who is this?
-I’m her fiancé.

44:01.625 --> 44:04.708
What?
-You're her fiancé?

44:04.792 --> 44:07.833
Buongiorno, I am Massimo.
-I’m Steve.

44:07.917 --> 44:11.833
And I’m Fran.
-I cannot believe you didn't tell us,

44:11.917 --> 44:15.708
you were engaged.
-You're engaged!

44:15.792 --> 44:20.166
That's marvellous!
After all the weddings you've done,

44:20.250 --> 44:23.291
now it's your turn!
-And I’m the fiancé.

44:23.375 --> 44:27.583
Congratulations! We're going to have
to plan something very special.

44:27.667 --> 44:32.166
No, it won't be necessary.
-Yes, it will because it is wonderful.

44:32.250 --> 44:36.333
It is wonderful. You've found that
somebody special in your life,

44:36.417 --> 44:40.499
to be honest and faithful
till the end of time,

44:40.584 --> 44:45.791
forever, no matter what.
Let's take that moment, Mary.

44:47.250 --> 44:50.374
And I’m her fiancé.

44:52.584 --> 44:56.541
Bernard, we're ready for our tour now.
-Certainly. Follow me.

44:56.625 --> 45:00.208
Oh, man, wow!
-Steve, this wedding put-together

45:00.834 --> 45:04.916
is not the job for a man.
Stay with me

45:05.000 --> 45:09.083
and we will do the manly bonding.
-Manly bonding?

45:09.750 --> 45:12.958
Manly bonding.
-You and me. We'll let the ladies,

45:13.042 --> 45:18.249
I mean the brides-to-be
go do their thing.

45:20.417 --> 45:24.499
How cute is he? He's so cute.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.791
How long have you known Mary, buddy?
-Way before she had the breast.

45:29.875 --> 45:33.874
Back then, she did not look so good.

45:33.959 --> 45:37.708
Look,
a center for the physical fitness.

45:38.459 --> 45:43.083
We do the bonding. Follow me.
-We do the bonding.

45:58.792 --> 46:02.708
Take it easy there, buddy.
-I like to speed.

46:02.792 --> 46:06.874
You like to speed...
-Faster! Run!

46:16.417 --> 46:20.458
Run like a man! Like me!

46:22.500 --> 46:25.583
Here we are!
-Hello, sweetheart.

46:25.667 --> 46:29.583
Hi, bunny wedding woman.
-Hi.

46:29.750 --> 46:32.791
Hi.
-What took you guys so long?

46:32.875 --> 46:36.791
We found 7 of the most adorable
vineyards on the way up.

46:36.875 --> 46:40.458
By the side of the road.
-Yes! All you can drink!

46:40.542 --> 46:44.083
Honey, do you mind?
-How many is that for you?

46:44.167 --> 46:47.291
65. And you?
-How many?

46:47.750 --> 46:50.541
65.
-Same! 67!

46:53.959 --> 46:56.208
How many?

46:56.292 --> 47:01.458
Another plus is their chef rated one
of the 3 best on the west coast.

47:01.542 --> 47:05.624
I really like it, Dad.
You know who else was married here?

47:05.709 --> 47:09.249
Lesley Ann Martin.
-Herb Martin's daughter? Forget it!

47:09.334 --> 47:13.416
I’m not move in his shoddy footsteps.
-I didn't see a stage either.

47:13.500 --> 47:17.249
Find something bigger!
-Eddie, what on earth...

47:21.500 --> 47:26.249
What are you doing?
-Just a second...

47:28.834 --> 47:31.958
Good move, honey!

47:36.042 --> 47:40.291
From this valley,
they say you are leaving.

47:41.584 --> 47:45.249
No, it's "going".
-Whatever, darling.

47:45.334 --> 47:49.749
I shall miss your bright eyes
and sweet smile...

47:49.834 --> 47:52.958
Smile, smile, smile...

47:53.209 --> 47:57.291
I’m starting a non-profit pediatric
foundation. Want Eddie to head it up.

47:57.375 --> 48:02.499
Can you imagine, Eddie a C.E.O.?
-He wants to give up his patients?

48:02.667 --> 48:06.749
He does. He just doesn't know it yet.
He has a hard time

48:06.834 --> 48:10.958
leaving people behind.
Always do the right thing.

48:11.042 --> 48:14.583
I’m sure he doesn't always do
the right thing.

48:14.667 --> 48:18.833
Just as something
in the red river valley.

48:20.709 --> 48:25.458
Mom, would you please shut up!

48:26.125 --> 48:29.791
Heel, boy!

48:33.542 --> 48:35.624
Heel!

48:38.000 --> 48:41.124
Pull on the reigns!

48:43.459 --> 48:45.833
Horsey!

48:51.709 --> 48:54.833
Horsey! Oh God!

48:59.542 --> 49:01.999
Steve! Steve!
-Hang on, Mary!

49:07.584 --> 49:11.083
I got you, I got you!
-You got me?

49:16.042 --> 49:18.124
Stop!

49:18.792 --> 49:21.499
Ok?

49:30.084 --> 49:32.666
You ok?
-Yeah.

49:32.750 --> 49:34.833
Easy...

49:38.209 --> 49:42.749
Oh my God, you could've been killed!
-It’s important to learn how to ride!

49:42.834 --> 49:45.874
Yes.
-Eddie, you're riding back with Mary.

49:45.959 --> 49:49.499
No! No, really...
-Don't let her out of your sight!

49:49.584 --> 49:53.583
The good news is, I have the wine!

50:14.584 --> 50:17.916
Thank you for what you did.
-No problem.

50:19.167 --> 50:22.333
You don't have to be smug about it.

50:24.250 --> 50:27.458
How about a quick recap here, Mary?

50:27.542 --> 50:31.499
You harpooned me for being engaged

50:31.584 --> 50:35.666
when in a zippy and unexpected twist,
you yourself had a fiancé.

50:35.750 --> 50:40.208
You have the nerve to call me smug?
Mary, what the hell is your problem?

50:40.334 --> 50:43.374
You're the one with the problem!

50:43.750 --> 50:47.833
I’ve been doing this a long time.
I can predict, down to the week how

50:47.917 --> 50:51.999
long a couple is going to last. Are
you aware Fran has chosen teal for

50:52.084 --> 50:56.124
her bridesmaids? Teal the color of
gangrene. My last bride who chose teal

50:56.209 --> 51:00.374
got her marriage annulled in 12 days!

51:00.459 --> 51:04.374
And "I Honestly Love You" as your
wedding song? You might as well

51:04.459 --> 51:09.208
commit matrimonial suicide right now!
-You want a confession in blood?

51:09.334 --> 51:14.249
That night at the movie,
I was attracted to you.

51:14.334 --> 51:18.458
You caught me. I admit it.

51:18.542 --> 51:22.499
Maybe, I was a little unsure
about the marriage, I don't know.

51:22.584 --> 51:27.499
Maybe, I was just being guy
and an opportunity presented itself.

51:27.584 --> 51:31.708
Bottom line?
I never thought I’d see you again.

51:31.792 --> 51:35.541
Bottom line, nothing happened!

51:35.625 --> 51:39.541
Bottom line, now,
more than ever,

51:39.625 --> 51:42.958
I believe Fran is the one for me.

51:43.750 --> 51:47.833
So, I would say,
based on the evidence,

51:48.250 --> 51:52.374
all your theories on love sound
rantings of a bitter and cynical woman.

51:56.417 --> 52:00.583
Once I walked out on
the streets of Laredo.

52:02.167 --> 52:06.874
Come to the streets with me.

52:27.167 --> 52:32.208
That's a good boy.

52:52.625 --> 52:56.041
What is going on?
-I am measuring you

52:56.125 --> 52:59.916
for your wedding dress.
-I want my house key back then.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.208
Dad, please.
-Where is that old wedding dress?

53:05.750 --> 53:10.416
Now, we can finally get rid of this.
-Dad! Put that back!

53:10.709 --> 53:15.124
Mary, what do you want on your bagel?
-No bagel! No wedding dress!

53:15.209 --> 53:18.749
No wedding!
-No wedding?

53:18.834 --> 53:23.916
Massimo said you called an engagement.
-I never said that!

53:24.000 --> 53:27.791
This is like the blind date
that wouldn't end!

53:27.875 --> 53:33.083
He's right! You're frightened
by a mounting attraction for him.

53:33.709 --> 53:37.874
That's disgusting!
-I told you Missmo was full of crap.

53:37.959 --> 53:42.333
No a Missmo, Massimo! Please, go toast
the bagel. Mind your own business.

53:42.334 --> 53:47.083
I’ll toast it when I see fit. Missmo,
Massimo or any other kind of Mo...

53:47.167 --> 53:51.958
You cannot push some guy at me.
That's not how it works.

53:53.042 --> 53:55.791
You know that. You had Ma!
-Yes, and I didn't meet her

53:55.875 --> 54:00.624
until the day of our wedding.
-What are you talking about?

54:01.000 --> 54:05.499
Your mother and l
had an arranged marriage.

54:06.125 --> 54:09.249
An arranged marriage?

54:09.959 --> 54:14.083
We met on the day of our wedding,
we couldn't even look at each other.

54:15.625 --> 54:21.333
I was in love with another girl and
your mom wanted nothing to do with me.

54:22.417 --> 54:27.124
She said I had big eyebrows
and a low IQ.

54:27.125 --> 54:30.208
I got very sick,

54:31.292 --> 54:34.291
with scarlet fever...

54:35.209 --> 54:40.416
and she stayed by my side.
She took good care of me.

54:41.459 --> 54:45.291
For the first time, I appreciated her.

54:47.375 --> 54:50.874
The appreciation grew to respect.

54:51.292 --> 54:54.666
Respect grew to like.

54:55.209 --> 54:58.583
And like grew to love.

55:00.292 --> 55:04.624
A deeper love
than I could ever hope for.

55:06.959 --> 55:10.083
Give Massimo a chance.

55:10.709 --> 55:16.624
Maybe, you don't like him now.
But you might love him later.

55:16.709 --> 55:21.624
I should have told you about
your mother and I a long time ago.

55:21.709 --> 55:27.124
Maybe, then you'd feel differently
about love.

55:28.792 --> 55:33.166
I don't feel anything about love.

55:36.792 --> 55:39.916
What do you think, Mary?

55:40.875 --> 55:44.791
The park is great.
You would be the first.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.249
No one has ever been married
here before.

55:51.750 --> 55:55.833
We'd have to construct the site from
scratch but at least you wouldn't

55:55.917 --> 56:01.041
have to cut the guest list.
-Dad would love it.

56:01.459 --> 56:05.416
And the bride and groom-to-be?
-Let's take it.

56:05.500 --> 56:08.541
We should keep looking.

56:08.625 --> 56:11.749
Maybe,
I should give you guys a minute.

56:12.459 --> 56:15.708
You don't like it?
-You like it?

56:16.084 --> 56:19.416
I don't know, I mean,

56:20.417 --> 56:23.541
don't you...

56:24.125 --> 56:27.833
Alright, if this is what you want,

56:27.917 --> 56:31.249
then I’m fine with it.

56:31.334 --> 56:36.124
Do you see why I’m marrying this guy?
Because he is so good to me.

56:37.209 --> 56:41.166
You two will have no problem planning
the wedding while I’m gone.

56:41.250 --> 56:43.499
Pardon?
-Just for a week.

56:43.584 --> 56:45.874
Gone?
-Back East.

56:45.959 --> 56:50.041
Buying out a few of our manufacturers.
-Fran, this is a really critical time.

56:50.125 --> 56:54.749
I know. That's why we shouldn't lose
momentum. You'll do your job. I trust.

56:58.042 --> 57:02.124
Fran wants statues.
-A well-chosen sculpture

57:02.209 --> 57:06.333
can help enhance the tone and theme
of the ceremony.

57:06.417 --> 57:10.499
Something like this could be nice.
-Depressing, isn't it?

57:10.584 --> 57:14.749
No. It’s wistful and romantic.

57:20.750 --> 57:25.249
I always pictured a small wedding
myself. Close friends and family

57:25.250 --> 57:30.458
on a beach somewhere...
cool salty breeze.

57:32.167 --> 57:37.166
The Aphrodite might be perfect.
-What about this guy?

57:37.250 --> 57:41.166
This is all wrong for a wedding.
It’s too menacing.

57:41.250 --> 57:46.458
I think you're wrong.
He's not menacing. He's masculine.

57:47.459 --> 57:51.124
He's the protector.
This man is strong.

57:51.375 --> 57:54.416
He's naked.
-This man is sturdy.

57:54.500 --> 57:58.458
Pick him up before somebody sees it!

57:58.542 --> 58:02.749
Are you alright? Yes...
I got him. The man is heavy!

58:04.084 --> 58:08.958
My God, there's a guard coming!

58:10.209 --> 58:13.708
Oh my God! You castrated him!

58:14.000 --> 58:17.833
Oh, no!
-The guard is coming!

58:17.917 --> 58:21.958
I’m sorry, buddy.
-Lot of work here! We gotta fix him!

58:22.042 --> 58:26.124
Whaddya got? Of course, Krazy Glue...

58:26.209 --> 58:30.166
Why didn't I bring Krazy Glue
in case his pecker fell off.

58:30.250 --> 58:33.833
Hanging right there.
-You got it?

58:33.917 --> 58:37.999
He's on. I got it. Oh shit! Steve is
Stuck... glued to it by his finger.

58:38.084 --> 58:41.416
Sir, touching the statues
isn't permitted.

58:42.209 --> 58:46.249
You're right, it's limestone,
not granite. We got a bet going

58:46.334 --> 58:51.124
on what he was made out of.
-Your hand, sir?

58:56.167 --> 58:59.374
Yeah, my hand... Here it is.

59:01.292 --> 59:03.999
Limestone penis.

59:04.542 --> 59:08.124
You'd think it'd be bigger.

59:14.042 --> 59:17.166
What else you got in there?

59:18.167 --> 59:21.583
My entire universe.

59:28.292 --> 59:31.333
I’m sorry...
-I’m sorry, go ahead.

59:31.417 --> 59:34.958
No, you go.
-I’m sorry about Napa.

59:35.042 --> 59:40.041
I didn't mean to call you
bitter and cynical. You're not.

59:40.125 --> 59:44.208
I’m sorry about what I said
about your marriage

59:44.292 --> 59:48.166
being to failure.
-I apologize for saying

59:48.250 --> 59:52.458
you were just an opportunity.
That was pretty ugly of me.

59:52.542 --> 59:57.874
I was only half serious
about the teal bridesmaid thing.

59:57.959 --> 01:00:01.624
At least I have a fifty-fifty chance.

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:05.666
You're going to be real happy together.
-So are you and Massimo.

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:10.791
It’s gonna work.

01:00:11.334 --> 01:00:13.999
We're not engaged anymore.

01:00:15.292 --> 01:00:17.916
Really?
-Really.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.499
Are you ok with that?
-Yeah.

01:00:22.334 --> 01:00:27.166
It was more my Dad
trying to get us together.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:30.416
Whaddya mean?
Why would he wanna do that?

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:38.666
Maybe because he was
so happy with my Mom.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.916
Fran said to go ahead with Violet...
-The chocolate one?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.291
The one you suggested.
-Good. I’ll put in that order today.

01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:03.749
How is Fran?
-She's good.

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:07.916
She's making deals,
kicking butt, being Fran.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.374
Nicely done.

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:18.541
Thank you, Mary.
-You're welcome.

01:01:18.834 --> 01:01:21.666
You wanna keep it?
-Sure...

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:31.999
It’s a nice day.

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:36.749
I agree with you
about the small wedding.

01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:40.041
That's the way I’d do it too.

01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:50.416
Papa?

01:01:53.834 --> 01:01:57.499
How nice to see you.

01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:03.874
Where's my father?
-Buying balloons for Burt's birthday.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:08.458
Tell him I was here.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:13.624
Are you mad with me?
-Yes, I’m mad at you.

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:18.208
You told my father we were engaged.
He tried to measure me

01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:22.374
for a wedding dress! What is the
matter with you? You never listen!

01:02:22.459 --> 01:02:26.541
Massimo, we are not going to be
together like that!

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:30.708
What are you doing here?
-I am sorry! I will leave you alone!

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:35.666
No, from now on I will no longer
bother you! We will be just friends.

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:39.833
You think we can be friends?
-I want to apologize for any madness

01:02:39.834 --> 01:02:43.416
I caused you.
-Is this a trick?

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.583
No tricks. I’m very serious.
I just want for us to be...

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:51.041
buddy-buddy. I promise it.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.416
Do you have plans for dinner?
-Massimo!

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.749
No, as a friend I want to make for you
a wonderful American dish.

01:03:00.834 --> 01:03:04.416
Sit, I will start.

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:11.999
That's it? Instant cheese macaroni?
-It is a low-budget wonder.

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:16.624
Already today, I’ve eaten 3 boxes.
-Nothing like a

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:19.833
well-balanced diet.

01:03:32.167 --> 01:03:36.249
You remind me so much of your mother.
-You don't remember my mother.

01:03:36.334 --> 01:03:40.666
I remember your mother.
She had the same big smile

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:45.249
and the same dark hair.
She had no nail on her little finger.

01:03:45.334 --> 01:03:48.416
I don't remember why.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.999
A brick fell on it when she
was little. It never grew back.

01:03:53.084 --> 01:03:57.749
We have much history together.
-We sort of do.

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:08.374
You have much on your mind?
-Not at all.

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:13.666
We're friends and friends listen when
their friends are not feeling good so,

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:17.249
please, do tell me.

01:04:19.834 --> 01:04:23.749
There's nothing to tell.
I thought I could control everything

01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:28.958
and I can't.
I met someone who I thought he was,

01:04:29.042 --> 01:04:32.166
but was he's not.

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:39.874
Did you ever like somebody
but the timing was off?

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:44.916
Way off. You feel things
that you should no be feeling.

01:04:49.459 --> 01:04:52.833
I’m not making any sense.

01:04:53.042 --> 01:04:56.541
You make much sense.

01:04:57.334 --> 01:05:01.291
You long for him
the way I long for you.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:10.249
I don't want you to think...
-I want to tell you something.

01:05:10.334 --> 01:05:13.749
You need to learn patience.

01:05:13.959 --> 01:05:18.999
Love can't always be perfect.
Love is just love.

01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:28.583
My Mom used to say that.
-Your mother was a very wise woman.

01:05:43.542 --> 01:05:47.624
We'll start with Camellias as a base.
That's what Fran and I discussed.

01:05:47.709 --> 01:05:52.458
Anything else that jumps out at you,
let me know.

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:57.083
Roses, wreaths...
We don't need any more statues.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.124
How about this beauty?
-Interesting.

01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:07.416
This is called a Bleeding Heart,
the official funeral flower of Tibet.

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:12.333
I knew I’d be good at this.
We'll take some

01:06:12.334 --> 01:06:16.208
Slit-My-Wrists Susans
and we'll be ready.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:22.583
How did you meet?
-Me and Fran?

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:26.291
College.
-In one of your classes?

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:30.041
No, she was a bookie.
-Fran was a bookie?

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:34.208
She single-handedly established
this underground gambling ring

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:38.374
at UC Berkeley. Took bets on every
sporting event, ran numbers and hosted

01:06:38.459 --> 01:06:41.791
a Vegas night at a sorority house.
-You're lying.

01:06:41.875 --> 01:06:46.374
That's Fran. Orchids? Does that work?
-Orchids will work, definitely.

01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:51.249
She was the coolest.
I was the bookworm.

01:06:51.334 --> 01:06:55.249
She was the wild child
and she picked me.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:02.624
How about cabbage?
-Oh, god!

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:05.916
What's the matter?
-Just hide me!

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.208
Mary, what are you doing?
-Don't say my name!

01:07:16.459 --> 01:07:19.583
Mary?

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:27.083
Hi.
-Hi.

01:07:28.834 --> 01:07:31.583
Are you ok?
-Yeah, I found it.

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:38.458
How are you doing? I’m Steven Edison.
-Keith Richmond.

01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:41.583
My wife, Wendy.

01:07:41.667 --> 01:07:45.333
Nice to meet you, Wendy.
How do you all know each other?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.083
We go way back. It’s a long story.
-Let me tell it. It’s really

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:55.333
a funny story.
See, Keith was my fiancé.

01:07:55.417 --> 01:07:59.499
Wendy was his high-school girlfriend.
On the night

01:07:59.584 --> 01:08:03.249
of our rehearsal dinner, I found them
making out in my car!

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:12.958
That covers a lot of points.
Did I leave anything out?

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:27.499
You want to go up?

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:39.957
You ok?
-Jezebel was the only queen

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:44.791
in the bible to be eaten by dogs.
-Did she fall down?

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:57.041
Mister and Misses Wilfred Perper.
-No, it's not that one.

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:01.874
Nancy Pong...

01:09:07.459 --> 01:09:11.207
Who is it?
-Nancy Pong? 2-C?

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:17.124
Nancy, would you buzz us in, please?
-It’s Mary Fiore... 7 H!

01:09:17.292 --> 01:09:21.332
Who?
-You don't know me. We haven't met

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:29.916
because I’m a control freak
and I don't have time for people.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.624
lf you ever need to borrow
a cup of sugar,

01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:38.832
I can't help you

01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:43.041
because I don't have time to shop!

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:56.374
I want to go home.
-We are home.

01:09:57.667 --> 01:10:00.791
We're down on the porch.

01:10:03.542 --> 01:10:06.666
He's married

01:10:07.292 --> 01:10:10.499
and they're gonna have a baby.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:14.791
He looked good.
-No, no.

01:10:16.209 --> 01:10:18.499
He didn't.

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:23.749
Hold it, please? Thank you.

01:10:24.292 --> 01:10:27.333
We're in.
-I don't know him.

01:10:27.417 --> 01:10:31.499
I know this guy.
He's gonna hold the door open.

01:10:31.584 --> 01:10:36.416
You got your beer. Here we go...
We got you. We got you purse.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.333
We got your keys. Somebody...

01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:44.791
who lives in the same building, thanks.
-Do you know Nancy Pong?

01:10:59.625 --> 01:11:03.708
You want it well or medium well.
-You really don't think

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:08.166
he looked good?
-No, he looked old.

01:11:08.292 --> 01:11:12.374
Kind of happy and fat.
He put on

01:11:12.459 --> 01:11:15.583
a couple of pounds.
-Be quiet.

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:25.374
He said they were just friends.
Deep down I knew friends.

01:11:25.459 --> 01:11:28.583
Deep down I knew better.

01:11:34.167 --> 01:11:37.291
I was just a stand-in,

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:40.666
a poor man's Wendy.

01:11:44.292 --> 01:11:48.374
Do you know she threw my bridal
shower for me? She even froze

01:11:48.459 --> 01:11:52.541
mint leaves and raspberries in the
ice cubes. That should have

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:57.374
tipped me off right there.
She was trying too hard.

01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:03.083
Jerk!

01:12:06.875 --> 01:12:11.124
It’s a good thing I didn't marry him.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.124
But most of the time I think,

01:12:22.459 --> 01:12:25.583
I just wasn't enough.

01:12:26.792 --> 01:12:28.874
No,

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:33.416
no, you're wrong.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.083
Hey!

01:12:39.584 --> 01:12:42.708
And another thing,

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:47.874
this Wendy, she's nothing
but a poor man's Mary.

01:12:52.875 --> 01:12:54.958
Really.

01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:23.166
It’s getting late.

01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:30.083
I better go.

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:38.166
I’ll walk you to the door.
-That's alright. Stay down.

01:13:38.292 --> 01:13:42.291
No, it's ok.
-Take your time.

01:13:42.959 --> 01:13:45.166
You alright?

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:53.874
Thanks for tonight.
I know I was a mess.

01:13:53.959 --> 01:13:59.166
No, you weren't. Maybe.
A little bit of a mess.

01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:04.499
Shut up!
-Are you going to be ok?

01:14:05.125 --> 01:14:09.041
2 aspirin and a lot of water.
Sleep, and a beer in the morning.

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:11.249
That's the cure.

01:14:11.334 --> 01:14:14.458
Good-night, Mary.
-Good-night.

01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:50.999
Yes?
-Do you think about the night at park?

01:14:51.084 --> 01:14:53.166
What?

01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:55.499
Ok.

01:14:56.542 --> 01:15:00.624
I barely know you.
I don't know your dad's first name.

01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:05.916
I don't know if you ever wore
braces or contacts or glasses...

01:15:07.084 --> 01:15:12.041
I have no idea how you came
to be a wedding planner, Mary.

01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:19.666
But I know the curves of your face.

01:15:21.834 --> 01:15:25.333
I know every fleck of gold
in your eyes.

01:15:29.834 --> 01:15:33.166
I know that night in the park,

01:15:35.334 --> 01:15:38.583
it was the best time I’ve ever had.

01:15:51.459 --> 01:15:54.583
Please say something.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.416
I’m a magnet for unavailable men.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:05.374
And I’m sick of it.

01:16:08.834 --> 01:16:10.916
It’s simple.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:15.458
I know Fran. I respect her.

01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:22.749
And she loves you.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:29.916
So, besides your tux measurements,

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:33.041
that's all I need to know.

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:42.249
Please go away.

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:51.499
Good-night, Mary.

01:17:11.917 --> 01:17:15.916
How to word an invitation where both
parents pay the wedding? The groom is

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.874
a military, will get a medical degree
and the bride is a young widow

01:17:19.959 --> 01:17:24.041
whose father just had a sex change
operation and now goes by the name,

01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:28.249
Sugarpie DeSanto. Mary?
-What is it?

01:17:28.334 --> 01:17:31.749
A little tense?
-No, just terribly...

01:17:32.459 --> 01:17:35.583
terribly alert!

01:17:37.334 --> 01:17:40.458
Fran? What's the matter?

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:43.749
I came back early.

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:49.833
Why? Is everything ok?
-I’ve discovered something.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:55.374
I’ve been blind.
I didn't want to see it.

01:17:55.459 --> 01:17:59.208
I tried to ignore the signs.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:03.833
You know what I’m talking about.
-Let me explain.

01:18:03.917 --> 01:18:08.083
It’s not what you think.
-Yes, it is.

01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:13.041
I can't go through with this wedding.
-Fran...

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:17.416
I was in a meeting talking about
Boccolino Mozzarella

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.666
and it hit me that
this isn't going to work.

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:25.666
I can't stand the way he chews
on pen caps or the songs

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:29.624
he sings in the shower.
It drives me nuts the way he hikes up

01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:34.916
his left pant leg
after he's eaten too much.

01:18:35.542 --> 01:18:40.749
Is Eddie gonna be the last man
I sleep with? Ever?

01:18:42.334 --> 01:18:47.541
I’ve been with him so long, I don't
know why we're together anymore.

01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:58.166
Look at me.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:02.374
You are exquisite.

01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:09.124
You're timeless. You have the love
of a man named Steve.

01:19:11.834 --> 01:19:17.041
A man who while you were away having
meetings about mozzarella, said to me:

01:19:17.959 --> 01:19:21.624
I can't believe she picked me.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:28.499
I can't believe I’m marrying the most
incredible woman I’ve ever met.

01:19:33.542 --> 01:19:37.958
That tells me this marriage of yours

01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:41.249
is not only gonna work,

01:19:42.542 --> 01:19:46.041
it's gonna last forever.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:49.208
Really?

01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.958
Really.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:58.124
Thank you.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.791
For he's a Jolly good fellow,
for he's a Jolly good fellow,

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:13.374
for he's a Jolly good fellow,
which nobody can deny!

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:18.041
Let me pray,
I love you, bless everyone.

01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:30.874
I hope he didn't spit on the cake.

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:34.124
Open up your presents!

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:38.374
Everyone! I want to make some toast.

01:20:40.167 --> 01:20:43.749
Happy Birthday, Burt.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:50.874
I want to thank Salvatore
for taking me into his life

01:20:50.959 --> 01:20:55.374
and introducing me
to all you wonderful people.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.124
One moment...

01:21:35.042 --> 01:21:39.541
I know I never done the right thing,
say the right thing

01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:42.624
and I act like a fool.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:50.458
I know I say we're just buddy-buddy
friends but that would not be true

01:21:50.542 --> 01:21:53.749
to my heart.

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:57.666
So, I will ask you this one question

01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:02.958
and if your answer is no then I will
leave you alone, once and for all.

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:12.416
Be my wife, Mary Fiore.

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:17.833
I will take care of you,
be true to you

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.791
and like this house I built
for your dolls, I will make sure

01:22:23.875 --> 01:22:29.083
you have a strong roof over your head.
lf your answer is yes,

01:22:29.792 --> 01:22:34.999
then no one will love you
as much as I love you.

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:38.374
lf your answer is yes

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:42.666
you will make me
the happiest man on the earth.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.708
What should I do without you?
-Wedding woman, you did some job.

01:25:34.792 --> 01:25:37.624
My girl is gonna knock them dead!

01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:42.916
Somebody stole my lucky mike.
I can't sing without it.

01:26:20.667 --> 01:26:24.666
What are you doing here? You know,
it's bad luck to see the bride

01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:28.666
before the wedding.

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:33.166
You look beautiful.
-Get out of here.

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:36.499
We're starting any minute. Go on!

01:26:37.542 --> 01:26:40.749
Let's take a walk.
-A walk?

01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:44.333
A walk. Come on.

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:50.458
You can't give the whole wedding to me!
-Everything is going to be fine.

01:26:50.542 --> 01:26:54.124
It’s a no-brainer.
-You can't do this! Geri is out there!

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:57.708
So? The whole commission is yours.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.083
More money than I make in a year.
-That means we're going to have

01:27:03.167 --> 01:27:06.333
to go shopping next week.

01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:10.958
I am completely confused.
Why are you doing this?

01:27:11.084 --> 01:27:14.833
There's somewhere I’ve gotta be.
-Ok, we can talk

01:27:14.917 --> 01:27:19.083
after the wedding.
-Hang on a minute, Fran.

01:27:20.667 --> 01:27:23.791
Why do you want to marry me?

01:27:23.959 --> 01:27:27.333
What?
-That question I need answered.

01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:33.374
Steve, you're scaring me.
-You never call me Steve.

01:27:33.459 --> 01:27:39.208
Because you don't like it.
-I never said I didn't like it.

01:27:41.917 --> 01:27:46.541
Where is this going?
-Why do you want to marry me?

01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:50.708
Are you kidding me?
-No, I’m not.

01:27:51.084 --> 01:27:54.916
You're trying to dump me
on the day of my wedding!

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.749
I just want an answer.
-No, this is not...

01:27:58.834 --> 01:28:01.874
No, Franny...
-Don't "Franny" me!

01:28:01.959 --> 01:28:05.499
You selfish bastard!
-The reasons we were together

01:28:05.584 --> 01:28:08.499
in college don't hold up anymore!
We're different people now.

01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:12.833
I think you know that.

01:28:12.917 --> 01:28:17.333
Listen, Franny, if you really love me
I’ll put on this and walk up that hill

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:21.499
to the big tent and do it.
-You would do that?

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:24.708
Yes, I would.

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:31.666
All those people...
-You don't know half of them.

01:28:32.042 --> 01:28:34.124
You and me.

01:28:35.792 --> 01:28:37.874
Are you ready?

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.291
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:28:46.917 --> 01:28:50.041
I just need a second.

01:28:56.834 --> 01:28:58.916
Oh God!

01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:18.791
No.

01:29:20.292 --> 01:29:23.083
I don't want to get married.

01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:18.541
How did we let it get this far?

01:30:19.417 --> 01:30:22.666
I don't know.
-What are we going to do?

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:31.458
That's the beauty of it...
whatever we want.

01:30:34.625 --> 01:30:38.874
I haven't thought about what l
really want in so long.

01:30:38.959 --> 01:30:41.041
Me neither.

01:30:48.459 --> 01:30:51.583
There you go.

01:30:57.209 --> 01:30:59.291
Ok?

01:30:59.709 --> 01:31:01.791
Ok.

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:17.249
That is the bride!
-Yes, it is.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:21.083
Is she coming back?
-No.

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:25.708
All the blood is rushing to my head
and I’m going to faint. I’m going to

01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:30.124
kill Mary for leaving me all alone!
I don't know what to do.

01:31:30.209 --> 01:31:34.374
Take a breath.
What are you talking about?

01:31:34.459 --> 01:31:38.541
I’m talking about your wedding planner
leaving me here alone

01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:42.208
to go to city hall and getting married!
-Married? You mean,

01:31:42.292 --> 01:31:46.083
Mary is getting married?
-Yeah. You know, married?

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:49.916
She can't get married! City hall!

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.124
Married, like you're supposed
to be doing! That's good.

01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:57.708
Beautiful.

01:32:05.792 --> 01:32:08.916
You're so beautiful.
-Thanks.

01:32:42.209 --> 01:32:47.083
Come on! God-damn it! Are you sure
you don't know a shortcut?

01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:51.833
Take a shortcut somewhere?
-We used to...

01:32:51.917 --> 01:32:54.124
Oh shit!

01:32:56.375 --> 01:32:59.874
Alright, on we go!

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:13.458
We are gathered in the presence
of there witnesses to join

01:33:13.542 --> 01:33:17.708
this man and this woman in matrimony.

01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:23.458
This contract is not to be taken
lightly, but thoughtfully and

01:33:24.917 --> 01:33:30.124
seriously with a deep realization of
its obligations and responsibilities.

01:33:31.625 --> 01:33:35.708
lf anyone can show just cause why
these two should not be joined

01:33:35.792 --> 01:33:40.999
together in matrimony, then let him
speak now or forever hold his peace.

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:50.916
Fine! Then let us proceed.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.583
No, no!
-Thank God!

01:33:54.667 --> 01:33:57.749
I object too.
-What is going on here?

01:34:05.667 --> 01:34:09.708
I look in your eyes
and it hurts my insides.

01:34:09.792 --> 01:34:13.708
This is not what you want,
this is what I want.

01:34:13.792 --> 01:34:17.708
Shame on me!
-I’m so lucky to have a Dad like you.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:24.708
But you're right. Love isn't like
some enchanted evening,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.166
isn't a fairy tale.
Or even love at first sight.

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:34.666
That isn't real life.

01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:40.499
Massimo is a good man.
Don't worry, Papa.

01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:44.333
I know what I’m doing.

01:34:45.459 --> 01:34:48.749
I’m just all grown up now.

01:35:05.667 --> 01:35:07.916
You know the doctor?
-Mary? Where's Mary?

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.916
I’m her father. Who are you?
-I’m Steve the doctor.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.041
I’m in love with your daughter.
-You are the one?

01:35:15.125 --> 01:35:18.999
I’m sorry, but I am!
-What about Fran?

01:35:19.084 --> 01:35:22.374
Not get married.
-Happening a lot today.

01:35:22.459 --> 01:35:26.291
You didn't get married?
-We're not married. I am not the one.

01:35:26.375 --> 01:35:29.916
You are the one, Steve.
-She's not married?

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.499
She does not love me.
She loves you, Steve.

01:35:34.417 --> 01:35:38.916
I could never forgive myself if I got
in the way of Mary's true love.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.458
Who the hell are you?
-Steve.

01:35:41.542 --> 01:35:44.583
He's Steve. He's the one!
-I’m the doctor.

01:35:44.667 --> 01:35:48.499
Hold the phone! You mean to tell me,

01:35:48.584 --> 01:35:52.708
you love her and she loves you and
neither of you got married today?

01:35:52.792 --> 01:35:56.374
Yes! That's what I’m saying.
-What the hell are you doing standing

01:35:56.459 --> 01:36:00.333
around talking to us for?
-I don't know. Where is she?

01:36:00.417 --> 01:36:03.458
Somebody take me to Mary!
-I like him!

01:36:03.542 --> 01:36:05.583
And he's a doctor.

01:36:48.459 --> 01:36:51.499
Thank you, Massimo.
-You better be good to her!

01:36:51.584 --> 01:36:56.249
Don't worry!
-I still do more chin-ups than you.

01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:26.916
Why are you only eating
the brown ones?

01:37:35.667 --> 01:37:38.874
Because someone once said that

01:37:38.959 --> 01:37:44.166
they had less artificial coloring
because chocolate is already brown.

01:37:47.917 --> 01:37:51.249
And it kind of stayed with me.

01:37:56.042 --> 01:37:59.291
You kind of stayed with me.

01:38:07.542 --> 01:38:10.833
Where's Fran?
-She's in Tahiti,

01:38:12.959 --> 01:38:16.083
on our honeymoon.

01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:20.541
We didn't get married.

01:38:24.125 --> 01:38:26.208
Because?

01:38:27.834 --> 01:38:31.499
Cause she needs to find
her own life.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.916
And l...
-You what?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.291
What does Steve want?
-I want to dance.

01:38:54.334 --> 01:38:56.374
With you.
