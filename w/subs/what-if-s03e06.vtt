00:30.583 --> 00:31.707
How many was that?

00:31.708 --> 00:34.415
That was nine. One left.

00:34.416 --> 00:37.249
You sure? I thought I counted eight.

00:37.250 --> 00:39.833

You rang?

01:26.083 --> 01:27.457
Nice of you to show up.

01:27.458 --> 01:30.499
Although, it will be the last mistake
you ever make.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.791
Mistake?

01:33.125 --> 01:35.875
Hey, Hawkeye, when's the last time
you missed your mark?

01:36.583 --> 01:37.583
[Kate] Can't recall.

01:38.583 --> 01:41.416
But it sounds like these folks
could use a demonstration.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.457
Let's get her done.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.332
Mind if I take my hat off first?

02:41.958 --> 02:43.624
- [grunts]
- Don't get cute.

02:43.625 --> 02:46.499
The Hood's been ransacking
construction sites all across the West.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.040
And abducting all the workers
building the rail lines.

02:49.041 --> 02:52.207
Eh, what do I care about a bunch
of missing Chinese immigrants?

02:52.208 --> 02:53.832
All right. Argh. All right.

02:53.833 --> 02:56.249
The Hood's headed towards Point Pegasus.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.915
But I wouldn't fret.

02:57.916 --> 03:01.249
Because in due time,
the Hood comes for everybody.

03:01.250 --> 03:05.207

03:32.000 --> 03:33.541
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

03:38.500 --> 03:42.916
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

04:14.041 --> 04:15.041
<i>"What If?"</i>

04:21.500 --> 04:24.832
Alternate realities, parallel universes.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.665
You get it at this point.

04:26.666 --> 04:30.165
Small choices, big changes, etcetera.

04:30.166 --> 04:32.832
But, out in the farthest reaches
of the Multiverse,

04:32.833 --> 04:35.333
well, things can get a little weird.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.624
Here, anything is possible.

04:39.625 --> 04:41.291
Really. Anything.

04:42.750 --> 04:46.708

04:47.791 --> 04:52.583
<i>In this universe, Ultron

But even in the Multiverse's
most far-out worlds,

04:56.625 --> 04:59.457
one thing sadly remains a constant.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.915
Injustice.

05:00.916 --> 05:03.583
Shang-Chi's universe was no exception.

05:04.166 --> 05:07.999
<i>Looking to escape the shadow
of her father's tyranny, in this universe,</i>

05:08.000 --> 05:10.332
<i>Shang-Chi's sister, Xu Xialing,</i>

05:10.333 --> 05:14.165
<i>immigrated to the United States
in the late 1860s,</i>

05:14.166 --> 05:18.791
<i>only to discover the American Dream
was not what she'd been promised.</i>

05:19.708 --> 05:21.665
<i>Immigrants had become targets,</i>

05:21.666 --> 05:25.082
<i>thanks to a mysterious crime lord
known as the Hood,</i>

05:25.083 --> 05:27.124
<i>who realized he could cement his power</i>

05:27.125 --> 05:30.083
<i>by preying on the locals' fear
of their new neighbors.</i>

05:31.416 --> 05:34.624
<i>But when Xialing
saw this injustice firsthand,</i>

05:34.625 --> 05:38.041
<i>she alone sought out the Hood
and fought back.</i>

05:39.041 --> 05:40.916
<i>Only never to be heard from again.</i>

05:42.333 --> 05:46.415
<i>And when rumor spread the Hood had taken
Xialing and her neighbors hostage,</i>

05:46.416 --> 05:48.457
<i>no one cared to look for them.</i>

05:48.458 --> 05:50.458
<i>Except Shang-Chi.</i>

05:51.666 --> 05:54.165
<i>Desperate to find his missing sister,</i>

05:54.166 --> 05:56.250
<i>he joined forces with Kate Bishop,</i>

05:57.250 --> 06:00.332
<i>a sharpshooter with her own bad blood

06:00.333 --> 06:03.540
<i>Together, they became a frontier fable.</i>

06:03.541 --> 06:07.833
<i>But this tall tale was starting to sound
more like a ghost story.</i>

06:23.833 --> 06:25.416
[Shang-Chi] Walker's tip was good.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.375
- But we're still too late. Again.
- [horse neighs]

06:30.500 --> 06:33.915
Ah, as if working the rail lines
isn't torture enough.

06:33.916 --> 06:37.999
[Kate] The Hood left my family's homestead
the same way after he got through with it.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.624
No survivors.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.749
And no trail left to track.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.665
We're getting closer.
We'll find him, Kate.

06:44.666 --> 06:45.749
And when we do,

06:45.750 --> 06:48.582
I'm gonna put him
dead in the ground myself.

06:48.583 --> 06:52.541
Not before he tells me
where my sister is first. All right?

06:53.083 --> 06:54.082
[boy] Help.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.166
Help.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.499
No way.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.082
[breathing deeply]

06:59.083 --> 07:00.166
You okay, kid?

07:01.041 --> 07:02.249
Here, have some of this.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.457
[gulping]

07:03.458 --> 07:05.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay. Slow down.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.875
- You got a name?
- Jun-Fan.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.707
Well, all right, Jun-Fan.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.624
Do you think you can tell us
what happened?

07:12.625 --> 07:16.500
I tried to ring the bell to call you,
but the Hood was too fast.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.124
It's all right. We're here now.

07:19.125 --> 07:22.083
We can help,
but you gotta tell us what you saw.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.750
It started like any other night.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.457
<i>Dad telling your stories,</i>

07:27.458 --> 07:30.332
<i>The Legend of Hawkeye and the Ten Rings.</i>

The frontier heroes who fight
for those who can't fight for themselves.

07:35.291 --> 07:36.541
Until the Hood appeared.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.249
<i>He whipped in out of nowhere,</i>

07:39.250 --> 07:41.916
<i>like a chill in the air.</i>

07:42.541 --> 07:45.666
<i>And took everyone away on a Ghost Train.</i>

07:49.333 --> 07:50.374
A "Ghost Train"?

07:50.375 --> 07:53.125
Yeah, a Ghost Train. It went that way.

07:54.083 --> 07:57.249
How did it head into the valley?
There's no track.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.375
I saw it with my own two eyes.
You gotta believe me!

08:06.291 --> 08:08.666
Please, Shang-Chi. He took my dad.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.500
[sighs] I shouldn't have hid.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.749
You did good, kid.
We'll take it from here.

08:21.750 --> 08:24.999
No! I'm coming with you.
I want to teach the Hood a lesson myself.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.082
Hey, now, hang on--

08:26.083 --> 08:27.416
[in Mandarin]

08:31.000 --> 08:33.290
[in English] All right. Now, that last one
was actually pretty good.

08:33.291 --> 08:34.375
[Kate] Hey, check it.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.875
There's a faint trail
running along the desert floor.

08:38.541 --> 08:40.665
Looks like it leads
straight into the valleys,

08:40.666 --> 08:42.083
in the Fury Flats.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.166
[Shang-Chi] Just like the kid said.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.290
They've got a mean head start.

08:46.291 --> 08:49.124
But if we ride the stagecoach route
over the mountains...

08:49.125 --> 08:51.207
We'll head them off at the pass.

08:51.208 --> 08:54.208
What do you think, Jun-Fan?
Up for an adventure?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.125

09:32.916 --> 09:33.957
[Jun-Fan] Did we make it?

09:33.958 --> 09:36.499
Don't know, kid. We've just gotta wait.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.000
And hope we didn't miss it.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.041
Please, let us be in time.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.125
[Shang-Chi] Come out, wherever you are.

10:02.708 --> 10:03.833
[train horn tooting]

10:05.041 --> 10:06.040
There it is!

10:06.041 --> 10:08.416
Hah. Well, I'll be.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.707
That's our Ghost Train. Let's move! Hyah!

10:13.708 --> 10:14.790
[Kate] Hyah!

10:14.791 --> 10:16.582
[galloping]

10:16.583 --> 10:18.582
Come on. Come on!

10:18.583 --> 10:20.291
[rumbling]

10:21.625 --> 10:22.625
[Shang-Chi] Hyah!

10:25.791 --> 10:26.790
[grunts]

10:26.791 --> 10:27.875
Let's go!

10:28.791 --> 10:31.790
Don't worry.
Kate's got some serious forearm strength.

10:31.791 --> 10:32.875
You got this, kid.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.791
- Whoa!
- I got ya.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.458
Nice one, kid.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.625
What in tarnation?

10:40.666 --> 10:43.041
Don't stray too far, will you, Morris?
[grunts]

10:44.333 --> 10:46.374
Uh, guys?

10:46.375 --> 10:47.583
- What?
- Oh, boy.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.958
[whinnies]

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
Hang on!

[Kate] No, no, no...

10:56.375 --> 10:58.083
[all scream]

10:58.916 --> 11:00.040
Ah... Huh?

11:00.041 --> 11:02.749
[Kate] What? Wait. Huh?

11:02.750 --> 11:04.291
What in the hell?

11:07.916 --> 11:11.165
Whoa! Did you see?
We just flew over a canyon!

11:11.166 --> 11:13.833
When we find your dad,
do not tell him about this.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.333
[Shang-Chi, Kate grunt]

11:17.708 --> 11:18.708
Oh, man.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.791
- Look.
- [Shang-Chi] Yeah.

11:21.458 --> 11:24.833
Looks like the railroad workers weren't
the only thing the Hood made off with.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.750
This looks like one of Stark's inventions.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.000
[Kate] Damn. I'll be.

11:33.541 --> 11:36.665
Stark Munitions, Hammer Steel,
Cross Manufacturing.

11:36.666 --> 11:38.208
The Hood's jacked all of 'em.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.207
This is an arsenal.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.541
Enough to take
the whole damn West by storm.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.166
Dad? Dad!

11:50.000 --> 11:51.499
Dad, where are you?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.999
Dad, are you here?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.874
Are they the workers?

11:54.875 --> 11:56.874
Yeah. Well, if the Hood's lookin'
for an army,

11:56.875 --> 11:59.582
a bunch of railroad workers
wouldn't be a bad start.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.708
[in Mandarin]

12:02.208 --> 12:03.208
[gasps]

12:10.375 --> 12:11.999
[in English] Why won't he answer?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.833
Some kind of devilry.

12:14.541 --> 12:16.415
The Hood's work, no doubt.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.458
Which means we need to have a word

12:19.625 --> 12:20.916
with the man himself.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.874
- [both] Huh?
- [guns cock]

12:30.875 --> 12:35.333
Well, if it ain't Hawkeye
and the Ten Rings!

12:35.916 --> 12:37.125
Welcome aboard.

12:37.916 --> 12:38.915
Uh-uh-uh.

12:38.916 --> 12:41.332
Now, you're gonna wanna drop those guns.

12:41.333 --> 12:45.166
And you, Ten Rings,
why don't you lower those fists of fury?

12:45.750 --> 12:48.291
Wouldn't want a party foul
to ruin this little guest's good time.

12:49.208 --> 12:52.082
Who are you?
Where's the Hood? Where is my sister?

12:52.083 --> 12:54.915
[laughs] I'm so-- Look at me, boys.

12:54.916 --> 12:57.415
My apologies. My name is Sonny Burch.

12:57.416 --> 13:01.040
I'm a proud investor in the bright,
new future the Hood's building.

13:01.041 --> 13:05.290
"Bright future," huh? Doesn't look
so bright for your prisoners back there.

13:05.291 --> 13:06.374
Prisoners?

13:06.375 --> 13:08.999
[laughs] No. No, no. You got it all wrong.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.833
You see, this here
is a train of liberation.

13:12.541 --> 13:13.832
And those fine folks?

13:13.833 --> 13:15.415
Well, they've been conscripted into

13:15.416 --> 13:19.457
- a force that's gonna change the world.
- [growls]

13:19.458 --> 13:21.999
Conscription doesn't sound
like freedom to me.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.999
Free market in action.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.832
A little economic principle I like to call
"supply and demand."
