WEBVTT

00:12.958 --> 00:14.375
[chirping]

00:16.125 --> 00:18.666
[Jaskier] Vespula? Vespula!

00:19.791 --> 00:21.166
Are you even listening?

00:21.916 --> 00:24.666
What does Radovid even mean, I see people?

00:24.750 --> 00:28.083
How does he know what I see?
I mean, he's only met me, like, twice.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.958
[traders shouting outside]

00:30.583 --> 00:35.166
Nah… You can't play a player.
That's what I always say.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.666
He's hiding something,
and if I'm gonna help Geralt,

00:41.250 --> 00:43.375
I need to find out what that is.

00:44.833 --> 00:47.708
Because Geralt is…

00:49.125 --> 00:50.250
a hammer.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.750
-[cockerel crows]
-You know?

00:53.333 --> 00:54.958
[hooves clattering]

00:55.625 --> 00:56.625
You're confused.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.958
All right-- Wait-- Okay. Ah…

00:59.500 --> 01:02.625
When you're a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

01:02.708 --> 01:05.666
You see a nail
and you're like, "Grrr. Fuck this nail."

01:05.750 --> 01:08.500
"Fuck this nail, in particular."
And you hammer the nail.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.333
But sometimes
the problem is something else.

01:10.416 --> 01:14.000
Sometimes the problem is, uh…
a bunch of petunias,

01:14.083 --> 01:18.375
or a bowl of… porridge,
and you can't hammer a bowl of porridge.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.333
I mean, you can try,
but then your hammer gets all gunked up,

01:22.416 --> 01:25.958
porridge goes everywhere,
and then you have… no porridge.

01:26.041 --> 01:28.750
The solution requires

01:29.791 --> 01:31.458
a different kind of tool.

01:34.458 --> 01:37.416
And Radovid… is that tool.

01:38.125 --> 01:41.958
Radovid is… a spoon.

01:43.458 --> 01:46.000
-Oh, obviously.
-Obviously. Yeah.

01:46.958 --> 01:49.666
Aah… Yeah, I'm aware
this doesn't make a lot of sense.

01:49.750 --> 01:52.333
What I'm trying to say is,
the problem is different.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.333
The solution needs to be different.

01:57.583 --> 02:00.833
And Radovid… is different.

02:03.208 --> 02:07.708
He's intelligent.
He tries to hide it, but he's insightful.

02:08.708 --> 02:11.666
Sharp… like a knife.

02:13.625 --> 02:16.250
If he's a knife,
I need to keep him away from Geralt.

02:16.833 --> 02:18.458
[Vespula] You like him!

02:19.041 --> 02:21.125
Who, Geralt? Yeah, I guess.

02:21.208 --> 02:25.958
Platonically, and occasionally with
great effort, as one would a family goat.

02:26.041 --> 02:29.125
-Hang on, when did you get dressed?
-I mean the spoon guy.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.166
What, Radovid? No!

02:31.250 --> 02:32.250
-[Vespula] Yes.
-No!

02:32.791 --> 02:35.791
I've cursed you
for chasing tail of every kind.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.958
Men, women, dwarves,

02:38.041 --> 02:39.750
elves, polymorphous--

02:39.833 --> 02:43.041
That was one time and I… regret nothing.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.333
-It was amazing.
-Hmm.

02:44.416 --> 02:48.041
But never have I ever
seen you have a crush.

02:48.125 --> 02:49.708
[playful music]

02:49.791 --> 02:51.166
-A crush?
-Mmm.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.583
Oh, you think I have crushes.

02:53.666 --> 02:54.750
Mmm-hmm.

02:55.250 --> 02:58.208
-Crushes are for children, my darling.
-Mmm?

02:58.291 --> 02:59.458
[Vespula gasps]

02:59.541 --> 03:02.458
-[Jaskier] I have mind-bending…
-Mmm?

03:03.083 --> 03:04.958
…world-ending,

03:05.041 --> 03:07.166
heart-wrenching affairs.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.166
-Whatever you say.
-[laughs]

03:14.041 --> 03:16.208
-The Lothario of Lyria.
-Oh!

03:16.750 --> 03:19.166
-The Romancer of Redania!
-Aah!

03:19.250 --> 03:21.166
-The Stud of Cidaris!
-[laughs]

03:21.250 --> 03:22.875
-[banging on door]
-[Geralt] Jaskier.

03:23.541 --> 03:25.625
For fuck's…

03:26.375 --> 03:28.958
Sorry. It's the family goat.

03:30.583 --> 03:33.250
[Jaskier] Good to see you too.
How'd it go?

03:33.333 --> 03:34.916
[Geralt] Not quite as expected.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.875
[Jaskier] Did you find the castle?

03:37.958 --> 03:40.000
Please tell me you killed Firefingers.

03:40.083 --> 03:42.500
-[horse neighs]
-[Geralt] Rience wasn't there.

03:43.416 --> 03:45.416
I did find something else, though.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.166
Yeah, and what's that?

03:47.250 --> 03:48.083
[girl talking]

03:48.166 --> 03:49.500
-[Geralt] Her.
-[murmuring]

03:49.583 --> 03:51.000
[Jaskier] And she is?

03:51.583 --> 03:52.583
I don't know.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.666
[girl] Ooh, ooh… ooh!

03:54.750 --> 03:56.250
But she thinks she's Ciri.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.541
[girl] Always a source. No room for…

03:59.750 --> 04:01.166
I hate you. Ooh!

04:01.250 --> 04:03.250
[Geralt] It's all right… Ciri.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.541
-This is a friend.
-[muttering]

04:06.125 --> 04:07.416
I'm Jaskier.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.208
[girl] Always a source.
No room for vermin.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.333
-Always.
-Fuck. Is she all right?

04:13.416 --> 04:15.291
She was part of an experiment.

04:15.375 --> 04:17.083
-[girl] Don't be…
-The only survivor.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.375
[whimpering]

04:18.458 --> 04:21.916
She has lucid moments,
but reverts back to this.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.083
[singing]

04:23.166 --> 04:24.958
Whatever she's rambling about,

04:25.833 --> 04:28.041
it's stuck in her head
in a nonsensical loop.

04:28.666 --> 04:30.250
I need to find out why.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.500
[Jaskier] Please tell me you have a plan.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.583
[Geralt] We're taking her to Anika.

04:36.166 --> 04:38.875
If this is an enchantment,
she'll be able to fix it.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.125
And who's Anika?

04:42.125 --> 04:45.208
She's a druid.
And a friend of my mother's.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
[girl chuckling softly]

05:02.041 --> 05:04.041
[dramatic music]

05:09.125 --> 05:11.500
-[man] Yep, it's him all right.
-[Roach snorts]

05:11.583 --> 05:13.791
Smelled you from two hilltops away.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.416
What are you doing here, Otto?

05:16.500 --> 05:20.791
Blame the heightened senses,
but we both know you're a ripe old bugger.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.083
I suppose you're here for a reason.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.583
[girl murmuring]

05:26.666 --> 05:28.583
-[Geralt] Hello, Anika.
-[girl] Wait. Just--

05:28.666 --> 05:30.750
-[Otto] She's missed you too.
-[sighs]

05:34.250 --> 05:35.083
Come on.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.416
[rustling]

05:42.500 --> 05:45.750
-[clattering]
-[Jaskier] Whew! Oh, that burns.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.750
That burns like a Raróg's arsehole.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.791
-[chuckles] What is it?
-[Otto] Uh, that's table salt.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.708
[Jaskier coughing] Yeah.

05:52.791 --> 05:54.125
Ooh-hoo.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.791
Yep, that's just, uh…
that's just table salt.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.250
That's not, um… not very druidic.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.541
-I'm not a druid.
-Oh, right.

06:01.625 --> 06:02.541
I'm a werewolf.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.041
Whoa. What? You're-- What? Uh, a…

06:05.125 --> 06:08.708
[chuckles] I was bit,
back in the plague of '21.

06:08.791 --> 06:12.291
Went out to the woods to isolate.
Avoid the disease.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.958
Was so worried about boils
and shitting myself to death,

06:15.041 --> 06:16.666
I wasn't thinking about werewolves.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.041
Priority, yeah. I get it.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.750
Geralt was hired by the villagers
to kill me.

06:21.416 --> 06:22.833
He found me a cure instead.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.625
-Kept close to my chest, it keeps me safe.
-Oh.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.666
Almost got himself killed
in the process, but…

06:30.708 --> 06:32.250
he saved my life.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.875
Yeah. Seems about right.

06:35.958 --> 06:37.958
[girl murmuring softly]

06:40.666 --> 06:42.041
I don't know…

06:43.708 --> 06:45.125
How'd you and Otto meet?

06:45.791 --> 06:47.291
It was about a year ago.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.666
We were at the Temple of Truth. Mourning.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.333
His wife, Edwina, was killed in a fire.
The children too.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.166
I was there for Visenna.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.041
She's dead?

07:11.333 --> 07:13.333
She talked about you a lot at the end.

07:17.666 --> 07:19.666
[mournful music]

07:23.041 --> 07:25.541
Well, whoever did this
fucked her up pretty good.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.625
It's a mind-control enchantment.

07:28.333 --> 07:29.833
[Geralt] Mind control?

07:29.916 --> 07:32.125
So someone needs her
to believe she's Ciri.

07:33.291 --> 07:34.833
It's extremely powerful.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.125
Elements of Chaos, druidic magic,

07:38.208 --> 07:40.583
even some ancient elven sorcery
in the spell.

07:41.666 --> 07:43.833
Oh, that's another thing.
She's part elven.

07:43.916 --> 07:46.541
Maybe a couple
of generations removed, but still.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.333
Poor girl's head's a tangled mess.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.208
Who would have the power to do this?

07:52.291 --> 07:54.916
I don't know anyone
with the knowledge to do this.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.541
It would take lifetimes
to acquire all these tricks.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.958
Whoever this mage is,
they have quite a variety of interests.

08:04.458 --> 08:06.000
[Otto] An extraction elixir.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.250
[Anika] Well done, Otto.

08:10.916 --> 08:12.458
[uncorks bottle]

08:13.750 --> 08:15.208
[soft hissing]

08:15.291 --> 08:16.791
[mystical music]

08:17.625 --> 08:18.500
[winces]

08:19.750 --> 08:21.000
[gasps and splutters]

08:21.916 --> 08:23.500
[whimpering]

08:25.250 --> 08:27.666
Ah, it'll take a while,
and there's no guarantee.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.958
If it works, she'll be able
to tell us who did this.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.958
[Geralt] And what they want with Ciri.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.833
[dramatic music]

08:38.500 --> 08:40.208
[seabirds calling]

08:43.500 --> 08:45.916
-[bell tinkles]
-[Ciri] This is the dwarven bank.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.875
-I thought we were going to Aretuza.
-[Yennefer] We are.

08:49.958 --> 08:53.250
But as you said yourself,
there's always more to the picture.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.958
-Aah! [laughs]
-[dwarf] My eyes deceive me!

08:56.041 --> 08:59.541
For surely,
a creature this beautiful cannot be real!

09:01.125 --> 09:02.541
My sweet Yennefer,

09:02.625 --> 09:06.583
it is the most sumptuous of pleasures,
as always.

09:06.666 --> 09:09.875
-The pleasure is all mine, Giancardi.
-Mmm!

09:09.958 --> 09:13.250
Please, take a seat
while we finalize your arrangements.

09:14.125 --> 09:18.458
[Giancardi] Horror!
Pure 'orror on my family's faces,

09:18.541 --> 09:21.375
as they watched me
dragged away to certain death,

09:21.458 --> 09:23.833
their own fate hanging in the balance.

09:24.416 --> 09:27.541
When who should appear?
A goddess from the heaven?

09:28.166 --> 09:31.666
-Better! Yennefer of Vengerberg.
-[Yennefer giggles]

09:31.750 --> 09:35.125
She blasted the villainous wretches
into dust.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.000
You exaggerate my heroism.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.250
[Giancardi] Nonsense.

09:38.333 --> 09:41.416
This is why the Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name,

09:41.500 --> 09:43.583
will do anything for a friend.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.625
For your other matter,

09:47.708 --> 09:50.541
my most secure vault is yours.

09:50.625 --> 09:51.583
Thank you.

09:52.250 --> 09:55.416
If it's not too much to ask,
I have one more favor.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.041
-[Giancardi] Sure.
-My ward needs a chaperone.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.666
-Say no more.
-[Ciri] What?

09:59.750 --> 10:01.875
Fabio is at your disposal.

10:02.375 --> 10:05.166
I thought you said
this was important for my future.

10:05.666 --> 10:08.500
It is. But first, my past must be settled.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.250
I know you're nervous.
Let me be there with you.

10:12.791 --> 10:14.750
[whimsical music]

10:27.625 --> 10:28.625
There.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.625
Now you look ordinary.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.750
Stop that.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.333
No one is after you here.
You're just a normal girl having fun.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.750
Take this. Buy something nice.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.875
Now, let me see that talisman
you're constantly fiddling with.

10:51.666 --> 10:53.666
-[speaking in Elder]
-[shimmering sound]

10:54.250 --> 10:55.125
What's that for?

10:55.916 --> 10:57.083
A locator spell.

10:57.750 --> 11:01.416
If you get into any trouble,
hold this tight and recite the chant.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.833
But don't get into any trouble.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.500
[sighs]

11:09.791 --> 11:11.791
[man breathing heavily]

11:15.041 --> 11:16.166

-[Vizimir grunts]

11:16.250 --> 11:17.916
-[clang]
-[man yelps]

11:19.083 --> 11:20.875
-[Dijkstra] Your Highness…
-[Vizimir growls]

11:21.541 --> 11:23.166
Your Highness, uh…

11:23.916 --> 11:26.333
there seems to be
some confusion among your advisors.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.583
-[clang]
-[Vizimir] Yes!

11:28.666 --> 11:29.750
[man groans]

11:29.833 --> 11:32.458
-Did you see that?
-Yes, very good.

11:32.541 --> 11:36.500
Whispers of a meeting
with an emissary from Nilfgaard?

11:36.583 --> 11:37.625
Oh, that. Yes.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.041
-We brokered a deal.
-[laughs]

11:40.916 --> 11:44.041
Quite a good one. In the inevitable event
of their push North,

11:44.125 --> 11:46.500
Nilfgaard has agreed
to leave Redania untouched.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.791
And they're offering
half of Temeria as a vassal state.

11:49.875 --> 11:54.875
Oh, pray tell, my lord, what's the return
on this generous Nilfgaardian investment?

11:54.958 --> 11:56.916
Oh, nothing we can't afford.

11:57.000 --> 11:57.875
"We"?

11:57.958 --> 11:59.166
-[clang]
-[man groans]

11:59.250 --> 12:02.958
And, should we find her first, we turn
the Princess of Cintra over to them.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.375
You are being conned!

12:07.666 --> 12:10.666
With all due respect, sir,
Nilfgaard are playing you for a fool.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.458
With all due respect, Dijkstra,

12:12.541 --> 12:15.083
you provide the intelligence,
I make the decisions.

12:15.166 --> 12:16.541
-[sighs]

12:16.625 --> 12:18.041

12:18.125 --> 12:20.208
-[thump]
-[Eva] Pardon, your Grace…

12:20.708 --> 12:21.791
[man groans]

12:22.375 --> 12:23.625
Queen Hedwig sent me to see

12:23.708 --> 12:27.333
if you're finished with the, uh…
important affairs of state?

12:27.416 --> 12:31.791
She said to tell you they're here.
In case you wanted to say, uh… hello.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.375
Oh, yes. Quite finished.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.500
But you've still got two more serves.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.958
It can wait. My sweet Hedwig can't.

12:39.041 --> 12:42.458
Sire, as your most senior advisor,
I cannot stress enough that--

12:42.541 --> 12:44.291
[Vizimir] You stress too much.

12:45.875 --> 12:49.333
The only reason you have any power here,
Sigismund, is because of me.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.166
Don't forget that.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.375
[chuckles]

12:56.375 --> 12:57.375
[door slams]

12:57.458 --> 13:00.291
He doesn't take a shit
without me knowing about it.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.208
No one gets a private audience with him
outside my purview.

13:03.291 --> 13:07.083
Radovid told us they did. He was right.
And they're doing it again.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.541
Vizimir's not scheming alone.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.500
Queen Hedwig has been
in such a useful mood of late.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.250
Perhaps it's time
to make her useful to us.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.541
Or should I do it?

13:18.041 --> 13:20.250
No. You have enough fires to fight.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.500
Hmm.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.208
Speaking of fires, annoyingly,
I met another dead end

13:24.291 --> 13:27.416
through that portal in the shape
of an artsy-fartsy crafting studio.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.833
Apparently, Rience is being backed
by someone with appalling taste.

13:30.916 --> 13:35.583
I meant the portal itself.
You said it felt different. More powerful.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.541
Perhaps it's time
to reach out to one of your old community.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.750
-Tissaia might be useful.
-Ooh…

13:42.833 --> 13:46.291
I only mean
that if what the bard says is true,

13:46.875 --> 13:48.708
the witcher is on our scent.

13:48.791 --> 13:51.708
If he gets to Rience first,
we lose the girl.

13:51.791 --> 13:53.250
And our leverage.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.375
Which is why we must both act now.

13:55.875 --> 13:59.416
You know as well as I do, there are
many ways to persuade the stubborn.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.041
Use Radovid.
Time for him to cut his teeth.

14:05.208 --> 14:06.458
[Radovid] Yes, Dijkstra.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.166
Use me.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.791
Shall I, uh… chat with kitchen hands?

14:11.875 --> 14:14.833
Uh, watch for shady carriages rolling up?

14:16.250 --> 14:17.875
Shadow my brother's wife?

14:19.041 --> 14:22.333
You seem nowhere close
to finding this powerful Princess Cirilla.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.458
You're just so busy
with your royal duties,

14:25.541 --> 14:27.208
I dare not split your focus.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.750
I don't need your help.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.750
Well, tell that to your king.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.541
And your boss.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.250
[door grinding]

14:47.041 --> 14:47.875
[Yennefer] You came.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.833
-[coins shuffling]
-[door clangs shut]

14:49.916 --> 14:51.208
Strange, isn't it?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.500
Men bleed and kill for this stuff.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.416
Only to let it rust.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.166
In dark rooms.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.750
[Yennefer] Because it's worthless.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.291
It's too soft to make anything useful.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.375
You can't eat it. Can't fuck it.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.208
Though the King of Aedirn
used to like to try.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.875
Its power comes
from believing in its value.

15:13.958 --> 15:17.250
An illusion designed
to control the masses.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.500
The leader of the Brotherhood
should know all about that.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.291
She seems to know everything else.

15:24.583 --> 15:27.458
You know, it started
to gnaw at me, back in Ellander.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.625
Northerners killing their own.

15:30.708 --> 15:31.875
[melancholy music]

15:31.958 --> 15:35.458
The whispers of a dozen bounties
on Cirilla of Cintra.

15:35.541 --> 15:38.541
When last everyone knew,
she was killed in the slaughter.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.875
I think you learned Cirilla was alive
and shared the news,

15:43.958 --> 15:46.250
hoping to curry favor
with the Northern kings.

15:48.208 --> 15:51.583
Except no one can find her.
The Brotherhood is on their shit list,

15:51.666 --> 15:54.500
and they're so focused
on terrorizing an orphan

15:54.583 --> 15:57.583
that they can't see an empire
waiting to destroy them.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.333
Curry favor?

16:03.083 --> 16:04.916
I don't know what's more insulting.

16:05.625 --> 16:08.083
That you think my goals so basic,

16:08.666 --> 16:11.083
or that you free
a Nilfgaardian prisoner of war,

16:11.166 --> 16:12.916
then lecture me on Northern unity.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.625
What mess will you
leave us with this time?

16:19.208 --> 16:20.666
I have been a mess.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
And I'm sorry.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.875
When I tried to kill myself at Aretuza,
I was so desperate to control my destiny.

16:30.916 --> 16:33.000
You weren't taking control.
You were losing it.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.000
I know.

16:34.666 --> 16:36.583
And I still feel like that sometimes.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.041
Like I'm at a loss.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.291
Rience. A fire mage.

16:43.875 --> 16:47.291
He's after Cirilla too, but someone
far more powerful is backing him.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.458
We can't let him get to her.

16:51.791 --> 16:56.875
You want me to help hide a princess
whose existence means war?

16:56.958 --> 16:58.375
I want more than that.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.875
She's extraordinary.

17:01.958 --> 17:05.541
She's the rightful heir to Cintra
and a great deal more, so I'm told.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.041
If war is coming,
there is no hiding her from it.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.416
Well, then, maybe
she can lead us out of it.

17:11.416 --> 17:14.458
For all the Brotherhood's faults,
they respect magic.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.250
She deserves to know
what hers is capable of.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.500
She deserves control of her destiny.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.125
Please.

17:27.208 --> 17:30.166
Please help me make this right. For us.

17:31.916 --> 17:32.916
For her.

17:35.666 --> 17:37.333
After all this time…

17:39.916 --> 17:43.333
After all your searching,
you actually did it.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.541
Did what?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.333
Became a mother.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.750

17:52.250 --> 17:53.500

17:57.958 --> 18:00.875
-Giancardi Bank, mind well the name.
-Yes, that's four.

18:01.458 --> 18:04.000
-Smart rates for a smart gentleman.
-[man 1] No thanks, son.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.625
-Smart rates for a smart lady?
-[woman] Oh, piss off.

18:06.708 --> 18:10.250
Smart rates. Come by Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name, to open an account.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.375
[man 2] Yeah, go on, then.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.083
Smart rates for a smart lady.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.083
Maybe you'd have better luck
if you didn't want it so bad.

18:16.958 --> 18:18.583
Maybe I'd have better luck

18:18.666 --> 18:21.708
if I wasn't with a girl
who pounds donuts like a truffle pig.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.666
-Want one?
-I'm wheat intolerant.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.625
Come by Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name, sir.

18:35.083 --> 18:36.208
What's that place?

18:36.750 --> 18:37.875
Thanedd Island.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.375
Home to Aretuza.
That's the Tower of the Gull. Tor Lara.

18:43.458 --> 18:44.791
Looks scary, doesn't it?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.958
Legend has it, they take failing novices
to the caves below the tower

18:49.041 --> 18:50.458
and turn them into eels.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.375
Sounds more exciting than this market.

[goat bleats]

Spectacles here would haunt you to your
deathbed, you rude little duck's arse.

[rowdy cheering and laughter]

19:33.333 --> 19:35.750

19:36.250 --> 19:38.166
-Monoliths.
-Whatever.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.208
There is.
I've been researching for months.

19:40.291 --> 19:43.291
Codringher and Fenn confirmed
it was buried in a Xin'trean cavern.

Where is the book?

'Cause it went to Aretuza.

By order of the emperor himself.

You owe me 20 marks, Isturd.

you're from the Scoia'tael front.

What news do you bring, son?

20:46.375 --> 20:47.541
Gallatin, sir.

-Bad news. We're getting slaughtered.
-[coughs]

20:51.375 --> 20:53.916
Forgive me.
I'm a fighter, not a politician.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.541
I don't really know
how to sugarcoat the truth.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.541
All the better for it.

20:59.708 --> 21:00.833
Continue.

21:02.416 --> 21:04.250
[Gallatin] I've been a soldier
all my life.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.958
I take no pleasure in jumping rank.

21:06.041 --> 21:09.541
But Francesca has been siphoning off
our best fighters, our resources,

21:09.625 --> 21:12.958

straight to their graves.

21:13.041 --> 21:16.791
[Emhyr] Well, Francesca has made
many sacrifices for her people.

21:16.875 --> 21:19.208
What makes you think
her choices can't be trusted?

21:19.291 --> 21:21.625
Her choices are
in defiance of your orders, sir.

21:21.708 --> 21:25.541
She's not fighting to soften the North.
She's searching for a girl.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.083
[inhales sharply]

21:31.250 --> 21:32.750
I'd like you to stay awhile.

21:33.541 --> 21:35.500
We can resolve this issue,
I have no doubt.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.291
-Make sure this man is fed.
-[man] My lord.

21:38.375 --> 21:39.500
[boots stamp]

21:40.041 --> 21:40.916
Thank you.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.583
[marching away]

21:46.666 --> 21:48.666
[soldiers continue drilling outside]

21:50.625 --> 21:52.166
Thank you, my lord.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.750
I knew your righteousness would prevail.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.791
[Emhyr] Is this a manipulation
to end your punishment?

21:57.875 --> 22:01.250
Because, don't forget, it was deceit
that got you where you are now.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.583
No, my lord.

22:03.291 --> 22:05.000
I would not lie about this.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.125
I asked for a private audience
to protect your secret.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.708
But Cirilla… Cirilla is out there.

22:17.416 --> 22:19.125
I am having dreams about her.

22:19.625 --> 22:22.500
-She wants me to find her.
-You tried that once.

22:23.750 --> 22:24.875
You failed.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.083
My lord, I have been in the field.
Gallatin is a good fighter.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.291
He knows the land.
The elves are loyal to him.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.041
He can deliver us the North.

22:37.666 --> 22:40.916
Division among the elves
would only hurt our cause on both fronts.

22:43.625 --> 22:44.583
But, uh…

22:46.083 --> 22:48.875
an army is only as good as its leader, uh…

22:51.000 --> 22:53.250
I know a good leader when I see one.

22:59.333 --> 23:02.666
It gave me… no pleasure to punish you.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.916
But I had to know you could be trusted.

23:09.791 --> 23:12.250
That I had not lost you.

23:14.791 --> 23:16.541
Are you ready to come home, Cahir?

23:19.625 --> 23:20.500
Yes.

23:28.083 --> 23:28.916
Prove it.

23:38.291 --> 23:44.166
[Jaskier] I think you've chopped
enough wood here for… two,

23:45.375 --> 23:48.166
maybe three centuries of fire.

23:51.291 --> 23:52.708
What's the plan, Geralt?

23:55.541 --> 23:58.166
We wait for her to wake up,
make sure she's okay,

23:58.250 --> 24:00.666
find Rience and the mage that did this,
and kill them.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.000
And then what?

24:02.625 --> 24:06.541
Yarpen told me he saw you
talking to Philippa Eilhart in Ban Gleán.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.583
It's okay, Jaskier.

24:09.416 --> 24:10.958
What did Dijkstra want you to do?

24:13.208 --> 24:16.583
He wanted me to convince you

24:17.625 --> 24:19.125
to take Ciri to Redania.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.416
[chuckles]

24:20.500 --> 24:21.708
And I agree with him.

24:23.125 --> 24:27.500
She'd be safe with an army,
an entire army at her back.

24:27.583 --> 24:31.250
Ciri would be nothing more
than a brood mare on the Cintran throne.

24:31.333 --> 24:33.250
She's a princess, Geralt.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.083
That's what princesses do.

24:35.166 --> 24:38.458
They sit on little royal thrones
and they have little royal babies.

24:38.541 --> 24:41.625
And they rule kingdoms.
This is what Ciri wants.

24:41.708 --> 24:45.125
Does she want to be a political pawn
for Vizimir and Dijkstra?

24:45.208 --> 24:46.333
-No…
-No.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.333
We stay the course.

24:48.416 --> 24:49.875
Neutrality has consequences too.

24:49.958 --> 24:54.291
There are already consequences, Jaskier.
And not just for Ciri.

24:55.166 --> 24:58.375
I thought by taking her off the board,
the world would stop trying to use her.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.375
Instead, they're trying
to use others in her place.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.000
And they will continue to.

25:03.083 --> 25:07.333
Because that is what people in power do.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.500
But she's not a witcher.

25:10.291 --> 25:16.875
She's certainly not an Aretuzan witch
sourcing magic out of… stones, or hemp,

25:16.958 --> 25:20.166
or plants,
or whatever it is that Yennefer does.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.041
She's a princess.

25:23.166 --> 25:24.625
I think you should trust her.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.083
Her source.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.583
Her… what now?

25:33.291 --> 25:34.375
You're right.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.666
[Jaskier] I'm right…

25:40.375 --> 25:42.916
Well, that's deeply worrying. What?

25:48.041 --> 25:49.041
[Anika] Geralt--

25:49.125 --> 25:51.250
-I need you to wake up.
-[Anika] Geralt, no.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.833
-[Otto] It's too soon.
-Can you hear me?

25:52.916 --> 25:54.541
[Otto] You could hurt
the extraction spell.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.250
You said there was always a source.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.208
-[sighs]
-[Geralt] What did you mean?

26:00.708 --> 26:02.208
Always a source to what?

26:03.291 --> 26:04.458
Magic.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.083
[Geralt] Can you tell me your name?

26:08.291 --> 26:09.375
Teryn.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.041
[Geralt] Good.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.291
Something happened
that affected your mind.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.833
Do you remember what happened?

26:19.625 --> 26:20.583
[gasps]

26:20.666 --> 26:22.500
I was dragged from my room.

26:22.583 --> 26:23.583
Yes.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.791
By a man.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.541
A man with a scar?

26:27.625 --> 26:28.875
[Anika] Careful, Geralt.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.958
[Teryn, shakily] He was there. Sometimes.

26:34.791 --> 26:37.833
And the woman with the funny voice.

26:38.833 --> 26:40.791
They all helped the man.

26:41.958 --> 26:43.125
The man, he…

26:45.666 --> 26:47.208
He always scared me.

26:48.333 --> 26:49.375
You knew him.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.666
At school.

26:53.166 --> 26:54.541
At Aretuza.

26:55.958 --> 26:57.166
[gasps]

26:57.791 --> 26:59.791
Oh… [sobbing]

26:59.875 --> 27:01.375
We need to put her back under.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.458
-[Geralt] I need a name.
-[Otto] I'll grab elixir.

27:03.541 --> 27:04.833
-[wailing]
-It's all right.

27:04.916 --> 27:06.708
-Just say it.
-What was his name, Teryn?

27:06.791 --> 27:08.791
[screaming]

27:10.333 --> 27:11.500
[wails]

27:12.791 --> 27:14.041
[sobs]

27:16.875 --> 27:18.625
[deep voice] Stupid witcher.

27:18.708 --> 27:21.833
You're doomed and you don't even know it.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.041
[overlapping voices]
I am Cirilla's destiny.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.250
May all ye wail,

27:27.333 --> 27:31.041
for the Destroyer of Nations is upon us.

27:34.166 --> 27:35.250
[yelps]

27:35.833 --> 27:37.041
Anika!

27:37.708 --> 27:39.916
-[cracking sounds]
-[groaning]

27:41.875 --> 27:42.750
[crunching]

27:42.833 --> 27:44.500
[deep voice] Geralt!

27:44.583 --> 27:46.375
-[growling]
-Jaskier, the amulet!

27:47.583 --> 27:48.791
No, no, no, no. Teryn. Teryn!

27:48.875 --> 27:50.958
-Jaskier!
-[roaring]

27:51.958 --> 27:53.333
-[grunting]
-Geralt!

27:55.375 --> 27:56.791
[Otto] Ah! Aah…

27:58.083 --> 28:00.541
-[Teryn gasping]
-[Jaskier] Shh, shh.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.291
-[Otto sighing]
-[Teryn whimpering]

28:05.875 --> 28:07.958
[Jaskier] Shh, shh.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.416
[barker] Roll up! Roll up!

28:15.500 --> 28:17.250
Roll up!

28:17.333 --> 28:18.791
See with your own eyes

28:18.875 --> 28:22.250
the most frightful creature
the gods ever created!

28:22.333 --> 28:27.208
A live basilisk, the venomous terror
of the Zerrikanian desert!

28:27.291 --> 28:29.750
An insatiable man-eater!

28:29.833 --> 28:31.291
-Only 15 groats.
-Told you.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.666
[barker] That's 15 groats, yeah?
Hey, you, hop it.

28:33.750 --> 28:36.708
15 groats, everyone. Yeah, go on.
Pay the money to the boy.

28:36.791 --> 28:38.666
In you go. Enjoy. In you go.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.583
Enjoy the show.
[chuckles] Enjoy the show.

28:42.708 --> 28:44.458
[barker continues shouting]

28:46.750 --> 28:47.708
[man] Come on, hurry up!

28:47.791 --> 28:51.708
Careful. These beasts
are notoriously unpredictable.

28:51.791 --> 28:53.583
I've fought enough of them to know.

28:55.541 --> 28:57.625
[woman] Hey, let's get to the front.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.416
[growling]

28:59.500 --> 29:02.125
-[Ciri] That cage looks small.
-Maybe it's a baby basilisk.

29:02.666 --> 29:05.708
That would be a rip-off.
How scary could that be?

29:06.791 --> 29:08.083
You'd be surprised.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.458
They are unpredictable.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.333
And unpredictable means trouble.

29:13.416 --> 29:15.250
What's wrong with a little trouble?

29:15.333 --> 29:17.625
[scoffs] A lot if you've lived my life.

29:19.375 --> 29:20.916
That sounds like a challenge.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.541
[soft clink]

29:23.625 --> 29:25.250
[growling continues]

29:26.583 --> 29:30.958
Ladies and gentlemen!

29:31.041 --> 29:32.791
[laughing]

29:32.875 --> 29:35.333
The king of all serpents.

29:35.416 --> 29:37.833
'Tis a most rare monster.

29:37.916 --> 29:39.083
-[thump]
-[squealing]

29:39.166 --> 29:44.000
Hatching from an egg
only laid by a knavish cockerel, well!

29:44.083 --> 29:46.666
Who presents his rump to another…

29:46.750 --> 29:50.041
in the manner of a horny hen!

29:50.125 --> 29:51.750
-Ooooh!
-[laughter]

29:51.833 --> 29:54.291
Cock-a-doodle-doo-ooh-ooh!

29:55.916 --> 29:57.041
Ta-da!

29:57.125 --> 29:58.041
[crowd gasps]

29:58.125 --> 30:00.166
An egg that must be brooded

30:00.833 --> 30:03.833
by a hundred and one venomous snakes.

30:03.916 --> 30:05.166
[growling]

30:05.250 --> 30:08.375
Good people, keep your distance.

30:08.958 --> 30:11.416
Its breath alone could poison you.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.083
-[Ciri] That's not a basilisk.
-[gasps and murmurs]

30:14.166 --> 30:15.708
[man] Stop interrupting, love.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.458
When the basilisk hatches,

30:19.541 --> 30:22.333
it devours the snakes,
imbibing their venom.

30:22.416 --> 30:25.125
And when a knight stabs it with his sword,

30:25.208 --> 30:27.625
the poison runs up the blade,
killing the knight…

30:27.708 --> 30:29.708
-Chhkk, chhkk! Outright.
-[crowd gasps]

30:29.791 --> 30:31.250
That is the falsest lie.

30:31.333 --> 30:32.833
'Tis the truest truth.

30:33.416 --> 30:37.250
That's why a basilisk can only be killed
by seeing its reflection in the mirror.

30:37.333 --> 30:38.791
Quite right, sir!

30:38.875 --> 30:41.416
-Don't.
-No, you're all wrong. This is a wyvern.

30:41.500 --> 30:45.208
And it's young, and it's starving
because you're keeping it in this cage!

30:45.916 --> 30:47.041
[laughs mockingly]

30:47.125 --> 30:49.583
Listen, darlin',
if you don't like my little show,

30:49.666 --> 30:52.166
why don't you just piss off and shut up?

30:53.875 --> 30:56.208
-[wyvern squeals]
-[barker groans]

30:57.458 --> 30:58.666
[wood crunching]

30:58.750 --> 31:00.333
[purring and chirping]

31:02.666 --> 31:04.166
[screaming]

31:04.250 --> 31:05.791
[chittering]

31:07.875 --> 31:09.541
-[roars]
-[screaming]

31:12.291 --> 31:13.625
[snarling]

31:13.708 --> 31:15.458
[screaming]

31:21.791 --> 31:23.583
[wyvern squealing]

31:31.250 --> 31:33.208
Oi, oi, you little shit!

31:36.000 --> 31:38.708
This girl is under the protection
of Giancardi Bank.

31:38.791 --> 31:40.500
Mind well the name, arsehole.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.541
[thumping]

31:43.625 --> 31:44.500
[gasps]

31:45.583 --> 31:47.541
[snarling]

31:48.291 --> 31:49.416
Where's my knife?

31:57.666 --> 31:58.625
Here!

32:00.333 --> 32:01.708
[wyvern cries]

32:01.791 --> 32:03.791
[wyvern whimpering]

32:04.583 --> 32:06.166
[woman] Who is she? Is she okay?

32:06.250 --> 32:09.625
-[Ciri groans]
-[knight] Get off of her, devil dog!

32:12.416 --> 32:14.250
You saved me, brave knight!

32:14.333 --> 32:16.375
We have a hero in our midst!

32:16.458 --> 32:18.250
-He saved us all!
-[knight] I did?

32:20.041 --> 32:22.208
-I did!
-[Ciri] I have to get out of here!

32:22.291 --> 32:25.166
[Fabio] That was fucking incredible!
Did you see me hit that guy?

32:25.250 --> 32:27.875
-[Ciri] Yennefer will kill me.
-I'll get fired, I don't even care!

32:27.958 --> 32:29.791
-Where the fuck's my money?
-I can travel.

32:29.875 --> 32:32.333
-Kick arse through this fucking Continent!
-Where's my money?

32:32.416 --> 32:33.875
-[woman] Hey, trouble!
-[coins jingle]

32:33.958 --> 32:34.958
[horse snorts]

32:37.791 --> 32:39.208
You were great in there.

32:41.666 --> 32:43.333
Fucking hell.

32:44.791 --> 32:46.375
I've gotta go. Thank you.

32:47.125 --> 32:49.708
-Where are you goin'?
-And good luck kicking arse!

32:53.708 --> 32:55.250
[speaking in Elder]

32:57.458 --> 32:58.875
[repeats spell]

32:59.500 --> 33:00.708
[repeats spell]

33:04.000 --> 33:05.208
Where are you, Yennefer?

33:08.625 --> 33:09.750
[repeats spell]

33:10.833 --> 33:11.916
[repeats spell]

33:12.000 --> 33:14.333
Another runaway.
You've had your fun, novice.

33:14.416 --> 33:16.375
-Back to the dorms.
-Get your hands off me!

33:16.458 --> 33:17.958
[gasps]

33:18.041 --> 33:20.333
You will address me
as Mistress Laux-Antille.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.833
And you'll clean the toilets
for your impertinence.

33:22.916 --> 33:24.250
[Yennefer] I'll take it from here.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.833
[Mistress Laux-Antille] Yen.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.750
[Sabrina] What are you doing here?

33:29.166 --> 33:31.291
Bringing my ward
to get a proper education,

33:31.375 --> 33:33.333
one she obviously sorely needs.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.083
Forgive her, Rita.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.500
So this is the girl.

33:45.625 --> 33:46.708
Don't look at her.

33:49.333 --> 33:50.291
Look at me.

33:53.833 --> 33:56.208
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

33:57.541 --> 33:59.541
[low rumbling]

34:04.166 --> 34:06.500
-[Yennefer] That's enough introductions.
-[breathing shakily]

34:07.166 --> 34:11.583
As an apology for her impudence, allow me
to treat you ladies to some luxury.

34:12.166 --> 34:13.541
[Sabrina] Thank gods, I'm bored.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.833
Shall we take the waters
at the Silver Heron?

34:15.916 --> 34:16.833
[both giggle]

34:16.916 --> 34:19.041
[Rita] Don't threaten me with a good time.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.166
[gasps]

34:22.916 --> 34:23.875
[sighs]

34:24.541 --> 34:26.541
[echoing laughter]

34:28.333 --> 34:31.416
[Rita chuckles] Hands off. He's mine.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.416
[Sabrina] I wasn't planning
on using my hands.

34:41.666 --> 34:44.000
[Rita] Fuck magic, let's stay here.

34:48.375 --> 34:52.208
[Sabrina] If this place ever closes,
I'll burn this fucking city to the ground.

34:53.291 --> 34:54.125
Here, girl!

34:56.875 --> 34:58.708
Novices these days are useless.

34:58.791 --> 35:01.250
-[Sabrina] Mmm.
-[Rita] Not like when we were girls.

35:02.958 --> 35:04.500
I told you to bring the wine.

35:04.583 --> 35:07.083
I'm surprised you can taste anything
at this point.

35:07.166 --> 35:09.166
Are you calling me a lush?

35:09.250 --> 35:11.541
Better a lush than a traitor.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.166
Tell me, Yennefer.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.416
Are the rumors about witchers true?

35:18.000 --> 35:21.166
That their mutations make them impotent?

35:21.250 --> 35:24.625
-[Rita] You're fucking a witcher? [laughs]
-[Sabrina] Atrocious, isn't it?

35:25.416 --> 35:28.041
-Almost as atrocious as your manners.
-Mmm.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.625
-[Rita] Ooh.
-[Sabrina giggles]

35:29.708 --> 35:33.791
Perhaps instead of dwelling on the past,
focus our attention on the future.

35:34.791 --> 35:36.333
I wanted red!

35:36.416 --> 35:37.541
[Sabrina] Here.

35:38.291 --> 35:39.416
We deserve a drink.

35:39.916 --> 35:42.875
After all the fires
we've been putting out between kingdoms.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.916
Fires we didn't start.

35:48.416 --> 35:50.416
[Rita] Damned Cintran princess.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.125
-What's so special about her, anyway?
-[Sabrina] Mmm.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.375
Girl, the wine! Now.

35:58.416 --> 35:59.416
Get it yourself.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.541
[bangs pitcher down]

36:04.291 --> 36:05.875
[laughs]

36:05.958 --> 36:07.333
She'll only screw it up.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.041
Besides, I know where the good stuff is.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.583
[gasps]

36:16.166 --> 36:18.750
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Shut the fuck up.

36:18.833 --> 36:22.458
-Before you spoil everything.
-I can't spoil something already rotten!

36:22.541 --> 36:24.958
This place, these women, it's horrible!

36:25.041 --> 36:27.625
"This place"? You're not a princess here.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.750
You're a low-level novice.
Get used to being treated like one.

36:30.833 --> 36:32.875
Entitlement will get you nowhere.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.375
[breathing heavily]
I don't want to do this.

36:35.958 --> 36:37.583
You know, I don't want to do this either.

36:38.208 --> 36:40.666
Tomorrow I'll be expected
to crawl back to the Brotherhood,

36:40.750 --> 36:43.125
tail between my legs,
begging for forgiveness.

36:43.208 --> 36:44.500
And I'll do it.

36:44.583 --> 36:48.625
Because Aretuza is my best hope
of protecting you from those who hunt you.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.958
Our best chance to be safe.

36:51.916 --> 36:54.541
-You have to go along to get along.
-To what end?

36:55.208 --> 36:59.208
If I can't learn to control my powers,
will you let Tissaia turn me into an eel?

36:59.291 --> 37:02.291
And if I do become
some powerful, learned Aretuzan maid,

37:02.375 --> 37:04.125
will you let her scrape out my insides

37:04.208 --> 37:07.083
to become vapid and power-hungry
like your friends out there?

37:07.166 --> 37:10.500
Tissaia is one of the most
powerful sorceresses on this Continent!

37:10.583 --> 37:13.041
You should be grateful
she's willing to teach you!

37:13.125 --> 37:14.416
[breathing heavily]

37:17.166 --> 37:19.041
[whispers] Just because she saved you

37:20.500 --> 37:22.875
does not mean
you owe her the rest of your life.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.750
You told me
to never apologize for my power,

37:26.833 --> 37:29.166
and yet that's all you seem to do.

37:30.041 --> 37:33.666
You want to be a great leader?
You want to change the world?

37:34.208 --> 37:35.791
Well, the day-to-day of leading

37:35.875 --> 37:38.583
is dealing with a lot of vapid,
power-hungry arseholes!

37:43.125 --> 37:44.291
I'm not Geralt.

37:45.416 --> 37:46.791
This isn't Kaer Morhen.

37:47.916 --> 37:50.333
This is the version of myself
I have to be here.

37:50.916 --> 37:54.166
So you need to find a version of yourself
that can deal with that.

37:54.666 --> 37:56.500
Trust me, I know you're not Geralt.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.791
-He would never sell his soul like this.
-[sobbing]

38:04.041 --> 38:05.375
-[yells]
-[glass clatters]

38:06.791 --> 38:07.958
[sobbing]

38:13.666 --> 38:15.208
[fire crackling]

38:15.291 --> 38:16.583
-[owl hooting]
-[sighs]

38:18.916 --> 38:20.625
[gasping]

38:21.791 --> 38:23.208
-It's all right.
-[sighs]

38:25.791 --> 38:27.166
Thanks to Otto.

38:28.791 --> 38:31.125
I've never seen
someone make a potion so fast.

38:32.208 --> 38:33.333
You taught him well.

38:34.791 --> 38:36.750
[sighs] Just like Visenna taught me.

38:43.041 --> 38:44.375
Did she suffer?

38:47.125 --> 38:49.791
She was mistaken for an elf
while helping a villager.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.458
[mournful music]

38:52.583 --> 38:54.208
She was beaten very badly.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.250
Does that make you feel better or worse?

39:01.583 --> 39:03.083
I never wanted her to hurt.

39:06.041 --> 39:09.000
-Just wanted her to know what she did.
-Oh, she knew.

39:09.666 --> 39:13.583
Love for a child forces parents to make
the hardest choices of their lives.

39:14.708 --> 39:16.083
Impossible ones, even.

39:18.083 --> 39:21.166
Chances are, they toil over it
for the rest of their lives.

39:30.708 --> 39:32.625
I do remember bits of our life.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.041
She smelled like embers.

39:40.375 --> 39:44.458
From keeping those measly fires alive
for the long nights.

39:47.916 --> 39:49.375
I remember my hunger.

39:50.666 --> 39:53.125
And her stomach growling
twice as loud as mine.

39:55.791 --> 39:57.083
She used her magic

39:58.500 --> 40:01.291
to create elaborate meals
that we couldn't afford.

40:07.958 --> 40:10.208
I would have done anything
to make her smile.

40:13.250 --> 40:14.375
And yet…

40:16.916 --> 40:18.208
the day she left me,

40:19.041 --> 40:20.291
she was sick.

40:23.875 --> 40:26.125
She needed water,
so I went to get her some.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.000
And when I came back…

40:30.541 --> 40:31.666
she was gone.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.375
I called for her.

40:39.458 --> 40:40.458
But she was gone.

40:42.041 --> 40:43.833
She loved you the best she could.

40:45.958 --> 40:48.208
To save you, she had to let you go.

40:50.458 --> 40:53.541
-This can't have been the only choice.
-It wasn't.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.625
It's simply the one she made.

40:57.875 --> 41:00.416
And now you have
your own impossible decision.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.250
I won't abandon Ciri.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.458
Even if it costs me my life.

41:06.916 --> 41:08.333
[sighs]

41:11.041 --> 41:12.000
Teryn.

41:14.458 --> 41:17.541
Can she stay here,
while I work out how to help her?

41:17.625 --> 41:20.208
-Mmm, of course.
-Thank you.

41:21.333 --> 41:22.458
Where are you going?

41:25.041 --> 41:26.958
Aretuza. [sighs]

41:30.416 --> 41:32.416
[water splashing gently]

41:35.708 --> 41:36.916
[quiet laughter]

41:38.458 --> 41:39.666
Are you all right?

41:40.958 --> 41:42.166
No.

41:45.291 --> 41:46.750
The magic is one thing.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.833
-But the politics…
-Hmm.

41:50.958 --> 41:53.875
Even if I can curry enough favor to get
back into the Brotherhood's fold

41:53.958 --> 41:55.666
and get her trained, you're right.

41:55.750 --> 41:58.041
War is coming,
and she's at the center of it.

41:59.458 --> 42:02.083
Mages have kept kings in check
for centuries.

42:04.208 --> 42:07.541
-We'll find a way.
-Toxicity's infectious.

42:09.333 --> 42:13.750
The kings have turned against each other.
How long before mages follow suit?

42:14.500 --> 42:17.916
If we are to unite the North,
we must be united.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.166
[Tissaia chuckles]

42:21.666 --> 42:22.875
A conclave.

42:24.041 --> 42:24.875
What?

42:26.416 --> 42:28.333
We host a conclave of mages.

42:29.958 --> 42:33.291
-We haven't had one since before Sodden.
-And then we went to war.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.166
So we do it differently this time.

42:35.250 --> 42:40.000
Instead of discord and debate,
we focus on trust.

42:40.958 --> 42:41.833
Togetherness.

42:47.375 --> 42:49.166
Is this also the girl's doing?

42:49.791 --> 42:52.875
If we have any hope
of appealing to the kings,

42:53.958 --> 42:56.541
we first have to find
better versions of ourselves.

42:59.708 --> 43:00.916
I'm willing to try.

43:02.583 --> 43:03.583
Are you?

43:05.541 --> 43:07.208
-[chuckles]
-[laughter downstairs]

43:10.833 --> 43:12.625
[wistful music]

43:12.708 --> 43:14.083
[dog barking]

43:21.625 --> 43:23.208
[breathing shakily]

43:23.291 --> 43:24.250
[whispers] Geralt.

43:24.958 --> 43:26.375
Hey, Geralt, where are you?

43:26.458 --> 43:28.958
-[whispering voices]
-Geralt, where are you?

43:29.041 --> 43:30.625
-[wind whistling]
-[voice] Who's Geralt?

43:30.708 --> 43:32.291
-[voices overlapping]
-Where are you?

43:32.375 --> 43:34.416
[jumbled voices and laughter]

43:34.500 --> 43:36.625
[voice whispers] He's coming. Now.

43:36.708 --> 43:38.416
[Geralt] We'll meet again soon.

43:40.833 --> 43:43.750
[mouth full] I understand your concerns.
But I've made up my mind.

43:43.833 --> 43:46.208
This Cirilla nonsense is
too much of a headache.

43:47.083 --> 43:48.916
I couldn't agree more, Your Majesty.

43:49.791 --> 43:52.375
But bargaining with Nilfgaard
is not the answer.

43:53.166 --> 43:56.625
-The queen is opinionated and strong.
-Like a bull.

43:56.708 --> 44:00.375
And Radovid is eager to please.
But all three of you are far too important

44:00.458 --> 44:03.708
to burden yourself with the minutiae
of Redanian intelligence.

44:04.541 --> 44:05.708
What would you suggest?

44:06.583 --> 44:10.583
Hope I'm not interrupting.
Uh, this was left with my manservant.

44:11.791 --> 44:13.750
-The note says it's for you.
-Oh.

44:14.541 --> 44:16.333
A present. [chuckles]

44:20.583 --> 44:23.000
"Courtesy of Nilfgaard."
See, I told you, Dijkstra.

44:23.083 --> 44:24.375
They're not so ba--

44:25.875 --> 44:27.333
[yelps]

44:27.416 --> 44:29.333
[gasps]

44:29.416 --> 44:31.166
-[wailing]
-[coughing]

44:31.875 --> 44:33.250
[Vizimir sobbing]

44:34.500 --> 44:37.250
I want men on every door and window.
Nobody in or out but me!

44:37.333 --> 44:39.541
Tell the gatekeeper
to scout the perimeter.

44:39.625 --> 44:41.833
Bring me
Radovid's manservant immediately!

44:41.916 --> 44:44.000
-[sobbing]
-[guard 1] With me! Now!

44:44.583 --> 44:46.500
Man on every door! We've got intruders!

44:46.583 --> 44:50.666
[whispers] I swear to you,
I will not let them get away with this.

44:51.166 --> 44:52.875
-[men running]
-[guard 1] Guard the gates!

44:52.958 --> 44:54.708
-Come. Come.
-[guard 2] Secure the perimeter!

44:55.875 --> 44:57.791
-Through that gate!
-[guard 3] By me!

44:59.250 --> 45:00.750
-Through there, now!
-Come.

45:01.333 --> 45:03.333
-Take the king to his chambers.
-My lord.

45:04.458 --> 45:06.625
-[distant door slams]
-[guards yelling]

45:07.208 --> 45:08.833
-[sighs]
-[Vizimir sobbing]

45:12.750 --> 45:14.083
[nearby door slams]

45:15.625 --> 45:17.083
[intriguing music]

45:17.166 --> 45:18.208
Hmm.

45:22.333 --> 45:23.916
[Radovid gasps]

45:24.000 --> 45:25.166
Mmm. Hah!

45:27.625 --> 45:28.541
You.

45:30.500 --> 45:33.791
All that talk of…
making the queen more useful.

45:35.250 --> 45:36.333
You and Philippa did this.

45:38.791 --> 45:40.166
You won't get away with it.

45:40.666 --> 45:41.541
Huh.

45:41.625 --> 45:42.916
It's treason.

45:44.875 --> 45:47.208
-I'll tell my brother.
-Tell him what, exactly?

45:48.791 --> 45:52.083
That his strong, opinionated queen,
gods rest her soul,

45:52.166 --> 45:54.333
went a little rogue
in the secret meetings,

45:55.000 --> 45:56.666
and deserved to be assassinated?

45:58.166 --> 45:59.333
On your watch?

46:00.333 --> 46:01.833
-He trusted you.
-Trusts.

46:05.125 --> 46:06.208
He trusts me.

46:07.750 --> 46:08.875
Now more than ever.

46:10.333 --> 46:12.333
I am his most important advisor.

46:12.833 --> 46:17.625
Whereas you are
a weak, silly, ineffectual little shit

46:17.708 --> 46:20.416
who just delivered his wife's head
to him in a box.

46:21.750 --> 46:23.583
Well, now I come to think of it,

46:23.666 --> 46:26.333
how do we know
you weren't involved in her treachery?

46:29.500 --> 46:32.625
You want to help?
Go back to sucking on the royal teat

46:32.708 --> 46:36.041
until you're just drunk enough
to forget this terrible tragedy.

46:36.875 --> 46:38.791
And keep your mouth shut.

46:40.833 --> 46:43.833
[whispers] Because next time,
it could be your head in a box.

46:47.541 --> 46:49.541
[dramatic music]

47:02.666 --> 47:04.666
[echoing sighs]

47:07.375 --> 47:09.375
[romantic music]

47:17.541 --> 47:19.541
[groaning]

47:23.458 --> 47:24.541
Breathe.

47:26.541 --> 47:27.500
Breathe.

47:36.416 --> 47:38.416
-[screams]
-[echoing gasps]

47:45.458 --> 47:46.500
Mmm.

47:50.708 --> 47:51.791
Enough.

47:51.875 --> 47:52.833
[laughs]

47:53.916 --> 47:55.250
[groans]

47:57.250 --> 47:59.333
Aah! [laughing]

48:00.666 --> 48:02.666
Oh, I wish you were there today.

48:03.916 --> 48:05.916
I mean, I knew Hedwig had a thick neck,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.708
but gods, that was a workout
to cut through. [chuckles]

48:10.166 --> 48:11.250
[Philippa] Mmm.

48:13.250 --> 48:16.708
I wonder what Dijkstra thought
of my pièce de résistance.

48:16.791 --> 48:18.000
[Philippa] Mmm.

48:18.083 --> 48:20.375
No one ever expects
a head in a box, do they?

48:22.041 --> 48:24.083
-[Philippa] It doesn't make any sense.
-Hmm?

48:24.166 --> 48:27.416
Emhyr uses mages
for cannon fodder, not emissaries.

48:29.208 --> 48:31.916
The woman you saw in the meeting
didn't move her mouth.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.541
Oh, well, it takes all sorts,
I suppose. [chuckles]

48:35.875 --> 48:37.833
Unless she was using telepathy.

48:39.666 --> 48:40.625
Hmm.

48:41.708 --> 48:43.708
But how did she manage
to portal into the palace

48:43.791 --> 48:46.333
and through my protection enchantments?

48:47.250 --> 48:49.708
Maybe because the portal was special?

48:52.250 --> 48:53.916
A portal is a portal.

48:55.625 --> 48:56.875
I've seen your portals.

48:58.666 --> 49:01.166
[sighs] This wasn't that.

49:01.250 --> 49:06.333
This was a swirling black vortex
of fucking unnervingness.

49:09.541 --> 49:11.750
The mage backing Rience…

49:13.708 --> 49:15.208
works for Nilfgaard.

49:17.291 --> 49:18.666
Fuck me.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.125
[caws]

49:22.208 --> 49:25.291
[Rience] The only reason
I fucking agreed to do this job

49:25.375 --> 49:28.500
is because you told me
you didn't work for Nilfgaard.

49:28.583 --> 49:30.666
[Lydia] I don't. I work for my lord.

49:30.750 --> 49:33.000
-Who works for fucking Nilfgaard!
-[cawing]

49:33.083 --> 49:36.958
Oh, Rience, don't get so agitated.
It makes you uglier.

49:37.750 --> 49:42.541
As for my lord, working with Nilfgaard
is not the same as working for Nilfgaard.

49:42.625 --> 49:45.500
The White Flame is just a means to an end.

49:45.583 --> 49:47.791
A small piece of a much bigger puzzle.

49:48.666 --> 49:51.208
-Don't worry your hideous little face.
-[crow caws]

49:52.125 --> 49:53.958
At least I still have a face.

49:55.791 --> 49:58.083
Instead of just the illusion of one.

50:00.125 --> 50:03.916
Tell him I'm growing tired
of being kept in the dark.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.708
If he wants me
to go along with his little plan,

50:08.541 --> 50:10.166
I have a demand of my own.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
[Francesca speaking in Elder]

50:20.708 --> 50:24.583
-[continues speaking in Elder]
-[creaking and sighing sounds]

50:30.250 --> 50:31.583
[Filavandrel] Hey.

50:33.125 --> 50:36.166
You… are exhausted.

50:36.958 --> 50:39.416
-You need to eat.
-Not until they do.

50:41.666 --> 50:42.875
What news from the scouts?

50:42.958 --> 50:46.791
There was a rumor that she was spotted
in Maribor. Nothing came of it.

50:48.708 --> 50:49.833
And Gallatin?

50:49.916 --> 50:53.333
He's headed to Xin'trea
with the roundy general.

50:54.291 --> 50:56.875
So perhaps it would be wise to consider

50:57.500 --> 50:59.000
an escape plan.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.041
The only escape I'll take
is death, Filavandrel.

51:05.166 --> 51:06.458
[knocking at door]

51:08.708 --> 51:13.458
I don't miss the snobbery of the city,
but shit, I do miss the services.

51:13.541 --> 51:16.166
[sighs] Your White Flame
sure knows how to host.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.875
-[door slams]
-Well…

51:18.500 --> 51:19.791
I suppose it's not hard

51:19.875 --> 51:22.333
to impress a backwards pointy
like you, though, is it?

51:22.416 --> 51:25.000
I'd rather be a backwards pointy
invited to the palace

51:25.083 --> 51:27.791
than the rich little shit
who got kicked out of it.

51:27.875 --> 51:31.833
That's not fair. I lost my money
long before I was kicked out.

51:34.208 --> 51:36.125
My father was the nobleman.

51:37.291 --> 51:41.458
He expected me to have a disposition
of a diplomat like my brothers.

51:42.083 --> 51:45.250
But I was impetuous.
Short temper, rash judgment.

51:45.333 --> 51:48.083
-That's why I like fighting.
-[scoffs] You? No.

51:48.875 --> 51:53.500
Well, if we've moved onto the emotional
story-swapping part of our friendship,

51:54.083 --> 51:56.125
I think we'd have got on as kids.

51:56.208 --> 51:59.791
We may have burned down a town
or two on accident, but… still.

52:06.208 --> 52:10.541
When the Usurper took Nilfgaard,
he enslaved my father and my brothers.

52:11.208 --> 52:15.125
He was afraid of their strength and their
ability to someday take revenge, but…

52:15.958 --> 52:16.916
but I was…

52:17.958 --> 52:19.958
I was just a little boy, I was…

52:20.958 --> 52:22.500
too weak for concern.

52:22.583 --> 52:24.375
I was left to starve or die.

52:24.458 --> 52:27.416
Cahir, I've known you to march into battle

52:27.500 --> 52:31.666
with little more than a breastplate made
of chicken bones and a stick for a sword.

52:31.750 --> 52:34.666
Fuck the Usurper. He was an idiot.

52:35.250 --> 52:38.375
That's what the White Flame said to me
when he came to free me.

52:39.583 --> 52:42.083
"The Usurper was a fool
to let you go, son,

52:42.583 --> 52:44.708
because you are the strongest
of them all."

52:44.791 --> 52:47.166
Well, I suppose you're strong
for a scrawny little--

52:49.041 --> 52:50.875
[mournful music]

52:52.666 --> 52:54.041
[choking]

53:04.458 --> 53:05.458
[Cahir] I'm sorry.

53:06.041 --> 53:08.500
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.583
[sobbing]

53:14.875 --> 53:16.875
[wind whistling]

53:19.416 --> 53:21.416
[sighing sounds]

53:24.000 --> 53:25.291
[Cahir groans]

53:40.416 --> 53:42.416
[birds calling]

53:43.666 --> 53:45.666
-[wind sighing]
-[horse galloping]

53:51.458 --> 53:52.666
[neighs]

53:54.708 --> 53:56.708
[dramatic music]

54:00.500 --> 54:02.416
[thunder crashing]

54:09.500 --> 54:11.125
[thunder booming]

54:15.958 --> 54:17.916
[frightened neighing]

54:22.708 --> 54:24.125
[whispering voice] Ciri…

54:25.291 --> 54:26.500
[wind whistling]

54:30.041 --> 54:32.000
[wind howling]

54:32.750 --> 54:34.458
[hooves thundering]

54:35.083 --> 54:37.125
[Eredin] Cirilla!

54:37.625 --> 54:40.083
Cirilla!

54:43.291 --> 54:44.583
-[deep voice] Cirilla!
-[neighing]

54:44.666 --> 54:47.416
[Eredin] Cirilla!

54:52.125 --> 54:54.375
No. You're ghosts. Corpses.

54:54.958 --> 54:59.791
Yes, we are corpses,
but you are death itself!

55:05.875 --> 55:07.625
Join us.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.666
[yells]

55:15.875 --> 55:17.833
[horses screaming]

55:17.916 --> 55:19.916
[roaring]

55:26.583 --> 55:27.875
You found me.

55:34.250 --> 55:36.250
[foreboding music]

55:55.708 --> 55:56.833
They were real.
