25:27.040 --> 25:28.720
Please. It's not too late.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.000
Actually, I think it is.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.280
You're just gonna sit there,
sit there and watch me die?

25:52.760 --> 25:53.760
Maybe you...

25:54.240 --> 25:55.640
you would rather be alone?

25:59.360 --> 26:00.360
(WHIMPERING)

26:01.280 --> 26:02.880
But I don't want to die.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.680
And there's nothing
anyone can do about that.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.120
What the fuck is wrong with you?

26:15.920 --> 26:17.040
I think I...

26:18.440 --> 26:20.600
I don't feel things
like other people do.

26:21.240 --> 26:25.160
Except with Emily, like she makes me
feel things I've never felt before.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.440
I think I love her.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.240
Do you think she loves me, too?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.080
I hope you fucking die.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
You first.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.560
(EXHALES)

28:19.600 --> 28:21.200
CATHERINE: (IN FRENCH) It's beautiful.
VICTOR: Yes.

28:21.280 --> 28:25.400
When I see this, it makes me glad
you stopped me taking my own life.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.120
I spent too much time
looking at the stars.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.240
I didn't see things
that were right in front of me.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.520
We are all guilty of that.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.560
I wish I'd told my wife that I loved her
more often.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.800
I should have told my children
that I was proud of them.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.720
The animals need feeding.
The cows needed milking.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.400
There was always something else to do.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.800
Always.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.120
Did you take the pill?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.320
Not yet.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.840
What?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.520
What are you doing?
You're styling my hair now?

29:37.720 --> 29:40.120
I remember when they brought you home
from the hospital.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.440
You remember that?

29:43.160 --> 29:44.760
Of course.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.080
You were so small.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.520
So beautiful.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.840
I was desperate to hold you...

29:59.320 --> 30:01.440
You should keep the baby.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.520
You said I should get rid of it?

30:05.880 --> 30:07.120
What do I know?

30:08.760 --> 30:14.440
I know about stars, and equations.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.320
What if I can't keep them safe?

30:21.200 --> 30:22.720
We'll go to London.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.000
I'll work out how to change things.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.040
I'll do it for you and your baby.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.720
You don't even know if you can...

30:30.800 --> 30:31.880
I can try.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.080
I want another chance.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.280
What do you mean?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.720
I was a rubbish big sister to you.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.280
Not completely.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.760
I'll try and be a much better aunt.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.760
You should keep the baby.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.280
I want to but...

31:09.000 --> 31:10.480
I'm scared.

31:10.880 --> 31:15.240
I need a reason for doing this.

31:16.880 --> 31:21.160
We'll make a better future for you,
for you and your baby.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.360
Don't make a decision you might regret.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.600
Okay.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.360
You're going to keep it?

31:46.440 --> 31:47.440
Yes.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.440
You're going to be a great mum...

31:52.920 --> 31:54.800
This kid better not take after me.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.440
I hope it's just like you.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.240
What's going on?

32:06.520 --> 32:07.520
What?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.480
I'm pregnant.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.560
How?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.560
You need me to draw you a diagram?

32:29.360 --> 32:30.360
(BOTH LAUGH)

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
I love you.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.960
I love you too.

JONATHAN: Yeah.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.160

33:39.720 --> 33:40.880
TOM: I haven't seen him.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.840
-What, no one's seen him?
-No.

33:44.760 --> 33:45.800
What's going on?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.400
(IN FRENCH) Ash is dead.
Someone stabbed him.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.080
(IN ENGLISH) Was it you?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.320
-What?
-No!

33:55.320 --> 33:57.080
You already tried to kill Bill.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.200
I didn't do it.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.880
-It wasn't her.
-Hmm, are you sure?

34:05.560 --> 34:07.120
Let's go, come on.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.040
You think I killed Ash?

34:12.760 --> 34:13.760
No.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.600
(IN FRENCH)
We'll be in Calais around midday.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.640
You think it's safe?

34:40.080 --> 34:41.080
No.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.640
ZOE: (IN ENGLISH) Anything?
JONATHAN: He's not up there.

34:54.720 --> 34:57.640
There's no sign of Bill.
You think they took him?

34:57.720 --> 34:58.720
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

34:59.760 --> 35:01.920
Why would they only kill Ash
and not the rest of us?

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
Shit!

35:22.480 --> 35:24.240
I hate seeing you like this.

35:27.640 --> 35:28.960
I'm okay. (SNIFFLES)

35:33.120 --> 35:34.840
Do you want to be on your own?

35:35.920 --> 35:38.880
No. Stay.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.160
I'm sorry about Ash.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.200
Were you close?

36:01.360 --> 36:02.680
We used to be.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.600
After I came off the ship,
he didn't know what to say to me.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.400
(SOBBING) Even my mum thinks
I killed him.

36:16.120 --> 36:18.080
Tom's scared of me.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.640
Maybe he should be?

36:21.200 --> 36:24.920
Maybe it's better
if everyone just stays away from me.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.040
I know how it feels
when people think you're a freak.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.360
Why would anyone think that about you?

36:39.520 --> 36:41.080
I didn't really fit in at school.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.360
People thought I was weird.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.400
Sometimes even my mum doesn't like me.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.480
I'm sure that's not true.

36:56.240 --> 36:59.200
She sees my father in me. She hates it.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.760
She blames you? That's not fair.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.120
It's not her fault.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.840
My father was cruel to her.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.720
I'm sorry.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.040
I feel like you're the only person
who understands me.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.280

No. No. I'm just confused.
