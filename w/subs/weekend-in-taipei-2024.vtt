Raymond. Good morning.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.923
Can I help you with something?

26:16.923 --> 26:18.968
Oh, I'm just looking
for a pencil sharpener.

Hmm.

Hey, how about we go play
golf together sometime, huh?

26:31.241 --> 26:32.808
No.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.289
Raymond.

Ooh, we've got time for a late

Stop it!
Don't have him killed!

[Joey sobbing]

29:07.484 --> 29:08.659
- W-- Why?

29:08.659 --> 29:11.271
- Because our beloved son
is the snitch.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.489
No.

29:12.968 --> 29:15.057
- I don't believe it.
- Well, believe it.

29:15.057 --> 29:17.146
He's trying to ruin me.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.669
Destroy everything we've built.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.802
You're wrong. You're wrong.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.283
You promised to protect us.

29:23.283 --> 29:26.155
Sweetheart, I am trying
to protect us.

You think you're so clever,

Is this true?
Give it back! Give it back.

- Dolphins?
- [Raymond] His processing
plants--

29:46.872 --> 29:48.612
You did this because
of some dolphins?

29:48.612 --> 29:50.789
You're destroying our ecosystem!

29:51.180 --> 29:52.616
I had to do something.

29:52.616 --> 29:55.358
Good for you.
Taking initiative.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.187
But where is my ledger?

29:58.187 --> 30:02.409
Because the rest of it has
nothing to do with any dolphins!

30:02.409 --> 30:04.280
[screaming] Leave me!

30:04.541 --> 30:08.807
Kwang? Just give me a minute.
I'll talk to him.

Please?

30:11.592 --> 30:13.202
Okay.

30:17.163 --> 30:20.079
Just tell him.
Hey, it's fine.

30:20.079 --> 30:22.777
Just tell him
what's going on, hon.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.997
Please, Mom. Five minutes.

30:24.997 --> 30:27.434
I just need five minutes.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.566
I need to get the ledger
to Lawlor.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.264
What?

30:31.264 --> 30:33.309
Some agent, John Lawlor.

30:33.309 --> 30:35.181
[Joey gasps]

30:35.181 --> 30:36.965
[Raymond] John Lawlor. [panting]

30:36.965 --> 30:40.926
He emailed me back.
I just need five more minutes.

30:41.013 --> 30:44.233
- What are you talking about?
- Mom, please.

30:44.581 --> 30:46.018
Five minutes.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.541
What?

30:47.541 --> 30:50.239
- Please, Mom.
- No. No, what-- what--

30:50.239 --> 30:51.675
Oh my God.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.896
Oh! What are you talking about?

30:54.983 --> 30:56.245
- Please, Mom.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.899
- [Kwang] Okay,
that's enough, now.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.683
All right.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.816
Five minutes.

31:07.778 --> 31:10.085
- Hit me.
- What?

31:10.085 --> 31:12.958
It's the only way he'll talk.
Now, hit me.

31:15.482 --> 31:16.787
I won't hit you.

[clock ticking]

31:31.367 --> 31:32.891
[lighter clicks]

31:36.459 --> 31:38.287
It's filthy.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.117
And a burnt smell
gets into your hair,

31:42.117 --> 31:44.685
your clothes, your fingernails.

31:46.078 --> 31:49.298
No matter what you do,
you just can't get rid of it.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.390
It's awful.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.091
But when we got married,

32:01.702 --> 32:03.530
I had to start.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.532
The smoking smell
is nothing compared

32:05.532 --> 32:08.100
to the smell of my husband.

32:08.883 --> 32:12.974
The smell of sweaty desperation.
It makes me gag.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.629
[ropes rustle]

32:15.629 --> 32:17.674

or how much money he spends,

32:20.982 --> 32:22.984
or how much he scrubs,

32:23.376 --> 32:26.161
the putrid stink...

32:26.814 --> 32:29.338
[clock ticking]

32:29.643 --> 32:31.210
...never goes away.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.197

33:02.197 --> 33:04.547
- Now, you tell me.
Where is my ledger?

33:04.547 --> 33:05.592
- [Joey] Stop! Stop!

33:05.592 --> 33:06.636
Don't touch him!
- Hmm?

33:06.636 --> 33:07.986
- [Joey screaming]

33:07.986 --> 33:09.204
- I gave you everything.
And you do this to me?

33:09.204 --> 33:10.510
- Don't touch--

33:10.510 --> 33:12.251
- [Raymond] Stop. Stop.
Please, stop.

33:12.251 --> 33:14.340
I'll tell you where the ledger
is. Just stop it.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.385
[Joey] Stop it! [sobbing]

33:16.385 --> 33:19.867
I had a friend take the ledger
to the Marriott Hotel.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.174
It's Room 2018.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.219
What do you mean, "had"?

33:29.572 --> 33:31.618
Hey, John. Get involved.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.489
- They ain't got chicken feet
like this in Minnesota.

33:33.489 --> 33:34.751
- You got xiaolongbao?

33:34.751 --> 33:37.102
No. We got shumai, though.
You like shumai?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.929

- [Simmons] What's that?

34:10.396 --> 34:12.876
All this for a little red book?

34:12.876 --> 34:14.791
You took too many guns.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.620
Go find the ledger.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.708
[bodyguards] Yes.

You! Keep her.
You! Come with me.

- Mom.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.635
anybody that would
break the law...

34:33.941 --> 34:37.684
- Mommy! -...was forever
marked as a criminal.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.861
- [Raymond] Mom!
- No! No! No!

34:40.861 --> 34:43.516
[Kwang] And depending on
the severity of the crime...

34:43.516 --> 34:47.607
No! Oh, no! Please! Please!
Stop! No! No! No!

34:47.607 --> 34:49.261
...they were cut into quarters.

Sweetheart.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.643
What, you're killing people now?

35:23.643 --> 35:24.992
Let us go!

35:24.992 --> 35:26.950
You're not gonna shoot me.

Who's gonna protect you?

[engine revving loudly]

35:41.965 --> 35:43.358
Mom, slow down.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.838
Where'd you learn
how to drive like this?

35:44.838 --> 35:46.318
Gotta get to the hotel.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.494
- Warn him.
- What? Warn who?

You two do anything but fight?

52:56.695 --> 52:57.957
- [Joey] Yes.
- No.

52:57.957 --> 52:59.611
[knock at door]

52:59.611 --> 53:03.049
Mrs. Kwang? Some of our
patients wanna say thank you.

53:05.225 --> 53:06.313
- [Joey in Chinese]
Oh, thank you.

53:06.313 --> 53:07.619
- Why all the flowers?

53:07.619 --> 53:09.229
[doctor] Mrs. Kwang
is our biggest donor.

53:09.229 --> 53:11.231
Actually, the only donor.

53:11.231 --> 53:14.278
Thanks to her, we have
the best hospital in the area.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.280
She saved countless lives.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.846
[Joey] I have to go.

53:19.283 --> 53:20.762
Let's go.

53:21.459 --> 53:23.025
Yeah, Raymond.

53:23.025 --> 53:24.679
[Joey in Chinese] Thank you all.

53:24.679 --> 53:26.246
- [doctor in Chinese] Thank you.
- [in English] Appreciate it.

[Po Po gasps]

54:04.023 --> 54:06.852
[in Chinese]
I left him. I did it.

54:06.852 --> 54:07.940
Mom, who's this?

54:07.940 --> 54:09.724
Come here.

54:10.290 --> 54:11.944
Raymond!

54:11.944 --> 54:13.902
[in Chinese]
How much you've grown.

54:13.902 --> 54:15.295
[laughing]

54:15.295 --> 54:17.558
My grandmother.
Your great-grandmother.

54:18.733 --> 54:21.083
[in Chinese] Granny, we're
going to change our clothes.

54:21.083 --> 54:22.171
[in English] Let's go clean up.

54:22.171 --> 54:27.264
[♪]

54:33.270 --> 54:34.793
Sorry.

54:40.799 --> 54:41.843
Whoa.

[♪]

54:48.763 --> 54:50.461
Mom, is this where you grew up?

54:50.461 --> 54:52.158
I know it's not much.

54:52.158 --> 54:53.681
Are you kidding?
This is awesome.

54:53.681 --> 54:55.379
Why have you never
brought me here before?

54:55.466 --> 54:57.729
Sometimes it's easier
to forget the past.

54:57.729 --> 55:00.949
Get out of those stinky clothes.
Dinner soon.

55:05.214 --> 55:08.174
Hey, uh, do you have some water?

55:08.174 --> 55:10.045
Water?

55:14.876 --> 55:16.400
Fridge?

55:22.319 --> 55:24.582
I see you still
know your way around.

55:24.582 --> 55:26.366
I don't remember this.

55:26.366 --> 55:28.542
Po Po hates Kwang's money too.

55:28.542 --> 55:31.719
But she likes cold beer more.
Change.

55:35.723 --> 55:40.293
[birds squawking]

55:54.481 --> 55:56.744
Oh. Hi, Joey.

55:56.744 --> 55:58.485
[Joey] Hi!

55:59.965 --> 56:03.882
Mom, anything else you wanna
tell me about our family?

56:03.882 --> 56:05.579
Say hello to your cousin,
Raymond.

56:05.579 --> 56:07.842
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

56:07.842 --> 56:10.279
- Hi, Po Po.
- Put it there.

56:11.542 --> 56:12.804
- You're not eating?

56:12.804 --> 56:14.501
- [Raymond] Not until
I get some answers.

56:14.501 --> 56:16.373
I just found out that I have
a great-grandmother, a cousin.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.983
What else aren't you telling me?

56:17.983 --> 56:21.595
You never talk about family.
You never talk about the past.

56:21.595 --> 56:23.815
I know nothing about you,
both of you.

56:23.815 --> 56:26.470
So please, no more lies.

56:26.470 --> 56:28.036
I deserve to know.

56:28.036 --> 56:29.647
He's right.

56:31.431 --> 56:32.954
Fine.

56:34.652 --> 56:36.393
When your mom was young,

56:36.958 --> 56:39.134
I wasn't exactly who you think.

56:39.134 --> 56:41.789
<i>Both my parents died
in fishing accidents,</i>

56:41.789 --> 56:44.139
<i>so Po Po refused to
let me near the water.</i>

56:44.139 --> 56:47.839
So, I have to find
something else to do.

56:49.362 --> 56:50.755
Joey!

57:00.634 --> 57:03.158
- [in Chinese] It's dangerous.
- [in Chinese] Can you slow down?

57:03.158 --> 57:05.291
Turns out I was
a really good mechanic.

57:05.291 --> 57:07.598
I could do anything with cars.

57:07.859 --> 57:10.992
<i>Which was fun, but not
very useful in the village.</i>

57:10.992 --> 57:13.734
- [in Chinese] Wash up.
Dinnertime. -[Joey
in Chinese] Okay.

57:13.734 --> 57:17.825
Until one day,
something terrible happened.

57:17.825 --> 57:22.177
[ominous music]

57:28.749 --> 57:30.490
[in Chinese]
Put them into my garage.

57:30.490 --> 57:32.536
[Joey] <i>But Po Po was smart.</i>

57:32.623 --> 57:36.453
<i>If she went to the police,
they might arrest the villagers.</i>

57:36.453 --> 57:40.718
<i>By hiding the drugs,
she could keep everyone safe.</i>

57:41.153 --> 57:45.853
<i>Until the day the gang
came to get them back.</i>

57:47.681 --> 57:54.688
[♪]

58:01.390 --> 58:04.568
- [knocking at door]
- [in Chinese] Joey, wake up.

58:04.655 --> 58:07.832
[Joey] <i>When these men
came to the small villages,</i>

58:07.832 --> 58:10.704
<i>they would not just
take back their merchandise.</i>

58:10.704 --> 58:14.491
<i>They would also take away
all the young girls.</i>

58:15.013 --> 58:17.711
But lucky for me, I could drive.

[shouts]

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.875
And then what happened?

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.833
I was offered a job.

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.705
A job? What kind of job?

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:24.229
Only thing I was good at.
Driving.

01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:27.058
And then a few years later,
I met your dad.

01:00:27.058 --> 01:00:28.407
These are really good dumplings.

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:31.323
John. Your turn.

01:00:31.976 --> 01:00:33.891
All right.
What do you wanna know?

01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.849
How did you two meet?

01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:38.199
- Can't remember.
It was so long ago.

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:39.636
- John. Tell the truth.

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.861
- It was a work thing.
- What kind of work thing?

01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:49.558
[clears throat]

01:00:49.558 --> 01:00:51.691
I was a cop. A DEA agent.

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:54.520
I was sent over here undercover
to track a drug shipment.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.914
And, uh,
I was pretending to be a client,

01:00:56.914 --> 01:00:59.351
following the mule car
that was transporting drugs.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:02.397
<i>And it turned out that
the driver of the car was</i>

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:04.530
<i>none other than your mother.</i>

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.271
What?

01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:08.360
- These are really good
dumplings. -Yeah,
they are, huh?

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.318
Yeah,
you should get you some more.

01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:15.454
Now, she thought I was a
competitor trying to
steal her drugs.

- No.

Well, how do you remember it?

01:01:58.105 --> 01:02:01.152
First, I remember his shoes.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.460
[grunting]

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.204
Can't really remember his face.
I don't know why.

I do remember our first kiss.

You sure that was
our first kiss?

Yes, I remember it.
Why don't you?

- Oof. You're in trouble now.
- No, no, no. Hold on.

Um, okay, I may not
remember our first kiss,

No, no.

01:02:55.249 --> 01:02:56.468
our fifth.

01:02:56.468 --> 01:02:58.470
Oh, yeah.

01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:00.951

- More dumplings?
- Yeah.

01:03:10.395 --> 01:03:13.267
I don't understand. What
happens? Why did
you break up?

01:03:13.267 --> 01:03:15.879
Some people just--
they can't make up their mind.

01:03:15.966 --> 01:03:17.794
Some people care only about
one thing, their career.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.318
Yeah, but some people's jobs
are about saving people.

01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:22.537
And for some people, that's
easier than raising a family.

01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:25.279
It's a little difficult when no
one tells you that you
have a family.

01:03:25.279 --> 01:03:27.499
Excuses.
[in Chinese] Weasel out of it.

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:29.109

I think I've heard enough.

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:32.373

- Yeah.

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:33.592
Okay.

01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:36.987
- Help me clean up.
- Sure, Mom.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.511
You too. Please.

01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:42.209
Yeah, of course.

[in Chinese] Thanks.

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:09.236
Hey. You seen your mom?

01:04:09.236 --> 01:04:13.458
- Morning to you too.
- Sorry, man. Good morning.

[clears throat]

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:25.687
So, uh... you like cooking?

01:04:25.687 --> 01:04:27.080
Not really.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.690
So why are you studying?

01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:34.392
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry to disappoint.

01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:40.180
That was a brave thing you did,
stealing the ledger.

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:42.966
Just wanted Kwang
to stop killing dolphins.

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:44.881
Yeah, I hear you.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.884
Actually, I saved some fish the
other day. There was
this big fire--

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:51.626
Dolphins aren't fish. They're
mammals, just like
you and me.

01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:54.020
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.850
Well, these were definitely
fish. You know, that
little cute ones.

01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:01.288
I interned for Kwang
last semester.

01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:03.160
That's when I found out

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.903
that his fishing boats kill
over 650,000 dolphins a year.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.643
They get caught up in the nets.

01:05:08.643 --> 01:05:11.646
And the fishermen actually chop
them up and used
them as bait.

01:05:11.646 --> 01:05:14.780
Kwang's a piece of shit
dickhead dolphin killer.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.000
Hey, hey,
watch your language, kid.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.697
Okay, Dad.

01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:21.439
Sorry, I meant John.

01:05:21.439 --> 01:05:23.745

01:05:24.268 --> 01:05:26.052
Cut me some slack, huh?

01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.794
It's not that
I don't wanna be Dad,

01:05:28.794 --> 01:05:33.320
it's just, you know, it's just--
this is all new to me.

01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:36.802
Yeah, well,
I'm not really an expert either.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.373
Pretty good at these beans,
though, huh?

- Stay here.
- All right.

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:02.132
Hey. I've been looking for you.

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:05.309
I was in town getting
some spare parts for the buggy.

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:07.267
We're meant to hide, remember?

01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:09.791
Don't worry, I know how to hide.

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:13.273
But you, you're the expert.
You're really good at it.

01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:16.624
All right, can we, uh,
take some time out for a minute?

01:06:16.624 --> 01:06:19.410
There's a lot of details
in your story that are missing.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.281
Just fill me in.

01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:24.937
- What happened to you after I
left? -My past is
mine, not yours.

01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:33.206
You know what? Don't tell me.

01:06:33.206 --> 01:06:35.426
Just, you know, keep all
your secrets to yourself.

01:06:35.426 --> 01:06:37.036
But just know that one day

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.298
they will come around and
they will bite you in the ass.

01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:40.213
Do you remember the last time?

01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:41.649
- What?

01:06:41.649 --> 01:06:44.174
- Do you remember the last time
we saw each other?

01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:46.654
Yeah, of course I do.

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:48.874
All I ever do is
remember that night.

01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:51.355
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:06:58.492 --> 01:07:00.320
- I got something
I need to tell--

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.235
- Oh, sorry.
- No, you first.

01:07:02.235 --> 01:07:05.630
No, you go.
Yours sounds more serious.

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:07.588
Mine can wait.

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:10.939
I'm not a buyer.

01:07:11.984 --> 01:07:13.290
I'm not even a client.

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:17.033
- [laughs]
- I'm an undercover agent.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:21.080
I work for the DEA.
My real name is John Lawlor.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.607
I was sent here to
dig into Kwang's operation,

01:07:27.086 --> 01:07:29.219
figure out the players,
who he's working for,

01:07:29.219 --> 01:07:31.090
who's working for him.

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:33.005
The worst part is, uh...

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:36.704
they want me to bring you in.

01:07:38.271 --> 01:07:40.534
I-- I don't understand.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:45.017
You were using me?

01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.064
Yeah.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.717
At first I was.

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:52.590
But then
I fell in love with you.

01:07:53.286 --> 01:07:54.809
Deeply.

01:07:57.290 --> 01:07:59.988
I thought, uh,
when the time came,

01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:03.688
I could just protect you,
protect us.

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:07.909
[voice distorting]
The system is rigged.

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:10.651
They just need someone
to blame, and, uh...

01:08:10.651 --> 01:08:12.827
it's never the shark, you know?

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:17.267
It's always the little fish,
and that's not gonna help.

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:20.835
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:22.794
[normally] Listen to me.

01:08:22.794 --> 01:08:24.361
You're gonna get up from here,

01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:25.797
you're gonna walk
to the bathroom,

01:08:25.797 --> 01:08:27.538
you're gonna crawl
out the window.

01:08:27.538 --> 01:08:29.496
- No.
- You're gonna take my car,

01:08:29.496 --> 01:08:31.759
and you're gonna drive away
from here as fast as you can.

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:33.196
Where should I go?

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:35.633
I-- Just go wherever.

01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:36.938
Wherever you want.

01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:39.985
Just disappear, okay? Use cash.

01:08:39.985 --> 01:08:42.292
I will scrub your records.
Don't leave a trace.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:45.904
- No way for anyone to find you.
- How will you find me?

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.298
I won't.

01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:52.171
[sobbing]

01:08:54.869 --> 01:08:57.785
- No. No.
- Please. You have to go.

01:08:57.785 --> 01:08:59.744
No, John.

01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:02.225
No. No.

01:09:02.312 --> 01:09:04.792
Joey, please, go. Now.

01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:12.626
That's not exactly
how it happened.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.325
Well, that's how I remember it.

01:09:16.978 --> 01:09:19.416
You never wondered
what my news was?

01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:22.158
Never wondered
what I had to say?

01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:31.863
Congratulations.

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:33.386
[Joey] Thank you.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:45.268
[sirens blaring]

01:09:45.355 --> 01:09:50.447
[♪]

01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:56.017
[sobbing]

01:09:59.456 --> 01:10:03.373
[muted screaming]

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:06.680
So you knew?

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.292
You knew you were pregnant
and you didn't tell me?

01:10:09.379 --> 01:10:10.641
You said go, get out.

01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.425
But if I knew...

01:10:12.425 --> 01:10:15.298
Then what?
You arrest me?

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:16.864
Raymond is born in prison?

01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.605
- No, thank you.
- So, what, you--

01:10:18.605 --> 01:10:20.128
You run to someone like Kwang?

01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:22.696
You don't get to
judge my choices.

01:10:23.044 --> 01:10:27.310
I did what I had to do
to protect my son.

01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:29.442
I sacrificed everything.

01:10:29.442 --> 01:10:30.704
So did I.

01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:32.053
I sacrificed you.

01:10:32.053 --> 01:10:34.491
The one thing
in my life that meant a damn.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:42.238
Okay, okay.

01:10:43.282 --> 01:10:44.805
Fine.

01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:48.635
You want to be part
of this family?

01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:50.724
- I do.
- You sure?

01:10:50.724 --> 01:10:52.248
I'm sure.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.381
And no more secrets,
everything out in the open.

01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:56.556
I can do that.

01:10:56.556 --> 01:10:58.297
If it doesn't work, we stop.

01:10:58.297 --> 01:10:59.994
I don't want Raymond
getting hurt.

01:10:59.994 --> 01:11:01.953
Neither do I.

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:04.303
And we take it slow.

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:07.828
That's fine by me.

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:15.749
[♪]

01:11:16.097 --> 01:11:18.448
[Joey sniffling]

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.972
[phone buzzing]

01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.772
- What?
<i>- The police want</i>

01:11:38.772 --> 01:11:41.558
<i>to talk to you about
the shootout at the hotel.</i>

01:11:41.949 --> 01:11:44.082
<i>Kwang, this is serious.</i>

01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:45.910
<i>What do I tell them?</i>

01:11:54.005 --> 01:11:59.489
[slow, tense instrumental]

01:12:11.718 --> 01:12:16.332
[♪]

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:21.337
[music intensifies]

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:32.739
[♪]

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.230
[knocking on door]

01:12:46.753 --> 01:12:49.103
- Yes.
- See?

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:50.453
That's how it's done.

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:52.237
Knock, wait, then enter.

01:12:52.237 --> 01:12:54.587
Good.
What's up?

01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:56.328
Just looking for John.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.417
- Huh?
- You know John.

01:12:58.417 --> 01:13:00.245
Tall, grumpy guy, hates smiling,

01:13:00.245 --> 01:13:01.855
not dead, not a chef.

01:13:01.855 --> 01:13:03.901
Yeah, I'm sorry. Um...

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.643
I haven't seen him at all... no.

01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:09.559
- You all right, Mom?
- Yes, I'm fine. Yeah.

01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:11.256
Why are you looking for John?

01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:13.301
[Raymond] I was pretty harsh
on him yesterday.

01:13:13.301 --> 01:13:14.999
Just wanted to say sorry.

01:13:14.999 --> 01:13:17.218
[Joey sighs] Don't worry.
He's a tough guy.

01:13:17.218 --> 01:13:18.611
Yeah, I know.

01:13:18.611 --> 01:13:20.570
Still thought
he'd want to hear it though.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.398
[Joey] He's probably in the
mountains, getting his work out.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.748
- Okay. Thanks.
- [Joey] Yeah.

01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:28.099
[sighing]

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:31.972
I do not hate smiling.

01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:33.278
- I love smiling.
- Really?

01:13:33.278 --> 01:13:34.932
- Yeah.
Show me.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:38.022
All right. Well, this is
my "Pizza for dinner"smile.

01:13:38.022 --> 01:13:39.589
- [Joey giggling]
- And this...

01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:44.245
is I found passports
and $10,000 in cash smile.

01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:46.247
Give me that.

01:13:46.247 --> 01:13:47.640
You said no more secrets.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.642
Fine. It's our escape plan.

01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:52.036
Some traveling cash,
fake passports.

01:13:52.036 --> 01:13:53.646
Everything we need to get away.

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:55.518
- Except...
- Except what?

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:58.521
I only have passports
for me and Ray.

01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:01.132
Don't worry.
We're not gonna split up.

01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:03.177
I'm not gonna lose you again.

01:14:03.177 --> 01:14:06.050
[Joey screaming, giggling]

01:14:08.922 --> 01:14:11.447
[Liu] This incident
at the hotel,

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:14.711
six of your bodyguards
were found there.

01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:16.234
What time was the incident?

01:14:16.234 --> 01:14:19.759
Around, uh, 5, 6 pm.

01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:21.805
Hm.

01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:24.024
That is hard to explain,

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.113
But, Deputy Liu, you know,

01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:28.986
this doesn't seem like
any of my concern.

01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:34.208
But as you can see, my employees
clocked out at 4 p.m.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:36.602
and what my employees do
on their personal time

01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:39.649
is their business, not mine.

01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:42.216
How do we know these are real?

01:14:42.216 --> 01:14:44.567
Deputy, the real question
you should be asking is

01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:46.873
who killed my poor employees?

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:48.527
Why question me

01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:51.661
when there's a real murderer
running out there free?

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.402
Makes me think of
the Chinese proverb:

01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:57.144
Why kill the chicken
to scare the monkey.

01:14:57.144 --> 01:15:00.147
Are you a chicken
or a monkey, Mister Kwang?

01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:03.411
You know, it sounds to me like
you're dealing with a real pro.

01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:07.024
Someone that is trained
with a unique set of skills.

01:15:07.415 --> 01:15:09.417
You know,
if anyone should be a suspect,

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:10.636
it's this person, not me.

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:13.509
You mean the American,
George Washington.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.336
George Washington.

01:15:15.859 --> 01:15:17.948
George Washington...

01:15:19.427 --> 01:15:22.605
Not George Washington!

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:27.566
Meet Agent John Lawlor.

01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:30.047
My men sacrificed their lives

01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:32.615
trying to stop him from
kidnapping my wife.

01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:34.312
Why would he do this?

01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:38.534
Because this John Lawlor
conceived a child with my wife.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.753
The very child
I've been raising as

01:15:40.753 --> 01:15:43.930
my own son for
the past 13 years.

01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:50.371
His first case here in Taipei
was here to investigate me.

01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:53.940
We will see.

01:15:54.724 --> 01:15:56.290
Please look into it.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.086
Any news?

01:16:09.086 --> 01:16:11.436
Looking everywhere.
Finding nothing.

01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:13.960
Check their airports,
train stations.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.571
All staked out.

01:16:15.962 --> 01:16:17.398
Try her village.

01:16:17.398 --> 01:16:19.749
She said she never go back,
but you never know.

01:16:20.227 --> 01:16:25.581
[♪]

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:31.848
[John] Listen to me
very carefully.

01:16:31.848 --> 01:16:34.067
This is really important, okay?

01:16:34.067 --> 01:16:36.679
Kwang's ledger.
Were there any others?

01:16:36.766 --> 01:16:38.419
I don't know. Maybe.

01:16:38.419 --> 01:16:40.291
I didn't see any other ledgers.

01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:41.771
There's only one.

01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:44.948
He's in control
if we can't find hard evidence,

01:16:44.948 --> 01:16:46.253
Kwang's not smart enough

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:48.081
to keep all that
information in his head.

01:16:48.081 --> 01:16:50.997
Well, I was in his study
one afternoon.

01:16:51.998 --> 01:16:53.173
Maybe it was the rhino.

01:16:53.173 --> 01:16:55.001
He has
a rhino sculpture on his desk.

01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:56.437
What if it's not
a sculpture at all?

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:58.396
- It's a hard drive.
- I can go get it.

01:16:58.396 --> 01:16:59.702
No.

01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:01.878
- It'll be easy--
- [Joey & John] No.

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:05.446
- We'll find another way.
- What other way?

01:17:05.446 --> 01:17:08.058

Come on,
you're such a taskmaster.

01:33:38.874 --> 01:33:40.702
