WEBVTT

00:24.482 --> 00:28.278
- Spotted them about an hour ago.
- Why are they moving like that?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.157
No reason.

00:34.242 --> 00:37.746
Wrong.
There is reason for everything.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.044
What about you, Dixon?

00:46.588 --> 00:48.214
You ever seen rotters
move like that?

00:49.716 --> 00:51.426
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that before.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.304
South of here.
I don't know why it happens.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.306
They just gather up a whole bunch
of them and move on.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.435
Could take them down.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.605
Like we did at that hospital
in Rockville. Easy.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.024
Till you almost bought it and
I had to save your ass.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.734
That was just when things
were getting fun.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.655
I can lead them out about two miles,
just double back.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.865
Less work, less risk.

01:13.865 --> 01:14.949
Yeah, less balls.

01:22.832 --> 01:24.209
We'll try it Dixon's way.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.212
- All right.
- Wells.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.133
- Think you can move those rotters?
- Yes, sir.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.595
- I can do it. I've done it before.
- Wells can handle it.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.325
Hey, Pied Piper. How's the piping?

01:59.994 --> 02:03.540
You kidding? I'm the belle
of the ball out here. They love me.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.584
All right, Belle.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.469
Step it up, ugly. It's getting late
and I'm getting hungry.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.640
Come on. Come on.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.205
Sir, we have a situation here.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.666
What kind of situation?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.446
<i>Wells, do you copy?</i>

04:45.702 --> 04:48.663
- What's with that door?
- It's rotted out.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.457
This storm keeps up,
it'll shake apart.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.837
I'll check on the babies.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.384
It's only thunder.
It can't hurt you.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.555
You know what Mom said about storms?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.098
They're always followed
by clear skies.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.019
- I wish she was here.
- I know. Me too.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.572
Stay here.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.282
- Move.
- Okay, keep it closed.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.453
Is everyone okay?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.041
That's even worse.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.877
- What was that?
- Piece of the wall.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.796
Come on. Get back.

05:42.258 --> 05:46.387
Wells, it's Shaw. Do you copy? Over.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
- I'm going after him.
- There's no point.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.025
He's already dead.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.073
I've seen him
kill dozens of rotters at a time.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.741
They didn't kill him.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.329
She did.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.208
My enemy.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.255
Huh.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.884
So you did come back.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.266
You thought that woman
was out there?

06:32.517 --> 06:33.601
And you sent Paul in?

06:35.144 --> 06:37.480
- What was he, bait?
- He was a soldier.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.693
- Soldiers sometimes fall.
- No. He was more than that.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.780
- He was family.
- Yes.

06:46.906 --> 06:50.410
- Whose fate, God decided.
- God didn't send him out there.

06:51.994 --> 06:52.995
You did.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.585
A decision
you disagree with, Shaw?

07:07.427 --> 07:13.099
You have had a hell lot to say
ever since your boyfriend showed up.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.523
Anything else you wanna share?

07:27.029 --> 07:28.030
No, sir.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.618
Wells may have been your brother,

07:35.037 --> 07:36.539
but he was a son to me.

07:39.750 --> 07:44.255
And 'cause of his courage,
we now know the enemy is close.

07:45.047 --> 07:49.260
Well, I promise you,
they will not escape this time.

07:53.973 --> 07:58.269
Storm blew down one of the panels
in the wall over by the gardens.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.438
Hopefully, it's just the one.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.024
What's worse, there's a fire

08:03.524 --> 08:05.735
in the windmill that's drawing the
walkers from the surrounding areas.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.237
We need to get that panel back up
and the fire out.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.532
So, we're gonna need three teams.
I'll take one to fight the fire.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.534
And I'll take a crew
to repair the wall.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.662
We're gonna need another team
to protect everyone in here.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.499
- I can handle that.
- Okay, good.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.752
So, volunteers?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.633
No. You just got back.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.554
If she's up for it,
we could use the help.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.978
She wants to go with Carol.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.357
Thank you.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.653
Well, then I'm joining too.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.156
It's not up for discussion, sis.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.578
- I'll go with you.
- So will I.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.916
- Virgil, you can barely stand.
- I'd like to help.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.462
I can use all the help I can get.
Make sure nothing gets in.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.424
Yeah. Okay.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.428
- I'll stay here.
- All right. Let's move.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.810
I can go with you too.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.896
Thank you, Judith, but I'd prefer it
if you stayed here.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.147
I'm not scared.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.607
No, I know you're not,

09:26.857 --> 09:28.651
but I was really hoping
maybe you could help

09:28.651 --> 09:31.445
the other kids feel a little less afraid.
Can you do that for me?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.282
Good.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.951
I'll be back
in a while, sweetie.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.494
You do whatever Rosita tells you, okay?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.038
Why can't you stay
and have somebody else go?

09:42.456 --> 09:44.125
Because it wouldn't be fair of me

09:44.125 --> 09:46.377
to ask someone do something
I wouldn't do myself.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.547
- You understand?
- I can stay with you.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.342
Thank you.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.806
Let's move.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.322
Rotters are gone.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.618
But she's not.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.835
How long did you travel
with her for?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.339
- Not long at all.
- What can you tell me about her?

10:32.214 --> 10:33.215
Not-- Not much.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.261
Why am I keeping you around?

10:40.431 --> 10:41.515
You said God chose me.

10:47.855 --> 10:48.981
Oh, Dixon.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.277
I had this dog

10:55.363 --> 10:58.991
named him Tick,
on account he was a blue-tick hound.

10:59.825 --> 11:04.121
Found him on the side of the road.
He was starving, half dead.

11:05.081 --> 11:09.710
But the thing with some
of these rescues, like Tick,

11:10.795 --> 11:12.338
they don't trust easy.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.676
Sometimes I would reach for Tick
and he'd give me this look.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.762
That look.

11:20.221 --> 11:24.016
Like he couldn't decide whether
to lick my hand or bite it off.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.148
Don't worry. Ain't gonna lick you.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.490
There he is.

11:44.495 --> 11:48.332
Fair enough.
Just don't try to bite me either.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.379
Tick did. Hurt like hell having
to strangle that dog.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.305
We kept him here
'cause he's an excellent tracker.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.058
I'm sure he noticed something.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.603
She's a great shot.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.982
I know that. That's probably
how she took out Wells.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.278
So where would you look for her?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.904
Well, she's gonna
wanna see us coming.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.075
She's got that bow, so I'd look up.
The trees maybe.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.786
- Tree?
- Yeah.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.880
- We'll see.
<i>- Sir, they're back.</i>

13:05.367 --> 13:06.410
What is it?

13:08.829 --> 13:11.791
Somehow she has turned the dead
against the living.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.503
Oh, that's impressive.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.590
- How strong is this gate?
- Oh, it's strong enough.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.468
They won't get that far, though.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.743
We need more boards.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.162
Use the furniture.
Aaron will understand.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.831
I'll help.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.885
I wish I was more like you.
You're never afraid.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.557
That's not true.
I've been scared plenty of times.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.600
Never seems that way.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.813
That's 'cause I've learned
how to use my fear.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.608
- Use it?
- Yeah. You can too.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.193
My mom taught me.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.613
Just like how you can run faster
when you're scared,

14:25.447 --> 14:26.490
you can fight better too.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.325
It makes you stronger.

14:40.629 --> 14:41.755
She'd be proud of you.

14:46.927 --> 14:51.515
- Do you know where she went?
- I don't. I'm sorry.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.939
I haven't heard from her in so long.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.694
- I just wish she was here.
- She is.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.406
I see her in the way you hold your sword,

15:10.159 --> 15:11.994
the way you're ready
to run into the storm.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.584
And how you talk to those kids,
helping them believe in themselves.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.298
Your mom is still with you,

15:25.799 --> 15:30.512
and you can bet that wherever
she is, you're with her.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.521
Gracie, be careful.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.250
They're all over out there.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.836
Radio Carol. Tell her
there must be another breach.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.963
A close one. Go.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.132
Judith, candles, now.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.459
- What's on your mind, Shaw?
- Nothing.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.631
Come on. I know you better
than I know myself.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.592
What?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.054
I'm thinking of the ones we lost.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.648
- And you blame me.
- I didn't say that.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.652
"I will not offer to the lord my God

17:08.736 --> 17:10.863
"burnt offerings
that cost me nothing."

17:11.780 --> 17:13.282
These are all tribulations, Leah.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.912
The black horse of Famine,
it rides after us all.

17:20.581 --> 17:21.957
I knew this war was coming.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.797
And in every war there is sacrifice.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.803
That's why we were chosen
in the first place.

17:34.970 --> 17:39.308
'Cause we didn't run from the fires,
like we don't run from our enemies.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.352
Those men that died,

17:44.688 --> 17:45.981
they didn't die in vain.

17:51.153 --> 17:55.949
It's their sacrifice that shows
we are still worthy.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.456
That's why we will prevail.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.674
Man, you're missing
all the fireworks.

18:54.258 --> 18:57.010
Dixon? What are you doing up here?

18:57.136 --> 19:00.889
Pope told me to walk the perimeter,
so I'm walking the perimeter.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.476
- You want a smoke?
- Yeah.

19:09.940 --> 19:10.983
Here you go, man.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.071
Quit these once.
Guess I'll have to quit them again.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.698
Why?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.119
Here you go.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.100
<i>We're holding good at the northern gate.
Walls are holding strong.</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:46.268
Hi. Hi. Psst.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.352
Around that way. Go.

21:02.844 --> 21:03.845
Where were you?

21:04.805 --> 21:07.307
- Just want to be ready.
- Well, you're not gonna need them.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.685
The rotters are scattered.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.562
You sure about that?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.829
My enemy never gives up.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.999
Secure the gate. Shaw...

21:35.794 --> 21:37.087
Ready the hwacha.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.507
What's that?

21:42.592 --> 21:44.386
That's how we're going to end this.

22:27.846 --> 22:31.266
- What is that smell?
- Anything too rotten to eat or use.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.894
It's why there's nobody out here.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.939
Do you remember where you're going?

22:38.357 --> 22:41.568
Top floor, second room,
southwest corner of the building.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.862
Just remember to wait for my signal.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.946
Got it.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.827
We do this, and we get the food
and we go home.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.642
- The hinges are coming apart.
- And the frame.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.733
- What are you doing?
- I'm buying us time.

23:21.817 --> 23:22.818
What?

23:23.777 --> 23:24.778
What can I do?

23:24.778 --> 23:26.571
Close the door behind me.
Keep it closed.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.241
All right, on my count. One.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.494
Two.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.705
Three.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.305
Let's stay away from the windows.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.124
- Ready?
- Ready. Go.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.925
- You built this?
- Yep.

25:51.925 --> 25:55.178
Ancheta was a combat engineer.
Now he's our DaVinci, right?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.306
This hwacha will make short work
of those rotters.

25:59.558 --> 26:03.144
- We can mop up everything else.
- Let me know when you're ready.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.990
Sorry about Wells.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.327
I shouldn't have let him out there
by himself.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.581
- It wasn't on you.
- It was my responsibility.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.749
I should have had his back
like he's always had mine.

26:25.375 --> 26:29.254
My people, we protect each other.
At least, we used to.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.883
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- What?

26:34.801 --> 26:37.470
Pope says, "God chose us."

26:38.513 --> 26:41.433
- You believe all that?
- Why?

26:43.602 --> 26:46.980
- Just asking.
- Look, I know how it sounds.

26:47.647 --> 26:50.442
But when we had nothing.
He gave us something to hold onto.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.445
We're all alive
'cause we believed in him.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.905
What about now?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.494
Doesn't matter
whether I believe or not.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.206
Well, it matters to me.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.050
You ever think
about what it'd be like

27:15.634 --> 27:17.969
if we'd never left that cabin?

27:18.803 --> 27:19.804
Yeah.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.557
Yeah, I do.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.311
It's hard to watch someone
you care about change.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.690
And when they're hurting
other people you care about too.

27:33.568 --> 27:34.569
Yeah, it is.

27:37.697 --> 27:38.698
Daryl...

27:39.741 --> 27:44.079
<i>- What's the status of the hwacha?</i>
- We're ready and standing by.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.670
<i>Okay, Leah, it's time to do this.</i>

27:52.253 --> 27:53.421
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

27:57.884 --> 28:00.845
Wait. I have to tell you something.

28:01.721 --> 28:02.806
What?

28:03.556 --> 28:05.725
There's people down there
walking with the dead.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.146
My people.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.360
They're here for the food
that Pope took from them.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.446
They'll starve without it
and they're good people.

28:20.323 --> 28:24.202
They got families. They don't know
what's about to happen to them.

28:24.327 --> 28:26.287
Please, you can't let them
die like this.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.419
You lied to me.

28:33.002 --> 28:36.798
To protect my family.
I'm sure you can understand that.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.468
Carver told me not to trust you.

28:43.096 --> 28:46.599
But I wanted to. So badly.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.435
I didn't think
I could trust you either

28:48.435 --> 28:49.519
when I saw who you were with.

28:49.644 --> 28:52.647
What do you think Pope is gonna do
when he finds out you're with her?

28:52.772 --> 28:54.065
He doesn't have to know.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.237
You could come with me.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.701
Just please, let me stop him.
Please, you gotta help me.

29:04.868 --> 29:09.247
It is time for our enemy
to face their reckoning.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.091
Oh, my.
What were you two talking about?

29:25.764 --> 29:26.765
Family.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.602
Ain't nothing more important.

29:32.979 --> 29:37.233
The only real thing that
we got left in this world.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.029
Would you agree, Dixon?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.408
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

29:53.249 --> 29:58.630
When this is done, I want you
to find that woman for me.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.553
Bring her to me, Dixon.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.682
Good man.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.211
<i>Deaver, what's the status
on the chain on that gate?</i>

31:21.212 --> 31:22.380
Heading to the garage now.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.521
Hey! Stop!

31:38.605 --> 31:40.815
Come here. No! No!

32:00.209 --> 32:01.210
No!

32:14.891 --> 32:16.851
Carver, what the hell
is going on down there?

32:17.810 --> 32:19.395
It's the enemy,
they're inside the wall.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.001
Aim into the courtyard and fire.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.129
- Sir?
- Uh-huh. You heard me.

32:47.674 --> 32:48.716
Now!

32:49.634 --> 32:51.844
- Our people are out there.
- I am aware of that.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.262
So let's call them back in.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.849
Alert the enemy? No.
God will protect them.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.351
And what if he doesn't?

33:01.396 --> 33:05.358
- Then it was their time to die.
- Pope, we can win this another way.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.610
We will win this our way.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.320
- You can't kill our...
- I can.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.657
I can.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.911
The Lord speaks through me.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.666
You don't question the Lord,
you don't question me!

33:25.795 --> 33:26.796
Light it up.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.778
...on fire!

34:35.198 --> 34:36.407
Come on!

35:04.727 --> 35:07.522
Leah, come on, before they find us.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.040
Pope is dead.

35:31.212 --> 35:34.924
Dixon murdered him.
He's with the enemy.

35:39.262 --> 35:42.682
<i>Shaw, repeat. Pope is dead?</i>

35:44.725 --> 35:47.895
<i>Leah, do you copy?
We're on our way.</i>

35:51.858 --> 35:53.234
Why would you do that?

35:56.821 --> 36:00.616
He forgot about what mattered.
Not war.

36:01.784 --> 36:02.827
People.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.247
My people.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.877
You'd do anything to protect your family.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.006
So would I.

36:16.716 --> 36:17.842
<i>Leah.</i>

36:46.078 --> 36:47.914
I should have killed him
when I had the chance.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.875
- Go get the gate closed.
- Then what?

36:51.292 --> 36:53.836
Then we're gonna kill
everything inside these walls.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.773
This isn't gonna hold them for long.
There's too many of them.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.816
Do I need to radio Aaron and Carol?

37:15.900 --> 37:18.194
No. They need to put out
that fire and close those breaches.

37:21.739 --> 37:24.617
If we get everyone upstairs, we can
hold them off to the first floor?

37:25.076 --> 37:28.162
Yeah. Everyone, upstairs, now. Go.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.124
Go with Hershel, RJ.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.511
No, no, no, don't worry about me.
You go, get up those steps.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.179
I will, with you.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.101
- I'll get him. Okay?
- Yeah.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.815
I'll take him from here, Judith.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.487
Gracie?

38:04.573 --> 38:05.950
Gracie?

38:07.243 --> 38:08.244
Judith!

38:08.619 --> 38:09.870
Gracie?

38:10.788 --> 38:11.998
I'm down here.

38:15.793 --> 38:16.794
Judith.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.301
- I got this. Okay? You go get Coco.
- What?

38:23.843 --> 38:25.303
Go! Go!

38:37.398 --> 38:38.441
What are you doing?

38:38.983 --> 38:42.695
I wanted something to fight with,
a weapon like you and Rosita have.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.665
Here. We need to go.

39:07.636 --> 39:08.846
Go, go, go.

39:16.771 --> 39:17.772
Come on.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.138
<i>Fall back.</i>

39:52.598 --> 39:55.559
Let's go. Fall back. Fall back.

39:58.979 --> 40:01.482
You've got to be shitting me.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.484
They're retreating.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.073
But why?
