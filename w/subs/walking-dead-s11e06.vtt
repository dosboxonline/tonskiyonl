WEBVTT

00:12.846 --> 00:14.347
No, no, no, no.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.360
Look! Look!

00:28.028 --> 00:32.282
Sorry. Sorry, I'm just...
No. It might be a house.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.950
We could hide.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.830
No.

00:50.842 --> 00:51.885
Go!

02:57.802 --> 03:00.054
We'll make better time
if I ride out of my own.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.099
It's less risky and we're gonna cover
more ground with a larger group.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.726
The council is working on a plan
right now.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.936
Connie doesn't have time to wait
on a committee.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.564
Why don't we split the difference
between fast and safe?

03:09.564 --> 03:12.150
Teams of two. We could divide
the map up into smaller grids.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.902
It can reduce the risk.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.237
Hey, any of you seen Kelly?

05:18.192 --> 05:19.193
Okay.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.779
Uh...

05:23.239 --> 05:25.700
I checked the whole house.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.619
We're okay.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.371
Nobody's here.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.417
You need...

05:46.095 --> 05:49.474
"You need some rest."

05:53.061 --> 05:55.438
You haven't slept in days.

05:58.066 --> 06:02.236
"I can keep watch."

06:09.327 --> 06:15.208
"We will find your home."

06:18.002 --> 06:20.588
You sleep.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.476
Listen.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.687
Rest.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.689
Huh?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.116
All right.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.002
Tell us where they are!

07:52.889 --> 07:56.309
My dance card is wide open, man.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.561
We got all day.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.650
This bother you?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.569
I've done worse.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.243
Why don't you take a turn, then?

08:18.664 --> 08:21.792
- Speed things up for me.
- All right.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.420
- I'm up.
- Like hell you are!

08:51.948 --> 08:55.201
Are we just gonna stand here
staring at each other dreamily

08:55.201 --> 08:57.328
or are we gonna get to it?

09:07.755 --> 09:11.050
Hey, you kill him, the two of us
are gonna have a problem!

09:14.095 --> 09:17.807
I don't need a babysitter.
I know what I'm doing.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.858
Just give 'em a location
where your friends are hiding.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.945
You do that, this all goes away.

09:32.321 --> 09:35.741
That's, uh... That's a good offer.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.245
Or... And hear me out.

09:40.454 --> 09:43.124
You all could go eat shit instead.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.379
Just a thought.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.466
I've already gone through these steps.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.845
Maybe we start taking pieces.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.891
You do what you gotta do.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.145
Give him a knife.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.954
I don't think you understand,
I'm the best shot you got.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.083
- Why? We friends now?
- No.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.670
Not 'cause we're friends.
Because I'm the one holding the knife.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.551
Yeah. And your buddy's
the one holding the gun.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.934
Shut up! Shut up and listen to me.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.440
I know you're close to her.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.567
The leader.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.946
Close enough to know
where they're hiding.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.346
No one needs to die in here.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.977
So just say the location,
so we can all walk away happy.

11:32.942 --> 11:33.943
Go to hell, asshole!

11:38.197 --> 11:40.658
Location! Or I take another!

11:40.658 --> 11:43.619
- No, I can't.
- Location!

11:43.703 --> 11:45.996
- No! Please stop.
- Location!

11:49.583 --> 11:51.085
Yellow house!

11:51.877 --> 11:54.255
Uh... Town off the 283.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.217
Antenna. Antenna. Antenna. Antenna.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.394
Is that good enough?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.439
I can scout it out.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.401
Take a squad. Three of you.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.155
- See if our friend speaks truth.
- You want us to take him?

14:47.094 --> 14:49.096
Wait. What happened?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.685
Slow down. I don't understand.

15:13.787 --> 15:14.788
What?

16:16.016 --> 16:18.018
Looks quiet. No movement.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.062
Two entrances. Breach both?

16:20.062 --> 16:22.690
By twos. You take Powell.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.819
Washington, Fish.
Go around the back of the yellow house.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.282
What about dickhead?

16:32.366 --> 16:33.826
I'm supposed to believe
he's got my back.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.577
No, that's my job.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.788
Always.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.290
Go.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.261
Clear!

17:38.015 --> 17:39.266
Clear!

17:44.813 --> 17:46.190
Clear!

17:51.445 --> 17:52.446
Clear!

17:55.532 --> 17:57.284
It's all clear, Carv.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.661
That son of a bitch jerked us around.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.664
We should stay. Look around for a bit.
So we don't miss nothing.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.042
No. We'll search
the rest of the town first.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.169
Quick and quiet,
in case they're still nearby.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.879
You three,
take the north end and work back.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.756
- We'll meet you in the middle.
- Copy.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.770
Whoa.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.387
Where are you?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.649
My grandfather's house
used to have one of these.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.694
I'd secretly shove stuff in there.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.742
I'm sorry, I don't see anything.

20:06.079 --> 20:09.791
I'm sure you saw something, but...

20:11.293 --> 20:13.587
But you haven't slept.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.341
So, maybe it's...

20:18.634 --> 20:20.302
Yeah, it's...

20:25.182 --> 20:27.726
Okay, okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.561
You and me,

20:29.645 --> 20:32.439
let's give the house
another sweep. Okay?

20:44.660 --> 20:46.078
Connie!

22:18.754 --> 22:19.755
Clear!

22:22.424 --> 22:23.425
Over here!

22:27.429 --> 22:28.722
They're still wet.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.183
I guess he was telling the truth, then?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.976
We should clear the other rooms.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.148
Clear!

22:38.440 --> 22:39.441
Clear!

22:41.151 --> 22:42.444
Clear!

22:43.403 --> 22:44.488
REAPER 2: Clear!

22:59.461 --> 23:00.462
Nothing.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.547
Maybe they went out the back.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.049
I can track them.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.259
Are you in a hurry to leave?

23:07.427 --> 23:08.428
What?

23:08.512 --> 23:10.847
The other building,
you wanted to stick around

23:10.931 --> 23:12.682
and make sure we didn't miss anything.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.184
Now, you want to run right off.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.268
Which is it?

23:16.520 --> 23:17.896
Look, man, I'm just trying to help.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.940
Yet you keep chirping.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.025
Fine. You lose 'em, it's on you,
it ain't on me.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.110
Stop.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.362
Wash, we need a perimeter check.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.988
Possible runners. Half a klick.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.657
<i>Copy that, Shaw.</i>

23:28.657 --> 23:32.369
Look, I don't have time
for this talk bullshit.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.287
- Listen...
- I know!

23:34.371 --> 23:36.790
I understand, but I don't need it.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.043
Go, sift upstairs.
Make sure we didn't miss anything.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.181
- Don't.
- Don't what?

23:58.311 --> 24:00.689
You're either with us, or you're not.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.277
What do you want me to do?

24:10.323 --> 24:13.577
For one thing, stop pissing off Carver.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.121
Usually doesn't end well.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.100
Please. please! Just a...

24:37.976 --> 24:40.770
Just a little bit more!

24:41.938 --> 24:44.065
Whoa! Kelly!

24:44.149 --> 24:45.150
Awesome.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.819
You need help?

24:54.826 --> 24:56.578
What the hell were you thinking?

24:56.995 --> 24:59.789
You should have told us
that you're heading out.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.291
Come here.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.628
I'm fine.

25:08.131 --> 25:09.132
But Connie's not.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.720
I found her camp.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.473
She's with some guy who knew Michonne.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.977
They left in hurry.
Something's not right.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.566
She thought they were being followed.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.152
She's out there.

25:29.986 --> 25:33.240
She is scared. She needs me.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.245
If something happened to her...

25:38.245 --> 25:40.163
No, we're going to find her first.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.501
Yeah. Come on, let's get moving.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.047
Hungry!

31:15.832 --> 31:16.833
Oh, God.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.755
Come on. I got you.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.465
Come on.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.884
Oh, God.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.311
They ran. They ain't coming back here.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.521
- What?
- I mean, think about it.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.606
You hit them hard.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.483
Even if they get more people, they won't
come back here. It's a bad move.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.737
You've got, what,
20 people in your town?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.238
You got weapons. You got walls.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.825
You'd see 'em coming from a mile away.
Trust me, they ran.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.162
- Is there a point to any of this?
- Let's go.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.290
There's nothing here.
It's time we move on.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.251
No. We're missing something.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.961
Fine. Let's waste another hour.
That's smart.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.254
- Daryl...
- It's not my fault

32:03.338 --> 32:04.881
he's too stupid to pay attention.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.716
- Chirp. Chirp. Chirp.
- Enough.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.469
Screw that. This dirtbag wants to play.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.095
I'll teach him the rules.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.847
I'm right here, man. Make a move.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.475
This is not time
and it's not your call to make.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.018
Jesus, Shaw.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.104
We both know who he really is deep down.

32:20.563 --> 32:21.648
What?

32:22.482 --> 32:24.817
I was there. Remember?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.111
After?

32:27.195 --> 32:29.656
What, you think
this is gonna end any different?

32:30.073 --> 32:33.284
So, this is what?
You looking out for me?

32:34.035 --> 32:37.121
- Always.
- Uh-huh. Got ya.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.209
And what about the fire?

32:42.293 --> 32:45.004
When Pope locked me in the cabin
and lit it up?

32:47.131 --> 32:48.591
You must have known.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.178
Was that you looking out for me, too?

32:52.178 --> 32:54.430
Shaw, wake up.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.849
Everything is a test now.

32:57.392 --> 33:01.270
If you think this guy is ever gonna
give a shit about any of us,

33:01.354 --> 33:02.605
you're gonna fail.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.941
No, he's right.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.903
I don't give a shit about any of you.
Except you.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.114
I'm here for you.

33:12.407 --> 33:16.202
It's no secret I made mistakes.
But I'm here right now.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.623
Maybe I'd be better at this time,
if you'll let me.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.003
And Pope scares the shit out of me.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.548
I don't wanna be face first
in the fire under his boot.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.926
But if you say trust him,
I'll trust him.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.391
We've wasted enough time here already.

33:38.391 --> 33:42.437
- Oh, you're not seriously...
- It's time to move on.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.607
Sure. Your call.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.863
Hold on.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.712
Told ya.

34:34.781 --> 34:35.782
Which way?

34:39.327 --> 34:41.913
We could split up, check both trails,
double back.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.332
Storm's coming.
We should stick together.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.668
It's up to you.
Which way do you think she went?

34:57.887 --> 34:59.055
That way.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.689
They led us here.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.777
I've never seen people this far gone.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.990
To herd us like prey.

35:23.287 --> 35:26.749
But we're not. I'm getting you out.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.128
We'll make a run for it.

35:36.926 --> 35:37.927
Take this.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.143
No matter what happens,

35:46.227 --> 35:49.063
you have to keep going.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.858
With or without me.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.818
Don't stop, just...

35:58.030 --> 35:59.949
No, no, no, please.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.660
Just take it.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.057
I don't know how to explain.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.601
Um...

36:27.727 --> 36:29.979
But I don't have a choice.

36:35.193 --> 36:39.071
I lost myself for a long time.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.616
Off the map.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.037
And I, um...

36:48.748 --> 36:52.710
I've made choices that I can't unchoose.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.173
But she gave me another chance. Michonne.

36:57.798 --> 37:00.009
She pointed me back to the road,

37:00.009 --> 37:04.472
and somehow, that road led right to you.

37:06.682 --> 37:10.645
So, I have to pass on that chance
or it all means nothing.

37:11.437 --> 37:13.231
And if you can...

37:17.109 --> 37:18.194
If you

37:20.780 --> 37:22.907
can find your family...

37:26.911 --> 37:28.996
No, listen, listen.

37:29.455 --> 37:32.625
I need you to promise me

37:33.125 --> 37:36.587
that you'll keep going,
no matter what happens.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.141
Together?

37:57.942 --> 37:59.110
Together.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.283
Time's up.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.356
Go, go, go, go, go!

38:47.616 --> 38:48.617
Go!

39:02.340 --> 39:05.092
Go! Get out.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.001
Go.

42:08.567 --> 42:09.818
They were there.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.821
Caught signs, but they slipped away.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.325
Sorry.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.870
Ooh.

42:21.622 --> 42:24.083
I thought you'd be disappointed.

42:24.083 --> 42:26.293
Well, this night was a success.

42:26.627 --> 42:27.670
How so?

42:28.295 --> 42:32.258
After you left, I continued
the discussion with our guest.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.010
He wasn't too talkative.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.931
But I got everything I needed
out of him.
