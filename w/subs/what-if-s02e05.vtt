(SCREECHES)

00:19.583 --> 00:20.583
Thanks, Cap.

00:20.666 --> 00:21.916
What are new friends for?

00:26.416 --> 00:28.875
-Nice.
-Little trick I picked up in Berlin.

00:28.958 --> 00:30.166
Uh-huh. Watch this.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.250
(GRUNTS)

00:34.166 --> 00:35.791
Where did that move come from?

00:35.875 --> 00:38.833
Oh, that? You know, Moscow.
I had a strange childhood.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.500
(GRUNTING)

00:51.500 --> 00:53.250
So, Cap, what's the plan?

00:53.333 --> 00:55.708
Hawkeye, Wasp, I want eyes in the sky.

00:55.791 --> 00:58.375
Iron Man, Thor,
keep the fighting down here.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.916
Widow, let's go for a ride.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.041
I like it.

01:03.416 --> 01:04.458

01:07.791 --> 01:08.833

01:13.583 --> 01:14.791

-(GASPS)

01:14.916 --> 01:16.416
-LOKI: Hmm.
-Nice hat.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.250
PEGGY: You go high, I go low?

01:18.333 --> 01:20.916
Or we could just
punch him a whole lot.

01:21.041 --> 01:24.125
Hmm. He does have a very punchable face.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.375
THE WATCHER: Time.

01:33.833 --> 01:34.875
Space.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.500
Reality.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.291
It's more than a linear path.

01:47.041 --> 01:51.625
It's a prism of endless possibility,

01:53.916 --> 01:57.416
where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,

02:00.250 --> 02:03.250
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.291
I am the Watcher.

02:10.708 --> 02:13.583
I am your guide
through these vast new realities.

02:15.458 --> 02:19.291
Follow me and ponder the question...

02:22.458 --> 02:23.625
"What if?"

02:29.208 --> 02:30.958
I don't do sequels.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.458
Normally.

02:32.541 --> 02:34.750
What's the point of revisiting the story

02:34.833 --> 02:37.791
when there are infinite stories
to be told?

02:38.250 --> 02:44.125
But then, not every universe
is home to a Captain Peggy Carter,

02:44.208 --> 02:48.125
the super-soldier,
the hero of World War II,

02:48.208 --> 02:51.041
a woman quite literally ahead of her time.

02:51.458 --> 02:55.583
But there is only one Peggy Carter
that I would call my friend.

02:55.666 --> 02:57.625
She and the (CHUCKLES)

02:57.708 --> 03:01.916
Guardians of the Multiverse
saved all of existence.

03:02.666 --> 03:07.833
I returned the heroes to their own worlds,
the exact moments they left.

03:08.416 --> 03:11.875
Peggy, though,
she thought her story was over,

03:12.958 --> 03:15.083
but it was only just beginning.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.041
Hey, lovely. Need a lift?

03:20.416 --> 03:22.583
You know,
you could join me one of these mornings.

03:22.666 --> 03:24.958
Running in circles
has never been my style.

03:25.041 --> 03:27.041
Besides, Fury has a mission for us.

03:27.125 --> 03:28.541
Think of it as extra cardio.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.750
(SIGHS) Oh, man.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.333
You need more hobbies.

03:32.666 --> 03:33.958
(ENGINE REVS)

03:35.916 --> 03:38.333
ROMANOFF: I found
what the pirates were after.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.041
Peggy, you might wanna brace yourself.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.416
PEGGY: I can promise you, Nat,

03:43.500 --> 03:46.250
this won't be the strangest thing
that I've dealt with today.

03:46.916 --> 03:48.333
ROMANOFF: Famous last words.

03:56.416 --> 03:57.750
PEGGY: The HYDRA Stomper?

03:58.583 --> 03:59.625
ROMANOFF: Yeah.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.958
And there's someone inside.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.250
Steve?

04:04.416 --> 04:05.833
(POWERING UP)

04:10.250 --> 04:11.291
Whoa, Peg.

04:11.916 --> 04:12.916
(BOTH GRUNTING)

04:14.250 --> 04:16.291
Not Steve. More like RoboCop.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.416
PEGGY: Robo-what?

04:17.500 --> 04:20.166
ROMANOFF: You haven't seen that?
We'll rent it. Solid movie.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.250
Oh, Steve...

05:22.916 --> 05:24.125
Peg, we gotta go.

05:36.541 --> 05:38.791
PEGGY: You told me Steve died.
FURY: He did.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.958
-On a mission in Argentina.
-FURY: He did.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.208
-In 1953!
-He did.

05:43.583 --> 05:46.416
After the war, Rogers and Barnes
formed their own two-man army

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
and destroyed every HYDRA base on Earth.

05:48.583 --> 05:51.833
Until the last mission
claimed Steve's life.

05:51.916 --> 05:55.583
-Well, I have bruises that say otherwise.
-(SIGHS) There's been rumors

05:55.750 --> 05:58.416
about the HYDRA Stomper's survival
since the 1960s.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.208
The 1960s?

06:00.291 --> 06:01.875
Why wasn't I debriefed on this?

06:01.958 --> 06:04.208
Because we didn't debrief you
on Bigfoot either.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.958
-Wait. What?
-FURY: Look, Carter,

06:06.041 --> 06:09.166
if the stories are true,
then the HYDRA Stomper is responsible

06:09.250 --> 06:11.458
for some of the world's
worst acts of terror,

06:11.541 --> 06:14.291
which cost the lives
of dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,

06:14.375 --> 06:16.041
including friends of mine.

06:16.791 --> 06:19.125
Fury, Steve would never do that.

06:19.208 --> 06:21.333
He would if the Red Room was in control.

06:21.625 --> 06:22.625
What are you saying?

06:22.708 --> 06:27.291
It was rumored that her old home
found and housed the HYDRA Stomper.

06:27.375 --> 06:30.208
You knew about this,
and you didn't tell me?

06:30.291 --> 06:33.000
Didn't see the point
in breaking your heart twice.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.500
The HYDRA Stomper
was on that boat for a reason.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.750
Tech Ops decoded the ship's transmissions.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.750
We have a lead on its next mission.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.208
Good. I'll lead a strike team.

06:41.291 --> 06:43.375
Have a full medical crew
on standby for Rogers.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.333
We don't know how long
he's been in that suit.

06:45.416 --> 06:47.666
It might be better for you
to sit this fight out.

06:47.750 --> 06:51.958
I'm Peggy Carter,
and we're talking about Steve Rogers.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.458
Even if only one tenth
of those rumors are true,

06:54.541 --> 06:58.416
it still makes the Stomper
the world's most dangerous killer.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500
I have a shield.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.583
A shield ain't gonna stop him.

07:01.666 --> 07:06.750
Peg, the Steve Rogers
that you loved died in 1953.

07:06.833 --> 07:09.000
That thing, it's not human.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.666
What's the HYDRA Stomper's mission?

07:12.041 --> 07:13.791
SINGH: Secretary of State Barnes...

07:14.666 --> 07:16.458
Bucky, if you'll permit me.

07:16.541 --> 07:20.500
Surely you understand that the Sokovian
aid package is generous considering...

07:20.583 --> 07:23.666
Considering it doesn't cover
hospitals, schools or new roads?

07:23.750 --> 07:26.750
Fix it. I won't have a country
torn apart by civil war

07:26.833 --> 07:28.500
because we didn't do the right thing.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.583
Right away, sir.

07:29.708 --> 07:32.500
Mr. Secretary, we need
to move you to a secure location.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.583
What's going on?

07:33.666 --> 07:36.000
Sir, we believe there might be
an attempt on your life.

07:36.541 --> 07:38.750
Okay, I may be an old man, boys,

07:38.833 --> 07:41.416
but I've punched Nazis
and shared beers with aliens.

07:41.583 --> 07:42.875
I can handle myself.

Natasha, I need you out there.

08:10.416 --> 08:12.250
You have the green light to shoot it down.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.458
Lethal force, sir?

08:13.541 --> 08:18.625
That thing is an international terrorist
attempting to assassinate a US official.

I'm trusting you to do the right thing.

Bucky, it's Steve.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.541
-Steve?
-Steve's in the suit.

08:31.958 --> 08:34.666
-Alive.
-Well, that's a different kettle of cod.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.875
What's powering it?
It's not the Tesseract.

08:36.958 --> 08:39.166
Hmm. Something Howard
cooked up after the war.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.208
Probably a mix of plutonium and pomade.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.208
Well, good. That means I can break it.

Please get down, sir!

to do the same for me.

Not only is this thing
preserving his good looks,

12:29.333 --> 12:31.250
it's the only thing keeping him alive.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.333
You can't remove it?

(CLEARS THROAT)
According to these readouts,

12:54.250 --> 12:57.916
with each activation,
the odds of Steve's survival plummets.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.458
No wonder the Red Room
deployed him sparingly.

13:00.541 --> 13:03.541
No fun playing Russian roulette
with biotech, huh?

-Speaking of tech, what if we...
-No.

-Well, if not Stark, then Banner?
-No.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.333
Unplugging it and plugging it back in
is not gonna work.

13:16.416 --> 13:17.416
-We need help.
-No.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.375
We don't have time for Banner
and Stark to play mad scientist.

13:20.458 --> 13:23.708
After today, every government
on the planet is hunting Steve.

13:23.791 --> 13:24.875
Best-case scenario,

13:24.958 --> 13:27.708
he winds up stuck in some prison,
frozen in carbonite.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.666
"Frozen in carbonite"?

13:30.041 --> 13:32.125
So that's how
you spend your Saturday nights.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.250
-We'll go to the Red Room.
-What?

13:34.333 --> 13:36.458
I've never been a woman to quit a fight.

13:36.541 --> 13:37.875
The Red Room did this.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.916
If there's a cure, it'll be there.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.375
You know, I always wondered

13:41.458 --> 13:44.375
how you got all those G.I. boys
to follow a woman into war.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.375
I spent five days in a Hungarian sewer

13:51.458 --> 13:54.083
tracking down and killing
the head of the Red Room.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.541
Are you certain you killed him?

13:55.625 --> 13:58.791
I mean, I stabbed him
in the carotid artery with a corkscrew.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.458
So, yeah, I think I did.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.333
-You should write a memoir.
-Or, like, a how-to manual.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.291
But, at the end of the day,
it meant nothing.

14:07.375 --> 14:10.833
The Red Room survived
because its location is secret.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.166
No one can find it. Not even S.H.I.E.L.D.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.791
-Sorry.
-ROGERS: I can take you.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.750
-Steve.
-Peggy, that's not Steve.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.500
It's been a while, Peggy.
I owe you that date.

14:24.583 --> 14:25.583
Steve.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.750
ROGERS: Not too far from the Red Room.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.708
PEGGY: Where are we?
ROGERS: A Sokovian military base.

14:49.791 --> 14:52.750
Until the '90s,
it was a training camp for KGB spies.

14:52.833 --> 14:55.500
When the Kremlin abandoned it,
the Red Room moved in.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.041
The KGB built it

14:57.125 --> 15:00.541
to look like an American town
straight out of a John Mellencamp song.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.875
-He's a rock 'n' roll musician.
-Oh, I know.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.416
Barton introduced me to dad rock.

ANIMATRONIC WOMAN: Baseball and apple pie.

15:22.333 --> 15:25.458
ANIMATRONIC MAN: You smell that air?
That's the smell of freedom.

15:27.583 --> 15:31.083
WOMAN: Well, hi there, neighbor.
(CHUCKLES) I love America.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.500
I feel like I'm in a horror movie.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.458
And we once fought a giant space squid.

15:35.708 --> 15:36.958
I signaled the Red Room.

15:37.041 --> 15:39.916
Told them I had mechanical issues
and to send a transport.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.125
We have a little time.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.041
(INHALES) That's a first.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.083
Okay.

15:50.166 --> 15:54.125
Uh, I'm gonna go find
a lemonade stand or something.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.125
ROGERS: I don't remember much.

15:57.208 --> 15:59.666
When I was awake, the suit was in control.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.916
It was like watching the world
through fogged glass.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.625
PEGGY: I stepped through a door.

16:04.708 --> 16:08.833
In one breath,
the war was over and the future was here.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.208
So, what do you think of the future?

16:11.291 --> 16:12.791
In a word, faster.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.875
Cars. Computers. Even the news moves fast.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.875
And, uh, the dancing?

16:19.083 --> 16:20.125
Still slow.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.500
ANIMATRONIC MOM: It's a baby!

16:24.500 --> 16:26.625
You could've had that, after the war.

16:26.708 --> 16:30.875
A wife, kids, the whole
white picket fence life. Barnes did.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.291
Hmm.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.625
-Good for him.
-Steve...

16:34.708 --> 16:37.250
I didn't see much point,
unless it was with you.

16:37.541 --> 16:39.333
I spent years going after HYDRA.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.416
As long as I was on a mission,
I could pretend you weren't gone.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.708
-It's crazy.
-No, not crazy.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.500
Very human, actually.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.541
But you're here now.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.541

Oh. He's happier this way.

No regret. No loss.

Only me and his mission.

Oh, Natasha, so you believe
you "rebooted" him?

19:19.583 --> 19:20.708
That is strange.

19:20.791 --> 19:24.708
You never struck me as a child
foolish enough to buy into fantasy.

You are Captain Margaret Carter,

kill you or dissect you.

Yes. Good plan.
