Where did you get this?

20:28.228 --> 20:30.981
Okay, it was in the crawl space
this whole time because I was mad.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.484
I was so mad that I couldn't return it,
so I just hid it

20:34.568 --> 20:36.111
and I told you I returned it.

20:36.778 --> 20:37.821
So, there you go.

20:38.780 --> 20:39.823
You're awesome.

20:41.950 --> 20:42.993
I'm sorry.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.164
I'm really sorry
I made a big deal out of it.

If I'd known... (SIGHS)

a stupid credit card bill.

No. No, no, no, no. See, I...

21:02.221 --> 21:04.389
I don't deserve anything from you.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.769
And you shouldn't be apologizing to me.

21:08.852 --> 21:11.563
It should be me apologizing to you.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.067

21:16.944 --> 21:19.071
the pain that I put you through.

21:22.241 --> 21:25.536

I lay awake at night

21:27.204 --> 21:32.668
just wondering how I got so lucky
that you have stuck with me.

21:36.588 --> 21:37.631
Come here.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.429
Listen to me.

21:45.639 --> 21:49.268
I stuck with you
'cause I could always see

21:50.269 --> 21:52.521

21:53.856 --> 21:55.023

22:14.001 --> 22:17.171

22:19.548 --> 22:20.549
No.

-You better.

22:58.504 --> 23:01.298
No. No, no, no, no!

23:21.235 --> 23:23.529
You remember that guy and his family
that came through here last year,

23:23.612 --> 23:25.239
their kid had leukemia,

23:25.614 --> 23:27.908
and they were looking
for this group of doctors

23:27.991 --> 23:29.660
who travel around in a mobile clinic.

23:30.202 --> 23:32.246
I remember I sat down with him,
he showed me his map.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.748
These doctors, they take
the same route every time.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.458
They make the same stops.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.918
I think that I know where they are.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.379
And if I leave right now,
I can catch them before they move on.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.756
They could be dead by now
If they even existed to begin with.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.132
And then, what do you do
when you find them?

23:44.216 --> 23:46.134
You have nothing to barter with,
so just stop.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.220

-Stop, Negan!

39:06.555 --> 39:08.849
You know, it's been a long day.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.852
I... I did not get
much sleep last night,

39:11.935 --> 39:15.355
so this is gonna be the last time I ask.

39:15.898 --> 39:18.942
Tell me where you keep the good stuff,

39:19.318 --> 39:21.236
or I'm going to bring out the girl.

39:24.281 --> 39:27.201
She's a little young for you,
don't you think?

You take this and go find your daughter

41:21.940 --> 41:23.025
Okay.

41:37.164 --> 41:39.833
Well, look at us.

41:40.834 --> 41:42.252
Here we are again.

41:43.670 --> 41:47.299
You know, last time we did this,
you said that I talk too much.

41:48.258 --> 41:52.221
The bad news is, I got some stuff
to get off my chest this time as well.

41:53.096 --> 41:54.431
But see, this time...

41:56.016 --> 41:58.769
this time, you best hope
I never stopped talking.

41:59.353 --> 42:00.938
Because when I do,

42:02.147 --> 42:05.192
when I do, something very terrible
is going to happen to you.

42:07.027 --> 42:09.404
You know, I never killed
a man before tonight.

42:10.239 --> 42:11.323
It's the truth.

42:12.241 --> 42:13.659
I came close once.

42:14.952 --> 42:19.706
See, there was this, this bar
my wife and I used to go to.

42:19.790 --> 42:21.917
It was our favorite bar.
It was our favorite bar

42:22.000 --> 42:23.627
because it had our favorite jukebox,

42:23.710 --> 42:27.840
favorite jukebox because,
well, it had our favorite song.

42:28.549 --> 42:32.219
<i>"You Are So Beautiful"</i>
by the one and only Joe Cocker.

42:33.595 --> 42:35.848
Probably the greatest
love ballad ever written,

42:35.931 --> 42:37.808
I'm sure you agree.

42:38.684 --> 42:41.520
Well, see, there was...
there was this guy.

42:43.814 --> 42:45.482
This guy, he had, uh...

42:46.233 --> 42:49.611
He had one of those voices
you can't unhear.

42:49.987 --> 42:52.865
And it was like
my brain had been hijacked

42:52.948 --> 42:54.992
and I can't... I can't think anymore.

42:55.367 --> 42:58.245
Anyway, he is talking and laughing

42:58.328 --> 43:01.123
while the song is playing,
being completely obnoxious.

43:01.206 --> 43:03.458
So my beautiful wife, Lucille,

43:03.709 --> 43:07.337
she gets up, goes over to where he is,

43:07.504 --> 43:12.217
and politely asked him if he could
keep it down so she could hear her song.

43:12.301 --> 43:16.430
Well, let's just say he chose poorly.

43:17.014 --> 43:20.100
So now, I got to get up and I go over

43:20.184 --> 43:22.811
and I tell him that he owes me 50 cents,

43:24.021 --> 43:25.981
so I can play the song again,

43:26.064 --> 43:30.819
he can shut the hell up
and my wife can enjoy her song.

43:33.030 --> 43:34.156
Now, here's the important part.

43:34.239 --> 43:36.825
I really want you
to pay attention to this.

43:37.659 --> 43:40.662
You know, when people get so angry,
they say they see red.

43:41.538 --> 43:44.291
That shit is actually true.

43:44.875 --> 43:47.961
When this asshole comes at me,
all I see is red.

43:48.045 --> 43:50.964
It's like I am looking
at the world through blood.

43:51.548 --> 43:52.925
So, I wail on him.

43:54.301 --> 43:57.638
I wail on this son of a bitch
until he's not moving.

43:57.804 --> 44:00.057
And then, I reached down,
I grabbed his wallet

44:00.432 --> 44:02.059
and I take out one dollar

44:03.268 --> 44:07.439
and I play our song again... twice.

44:08.941 --> 44:14.404
Turns out this prick has kids that go
to the school that I teach gym at.

44:16.448 --> 44:20.786
Needless to say,
the school is un-thrilled.

44:21.245 --> 44:22.496
I get fired.

44:22.579 --> 44:23.664
This guy sues me.

44:23.747 --> 44:27.876
I don't have a job, so now
my wife has to pay his medical bills.

44:28.335 --> 44:33.715
So, the point of this is, there were
consequences to me seeing red.

44:33.799 --> 44:36.218
Seeing red was a bad thing then.

44:36.301 --> 44:40.222
I was a bad man... then.

44:40.722 --> 44:42.099
But, see, now,

44:42.683 --> 44:45.602
nobody's suing anybody,
nobody is getting fired,

44:45.686 --> 44:47.229
hell, nobody's keeping score.

44:48.105 --> 44:53.652
Now, when I see red, it's just
a question of what I am capable of.

44:54.570 --> 44:57.406
And well, man,
I hate to break it to you.

44:58.407 --> 45:04.037
See, I am starting to think
that I am capable of damn near anything.

45:08.417 --> 45:09.585
So, this...

45:12.171 --> 45:14.673
this is for not killing me.

I couldn't face the pain of losing you,
so I ran away.

46:04.264 --> 46:06.058
And then, I made myself
not feel anything

46:06.141 --> 46:07.976
because I didn't want to feel the shame.

46:08.060 --> 46:12.940
The problem is, that... shame is
the one thing that I still felt.

46:16.109 --> 46:18.820
I'm sorry that you went out like that.

46:20.322 --> 46:21.782
I should've been there.

46:22.282 --> 46:26.912
I am sorry that I named
a stupid baseball bat after you.

46:29.665 --> 46:32.751
I'm sorry for all the pain
that I put you through.

46:38.632 --> 46:40.717
I hope that you found someone
in the afterlife

46:40.801 --> 46:43.512
and you're screwing your brains out.

46:44.096 --> 46:47.850
Well... not really,

46:47.933 --> 46:50.894
but... fair is fair.

46:54.982 --> 46:56.400
I miss you.

46:59.653 --> 47:01.864

If we find anything,
I'll bring some by your cabin.

48:18.065 --> 48:19.691
That won't be necessary.

48:20.192 --> 48:23.070
In fact, that whole situation
isn't going to work out.

48:24.029 --> 48:26.990
I came by here hoping that maybe
you could requisition a car for me.

48:27.074 --> 48:29.368
I could bring back my stuff.

48:30.035 --> 48:32.454
Yeah, I'll ask Gabriel to approve that.

48:34.456 --> 48:36.416
If you stay here, she will kill you.

48:37.793 --> 48:40.337
I just didn't want your death
on my conscience.

48:41.672 --> 48:43.006
Now it's not.

48:43.882 --> 48:44.967
Fair enough.
