WEBVTT

01:37.787 --> 01:38.684
Stop.

01:42.516 --> 01:43.448
Stop.

02:30.598 --> 02:31.496
Who are you?

03:16.851 --> 03:17.887
It isn't time.

03:20.717 --> 03:21.615
No.

03:27.068 --> 03:29.278
Promise me you'll
get to safety.

03:41.773 --> 03:43.257
I'm so sorry.

03:45.466 --> 03:46.640
You're needed elsewhere.

03:49.367 --> 03:50.264
It would appear so.

04:16.773 --> 04:17.533
Sir.

04:23.504 --> 04:24.609
If you wanna follow me.

04:33.376 --> 04:35.585
I know the way. Thank you.

04:50.462 --> 04:51.325
Thanks.

04:54.639 --> 04:56.641
I'll get straight to it.

04:56.675 --> 04:57.366
Sir.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.472
Ivy Levine,

05:04.476 --> 05:05.891
I understand you know her?

05:10.620 --> 05:12.829
I grew up with an Ivy Levine.

05:14.555 --> 05:16.833
So she would know that
you are in the forces.

05:16.868 --> 05:17.627
I'm sure of it.

05:21.907 --> 05:24.634
It seems the poor
girl married a Frenchman

05:27.637 --> 05:29.052
who was missing, presumed dead.

05:30.813 --> 05:31.503
Until now.

05:36.474 --> 05:38.061
This arrived earlier
this morning.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.029
Via Phileas.

05:42.065 --> 05:42.963
Phileas?

05:43.860 --> 05:44.861
Carrier, pigeon.

05:47.001 --> 05:48.762
Poor bugger, lost a
foot delivering that.

05:54.595 --> 05:56.804
Ivy is now part of
the resistance movement

05:57.840 --> 05:59.393
but she's requesting our help

06:00.187 --> 06:01.533
in the absence of her husband,

06:01.568 --> 06:03.673
she's assuming
command of their cell.

06:06.055 --> 06:08.713
They have found a Nazi bunker

06:09.714 --> 06:12.682
that could be holding munitions,

06:12.717 --> 06:14.684
important prisoners,
God knows what else.

06:18.205 --> 06:21.657
I doubt we can trust
this information, sir.

06:21.691 --> 06:25.764
No, but if we can
disturb the enemy, we must,

06:29.181 --> 06:32.737
we'd heard whispers
of a weapons cachet,

06:32.771 --> 06:36.879
with this information, it would
be easier for us to find it.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.541
I want you to go over to France

06:43.575 --> 06:45.059
and make a nuisance of yourself.

06:47.234 --> 06:48.787
I know you're
rather good at that.

06:50.996 --> 06:52.653
She mentions a broken radio.

06:54.897 --> 06:55.794
Yes.

06:57.244 --> 06:58.694
Unfortunate that,

07:00.143 --> 07:03.423
but at least she's
noted a drop off point.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.633
It's not much to go on, sir.

07:08.807 --> 07:12.846
If you find this bunker,
I want you to blow it up.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.227
And if along the way you find
this poor girl's husband,

07:15.262 --> 07:17.057
that's one of life's bonuses.

07:20.578 --> 07:24.167
You're going to need
an explosives expert.

07:24.202 --> 07:25.686
This is the only
man I can spare.

07:27.274 --> 07:29.138
Quite frankly. He's
become a liability.

07:31.036 --> 07:32.244
I'm sure he'll cope.

07:35.109 --> 07:36.076
You leave at dusk.

07:38.009 --> 07:39.666
Report to the 138 as usual.

07:41.909 --> 07:43.704
Eli Sanna will pick
you up in two days.

07:46.189 --> 07:47.467
You better get a move on.

07:49.192 --> 07:51.263
Otherwise you'll have to
find your own way back.

07:52.782 --> 07:54.059
Any other provisions, sir?

07:56.303 --> 07:58.478
And I think you can
fit into a briefcase.

08:06.209 --> 08:07.003
You can take that with you.

08:07.038 --> 08:08.522
Thank you, sir.

08:11.663 --> 08:13.527
Good luck Banks.

08:13.562 --> 08:14.286
Sir.

09:31.709 --> 09:36.576
Come on.

10:27.005 --> 10:28.800
Not now.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.002
Up.

11:30.551 --> 11:31.449
Paul.

11:35.108 --> 11:36.350
Where is he?

11:45.394 --> 11:48.466
Where is he?

12:00.409 --> 12:01.410
Jesus.

13:23.941 --> 13:24.942
Charles Somerton.

13:26.875 --> 13:27.599
Yes sir.

13:30.361 --> 13:31.051
Come with me.

13:39.059 --> 13:40.474
Wouldn't let anyone
else touch him.

13:40.509 --> 13:41.613
Understandable.

13:43.339 --> 13:45.583
Told him to be careful,
but he wouldn't listen.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.964
And now look.

13:46.998 --> 13:48.310
I can lip read.

13:48.344 --> 13:49.035
Barely.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.039
Tell the army they
won't be needing him.

13:53.073 --> 13:55.351
Not in this state. He's no
good to anyone, I suppose.

13:55.386 --> 13:56.628
I don't know about that.

13:56.663 --> 13:58.389
He has been given
a new assignment.

14:00.943 --> 14:01.910
I won't ask.

14:01.944 --> 14:03.290
Good.

14:03.325 --> 14:04.360
I can't tell.

14:05.672 --> 14:07.501
Do you hear that?

14:07.536 --> 14:08.951
They're shipping you off,

14:08.986 --> 14:11.160
making use of your
talents elsewhere.

14:11.195 --> 14:12.472
No joke?

14:12.506 --> 14:16.338
I need an explosives
and a munitions expert.

14:16.372 --> 14:18.202
So try not to blow
yourself up again.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.274
He blew a hole in the
garden when he was about 10.

14:21.308 --> 14:23.483
Mom was furious.
Just before my time.

14:23.517 --> 14:25.174
We have a car outside.

14:25.209 --> 14:27.487
A car waiting to
take us to Tempsford

14:27.521 --> 14:28.937
be as quick as you can.

14:28.971 --> 14:30.248
Go and get dressed.

14:40.534 --> 14:41.915
He'll get the job done.

14:43.123 --> 14:44.055
I'm counting on it.

14:46.989 --> 14:49.302
Looks like you have
your hands full here.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.063
We do what we can.

14:54.272 --> 14:54.963
Indeed.

14:57.172 --> 14:58.932
What's it like over there?

15:04.110 --> 15:06.353
Hard to describe, I'm afraid.

15:10.599 --> 15:12.221
I'll, I'll wait outside.

15:26.442 --> 15:27.374
Be careful.

15:30.343 --> 15:31.689
I thought I was going home.

15:33.277 --> 15:35.589
Turns out life's got
other plans for me. Eh?

15:38.385 --> 15:41.630
He seems important, so
try to impress him, yes?

15:42.562 --> 15:43.459
Yes.

15:45.530 --> 15:46.324
Take care, Sammy.

16:08.450 --> 16:11.004
You all right
with flying Charlie?

16:11.039 --> 16:12.488
Not really, sir.

16:12.523 --> 16:14.111
Call me Banks.

16:14.145 --> 16:15.215
I've had all the
necessary training.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.183
I'm just not a fan of airplanes.

16:17.217 --> 16:18.425
You'll be fine.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.669
Take this, I want you
to write me a list,

16:20.703 --> 16:24.155
a short list of everything
you definitely need.

16:24.190 --> 16:26.157
We'll see what we
can get for you.

16:26.192 --> 16:28.746
First, we need a more
suitable set of clothing.

16:30.403 --> 16:31.300
Thank you.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.618
Sir, is this going
to be dangerous?

16:40.861 --> 16:42.173
Sorry.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.485
Stupid bloody question.

17:41.612 --> 17:42.854
What have we got?

17:42.889 --> 17:44.546
Plastics.

17:44.580 --> 17:45.788
Will that survive the trip?

17:45.823 --> 17:47.721
It's the only choice.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.654
It's a lot less
volatile than dynamite.

17:49.689 --> 17:52.140
It's less susceptible
to vibrations.

17:52.174 --> 17:54.349
It won't go pop without
an electrical charge.

17:54.383 --> 17:56.558
Preferably from a detonator.

17:56.592 --> 17:58.525
Would you like
our clothes to fit?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.734
- Usually helps.
- Then try them on.

18:00.769 --> 18:02.633
We'll take a radio with us.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.738
As if we haven't
got enough to carry.

18:04.773 --> 18:06.188
I'll need some more fabric.

18:06.223 --> 18:07.879
Don't go anywhere
until you've tried on

18:07.914 --> 18:10.779
the rest of the
clothing, please.

18:10.813 --> 18:12.367
I think he's talking to you.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.404
So are you going to
tell me what we're doing?

18:16.716 --> 18:18.235
I'll fill you in
once we're airborne.

18:19.512 --> 18:21.686
May I at least know
where we're going?

19:42.042 --> 19:43.423
I'm English. No, no.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.011
I'm Charles. My name is Charlie.

19:45.045 --> 19:46.426
I'm Charlie.

19:46.461 --> 19:48.463
I saw two of you drop.
Where's the other one?

19:48.497 --> 19:50.327
My name is
Charlie. I'm Charles.

19:50.361 --> 19:52.605
What are you doing here?

19:52.639 --> 19:53.330
He's with me.

19:54.917 --> 19:57.230
Perhaps you could ask your
boy to lower his weapon.

19:58.645 --> 20:00.958
.

20:08.759 --> 20:09.656
Hello, Ivy.

20:11.486 --> 20:12.935
Sorry about that.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.317
Couldn't be sure it was you
till I heard your voice.

20:15.352 --> 20:16.284
That's it. Just
the two of you?

20:16.318 --> 20:17.940
Yes, just the two of us.

20:17.975 --> 20:20.840
And radio. Some
explosives, some weapons.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.843
All we could spare, I'm afraid.

20:23.877 --> 20:24.775
Shall we?

20:52.975 --> 20:54.563
Will you be able to control him?

20:54.598 --> 20:55.495
He'll be fine.

20:56.393 --> 20:58.015
How well do you know him?

20:58.049 --> 21:00.293
He's been with us
two years, maybe more.

21:01.674 --> 21:03.538
He's a good man.

21:03.572 --> 21:06.334
Young. Yes, but capable.

21:06.368 --> 21:08.474
Well, I need to know
that he can follow orders.

21:08.508 --> 21:11.062
Act. I need to know that
you can follow orders.

21:11.097 --> 21:13.030
Now, what's that
supposed to mean?

21:13.064 --> 21:14.307
Well, since Paul disappeared,

21:14.342 --> 21:15.929
I've been the one to guide them.

21:17.137 --> 21:19.036
Just because we used
to know each other

21:19.070 --> 21:21.383
doesn't mean I'm a soft touch.

21:21.418 --> 21:23.005
I know what's
at stake, Robert.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.593
Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

21:25.905 --> 21:27.562
You have no idea what
it's been like here.

21:29.426 --> 21:30.530
That's where you're wrong.

21:32.532 --> 21:34.051
Don't assume I'm the
person you remember.

21:36.536 --> 21:37.951
I won't.

21:37.986 --> 21:40.678
I'm the only one with
military rank, I'm in charge.

21:40.713 --> 21:41.472
Do you understand?

21:45.683 --> 21:46.684
Do you understand?

21:48.755 --> 21:50.516
I understand.

21:50.550 --> 21:52.380
Good. Ready?

22:28.519 --> 22:29.417
It's safe.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.117
Jean, Banks. Banks, Jean.

22:45.778 --> 22:47.020
Photographs.

22:47.055 --> 22:47.952
Jean.

22:49.851 --> 22:50.714
Follow us.

23:04.728 --> 23:06.419
What have you done to
her? She looks petrified.

23:06.454 --> 23:07.696
Just asked her
a few questions.

23:07.731 --> 23:08.973
Leave.

23:09.008 --> 23:10.423
I'm not going anywhere.

23:10.458 --> 23:12.183
Leave now or the
whole thing is off.

23:12.218 --> 23:13.668
I get on the radio.

23:13.702 --> 23:15.186
I take Charlie and our
supplies and we are gone.

23:16.533 --> 23:17.119
Do as I say.

23:20.019 --> 23:20.916
Now.

23:44.561 --> 23:46.770
All right, look, look, look.

23:51.637 --> 23:52.154
It's okay.

24:15.695 --> 24:20.700
As I understand it,
you've come from a bunker.

24:20.735 --> 24:23.876
You've provided us with
photographs of the interior.

24:23.910 --> 24:26.292
You know the inner
layout of the place,

24:26.326 --> 24:27.880
and you might be able
to help us get there.

24:27.914 --> 24:29.157
Is that correct?

24:29.191 --> 24:30.710
Yes.

24:30.745 --> 24:32.574
Are you willing to help us?

24:32.609 --> 24:34.300
Yes.

24:34.334 --> 24:36.267
And you think you
can find the way there?

24:36.302 --> 24:37.268
I hope so.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.616
Why should I believe you?

24:43.102 --> 24:45.829
I risked my life to get here.

24:45.863 --> 24:48.038
I saw what was happening
and I had to get out.

24:49.211 --> 24:50.730
Is Paul there?

24:52.560 --> 24:53.284
Yes.

24:54.147 --> 24:55.045
He's alive.

24:55.942 --> 24:57.219
I tended to him myself.

24:58.704 --> 25:02.086
If any part of
what you've told me

25:02.121 --> 25:03.536
turns out to be untrue,

25:06.781 --> 25:08.955
there will be consequences.

25:08.990 --> 25:09.680
You understand?

25:13.753 --> 25:14.754
Yes.

25:14.789 --> 25:16.618
Good.

25:16.653 --> 25:17.619
Tell me about Paul.

25:59.799 --> 26:01.145
Did you get your photos?

26:02.388 --> 26:02.906
- Yes.
- Did you take your photos?

26:02.940 --> 26:03.838
Yes.

26:08.118 --> 26:12.985
And my things?

26:20.440 --> 26:22.788
And the map, the map?

26:31.106 --> 26:33.177
This is where you must go.

26:33.212 --> 26:34.593
You can help me.

26:36.422 --> 26:37.699
I can help you.

26:39.425 --> 26:40.322
My wife.

26:41.841 --> 26:45.224
You must speak to
my wife, please.

26:45.258 --> 26:46.190
I can't do this.

26:46.225 --> 26:47.778
You can.

26:47.813 --> 26:48.330
You can.

26:49.987 --> 26:50.678
Please.

26:53.059 --> 26:53.957
Please.

29:40.364 --> 29:43.091
You have no idea what
they're doing in there.

29:46.301 --> 29:48.545
Beyond keeping those men
alive on unknown drugs?

29:49.615 --> 29:51.479
No. I'm sorry.

29:51.513 --> 29:53.170
Why not dig themselves?

29:54.551 --> 29:57.174
They only have a
handful of soldiers.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.866
Why use up your own manpower?

29:58.900 --> 30:01.385
When there's prisoners to
do the heavy lifting for you?

30:05.355 --> 30:06.528
What will they do to me?

30:10.912 --> 30:14.467
Just keep cooperating
for the time being, okay?

30:17.125 --> 30:18.609
All right. First things first.

30:18.644 --> 30:21.440
We need to get you cleaned
up. Come, come with me.

30:47.328 --> 30:48.398
Not for your eyes.

30:53.575 --> 30:54.507
Hold still.

31:13.423 --> 31:15.701
I don't see any images of
missions as we talked about.

31:15.735 --> 31:16.460
So what are they
doing down there?

31:16.495 --> 31:18.255
Why do they need
so many workers?

31:18.290 --> 31:21.396
This is architectural plans.

31:21.431 --> 31:24.503
Okay, so it could be a
cachet, just not for weapons.

31:24.537 --> 31:25.642
They're digging
for something, sir.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.540
But I need a closer look.

31:27.575 --> 31:29.611
What I can tell you is this,

31:29.646 --> 31:32.028
if what they're doing is
a few feet under concrete,

31:33.339 --> 31:35.479
we don't have enough
explosives, sir.

31:35.514 --> 31:36.239
Even make a dent.

31:37.516 --> 31:39.138
Saskia said they're
using hand tools.

31:39.173 --> 31:40.553
Been at it for months.

31:42.107 --> 31:43.660
What can you tell us
about any of this?

31:43.694 --> 31:45.489
I wasn't told anything.

31:45.524 --> 31:46.628
Of course not.

31:48.458 --> 31:52.911
My orders were to keep those
men alive as long as possible

31:53.704 --> 31:55.983
by any means necessary.

31:56.017 --> 31:58.157
What about defenses?

31:58.192 --> 31:59.918
I can only tell
you what I've seen,

32:01.402 --> 32:02.748
but what will happen to me?

32:02.782 --> 32:04.715
I'm not sure I follow.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.614
As in what do we do with her?

32:10.307 --> 32:14.070
Oh, she's coming with us.

32:16.693 --> 32:18.315
No, I don't wanna go back there.

32:18.350 --> 32:19.558
If you don't want
to go back there,

32:19.592 --> 32:20.697
you cease to be
of any use to us.

32:22.009 --> 32:23.424
You understand what that means?

32:23.458 --> 32:24.701
She's right. You
can't stay here.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.461
No, I. I'll leave.

32:26.496 --> 32:28.394
I'll just run whichever
direction you point me. Please.

32:28.429 --> 32:30.086
I, I can't go back.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.640
We can't let you go.
You are either with us or-

32:32.674 --> 32:33.675
Or dead.

32:37.369 --> 32:38.715
How kind of you.

32:38.749 --> 32:39.647
Shut up.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.481
Are you sure about this?

32:46.516 --> 32:48.725
She's the only one who can
possibly get us back there.

32:50.071 --> 32:51.245
Can you get us back there?

32:52.211 --> 32:53.488
- But-
- No.

32:53.523 --> 32:55.697
Do you have any
better suggestions?

32:58.286 --> 33:00.530
Perhaps you'd like to
kill her in cold blood.

33:03.705 --> 33:04.603
No.

33:06.053 --> 33:06.674
Good.

33:09.849 --> 33:10.747
We need rest.

33:12.059 --> 33:13.198
Four hours.

33:13.232 --> 33:15.786
Sleep, then we leave.

33:24.209 --> 33:25.106
Here.

33:28.489 --> 33:29.731
Prefer tea anyway.

33:43.193 --> 33:44.367
You can't be sure about her.

33:44.401 --> 33:45.851
You can't be
sure about anyone.

33:45.885 --> 33:48.095
They could have tortured him.
So he told them where to go.

33:48.129 --> 33:49.786
Sent her to lead us
straight into a trap.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.167
That'd be stretching things.

33:51.201 --> 33:52.513
She'll hand us
over to the Germans

33:52.547 --> 33:53.721
the first chance she gets.

33:53.755 --> 33:55.274
Do you really believe that?

33:55.309 --> 33:56.724
She could have disappeared
from that bunker

33:56.758 --> 33:58.346
and been halfway to
Switzerland by now.

33:58.381 --> 34:00.693
She wants to help.
She came here to help.

34:00.728 --> 34:03.351
She's given us no reason
not to trust what she says.

34:04.904 --> 34:06.285
And if you wake up with
a knife in your back?

34:06.320 --> 34:07.355
I'll check it
wasn't you first.

34:11.394 --> 34:13.879
Why have you always
been so argumentative?

34:13.913 --> 34:15.087
I'm not.

34:21.162 --> 34:24.441
Paul and I weren't
exactly on good terms

34:24.476 --> 34:25.546
when he was captured.

34:27.272 --> 34:30.620
I can't help but think our
arguments clouded his judgment

34:30.654 --> 34:32.898
got him caught in
the first place.

34:32.932 --> 34:34.348
He made his own choices.

34:36.212 --> 34:37.765
He wanted to end
things between us.

34:44.634 --> 34:47.499
If there's a chance
that we can save Paul.

34:47.533 --> 34:49.121
We have to take it, yes?

34:50.260 --> 34:51.675
Absolutely.

34:51.710 --> 34:53.539
This is that chance.

34:53.574 --> 34:54.264
This is it.

34:57.302 --> 34:58.855
Someone needs to stay here.

34:58.889 --> 35:00.408
Look after this place.

35:00.443 --> 35:02.134
Jean.

35:02.169 --> 35:03.515
He's our most
experienced soldier.

35:03.549 --> 35:05.379
He's too old.

35:05.413 --> 35:07.277
And from what I've seen, this
place is on its last legs.

35:07.312 --> 35:08.692
You've got one hot
head, one child.

35:08.727 --> 35:11.419
- She's 19.
- One very stubborn leader.

35:14.871 --> 35:17.494
If this is a trap,
I'll kill myself.

35:19.358 --> 35:20.773
Well, we're outnumbered,
under resourced.

35:20.808 --> 35:22.396
Lacking key personnel.

35:22.430 --> 35:24.570
If we even get to the
bunker, it'll be a miracle.

35:26.434 --> 35:27.125
What?

35:29.610 --> 35:30.507
We'll be fine.

35:32.302 --> 35:32.820
Trust me.

35:34.580 --> 35:35.271
Take these.

35:36.444 --> 35:37.169
Get some rest.

35:40.241 --> 35:41.242
Rest, Ivy.

36:05.991 --> 36:07.372
It isn't time.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.649
Stop. Give me a hand.

36:46.514 --> 36:47.619
Calm, calm.

36:49.724 --> 36:50.863
She says she's sorry.

36:57.422 --> 36:58.595
I didn't expect it.
She came out of nowhere.

36:58.630 --> 36:59.941
All right. Alright.

36:59.976 --> 37:00.977
- I didn't-
- Calm, calm, calm.

37:01.011 --> 37:01.978
What happened?

37:02.012 --> 37:03.393
What happened?

37:11.539 --> 37:13.058
She brought him a coffee.

37:13.092 --> 37:14.956
He didn't see it.
She surprised him.

37:14.991 --> 37:17.062
He reacted, it's as
misunderstanding.

37:20.617 --> 37:21.515
Calm, calm, calm.

37:21.549 --> 37:24.449
Listen. He can't, he can't hear.

37:24.483 --> 37:26.416
Okay. He can't
hear properly now.

37:26.451 --> 37:27.831
I think you just,
you frightened him.

37:27.866 --> 37:29.039
That's all. That's all.

37:29.074 --> 37:30.765
I'm sorry.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.940
I didn't mean to to hurt you.

37:32.974 --> 37:36.323
Or, or, or, or, or touch
you. I was-

37:40.741 --> 37:42.363
You quite finished?

37:46.988 --> 37:49.784
You get a hold of
yourself, Charlie.

37:49.819 --> 37:53.754
Everybody calm down and
get ready. We leave in 10.

37:53.788 --> 37:54.824
Saskia.

37:55.894 --> 37:56.791
Saskia.

37:58.034 --> 38:01.831
I need this one
moving in 10 minutes.

38:12.945 --> 38:13.670
Good luck, huh?

38:18.744 --> 38:19.435
Onwards.

39:14.559 --> 39:15.387
One of ours?

39:16.871 --> 39:18.459
Lancaster.

39:18.494 --> 39:19.391
Bristol.

39:21.497 --> 39:22.912
That's not a guess, is it?

39:22.946 --> 39:23.740
I'm afraid not.

39:29.539 --> 39:31.783
Troops patrol
much of this land.

39:31.817 --> 39:34.130
They're killing survivors
and stopping transports.

39:35.131 --> 39:36.408
We need to be on guard.

39:37.996 --> 39:40.378
We'll stay off the beaten
track as much as possible.

41:08.224 --> 41:10.053
Was this you?

41:10.088 --> 41:11.641
- Was this you?
- No.

41:11.676 --> 41:12.815
No.

41:12.849 --> 41:14.264
- How could she know?
- No, let go.

41:14.299 --> 41:15.231
She didn't know.

41:15.265 --> 41:19.131
They set traps. Enemy set traps.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.754
It's what they do.

41:20.788 --> 41:21.962
It's what we do.

41:22.859 --> 41:23.826
She didn't know.

41:26.967 --> 41:27.692
She didn't know.

41:28.658 --> 41:30.142
Charlie, check ahead.

41:35.147 --> 41:36.873
Okay.

41:36.908 --> 41:38.323
I'm going on ahead.

41:38.357 --> 41:40.739
You wait one minute.
Bring the others, okay?

42:50.740 --> 42:51.258
Go. Go.

43:22.013 --> 43:23.670
We need to find
somewhere to rest.

43:25.119 --> 43:26.949
How far did you travel?

43:26.983 --> 43:28.675
It was day and night.

43:28.709 --> 43:31.401
And you're sure we're
headed in the right direction?

43:31.436 --> 43:34.197
That road, snakes in
and out of the woods.

43:34.232 --> 43:35.716
Paul made me memorize it.

43:35.751 --> 43:38.823
He knew it would lead me
back to the farmhouse.

43:38.857 --> 43:41.446
We went over it
studying the maps.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.344
He knew everything
about this land.

43:44.449 --> 43:45.346
That's Paul.

43:47.245 --> 43:48.315
We'll find some cover.

44:01.362 --> 44:02.985
Charlie.

44:03.019 --> 44:03.986
Charlie.

44:04.020 --> 44:04.711
Go round.

44:13.236 --> 44:14.375
Shouldn't you
send someone else?

44:14.410 --> 44:16.446
Charlie knows what
he's looking for.

44:16.481 --> 44:18.414
He's our best
chance of survival.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.347
You just concentrate on Vincent.

44:20.381 --> 44:23.074
Get him to obey orders
before I intervene.

44:23.108 --> 44:26.111
He's gonna get us all killed
if he doesn't change his ways.

44:26.146 --> 44:28.113
Believe me, I would love
to punch his lights out.

44:28.148 --> 44:30.081
Maybe you should.

44:30.115 --> 44:32.773
That's what we
have. Bigger problems.

44:32.808 --> 44:34.499
You could be right.

44:34.533 --> 44:36.708
Lastly, I had to talk to him.

44:36.743 --> 44:38.296
I think he's got a
soft spot for her.

46:04.831 --> 46:07.074
Don't go too far.

46:07.109 --> 46:07.799
I won't.

46:22.883 --> 46:24.989
When did you
get so tough, Ivy?

46:26.991 --> 46:29.545
10 Years on a farm,
husband who's a fighter.

46:30.546 --> 46:31.443
Rubs off.

46:35.447 --> 46:36.932
I haven't seen you rest.

46:36.966 --> 46:38.519
Oh, someone needs
to keep watch.

46:38.554 --> 46:39.451
Let me.

46:40.211 --> 46:41.212
I'm fine.

46:49.910 --> 46:51.325
Good?

46:51.360 --> 46:52.050
It's perfect.

47:04.304 --> 47:05.167
Thank you.

47:15.936 --> 47:18.490
She's lost four
older brothers.

47:19.353 --> 47:21.942
How could she bear it?

47:21.977 --> 47:23.875
Charlie seems to have
taken a shine to her.

47:27.430 --> 47:29.122
How long have you known him?

47:29.156 --> 47:30.433
Not long.

47:30.468 --> 47:31.952
What do you think of him?

47:31.987 --> 47:33.609
Doesn't matter
what I think of him.

47:34.403 --> 47:35.542
He can do the job.

47:35.576 --> 47:36.923
Despite the obvious?

47:38.131 --> 47:40.098
I read the Army
incident report,

47:40.133 --> 47:42.963
what happened wasn't his fault.

47:42.998 --> 47:44.896
Somebody set up a
test explosives run.

47:44.931 --> 47:46.415
Didn't use the proper protocols.

47:46.449 --> 47:48.279
Charlie stepped
in to save lives.

47:50.005 --> 47:53.422
From what I've heard,
he also took the blame.

47:53.456 --> 47:54.630
Lost any chance
of hearing again?

47:54.664 --> 47:56.597
Oh, we've all lost something.

48:01.154 --> 48:05.365
I'm sorry about you and
Paul, it's not easy.

48:06.607 --> 48:08.195
I'm coming to terms with that.

48:14.063 --> 48:15.168
Can we do this?

48:19.655 --> 48:21.519
Have you ever killed anyone?

48:21.553 --> 48:22.485
Get some rest.

49:45.396 --> 49:48.261
There is a man named Steiner.

49:51.505 --> 49:53.231
He's the head of operations.

49:57.753 --> 49:59.272
He tortures the prisoners.

50:09.489 --> 50:12.595
He forced us to
keep the men alive.

50:12.630 --> 50:14.011
Forced us to drug them.

50:16.323 --> 50:19.257
Me and Lena, the other nurse,

50:19.292 --> 50:22.088
we used all our strengths
to hold them down.

50:23.296 --> 50:26.402
We were fed and
they were so weak.

50:26.437 --> 50:28.094
I could see the
fear in their eyes.

50:30.889 --> 50:32.408
I just kept calling.

51:59.978 --> 52:03.327
If they wouldn't follow the
orders, they would beat us.

52:03.361 --> 52:06.709
Anybody who tried to run
away, they just used them

52:06.744 --> 52:08.194
as a punching bag.

52:08.228 --> 52:11.231
The men, I mean, what
was I supposed to?

52:21.448 --> 52:23.726
When I was burying the bodies,

52:25.728 --> 52:28.421
I realized that
that was my way out.

52:29.905 --> 52:31.907
I had no concept of time.

52:31.941 --> 52:34.979
I just saw more
beam of the sunlight

52:35.013 --> 52:37.395
and on the bottom
of the furnace.

52:37.430 --> 52:41.503
And I could crawl inside
and I could see daylight.

52:47.025 --> 52:48.406
Then I met Paul.

52:51.237 --> 52:55.172
I just knew it, I had to leave.

52:56.242 --> 52:58.382
I couldn't take it anymore.

52:59.969 --> 53:02.627
Bastard, ruling by fear.

53:06.838 --> 53:08.944
He's not to be underestimated.

53:09.910 --> 53:12.396
I'll bear that in mind.

53:12.430 --> 53:13.224
Thank you.

53:15.571 --> 53:16.814
Get some sleep.

54:14.423 --> 54:15.735
Why did Paul trust you?

54:17.668 --> 54:18.531
I kept him alive.

54:19.566 --> 54:21.016
I tried to keep everybody alive.

54:21.050 --> 54:22.431
Keep them enslaved.

54:23.639 --> 54:25.434
It was my job.

54:55.878 --> 54:56.879
Slow down.

56:01.841 --> 56:02.842
Press here.

56:47.818 --> 56:48.922
Help me.

57:19.919 --> 57:21.507
What do we do now?

57:21.541 --> 57:22.473
We carry on.

57:22.508 --> 57:24.164
How?

57:24.199 --> 57:26.788
You didn't expect this
to be easy, did you?

57:26.822 --> 57:28.514
I didn't know what to do.

57:28.548 --> 57:31.275
Well, when the shooting
starts, it's always chaos.

57:31.309 --> 57:32.897
There are five of us.

57:32.932 --> 57:34.727
We're always outnumbered.

57:34.761 --> 57:36.004
Always the underdogs.

57:37.005 --> 57:38.903
Pay your respects and carry on.

57:41.561 --> 57:43.011
- Paul's dead, isn't he?
- We don't know that.

57:43.045 --> 57:44.668
Are we just gonna
leave them here?

57:44.702 --> 57:45.979
There's nothing
we can do for them.

57:46.014 --> 57:48.257
Just take what you
can and get moving.

57:48.292 --> 57:50.087
Sir, we're not burying?

57:50.121 --> 57:51.260
No, we are not burying them.

57:51.295 --> 57:52.710
We are moving on.

57:52.745 --> 57:54.988
Saskia, Charlie with me.

58:42.622 --> 58:44.106
Charlie. Charlie.

58:45.349 --> 58:46.799
Set the whole thing on fire.

58:48.766 --> 58:49.284
Burn it.

59:03.056 --> 59:05.265
.

59:16.173 --> 59:17.968
Do not breath this in.

59:18.002 --> 59:18.900
Poison.

59:18.934 --> 59:19.970
- No.
- What?

59:21.972 --> 59:23.283
It's from the bunker.

59:23.318 --> 59:24.768
They must have been
using the furnace.

59:24.802 --> 59:25.320
Meaning?

59:27.322 --> 59:28.599
It's human ash.

59:31.015 --> 59:32.120
Jesus Christ.

59:58.387 --> 01:00:00.389
What are they doing?

01:00:00.424 --> 01:00:03.013
They had the men digging
for as long as I was there.

01:00:03.047 --> 01:00:04.911
So this is just
a dumping ground?

01:00:04.946 --> 01:00:06.292
Yes.

01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:07.224
You ready for this?

01:00:07.258 --> 01:00:09.709
What for? What's the plan?

01:00:09.744 --> 01:00:11.090
How far to the
furnace chimneys?

01:00:12.229 --> 01:00:13.195
It's just minutes.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.989
Which direction?

01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:17.752
A straight line.

01:00:17.786 --> 01:00:19.270
And Ivy, I want
you and butcher

01:00:19.305 --> 01:00:20.858
to take everything with you.

01:00:20.893 --> 01:00:23.102
Get to the fence.
Make sure it's clear.

01:00:23.136 --> 01:00:24.172
- And wait-
- What for?

01:00:24.206 --> 01:00:26.070
As soon as it's safe,

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:28.935
we'll send a signal, lower the
equipment down and join us.

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.144
- I can't do this.
- Come on. We've got this far.

01:00:32.283 --> 01:00:34.458
I didn't expect to be here.

01:00:34.492 --> 01:00:36.287
I thought I escaped this place.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.643
Take this.

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:48.230
Take it.

01:00:52.476 --> 01:00:54.754
One of us now, you understand?

01:00:56.342 --> 01:00:57.895
Yes.

01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:58.724
Good.

01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:02.762
If we're going in
through the chimney,

01:01:02.797 --> 01:01:04.177
how are you getting in?

01:01:06.386 --> 01:01:08.457
I thought we'd
try the front door.

01:01:09.527 --> 01:01:10.528
Follow my lead.

01:01:10.563 --> 01:01:12.289
I've done some stupid
things in my time, sir.

01:01:12.323 --> 01:01:14.325
Just go with it.
Do you understand?

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.017
And if this doesn't bloody work.

01:01:16.051 --> 01:01:17.328
We're all dead.

01:01:19.123 --> 01:01:21.125
Hey. Hey Mark.

01:02:37.339 --> 01:02:38.858
Sorry about that.

01:02:38.893 --> 01:02:40.239
It worked. That's
all that matters.

01:02:41.102 --> 01:02:41.999
Good.

01:02:51.975 --> 01:02:54.253
Straight into
the lion's den. Eh?

01:02:54.287 --> 01:02:54.943
Which way?

01:02:56.255 --> 01:02:57.325
This way to the furnace.

01:02:57.359 --> 01:02:59.016
You don't look sure.

01:02:59.051 --> 01:03:00.328
I don't know.

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:02.157
Everything was
restricted access.

01:03:02.192 --> 01:03:03.296
Charlie.

01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:05.057
I saw pictures of a radio room.

01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:07.300
Beds, empty cells.

01:03:07.335 --> 01:03:08.612
How about we split up?

01:03:08.646 --> 01:03:10.200
I'll meet with the furnace
as soon as I've seen

01:03:10.234 --> 01:03:12.271
what's up here, go.

01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:16.965
Go.

01:04:03.909 --> 01:04:05.393
The bag is stuck.

01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:45.725
It's in here.

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:39.382
Are you okay?

01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:40.348
I think so.

01:09:41.694 --> 01:09:42.488
Where's Banks?

01:09:42.523 --> 01:09:43.731
Gone to investigate.

01:09:43.765 --> 01:09:44.870
Have you seen Paul?

01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:45.940
No, not yet.

01:09:45.974 --> 01:09:46.872
Okay.

01:09:49.737 --> 01:09:50.772
On your own?

01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:15.383
Gunshot.

01:10:15.418 --> 01:10:15.935
Gunshot.

01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:18.904
I'm gonna find Paul.

01:10:30.536 --> 01:10:32.538
Shit.

01:12:11.741 --> 01:12:12.535
Wait.

01:12:14.778 --> 01:12:15.572
What?

01:12:16.677 --> 01:12:18.092
15.

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:19.749
I can't hear you.

01:12:22.614 --> 01:12:23.615
15.

01:12:23.649 --> 01:12:24.995
15?

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:27.998
- Minutes.
- In 15 minutes.

01:12:28.033 --> 01:12:29.897
Yes what?

01:12:29.931 --> 01:12:31.381
Show me. Show me.

01:12:34.626 --> 01:12:35.420
Soldiers.

01:12:36.213 --> 01:12:37.111
More?

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:38.733
In 15, more? We have to go.

01:12:38.768 --> 01:12:40.114
We have to go.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:43.635
Come on, come on.

01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:44.360
Come on.

01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:55.094
Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:59.167
Stop, stop it, stop.

01:13:00.617 --> 01:13:01.515
Stop.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.227
Take her.

01:15:12.991 --> 01:15:14.579
It isn't time.

01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:17.961
No.

01:15:23.277 --> 01:15:24.761
Promise me you'll get to safety.

01:15:38.326 --> 01:15:39.224
I'm so sorry.

01:15:41.226 --> 01:15:42.917
You are needed elsewhere.

01:15:45.195 --> 01:15:46.576
It would appear so.

01:15:51.995 --> 01:15:55.274
Promise me, second you
hear that Air rain siren.

01:15:55.309 --> 01:15:58.381
The second you hear it,
you'll get to the shelter.

01:15:58.415 --> 01:15:59.313
I will.

01:16:00.935 --> 01:16:02.074
Promise me.

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:07.597
I promise.

01:16:11.739 --> 01:16:13.327
What if I don't...

01:16:16.848 --> 01:16:21.611
What if I don't want
to fight anymore?

01:16:26.202 --> 01:16:30.171
I know you don't
want to, but you will.

01:16:32.035 --> 01:16:33.381
To keep others safe.

01:16:37.178 --> 01:16:38.732
To keep me safe.

01:17:32.337 --> 01:17:34.028
It isn't time.

01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:56.741
To keep safe.

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:15.725
It isn't time.

01:19:39.982 --> 01:19:40.499
Ivy.

01:19:45.573 --> 01:19:46.851
What happened to you?

01:19:46.885 --> 01:19:48.197
Big bastard downstairs.

01:19:48.231 --> 01:19:49.336
Steiner.

01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:51.234
I think that's the chap.

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:53.167
They called for reinforcement.

01:19:53.202 --> 01:19:54.065
How long have we got?

01:19:54.099 --> 01:19:55.238
10 minutes max.

01:19:55.273 --> 01:19:56.826
Charlie, you're up.

01:19:59.104 --> 01:20:00.416
So what did you
find down there?

01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:01.969
Gold. Tons of it.

01:20:02.004 --> 01:20:03.937
- What?
- Quite the war chest.

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:04.869
Well, can't we take it?

01:20:04.903 --> 01:20:06.387
That's out of the question.

01:20:06.422 --> 01:20:08.182
I'm afraid we'd never, we'd
never get it out in time.

01:20:08.217 --> 01:20:10.012
Presumably, that's why
they put it all down there

01:20:10.046 --> 01:20:11.289
in the first place.

01:20:11.323 --> 01:20:13.049
Best we can do is stop
the Germans using it.

01:20:13.084 --> 01:20:14.602
That's where Charlie comes in.

01:20:14.637 --> 01:20:16.121
They'll just dig it up again.

01:20:16.156 --> 01:20:17.605
Maybe. Maybe.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.331
It's a lot of manpower
and resources.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.508
This is our best
chance. 10 minutes?

01:20:23.542 --> 01:20:25.165
Not less by now.

01:20:25.199 --> 01:20:26.545
Right, we need to plan those
charges. Charlie, come on.

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.478
There's an emergency exit.

01:20:28.513 --> 01:20:30.101
Right, we'll take
that if we can.

01:20:30.135 --> 01:20:31.067
That's presuming that they've
come in from the front.

01:20:31.102 --> 01:20:33.138
No, those stairs won't
do you any favors.

01:20:33.173 --> 01:20:34.864
You need to stay there.

01:20:34.899 --> 01:20:36.452
Just stay here.

01:20:36.486 --> 01:20:38.454
You've got five minutes to try
and get her back on her feet.

01:20:38.488 --> 01:20:39.593
Okay?

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:40.905
Meet us at the stairwell.

01:20:47.394 --> 01:20:48.567
Banks.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.197
Poison?

01:20:57.231 --> 01:20:58.543
More like the jackpot

01:21:02.961 --> 01:21:04.445
Now we're talking.

01:21:27.986 --> 01:21:32.680
Don't mind if I
do sir.

01:21:34.648 --> 01:21:36.201
Keep it for now.

01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:57.602
Sorry.

01:21:59.328 --> 01:22:01.364
No, it's okay.

01:22:01.399 --> 01:22:04.333
No, I'm sorry for what I did.

01:22:04.367 --> 01:22:05.472
For what I said.

01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:09.717
I thought you, you were...

01:22:11.547 --> 01:22:13.376
One of them?

01:22:13.411 --> 01:22:14.584
I am.

01:22:14.619 --> 01:22:17.035
No, you are here,

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:18.519
you are, you are helping us.

01:22:18.554 --> 01:22:19.727
You didn't have to.

01:22:21.384 --> 01:22:24.180
Thank you.

01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:32.395
What? What did Paul say to
you to, to get you to leave?

01:22:37.642 --> 01:22:39.506
He said that you
would know what to do

01:22:40.507 --> 01:22:41.646
and that you would find a way.

01:22:46.444 --> 01:22:47.686
I failed.

01:22:49.447 --> 01:22:52.001
No, we're here, we're
making a difference.

01:22:54.383 --> 01:22:55.073
Okay.

01:22:57.179 --> 01:22:58.663
I've done what I
could. We gotta go.

01:23:21.755 --> 01:23:24.102
Back upstairs.
Quick as you can.

01:24:01.277 --> 01:24:02.589
Charlie.

01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:04.418
Banks? No, no.

01:24:05.523 --> 01:24:06.213
There's no time.

01:24:07.559 --> 01:24:09.492
Someone needs to stay here.

01:24:09.527 --> 01:24:10.838
Make sure this place goes up.

01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:13.496
Get the others. Get out of here.

01:24:14.704 --> 01:24:15.809
For King and country.

01:24:20.124 --> 01:24:21.332
Go.

01:24:21.366 --> 01:24:22.057
Go.

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.132
That's it. Come on.

01:24:29.133 --> 01:24:30.824
I know. I know, just lean on me.

01:24:30.858 --> 01:24:32.584
Let's go. Let's, go.

01:24:37.555 --> 01:24:38.556
They're here.

01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:39.384
Shut the door.

01:24:39.419 --> 01:24:40.661
Shut the door. Come on.

01:24:40.696 --> 01:24:41.800
Come on Ivy. Here.

01:24:41.835 --> 01:24:42.767
- Come on.
- No, stop.

01:24:42.801 --> 01:24:44.320
Come on. Don't do this.

01:24:44.355 --> 01:24:47.151
Don't do this now. Don't stop.

01:24:47.185 --> 01:24:49.429
- Just I'm not letting-
- Stop it.

01:24:54.503 --> 01:24:55.676
There's no time.

01:24:59.163 --> 01:25:00.681
Get out.

01:25:00.716 --> 01:25:02.511
Bring back enough explosives
to blow a hole in the world.

01:25:02.545 --> 01:25:03.857
You promise me.

01:25:05.755 --> 01:25:07.378
All right, promise.

01:25:09.621 --> 01:25:12.866
Hey, hey. It's for the pain.

01:26:26.974 --> 01:26:27.975
Go, go, go.

01:26:36.294 --> 01:26:38.193
We need to head back
the way we came.

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:47.374
Come on, come on, come on.

01:27:22.098 --> 01:27:22.961
Pop.

01:28:02.104 --> 01:28:03.001
Go, go.

01:28:25.783 --> 01:28:27.094
Here, here.

01:29:13.175 --> 01:29:14.072
Banks.

01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:18.836
Banks, Banks.

01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:22.978
Mm.

01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:34.921
Seemed a shame to
leave them all behind.

01:29:40.202 --> 01:29:43.516
Ssh! Look lively.

01:29:56.183 --> 01:29:57.668
Yeah.

01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:00.084
Saskia.

01:30:01.672 --> 01:30:02.569
Come on.

01:30:02.604 --> 01:30:04.468
There's transport coming for me.

01:30:04.502 --> 01:30:06.815
I think I can make the pickup.

01:30:06.849 --> 01:30:08.092
It'll be a bumpy ride.

01:30:09.127 --> 01:30:10.197
I'll cope.

01:30:51.963 --> 01:30:52.654
This is it.

01:30:53.724 --> 01:30:54.241
This is it.

01:31:04.286 --> 01:31:07.841
Take these, head to
the Swiss border.

01:31:07.876 --> 01:31:09.118
I can still fight.

01:31:09.153 --> 01:31:10.154
I know you can.
I know you can.

01:31:10.188 --> 01:31:11.535
But for now, just seek shelter.

01:31:11.569 --> 01:31:13.985
Regroup. The fight's
not over yet.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.504
When you get to the border.

01:31:15.539 --> 01:31:16.298
I don't have any papers.

01:31:16.332 --> 01:31:17.610
When you get to the border,

01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:19.163
just explain what
happened and tell them

01:31:19.197 --> 01:31:22.511
your commander in England was
Nichols, Air Marshall Nichols.

01:31:22.546 --> 01:31:23.892
Remember that.

01:31:23.926 --> 01:31:24.962
What if it doesn't work?

01:31:24.996 --> 01:31:25.790
It will, trust me.

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:30.588
Just remember
Nichols, me of course.

01:31:33.936 --> 01:31:34.454
I will.

01:31:53.784 --> 01:31:54.750
Be careful.

01:31:56.821 --> 01:31:57.891
I will.
