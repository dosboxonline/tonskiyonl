18:24.396 --> 18:26.356
in the field of identity metaphysics?

18:27.232 --> 18:28.233
Naturally.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.070
The Ship of Theseus
is an artifact in a museum.

Over time, its planks of wood rot
and are replaced with new planks.

18:37.659 --> 18:41.914

is it still the Ship of Theseus?

if those removed planks are restored

18:49.129 --> 18:51.381
is that the Ship of Theseus?
