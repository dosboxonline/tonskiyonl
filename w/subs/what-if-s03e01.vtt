00:13.416 --> 00:17.124
<i>Go-Avenger!
Heroes of the Gamma War!</i>

00:18.583 --> 00:21.081
<i>Long ago, there was an age of heroes,</i>

00:21.082 --> 00:24.581
<i>when the Avengers
kept the forces of darkness at bay.</i>

00:24.582 --> 00:29.039
<i>Until, consumed by his fury,
the Hulk unleashed terrors</i>

00:29.040 --> 00:31.498
<i>the likes of which
the world had never known.</i>

00:31.499 --> 00:33.748
<i>Their sole purpose?</i>

00:33.749 --> 00:35.458
<i>To destroy!</i>

00:36.666 --> 00:38.498
<i>In humanity's darkest hour,</i>

00:38.499 --> 00:43.208
<i>the Iron Man found inspiration in an idea.</i>

00:46.208 --> 00:48.248
No!

00:48.249 --> 00:51.373
Oh, come on, Avengers, don't fail me now.

00:51.374 --> 00:54.414
Mom! The Internet's not working!

00:54.415 --> 00:56.039
Didn't you reboot the modem?

00:56.040 --> 00:58.457
I'm trying to watch that old show.

01:00.791 --> 01:03.332
What? Mom, what's going on?

01:14.625 --> 01:15.625
<i>Time.</i>

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
<i>Space.</i>

01:21.708 --> 01:22.708
<i>Reality.</i>

01:25.750 --> 01:27.375
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

01:32.166 --> 01:36.916
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:39.250 --> 01:42.791
<i>where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:45.500 --> 01:48.500
<i>creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.</i>

01:52.333 --> 01:53.708
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:55.958 --> 01:59.125
<i>I am your guide
through these vast new realities.</i>

02:00.541 --> 02:04.166
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

02:07.750 --> 02:08.958
<i>"What if?"</i>

02:14.833 --> 02:17.666
<i>Big things have small beginnings.</i>

02:18.958 --> 02:21.833
<i>So let me take you back
to the dawn of the Gamma War,</i>

02:22.375 --> 02:25.539
<i>- which all began with a friendship.</i>
- Oh, God.

02:25.540 --> 02:26.873
Who likes doing this?

02:26.874 --> 02:28.956
On your left.

02:28.957 --> 02:31.624
Yep, you're good, buddy. Okay.

02:33.208 --> 02:36.039
Hey, you're doin' all right?
'Cause you're looking a little...

02:36.040 --> 02:37.581
Oh, wait, let me guess.

02:37.582 --> 02:39.581
Green?

02:39.582 --> 02:41.748
- Sam Wilson.
- Dr. Bruce Banner.

02:41.749 --> 02:43.914
- Yeah, I kinda put that together.
- Uh-huh?

02:43.915 --> 02:45.748
Looked like you were
really pushin' it out there.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.123
I mean, yeah.

02:47.124 --> 02:50.331
I--I read somewhere that cardio
is a good stress reliever.

02:50.332 --> 02:52.081
I've been trying everything lately.

02:52.082 --> 02:53.956
Yoga, knitting...

02:53.957 --> 02:55.539
...cooking shows. But I mean--

02:55.540 --> 02:57.414
You ever just try
talkin' to someone?

02:57.415 --> 02:58.498
Huh?

02:58.499 --> 03:01.206
<i>Sam Wilson sought to help
the brilliant doctor</i>

03:01.207 --> 03:04.373
<i>with a field of science
far different from his own.</i>

03:04.374 --> 03:07.206
The rage isn't even the worst part
when he takes over.

03:07.207 --> 03:08.414
<i>Therapy.</i>

03:08.415 --> 03:10.039
It's the fear.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.750
The fear I see in everyone else's eyes.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.206
And how does that make you feel?

03:15.207 --> 03:16.873
Lonely.

03:16.874 --> 03:18.581
Because if I'm being honest,

03:18.582 --> 03:22.125
I'm just as scared of myself
as they are of me.

03:22.708 --> 03:26.248
Well, look around you.
Ain't no one's afraid of you here, Bruce.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.539
<i>Sam Wilson knew
he had a responsibility</i>

03:28.540 --> 03:30.331
<i>to Banner as his counselor.</i>

03:30.332 --> 03:33.414
<i>But in that moment,
he saw a man struggling</i>

03:33.415 --> 03:37.208
<i>and felt he could do more to help him
as a friend.</i>

03:39.958 --> 03:43.248
I like this. This is a great boat, man.

03:43.249 --> 03:45.790
Throw me another brew, would ya?

03:47.375 --> 03:50.581
<i>But there are some forces
of nature that cannot be controlled.</i>

03:50.582 --> 03:53.040
Sam, come on!
Gotta secure the lines!

03:54.125 --> 03:55.957
- Tie that--
- Look out!

04:03.458 --> 04:04.500
Bruce.

04:11.708 --> 04:13.248
Bruce, no!

04:13.249 --> 04:15.706
Bruce, come on, man.

04:15.707 --> 04:16.873
It's me. It's Sam.

04:16.874 --> 04:19.748
<i>It turns out
there was still one side of Banner...</i>

04:19.749 --> 04:21.081
No, no, no, Bruce!

04:21.082 --> 04:23.248
<i>...he didn't want
his friend to see.</i>

04:23.249 --> 04:25.623
<i>So he took matters into his own hands.</i>

04:25.624 --> 04:27.789
Gamma put this monster in me,

04:27.790 --> 04:30.291
I've gotta believe it could take it out.

04:38.041 --> 04:40.914
<i>Unfortunately,
things didn't pan out</i>

04:40.915 --> 04:42.666
<i>the way Dr. Banner had planned.</i>

04:43.250 --> 04:46.664
<i>And in trying to expel the beast within,</i>

04:46.665 --> 04:49.290
<i>Bruce Banner created
a whole new monster...</i>

04:55.500 --> 04:57.290
<i>...and set it free.</i>

05:03.916 --> 05:07.331
<i>Forged in Gamma
and unrestrained by Banner's conscience,</i>

05:07.332 --> 05:09.998
<i>the threat grew in size and number</i>

05:09.999 --> 05:14.583
<i>as this Apex and his legions
rampaged across the globe.</i>

05:16.250 --> 05:18.665
- Look out!
- Pull up! Pull up!

05:23.916 --> 05:25.331
<i>With everything at stake,</i>

05:25.332 --> 05:28.833
<i>the Avengers realized
that to fight these bigger, meaner Hulks,</i>

05:29.500 --> 05:32.707
<i>they would need bigger,
meaner Hulk-Busters.</i>

05:45.583 --> 05:49.125
<i>And so,
Earth's mightiest heroes fought...</i>

05:49.791 --> 05:51.541
<i>and fell.</i>

05:55.541 --> 05:56.998
<i>And in their sacrifice,</i>

05:56.999 --> 06:00.666
<i>inspired the surviving heroes
to finish the fight.</i>

06:03.708 --> 06:06.791
<i>They chased the last of the monsters
to the end of the world.</i>

06:10.125 --> 06:12.333
<i>Until there was nothing left of them.</i>

06:15.125 --> 06:16.833
<i>Or so it was believed.</i>

06:18.500 --> 06:24.207
<i>Of course, issues left unresolved
rarely stay buried for long.</i>

06:31.708 --> 06:34.164
<i>This is
the worst-case scenario, folks.</i>

06:34.165 --> 06:35.623
At 1100 hours,

06:35.624 --> 06:39.664
Chicago and a dozen other major cities
were attacked by Gamma Beasts.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.123
And more are emerging every hour.

06:42.124 --> 06:43.206
Captain Rambeau?

06:43.207 --> 06:48.206
This could be a wave triple the size
of the one we faced in the old Gamma War.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.873
<i>Yeah. And that one took out
all the Avengers.</i>

06:50.874 --> 06:52.998
<i>So, if anyone ordered a death wish--</i>

06:52.999 --> 06:56.331
<i>Argh! These Gamma grunts try to set foot
in Mother Russia,</i>

06:56.332 --> 06:59.039
<i>but one face-off with the Red Guardian--</i>

06:59.040 --> 07:02.081
<i>Can you really call it a face-off</i>

07:02.082 --> 07:03.706
<i>when you just ran away?</i>

07:03.707 --> 07:05.789
<i>I was luring the beasts</i>

07:05.790 --> 07:07.706
<i>- away from civilians.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

07:07.707 --> 07:08.998
<i>- Like hero!</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:08.999 --> 07:11.206
<i>The point is,
there's more of them this time, okay?</i>

07:11.207 --> 07:13.456
<i>But where are these beasts
even coming from?</i>

07:13.457 --> 07:17.248
<i>Our satellites are picking up
a Gamma signature in the Arctic</i>

07:17.249 --> 07:21.373
<i>with the same isotopic fingerprint
as the original Apex beast.</i>

07:21.374 --> 07:22.998
We need to get Bruce Banner on this.

07:22.999 --> 07:24.248
No.

07:24.249 --> 07:26.373
Sore subject. Noted.

07:26.374 --> 07:28.706
- Sam--
- We know how to win this war.

07:28.707 --> 07:29.914
We've done it before.

07:29.915 --> 07:33.456
Monica and I will head to the Arctic
and cut this thing off at the knees.

07:33.457 --> 07:35.789
<i>Small note. I would go for head.</i>

07:35.790 --> 07:37.373
<i>Much more final.</i>

07:37.374 --> 07:40.206
Now, the rest of you,
focus on holding your territories.

07:40.207 --> 07:42.039
Barnes, you have the conn.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.458
Start prepping your mech, Rambeau.
We're wheels-up within the hour.

07:48.083 --> 07:52.748
Bucky, we won the last war
by the skin of our teeth.

07:52.749 --> 07:54.914
You do not get that lucky twice.

07:54.915 --> 07:56.748
You really think Banner's a better bet?

07:56.749 --> 07:59.956
I mean, this all started with him.
Maybe he can finish it.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.164
See what you can find.

08:01.165 --> 08:02.706
I saw on some cartoon

08:02.707 --> 08:05.708
he lives in a lair
in the center of an active volcano.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.250
Get to it.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.500
The show's pretty great.

08:13.333 --> 08:16.623
Cap, confirming the Gamma
signature. It's massive.

08:16.624 --> 08:17.957
Then I guess we're here.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.664
This place is a ghost town.

08:23.665 --> 08:26.250
The sensors say
the Gamma spike is right here.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.750
Monica, look out!

08:40.791 --> 08:42.706
I guess we just found the spike.

08:42.707 --> 08:44.875
Oh, yeah, you want some?

08:55.291 --> 08:56.789
I'm thinkin' big guns.

08:56.790 --> 08:59.166
Oh, yeah. I'm thinking very big guns.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.539
Whoa! What'd you just fire? A nuke?

09:16.540 --> 09:19.125
Well, that's not me.
Something else is happening.

09:25.375 --> 09:27.458
Monica, you seein' what I'm seein'?

09:27.958 --> 09:30.039
It's worse than we thought.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.957
There's thousands of them.

09:49.666 --> 09:50.791
The Apex.

09:53.708 --> 09:56.706
- They're listening to him.
- And awaiting orders.

09:56.707 --> 09:58.539
This isn't an infestation.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.707
It's an invasion.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.623
Bucky, you got news for me?

10:43.624 --> 10:46.208
<i>Officially,
Banner's location doesn't even exist.</i>

10:46.916 --> 10:48.164
<i>But I found it anyway.</i>

10:48.165 --> 10:50.248
- A black site?
<i>- Abandoned,</i>

10:50.249 --> 10:52.623
<i>but something there
must have caught his interest.</i>

10:52.624 --> 10:53.707
Mmm.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.291
Then, I guess I'm on deck.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.539
Sam?

11:00.540 --> 11:02.248
We gotta get ourselves back in the sky.

11:02.249 --> 11:05.289
So we can just get our asses handed to us
all over again?

11:05.290 --> 11:08.206
- Stop playing.
- You know who we need.

11:08.207 --> 11:09.581
Again with this.

11:09.582 --> 11:11.914
Look, he's the one
who got us into this mess.

11:11.915 --> 11:16.331
What I don't understand is why you seem
more scared of Bruce Banner

11:16.332 --> 11:18.833
than you are of those Gamma Beasts.

11:19.458 --> 11:22.123
There was a time
when he was your friend, Sam.

11:22.124 --> 11:24.831
And look how that turned out.
For everybody.

11:24.832 --> 11:27.414
You tried to help him. It didn't take.

11:27.415 --> 11:30.623
But now, like it or not,
the two of you talking

11:30.624 --> 11:34.208
is the only thing standing
between us and the end of the world.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.414
- I don't even know where he is.
- Hmm.

11:37.415 --> 11:40.375
Then it's a good thing I had Barnes
go behind your back to find out.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.039
You didn't.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.000
Oh, I did.

11:45.791 --> 11:48.498
<i>Coordinates will be loaded to your onboard AI.</i>

11:48.499 --> 11:50.748
<i>Just make sure
you don't come back without a souvenir.</i>

11:50.749 --> 11:52.707
Yeah, no promises.

12:22.875 --> 12:23.958
Bruce?

12:25.291 --> 12:27.456
Who were you expecting, Sam?

12:27.457 --> 12:28.916
A monster?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.164
Well, here we are.

12:35.165 --> 12:38.748
Bit of a fixer-upper, but I call it home.

12:38.749 --> 12:41.456
A nuclear combat bomber? Really?

12:41.457 --> 12:43.164
Yeah. I don't know.

12:43.165 --> 12:47.414
An abandoned government pet project
somehow felt like the right fit.

12:47.415 --> 12:48.581
Hmm.

12:48.582 --> 12:51.456
And the leftovers
made for a half-decent lab.

12:51.457 --> 12:52.708
Right.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.539
Uh, is that a nuke?

12:55.540 --> 12:58.039
Sam, it's inactive. Don't worry.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.791
Banner. Nukes. I love it.

13:02.375 --> 13:05.956
I'm gonna guess you didn't come
all this way for my little science fair.

13:05.957 --> 13:07.331
Yeah, I'm afraid not.

13:07.332 --> 13:11.498
What is it this time?
Aliens? Spooky wizards? Evil gods?

13:11.499 --> 13:14.081
- A new Apex has risen.
- What?

13:14.082 --> 13:15.664
Now, just hear me out--

13:15.665 --> 13:17.414
No, no, no.

13:17.415 --> 13:18.539
What do you mean, "No"?

13:18.540 --> 13:20.706
It's been years
since I've had an incident.

13:20.707 --> 13:22.456
I can't throw all that work away.

13:22.457 --> 13:25.248
The Apex's legions are thousands-strong.

13:25.249 --> 13:27.456
I don't know if we can take this guy down,

13:27.457 --> 13:31.125
not without a Gamma Beast of our own
in the fight.

13:33.541 --> 13:35.623
I--I can't do it, Sam.

13:35.624 --> 13:37.039
Not like that.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.664
Bruce, come on, man. We're talking
about the end of the world here.

13:40.665 --> 13:43.289
We need you.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.581
No, Sam.

13:44.582 --> 13:46.500
What you need is this.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.414
And what is this?

13:48.415 --> 13:51.123
It's a plug-in I wrote
for the mech's interface.

13:51.124 --> 13:52.624
What?

13:58.791 --> 14:01.081
I call it the Mighty Avenger Protocol.

14:01.082 --> 14:02.914
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

14:02.915 --> 14:05.916
Use it against the Apex
and you should have a fighting chance.

14:09.708 --> 14:10.998
So that's it, huh?

14:10.999 --> 14:13.248
The rest of the world gets to fight
your monsters

14:13.249 --> 14:15.498
while you just hide in fear?

14:15.499 --> 14:16.956
Fear?

14:16.957 --> 14:19.123
What do you know about fear, Sam?

14:19.124 --> 14:21.123
About being a threat.

14:21.124 --> 14:23.456
A living force of destruction.

14:23.457 --> 14:25.706
I know you can't get past the things
that scare you

14:25.707 --> 14:27.457
if you don't face them.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.665
Why do you think I built this protocol?

14:34.416 --> 14:37.206
You built it to use against yourself?

14:37.207 --> 14:42.500
I built it to protect everyone
from a monster no one can control.

14:49.916 --> 14:53.623
Look, I've never seen a monster
when I look at you, Bruce.

14:53.624 --> 14:55.416
I've only ever seen my friend.

14:56.375 --> 15:01.166
I guess I hoped if you faced this thing,
then maybe you'd see what I see, too.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.331
<i>Talk to me, Cap.</i>

15:17.332 --> 15:20.206
I think I've done enough talkin'
for one day. Thank you.

15:20.207 --> 15:22.498
<i>Then I take it Bruce isn't coming?</i>

15:22.499 --> 15:24.748
No. We're on our own.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.081
<i>Not entirely.</i>

15:26.082 --> 15:29.414
<i>The team and I are tracking the Apex
and his herd to New York.</i>

15:29.415 --> 15:31.498
They're gonna make landfall any minute.

15:31.499 --> 15:33.708
Banner did give me
something to work with.

15:37.791 --> 15:40.998
- "The Mighty Avenger Protocol"?
- Banner built this?

15:40.999 --> 15:42.831
Great, 'cause none
of his science experiments

15:42.832 --> 15:44.373
have ever gone sideways.

15:44.374 --> 15:47.039
A weapon this complex
has never been field-tested.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.498
How do we know he hasn't gone
full Colonel Kurtz in his volcano?

15:50.499 --> 15:53.581
Yeah, even if he hasn't,
if we run this op and we all go down,

15:53.582 --> 15:55.414
the world will be left defenseless.

15:55.415 --> 15:58.539
But this is the shot we have.
We may not get another one.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.289
Well, then we better take it soon.

16:00.290 --> 16:02.124
<i>Because the invasion has already begun.</i>

16:07.875 --> 16:09.124
Wait for me!

16:12.125 --> 16:14.706
We're out of time. We've gotta go.
We've got to go.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.791
<i>Roger that, Agent.
We'll take it from here.</i>

16:17.333 --> 16:20.164
- So many.
- <i>Everyone, spread out.</i>

16:20.165 --> 16:23.082
We need to hold them at the harbor
until Sam gets here.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.624
Take that!

16:30.500 --> 16:32.833
There's too many of them.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.458
Sam? We could sure use
that Hail Mary right about now.

16:37.125 --> 16:40.081
Actually, Rambeau,
this play is more of a blitz.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.664
Whoo-hoo!

16:41.665 --> 16:43.124
Yeah!

16:50.666 --> 16:52.414
On my mark.

16:52.415 --> 16:55.416
Avenger, assemble.

17:00.708 --> 17:05.914
Avengers!
If Colonel Dreykov could see us now.

17:05.915 --> 17:07.207
Mmm-hmm.

17:08.666 --> 17:11.039
Okay, Mr. Banner.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.248
Engines clocking at 1000%.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.666
Let's go.

17:15.916 --> 17:17.498
Incredible.

17:17.499 --> 17:20.039
All our operating systems are integrated.
This is great.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.458
All systems green, Cap.
Oh, we're good to go.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.331
Whoo-hoo!

17:25.332 --> 17:27.000
Not bad for a bucket of bolts.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.164
The whole world is watching, people.

17:30.165 --> 17:31.750
Let's finish it this time.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.664
Here they come.

17:48.665 --> 17:49.875
Fire at will.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.875
Take that!

17:52.458 --> 17:53.873
Oh, yeah, you want some?

17:53.874 --> 17:55.833
Yeah!

17:56.875 --> 17:59.998
Okay, Mighty Avenger!

17:59.999 --> 18:02.291
Yeah. Teamwork. Who knew?

18:05.875 --> 18:09.289
Oh. Banner made the interface
pretty user-friendly.

18:09.290 --> 18:10.415
I'll give him that.

18:12.958 --> 18:13.956
Second wave's comin'.

18:13.957 --> 18:16.165
Let's open up a six pack of whoop-ass.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.664
- Let's do this!
- Whoo!

18:20.665 --> 18:22.874
Oh, Banner, I love you, man!

18:32.333 --> 18:34.083
Anyone have eyes on the Apex?

18:34.625 --> 18:36.414
On our six.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.874
Don't give him time to think.
Let's take him out.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.539
- Hit him harder!
- Don't let up!

18:42.540 --> 18:44.456
Give it everything you got!

18:44.457 --> 18:46.998
Yeah, we're trying, Cap,
but it's not closing the deal.

18:46.999 --> 18:49.250
No, no, no!
His Gamma readings are spiking.

19:01.916 --> 19:06.914
Come on, people. We gotta get up.
We didn't come here to lose today.

19:06.915 --> 19:10.456
<i>Yeah, not gonna happen.
All systems critical.</i>

19:10.457 --> 19:13.039
Uh, Cap?
There's something in the sky.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.498
How's that possible?
We don't have any mechs left.

19:15.499 --> 19:18.831
No, it's not a mech. It's a...

19:18.832 --> 19:20.373
It's a...

19:20.374 --> 19:22.206
On your left, Cap.

19:22.207 --> 19:23.539
- Bruce?
- Hah!

19:23.540 --> 19:24.623
Yeah.

19:24.624 --> 19:27.539
Thought you might need something
that packed a bigger punch.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.748
So I gave the bomb an upgrade,

19:29.749 --> 19:31.956
- a fresh Gamma core.
- <i>What?</i>

19:31.957 --> 19:34.623
No. He can't release
all that energy over the city.

19:34.624 --> 19:37.539
He's not. He's going to take it all in.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.248
He's going Gamma critical.

19:39.249 --> 19:41.123
Whoa, whoa, that--that's too much power.

19:41.124 --> 19:42.789
He may never come back from it.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.081
Bruce, there are other ways.
You don't wanna do this.

19:45.082 --> 19:47.375
You know what's funny? I do.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.125
Bruce!

19:52.875 --> 19:54.498
It's okay, Sam.

19:54.499 --> 19:57.166
For the first time in a long time,

19:57.875 --> 20:00.124
I'm not afraid.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.165
Bruce! Oh, sh--

21:27.625 --> 21:30.956
It appears the smaller ones
are watching the fight.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.373
To see who comes out on top.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.998
That's why he nuked himself.

21:33.999 --> 21:36.915
Not just to kill the Apex, to replace him.

22:00.416 --> 22:01.791
We gotta give him a hand.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.583
Big guns, right?

23:07.250 --> 23:10.790
It looks like we have a new Apex.

23:16.416 --> 23:17.706
Mega-Hulk.

23:17.707 --> 23:19.166
Nope. No, thank you.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.748
Khonshu says light him up!

23:22.749 --> 23:25.914
Avenger Team, stand down! Stand down!

23:25.915 --> 23:30.248
Are you kidding me?
We've got a giant Mega-Hulk inbound.

23:30.249 --> 23:33.208
I said, stand down.

23:34.583 --> 23:38.123
- Cap, what are you doing?
- It's not Bruce in there.

23:38.124 --> 23:40.414
Sam! He's off his rocker.

23:40.415 --> 23:43.539
The man wants to have tea with Lenin.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.875
Sam, are you sure about this?

23:46.875 --> 23:49.373
It's like you said, Monica.
He and I talking

23:49.374 --> 23:52.624
is all that stands between us
and the end of the world.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.208
Hey!

24:00.333 --> 24:01.625
Hey!

24:02.416 --> 24:04.791
Over here! Bruce, come on!

24:08.416 --> 24:09.833
What do you say, Bruce?

24:10.875 --> 24:12.000
It's me, Sam.

24:24.166 --> 24:26.208
Oh, Bruce, come on, man.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.625
Hey, it's just us. Take it easy.

24:43.291 --> 24:46.958
I know you've always been scared
that everyone just sees you as a monster.

24:47.750 --> 24:52.000
But from where I'm standin',
all I see now is a friend.

24:52.666 --> 24:56.333
And I'd bet my life
that you still see one, too.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.750
Banner.

25:46.583 --> 25:50.083
I'm sorry, Sam. I know he was your friend.

25:51.166 --> 25:52.333
He still is.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.791
Big things have small beginnings.

26:04.291 --> 26:08.541
<i>Even the way a person sees themselves
can change their lives</i>

26:09.500 --> 26:12.333
<i>and the fate of the entire world.</i>

26:13.583 --> 26:16.164
<i>But in humanity's darkest hour,</i>

26:16.165 --> 26:18.831
<i>sometimes the greatest heroes</i>

26:18.832 --> 26:22.540
<i>are the friends who accept us
for who we really are.</i>
