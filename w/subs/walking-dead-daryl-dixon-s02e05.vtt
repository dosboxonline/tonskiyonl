Okay, next shot.

01:00:44.909 --> 01:00:46.576
Today is going to be
very challenging

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:48.012
because we have a lot
of special effects.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:49.947
We're literally tearing
zombies apart,

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.016
having the car covered in blood

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:54.919
as Daryl and Carol
effect their escape.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.486
Got any ideas?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:57.755
Not any good ones.

01:00:58.723 --> 01:01:00.357
Nicotero: The tranquilizer darts
are filled

01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:02.026
with this concoction.

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:03.828
Daryl knows what the result

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:06.230
of an injection
with this material is.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:09.133
So he's creating little
Tasmanian Devil zombies

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:14.438
so that these two particular
walkers can diminish the threat

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:17.541
by tearing any unsuspecting
walker in its vicinity

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:19.676
from limb to limb.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:29.053
McBride: I like the suspense
and the quiet calm.

01:01:30.755 --> 01:01:33.290
You're just wondering,
waiting for something to strike,

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:34.258
and you don't know
where it's going to happen.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.525
Man: One!

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:37.694
Two.

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:40.931
Three!

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:42.599
[Growling]

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:45.602
My favorite moment
from that day

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.304
was how much fun we had

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:48.739
with the amount
of dead bodies on the ground.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:51.241
She's not in the scene,
Norman. [Laughs]

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.445
I mean, there was, like,
hundreds of dead bodies,

01:01:55.612 --> 01:01:57.848
and it was super sticky,
super bloody.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.084
[Laughing]

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.452
And being inside this car
with the windows

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.388
and smashing up
against the windows

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.091
and everyone's panicking.
I was like, "Oh. You're back."

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:08.859
McBride:
You see Daryl and Carol

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:10.895
working together again
in tandem,

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:12.830
which is something
that I missed,

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.999
and I was really,
really happy to shoot that.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.600
[indistinct conversations]

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:18.869
Losang: Dixon is
faithful only to himself.

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:20.404
Man: Daryl wants to
save Laurent.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.172
You want to make him
a martyr.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.974
The Losang/Daryl opposition,

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.946
which we see playing out
starting in episode one, even,

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.281
is sort of these
two father figures

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.351
that represent different ways
of being

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:36.320
and different ways
of seeing the world.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.023
Daryl's influence on the boy
is not good for the Nest,

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:40.490
and it's not good
for what they believe

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.492
and what they want
the boy to become.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:46.296
And so Daryl's influence
on Laurent is dangerous to them.

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:54.738
♪

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.807
De la Fuente: I'm not
a martial arts practitioner.

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.843
And so, you know, I had done
all this preparation on my own

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:01.011
about other aspects, things from
the text and everything else.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:05.482
But the show got me in touch
with a man named Leo Tamaki,

01:03:05.649 --> 01:03:07.284
who is a very accomplished,

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:09.253
wonderful martial artist
and aikido master,

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.321
and then working
with Seb, the stunt coordinator,

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:13.023
and all the people
in his great department

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.892
and the amazing stunt double
I have.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:16.593
To their credit, they were like,
you know,

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.062
"We want you to do
as much of this as you can.

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.296
We think you can do it."

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:21.598
And so, you know,

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:25.769
I had this great opportunity
to do this huge fight.

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:27.905
Shooting the final fight scene
with Norman.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:29.406
One of the unusual things
about it

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:31.508
is we're shooting
so out of order.

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:33.911
So you have to prepare
yourself to die

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:36.680

going to finish the job.

There's an inevitability
to Losang's end,

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.861
and it's tragic because
he really does love the boy.

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:52.963
He really does have faith

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:56.733
that there is a higher purpose
to humanity,

01:03:57.334 --> 01:04:00.204
and that it's humanity's
job to follow that path.

01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:03.540

took the wrong path.
