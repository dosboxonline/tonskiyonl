WEBVTT

00:53.511 --> 00:54.721
Thomas, that's enough.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.142
Okay, man. No problem, man.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.611
You did great in there, buddy.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.196
You were very brave.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.531
Hey!

01:17.827 --> 01:21.998
Don't worry, little dude.
You're home, see? Safe and sound.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.292
Apples?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.588
Come on. Let's go take a look.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.171
Thank you.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.677
I'll take a witch hat.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.389
- Good choice.
- Thank you.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.018
Hey, you're one
of the new people, right?

03:05.685 --> 03:08.438
I heard you all lived out
on the wasteland, killing rotters.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.606
Yeah, I guess.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.067
Cool. So there's probably
nothing you're afraid of, huh?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.488
Come on, I'll show you
where all the good candy's at.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.115
And I'm Mei.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.241
Jude.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.367
Cool name.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.336
So, what do you think?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.923
Takes a minute
to get used to all this, you know?

03:35.298 --> 03:37.091
You know,
this place was up and running

03:37.175 --> 03:38.801
long before we ever got here.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.262
Maybe we don't have
to do anything to make it work.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.515
No, there's always something
you gotta do to make it work.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.726
Want another one?

03:50.563 --> 03:51.773
Oh, hello!

03:51.773 --> 03:53.191
Happy Halloween.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.527
And here's one for you,

03:56.653 --> 03:58.446
and one for you.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.329
And first place goes to,

04:06.704 --> 04:10.875
dressed as our
very own Mercer, Celeste!

04:16.297 --> 04:19.425
And this year's grand prize is

04:20.551 --> 04:23.137
ten lottery tickets!

04:27.517 --> 04:29.185
Let's take some pictures.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.021
Thank you all for coming out today.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.356
You all look fantastic,

04:33.356 --> 04:35.733
and I'm so happy
you're out here for Halloween.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.569
I always thought she was so classy.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.989
I never knew anything about her.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.699
Mmm.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.659
I used to read a lot of tabloids.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.121
Hey, you two look busy.

04:49.330 --> 04:52.959
Connie's a reporter for the paper,
and we've got a full day, so...

04:53.543 --> 04:54.669
How's work?

04:55.920 --> 04:57.505
It's nice to be reporting again,

04:58.047 --> 05:01.217
but Commonwealth news isn't exactly...

05:03.261 --> 05:04.304
hard-hitting.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.140
Have you met Pamela yet?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.645
I've interviewed her once
before the world fell.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.858
Yeah, and you also got her uncle
kicked out of Congress, so...

05:17.442 --> 05:18.526
That was you?

05:24.282 --> 05:25.325
We got to go.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.702
We have a lot to do
before the masquerade ball, so...

05:28.369 --> 05:30.496
See you later.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.089
You should ask her to dance.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.134
I gotta get to work.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.344
Okay. Catch up later?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.887
Yeah. See you later.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.404
Thanks for watching Coco.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.156
I'll come by tonight to pick her up?

06:05.156 --> 06:07.283
You know, why don't I just
keep her overnight?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.203
You're sure to be exhausted
after the late shift.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.372
You sure?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.915
Yeah, of course.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.502
Okay, cool. Thank you.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.879
I'll get her before your Bible studies.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.006
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.929
Thank you. Bye.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.146
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:37.230 --> 06:38.606
How's your place, get any better?

06:38.606 --> 06:41.442
Hell no. No, I think this place
is literally made out of paper.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.568
You sleeping?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.404
Nah, not at all.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.707
Can't wait till basic's over
and we get new apartments.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.001
Worrying about money again
is so weird.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.128
It's not forever.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.839
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

07:04.632 --> 07:07.176
Tide's turning
and Ezra's back in the game,

07:07.385 --> 07:09.053
just when we thought it was over.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.180
There is no telling how this ends.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.849
Ezekiel, come play.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.185
Nothing I'd love more, but I've got
to take care of these little guys.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.311
Us, too.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.355
Okay, okay,

07:19.439 --> 07:21.983
let's thank Ezekiel
for letting us use Shiva's collar.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.445
It's the cherry on top
of that sweet costume, right?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.366
I'm sorry, bud.
We've got to give it back.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.128
You know, Ezra,

07:44.172 --> 07:46.841
your dad saved this
from Hilltop when it burned,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.927
because he knew
how precious it was to me.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.972
But there's something actually more
precious, and that is your family.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.518
So this leash is yours,
on two conditions.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.646
One, that it always makes you
as happy as it made me,

08:01.105 --> 08:04.108
and two,
that you honor Shiva's memory,

08:04.901 --> 08:06.986
and always think of her
when you play with it.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.241
Go have fun, buddy.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.118
Ezekiel, are you sure?

08:14.243 --> 08:16.162
Yeah, just be careful. It's a chain.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.670
Who's hungry?

08:24.754 --> 08:25.755
Yeah...

08:30.718 --> 08:32.720
It looks like they had fun today.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.265
- Well, I think it was good for everybody.
- Yeah.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.476
How are you feeling?

08:38.476 --> 08:39.602
Also good.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.145
Excuse me.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.442
How was your doctor's appointment?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.568
Fine.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.239
No changes.
Have you heard from Maggie or Lydia?

08:52.198 --> 08:53.241
I'm sure they're okay.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.034
You?

08:55.576 --> 08:57.495
On a beautiful day like today?

08:58.371 --> 08:59.413
Never better.

09:15.471 --> 09:19.100
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
I'm such a klutz.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.717
Carol.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.804
What are you doing here?

09:58.681 --> 09:59.724
Sorry.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.018
I'm snooping.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.770
Well, I was worried about Ezekiel.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.154
What do you want to know?

10:13.821 --> 10:17.074
Well, I know that he needs surgery,

10:18.743 --> 10:20.328
and I know that he's in line.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.249
How long before
you get to number 147?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.675
Too long.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.221
Patients aren't aware
of their place in line,

10:39.305 --> 10:40.890
so can you do me a favor?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.391
Keep that to yourself.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.893
Mmm-hmm. Of course.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.189
Does Ezekiel know
how bad his chances are?

10:50.650 --> 10:56.113
He knows the odds aren't good,
but he doesn't know

10:56.197 --> 10:58.741
that there's likely no chance
he'll get the surgery unless,

10:58.741 --> 11:01.243
by some miracle,
he moves up the line.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.206
I'm sorry,
and I wish I could do more.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.339
<i>Welcome to the kill house.</i>

11:13.339 --> 11:16.467
In this exercise,
killing is not your primary goal.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.303
I'm looking for speed and teamwork.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.223
Two teams of two will start
the course simultaneously.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.142
One team goes through
the house on the right,

11:25.935 --> 11:28.062
the other team
takes the house on the left.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.272
There's one weapon,

11:31.023 --> 11:32.817
per team, that must be shared.

11:33.901 --> 11:34.944
Your objective,

11:34.944 --> 11:37.905
get through the house,
and all the rotters inside.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.450
There will be a rotter marked in red
at the end of each house.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.911
First team to take out their red

11:44.245 --> 11:46.455
gets one step closer
to earning their stripes.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.666
But fail to work as a unit,

11:50.209 --> 11:51.252
see what you get.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.964
Hart, you're with Thomas.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.341
Espinosa, Green.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.427
Quintana, Johnson.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.345
Dixon, Daniels.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.180
Team up.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.651
You mind if I go with Espinosa?
We make a good team.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.194
Did I ask for your opinion?

12:18.946 --> 12:20.489
Espinosa, Green,

12:21.240 --> 12:23.075
Dixon, Daniels,

12:23.993 --> 12:25.035
you're up first.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.664
We got this. I know you're
the fastest and I'm the baddest,

12:28.789 --> 12:30.666
- so we're good.
- Let's do this.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.877
Hey, I'm Jake.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.338
What's up, Jake?

13:04.408 --> 13:05.493
I got it!

13:17.588 --> 13:18.631
Clear.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.055
Move.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.851
Take it.

13:30.935 --> 13:31.977
Keep going!

13:43.531 --> 13:44.532
Help!

14:41.338 --> 14:42.381
Dixon!

14:43.799 --> 14:44.842
Dixon!

14:54.602 --> 14:55.644
Man, what was that?

14:56.312 --> 14:57.897
He was good. I was right there.

15:01.525 --> 15:04.361
I said speed and teamwork.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.198
Green, Espinosa, nicely done.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.492
Dixon...

15:12.369 --> 15:13.412
You're with me.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.678
<i>Looking up I see a new light...</i>

15:29.887 --> 15:32.056
You have to get this, it's so good.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.475
I don't have any money.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.436
Oh. Don't you get an allowance?

15:39.688 --> 15:42.149
Hey, who's your friend, Jude?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.276
Hi, Princess. This is Mei.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.403
Oh, I see Mei got the memo.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.738
I dig her already.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.615
You girls need any help?

15:49.615 --> 15:52.034
Um, I think I'm ready to check out.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.624
Oh! Rock on. Good taste.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.504
Well, pleasure doing business,
and come back any time, ladies.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.095
You didn't have to.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.180
It's a gift, for a friend.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.308
Can I have the receipt?

16:16.392 --> 16:17.893
Oh, don't worry about paying me back.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.812
I'd like it as a reminder.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.522
Of a good day.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.400
None of these
are going to work.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.527
- Are you serious? None of these?
- None of these.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.821
This is ridiculous.
Aren't you gonna...

16:28.821 --> 16:29.947
I'm not.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.407
I'm not angry. I'm just frustrated.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.741
I just don't know what she wants.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.703
She wants something worthy
of tonight's guests. That isn't it.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.705
We did the best we could
with the time we had.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.498
She knows you'll come through.

18:40.702 --> 18:41.787
Hi.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.500
Espinosa,
we don't need you for this.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.960
I volunteer.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.086
Give her a bag.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.548
I love volunteers.
Especially ones that look like that.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.883
Right here.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.270
All right. Let's see
what Santa brought me.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.067
This supposed to be funny?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.236
He gets the newest ones for his drills.

19:14.528 --> 19:18.031
Advanced military training, Mercer.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.744
- Advanced military training.
- It's fine.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.667
Hey! Careful with that one.

19:30.794 --> 19:31.795
This toothpick?

19:35.549 --> 19:36.758
It's not worth my time.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.236
- You got to swing all the way through.
- That thing is pathetic.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.863
Belongs on a wall.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.700
All right, release the rotters.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.202
With me.

20:10.334 --> 20:15.130
Two at a time, on my count.
Three, two, one.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.011
Why did you do that?

21:04.846 --> 21:05.889
Are you serious?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.475
This is the future soldier
of the Commonwealth?

21:31.248 --> 21:32.833
You shouldn't have intervened.

21:32.833 --> 21:33.917
He would've been fine.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.546
Did I fail another team-building exercise?

21:40.215 --> 21:42.384
You're used to handling things
on your own, I get that.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.261
But that's not
how it works around here.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.763
Sometimes we have to
set each other up to win.

21:47.931 --> 21:50.726
What does that have to do
with that little prick's ego?

21:51.310 --> 21:54.688
This place
is as good as anything I've seen.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.649
It'll give you a decent life
if you can cut it,

21:58.317 --> 21:59.735
and I want you to succeed.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.904
But you gotta get out
of your own damn way.

22:17.669 --> 22:18.920
Did you get lost out there?

22:20.964 --> 22:23.508
Sorry. There was
a long line at the kitchen.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.386
There you go.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.644
How was your day?

22:35.228 --> 22:36.897
- What?
- How was your day?

22:37.606 --> 22:38.648
It was great.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.233
I made a new friend.

22:42.110 --> 22:45.530
She got me a record.
You ever heard of Motorhead?

22:45.906 --> 22:48.075
That's good stuff. Come here, boy.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.287
No, hey!

22:52.371 --> 22:54.206
- Daryl?
- Yeah?

22:54.664 --> 22:56.166
Can I get an allowance?

22:59.086 --> 23:01.171
Can we wait a little while
until my job settles,

23:01.755 --> 23:03.590
then we can talk about it again?

23:04.424 --> 23:05.592
So we can stay?

23:05.592 --> 23:09.638
Do you want to stay, even after
Alexandria is all cleaned up?

23:10.263 --> 23:11.306
I do.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.391
Yeah?

23:14.601 --> 23:15.602
It's nice.

23:16.478 --> 23:21.274
I think as long as my mom knows
where to find us, I want to stay.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.865
Yeah, no. It's way too tight.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.162
All right, tell Max
we'll have something by tonight.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.564
How did you know?

24:01.648 --> 24:03.608
My mother always
taught me to be observant.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.155
So you found a way
to get outside the walls, huh?

24:08.864 --> 24:09.865
Mmm...

24:13.452 --> 24:14.494
What do you want from me?

24:16.037 --> 24:18.248
I have a friend who's waiting for surgery,

24:18.248 --> 24:20.625
and I need you to get him
to the front of the line.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.963
That's a big ask.
It's difficult stuff.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.631
Not for you.

24:29.843 --> 24:33.430
First things first, I need to make sure
this wine goes over well.

24:33.930 --> 24:34.973
Oh, it will.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.064
Mmm. I can almost taste it.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.443
It's a shame. My kids
don't even know what mango is.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.528
Well, maybe they'll have some one day.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.072
My kids?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.618
Not anytime soon.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.096
Thank you.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.023
Want some wine?

25:25.565 --> 25:27.651
I hear it's really good.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.277
Thank you.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.655
Cheers.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.537
What's wrong?

25:41.164 --> 25:42.207
Not really my scene.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.877
You know, I was cool being
on the other side of this.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.381
This is your world, not mine.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.010
Okay, just take it easy.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.556
If this is how the other half lives,
might as well enjoy it, right?

26:18.618 --> 26:20.287
Good to see you, sir.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.755
Wow. He hates you. That was a hate smile.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.474
Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!

26:49.774 --> 26:50.817
Hey, Mercer?

26:53.945 --> 26:55.405
I'm gonna need a translation.

26:55.405 --> 26:59.784
I just wanted to say hi.
You look very handsome tonight.

27:02.912 --> 27:03.955
It's not my thing.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.249
Oh, it is, trust me.

27:07.834 --> 27:08.877
You know, I...

27:10.128 --> 27:13.673
I hate these work events.
They're kind of boring.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.301
You want to make it more interesting?

27:17.052 --> 27:18.094
Join me?

27:18.845 --> 27:20.764
I would be honored.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.192
Name?

27:32.609 --> 27:33.652
She's with me.

27:35.904 --> 27:36.988
There's a dress code.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.095
Princess!

28:07.102 --> 28:09.979
Pamela. How do you like the wine?

28:10.438 --> 28:11.481
It's fine.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.985
If you'll excuse me, Lance,
I'm due for an interview.

28:17.821 --> 28:18.822
Oh.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.991
And we need to get a meeting on the
books about this Alexandria thing.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.326
I have questions.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.494
I have a pitch.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.121
I'm sure you do.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.544
Connie, so lovely to see you again.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.880
- Kelly, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.757
I hope you're enjoying the festivities.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.596
It's such an eventful day.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.559
But speaking on the record,

28:48.435 --> 28:51.354
do you celebrate every holiday
with such grandeur here?

28:52.522 --> 28:55.608
Traditions provide comfort
and structure in uncertain times,

28:55.692 --> 28:59.112
so, yes, we treasure our holidays here.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.656
But Halloween is extra special.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.118
You may remember from
my father's time in the White House

29:05.118 --> 29:06.578
that it was his favorite.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.414
He always loved
a good masquerade ball.

29:15.044 --> 29:19.966
What would your father say about
the class divide on display here?

29:21.050 --> 29:23.386
Well, we're lucky you found us.

29:23.678 --> 29:26.556
We appreciate and celebrate
every single person

29:26.681 --> 29:28.933
who contributes to our vibrant community.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.187
In fact, I wanna introduce you to someone.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.778
Carrie is last year's lottery winner.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.696
This is her first masquerade ball.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.823
If you'll excuse me.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.828
Excuse me, Pamela. I'm...

29:48.912 --> 29:52.165
Excuse me, I'm sorry, Miss Milton
has a very strict itinerary tonight.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.500
Thank you.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.676
That guy looks so familiar.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.262
Yeah, I kicked his ass in the train car.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.181
- Is that true?
- Uh-huh.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.642
Why is he serving food?

30:12.852 --> 30:14.103
(OVER MIC) Testing.

30:14.270 --> 30:17.315
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention for a moment, please?

30:18.483 --> 30:22.529
It is my honor tonight to introduce
someone who needs no introduction,

30:22.946 --> 30:26.199
our esteemed leader,
the Governor of the Commonwealth,

30:26.199 --> 30:27.450
Miss Pamela Milton.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.338
Thank you all
for coming out this evening.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.341
Tonight, I have the great pleasure

30:43.341 --> 30:46.719
of giving you a sneak peek
at something truly special.

30:53.017 --> 30:57.146
This is the work of the brilliant
Alexa Park, who is here tonight.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.941
Don't be shy, Alexa.

31:00.775 --> 31:04.821
It took Miss Park nine months
to lovingly create this painting.

31:05.071 --> 31:08.575
Like many of our citizens,
she sustained serious injuries

31:08.575 --> 31:11.995
out in the world before she found
sanctuary at the Commonwealth.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.999
Thanks to my father's sacrifices,
we are all here.

31:15.999 --> 31:19.002
Brick by brick and block by block,

31:19.669 --> 31:23.590
we are putting the world
back together the way it was.

31:24.841 --> 31:28.970
My father would be so proud to see
what the Commonwealth is today,

31:29.762 --> 31:34.017
how much this place protects
and cares for all its citizens.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.143
Bullshit!

31:35.810 --> 31:36.978
This is bullshit.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.981
- Sir, that's enough...
- Does anyone here really believe

31:40.106 --> 31:42.442
the Commonwealth cares
for all its citizens?

31:44.152 --> 31:45.612
Do you know who I am?

31:46.112 --> 31:47.572
Sir, this isn't the time.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.115
Please, you need to stop.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.368
Don't come any closer.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.788
I just want to talk.
Will you please just talk to me?

31:55.872 --> 31:58.583
I would have died for this place.
What's my name?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.460
I don't know, but I'd like to.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.837
Tyler Davis. I was a trooper.

32:02.921 --> 32:07.216
I tried and I tried to reach you.
One mistake and I lost everything.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.763
I came here to talk to you,
to make you listen.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.640
Tyler, I want to listen.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.309
- Let's talk, just the two of us.
- Don't lie!

32:16.309 --> 32:18.061
This is what you care about.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.690
Fancy parties and paintings.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.779
Not people like me.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.407
We're nothing to you, disposable.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.784
You're wrong, Tyler.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.622
I see you. I see you're hurting,
and I want to fix that,

32:37.830 --> 32:40.416
but first you have to promise
not to hurt anyone else.

32:41.042 --> 32:44.754
Please put down the knife
and let my assistant go.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.590
Her name is Max.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.304
I'm like you.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.306
I'm like you.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.433
I'm sorry.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.769
I'm so sorry.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.029
Max.

33:11.030 --> 33:14.617
- Did he hurt you?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.744
You're just going to stand there?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.288
Go after him!

33:24.252 --> 33:25.294
Get him.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.426
<i>South wing and roof, all clear.</i>

33:31.426 --> 33:33.136
<i>I need a status on Dixon.</i>

34:24.145 --> 34:25.438
You got nowhere to go.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.649
Are you taking me in?

34:28.816 --> 34:30.109
You gonna give me a choice?

34:37.200 --> 34:38.785
Shit, I didn't mean to...

34:40.078 --> 34:41.537
I just wanted to talk to her,

34:42.747 --> 34:44.248
to get her to understand.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.086
Now it's never gonna happen.

34:50.004 --> 34:52.173
Don't! Don't do that.

34:54.258 --> 34:57.720
I screwed up protocols,
with a prisoner. I got beat up,

34:58.638 --> 35:01.015
lost my apartment, my spending card.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.434
I have no way to help
my sister or her kids.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.355
You got a sister?
That means you got family.

35:08.314 --> 35:10.441
A lot of us don't get
to have that anymore.

35:11.984 --> 35:13.319
Don't take that away from her.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.404
That's not fair.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.668
Turn around.

35:36.717 --> 35:37.760
Let's go.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.477
You caught the bastard.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.606
Finally did something right.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.403
No. No, you caught him.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.031
Go ahead, take him to your mom.

36:44.493 --> 36:45.745
Well done, Sebastian.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.502
Remove him.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.005
You think getting rid of me
solves anything?

36:56.005 --> 36:57.840
There are thousands more like me.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.426
Resist the Commonwealth!

37:00.426 --> 37:04.138
Visibility for workers, equality for all.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.061
Are there thousands more?

37:10.394 --> 37:11.437
No.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.234
Make sure.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.973
Inside please, miss. Let's go.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.574
So how'd the wine go over?

38:06.033 --> 38:08.369
Great. It was a good first step.

38:09.912 --> 38:10.955
What's next?

38:12.081 --> 38:13.124
I'm glad you asked.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.460
Murphy, you're on the door.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.713
Cass, Lewis, split the wait staff.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.049
Figure out how he gained access.
Did he have help?

38:22.383 --> 38:23.426
I want answers.

38:24.593 --> 38:25.636
Espinosa.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.265
- Your friend on the wait staff...
- Yeah?

38:29.265 --> 38:30.391
See if she knows anything.

38:30.516 --> 38:31.559
Yes, sir.

38:35.187 --> 38:36.981
So did you work with him long?

38:37.523 --> 38:38.774
No, we never even met.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.444
Really? It's such a small crew in here.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.363
You think I'm lying?

38:45.156 --> 38:46.949
I'm just trying to figure out
what happened.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.745
I think it's pretty clear.
Didn't you hear what he said?

38:51.954 --> 38:53.414
Yeah, that there were others.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.458
What do you think he meant by that?

38:55.458 --> 38:56.667
No idea.

38:57.084 --> 38:59.170
But for what it's worth,
I believe him.

39:00.963 --> 39:03.257
This place is like a city from before.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.096
You remember.

39:10.639 --> 39:11.724
Yeah, I do.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.022
But you're doing this?

39:25.112 --> 39:26.489
So you don't know how he got in?

39:26.614 --> 39:27.656
Nope.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.158
Great.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.749
I wasn't expecting you.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.043
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

39:39.668 --> 39:40.711
Come in.

39:41.837 --> 39:42.880
Thanks.

39:49.595 --> 39:50.596
Oh.

39:53.766 --> 39:54.809
Vintage.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.062
Yes, I am a lady of high caliber.

40:00.815 --> 40:01.857
The highest.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.697
Wasn't that something today?

40:09.156 --> 40:10.449
Oh.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.412
They really know how to throw
a party around here, don't they?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.538
Kids had a blast.

40:18.707 --> 40:19.750
Yeah.

40:20.668 --> 40:21.752
He would've loved it.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.049
Yep.

40:32.096 --> 40:36.100
I know that this was
too painful before,

40:39.979 --> 40:41.689
but this belongs to you.

40:54.827 --> 40:57.037
- You should keep it.
- No, no, no.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.667
I want you to have it.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.180
This place can be a fresh start,

41:16.265 --> 41:17.600
if you want it to be.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.689
How are you, really?

41:25.566 --> 41:26.567
Just great.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.362
Still finding reasons to smile.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.329
Well, then...

41:47.922 --> 41:48.964
To fresh starts.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.559
- It's not bad.
- No.

42:00.643 --> 42:01.685
It's not bad at all.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.107
You always took the big glass.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.041
You look awesome.

42:25.334 --> 42:26.377
Thanks.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.755
And you look official.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.883
Yeah? You think so?

42:36.262 --> 42:37.263
Hmm.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.473
I don't feel official.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.268
Hey, I got you something.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.316
Yes!

42:52.152 --> 42:53.153
Hmm.

43:21.307 --> 43:23.767
<i>Sittin' down in a restaurant</i>

43:24.435 --> 43:26.937
<i>Tell the waiter just what you want</i>

43:27.187 --> 43:30.024
<i>Is that the meat you wanted to eat?</i>

43:31.275 --> 43:32.318
Clear!

43:33.861 --> 43:36.614
<i>Hash browns and bacon strips</i>

43:36.989 --> 43:39.700
<i>I love the way
that you lick your lips</i>

43:40.618 --> 43:43.203
<i>No fooling, I can see you drooling</i>

43:43.454 --> 43:45.831
<i>Feel the hunger grow</i>

43:49.710 --> 43:52.296
<i>Come on baby, eat the rich</i>

43:53.213 --> 43:55.716
<i>Put the bite on the son of a bitch</i>

43:56.133 --> 43:58.969
<i>Don't mess up,
don't you give me no switch</i>

43:59.219 --> 44:01.930
<i>Come on baby, and eat the rich</i>

44:02.514 --> 44:04.975
<i>Come on baby, and eat the rich</i>

44:05.559 --> 44:08.354
<i>Come on honey, here's your supper</i>

44:08.562 --> 44:11.440
<i>Come on baby, bite that sucker</i>

44:12.107 --> 44:14.485
<i>Come on baby, eat the rich</i>

44:15.235 --> 44:18.113
<i>Eat it baby, eat the rich</i>

44:18.530 --> 44:21.241
<i>Eat it baby, eat the rich</i>

44:21.325 --> 44:22.743
<i>Eat the rich</i>
