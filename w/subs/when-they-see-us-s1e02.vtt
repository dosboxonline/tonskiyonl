00:14.264 --> 00:16.558
<i>It's been six months</i>
<i>since the boys were arrested</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:17.892
<i>in the Central Park jogger case.</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:20.603
<i>Police believe the gang</i>
<i>confronted her here,</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:24.190
<i>then dragged her 200 feet into the woods,</i>
<i>where the assault took place.</i>

00:24.274 --> 00:27.569
<i>...a 28-year-old woman,</i>
<i>hitting her with fists and rocks.</i>

00:27.652 --> 00:29.779
<i>Four of them rape her</i>
<i>and leave her there, unconscious.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:32.073
<i>...suffered two</i>
<i>skull fractures, extreme blood loss,</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:33.199
<i>and hypothermia.</i>

00:33.283 --> 00:35.827
- <i>...pants were found near...</i>
- <i>She will not remember</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:37.787
<i>that she was viciously attacked</i>
<i>and raped...</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:40.081
<i>Doctors say the odds</i>
<i>the patient will recover</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:41.666
<i>are still stacked against her.</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.961
<i>"Details didn't matter</i>
<i>because there was no script.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.505
<i>They were coming downtown</i>
<i>from a world of crack,</i>

00:47.589 --> 00:51.342
<i>welfare, guns, knives, indifference,</i>
<i>and ignorance.</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:54.095
<i>They were coming from a land</i>
<i>of no fathers.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:56.723
<i>They were coming</i>
<i>from the wild province of the poor, </i>

00:56.806 --> 01:01.269
<i>and driven by a collective fury brimming</i>
<i>with the rippling energies of youth,</i>

01:01.352 --> 01:03.480
<i>their minds teeming</i>
<i>with the violent images</i>

01:03.563 --> 01:05.065
<i>of the streets in the movies.</i>

01:05.857 --> 01:07.317
<i>They had only one goal:</i>

01:07.859 --> 01:12.030
<i>to smash, hurt, rob, stomp, rape.</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:14.532
The enemies were rich."

01:16.117 --> 01:17.035
And then...

01:18.161 --> 01:19.996
I need another for emphasis.

01:22.665 --> 01:23.917
Their enemies were white.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.754
Go. <i>Daily News</i> has got a file
on these already. Gotta move.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.005
Go.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.841
<i>Some of the young men</i>
<i>who have been arrested in the attack,</i>

01:31.925 --> 01:34.260
<i>so young as to be children, really,</i>

01:34.344 --> 01:37.263
<i>told police they were just out "wilding,"</i>

01:37.347 --> 01:39.724
<i>and that's why so many people</i>
<i>are so amazed</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:42.143
<i>-at the tragedy of this occurrence.</i>

01:42.227 --> 01:44.312
<i>"Wilding." New York City police say</i>

01:44.395 --> 01:47.982
<i>that's new teenage slang</i>
<i>for rampaging in wolf packs,</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:50.235
<i>attacking people just for the fun of it.</i>

01:50.568 --> 01:52.695
<i>Today,</i>
<i>seven of those teenagers</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:54.823
<i>were arraigned on a long list of charges,</i>

01:54.906 --> 01:58.493
<i>including rape and attempted murder.</i>
<i>The case made headlines...</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:00.787
<i>Simple and solemn,</i>
<i>a makeshift memorial</i>

02:00.870 --> 02:03.206
<i>sits by the side of a road in Central...</i>

02:04.249 --> 02:07.460
<i>The victim,</i>
<i>a 28-year-old investment banker,</i>

02:07.544 --> 02:10.463
<i>is out of a coma,</i>
<i>but remains in serious...</i>

02:10.547 --> 02:12.674
<i>Some members</i>
<i>of the black community charge</i>

02:12.757 --> 02:15.844
<i>that the arrests are a racially motivated</i>
<i>rush to judgment.</i>

02:15.927 --> 02:17.679
<i>He's saying that this is racist.</i>

02:17.762 --> 02:20.223
<i>I'm saying, let them decide it</i>
<i>in the courtroom</i>
<i>before they come out to protest</i>
<i>on the sidewalks.</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:24.519
<i>And then what happened?</i>

02:24.602 --> 02:28.356
<i>Only two of the suspects,</i>
<i>Antron McCray and Yusef Salaam,</i>

02:28.439 --> 02:29.440
<i>have posted bail.</i>

02:29.524 --> 02:32.694
<i>The other suspects were denied bail today</i>
<i>at a raucous hearing</i>

02:32.777 --> 02:34.821
<i>that turned into a screaming match.</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:37.824
<i>Korey Wise,</i>
<i>the only 16-year-old of the pack,</i>

02:38.116 --> 02:40.201
<i>will stay in holding at Rikers Island.</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:47.917
<i>From atop Trump Tower,</i>
<i>New York's most flamboyant billionaire</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:50.378
<i>-looks out over Central Park...</i>
-And a pack of Newports.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.172
<i>...where police say</i>
<i>a pack of teenagers</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:54.257
<i>attacked a 28-year-old jogger. </i>

02:54.465 --> 02:56.968
<i>You better believe that I hate the people</i>

02:57.302 --> 03:00.054
<i>that took this girl</i>
<i>and raped her brutally.</i>

03:00.430 --> 03:01.514
<i>You better believe it.</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:03.349
<i>Trump put his money</i>
<i>where his mouth is</i>

03:03.433 --> 03:07.896
<i>by taking out this full-page ad</i>
<i>in four New York City newspapers.</i>

03:08.396 --> 03:09.772
<i>"Bring Back the Death Penalty."</i>

03:09.856 --> 03:12.525
<i>Trump spent $85,000 on the ad...</i>

03:26.289 --> 03:27.457
How you been, man?

03:32.754 --> 03:33.755
Holding it down.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.175
Hey, Korey.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.637
What's up, man?

03:41.554 --> 03:43.264
You ready for today?

03:47.352 --> 03:50.063
-What is it?
-Some pretrial...

03:50.438 --> 03:52.148
-something. I don't--
-All right.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.568
That's okay. I done that.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.365
Just a step to get you to the big trial.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.625
Y'all together in juvie?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.753
Uh-huh. Yeah.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.548
Um, but I'm out soon, so...

04:18.591 --> 04:19.884
My mom's...

04:21.010 --> 04:22.470
almost got the bail...

04:23.930 --> 04:25.598
the bail money from church, so...

04:30.019 --> 04:31.020
I wish I was, uh...

04:31.688 --> 04:33.356
I wish I was in there with y'all.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.151
When you turn 16?

04:38.444 --> 04:39.988
La... Last year.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.283
Last year.

04:52.917 --> 04:53.918
Where Kane?
Yusef...

04:57.463 --> 04:58.298
Um...

04:59.757 --> 05:01.259
he got... he got bailed out...

05:03.136 --> 05:04.345
a little while ago.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.183
You know what he told me, though?

05:09.767 --> 05:11.728
The only reason that you got...

05:13.146 --> 05:15.523
you got caught up in all of this...

05:19.319 --> 05:22.113
is 'cause you went down there
to the station with him.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.074
To help him out, man.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.076
To be there for him.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.330
He's my friend.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.875
Yeah.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.770
Thanks for all your help, Reverend.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.939
Yeah, thank you so much, truly.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.025
We wouldn't have made bail without you.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.985
My pleasure, honor, and duty.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.822
We put together a little fund
for all the families.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.493
There's a lot of folks
supporting these boys, know that.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.579
Yeah, well, we appreciate that, but...

06:12.747 --> 06:14.957
Yusef's case is not like the other boys.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.586
They talked themselves into they mess.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.339
That's not fair.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.555
"Fair"?

06:37.855 --> 06:39.774
Is there anything
you would like to say?

06:39.857 --> 06:41.692
Are you glad your son is home?

06:43.111 --> 06:45.279
Ms. Salaam,
are you worried about the verdict?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.824
Have you been in touch with the parents
of the other boys?

06:48.199 --> 06:50.993
Do you have any response to Donald Trump
calling for the death penalty

06:51.077 --> 06:52.078
for your son?

06:52.161 --> 06:54.497
No peace! No justice!

06:55.164 --> 06:56.249
What did you say?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.043
Donald Trump is calling
for the death penalty.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.294
Mr. Trump...

07:00.378 --> 07:02.004
...is a real estate hustler...

07:02.088 --> 07:05.216
What did she say?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.843
What did she say?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.108
You watch them grow.

07:25.069 --> 07:25.903
You know?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.450
And you start to think
you did a good job.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.202
You know?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.626
-Girl, no.
- Listen,

07:40.710 --> 07:43.921
if there was ever a time you gonna drink,
you need to drink now.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.884
<i>And I think sometimes a black may think</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:51.220
<i>that they don't really have the advantage</i>
<i>or this or that,</i>

07:51.304 --> 07:53.723
<i>but in actuality, today, currently,</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:55.975
<i>it's a great...</i>

07:56.309 --> 07:57.894
<i>I've said on occasion,</i>

07:58.227 --> 08:00.396
<i>even about myself,</i>
<i>if I were starting off today,</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:02.315
<i>I would love to be a well-educated black,</i>

08:02.398 --> 08:05.902
<i>because I really believe they do have</i>
<i>an actual advantage today.</i>

08:07.737 --> 08:08.905
What is a black?

08:09.113 --> 08:10.114
I don't know.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.493
But, hell, maybe he's right.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.703
Sometimes you gotta ask yourself,

08:16.954 --> 08:19.916
when is the white man gonna get a break
in this country?

08:22.043 --> 08:23.586
Girl, don't make me laugh.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.004
Huh!

08:25.671 --> 08:28.925
They need to keep that bigot
off TV is what they need to do.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.134
Don't worry about it.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.887
His 15 minutes almost up.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.605
They want to kill my son.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.776
That devil...

08:47.818 --> 08:49.070
That devil...

08:50.029 --> 08:51.822
wants to kill my son.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.535
You gonna take an ad out

08:56.369 --> 08:58.120
about killing my son.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.628
They gonna have to come for me first.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.175
Better yet, I'll come for him.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.887
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

09:22.937 --> 09:26.065
I think this will be what scholars call
"a piece of cake."

09:29.151 --> 09:30.361
Who are we dealing with?

09:31.153 --> 09:34.240
Robert Burns.
He's a divorce lawyer in Harlem.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.826
<i>And when I tell you</i>
<i>that's the full extent of his practice,</i>

09:36.909 --> 09:39.328
<i>-that's the full extent of his practice.</i>
- Yusef.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.997
-Hey.
- Hi.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.499
- Good to see you, sister.
- You too.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.917
It's gonna be okay.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.004
-You know I got your back, right?
-You always have.

09:48.504 --> 09:49.463
Always have.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.799
<i>Burns has no record of criminal law,</i>

09:51.882 --> 09:54.260
and he's representing Yusef Salaam
at the trial.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.263
Next, we have Mickey Joseph,

09:57.346 --> 10:00.057
<i>a criminal defense lawyer</i>
<i>for the Legal Aid Society.</i>

10:00.141 --> 10:01.767
<i>He'll defend Antron McCray.</i>

10:01.892 --> 10:03.728
- <i>I know him.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

10:04.520 --> 10:05.980
He's stronger than you think.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.984
-So, Mr. Joseph, what's gonna happen--
-Mickey, please.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.779
How would you feel if I called you
Mr. McCray? Like an old fogey, right?

10:14.572 --> 10:15.990
-Yeah, I guess.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.993
<i>For Korey Wise, there's some guy</i>
<i>he's got named Colin Moore.</i>

10:19.368 --> 10:22.371
<i>He's, I don't know, some kind of activist.</i>
<i>He's working pro bono.</i>

10:22.455 --> 10:25.708
I can't imagine how you feel
not having him by your side,

10:25.791 --> 10:28.836
but I'm going to use everything I know how
to get him back to you.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.965
You ever hear of this guy Peter Rivera?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.801
Uh, there was an ADA in the Bronx
named Peter Rivera.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.887
One and the same.
He's also a former cop,

10:37.970 --> 10:40.681
<i>and I have it on good authority</i>
<i>that he has political aspirations.</i>

10:40.765 --> 10:42.808
- <i>And who is he representing?</i>
- <i>Santana.</i>

10:44.727 --> 10:45.770
Mr. Rivera?

10:46.020 --> 10:47.480
- Mr. Santana.
-Nice to meet you.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.191
<i>The last guy they got repping</i>
<i>Kevin Richardson is Howard Diller.</i>

10:50.274 --> 10:52.401
You are such a good-looking family.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.279
Maybe we should get you out there more,

10:55.363 --> 10:57.698
show the public there's nothing
to worry about here.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.950
-Can I help you up the-- No? Okay.
-No, I'm fine.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.745
I found something on him we can use
if it comes to that.

11:03.996 --> 11:04.830
Like I said...

11:06.165 --> 11:07.124
piece of cake.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.542
Okay.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.214
So, you see a couple of bad suits
and cheap haircuts

11:13.297 --> 11:14.882
and you figure "game over"?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.760
Let me tell you what I see.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.346
Opportunity.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.934
This is an opportunity
for every one of those guys

11:25.893 --> 11:27.520
to make a name for themselves,

11:27.603 --> 11:30.272
to be the victor
in something high-profile for once,

11:30.356 --> 11:32.858
attention for once, respect for once.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.696
So, don't underestimate
how that drives a person.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.532
They are coming at it
with everything they got.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.119
Well, we are too.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.292
Okay, let's start
with the biggest challenge:

11:50.376 --> 11:53.379
the admissions of guilt that
the boys made in the police station.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.881
The judge ruled the confession tapes
are admissible.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.885
Now, we all know they should be
interpreted as coercion and thrown out.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.847
Unfortunately, that's not the case,
but there is some good news.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.183
The DNA evidence from the cervical swab
is inconclusive,

12:06.559 --> 12:09.353
which means that there wasn't enough semen
present in the victim to test

12:09.437 --> 12:11.605
and it cannot be matched
to anybody else.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.275
Reports are that the victim,
Patricia Meili,

12:14.817 --> 12:16.360
has no recollection of the incident.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.238
So, there's no reason for the prosecution
to call her as a witness.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.031
So, no physical evidence,

12:21.323 --> 12:22.324
no eyewitness.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.202
The people's case is weak.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.622
That's some chickenshit.
Like hers is the only one that's innocent.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.208
- I didn't say he was.
-You didn't have to, Miss Thing,

12:31.292 --> 12:32.960
'cause your shirt is saying it for you.

12:33.043 --> 12:37.840
They said they found that woman's hair
in Kevin's underpants.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.633
But of course we don't believe it.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.802
But how are they saying that?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.638
I mean, how are they gonna prove something
that didn't happen?

12:44.889 --> 12:47.641
And can they say it in the news
like it's real with no proof?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.351
I mean, I know they can, but...

12:50.102 --> 12:51.604
can we do something about it?

12:51.729 --> 12:56.066
They're saying they found hair
that looked like the victim's, ma'am.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.278
Hair analysis is notoriously unreliable.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.864
Hey, don't worry,
we're gonna get an expert

13:01.947 --> 13:03.991
to challenge the science for Kevin.

13:04.533 --> 13:08.496
Not only is there no physical evidence,
the confessions are riddled with conflict.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.456
A jury will see that.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.710
We'll show that your boys were coerced
by law enforcement.

13:15.586 --> 13:19.089
They will, 'cause my son, Ray,
he didn't even eat for a day and a half.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.633
You know, I went to work

13:21.008 --> 13:23.344
and I came back
and they were still going at him.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.303
Okay?

13:25.346 --> 13:26.388
And now, you know...

13:27.723 --> 13:30.226
Well, he's in there still
and I ain't even got money for bail

13:30.309 --> 13:31.852
-and I don't know how much--
- Ray.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.104
-It's fine.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

13:34.188 --> 13:37.483
- It's okay.
-They told us that Tron was coming home.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.069
And promises for cooperation are illegal.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.530
This whole thing is illegal.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.115
<i>That's when</i>
<i>we came towards the rape.</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:46.158
<i>Who is "we"?</i>

13:46.408 --> 13:47.910
- <i>Me...</i>

13:47.993 --> 13:49.662
- <i>And...</i>

13:49.787 --> 13:50.996
- <i>Yes.</i>

13:51.080 --> 13:53.040
<i>...ran in back of her</i>
<i>and she turned around...</i>

13:54.250 --> 13:57.127
Sounds like the damn
Emergency Broadcasting System.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.713
That's what it sounds like when you comply
with the Bruton rule

13:59.797 --> 14:01.090
during a five-defendant trial.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.801
So, we got the tapes in,
but we can't use them.

14:03.884 --> 14:07.012
Because they're all
implicating each other and not themselves.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.974
You know what we have to do here?

14:10.641 --> 14:12.226
We have to separate the trials.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.228
It tanks the gang narrative, though.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.106
Not five trials. Two, maybe three.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.400
We just have to find the right combination
of defendants

14:19.483 --> 14:21.527
that requires the least amount of editing
of the tapes.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.029
Good. Let's dig into it.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.407
They're not gonna separate themselves.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.202
We want a separate trial.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.413
Well...

14:34.290 --> 14:35.708
we all want separate trials.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.213
Look, if the jury sees
all five of those boys together,

14:41.297 --> 14:43.090
they're gonna think "wolf pack."

14:43.173 --> 14:44.091
It's no good. I agree.

14:44.174 --> 14:47.219
But the prosecution's never gonna agree
to five separate trials.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.555
Yusef never made a tape.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.432
He never signed a statement.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.561
I got him out of there before Fairstein
and those cops could trap him.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.272
So you're trying to say it's our fault
our boys are on tape?

14:58.355 --> 14:59.940
-I didn't say that.
-No, don't say that.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.526
-I didn't say that. I said...
- What you saying?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.653
...our situations differ.

15:05.237 --> 15:09.158
One thing we need to do more of
is control the narrative.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.619
People like Al Sharpton can help
with that.

15:11.952 --> 15:15.039
Oh, I don't know. I think it's a mistake
to make this about race.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.041
- Sweet Jesus.
- What? Why?

15:17.124 --> 15:18.417
Tell that to Trump.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.252
-Exactly.
- Rivera.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.630
Psst, Rivera,
you wanna just jump in there?

15:25.049 --> 15:27.843
The DA at some point
is gonna want to talk about a deal.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.639
I know you all want to believe
that your sons are innocent, but--

15:31.722 --> 15:33.098
- My--
- They <i>are!</i>

15:33.182 --> 15:34.892
We are innocent! We ain't touch that lady.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.518
We're innocent! We didn't do this!

15:36.602 --> 15:38.854
You need to understand,
all of you,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.773
that this case was assigned

15:40.856 --> 15:43.901
to Part 59
of the New York State Supreme Court.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.445
That's Galligan's court.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.614
Why is that a big deal?

15:49.114 --> 15:51.033
One, they didn't spin the wheel and...

15:52.952 --> 15:54.828
Wait, what...

15:55.955 --> 15:57.665
what type of law
did you say you practice?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.209
I'm a divorce attorney.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.212
I handled Sharonne's case.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.428
Judge assignments are supposed to happen
by spinning a wheel, so it's random.

16:11.845 --> 16:15.099
They didn't do that with this case.
They gave it to Galligan.

16:16.725 --> 16:17.685
Rikers Island,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.688
they call it Galligan's Island.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.817
Ten times out of nine,
he sides with the state.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.695
They don't plan to lose this case.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.988
Shit.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.534
-Can they do that?
- It's already done.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.121
But we're not.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.249
<i>We have useless tape,</i>

16:40.332 --> 16:41.959
we've lost our gang narrative,

16:42.209 --> 16:43.460
we can't find DNA.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.046
We have a sock.

16:48.298 --> 16:52.302
Those little bastards shot their wad
into a sock, thinking we wouldn't find it,

16:52.386 --> 16:53.303
but we found it.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.389
We have DNA. Good.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.183
The match will nail this thing down.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.893
How did the NYPD miss this?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.770
Who cares? We have it now.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.231
And the kicker is none of the defense
is aware yet.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.568
So, we can test it right before the trial.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.778
Surprise!

17:10.988 --> 17:11.947
Surprise.

17:12.823 --> 17:17.119
<i>...the accused</i>
<i>Harlem teenagers, most 14 or 15 years old.</i>

17:17.536 --> 17:21.290
<i>Initial reports suggested</i>
<i>they were quiet kids from stable homes,</i>

17:21.373 --> 17:23.417
<i>but neighbors now say some of the boys</i>

17:23.500 --> 17:25.210
<i>had been bad for a while.</i>

17:25.711 --> 17:29.214
<i>One of the boys, Kevin Richardson,</i>
<i>was an aspiring trumpet player.</i>

17:29.673 --> 17:31.550
<i>Another boy, Antron McCray,</i>

17:31.633 --> 17:34.762
<i>had dreams of becoming</i>
<i>a professional baseball player.</i>

17:34.845 --> 17:37.222
<i>-The trial will finally get underway...</i>
- Bobby, time to go home.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.099
-Go see that wife of yours.
- <i>...Yusef Salaam,</i>

17:39.183 --> 17:42.561
<i>-Raymond Santana, and Antron McCray.</i>
- Okay, Dave. See you tomorrow.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.730
<i>The jury selection</i>
<i>took an unusual length of time,</i>

17:44.813 --> 17:47.649
<i>as there were over 500 potential jurors.</i>

17:47.733 --> 17:50.360
<i>The violence</i>
<i>and quality of life in this city</i>

17:50.444 --> 17:52.404
<i>is getting worse and worse every day.</i>

18:11.799 --> 18:13.842
-Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

18:14.301 --> 18:17.179
-Hey. Everything okay?
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

18:17.721 --> 18:20.057
Just calling to let you know
I ain't gonna make it home tonight.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.518
Dave got caught up with some mess.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.146
So I'm gonna stay back
and work the double.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.690
Okay.

18:31.693 --> 18:35.405
-You sure there's nobody else who can--
- <i>No. I'm gonna stay and do it.</i>

18:36.698 --> 18:39.493
<i>Bobby, tomorrow's the first day of trial.</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:42.538
Ain't like we don't need
the extra money, right?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.459
All right, yeah.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.546
Okay.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.385
Yeah, look, I gotta get back to work now.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.011
I love you.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.015
<i>I love you too.</i>

19:02.224 --> 19:03.058
Bye.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.707
He's probably out there
with a cab for us.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.877
You know how he do sometimes.
I'll bet he's there at the gate.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.503
Just watch. I bet he's there.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.218
He ain't here.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.307
He coming with us?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.226
I don't know, baby. It's...

19:49.062 --> 19:51.607
There's a lot going on right now, okay?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.736
Everybody's just doing their best.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.697
Come on.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.954
<i>In one of the most anticipated</i>
<i>trials in New York State history,</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:08.665
<i>three of the attackers</i>
<i>from the Central Park jogger case</i>

20:08.749 --> 20:10.834
<i>go before a Manhattan jury today.</i>

20:10.918 --> 20:13.629
<i>Five teens are charged</i>
<i>with multiple criminal counts,</i>

20:13.712 --> 20:15.964
<i>including rape, sexual abuse, and assault.</i>

20:16.048 --> 20:18.717
<i>All eyes are on</i>
<i>District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer,</i>

20:18.800 --> 20:21.637
<i>who's representing the victim</i>
<i>in one of the most horrific crimes</i>

20:21.720 --> 20:22.804
<i>this city has seen.</i>

20:23.472 --> 20:25.933
- Ms. Lederer, a moment!
- Ms. Lederer!

20:26.141 --> 20:27.184
One question!

20:29.978 --> 20:34.441
Protect the black youth!
Protect the black youth!

20:34.733 --> 20:36.568
I'm here with Elombe and Nomsa Brath,

20:36.652 --> 20:39.363
two of Harlem's most prominent activists
and community leaders.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.074
We are here to assert the position
for the families

20:42.157 --> 20:43.575
and many in our community

20:43.659 --> 20:45.827
that there is injustice happening here.

20:47.412 --> 20:51.500
Injustice occurred in that precinct
when young boys, underage boys,

20:51.583 --> 20:53.502
were questioned without their parents,

20:54.836 --> 20:58.215
and were coerced by police and prosecutors

20:58.298 --> 21:01.426
to make false confessions,
leading to where we are today.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.930
We are here to point the finger
at the white press who have failed.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.558
You have failed
to properly investigate this.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.478
You have failed
to ask the right questions.

21:11.728 --> 21:15.274
How do you feel about people
calling your son a rapist?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.067
Why are you repeating this shit?

21:17.150 --> 21:19.987
You don't know how we are suffering.
My son is innocent.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.572
You don't know him.
Don't make presumptions about him.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.867
You've been spoon-fed a story
and you've eaten it up.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.412
-But we're not here for stories.
- That's right!

21:28.495 --> 21:30.497
- We're here for the facts.
- That's right!

21:30.580 --> 21:32.708
- For the truth.
- That's right!

21:33.250 --> 21:35.877
And the facts are
that these boys are not a wolf pack.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.798
They're not animals.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.343
They're not thugs.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.179
These boys, they are ours...

21:47.014 --> 21:48.598
and we will fight for them.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.236
Neat trick getting Galligan assigned.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.362
Real magical.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.115
And congratulations to you
on getting the trials separated.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.950
Oh, do we get credit for that?

22:07.075 --> 22:09.578
I'm sure it didn't have anything to do
with cutting those videos down

22:09.661 --> 22:11.747
into nothing more than a dog whistle,
right?

22:11.830 --> 22:13.332
We all knew you were the smart one.

22:14.791 --> 22:17.085
You've done well for yourself.
You're starting in the lead.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.755
Please...

22:21.048 --> 22:24.343
do those kids you're so eager
to put into jail a favor.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.803
Just give them a fair fight.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.890
From now on, just fight fair.
That's all we ask.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.230
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

23:22.567 --> 23:26.238
during this trial,
you will learn that the three defendants,

23:26.947 --> 23:28.115
Yusef Salaam,

23:28.365 --> 23:29.825
Antron McCray,

23:29.991 --> 23:31.868
and Raymond Santana,

23:32.953 --> 23:36.373
were among a group of 30 young men

23:36.665 --> 23:38.834
who went into Central Park

23:39.042 --> 23:43.713
to rob, beat,
and attack innocent New Yorkers.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.386
I want to highlight something
that Ms. Lederer did <i>not </i>say this morning.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.680
None of the victims,

23:52.222 --> 23:54.141
including Ms. Meili,

23:55.058 --> 23:57.227
has identified my client

23:57.811 --> 23:59.604
as a perpetrator in these crimes.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.358
These defendants are charged
with the rape,

24:04.317 --> 24:05.277
sodomy,

24:05.569 --> 24:06.903
attempted murder,

24:07.696 --> 24:08.697
assault,

24:08.780 --> 24:11.575
and sexual abuse of Patricia Meili.

24:12.826 --> 24:17.706
You will see video statements
from Antron McCray and Raymond Santana,

24:17.789 --> 24:21.293
where they describe in detail
how they participated

24:21.376 --> 24:23.420
in the rape and attempted murder
of Ms. Meili.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.671
And these tapes,

24:25.464 --> 24:28.008
these written testaments, these...

24:28.467 --> 24:31.303
are not as clean as the state
would have you believe.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.473
And you will find out
what went into making those tapes.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.142
These defendants told detectives

24:37.726 --> 24:39.936
that Kevin Richardson grabbed the jogger,

24:40.395 --> 24:42.522
and while Kevin and the jogger struggled,

24:42.814 --> 24:46.318
Yusef stepped up and hit her with a pipe.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.490
The police decided to solve this case,

24:51.823 --> 24:57.704
no matter what it meant to the rights
of a scared 14-year-old child.

24:58.121 --> 25:01.833
Carefully collected evidence
in a thorough investigation by NYPD

25:01.917 --> 25:05.378
will be presented to you
that will prove the guilt of this group

25:05.712 --> 25:07.172
beyond a reasonable doubt.

25:07.547 --> 25:11.218
During this NYPD investigation
that Ms. Lederer has described today,

25:11.301 --> 25:13.803
where they scoured Central Park

25:14.221 --> 25:15.972
for bodily fluids,

25:16.556 --> 25:19.267
for blood, for rocks, for a pipe,

25:19.518 --> 25:23.480
anything that might have
my client's fingerprints on it,

25:23.647 --> 25:26.858
and they did not find one.

25:28.818 --> 25:35.575
The only just verdict in this case
is a verdict of not guilty on all counts.

25:44.584 --> 25:45.418
Thank you.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.170
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:48.380 --> 25:51.258
the evidence in chief
against Raymond Santana

25:51.341 --> 25:52.759
is a statement he made.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.515
And I submit to you that
that statement was coerced.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.768
And after you hear it,

26:01.851 --> 26:05.647
I'm sure you'll see that
the people have failed to prove their case

26:06.231 --> 26:08.567
against my client, Mr. Santana.

26:10.026 --> 26:10.860
Thank you.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.029
Is he serious?

26:19.452 --> 26:20.453
Mr. Burns.

26:21.496 --> 26:22.831
Thank you, Your Honor.

26:24.040 --> 26:24.916
Uh...

26:25.834 --> 26:26.918
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:28.712 --> 26:29.713
the evidence...

26:31.631 --> 26:32.591
Uh...

26:33.174 --> 26:34.050
The evidence...

26:35.135 --> 26:36.636
is going to show that...

26:37.387 --> 26:39.889
until the body of the female jogger
was discovered,

26:41.016 --> 26:44.811
the crimes which had been committed
and reported to the police that night,

26:45.812 --> 26:50.358
they weren't treated with
the same degree of seriousness, of, uh...

26:51.109 --> 26:52.152
of intensity

26:52.736 --> 26:55.113
as the crime related to the white...

26:56.239 --> 26:57.449
female jogger.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.660
A lot of police became involved.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.704
Sergeants, captains.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.247
Brass.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.374
And on the sidelines, you had the media,

27:07.125 --> 27:10.128
which learned of the female rape victim

27:10.920 --> 27:14.507
and that the suspects
were all black or Hispanic.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.761
Conclusions were made.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.679
Quickly.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.514
And pursued in a vacuum.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.059
There was a...

27:24.976 --> 27:29.189
strong motivation to solve
and close this case as soon as possible.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.858
So, in comes my client, okay?

27:33.026 --> 27:35.320
Fifteen years old at the time.

27:35.570 --> 27:38.323
Never been in a precinct before
under any circumstances.

27:38.782 --> 27:39.949
And they work him.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.327
And work him.

27:43.203 --> 27:46.665
Until his mother comes down
and puts a stop to the interrogation.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.543
It was neither a voluntary statement
nor a truthful one.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.505
And the evidence to support it...

27:54.839 --> 27:55.882
it isn't there.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.386
Which leaves us room for...

28:00.428 --> 28:01.554
reasonable doubt.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.683
Thank you.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.065
Ms. Lederer, first witness.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.069
Oh, my God...

28:17.404 --> 28:20.115
She was critically ill
and just barely alive.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.787
What specific injuries did you discover,
Dr. Kurtz?

28:25.870 --> 28:28.373
Many. She was suffering
from severe hypothermia

28:28.456 --> 28:31.835
and she was bleeding actively
when she entered the emergency room.

28:32.585 --> 28:34.671
Bleeding from what part
of her body, Doctor?

28:34.754 --> 28:35.672
Her scalp.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.968
The blood was from scalp lacerations,
for the most part.

28:43.513 --> 28:47.350
Ms. Dean, what do you remember
about that night of April 19th, 1989?

28:47.475 --> 28:48.393
Um...

28:48.810 --> 28:50.729
I don't remember much, but I...

28:50.937 --> 28:53.231
I do remember a...

28:53.773 --> 28:56.109
group of boys.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.279
And they were making these...

28:59.863 --> 29:02.907
these animal sounds, like...

29:03.575 --> 29:05.034
-grunting--
-Objection.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.662
- Overruled.
- You were saying "grunting"?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.039
So, my fiancé and I were riding our bike

29:10.123 --> 29:14.419
and this entire group of kids
just started heckling us,

29:14.753 --> 29:16.296
and, I mean, I...

29:16.755 --> 29:18.548
We were completely terrified.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.551
Mr. Loughlin,

29:21.634 --> 29:25.221
you reviewed a lineup with the intention
of identifying your assailant.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.223
-Did you identify him?
-I did.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.977
<i>And that was number...</i>
<i>four in the lineup.</i>

29:31.060 --> 29:32.020
Is that correct?

29:32.145 --> 29:33.646
I believe that is correct.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.025
Is the person that you identified
in this courtroom today?

29:38.109 --> 29:38.943
No.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.696
Could you repeat that
a little louder?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.614
No.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.786
Thank you, Mr. Loughlin.
No more questions, Your Honor.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.918
I needed this DNA and the sock
to nail all this down.

29:55.001 --> 29:55.960
It doesn't match.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.171
So, five defendants, clean.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.715
Their DNA isn't there. It's not anywhere.

30:03.551 --> 30:07.180
So, there must have been another attacker.
One must have gotten away.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.224
You honestly believe that?

30:09.516 --> 30:12.352
I do if it helps a jury believe
what we know is true.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.729
Okay, but our case is built
on the assertion

30:14.813 --> 30:18.024
that <i>these </i>boys are the rapists,
not some sixth unknown boy.

30:19.150 --> 30:23.279
So, we have semen in a sock
and it isn't theirs, any of them.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.739
So, what are we doing here?

30:26.115 --> 30:28.201
I'm the one who has to sell this to a jury

30:28.284 --> 30:30.578
and the whole city is watching,
hell, the country.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.622
So, do you understand
what is happening here?

30:32.705 --> 30:34.749
We've still got the cervical DNA.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.167
Which was inconclusive.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.294
Which means the five can't be ruled out.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.965
Deal with the sock DNA results, you know,
play up the cervical DNA--

30:42.048 --> 30:45.093
Are you listening to yourself?
You sound delusional.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.012
You want me to pretend
that the sock never existed?

30:49.013 --> 30:50.515
This is crossing a line.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.560
What line, Elizabeth?

30:53.643 --> 30:56.479
Where's the <i>line </i>for Patricia, huh?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.566
I'm sick of this shit.
Where's the line for her?

31:00.316 --> 31:03.027
Left for dead in the cold
in a pool of her own blood,

31:03.111 --> 31:06.072
running out of her body minute by minute
in the fucking bushes.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.116
She feels herself draining away.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.618
-Where's the line?

31:11.119 --> 31:12.078
Huh?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.375
Fucking city!

31:17.750 --> 31:21.212
We hear something gruesome,
we grimace and we move on.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.505
Well, not this time.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.634
But these boys, Linda...

31:27.427 --> 31:30.597
They were in the park beating people up

31:30.680 --> 31:32.974
the same night that she's getting beat up

31:33.057 --> 31:35.226
and you're telling me
they had nothing to do with it?

31:35.727 --> 31:36.936
Bullshit.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.063
They said it themselves.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.982
They told <i>us </i>what happened.

31:41.608 --> 31:42.859
They were <i>told.</i>

31:44.360 --> 31:45.278
Come on.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.489
The eye sees, but it cannot see itself.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.577
They couldn't see the whole picture
of how their one part fit

31:52.660 --> 31:54.954
into the whole. That is all we did.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.048
It's too late for this.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.594
Like you said,
the whole country is watching.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.055
They are watching you.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.766
This is <i>your </i>opportunity.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.312
Remember her.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.571
The people call Patricia Meili.

32:38.748 --> 32:39.999
Oh, Lord...

32:51.511 --> 32:52.345
Oh, man...

33:05.858 --> 33:06.859
What are you doing?

33:08.736 --> 33:10.488
Praying she got her memory back.

33:24.627 --> 33:25.795
Ms. Meili,

33:26.212 --> 33:28.172
will you tell us what you remember

33:28.506 --> 33:30.591
about April 19th, 1989?

33:36.180 --> 33:39.434
I remember being at work.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.688
And we had a meeting at lunch

33:44.272 --> 33:45.690
with the entire

33:46.274 --> 33:48.443
<i>corporate finance department.</i>

33:49.152 --> 33:53.573
And I remember I had a phone call
at five o'clock

33:54.365 --> 33:56.743
to cancel a dinner with a friend.

33:58.619 --> 34:01.831
Do you recall what time
you left work on April 19th, 1989?

34:09.255 --> 34:10.339
No, I do not.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.885
Do you remember jogging in Central Park?

34:15.470 --> 34:16.345
No.

34:17.180 --> 34:20.099
Do you have any memory whatsoever

34:20.975 --> 34:22.977
about what happened to you in the park

34:23.728 --> 34:25.646
on April 19th, 1989?

34:37.033 --> 34:38.117
No, I do not.

35:01.390 --> 35:04.143
Ms. Meili, do you recognize
People's 33 in evidence?

35:05.436 --> 35:06.896
That's my shirt.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.899
Prior to April 19th, 1989,

35:10.066 --> 35:11.400
what color was this shirt?

35:12.527 --> 35:13.486
It was white.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.704
And do you recognize People's 13?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.581
Those are my running shoes.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.796
Ms. Meili, as you sit here today,

35:32.797 --> 35:35.466
do you suffer any lingering injuries
from your attack?

35:41.264 --> 35:42.932
A few. Um...

35:44.684 --> 35:47.270
I have trouble walking,

35:48.354 --> 35:49.522
as you could see.

35:51.399 --> 35:56.028
I have trouble with steps or stairs.

35:57.363 --> 35:58.364
I have...

35:59.198 --> 36:00.241
double vision.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.328
And I have lost my sense of smell.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.250
I can't smell anything.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.215
Nothing further, Your Honor.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.600
She didn't say it wasn't them.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.809
How you doing, boy? Looking good.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.103
You a'ight?

37:13.856 --> 37:14.815
I'm okay.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.363
Why aren't you home?

37:21.739 --> 37:23.366
Trial's almost half over, and...

37:23.824 --> 37:25.076
I ain't seen you once.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.078
I mean, uh...

37:27.787 --> 37:28.871
I'm just, you know...

37:29.789 --> 37:31.249
I'm working on some things.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.753
Taking care of some things for,
you know, for all of us.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.174
Trust me?

37:45.012 --> 37:45.846
Go on.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.980
Here's some money for the cab ride
back and forth.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.232
Wait... I thought...

37:59.151 --> 38:00.319
You're not coming, huh?

38:03.239 --> 38:04.198
Not today.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.080
I love you.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.507
We suggested,
myself and Detective Hildebrandt,

38:21.590 --> 38:22.925
that maybe the mother...

38:25.094 --> 38:27.221
It might be better off
if the mother could leave
and Mr. McCray could stay inside the room.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.518
And once Mrs. McCray left the room,
did Antron say anything?

38:32.601 --> 38:36.355
Yeah, he admitted about the female jogger,
about who was holding her down,

38:36.439 --> 38:39.025
and about him getting on top of her
and penetrating her.

38:40.693 --> 38:41.694
I never said that.

38:41.777 --> 38:44.071
And what was Antron's demeanor
at this point?

38:44.280 --> 38:45.364
His voice was low,

38:45.448 --> 38:48.367
he was fidgeting,
and, uh, his eyes were tearing up.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.161
He was crying.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.704
No, he wasn't crying.

38:51.954 --> 38:55.291
Your colleague Detective Gonzalez
testified that he <i>was</i> crying.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.084
I didn't see that.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.128
Hmm.

38:59.378 --> 39:02.006
You testified that it was
Linda McCray's idea

39:02.089 --> 39:03.841
to remove herself
from the interrogation room.

39:04.842 --> 39:05.676
That's right.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.428
But isn't it the fact that...

39:07.928 --> 39:09.055
that was your idea?

39:09.555 --> 39:10.973
Yours and Detective Gonzalez'?

39:12.475 --> 39:13.726
We all decided together.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.439
Detective Gonzalez testified
that Antron told him

39:18.522 --> 39:19.815
that he had penetrated the jogger,

39:19.899 --> 39:23.402
but you just told the DA that Antron
was very clear with you

39:23.486 --> 39:25.321
that he did not penetrate her.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.034
So, which is it, Detective? Because
both of you can't be telling the truth.

39:30.117 --> 39:32.161
-Objection, argumentative.
-He ain't did nothing!

39:32.244 --> 39:33.245
-Thank you.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.665
-Order! Order! Sustained.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.293
And because neither you
nor Detective Gonzalez

39:39.377 --> 39:40.920
kept any notes of the interview,

39:41.003 --> 39:43.923
I guess we'll just never know
why a 14-year-old

39:44.006 --> 39:47.176
went from saying that he had
never heard of a rape in the park

39:47.301 --> 39:49.470
to allegedly confessing to it.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.348
Is that a question?

39:52.431 --> 39:55.393
Isn't it true that you promised
Antron McCray that he could go home

39:55.476 --> 39:57.520
if he would just give you a statement?

39:57.603 --> 40:02.108
All we did was ask Mr. McCray
what happened, and he told us.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.735
But you have no notes of the many times
that he told you

40:04.819 --> 40:06.612
he had nothing to do with it.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.197
No.

40:09.281 --> 40:10.783
Just to be clear...

40:11.409 --> 40:14.912
he told you multiple times
that he didn't do it.

40:15.121 --> 40:15.955
He may have.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.416
- Multiple times?
-Multiple times.

40:18.749 --> 40:19.583
Yes.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.587
Mr. McCray <i>claimed </i>to be innocent.

40:26.882 --> 40:28.008
Thank you, Your Honor.

40:31.470 --> 40:34.557
Is it okay if I sit with Raymond
before they take him into Holding?

40:34.640 --> 40:35.474
Sure.

40:44.191 --> 40:47.862
A'ight, here's the plan:
you take out the guards, I steal us a car,

40:48.154 --> 40:50.156
we'd be in Mexico in a few days.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.991
I mean, you speak Spanish, right?

40:53.868 --> 40:55.161
I can say "tacos."

40:55.786 --> 40:56.745
That count?

41:04.837 --> 41:05.713
Man...

41:07.465 --> 41:09.341
I want to sleep in my own bed so bad.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.511
I want to go home.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.935
My dad don't even come to court no more.

41:22.771 --> 41:25.149
He say he knows what's gonna happen,
he's sorry.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.322
That's what everybody's saying, man.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.451
It ain't looking good for us.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.829
Don't think like that.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.792
If we don't believe, man, we already lost.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.966
And as for the cervical swab,

41:51.175 --> 41:53.469
the semen sample recovered from the body,

41:53.677 --> 41:56.013
were you able to recover a DNA sample?

41:56.680 --> 42:00.017
That's the pattern I informed
the district attorney was very faint.

42:00.226 --> 42:03.270
And based on your visual observation
of those two bands,

42:03.354 --> 42:07.233
would you agree that the DNA pattern
is different than that of Antron McCray's?

42:07.441 --> 42:08.275
Yes.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.280
And did you find any trace
of Antron McCray's DNA

42:13.364 --> 42:14.615
anywhere on the scene?

42:15.324 --> 42:18.827
No, but we only tested the cervical swab
and the sock.

42:40.599 --> 42:43.852
Agent, were you asked to test a sample

42:45.187 --> 42:46.939
on a sock recovered at the scene?

42:48.274 --> 42:49.108
Yes, sir.

42:51.151 --> 42:54.154
And what kind of sample was present?

42:54.947 --> 42:56.699
There was a semen on the sock.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.744
A semen, singular?

43:01.203 --> 43:02.037
Yes.

43:04.164 --> 43:06.709
And would you say that your findings
are conclusive?

43:07.084 --> 43:07.918
Yes.

43:12.631 --> 43:14.466
Based on your analysis of that sock,

43:15.426 --> 43:18.220
does the DNA present match that
of Antron McCray?

43:21.015 --> 43:23.100
-No. It was not his.

43:28.397 --> 43:32.901
Does the DNA from that sample match
<i>any </i>of the DNA patterns of the defendants?

43:39.158 --> 43:39.992
No.

43:41.368 --> 43:42.786
- I told you!

43:42.870 --> 43:45.205
- Order!
- They didn't touch her!

43:47.166 --> 43:48.042
Order!

43:51.920 --> 43:52.838
Order!

43:54.173 --> 43:55.174
Order!

44:01.221 --> 44:02.806
-Elizabeth.
-Michael.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.644
Did you call me here to apologize?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.270
Apologize for what?

44:08.646 --> 44:12.232
You saying that the DNA evidence
was inconclusive. That's not playing fair.

44:12.566 --> 44:13.400
Fair?

44:14.443 --> 44:16.737
-What's that word mean, anyway?

44:17.905 --> 44:19.948
I don't know,
something to do with justice, I think.

44:20.115 --> 44:22.159
It's no longer about justice, Counselor.

44:22.826 --> 44:23.911
It's about politics.

44:24.536 --> 44:26.747
And politics is about survival.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.500
And there's nothing fair about survival.
Survival at what cost?

44:35.923 --> 44:38.050
Those boys don't deserve
to pay the price--

44:38.133 --> 44:40.427
-I'm not interested in a philosophical--
-Then why am I here?

44:40.511 --> 44:42.388
I asked you here to talk about a deal.

44:46.850 --> 44:50.396
The prosecution has a huge problem
with its physical case, and they know it.

44:50.479 --> 44:53.399
It's the only reason they're willing
to talk about a plea deal, but...

44:54.233 --> 44:56.360
it has to be all three of you.

44:57.361 --> 45:00.364
If we all plead guilty now,
you will do time,

45:00.447 --> 45:03.659
but it is a fraction of the time you'll do
if we see this thing through to the end

45:03.742 --> 45:06.286
and it doesn't go our way.
It's something we have to consider.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.455
-This is good news.
- Wait.

45:09.707 --> 45:13.043
We gotta be careful.
It's all gonna come down to those tapes.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.088
If the tapes clearly show our boys
being coerced,

45:16.171 --> 45:17.923
it's a huge advantage to us.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.008
This case could still go either way.

45:43.031 --> 45:44.074
We didn't do this.

45:48.746 --> 45:49.663
No.

45:52.249 --> 45:55.294
I don't think we should admit to something
that we didn't do.

46:03.302 --> 46:04.303
Yusef is right.

46:15.522 --> 46:16.565
Not gonna do this.

46:20.027 --> 46:20.903
Okay.

46:21.820 --> 46:22.654
So...

46:24.531 --> 46:25.532
we keep fighting.

46:36.335 --> 46:39.755
When Raymond said "I was kneeling"
when he was feeling her breasts,

46:39.838 --> 46:42.591
did you look to see if there was any mud
on his pants?

46:43.634 --> 46:44.510
No.

46:45.511 --> 46:48.931
Did you make any notations
about there being mud on the pants?

46:49.932 --> 46:50.766
No.
Oh.

46:58.732 --> 46:59.733
One more thing.

47:01.151 --> 47:05.531
Raymond placed the rape in the wrong part
of the park. Am I correct?

47:05.823 --> 47:06.907
Objection, leading.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.158
You'll answer.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.163
Santana put the rape elsewhere.

47:13.747 --> 47:14.665
Where?

47:15.874 --> 47:18.710
Where "elsewhere," Detective?

47:20.212 --> 47:22.714
There's a lot at stake for this boy
and I want you to be specific.

47:22.798 --> 47:26.134
We don't need the commentary,
Mr. Rivera. You'll answer.

47:28.470 --> 47:30.264
He put the rape down there.

47:36.895 --> 47:37.771
Not...

47:40.399 --> 47:41.567
where it took place.

47:45.904 --> 47:46.864
No.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.369
No further questions, Your Honor.

47:58.333 --> 47:59.543
Glad you could join us.

48:06.717 --> 48:07.968
Ms. Lederer.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.263
The people rest, Your Honor.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.810
<i>She was raped and beaten so severely,</i>

48:16.894 --> 48:19.104
<i>she lost all memory of the attack.</i>

48:19.479 --> 48:21.315
<i>It's been a back-and-forth trial</i>

48:21.398 --> 48:24.234
<i>and so much is riding</i>
<i>on these taped statements.</i>

48:24.318 --> 48:27.070
<i>If what we're hearing is true</i>
<i>about those tapes,</i>

48:27.154 --> 48:29.823
<i>those boys will need a miracle</i>
<i>to convince a jury.</i>

48:59.394 --> 49:00.228
Hey.

49:04.399 --> 49:07.277
Protect black youth!
Protect black youth!

49:07.361 --> 49:11.698
Protect black youth!
Protect black youth! Protect black youth!

49:13.700 --> 49:15.827
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

49:19.122 --> 49:21.833
-No justice, no peace!
- We love you, Tron!

49:21.917 --> 49:23.961
No justice, no peace!

49:24.461 --> 49:26.129
No justice, no peace!

49:27.255 --> 49:29.257
No justice, no peace!

49:29.925 --> 49:32.219
No justice, no peace!

49:32.803 --> 49:34.972
No justice, no peace!

49:37.724 --> 49:39.142
They were framed!

49:39.226 --> 49:41.937
They were framed! They were framed!

49:42.104 --> 49:44.940
They were framed! They were framed!

49:45.023 --> 49:47.818
They were framed! They were framed!

50:09.047 --> 50:10.007
Hey.

50:15.220 --> 50:16.054
"Hey"?

50:19.266 --> 50:20.726
'Cause you didn't wanna show up!

50:22.310 --> 50:24.855
You didn't wanna show up
for half of my trial!

50:28.150 --> 50:30.318
Now you're trying to come here
and play the hero?

50:31.903 --> 50:33.155
I can make this right, Tron--

50:33.238 --> 50:35.115
Have you ever thought about
what would happen

50:35.198 --> 50:37.409
if you went up there
and say the wrong thing?

50:40.328 --> 50:41.538
This is my life.

50:43.665 --> 50:44.708
This is my life.

50:47.711 --> 50:48.962
I know what's happening.

50:49.838 --> 50:51.882
I know why you're leaving us.

50:54.843 --> 50:57.262
Ain't nobody ever blamed you
for any of this.

51:00.307 --> 51:01.433
I blame myself.

51:15.739 --> 51:18.533
Did there come a time
when you left the room with the police?

51:19.201 --> 51:21.078
Uh, yeah. Yes.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.954
And what did they say then?

51:24.706 --> 51:26.041
They said, um...

51:26.917 --> 51:30.003
if my son didn't cooperate
that he was going to go to jail,

51:30.462 --> 51:33.215
and then they said I should go back
in the room

51:34.382 --> 51:35.717
and talk to him alone,

51:37.177 --> 51:38.220
without my wife.

51:43.558 --> 51:45.268
And what did you say to Antron?

51:47.270 --> 51:49.981
I told him that I knew
he was telling the truth...

51:53.110 --> 51:55.153
but he gonna need to say
what they wanna hear

51:55.237 --> 51:57.656
so that we can get outta here
and go home.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.326
I was trying to protect him.

52:04.412 --> 52:05.372
Help him.

52:05.705 --> 52:06.957
Trying to save him.

52:07.916 --> 52:09.626
And what did Antron say?

52:13.755 --> 52:14.756
He said, "Dad,

52:15.841 --> 52:16.883
I wasn't there.

52:18.385 --> 52:19.511
I'm not gonna lie."

52:20.804 --> 52:22.347
What happened then, Mr. McCray?

52:25.600 --> 52:27.602
-I lost it.

52:28.895 --> 52:29.938
Threw a chair.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.026
I was trying to get him to lie.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.446
And then the police came back in the room
and I looked at my son,

52:38.738 --> 52:40.949
I told him to tell them
what they want to hear.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.451
I thought,
I'm trying to keep him out of jail.

52:43.535 --> 52:45.704
Know what I'm saying?
It's hard to come back from that. I--

52:45.912 --> 52:47.038
Thank you, Mr. McCray.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.167
No further questions, Your Honor.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.172
You threw a chair?

53:00.677 --> 53:02.262
Must have been pretty angry.

53:03.346 --> 53:04.306
Out of control.

53:04.389 --> 53:06.391
I was trying to get my son to lie.

53:06.474 --> 53:09.227
But when the taping began,
you didn't say anything like,

53:09.311 --> 53:12.689
"This is nonsense. I'm not gonna
let my kid answer these questions."

53:13.398 --> 53:14.566
They had told us

53:15.192 --> 53:16.610
if we cooperate,

53:17.485 --> 53:19.070
he would be a witness.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.489
They told us we could go home.

53:21.573 --> 53:23.825
Do you honestly expect us
to believe

53:23.909 --> 53:26.203
that after your son signed a statement

53:26.620 --> 53:28.830
admitting that he had beaten people
in a park,

53:28.914 --> 53:30.540
that he had been on top of a woman,

53:30.874 --> 53:33.668
that he had held her down
while people raped her,

53:35.378 --> 53:38.798
did you honestly believe that
he was gonna be allowed to go home?

53:41.509 --> 53:42.344
Yeah.

53:43.553 --> 53:44.554
Yes, I did.

53:46.014 --> 53:48.850
After we received that promise
from the police.

53:48.934 --> 53:51.061
Do you believe, Mr. McCray, that...

53:51.478 --> 53:54.147
it's okay to lie to protect your family?

53:55.982 --> 53:58.318
Is that something
that you would teach your son?

54:04.324 --> 54:05.158
Yeah.

54:07.869 --> 54:09.621
Look, he didn't do this.

54:09.704 --> 54:11.248
But you weren't in the park
on April 19th,

54:11.331 --> 54:12.707
so you have no way of knowing that.

54:12.791 --> 54:14.960
I know my son, all right?

54:16.169 --> 54:17.545
Antron ain't no liar.

54:17.754 --> 54:18.880
That's right.

54:19.005 --> 54:21.549
If he say he ain't touched that woman,
he ain't touched that woman.

54:21.633 --> 54:23.426
So we can trust his words?

54:25.136 --> 54:26.429
Yeah. Yes, you can.

54:26.888 --> 54:29.432
Well, fortunately, we have his words.

54:30.100 --> 54:30.934
On tape.

54:32.936 --> 54:34.312
Saying that he did.

54:42.112 --> 54:43.446
Nothing further, Your Honor.

54:49.244 --> 54:51.830
Thank you, Mr. Joseph.

54:55.792 --> 54:57.168
I know you did your best.

54:59.462 --> 55:01.172
This is not over yet, Antron.

55:08.221 --> 55:12.017
<i>There was no solid evidence</i>
<i>linking the defendants to the crime,</i>

55:12.100 --> 55:14.936
<i>no fingerprints, no blood matches.</i>

55:15.020 --> 55:18.898
<i>The prosecution's strongest weapon</i>
<i>will come from the teenagers themselves</i>

55:18.982 --> 55:21.234
<i>in written and taped confessions.</i>

55:21.318 --> 55:25.071
<i>Defense lawyers argued the teenagers</i>
<i>were pressured into confessing,</i>

55:25.155 --> 55:27.532
<i>that they were victims</i>
<i>of a biased legal system</i>

55:27.615 --> 55:30.243
<i>anxious to solve a crime</i>
<i>against a white woman.</i>

55:30.827 --> 55:32.370
<i>That debate could go on,</i>

55:32.454 --> 55:35.498
<i>as two other teenagers</i>
<i>also charged with the rape</i>

55:35.582 --> 55:37.000
<i>prepare for trial.</i>

55:37.083 --> 55:40.754
<i>So on the night of April 19th,</i>
<i>when you entered the park...</i>

55:42.547 --> 55:45.008
<i>did you see </i><i> hit her in the head?</i>

55:46.760 --> 55:47.594
<i>Nah.</i>

55:48.928 --> 55:50.138
<i>I heard it.</i>

55:52.098 --> 55:53.516
<i>Actually, uh...</i>

55:54.225 --> 55:55.143
<i>I, uh...</i>

55:55.810 --> 55:57.062
<i>I seen it.</i>

55:58.730 --> 56:01.566
<i>Who else had sex with her</i>
<i>besides Kevin Richardson?</i>

56:01.649 --> 56:02.525
<i>Uh...</i>

56:03.026 --> 56:05.070
<i>I didn't see anybody else on top, uh...</i>

56:06.196 --> 56:07.238
<i>have sex.</i>

56:11.785 --> 56:12.786
<i>Just him.</i>

56:14.704 --> 56:16.164
<i>Then you got on top of her?</i>

56:18.208 --> 56:19.918
<i>But my penis wasn't in her.</i>

56:20.210 --> 56:22.879
<i>I just... I got on top of her.</i>

56:23.671 --> 56:25.423
<i>For show. You know?</i>

56:25.840 --> 56:28.343
<i>And when he was on top of her</i>
<i>having sex,</i>

56:28.426 --> 56:31.179
<i>how were you able to put your hands</i>
<i>on her breasts?</i>

56:34.265 --> 56:35.350
<i>I was kneeling</i>

56:36.351 --> 56:37.310
<i>to...</i>

56:43.400 --> 56:45.276
<i>Me, Kevin,</i>

56:46.069 --> 56:47.362
<i>and...</i>
<i>I don't know the other ones.</i>

56:50.115 --> 56:54.202
<i>The only ones who did it different</i>
<i>was me and Yusef.</i>

56:54.911 --> 56:55.995
<i>Me and Yusef.</i>

56:56.663 --> 56:58.706
<i>Me and Yusef was just playing with her.</i>

56:59.999 --> 57:01.042
<i>I felt bad.</i>

57:01.835 --> 57:02.794
<i>I felt bad.</i>

57:04.462 --> 57:07.841
<i>This is my... This is my first extreme...</i>

57:08.216 --> 57:09.426
<i>I did to any...</i>

57:10.260 --> 57:12.095
<i>any kind of female.</i>

57:13.847 --> 57:14.681
<i>Or...</i>

57:17.642 --> 57:18.893
<i>This is my first rape.</i>

57:20.645 --> 57:23.314
<i>This is my first experience,</i>
<i>this will be my last.</i>

57:27.277 --> 57:28.987
<i>Were you trying to touch her?</i>

57:32.657 --> 57:34.451
<i>Not... Not really.</i>

57:34.784 --> 57:36.995
<i>Didn't you tell police</i>
<i>earlier today</i>

57:37.078 --> 57:38.288
<i>that you had tried to grab her</i>

57:38.371 --> 57:40.999
<i>-and that's when you got scratched?</i>
- <i>Um...</i>

57:41.875 --> 57:43.334
<i>No, no, not like...</i>

57:46.671 --> 57:48.506
<i>Like, not, like, feeling her up.</i>

57:49.757 --> 57:51.384
<i>Okay, not like that.</i>

57:51.509 --> 57:52.635
<i>No, like, um...</i>

57:53.887 --> 57:55.722
<i>I was trying to stop it.</i>

57:56.764 --> 57:58.308
<i>But you tried. You--</i>

57:58.391 --> 58:00.852
<i>Like, I tried to grab her arm.</i>

58:01.603 --> 58:04.647
- <i>You tried to grab her arms.</i>
- <i>Uh...</i>

58:05.607 --> 58:06.566
<i>I was, uh...</i>

58:07.066 --> 58:09.194
<i>I was trying to stop them.</i>

58:16.534 --> 58:19.621
And how many times<i> </i>did he slap you?

58:20.413 --> 58:21.873
Uh, three times.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.334
And what did you do?

58:25.835 --> 58:27.128
I just took him serious.

58:27.587 --> 58:29.839
I had no choice
but to take him serious 'cause...

58:30.131 --> 58:33.218
Hartigan said I could go home
if I said I was at the rape.

58:33.635 --> 58:36.054
You didn't want to say it,

58:36.846 --> 58:37.722
but you did.

58:39.974 --> 58:44.229
Why did you say something
that wasn't true, Korey?

58:45.855 --> 58:47.941
They said... They said if I was there,

58:49.567 --> 58:52.403
and if I went along with it,
that I could go home.

58:52.529 --> 58:53.780
And that's all I wanted.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.282
That's all I wanted, was to go home.

58:56.699 --> 58:58.034
That's all I still want.

59:02.455 --> 59:04.207
No further questions, Your Honor.

59:06.584 --> 59:08.836
So that punching gesture
that you're making in the video,

59:09.295 --> 59:12.423
right, demonstrating how the boys
punched the jogger,

59:12.507 --> 59:14.801
did the police make you do that on tape?

59:15.301 --> 59:17.220
Punching with both your fists?

59:20.223 --> 59:21.516
Somehow.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.811
They tell you that you were supposed
to do that?

59:25.937 --> 59:27.772
W... They was yelling at me.

59:27.855 --> 59:31.192
They was screaming at me
and hitting on me, so I...

59:31.734 --> 59:33.778
I figured I'd tell them what they wanted.

59:33.861 --> 59:37.323
If I tell them what they wanted,
I could go home. So that's what I did.

59:37.865 --> 59:40.076
In your statement,
did the police make you say

59:40.159 --> 59:42.287
that you hit her in the head with a pipe?

59:43.871 --> 59:45.540
Is that... That's what it says?

59:46.624 --> 59:48.835
Is that your signature on the page?

59:49.043 --> 59:51.504
Permission to approach the witness,
Your Honor?

59:51.588 --> 59:53.715
Is that your signature on your page?

59:57.051 --> 59:58.553
Yeah. Yeah.

59:58.636 --> 1:00:01.222
And above that,
what does the statement say?

1:00:05.852 --> 1:00:06.853
Read the statement.

1:00:08.521 --> 1:00:09.814
What does the statement say?

1:00:10.648 --> 1:00:12.609
-Read what the sentence says.
<i>-</i>I can't read well.

1:00:12.692 --> 1:00:14.861
-I can't read very well.
-Can you try to read it?

1:00:15.111 --> 1:00:18.573
-I said I can't read very well.
-Just read what the sentence says.

1:00:18.656 --> 1:00:21.284
What's wrong with this woman? I said
I can't read well. She pushing on me.

1:00:21.367 --> 1:00:23.411
Can you read any of the words?

1:00:24.245 --> 1:00:25.455
Uh, maybe.

1:00:26.623 --> 1:00:28.207
Maybe. I don't know. I can't--

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:31.586
Above your name,
does it say, "This statement is true"?

1:00:31.753 --> 1:00:33.671
I don't know what it says
'cause I ain't write it.

1:00:33.755 --> 1:00:36.090
So I don't know what it says.
I ain't write it.

1:00:37.008 --> 1:00:38.176
Did you skip school

1:00:39.135 --> 1:00:40.762
on April 19th, 1989?

1:00:42.764 --> 1:00:44.849
-Yeah.
- And isn't it true that

1:00:44.932 --> 1:00:48.895
you were truant from school
before this date, April 19th, 1989?

1:00:49.687 --> 1:00:50.563
"Truant"?

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:52.148
That means you skipped school.

1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:55.276
-I had a reason.
- You skipped a lot of school?

1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:56.319
Objection.

1:00:56.611 --> 1:00:57.612
Asked and answered.

1:00:57.945 --> 1:00:59.822
Overruled. You can answer.

1:00:59.906 --> 1:01:02.200
I had a reason.
I was threatened in school.

1:01:02.283 --> 1:01:03.368
That's why.

1:01:03.951 --> 1:01:05.995
What's that...
What's that have to do my case?

1:01:06.079 --> 1:01:11.167
And is that the reason that
you skipped school for <i>all </i>of April 1989?

1:01:11.626 --> 1:01:13.419
What does that
have to do with my case?

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:15.171
You're here to answer questions.

1:01:15.421 --> 1:01:16.964
I don't want to answer
her questions anymore,

1:01:17.048 --> 1:01:19.884
answering a question's what
got me here in the first place. So I...

1:01:19.967 --> 1:01:22.178
-I don't want to answer her questions.
-Answer the question.

1:01:22.261 --> 1:01:23.596
-Why I gotta answer?

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:26.015
- He already answered!
-What does that have to do with my case?

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:27.809
- Get them out of here!

1:01:27.892 --> 1:01:29.894
What does that have to do with my case?

1:02:09.809 --> 1:02:12.145
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...</i>

1:02:13.438 --> 1:02:14.313
<i>these boys...</i>

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:20.069
they had their fun in Central Park
on April 19th, 1989.

1:02:20.153 --> 1:02:22.947
Today, they have no one to blame
but themselves.

1:02:25.950 --> 1:02:30.329
They were acting in concert
with one another and others in the park.

1:02:31.038 --> 1:02:34.459
They committed the vicious attack
on Patricia Meili

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:38.171
and the brutal beating
of Loughlin and Lewis.

1:02:41.883 --> 1:02:45.553
Not one person
has walked into this courtroom

1:02:45.762 --> 1:02:48.973
and said that Antron McCray
attacked Patricia Meili.

1:02:50.516 --> 1:02:52.101
Or anyone, for that matter.

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:57.857
There is not one shred of physical
or scientific evidence that proves

1:02:57.940 --> 1:03:01.360
that Antron McCray committed these crimes
or any crimes whatsoever.

1:03:01.652 --> 1:03:03.321
All the police had to do

1:03:04.071 --> 1:03:06.657
was make one and one equal two.

1:03:07.784 --> 1:03:09.660
So detectives, they start talking,

1:03:10.161 --> 1:03:11.370
asking questions.

1:03:12.288 --> 1:03:13.247
To kids.

1:03:14.290 --> 1:03:15.708
Who have not had any food,

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:18.085
who've not been allowed to sleep.

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:21.130
And they questioned them for hours

1:03:21.714 --> 1:03:22.840
and hours

1:03:23.174 --> 1:03:24.133
and hours.

1:03:24.217 --> 1:03:25.802
Then even more hours.

1:03:26.010 --> 1:03:30.348
You seemed to have a hard time
watching the confession tapes.

1:03:30.765 --> 1:03:33.768
But if you watch closely
and watch for yourself,
you will see the truth, and you did.

1:03:39.148 --> 1:03:40.441
The evidence...

1:03:41.025 --> 1:03:42.193
is so conflicting.

1:03:43.319 --> 1:03:45.863
Emotions have run so high.

1:03:46.405 --> 1:03:47.281
And...

1:03:47.865 --> 1:03:49.784
there are racial overtones

1:03:50.201 --> 1:03:53.204
that even the blind Lady Justice can see.

1:03:54.163 --> 1:03:58.292
Acting with an entire group
of more than 30 people,

1:03:59.544 --> 1:04:01.254
they went wild in the park,

1:04:01.879 --> 1:04:03.172
beating, kicking,

1:04:03.631 --> 1:04:05.091
using bricks and stones,

1:04:05.174 --> 1:04:06.843
striking anybody they could find.

1:04:06.926 --> 1:04:10.680
They admitted all of this in their written
and taped statements to police.

1:04:10.763 --> 1:04:13.474
You saw Patricia Meili's shirt
soaked in blood,

1:04:13.558 --> 1:04:18.145
but there is not one drop of blood
on Antron's clothes, not one drop.

1:04:18.229 --> 1:04:19.063
Why?

1:04:19.397 --> 1:04:22.650
Because Antron is innocent
of these crimes.

1:04:22.859 --> 1:04:25.611
Why was there no blood
on the defendant's clothing?

1:04:25.903 --> 1:04:29.407
Because Patricia lost most of her blood
from head wounds.

1:04:29.657 --> 1:04:31.826
They didn't come in contact
with her head.

1:04:31.951 --> 1:04:35.162
They were on top of her pelvic area
and her torso.

1:04:35.246 --> 1:04:40.251
Imagine the frenzy of these teenagers
as they were gathering around her,

1:04:40.501 --> 1:04:44.171
reaching hands to grab her,
ripping off her clothes.

1:04:44.255 --> 1:04:47.300
In the chaos, are you surprised
that the defendants,

1:04:47.383 --> 1:04:51.095
when they were questioned,
don't remember the exact details?

1:04:51.846 --> 1:04:55.266
And just because there is DNA evidence

1:04:55.641 --> 1:04:57.894
that someone else was present
at the scene,

1:04:57.977 --> 1:05:01.522
that doesn't mean that these defendants
are innocent.

1:05:02.023 --> 1:05:05.526
They can still be guilty of rape
under the law.

1:05:05.735 --> 1:05:07.278
If they were present,

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:10.072
if they did nothing to stop her agony,

1:05:10.156 --> 1:05:11.449
then they are guilty.

1:05:31.802 --> 1:05:33.429
<i>You watch them grow.</i>

1:05:40.186 --> 1:05:42.563
<i>And you start to think</i>
<i>you did a good job.</i>

1:05:51.656 --> 1:05:52.823
<i>And then one night...</i>

1:05:56.494 --> 1:05:57.536
<i>you look away.</i>

1:06:11.717 --> 1:06:12.718
<i>One night.</i>

1:06:24.021 --> 1:06:25.272
<i>Kevin Richardson...</i>

1:06:26.315 --> 1:06:27.274
please stand.

1:06:29.026 --> 1:06:31.237
Antron McCray, please stand.

1:06:33.114 --> 1:06:35.658
Yusef Salaam, please stand.

1:06:36.409 --> 1:06:39.078
Raymond Santana, Jr., please stand.

1:06:40.162 --> 1:06:42.206
Korey Wise, please stand.

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:46.002
In the matter of the <i>State of New York...</i>

1:06:46.460 --> 1:06:49.171
as to the count of rape
in the first degree...

1:06:51.090 --> 1:06:53.718
As to the count of assault
in the first degree...
As to the count of assault
in the second degree...

1:06:57.805 --> 1:07:00.099
As to the count of riot
in the first degree...

1:07:00.182 --> 1:07:01.809
As to the count of rape
in the first degree...

1:07:01.892 --> 1:07:03.978
Count of robbery...
Count of attempted murder

1:07:04.061 --> 1:07:05.771
in the second degree...
Count of sodomy...
Count of sexual abuse
in the first degree...

1:07:07.648 --> 1:07:10.568
And to the count of attempted murder
of Patricia Meili...

1:07:12.778 --> 1:07:14.405
the jury finds the defendant...

1:07:16.449 --> 1:07:17.283
guilty.

1:07:34.550 --> 1:07:36.385
- ...guilty.

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:43.225
On the count of assault
in the second degree,

1:07:43.934 --> 1:07:47.480
-the verdict is guilty.

1:07:49.023 --> 1:07:50.941
...the verdict is guilty.

1:07:52.985 --> 1:07:53.944
...is guilty.

1:07:55.279 --> 1:07:56.489
That's my baby!

1:07:56.989 --> 1:07:59.158
...the verdict is guilty.
