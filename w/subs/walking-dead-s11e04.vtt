WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.252
Run!

01:51.945 --> 01:53.446
No! No!

04:04.702 --> 04:05.912
Let him go.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.292
I said let him go.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.815
I never thought I'd see you again.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.612
Yeah, I thought the same.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.701
What are you doing out here?

04:48.079 --> 04:49.122
You alone?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.583
You see anybody with me?

04:52.875 --> 04:55.169
I saw you out on the road with the others.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.173
Who are they?

05:07.890 --> 05:09.017
You one of them?

05:09.225 --> 05:11.102
Crossed a small group on the road.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.564
No. I ain't one of them.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.442
I travel light. Just like always.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.571
We're gonna go. Come on, boy.

05:21.696 --> 05:22.780
Come on.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.451
- Well, that's funny.
- What's funny?

05:26.451 --> 05:27.910
I always thought he liked you better.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.287
Look, I don't know who you're fighting,

05:29.454 --> 05:30.788
but I am not part of it.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.583
We're going. Come on!

07:39.625 --> 07:41.502
Let's see if you were right.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.754
I came back for you.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.927
I looked everywhere for you.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.144
I'm sorry you ended up with these people.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.188
These people are my family.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.776
They never stopped looking for me.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.820
When they found me, I came home.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.788
What about your family, Daryl?

09:00.414 --> 09:01.832
The ones you told me about,

09:02.959 --> 09:04.835
that it was out on the road?

09:05.336 --> 09:06.837
My family picked the wrong fight

09:06.921 --> 09:09.215
with the wrong people a long time ago.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.427
It's like I told you, I'm alone.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.273
You're filthy.

10:24.832 --> 10:25.833
Up.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.590
Again!

10:33.299 --> 10:36.636
The others, are they still out there?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.596
Hmm?

10:38.763 --> 10:39.764
Are they close?

10:42.391 --> 10:43.476
I don't know.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.519
Who's the leader?

10:46.646 --> 10:47.688
Is it the woman?

10:49.690 --> 10:51.901
- I ain't one of 'em.
- Bullshit.

11:03.954 --> 11:04.955
Enough.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.917
Sure.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.047
I said stop. I'll handle it.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.341
He'll crack.
I just need a little more time.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.134
I've given you enough time already.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.971
I said, up!

11:37.822 --> 11:39.240
I need you to cooperate.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.492
I told you everything.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.868
You told us nothing.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.748
Talk!

11:54.797 --> 11:56.841
The one we answer to won't be so nice.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.597
I traded with them.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.558
They gave me some food.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.061
I hawked some gear.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.021
I knew them less than a week.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.735
Unh-unh.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.154
Go ahead, kill me if you want.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.740
I got nothing else to say.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.560
Should have
never brought him back.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.605
- I know what I'm doing.
- Yeah, you keep saying that.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.546
Daryl. Is that you?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.677
The others, are they okay?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.847
Man, I don't know where your friends are.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.516
I don't care, neither.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.561
- But I...
- But nothing.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.020
Just 'cause we shared a bag of grain

14:15.104 --> 14:17.314
does not make me give a shit about you.

14:18.899 --> 14:19.942
Understand?

14:21.485 --> 14:23.487
Whatever beef you have with these people,

14:24.446 --> 14:25.906
I want no part of it.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.033
Hear me?

14:30.119 --> 14:31.537
You need to shut up.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.039
Leave me alone.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.210
Got it?

14:42.256 --> 14:43.757
I got it, yeah.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.469
Yeah, I was right about you.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.347
Should have let you starve.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.268
Asshole.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.658
I ain't telling you bastards a thing.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.744
Get up. Get up!

15:17.416 --> 15:18.876
Let me go!

15:47.947 --> 15:49.448
Just as stubborn as ever.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.412
Is that what you think this is?

15:55.871 --> 15:57.039
Hmm?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.415
Me being stubborn?

16:00.417 --> 16:01.460
Fine.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.129
Hard-headed.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.840
You need to tell me the truth.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.594
I've never lied to you.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.472
Never, Leah.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.018
I'm not gonna start now.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.480
Let's try this again.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.319
What do you know about those people?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.821
I don't know shit.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.534
I'd help you if I could. You know I would.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.996
Just give me Dog. Let me go.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.039
You'll never see me again.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.208
Is that what you want?

16:57.224 --> 16:58.392
What is it?

17:00.936 --> 17:02.187
We found Bossie.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.315
And Turner?

17:58.243 --> 18:00.579
I tried. I couldn't save him.

18:02.873 --> 18:03.874
I tried.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.210
It's okay, son.
You did the right thing.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.088
You brought him home.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.932
Lord, we release
our brother Turner to you.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.976
Please, hold him close.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.923
- In your name, O Lord. Amen.
- Amen.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.236
God is here.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.700
He's angry.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.498
I'm angry.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.170
Do you feel that?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.046
Hmm?

19:36.341 --> 19:39.011
Go make them feel our wrath.

20:35.859 --> 20:36.985
What happened?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.947
One of my brothers is dead.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.159
Michael Turner was his name.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.704
We fought all over the world together.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.791
Pope brought him in after our last tour,

20:50.791 --> 20:52.209
when he started his company.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.297
- I thought you were soldiers.
- We were.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.175
Then we went private.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.637
You didn't tell me you were a merc.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.140
I mean, what does it matter?
It was the same damn job.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.188
Except we could actually pay our bills.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.906
Michael was like me, you know?
He didn't have a family.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.117
He was the little brother I never had.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.411
You know,
the little brother I always wanted.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.249
And he's dead.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.214
You know, we lost a lot of people here.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.674
And that's been hard.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.803
But not like this.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.390
This is the first time I lost
someone close to me in a long time.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.188
Well...

21:56.481 --> 21:57.733
Except maybe for you.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.280
You didn't lose me.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.700
I came back and you were gone.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.665
You left me.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.835
I asked you what you wanted.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.296
You left.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.009
I got scared.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.012
Of what?

22:30.265 --> 22:31.266
Letting go.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.373
It doesn't matter.
We wouldn't have worked anyway.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.084
Couldn't have been happy,
not in a world like this.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.046
Is that you talking or your family?

23:04.383 --> 23:07.844
Like you've never done things.
Killed people.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.514
I know the things you've done.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.058
So you have no right to judge, not at all.

23:15.852 --> 23:20.023
This is me, Daryl, the good and the bad.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.943
All of it, and always has been.

23:23.693 --> 23:24.694
I don't believe you.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.990
Well, I can't help with that.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.208
But I can help you save yourself.

23:39.334 --> 23:42.379
Because despite everything,
I still care about you.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.464
And I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

23:48.677 --> 23:52.180
So you need to tell me something. Anything.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.182
Because if you can't,

23:54.307 --> 23:57.060
I can't control my commander
and what he will do next.

23:59.312 --> 24:04.192
He's angry about Turner
and he wants someone to pay.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.201
There's a woman.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.163
She's the leader.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.918
They were speaking in code
because I was an outsider.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.756
There's a tall, skinny guy,
never shuts up.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.344
And a priest who carries a shotgun.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.556
- That's their leadership?
- Yeah.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.266
But they have the numbers.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.226
One of their soldiers slipped up

24:38.310 --> 24:41.438
and he was gonna go meet
three dozen of their fighters.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.523
That's way more than the 15 you got here.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.359
You've been doing
your work down here, huh?

24:58.079 --> 24:59.623
I'll have you moved out of here tonight,

25:01.082 --> 25:02.626
so you can be more comfortable.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.594
When do I meet him, this Pope?

25:14.721 --> 25:15.764
Soon.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.287
Well, you were right.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.831
He was hard to break.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.337
He told me there are a lot more
out there than we thought.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.298
More than twice the force we have in here.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.807
I think he'll be good here, though.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.686
And we need the manpower...

26:04.187 --> 26:07.399
with Turner gone, and Nichols
and Montanio still missing.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.741
Say something.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.952
You know I hate it when you do this.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.204
Do what?

26:22.581 --> 26:23.790
Freeze me out.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.587
Not everything is about you, Leah.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.550
- I never said it was.
- No, no.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.430
Because here we are losing a day,

26:38.430 --> 26:40.890
attracting our enemy because you...

26:40.974 --> 26:43.935
you had to go on a fishing expedition

26:44.019 --> 26:45.687
with an old boyfriend.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.255
So go on then, tell me.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.926
You find what you're looking for?

27:21.973 --> 27:24.225
I told you he would be useful
and I was right.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.728
He's a lot like us.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.732
Pain doesn't scare him,
death doesn't scare him.

27:31.858 --> 27:32.984
Carver saw it.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.488
Come on. You see it.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.075
I just see a guy
who wants to get in your pants.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.119
Fine.

27:44.788 --> 27:45.830
Fine.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.542
Who couldn't stop gazing
at somebody he loved.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.838
I never said he loved me.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.674
Oh.

27:57.133 --> 28:01.846
You could have ended him
out there today and you didn't.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.849
Why?

28:06.559 --> 28:08.937
At one point,
he meant something to me, yeah.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.273
I've been open about that.

28:15.402 --> 28:19.572
But it ended the day you found me
and I chose this family.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.701
And I have never once
regretted that decision.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.452
And I don't want you to either.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.080
Do you?

28:40.427 --> 28:41.928
I believe in you.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.100
More than the others.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.563
I know.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.025
You think we can trust him?

28:57.944 --> 28:58.945
Yeah.

29:02.699 --> 29:06.745
Good. Now let me see for myself.

29:11.374 --> 29:12.917
You got something to say?

29:14.169 --> 29:15.628
Come on, man.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.964
Don't be shy.
You're about to meet the man.

29:17.964 --> 29:21.134
Yeah. Save that coy shit
for your girlfriend.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.428
Aw, Shaw ain't nobody's girlfriend.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.306
I'm betting she wears
the pants for homeboy here.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.849
Isn't that right?

29:27.849 --> 29:30.310
You don't know shit about shit,
Carver, knock it off.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.315
Well, guess I'll just show
my dumb ass out then.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.369
Pope is on his way.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.455
Anything you want to tell me
about this guy before I meet him?

29:51.498 --> 29:52.749
Just follow my lead.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.387
Hey!

30:29.035 --> 30:30.829
Here! Take it! Take it!

31:14.330 --> 31:15.707
Come on!

32:15.350 --> 32:17.101
Forged by fire.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.981
Ordained by God.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.318
Welcome him.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.779
<i>Fortitudo Saludis!</i>

32:36.454 --> 32:37.789
You believe in God?

32:40.041 --> 32:42.377
No. No, I don't.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.879
Not anymore.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.590
I guess I just believe in me now.

32:47.674 --> 32:48.841
Hmm.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.051
Well, that's a mistake.

32:51.552 --> 32:53.513
- Why is that?
- You're not him.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.392
I passed your little test, didn't I?

32:57.392 --> 32:58.643
Whatever you want to call it.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.687
You think that's the end of it?

33:02.230 --> 33:04.315
What else do you want from me?

33:05.525 --> 33:06.651
I want...

33:09.654 --> 33:11.489
I want you to understand.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.501
Sit down.

33:28.256 --> 33:32.218
We all met in the valley of death.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.596
That's what we call it anyway.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.391
Hills of Afghanistan.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.185
Fought for our country,

33:41.269 --> 33:43.479
carried our fallen brothers off the field.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.899
Carried so many
we lost count after a while.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.488
Politicians.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.119
They wrote the checks.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.038
We weren't anything to them.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.789
Just props.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.333
Props for their next campaign.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.754
You see, they talked about God.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.257
They didn't know God.

34:12.091 --> 34:13.593
They never saw his face.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.304
Not like we did.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.849
No, we saw God everywhere.

34:21.392 --> 34:24.270
He was in the blood
and the horror and death.

34:25.229 --> 34:28.775
He was there telling us where to go.

34:32.111 --> 34:35.990
Didn't have much else to hold on to
in those days but him.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.660
And each other.

34:42.872 --> 34:43.956
You smoke?

34:59.138 --> 35:04.143
That war damn near ruined
all of us for good.

35:04.519 --> 35:08.231
Came home, my guys had permanent injuries,

35:08.231 --> 35:11.484
they couldn't sleep,
they couldn't find real jobs.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.154
So...

35:17.406 --> 35:19.617
They called us mercenaries.

35:21.661 --> 35:25.748
We did all the ugly, dirty work
nobody else wanted to do.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.669
Got paid for it too, handsomely.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.885
Real dirty work started after the fall.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.394
Never been in a war like that.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.984
Never seen that kind of chaos,

35:53.317 --> 35:56.154
and I had seen everything.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.699
But this...

36:04.620 --> 36:06.539
Oh, the things we did.

36:09.500 --> 36:13.337
All that death, day after day after day.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.634
After a while, I started to feel like you.

36:20.761 --> 36:24.724
Wondering... Wondering where God was.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.644
Till he showed his face again.

36:28.728 --> 36:32.190
You see, politicians, they had
one last war to get behind,

36:32.190 --> 36:35.401
but this time, coming for us.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.115
The bombs came thick and fast.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.535
They did not stop.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.496
We lost some of our own.

36:47.580 --> 36:51.209
I had to run through the fire
to save them.

36:54.086 --> 36:56.172
Found this little church
at the edge of town

36:56.172 --> 36:57.882
and we holed up there as everything,

36:57.882 --> 37:02.845
and I mean everything, burned around us.

37:05.598 --> 37:09.769
When the fires finally died down,
I looked at my people.

37:12.438 --> 37:14.232
I could not believe it.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.611
Not a trace of blood.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.614
No burn marks.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.409
Not even a scratch.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.871
And that's when I knew.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.587
We were the chosen ones.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.217
These men...

37:42.218 --> 37:46.764
these men upon whose bodies
the fire had no power.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.480
God chose you tonight.

37:56.107 --> 38:01.362
I mean, you... you came out
of that fire alive and whole.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.449
Look at you now, sitting right here.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.077
You hurt? Hmm?

38:09.161 --> 38:12.331
Any burns? A scratch?

38:15.918 --> 38:17.378
I've been through worse before.

38:25.845 --> 38:29.557
Are you hungry?

39:03.883 --> 39:05.843
You were right about this one.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.262
'Course I was.

39:11.807 --> 39:12.933
Give him some, Bossie.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.186
Don't be greedy.

39:16.604 --> 39:17.897
He's family now.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.448
You know what he did, don't you?

39:28.407 --> 39:31.285
He walked 10 miles

39:31.369 --> 39:33.412
with his dead brother on his back.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.706
Ten miles.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.126
The strength that took.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.839
You have any idea how grateful we are?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.303
Turner will have a proper burial.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.806
Just did what any one of us
would have done.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.184
Mm.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.567
Are you still hurt?

40:03.692 --> 40:04.819
Hmm?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.029
You need anything?

40:13.744 --> 40:15.413
I just have one question.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.457
Sir?

40:19.375 --> 40:21.043
Something's been bothering me.

40:23.003 --> 40:26.424
Your wounds are on your back.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.510
Pope. It's been a rough day.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.929
Just getting clarity, Shaw.

40:36.892 --> 40:39.812
Where were you
when Turner was being attacked?

40:39.812 --> 40:41.730
I was right there, just like I told you.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.149
Uh-huh.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.986
- Facing the enemy?
- Yeah.

40:47.403 --> 40:48.904
He's been through enough.

40:59.915 --> 41:03.002
Human nature to run when you are scared.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.963
You know what that's like, right?

41:10.676 --> 41:14.805
It takes divine strength
to face your fear head on,

41:16.140 --> 41:18.184
risk everything for someone else.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.729
We all saw what you did.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.441
Getting Shaw out of the fire first,
and you felt it.

41:25.441 --> 41:26.859
Huh?

41:27.568 --> 41:31.614
How far he would go just to keep you safe.

41:33.949 --> 41:38.245
Today, God baptized you in that fire.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.416
Made you one of us.

41:45.753 --> 41:46.879
You see,

41:48.005 --> 41:51.300
there's one thing I forgot to tell you.

41:52.092 --> 41:54.136
Never turn your back on your brother.

42:00.059 --> 42:03.437
God doesn't only use
fire as his baptism...

42:08.692 --> 42:10.194
it's also his wrath.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.325
No!

42:36.762 --> 42:38.764
We are the chosen ones.

42:40.808 --> 42:44.228
We run into the battle.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.647
We run into the fire.

42:51.485 --> 42:52.987
Always.
