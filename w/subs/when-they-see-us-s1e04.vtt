Turn profile.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.263

02:20.098 --> 02:22.433
-I... I don't know--
- Turn sideways.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.814
No, keep the card facing me.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.803
Damn, Porter! You back already?

02:59.679 --> 03:02.140
Be it ever so humble,
ain't no place like home.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.643
Hey, but make sure you put your boy
on that kitchen work.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.270
You know what it takes.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.273
You ain't saying nothing, big homie.
I got you.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.399
You got me?

03:14.110 --> 03:15.111
You a trip.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.827
All right, everybody.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.664
I'm going to assume you're all familiar
with the game Simon Says.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.501
I'm Simon.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.546
And Simon says

03:33.922 --> 03:35.215
get butt-ass naked

03:35.840 --> 03:37.050
and lift your nut sacks.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.394
Don't look at me, motherfucker!

03:50.980 --> 03:51.898
This is you.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.359
Cool?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.322
Yeah, thanks.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.157
-Seven!

04:07.413 --> 04:09.332
Let me know if there's anything
you can do for me.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.417
Huh?

04:11.501 --> 04:14.087
I said, let me know if there's anything
you can do for me.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.883
-What you mean?
- I mean what I said.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.843
It's not hard to figure out.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.600
I don't know what you mean.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.603
I'm not... I'm not supposed to be here.

04:33.898 --> 04:34.857

07:19.730 --> 07:21.816
KRS, he's holding it down, man!

07:22.358 --> 07:23.568
Hey, man.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.862
Hey, I don't mind you, man.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.408
-Korey.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.618
I know. Everybody know.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.122
Seen the news and everything.

07:37.790 --> 07:38.916
Crazy, man.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.711
Yeah.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.629
Crazy.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.757
So where'd they put the other four dudes
that did the rape with you?

07:50.511 --> 07:51.512
We ain't do that.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.556
Shit.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.892
You know, I ain't mean it like that, man.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.102
I was just wondering, like, what happened.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.440
Well, they went to juvie.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.817
Somewhere, I don't even know.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.527
All I know is...

08:08.279 --> 08:09.739
I'm in here and they not.

08:10.907 --> 08:11.908
I hate it here.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.662
You can ask for a transfer.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.540
-A what?
-A transfer.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.086
-You can do that?
-Yeah.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.839
I mean, all you gotta do is just,
like, write a letter.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.342
I hear it takes, like, a year or two
sometimes or something.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.718
But, hey, I mean,

08:31.093 --> 08:32.929
somebody in the library
handles that stuff.

08:33.054 --> 08:33.971
You just write a letter?

08:34.055 --> 08:35.223
-Yeah.

08:35.973 --> 08:36.849
Roll.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.018
-Get going.
- All right.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.144
See you later.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.732
- Peace, bro. I'll get with you.
-Yeah.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.573
Excuse me.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.244
Whoa, where you going, little man?

08:56.827 --> 08:59.413
- I was just going--
- You was just what?

09:00.498 --> 09:02.667
-You kickin' with us!
- Where you from, man?

09:02.750 --> 09:05.211
I'm from Schomburg in Harlem.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.379
-Word?
-Yeah.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.964
I heard Schomburg niggas hoes.

09:08.047 --> 09:08.881
What?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.384
-You a hoe, Korey?
-No, no, no, no. Look...

09:11.509 --> 09:12.718
I don't want no problems.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.345
-What?
-I said I don't want no problems.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.264
You don't have to hurt me.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.057
Yeah, you right.
We don't have to hurt you.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.600
Come on, please.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.272
Stop! Stop! Stop!

09:25.898 --> 09:27.108
I said stop!

09:27.733 --> 09:29.986
Stop!

09:30.611 --> 09:33.155
Stop! Stop! Stop!

09:49.463 --> 09:51.173
Apply the anesthetic twice a day.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.553
Or you'll be back with an infection
and I ain't got nothing much for that.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.684
They can't just do that.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.354
Maybe...

10:06.897 --> 10:08.357
I could talk to a guard or...

10:09.317 --> 10:10.234
or a warden?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.987
-Something?
-And the next time I see you,

10:14.238 --> 10:16.032
you'll need way more than medicine.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.290
What am I supposed to do? Just let...

10:24.373 --> 10:27.293
let them do whatever they want to do?
Whatever?

10:28.252 --> 10:29.754
The fuck am I supposed to say?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.341
I just need help.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.779
I helped you.
I did my job.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.050
Now you're free to go.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.557
Central Park.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.657
Let me know
if you can do anything for me.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.500
It's a long way down.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.781
How you doing?

12:26.036 --> 12:27.121
I'm surviving.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.707
You know, surviving.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.506
I was hoping I could see you before now.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.593
I've been trying.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.221
It is not easy getting
all the way out here.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.682
-Okay, and there's a lot going on.
-I know.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.226
-And it ain't easy--
-It's all good.

12:53.856 --> 12:54.940
I just miss you.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.699
But you're here now. You're here now.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.329
Yeah.
How you holding up?

13:16.462 --> 13:17.463
I've been better.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.966
Anything I can do? Anything.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.179
No, baby, there's...

13:26.931 --> 13:28.015
nothing you can do.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.032
Your brother been here to visit you?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.078
Which one?

13:51.580 --> 13:52.748
You know which one.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.502
The only one that would come.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.047
No.

14:00.464 --> 14:01.507
Marci ain't come.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.676
How is he?
I wouldn't know.

14:10.724 --> 14:13.644
Maybe... Maybe he come with you
next time you come.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.229
Maybe?

14:16.188 --> 14:17.606
You tell him I asked.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.025
You know that's not gonna happen.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.030
What about Yusef?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.449
I was thinking maybe
you could have Yusef write?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.162
Imma have to work on that one.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.624
You know me and his mama
ain't exactly the best of friends,

14:36.041 --> 14:38.752
but maybe they'll let him do it
from his little boot camp.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.641
What, um...

14:54.310 --> 14:56.020
What is it like for you in here?

14:59.982 --> 15:00.858
Hm?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.619
I don't know. Weird.

15:14.830 --> 15:15.706
You, um...

15:16.123 --> 15:17.291
You sure you're okay?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.210
Ain't nobody tried to hurt you in here,
have they?

15:29.011 --> 15:31.347
They said if I'm good,
I can get off on parole.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.193
That'd be good.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.989
<i>I'm good, Mama. I'm good.</i>

15:49.281 --> 15:50.324
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:51.408 --> 15:52.409
<i>I know.</i>

15:53.827 --> 15:55.120
<i>I'm sorry to ask,</i>

15:55.412 --> 15:58.540
<i>but can you put a little something extra</i>
<i>on my commissary account?</i>

15:59.458 --> 16:01.794
Mama, not much. Any little bit helps.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.004
Ten, twenty. Just...

16:04.505 --> 16:05.714
Just to add to my books.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.764
Boy, I ain't got nothing to give you.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.559
I ain't got it.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.520
But, um...

16:20.396 --> 16:21.605
I will work on that.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.071
I'll make it easier.

16:30.739 --> 16:31.824
I'll make it easier.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.159
I'll...

16:37.955 --> 16:39.581
I'll write up a transfer.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.335
I can get help from...

16:43.919 --> 16:45.004
from the library.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.340
I can write up a transfer
and I'll make it easier.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.883
And you can come see me more.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.056
Okay.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.607
You cool?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.277
You tell me.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.154
I do what I can.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.781
They're not fucking with you.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.159
-Right?
-Not today.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.747
-But they look a little hungry.
- Next time,

17:19.830 --> 17:23.042
and there will probably be a next time,
despite me looking out,

17:24.126 --> 17:25.502
ask for solitary.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.173
Don't go to the infirmary.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.717
Infirmary's for snitches.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.346
Keep 'em coming.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.682
And let me know what you need.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.580
<i>They went to juvie.</i>

18:02.247 --> 18:03.791
<i>Somewhere, I don't even know.</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:05.459
<i>All I know is...</i>

18:07.294 --> 18:08.754
<i>I'm in here and they not.</i>

18:08.837 --> 18:11.215
<i>Hm.</i> <i>You can ask for a transfer.</i>

18:12.049 --> 18:14.259
- <i>A what? You can do that?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

18:14.343 --> 18:17.096
<i>I mean, all you gotta do is just, like,</i>
<i>write a letter.</i>

<i>I promise, Mama.</i>

19:01.223 --> 19:02.683
<i>How you been, man?</i>

19:06.520 --> 19:07.813
<i>Holding it down.</i>

19:08.355 --> 19:11.024
<i>We know what you did to</i>
<i>that white woman in the park, you fucker!</i>

19:11.108 --> 19:13.110
Welcome to Attica, motherfucker!

19:13.193 --> 19:16.071
I don't know what you
fighting it for, boy. This is happening!

19:16.321 --> 19:18.031
Consider it a friendly welcome.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.117
- Fucker!
- Taste of this every day

19:20.200 --> 19:21.702
till you dead and you gone!

19:24.788 --> 19:26.498
- Let go of me!
-Guard!

19:33.630 --> 19:36.800
I know you're not supposed to be here.
Get the fuck out of here, Michaels.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.473
What's going on, boys?

19:45.017 --> 19:45.851
Newbie?

19:49.938 --> 19:51.148
Do you need help?

19:52.900 --> 19:53.901
I'm good.
He said he's good.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.866
Was I asking you? Get to work.

20:19.843 --> 20:20.761
Get him.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.824
Oh, fuck me.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.870
Shit. Jesus.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.623
-Okay, we gotta get you to the infirmary.

20:49.706 --> 20:50.916
No.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.085
No.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.255
Hey. Hey, what's that?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.134
They gonna kill me.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.012
They gonna kill me.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.392
Put me in solitary.

21:11.895 --> 21:12.896
Put me in solitary.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.191
<i>Put me in solitary.</i>

21:22.239 --> 21:24.992
<i>Want to go downtown</i>
<i>with your buddy? You'll be right back.</i>

21:26.034 --> 21:28.328
<i>Your moms will kill me if I don't, so...</i>

21:28.996 --> 21:30.706
<i></i>
<i>You're a good friend, you know?</i>

21:31.248 --> 21:32.499
<i>Sticking with your buddy.</i>

21:32.749 --> 21:34.418
- <i>Pollo!</i>

21:38.922 --> 21:39.923
Chow.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.137
<i>Let's get you out of trouble, son.</i>

21:45.304 --> 21:47.848
<i>Don't you wanna go home?</i>
<i>We can fix this.</i>

21:47.931 --> 21:50.684
- <i>Pollo! Let's go in the park.</i>

22:30.223 --> 22:34.561
<i>The only reason</i>
<i>that you got caught up in all of this...</i>

22:36.271 --> 22:38.982
<i>is 'cause you went down there</i>
<i>to the station with him.</i>

22:39.566 --> 22:42.611
- <i>Pollo! Let's go in the park.</i>

22:44.321 --> 22:45.739
I'll be fine.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.240
<i>Did you skip school?</i>

22:47.866 --> 22:49.743
<i>On April 19th, 1989?</i>

22:50.994 --> 22:53.121
<i>You're here to answer questions.</i>

22:55.248 --> 22:56.249
<i>Answer the question.</i>

23:00.128 --> 23:02.172
<i>What is it like for you in here?</i>

23:43.338 --> 23:44.506
A chin...

23:46.425 --> 23:47.509
a mouth...

23:49.177 --> 23:50.345
a nose...

23:52.180 --> 23:53.557
a forehead...

23:55.016 --> 23:56.935
back of the head...

23:57.894 --> 23:59.271
long hair...

23:59.980 --> 24:01.273
Hey, little bro.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.320
Hey, Norman. What?

24:07.571 --> 24:08.822
Every time you make that face,

24:08.905 --> 24:11.450
it remind me of that time I caught you
skipping school. Remember that?

24:11.533 --> 24:13.326
-Remember that?

24:15.537 --> 24:16.371
Yeah.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.165
Korey.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.504
-Hey, big bro.
-Don't "Hey, big bro" me.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.300
-You're supposed to be in school, man.
-I know, I know, I know. I...

24:30.343 --> 24:31.845
Give me some of these chips.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.976
<i>I worry about you, Korey.</i>

24:38.226 --> 24:39.186
Why?

24:40.437 --> 24:41.563
When you were a little kid,

24:41.646 --> 24:43.565
do you remember what you told me
you wanted to be?

24:46.485 --> 24:48.028
-Yeah, I remember.
-What?

24:48.695 --> 24:49.779
A police officer,

24:49.863 --> 24:52.240
because I... I like the uniform.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.994
Most kids start out wanting to be
a doctor or teacher,

24:56.328 --> 24:58.079
football player, police, whatever.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.999
But when they don't learn the discipline
it takes,

25:01.082 --> 25:02.751
they end up doing a job they hate.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.628
Or worse, they end up on the street.
You want to end up
flipping burgers forever

25:08.423 --> 25:10.175
or begging people
to let you sleep on their sofa?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.595
<i>No, I want a good life.</i>

25:15.013 --> 25:16.014
Well, guess what?

25:17.140 --> 25:18.266
-Guess what?
-What?

25:18.350 --> 25:19.434
You can do it.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.187
Faggot.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.108
How come everybody
always look at you like that?

25:32.864 --> 25:34.616
They're blind to beauty, baby boy.

25:34.741 --> 25:35.700
That's all.

25:36.701 --> 25:37.702
They're blind.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.125
So you been hearing me?

25:45.335 --> 25:46.378
You gonna do better?

25:48.547 --> 25:49.506
I promise.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.258
Shake on it.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.472
<i>I love you, big bro.</i>

26:02.686 --> 26:03.979
I love you too, Korey.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.342
Get cleaned up, okay?

26:35.385 --> 26:36.595
And, uh, get dressed.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.555
Chaplain wants to talk to you.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.937
How long I been in here, anyway?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.149
It's been a while, kid.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.734
Been a good while.

26:59.242 --> 27:02.370
We regret to inform you
that your brother has passed away.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.250
Norman.

27:16.635 --> 27:20.013
I'm afraid he was murdered last Tuesday.

27:27.937 --> 27:30.315
<i>Get the fuck out of my house!</i>

27:30.398 --> 27:31.983
<i>You think I wanna fucking be here?</i>

27:32.067 --> 27:34.736
-I don't know where you wanna be!
-What are you fighting about now?

27:34.819 --> 27:36.821
Your brother belongs in a crazy house.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.199
Your brother wants to be your sister.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.578
Your fucking sister?

27:44.746 --> 27:45.997
You, boy...

27:46.498 --> 27:47.499
you're crazy.

27:48.041 --> 27:48.958
You're sick!

27:49.334 --> 27:51.419
-I'm leaving. Done. I'm leaving.
-Why?

27:51.503 --> 27:52.587
Go on. Go.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.757
Mad 'cause I won't let him rip and run
in and up out of here

27:55.840 --> 27:57.717
looking any old kind of way.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.594
Look at him!

28:00.387 --> 28:02.180
You're a fucking joke.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.142
And everybody is laughing at you,

28:06.226 --> 28:08.770
in your face and behind your back.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.647
Korey, you know I ain't lying.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.025
But I'm done with it.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.779
I'm done losing businesses
and friends and everything

28:17.862 --> 28:19.280
'cause of your twisted ass.

28:19.739 --> 28:20.573
Go!

28:22.909 --> 28:24.536
This is <i>my </i>house, Norman.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.123
Marci! Okay? It's Marci!

28:32.794 --> 28:37.507
Fuck, you won't ever
hear <i>me </i>call you that. Ever!

28:37.841 --> 28:38.717
Norman!

28:38.800 --> 28:41.010
-Norman,  Norman, Norman!
- Mama!
Mama, let's talk it out.
Let's talk it out.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.890
It's not nothing to talk about. I'm done!

28:46.474 --> 28:49.394
You are a sad woman, Mama. Sad!

28:49.686 --> 28:50.687
Uh-uh.

28:51.646 --> 28:55.066
Don't you fix your mouth
to tell me what I am.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.735
You don't know me.

28:58.486 --> 29:01.656
You don't know <i>nothing </i>about being me.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.784
'Cause you got on my shit,
you think you know me?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.706
What you know about being a mother?

29:09.914 --> 29:11.082
With no help.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.671
With nobody but yourself to depend on.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.715
You don't know shit.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.635
I know you're sad, Mama.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.846
And I know nobody made you that way.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.015
And I didn't make you sad,
you did that to yourself!

29:27.098 --> 29:29.642
Miss me with the psychoanalysis, huh?

29:29.726 --> 29:31.060
You dealing out the fucking house!

29:31.144 --> 29:32.645
-Are you kidding me?
-Shut up!

29:32.729 --> 29:35.023
You shut your filthy mouth, you demon.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.448
Like I said, a sad woman.
At least I'm a <i>real </i>woman.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.057
I'll see you soon. Okay?

30:12.143 --> 30:13.269
Take care of yourself.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.438
Promise?

30:17.106 --> 30:17.982
Promise?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.154
I promise. I promise.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.701
What about your stuff?

30:29.452 --> 30:31.579
Just take what you want.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.166
Get rid of everything else.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.921
I'm done with everything here.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.551
Except for you.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.533
Uh...

31:13.621 --> 31:14.831
I should call my moms.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.208
Make sure she okay.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.670
We're here to make sure
that <i>you're </i>okay, Korey.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.551
-Me?
- Yes, we are here for you.

31:26.634 --> 31:27.760
You're here for me.

31:28.928 --> 31:31.139
Uh, nah, I'll be here forever, sir.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.141
I'm not sure what you mean.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.810
- If there is anything--
-I'm gonna be here forever, sir!

31:35.894 --> 31:37.604
- All right.
-I don't know what you mean!
All right, come on. Let's go, kid.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.357
-Come on.
-Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

31:41.524 --> 31:42.734
You don't give a fuck about me!

31:42.817 --> 31:46.112
- All right--
-Nobody give a fuck about me!

31:46.279 --> 31:48.698
Nobody gives a fuck about me!

31:50.742 --> 31:52.035
You don't give a fuck about me!

31:52.118 --> 31:53.870
-Okay. All right.
- Fuck!

31:55.955 --> 31:56.831
Fuck...

31:57.415 --> 31:58.374
All right.

32:01.336 --> 32:05.089
Look, calm down. Come on, calm down.
You gotta keep cool, kid. Come on.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.247
All right, kid.

32:41.084 --> 32:44.087
- Yo, man!
- It's fucking hot!

32:44.754 --> 32:46.255
Yo, where the fuck is the air?

32:48.925 --> 32:50.385
What the fuck, man?!

32:50.468 --> 32:53.054
- I already put in the order.
- What?

32:54.889 --> 32:56.474
You said that last week, guard!

32:56.766 --> 32:57.934
I'm burning up!
<i>Give me air!</i>

33:05.400 --> 33:06.859
<i>Let's go in the park!</i>

33:06.943 --> 33:09.070
<i>-Let's go! Hurry up!</i>

33:09.737 --> 33:12.281
<i>-Come on, bro! Hurry up, let's go!</i>

33:13.074 --> 33:14.200
Let's go!

33:15.284 --> 33:17.829
-I need some air!
- Wise, you okay in there?

33:19.622 --> 33:20.456
Yeah.

33:21.749 --> 33:22.750
Who's there?
It's Roberts.

33:26.838 --> 33:27.964
The white one.

33:28.589 --> 33:29.549
With the goatee.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.886
My friend, the guard.

33:35.888 --> 33:36.931
You brought me a...

33:38.057 --> 33:39.851
a nice cool air conditioner?

33:40.727 --> 33:42.145
Nah, something better.

33:49.652 --> 33:52.530
Brought you some stuff to read.
That okay?

34:00.496 --> 34:01.497
Yeah.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.666
Man, you could bring me a...

34:04.751 --> 34:07.336
a TV and Nintendo.

34:08.379 --> 34:09.255
Nah.

34:09.922 --> 34:14.093
Those, uh, video games are
robbing the youth of their ambition.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.304
You stick to reading, all right?

34:19.932 --> 34:23.686
-I get any letters or phone calls?
- I don't know, kid.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.355
You know what? Let me check, all right?

34:27.356 --> 34:28.941
Yeah. Thanks.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.778

35:30.044 --> 35:32.463
-You know chia seeds are good for you?
-Okay.

35:32.547 --> 35:36.592
Man, I'm thinking when I get out of here,
I'm gonna get myself a Chia Pet.

I don't know, man.

37:20.863 --> 37:22.031
I can't go up there.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.492
Them Nazis gonna hang me.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.161
No, kid, you don't have to worry
about them.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.163
Not while I'm around.

37:29.997 --> 37:30.915
Okay?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.545
I don't even know what to say.

37:36.837 --> 37:40.174
<i>Then don't say a thing.</i>
<i>Okay? Just don't make me regret it.</i>

37:41.133 --> 37:42.760
<i>Why you so nice to me, man?</i>
<i>I got a boy back home.</i>

37:45.638 --> 37:47.974
<i>If what happened to you</i>
<i>happened to him, well...</i>

37:48.391 --> 37:50.810
<i>I'd want to know somebody's treating him</i>
<i>like a human being.</i>

38:41.986 --> 38:43.988
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, let it blow!

38:44.989 --> 38:46.073
Oh...

38:46.157 --> 38:48.909
- Woohoo!
-Wait, wait, wait, wait...

38:50.244 --> 38:51.329
Oh!

38:51.704 --> 38:54.957
-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

38:55.333 --> 38:56.500
Oh!

38:57.710 --> 38:58.794
Oh, shit!

39:01.630 --> 39:02.715
Thank you, God.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.151
Yo, my man.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.320
Turn it back up.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.281
Nah, I'm good.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.382
Deaf or something? Shit's too loud, B.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.550
Don't touch it again.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.053
-What?
-I said don't touch it again.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.055
-Man, fuck you!
-Fuck you!

39:51.972 --> 39:53.974
- Fuck, man!

40:01.982 --> 40:03.109
Hey!

40:04.819 --> 40:06.237
Yo, what's this about, huh?

40:07.071 --> 40:09.073
-What's this about?
- Don't know!

40:09.156 --> 40:11.450
All I did was ask him to turn the TV down.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.911
You know what, Reyes?
You're not even supposed to be here.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.830
Get him up and get him out of here!

40:16.497 --> 40:17.540
Get out!

40:20.918 --> 40:22.378
Okay. Give us a second.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.008
When is your parole hearing, hm? Hm?

40:28.092 --> 40:29.677
-Tomorrow.
- Yeah, tomorrow.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.179
Oh, but you're gonna look a lot uglier
by then, kid.

40:32.638 --> 40:33.889
Just get some ice on it.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.393
And some ibuprofen.

40:40.354 --> 40:42.857
<i>Honorable members of the parole board,</i>

40:44.316 --> 40:45.568
thank you for seeing me.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.698
I never been in trouble
in my whole life, ever.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.284
And when I get out,
I don't plan on starting no trouble,

40:55.661 --> 40:57.788
'cause I'm a good person.

41:02.668 --> 41:06.213
And I have no hard feelings for anybody
or the situation.

41:06.338 --> 41:07.506
I just want to go home.

41:09.091 --> 41:11.302
Are you prepared
to take full responsibility

41:11.385 --> 41:14.388
and admit to the crimes in which
you've been found guilty?

41:21.645 --> 41:26.108
Mr. Wise, until you are ready
to take responsibility for the crimes

41:26.192 --> 41:29.653
in which you've been convicted,
this process cannot go further.

41:45.377 --> 41:47.379
Whoa!

41:50.090 --> 41:51.091
You look good.
You look good.

41:53.427 --> 41:54.470
I do, don't I?

41:57.348 --> 41:59.058
- Yeah.
-You look...

42:02.436 --> 42:03.354
I, um...

42:06.649 --> 42:08.234
I gave my life to the Lord.

42:15.658 --> 42:16.951
After Marci, I...

42:25.668 --> 42:26.502
But, um...

42:28.003 --> 42:29.380
God saved me.

42:30.005 --> 42:31.048
He did that.

42:41.016 --> 42:43.185
-I miss you, Mama.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.187
- Wise!
-I miss you too, baby.

42:53.153 --> 42:54.405
I miss you so much.

42:54.488 --> 42:56.657
- Don't do it, Wise!
-You wanna give your life to the Lord?

42:56.740 --> 42:58.117
-Pray for me, okay?

42:58.200 --> 42:59.451
Okay, but listen--

42:59.535 --> 43:02.037
Let me pray for you. We all have sinned.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.956
Please come back as much as you can.

43:04.039 --> 43:06.959
-Please come back as much as--
-Love your enemies, Korey!

43:07.042 --> 43:09.503
-Please come see me! Please, Mama!
- Love your enemies!

43:09.587 --> 43:13.340
Hear what I'm telling you? Pray for
your enemies! Bless those who curse you!

43:13.841 --> 43:15.926
-And those who persecute you!

43:16.010 --> 43:17.720
-Pray for those who persecute you!
-I love you!

43:17.970 --> 43:21.807
They can't break you, Korey!

43:21.890 --> 43:24.435
-They can't break you, Korey!
-They're gonna kill me!

43:24.518 --> 43:25.644
Korey, I love you!

43:25.728 --> 43:29.857
<i>Come see me more!</i>
<i>Please, see me more! See me more!</i>

43:41.118 --> 43:43.787
Come on.
Floors ain't gonna mop themselves.

43:46.332 --> 43:47.625
There's no library here.

43:50.377 --> 43:51.795
How do I do a transfer?

43:54.965 --> 43:56.050
You want a transfer?

43:56.634 --> 43:57.593
Yeah.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.393
I want to see my mom.

44:08.937 --> 44:11.148
She don't come here no more.
It's hard for her.

44:16.528 --> 44:17.529
Look, kid...

44:18.447 --> 44:20.658
you can ask for a transfer,
but it's a crapshoot.

44:20.741 --> 44:21.909
You might end up close,

44:21.992 --> 44:24.912
but you also might end up
25 minutes further away in Wende.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.873
No. No way.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.004
My bad luck been used up.

45:38.527 --> 45:41.363
<i> Now these are</i>
<i>the first fire trucks arriving in Waco...</i>

45:43.031 --> 45:44.658
<i>a community that has been on the map</i>

45:44.742 --> 45:46.994
<i>in a way that it did not want to be</i>
<i>necessarily.</i>

45:47.077 --> 45:49.288
<i>David Koresh of the Branch Davidians...</i>

46:13.771 --> 46:16.148
- Guard! Help! Guard!
- Fuck him up!

46:16.648 --> 46:18.400
Guard! Guard! Guard!

46:19.276 --> 46:20.944
- Get up!
-Guard!

46:25.908 --> 46:27.868
-No!
- Fuck you!

46:28.327 --> 46:29.620
Fuck you!

46:30.954 --> 46:32.206
Guard!

46:32.748 --> 46:35.501
Get that motherfucker!
Finish him off!

46:44.885 --> 46:45.803
BP dropping.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.138
Hanging a bag.

46:49.181 --> 46:51.350
-Suction's ready.
-We're gonna help you breathe, okay?

46:51.433 --> 46:53.143
-You're gonna start breathing soon.
- Saline onboard.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.646
Okay, here! Look! Pressure,  right here.

46:58.023 --> 46:59.358
You're not supposed to be in here.

46:59.566 --> 47:01.109
How long you figure he's out for?

47:01.443 --> 47:02.945
Full CBC.

47:03.237 --> 47:04.696
If this kid is able to walk

47:04.780 --> 47:06.698
and chew food without pain in a month,

47:06.782 --> 47:09.409
<i>-we'll know he's on God's side.</i>

47:12.496 --> 47:13.831
How you doing, Wise?

47:15.123 --> 47:16.250
Healing up, I see.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.837
Doc said it was gonna take
divine intervention

47:19.920 --> 47:21.755
for you to be walking in a month, but...

47:21.839 --> 47:23.841
look at you now.

47:25.342 --> 47:26.552
A goddamn miracle.

47:28.220 --> 47:30.264
I have a confession.

47:31.181 --> 47:34.476
When I first heard the famous man
from the Central Park Five thing

47:34.560 --> 47:35.686
was coming to Wende,

47:36.520 --> 47:38.272
I couldn't contain my excitement.

47:39.606 --> 47:41.149
I couldn't wait to meet you.

47:42.442 --> 47:44.736
I even had a welcome committee
ready for you.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.616
Anyway, now that I've had the pleasure,

47:50.117 --> 47:52.744
I want to let you know
that we don't have stars here.

47:53.787 --> 47:57.916
We don't care how famous your case is
or if you've been on TV.

47:58.458 --> 48:00.252
We don't take the uppity niggas in here.

48:01.545 --> 48:04.715
So, a lot of people don't feel
you belong around here at all.

48:05.674 --> 48:07.134
You bring too much attention.

48:09.845 --> 48:12.180
With that said, Mr. Wise,

48:12.264 --> 48:15.559
you have the right to leave
segregated confinement.

48:16.643 --> 48:18.353
You're not being forced to stay here.

48:19.521 --> 48:20.772
You do have a choice.

48:25.819 --> 48:28.071
I hope for your sake
you make the right one.

48:28.530 --> 48:29.781
I'm staying here.

48:30.282 --> 48:31.325
Hm.

48:34.912 --> 48:35.996
Wise choice.

48:37.789 --> 48:38.665
Get it?

48:51.845 --> 48:53.096
I'm staying here.

48:54.431 --> 48:55.766
I'm staying here.

48:56.850 --> 48:57.935
I'm gonna stay.

48:58.018 --> 49:00.312
-I thought you wasn't hungry.
-I'm hungry now.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.899
Okay, I said, "Baby, you hungry?"
You said, "No, Korey."
I know what I said, Korey.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.861
There you go, taking all my food.

49:07.986 --> 49:08.904
Yo!

49:09.154 --> 49:11.448
Pollo! Let's go! We're going to the park!

49:11.865 --> 49:13.492
Come on, right now! Let's go, hurry up!
- I thought you was hungry.
-I better look out there.

49:15.285 --> 49:17.579
-No, Korey! For real, Korey?
- Let's go!

49:18.830 --> 49:20.832
Ain't got time for your love life, man!

49:20.999 --> 49:22.125
Let's go! Hurry up!

49:23.585 --> 49:24.753
I'm staying here.

49:26.296 --> 49:27.506
I'm staying here.

49:33.345 --> 49:34.346
I'm staying.

49:34.721 --> 49:35.973
-For real?
-Yeah.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.599
I'm staying. I'll get with you later.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.601
- Whatever, man.
-Keep your head up.

49:40.018 --> 49:40.894
What?

49:40.978 --> 49:42.938
You fell in love, huh?

49:43.021 --> 49:44.648
Now you're forgetting about your boys.

49:44.731 --> 49:47.734
-Aah! Aah! I can't hear you. Go!
- Whatever, man. Peace out!

49:47.818 --> 49:49.277
Yo, peace, baby boy!

49:53.991 --> 49:55.409
Wise choice.

49:55.534 --> 49:57.077
- Hm.
-Get it?

49:57.327 --> 49:59.955
-Korey Wise?

50:00.247 --> 50:02.499
- <i>Never heard that before.</i>
-Never heard that one before.

50:02.582 --> 50:03.500
<i>Shut up.</i>

50:05.877 --> 50:06.795
So...

50:07.254 --> 50:08.422
what's the plan?

50:10.215 --> 50:12.551
Oh, what's the plan? What's the plan?

50:19.516 --> 50:21.393
The plan is me and you, little lady.

50:21.643 --> 50:22.769
Whatever you wanna do.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.229
- Hm?
- Mm-hm.

50:24.312 --> 50:25.605
Like whatever-whatever?

50:25.689 --> 50:27.274
Like whatever-whatever.

50:27.649 --> 50:28.734
Whatever-whatever.

50:30.944 --> 50:32.529
Whatever-whatever, baby.

50:32.612 --> 50:35.574
<i>Oh, shoot. Okay.</i>

50:35.866 --> 50:38.910
Um, so take me to, um...

50:40.704 --> 50:41.997
Coney Island.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.167
- Yeah?
-Mm.

50:47.961 --> 50:49.504
Your wish is my command.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.433
Come on, Korey.

51:46.770 --> 51:47.729
Hi.

51:50.774 --> 51:51.608
Hi.

51:55.320 --> 51:56.154
Let's go.

51:58.448 --> 51:59.741
- Wait, for real?
-Come on!

51:59.825 --> 52:02.828
-Baby, for real? For real?
-Yeah!

52:17.342 --> 52:18.593
Faster!

52:19.678 --> 52:24.015
-Woohoo!

53:16.359 --> 53:17.611
Can I kiss you?

53:48.141 --> 53:49.142
Get up.
Parole hearing.

53:55.273 --> 53:57.025
Can I get cleaned up first?

53:57.400 --> 53:58.401
What for?

53:58.985 --> 54:01.196
Just tuck in your shirt
and wipe the boogers out your nose

54:01.279 --> 54:02.697
and let's get this over with.

54:05.742 --> 54:07.327
<i>Mr. Wise, welcome back.</i>

54:07.619 --> 54:10.538
Are you prepared to admit your guilt
in the crimes

54:10.622 --> 54:12.332
of which you have been proven guilty?

54:37.023 --> 54:38.858
- Oops.

54:39.734 --> 54:41.987
Guess you're gonna be staying with us
for a while, huh?

54:42.821 --> 54:44.406
And they say justice is dead.

54:45.073 --> 54:45.991
Fifteen.

54:56.251 --> 54:57.335
Fuck you!

54:57.627 --> 55:00.338
I hate this fucking prison!
And everybody in it!

55:00.839 --> 55:04.384
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

55:06.094 --> 55:08.805
<i> In the matter of</i>
<i>the </i>State of New York v. Korey Wise...

55:08.888 --> 55:11.308
Fuck the cops! Fuck the police!
Fuck the judges!

55:11.391 --> 55:13.435
You lied on me! You lied on me!

55:14.811 --> 55:17.147
To the count of assault
in the first degree...

55:17.605 --> 55:19.357
-No!
- Fuck this whole goddamn house!

55:19.441 --> 55:21.818
-Get the fuck out of my house!
- <i>Guilty.</i>

55:21.901 --> 55:23.153
You think I wanna fucking be here?

55:23.236 --> 55:25.238
-I don't want to be here!
- <i>To the count of assault...</i>

55:25.322 --> 55:28.033
<i>As to the count of sexual abuse</i>
<i>in the first degree:</i>

55:28.825 --> 55:29.659
<i>guilty.</i>

55:29.909 --> 55:32.245
-Mama!
- <i>Guilty!</i>

55:32.329 --> 55:34.205
I know you tried to be a good mom!

55:34.789 --> 55:36.750
I know you tried to be a good mom.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.840
Thank you for saying that.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.898
Sometimes all you could do
is try your best.

56:05.570 --> 56:06.571
I'm sorry...

56:08.031 --> 56:09.824
I wasn't what I should've been.

56:13.912 --> 56:15.372
I wanted to be...

56:17.957 --> 56:19.459
a lot of things.

56:26.549 --> 56:28.218
But I couldn't reach any of it.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.180
Drugs was easier.

56:34.474 --> 56:36.601
Ignoring you boys in real life...

56:40.105 --> 56:41.398
that was easier.

56:46.236 --> 56:47.946
But being scared for you...

56:50.115 --> 56:53.576
that gave me something to ask God for
and mean it.

56:58.415 --> 57:00.458
Mm, don't cry, baby.

57:01.584 --> 57:02.836
Oh...

57:04.170 --> 57:05.380
I'm good, Mama.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.430
It's all good.

57:48.339 --> 57:49.257
Roberts?

57:52.469 --> 57:53.470
Roberts, that you?

57:54.220 --> 57:55.930
You're gonna wanna see this, kid.

58:00.101 --> 58:03.396
<i>Now, it may be</i>
<i>that something fell off the building.</i>

58:03.563 --> 58:05.023
<i>It may be that something has fallen.</i>

58:05.106 --> 58:08.109
<i>We don't know, to be perfectly honest,</i>
<i>but that is what you're looking at...</i>

58:08.193 --> 58:09.027
You gotta stay awake.

58:09.110 --> 58:10.737
<i>That's the scene at this moment.</i>

58:10.820 --> 58:13.031
Stay living, stay awake.

58:13.781 --> 58:15.700
We gotta live while we can, you know?

58:16.201 --> 58:17.660
<i>The whole side has collapsed?</i>

58:17.744 --> 58:19.829
<i>The whole building has collapsed.</i>
<i>The whole building has collapsed?</i>

Time for your parole hearing.
Let's move.

59:25.103 --> 59:26.646
No, thank you. I'm good.

59:27.438 --> 59:29.107
What do you mean, you're good?

59:29.482 --> 59:30.650
I don't need to go.

59:31.192 --> 59:33.528
You're saying you're not going

59:33.611 --> 59:36.656
Yeah. Tell 'em I'm maxing out.

59:38.616 --> 59:41.411

You're Korey Wise, right?

1:00:07.061 --> 1:00:07.937
Who wanna know?

1:00:09.314 --> 1:00:10.481
You don't remember me.

1:00:14.068 --> 1:00:15.737
Matias Reyes from Attica.

1:00:20.533 --> 1:00:22.410
Yeah. Attica.

1:00:23.953 --> 1:00:24.954
I remember.

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:31.252
You still telling the world
you're innocent?

1:00:35.214 --> 1:00:36.549
What's this about, man?

1:00:37.050 --> 1:00:37.967
Nothing.

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:42.096
I just wanted to apologize for the...

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:45.099
the TV thing in the day room and all that.

1:00:46.559 --> 1:00:47.685
It's all good.

1:00:48.436 --> 1:00:50.521
It's good.
I ain't got no problem with you.

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:51.898
Thank you.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:54.442
Your acceptance means a lot to me.

1:01:00.573 --> 1:01:01.991
Are you religious, Korey?

1:01:02.742 --> 1:01:03.743
Religious?

1:01:05.578 --> 1:01:08.289
That's what this is about?
You trying to convert me?

1:01:15.171 --> 1:01:16.047
You have hope...

1:01:17.757 --> 1:01:18.841
and faith in you.

1:01:19.967 --> 1:01:21.469
And you held onto both.

1:01:26.015 --> 1:01:27.141
Good for you.

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:44.367
He pulled me out of a discovery hearing,
said it's urgent?

1:01:52.125 --> 1:01:54.168
-Ms. Ryan.
-Mr. Morgenthau.

1:01:59.590 --> 1:02:01.676
A con named Matias Reyes

1:02:02.343 --> 1:02:05.096
requested an appointment with authorities

1:02:05.179 --> 1:02:07.348
in the facility where he is serving life

1:02:07.432 --> 1:02:10.101
for the rape and murder
of Lourdes Gonzalez.

1:02:12.311 --> 1:02:13.938
She was pregnant at the time.

1:02:14.522 --> 1:02:16.649
He poked her eyes out
with a butter knife.

1:02:17.984 --> 1:02:20.069
Her kids were in the next room listening.

1:02:23.030 --> 1:02:24.282
He's just admitted

1:02:25.199 --> 1:02:26.909
to brutalizing a jogger.
It's the jogger case, Nancy.

1:02:36.210 --> 1:02:38.588
-Jogger case...
-In the park.

1:02:40.047 --> 1:02:42.383
-Trisha Meili, 19--
-89.

1:02:51.350 --> 1:02:52.351
It's yours now.

1:02:56.397 --> 1:02:57.857
<i>When I first saw her,</i>

1:02:58.649 --> 1:02:59.692
<i>I decided...</i>

1:03:02.445 --> 1:03:04.197
I just decided to attack her.

1:03:06.532 --> 1:03:07.366
To...

1:03:07.742 --> 1:03:10.369
take everything that she had, to rape her.

1:03:12.663 --> 1:03:13.831
I followed her...

1:03:14.707 --> 1:03:16.584
"stalked her" I guess they call it.

1:03:17.210 --> 1:03:18.252
Did you beat her?

1:03:20.213 --> 1:03:21.047
Yes.

1:03:21.839 --> 1:03:23.007
Did you rape her?

1:03:24.967 --> 1:03:25.968
Yes.

1:03:29.305 --> 1:03:31.057
Did you leave her for dead?

1:03:33.935 --> 1:03:36.062
Yeah, I thought she was gonna die.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:42.109
<i>There wasn't a lot of people</i>
<i>out on that path.</i>

1:03:43.861 --> 1:03:45.321
<i>I saw her coming by...</i>

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:48.032
<i>I saw her body...</i>

1:03:51.661 --> 1:03:55.039
<i>I run up behind her</i>
<i>and hit her over the head,</i>

1:03:55.122 --> 1:03:57.500
<i>-but she wasn't unconscious yet.</i>

1:03:57.583 --> 1:04:00.753
<i>Did you use a weapon in the attack?</i>

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:03.297
<i>There was a branch.</i>

1:04:04.090 --> 1:04:05.132
<i>It was pretty big.</i>

1:04:08.553 --> 1:04:10.930
<i>"In the earliest hours</i>
<i>of this whole thing,</i>

1:04:11.013 --> 1:04:15.768
Fairstein acknowledged the track marks
being where one person pulled in another.

1:04:16.561 --> 1:04:19.897
'This is where he pulled her in,'
she said."

1:04:20.606 --> 1:04:23.150
Those clearly aren't the marks
of five people.

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:27.363
When did the theory change?
I was there when it changed.

1:04:35.830 --> 1:04:37.456
I beat her with my fists.

1:04:39.375 --> 1:04:43.170
Then she was trying to run away,
so I picked up a rock.

1:04:51.929 --> 1:04:53.723
-Shut the fuck up!

1:04:56.517 --> 1:04:57.768
<i>Was she conscious?</i>

1:04:58.311 --> 1:04:59.145
<i>Barely.</i>

1:04:59.812 --> 1:05:02.481
It was like someone's nose is broken
or something.

1:05:03.232 --> 1:05:04.734
Her blood is trickling out.

1:05:05.776 --> 1:05:07.904
It's a hard sound, like hard to breathe.

1:05:09.113 --> 1:05:11.240
<i>She was making that sound</i>
<i>when I left her there.</i>

1:05:11.324 --> 1:05:14.744
- <i>It was cold. She was bad.</i>

1:05:16.579 --> 1:05:18.831
<i>I thought she was gonna die any minute,</i>
<i>so I left.</i>

1:05:32.803 --> 1:05:36.349
<i>The real perp was walking through the park</i>

1:05:36.641 --> 1:05:40.478
<i>with her Walkman on,</i>
<i>and drenched in blood.</i>

1:05:40.937 --> 1:05:44.065
<i>No cop looking for the other kids</i>
<i>brings him in.</i>

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:46.651
You believe that?

1:05:47.735 --> 1:05:50.237
-That's what he's telling you.
-Yeah, that's what he's telling us.

1:05:50.321 --> 1:05:51.197
Well...

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:54.116
Are you telling me you really believe
this guy's making it all up?

1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:57.161
Hey, you know what?
Prison gets really boring.

1:05:57.954 --> 1:06:00.581
These people make shit up
just for attention.

1:06:03.125 --> 1:06:07.463
Trisha Meili was violated in April 1989.

1:06:09.715 --> 1:06:13.427
That summer, you'll remember
there were a series of rapes

1:06:13.511 --> 1:06:16.180
that terrorized the city. Four.

1:06:17.473 --> 1:06:20.768
Matias Reyes was arrested
in August 1989.

1:06:20.977 --> 1:06:22.645
Confessed to those, straight out.

1:06:23.646 --> 1:06:25.523
That case and the jogger case

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:27.483
shared the same judge,

1:06:28.025 --> 1:06:29.318
the same prosecutor,

1:06:30.403 --> 1:06:31.988
and the same detective: you.

1:06:33.823 --> 1:06:36.367
And... you never made the connection

1:06:37.201 --> 1:06:39.203
that the MOs were identical?

1:06:41.163 --> 1:06:43.124
No one even asked him about the jogger.

1:06:43.416 --> 1:06:45.543
If they had,
he would have admitted that one too.

1:06:46.002 --> 1:06:50.089
Instead, you let the statement
you got out of the five boys stand,

1:06:50.172 --> 1:06:52.967
even though they knew no details,
no locations,

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:56.053
even though the track marks didn't match,
the timeline didn't match.

1:06:56.137 --> 1:06:58.055
-Nothing matched.
-They gave statements that I believed

1:06:58.139 --> 1:06:58.973
were true.

1:06:59.056 --> 1:07:01.308
You squeezed statements out of them

1:07:01.392 --> 1:07:04.311
after 42 hours of questioning
and coercing,

1:07:04.395 --> 1:07:08.482
without food, bathroom breaks,
withholding parental supervision.

1:07:08.607 --> 1:07:11.277
The Reid technique
has been universally rejected.

1:07:12.236 --> 1:07:13.821
That's truth to you.

1:07:13.946 --> 1:07:16.282
I don't know
what the fucking Reid technique is.

1:07:16.365 --> 1:07:18.868
-Okay? I know what I was taught.

1:07:18.951 --> 1:07:21.662
I know what I was asked to do
and I did it.

1:07:22.288 --> 1:07:23.956
Okay? They knew something.

1:07:24.874 --> 1:07:27.043
You don't confess to something
you don't know about.

1:07:27.126 --> 1:07:28.210
They knew something.

1:07:28.461 --> 1:07:31.297
They put themselves there
and they paid the price.

1:07:32.965 --> 1:07:35.426
And that guy that confessed,
he's the sixth guy.

1:07:35.593 --> 1:07:37.094
Okay? We missed a guy.

1:07:38.137 --> 1:07:39.722
Okay? The fuck?

1:07:40.848 --> 1:07:43.184
Why do you think Wise

1:07:43.976 --> 1:07:47.104
and Matias Reyes had that squabble
all those years ago?

1:07:47.188 --> 1:07:49.607
Why do you think that was?
They were fighting over this.

1:07:49.690 --> 1:07:52.318
They were fighting over
who's gonna take the fucking fall.

1:07:52.818 --> 1:07:55.488
And the only reason
that Reyes is talking now

1:07:55.571 --> 1:07:58.032
is because he wants
a better cell assignment.

1:07:58.449 --> 1:08:01.118
He wants the perks of attention,
and you, sweetheart,

1:08:01.202 --> 1:08:02.203
are giving it to him.

1:08:03.662 --> 1:08:05.873
So don't let these animals fool you.

1:08:08.876 --> 1:08:11.003
Justice was fucking served.

1:08:18.052 --> 1:08:20.221
<i>Is everything you told me today true?</i>

1:08:20.846 --> 1:08:21.764
<i>Yes.</i>

1:08:22.848 --> 1:08:25.935
And for all of the events,
as you've described them in detail

1:08:26.018 --> 1:08:27.103
from start to finish,

1:08:27.603 --> 1:08:28.687
were you alone?

1:08:29.563 --> 1:08:30.397
Yes.

1:08:31.565 --> 1:08:33.317
Were you aided by anyone?

1:08:34.068 --> 1:08:34.902
No.

1:08:34.985 --> 1:08:37.947
Was anyone with you in preparing
for the attack in question?

1:08:38.197 --> 1:08:40.241
-No.
-Was anyone with you in preparing

1:08:40.324 --> 1:08:42.118
-for the assault in question?
-No.

1:08:42.201 --> 1:08:44.703
Was anyone with you
during the assault in question?

1:08:44.829 --> 1:08:45.663
No.

1:08:46.038 --> 1:08:47.164
I did this.

1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:49.333
We all have to pay for our sins.

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:51.252
I sinned, bad.

1:08:51.418 --> 1:08:52.878
I deserve to pay for mine.

1:08:53.087 --> 1:08:56.715
I deserve the time,
I deserve anything that happens.

1:08:58.551 --> 1:08:59.552
<i>That's me.</i>

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:03.597
<i>Hook me up to machines, take my blood,</i>
<i>whatever you need to do.</i>

1:09:04.557 --> 1:09:05.975
<i>I'm ready to pay for mine.</i>

1:09:30.958 --> 1:09:33.252
<i>You got somebody else paying for mine.</i>

1:09:39.758 --> 1:09:41.385
<i>Nobody else should be paying for mine.</i>

1:09:55.858 --> 1:09:58.194
I'm certainly surprised
by this invitation.

1:10:00.237 --> 1:10:01.822
I'm surprised to be making it.

1:10:03.449 --> 1:10:05.284
I'm here as a courtesy.

1:10:05.451 --> 1:10:08.204
Oh, courtesy is the last thing
you're here for.

1:10:08.662 --> 1:10:10.998
You're here to gloat.
But it doesn't matter.

1:10:11.081 --> 1:10:13.542
You've simply identified a sixth rapist.

1:10:13.667 --> 1:10:15.377
I always said there may be more.

1:10:16.045 --> 1:10:17.588
Yeah, you said that to cover

1:10:17.671 --> 1:10:20.925
because you knew you coerced those boys
into saying what they did.

1:10:21.008 --> 1:10:23.636
They said what they said freely.
They confessed.

1:10:23.844 --> 1:10:26.847
I actually think you've convinced yourself
of that.

1:10:27.556 --> 1:10:29.600
It doesn't really matter what <i>you </i>think.

1:10:30.517 --> 1:10:33.187
There's a police commission report
coming out in a matter of days

1:10:33.270 --> 1:10:35.773
that maintains that the five did it,

1:10:36.190 --> 1:10:38.525
and that Reyes is simply
the one that got away.

1:10:38.609 --> 1:10:40.819
It's a 43-page report

1:10:41.028 --> 1:10:43.739
compiled by three lawyers
named by the commissioner.

1:10:45.366 --> 1:10:48.160
It's the police department
investigating itself.

1:10:49.995 --> 1:10:50.913
Linda...

1:10:51.914 --> 1:10:55.501
we pored over your confession tapes.

1:10:56.418 --> 1:10:59.338
We reconstructed the events of that night
minute by minute.

1:10:59.421 --> 1:11:02.007
-I know what was done.
-Oh, you know nothing.

1:11:02.216 --> 1:11:04.343
I know we have a DNA match on Reyes.

1:11:05.052 --> 1:11:09.390
His DNA was all over every article
of clothing and physical sample

1:11:09.473 --> 1:11:12.142
we had of her. Under fingernails,
where she fought him.

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:13.811
The blood on her was from him.

1:11:14.061 --> 1:11:16.105
It was him.

1:11:16.522 --> 1:11:17.690
Only him.

1:11:20.484 --> 1:11:26.490
Well, that simply confirms
that Reyes ran with that pack of kids.

1:11:26.573 --> 1:11:28.993
He stayed longer
when the others moved on.

1:11:38.419 --> 1:11:39.503
<i>Final Jeopardy.</i>

1:11:40.379 --> 1:11:41.505
<i>Likely To Die.</i>

1:11:42.715 --> 1:11:43.590
<i>Cold Hit.</i>

1:11:45.968 --> 1:11:47.094
And the newest one...

1:11:48.053 --> 1:11:49.054
<i>The Dead-House.</i>

1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:53.726
While you were writing crime novels,

1:11:54.018 --> 1:11:58.147
Kevin, Antron, Yusef, Raymond, and Korey

1:11:59.023 --> 1:12:01.775
were serving time for crimes
they didn't commit.

1:12:03.068 --> 1:12:04.194
I watched...

1:12:05.404 --> 1:12:09.158
while more than 30 detectives did
a brilliant investigation.

1:12:09.241 --> 1:12:14.288
We got justice for a woman
who was violated in the most gruesome way.

1:12:14.705 --> 1:12:18.125
We got justice for a woman who was used
and thrown away like garbage.

1:12:18.208 --> 1:12:20.669
Those boys did that.

1:12:21.170 --> 1:12:24.048
We helped make sure
they got what they deserved.

1:12:24.798 --> 1:12:28.135
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna lose
a wink of sleep over it.

1:12:28.552 --> 1:12:29.928
And it's too bad you are.

1:12:32.139 --> 1:12:33.766
Thank you for buying the books.

1:12:35.726 --> 1:12:36.602
Enjoy.

1:12:54.912 --> 1:12:57.206
Let's go. Get yourself together.
Come with me.

1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:18.268
Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Who died?

1:13:40.332 --> 1:13:41.208
Hello?

1:13:41.750 --> 1:13:42.918
<i>Korey, it's Mama.</i>

1:13:43.669 --> 1:13:44.503
Mama.

1:13:44.837 --> 1:13:46.296
Korey, can you hear me? It's Mama.

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:48.424
Yeah, yeah, Mama. What's up?

1:13:48.799 --> 1:13:50.300
Somebody loves you.

1:13:51.468 --> 1:13:53.595
-What?
-Somebody loves you, baby.

1:13:53.679 --> 1:13:54.847
You getting out!

1:13:54.930 --> 1:13:57.683
Mama, wait, wait, slow down.
What are you talking about?

1:13:57.766 --> 1:13:59.101
<i>Korey, listen to me.</i>

1:13:59.184 --> 1:14:02.855
The man who did it,
the man who actually did it confessed.

1:14:04.648 --> 1:14:05.941
<i>He confessed.</i>

1:14:06.775 --> 1:14:09.445
<i>Oh, I been praying for this day.</i>

1:14:10.070 --> 1:14:11.238
<i>You free.</i>

1:14:11.905 --> 1:14:13.198
<i>You coming home.</i>

1:14:17.411 --> 1:14:20.330
<i>My baby coming... You coming home.</i>

1:14:21.748 --> 1:14:22.583
No.

1:14:27.963 --> 1:14:29.548
<i>Betrayed by this city,</i>

1:14:29.631 --> 1:14:32.217
<i>these men were just boys</i>
<i>when they were wrongfully accused</i>

1:14:32.301 --> 1:14:33.760
<i>and wrongfully convicted.</i>

1:14:33.844 --> 1:14:36.722
- <i>Tron, you up?</i>
<i>-</i>Yeah, cuz, what's up?

1:14:37.514 --> 1:14:38.640
<i>Yo, your lady up?</i>

1:14:39.683 --> 1:14:41.059
She asleep, man, what's up?

1:14:41.602 --> 1:14:43.103
<i>You heard the news, man?</i>

1:14:43.896 --> 1:14:45.272
<i>Yo, turn on the TV!</i>

1:14:45.355 --> 1:14:48.567
<i>They were finally freed</i>
<i>not because justice was pursued,</i>

1:14:48.650 --> 1:14:51.320
<i>but because somebody came forward</i>
<i>to tell the truth.</i>

1:14:52.279 --> 1:14:56.074
<i>If the police had done their job</i>
<i>at any point in these last 12 years,</i>

1:14:56.158 --> 1:14:57.201
<i>-if the prosecutors,</i>
- Kev!

1:14:57.284 --> 1:14:59.286
- Kevin!
-<i>if the press had done their job,</i>

1:14:59.411 --> 1:15:02.247
<i>not only would five young lives</i>
<i>not have been destroyed,</i>

1:15:02.664 --> 1:15:04.917
<i>but many women would not</i>
<i>have been subjected...</i>

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.586
-This about you, right?
<i>-...to the violence by the actual rapist.</i>

1:15:08.670 --> 1:15:10.589
<i>The District Attorney announced today</i>

1:15:10.672 --> 1:15:13.175
<i>-the men known as the Central Park Five</i>

1:15:13.258 --> 1:15:17.721
<i>will be exonerated of all crimes,</i>
<i>based on eyewitness confessions.</i>

1:15:18.555 --> 1:15:22.184
<i>The real criminal was free</i>
<i>to rape, and even kill,</i>

1:15:22.267 --> 1:15:24.436
<i>while the police and prosecutors</i>

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:28.398
<i>and puppets like Donald Trump</i>
<i>patted themselves on their fat backs.</i>

1:15:33.153 --> 1:15:34.905
<i>But we didn't give up on these men.</i>

1:15:36.990 --> 1:15:38.492
<i>The community didn't give up,</i>

1:15:39.117 --> 1:15:40.536
<i>Reverend Al didn't give up,</i>

1:15:40.953 --> 1:15:42.788
<i>Congressman Perkins didn't give up,</i>

1:15:43.038 --> 1:15:45.707
<i>Michael Warren and all the attorneys</i>
<i>didn't give up,</i>

1:15:45.916 --> 1:15:48.835
<i>my late husband Elombe Brath</i>
<i>and I didn't give up,</i>

1:15:49.044 --> 1:15:50.504
<i>and these families...</i>

1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:53.799
<i>these families never gave up.</i>

1:15:57.761 --> 1:16:00.764
<i>We are so proud</i>
<i>to welcome these men, we're so proud,</i>

1:16:01.765 --> 1:16:05.644
<i>as they are finally awarded</i>
<i>the proper settlement for their damages...</i>

1:16:10.190 --> 1:16:12.693
<i>as their records are cleared</i>
<i>and they're fully exonerated</i>

1:16:12.776 --> 1:16:14.945
<i>for the lies told about them...</i>

1:16:21.410 --> 1:16:24.955
<i>as they step in fully forward</i>
<i>into the light of their lives,</i>

1:16:25.038 --> 1:16:28.584
<i>despite what this city and this country</i>
<i>has done to them</i>

1:16:28.709 --> 1:16:31.253
<i>and millions like them for generations.</i>

1:16:34.464 --> 1:16:35.507
<i>Now, Harlem,</i>

1:16:35.966 --> 1:16:37.884
<i>now you know how we do things, right?</i>

1:16:40.470 --> 1:16:42.639
<i>Please, Harlem, help me.</i>
<i>Help me, family.</i>

1:16:42.723 --> 1:16:45.267
<i>Help me give a warm welcome...</i>

1:16:48.228 --> 1:16:49.605
<i>Antron McCray...</i>

1:16:52.774 --> 1:16:53.900
<i>Kevin Richardson...</i>

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:57.946
-<i>Raymond Santana Jr...</i>

1:17:00.991 --> 1:17:02.075
<i>Yusef Salaam...</i>

1:17:04.161 --> 1:17:04.995
Mama.

1:17:05.495 --> 1:17:06.830
<i>...and Korey Wise.</i>

1:17:09.458 --> 1:17:10.375
Hi, baby.

1:17:23.180 --> 1:17:24.181
My baby!

1:17:41.865 --> 1:17:42.699
Yeah.

1:18:21.113 --> 1:18:22.739
<i>How come you always hungry?</i>

1:18:22.948 --> 1:18:24.282
<i>How come you never hungry?</i>

1:18:24.366 --> 1:18:26.702
<i>'Cause I eat at lunch. At school.</i>

1:18:26.827 --> 1:18:28.120
<i>-That's why.</i>
- <i>Mm.</i>

1:18:28.203 --> 1:18:29.913
<i>Mm! Look at me.</i>

1:18:32.499 --> 1:18:34.835
<i>Well, now, I was waiting for you</i>
<i>to get out of school</i>

1:18:34.918 --> 1:18:36.169
<i>so we could eat together.</i>

1:18:36.336 --> 1:18:37.713
<i>Everything better with you.</i>

1:18:43.009 --> 1:18:45.220
<i>Okay, I said, "Baby, you hungry?"</i>
<i>You said, "No, Korey."</i>

1:18:45.303 --> 1:18:47.180
<i>I know what I said, Korey.</i>

1:18:47.264 --> 1:18:48.974
<i>There you go, taking all my food.</i>
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

1:18:56.356 --> 1:18:58.900
I'll... I'll take some lunch, please.
