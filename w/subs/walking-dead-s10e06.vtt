43:58.347 --> 43:59.806
We haven't
formally met,

43:59.890 --> 44:02.809
but I sure as hell
know who you are.

44:05.354 --> 44:09.066
And whether my reputation
precedes me or not...

44:16.865 --> 44:19.618
I'm all in.

44:19.701 --> 44:22.746
Whatever you want,
whatever I got,

44:24.122 --> 44:26.375
it's yours.

44:49.523 --> 44:51.650
Shh.

44:57.322 --> 44:59.324
