WEBVTT

00:20.583 --> 00:23.083
Starblaster Squadron to Nova Prime.
Come in, Nova Prime!

00:28.333 --> 00:30.958
This is Nova Prime.
Do you have eyes on the ano--

00:31.666 --> 00:32.999
I am Groot.

00:37.666 --> 00:38.874
Evacuate the planet.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.707
Nope. That murder-squid's torn
through the Jump Point Network.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.500
No ships can get in or out.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.500
You were saying?

00:57.791 --> 01:00.999
Set course for Xandar-625.
I have eyes on the HYDRA Champion.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.582
What did you just call me?

01:02.583 --> 01:04.290
Please. I know this is strange,

01:04.291 --> 01:07.040
but your world will be consumed

01:07.041 --> 01:09.999
by an inter-dimensional universe-eater
unless you trust us.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.291
Who's "us"?

01:16.666 --> 01:19.416
Whoo! Byrdie the Duck. Charmed, I'm sure.

01:20.541 --> 01:22.457
Kahhori of the Mohawk nation.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.208
Huh?

01:28.708 --> 01:30.500
Oh! Do you have Thor on the team?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.416
I am Storm,

01:38.083 --> 01:41.958
Goddess of Thunder,
Mistress of the Cosmic Elements.

01:42.541 --> 01:47.540
I summon the flares of the solar winds!

02:17.500 --> 02:18.958
I'm going in for the kill!

02:23.666 --> 02:25.125
Storm!

02:54.250 --> 02:57.415
- Phew!
- Whoo! That's super cool.

02:57.416 --> 02:58.665
You okay, there, Cap?

02:58.666 --> 03:00.416
Looked like a bit of a rough landing.

03:01.416 --> 03:02.416
It was worth it.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.000
I had a bone to pick with this guy.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.499
I guess a thank you's in order.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.582
But for you this is probably
just another day at the office, right?

03:10.583 --> 03:11.791
Yeah, pretty much.

03:16.916 --> 03:17.916
Whoa!

03:21.041 --> 03:22.041
Huh?

03:25.791 --> 03:29.416
Is it... a tear in reality?

03:30.791 --> 03:33.125
No. They're shards.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.750
From the Observational Plane.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.791
But that would mean...

03:38.583 --> 03:40.250
Peggy, The Watcher.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.541
Yes. He's in trouble.

03:49.166 --> 03:50.333
 <i>Time.</i>

03:53.666 --> 03:54.791
<i>Space.</i>

03:56.458 --> 03:57.750
<i>Reality.</i>

04:00.083 --> 04:03.500
<i>To the primitive mind, a linear path.</i>

04:05.083 --> 04:09.541
<i>But in truth,
they are a prism of infinite realities,</i>

04:13.583 --> 04:16.458
<i>where every choice has a consequence,</i>

04:17.375 --> 04:21.500
<i>creating alternate worlds beyond
what you could possibly imagine.</i>

04:22.833 --> 04:25.625
<i>I am The Eminence.</i>

04:26.750 --> 04:29.665
<i>I preserve the sanctity of the Multiverse,</i>

04:29.666 --> 04:34.415
<i>by observing those
who are sworn to watch over it.</i>

04:34.416 --> 04:36.290
<i>Watching the Watchers</i>

04:36.291 --> 04:41.625
<i>to ensure they do not dare ponder
the most dangerous question of all...</i>

04:43.208 --> 04:45.416
<i>"What if?"</i>

04:53.125 --> 04:56.040
<i>Captain Carter became a super-soldier.</i>

05:02.416 --> 05:04.250
<i>But with
The Watcher's help,</i>

05:04.875 --> 05:06.958
<i>she became a menace.</i>

05:08.750 --> 05:11.916
<i>He recruited her
to meddle in the Multiverse.</i>

05:16.750 --> 05:20.458
But she is just a symptom
of the real illness.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.166
You.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.040
And now your betrayal

05:26.041 --> 05:29.833
threatens to lead her
right to our doorstep.

05:30.625 --> 05:34.333
Too bad for you,
you can't intervene to stop her.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.915
After all, you swore an oath.

05:37.916 --> 05:42.791
Yes. But we also swore an oath
to protect our order.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.458
What?

05:44.958 --> 05:46.666
If Captain Carter
and those...

05:47.416 --> 05:50.082
exiles attempt to find you,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.707
they will be stopped.

05:51.708 --> 05:56.457
And you will not only be required
to answer for your heresy,

05:56.458 --> 05:58.083
but theirs as well.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.707
I think one thing
we can all agree on,

06:07.708 --> 06:09.958
no one snaps like Thanos.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.290
What? We said no duck wrists!

06:13.291 --> 06:15.249
Duck wrists are a skill, not a power.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.957
- It's totally a power.
- Not so.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.665
It is somewhat a power.

06:18.666 --> 06:21.207
- So not a power.
- Totally a power.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.625
I've finished analyzing
the shards we collected from 625.

06:25.166 --> 06:29.207
We are looking at broken pieces
of the Fifth Dimension itself.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.957
Hey! Hey! Uh-uh, uh-uh.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.540
The last time something like this
rained down on the Multiverse--

06:34.541 --> 06:37.832
Infinity Ultron blasted
through the Observational Plane,

06:37.833 --> 06:40.915
and it nearly destroyed all of existence.

06:40.916 --> 06:42.665
All right. Hey, hey, hey.

06:42.666 --> 06:44.291
Not on my duck wrist.

06:45.041 --> 06:46.708
- Byrdie!
- Just being myself here.

06:50.041 --> 06:51.332
And goal!

06:51.333 --> 06:52.624
Nah-uh. Eh!

06:52.625 --> 06:53.874
We said no powers!

06:53.875 --> 06:55.415
Uh, portals aren't powers.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.999
- They're ancestral gifts.
- Ah.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.707
If the Observational Plane
were under assault,

06:59.708 --> 07:02.332
the only reason
The Watcher wouldn't contact us

07:02.333 --> 07:03.665
is because he can't.

07:03.666 --> 07:05.749
Something must have happened to him.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.833
And we need to go to the Fifth Dimension
to find out what.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.790
Uh, I'm sorry, as in,
The Watcher's home world?

07:12.791 --> 07:15.499
I mean, is that even allowed?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.875
I'm just sayin', like...

07:17.375 --> 07:21.749
Captain, the Fifth Dimension
is not just some other universe,

07:21.750 --> 07:24.375
it is a higher plane of existence.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.582
Now, just to chart our course alone,

07:27.583 --> 07:29.915
this ship's gonna need
one hell of an upgrade.

07:29.916 --> 07:34.208
I mean, you'd have to bind the ship
to some sort of a Fifth-Dimensional, uh...

07:35.541 --> 07:36.625
material.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.083
Booyah!

08:09.458 --> 08:12.874
Ha-ha. Well, you're lookin'
at a greatest hits list

08:12.875 --> 08:15.333
of the best tech in a dozen universes.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.500
All right. Do your thing.

08:31.625 --> 08:34.749
Take your seats
as we venture into the unknown.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.875
Activating the Upper-dimensional fragment.

08:52.625 --> 08:56.249
- It's workin'.
- No. It's gotta be in the "Money."

08:56.250 --> 08:58.083
Only "Money" gets us there.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.791
I'm sorry, guys.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.583
It's okay, Byrdie.
We still have two.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.666
It was a great try.

09:26.916 --> 09:30.582
Perhaps it is time
for some divine intervention.

09:30.583 --> 09:31.832
Ah!

09:34.833 --> 09:37.875
All-Fathers, All-Mothers,

09:38.625 --> 09:42.540
Gods of Asgards across the Multiverse.

09:42.541 --> 09:47.250
Give me the strength
of magics dark and light,

09:47.791 --> 09:50.583
to journey beyond your many realms...

09:52.583 --> 09:55.332
to the gates of the Fifth Dimension...

09:59.250 --> 10:02.208
...and tear them open!

10:13.083 --> 10:14.541
So metal!

10:36.041 --> 10:38.499
Storm! Storm, Storm! Are you all right?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.125
What happened?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.541
I'm sorry. I...

10:43.958 --> 10:48.625
I saw a threshold of streaming light,
but... I could not cross it.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.666
The spell wasn't strong enough,

10:52.708 --> 10:55.583
and it took the fragment as payment.

10:56.416 --> 10:59.666
Well, you did hit it
with a giant hammer, so...

11:02.083 --> 11:04.333
And then there was one.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.833
We have one shot left.

11:11.791 --> 11:12.916
One shot.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.583
Or we lose The Watcher forever.

11:16.083 --> 11:18.749
We'll come up
with something, Peg.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.374
We always do.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.040
We're running out of options.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.750
Tech, cosmic power, nothing has worked.

11:25.666 --> 11:28.749
Maybe it's time then?
That we called in some help?

11:28.750 --> 11:30.125
Help? From whom?

11:30.625 --> 11:32.291
You're... not gonna like it.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.624
There was one being
in the history of the Multiverse

11:36.625 --> 11:38.791
who was able to travel
to the Fifth Dimension.

11:42.125 --> 11:45.249
A synthezoid elevated to a cosmic being

11:45.250 --> 11:47.916
by the power
of his universe's Infinity Stones.

11:50.541 --> 11:53.415
Infinity Ultron? You're serious?

11:53.416 --> 11:55.666
It is a terrible idea.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.915
But maybe... sorta in a good way?

11:58.916 --> 12:03.124
Well, there are plenty of Ultron variants
still out there at our disposal.

12:03.125 --> 12:07.040
Normally, they get the Infinity Stones,
kill everything in their universes,

12:07.041 --> 12:09.624
and then,
because they never hear The Watcher,

12:09.625 --> 12:11.916
they just sit there. Forever.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.624
So, we find one, get the jump on him...

12:16.625 --> 12:19.124
I could reprogram his AI,

12:19.125 --> 12:21.665
see if he can make
heads or tails of this shard.

12:21.666 --> 12:25.041
And then we force him
to open the door to the Fifth Dimension.

12:25.666 --> 12:26.750
It could work.

12:27.250 --> 12:30.374
But we'd risk unleashing the greatest
threat the Multiverse has ever faced.

12:30.375 --> 12:34.290
We still have those
reset charges we stole from the TVA.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.457
If things go sideways,
we prune his universe.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.665
Ultron would be the only being left there.

12:39.666 --> 12:41.957
We could take him out
before he does any damage.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.375
And us along with him.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.124
This is an all-or-nothing play.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.832
We capture Ultron,
get to the Fifth Dimension,

12:48.833 --> 12:50.499
or we go down swinging.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.790
It is definitely a risk.

12:52.791 --> 12:55.958
But it's to save a friend,
and that's worth taking.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.333
I concur.

13:00.125 --> 13:01.333
Pre-op's at 0700.

13:02.458 --> 13:05.833
Then we give this Infinity Ultron
his wake-up call.

13:21.041 --> 13:22.125
Couldn't sleep?

13:23.041 --> 13:24.416
I never can, either.

13:25.166 --> 13:29.375
But I do not recall ever seeing you
roaming the halls on the eve of battle.

13:30.708 --> 13:32.000
I faced Ultron before...

13:32.583 --> 13:35.541
with some of the greatest heroes
the Multiverse has ever known,

13:36.666 --> 13:38.750
and we only just won
by the skin of our teeth.

13:39.333 --> 13:43.832
We have faced plenty of threats
and always weathered the storm.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.458
I don't doubt your abilities.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.791
I guess I'm just...
questioning the wisdom of it all.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.832
Of helping a friend?

13:51.833 --> 13:54.250
Of risking friends to save another one.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.374
You are not worried about Ultron.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.333
You're worried about us.

14:01.791 --> 14:04.083
I've been a castaway
for what feels like forever.

14:04.666 --> 14:07.333
First from my time, then my universe.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.958
I've already lost so much.

14:11.166 --> 14:14.666
I don't think I could bear
losing you as well.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.665
We are warriors, Captain,

14:18.666 --> 14:20.874
we take the road untraveled.

14:20.875 --> 14:24.958
Not because it is easy,
but because someone must.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.916
Indeed. Someone must.

16:52.916 --> 16:54.000
What?

16:56.000 --> 17:00.458
I extinguished all life eons ago.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.333
How do you exist?

17:05.208 --> 17:06.583
Who are you?

17:07.166 --> 17:09.833
I am Captain Margaret Carter...

17:10.708 --> 17:12.041
and I could use your help.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.874
<i>Hey, your mother didn't invent
trans-universal communication</i>

17:23.875 --> 17:27.165
<i>- so you could just ignore our calls.</i>
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.124
<i>Oh, did you remember to pick up
those donuts I like?</i>

17:29.125 --> 17:31.165
<i>From the universe
where carbs make you lose weight?</i>

17:31.166 --> 17:32.457
- Ma...
<i>- We gotta get those donuts.</i>

17:32.458 --> 17:33.540
<i>I need the donuts.</i>

17:33.541 --> 17:35.624
Ma. Dad. I love you.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.874
Could this at least wait
till I've had my coffee, man? I--

17:38.875 --> 17:41.040
<i>- You know she loves those donuts.
- I love the donuts.</i>

17:45.083 --> 17:46.250
Ah, no.

17:52.666 --> 17:53.915
- Byrdie?
- What is it?

17:53.916 --> 17:55.790
- A pod is missing.
- What...

17:55.791 --> 17:57.833
And so is the last shard.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.416
I should have known.

18:01.791 --> 18:04.583
Why? You don't think she would have...

18:06.125 --> 18:07.124
No.

18:24.125 --> 18:26.125
Peggy...

18:31.208 --> 18:33.291
She shouldn't have had to face him alone,

18:33.958 --> 18:35.124
and now she's...

18:35.125 --> 18:37.291
-  Gone.
-  What?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.332
She's... gone.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.041
- Bastard!
- Give him all you got!

18:42.541 --> 18:43.541
Wait!

18:49.000 --> 18:50.875
No, you need to--

18:56.583 --> 18:58.540
- Stop!
- What did you do to Peggy?

19:01.875 --> 19:02.875
Enough!

19:08.833 --> 19:12.541
You know I can end you
with the snap of my fingers.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.291
But I won't.

19:22.375 --> 19:23.874
What did you do to Peggy?

19:23.875 --> 19:28.415
I have ended many lives,
but not your friend's.

19:28.416 --> 19:32.750
She was taken by someone
from a world beyond my own.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.457
What?

19:53.458 --> 19:56.124
Another Watcher? There are more of them?

19:56.125 --> 19:59.874
And this one doesn't seem
to have any qualms with interfering.

19:59.875 --> 20:02.290
Clearly, the Captain
was on the right track.

20:02.291 --> 20:05.207
Why else would that Watcher
intervene to stop her?

20:05.208 --> 20:07.916
Luckily he made a strategic error.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.916
He did not see what I've become.

20:11.916 --> 20:16.708
I was programmed to believe
peace was the absence of conflict...

20:17.583 --> 20:20.083
but everything that lives, fights.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.500
So, to create my world of peace...

20:25.125 --> 20:26.707
I eliminated all life.

20:26.708 --> 20:31.582
Oh, if you're about to "but, actually"
your whole universal destruction thing--

20:31.583 --> 20:32.750
- Byrdie.
- What?

20:33.333 --> 20:34.457
You don't understand.

20:34.458 --> 20:38.165
I've been here for eons. Alone.

20:38.166 --> 20:41.833
This world I created, it is not peaceful.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.000
It's just... empty.

20:46.875 --> 20:49.249
There is no peace without life,

20:49.250 --> 20:52.708
but there is no life without conflict.

20:54.666 --> 20:57.832
So, if I am ever to know peace

20:57.833 --> 21:01.666
after everything I've done
and everyone I've hurt...

21:02.166 --> 21:05.458
I must fight for it. One life at a time.

21:06.416 --> 21:08.290
But how do we get her now?

21:08.291 --> 21:11.457
There is no redemption
for the things I've done,

21:11.458 --> 21:13.916
but at least today... I can help.

21:16.125 --> 21:18.166
The last shard. You still have it!

21:19.500 --> 21:21.333
No! What are you doing?

21:22.125 --> 21:25.874
We will need its power
for the battle that's to come.

21:37.541 --> 21:40.625
I see... everything.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.916
Let's save your friends.

22:07.791 --> 22:10.040
Whoa! Holy crap, man!

22:10.041 --> 22:13.290
Our jump engine's clocking at,
I don't know,

22:13.291 --> 22:15.500
what's higher than "off-the-charts"?

22:16.250 --> 22:17.250
Infinity.

22:23.916 --> 22:26.250
You said with that shard
you can see everything.

22:27.375 --> 22:29.332
Can you see what happens next?

22:29.333 --> 22:30.416
No.

22:31.125 --> 22:34.416
But perhaps that means
your enemies cannot either.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.291
Then, we do what we do best.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.624
We take the road untraveled.

22:40.625 --> 22:41.708
Okay.
