00:34.850 --> 00:35.260
Hello?

00:35.290 --> 00:37.860
Listen, we're being attacked!

00:38.620 --> 00:39.780
Find cover!

00:39.810 --> 00:40.880
I'm stuck in a traffic jam!

00:43.980 --> 00:45.940
Just look for somewhere 
underground!

00:45.970 --> 00:48.150
There's nowhere to go!

00:49.040 --> 00:51.440
Sophia! Sophia!

00:54.020 --> 00:55.500
Everyone in the shelter!

00:55.530 --> 00:57.110
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

01:06.871 --> 01:08.241
Quickly!

05:18.250 --> 05:19.560
Don't be afraid.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.210
I'm not going to hurt you.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.650
What's your name?

05:24.860 --> 05:25.880
Are you hurt?

05:25.920 --> 05:26.930
Are you okay?

05:28.361 --> 05:30.041
I don't understand.

05:32.321 --> 05:33.521
What's your name?

05:33.961 --> 05:35.121
Theo.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.481
I'm Sophia.

05:41.881 --> 05:42.881
Are you hungry?

05:53.041 --> 05:54.201
How long were you here?

05:55.601 --> 05:56.841
I hid...

05:59.121 --> 06:01.001
the monsters came.

06:42.201 --> 06:43.481
Don't look.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.250
Come!

07:09.280 --> 07:09.960
Come!

07:12.481 --> 07:13.681
In here.

07:14.380 --> 07:14.890
Hide!

07:14.910 --> 07:16.240
Under the seat!

07:21.761 --> 07:23.201
Be quiet!

09:24.681 --> 09:26.041
Is it her?

09:38.321 --> 09:39.401
Hurry.

09:57.641 --> 09:59.841
Since they came this
is where we live.

10:15.441 --> 10:16.721
Close you eyes.

10:18.361 --> 10:19.761
Try to sleep.

10:23.801 --> 10:26.041
Who's going to look
after me now?

10:31.721 --> 10:32.761
Me.

10:33.521 --> 10:35.321
I'm going to look after you.

11:05.921 --> 11:07.241
What's wrong?

11:10.441 --> 11:13.081
Thomas and Emma went for supplies.

11:13.961 --> 11:15.881
They haven't come back.

11:17.401 --> 11:19.361
We can't stay here.

11:22.201 --> 11:23.761
Before the attack,

11:23.920 --> 11:25.910
my sister said there were soldiers

11:25.940 --> 11:27.360
at the observatory.

11:27.961 --> 11:29.361
I could go for help.

12:21.860 --> 12:22.860
Is there anyone?

12:43.310 --> 12:44.660
Hands up.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.040
Where are my men?

12:49.780 --> 12:50.870
Where are the soldiers?

12:51.190 --> 12:52.460
There was no one here.

12:53.910 --> 12:54.640
Who are you?

12:55.270 --> 12:56.500
That's my sister.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.020
They're in a basement.

13:15.810 --> 13:17.980
The seriously injured 
can't go anywhere.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.760
The food and water are running out.

13:22.020 --> 13:24.300
There are things walking around outside.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.150
The army can help them.

13:27.170 --> 13:28.350
There is no army.

13:29.247 --> 13:30.757
Just a few soldiers.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.610
There are probably more...

13:34.580 --> 13:36.770
still hiding with bunkers and stuff?

13:36.995 --> 13:39.675
We have no communication.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.360
To our knowledge...

13:42.940 --> 13:45.560
there's no government 
or army anymore.

13:47.239 --> 13:48.919
They've nearly killed us all.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.510
Can you talk to the Colonel?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.070
I can try it.

13:59.317 --> 14:00.357
They saved us.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.210
I promised them that
I would get help.

14:04.670 --> 14:05.510
Sophia?

14:07.290 --> 14:09.720
Sleepyhead, are you okay?

14:10.481 --> 14:11.521
Look.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.770
This is my sister, Catherine.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.000
I told you about her.

14:16.401 --> 14:17.441
Hello.

14:18.730 --> 14:19.950
I'm thirsty.

14:19.980 --> 14:20.850
Okay.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.990
How you were snoring 
like a pig!

14:25.521 --> 14:26.841
No, I wasn't.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.320
You were.

14:31.361 --> 14:33.841
Sophia farts in her sleep.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.960
I know, I remember.

14:36.060 --> 14:37.750
Cheeky pig!

14:50.640 --> 14:52.050
Their belongings are gone.

14:52.420 --> 14:53.530
Some rations too.

14:55.650 --> 14:57.350
Where would they have gone?

14:58.280 --> 15:00.800
To their families...most likely.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.080
Your sister is still alive.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.830
That's good.

15:11.010 --> 15:11.900
What is it?

15:14.508 --> 15:16.788
She talked about a ski resort.

15:17.740 --> 15:18.550
There are survivors there.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.600
There's nowhere for them to go.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.250
They need food and water.

15:25.260 --> 15:26.950
Then we must help them.

15:28.170 --> 15:29.550
Easier said than done.

15:30.350 --> 15:31.990
We have to try.

15:36.506 --> 15:38.316
Your sister can show
us the way.

15:40.732 --> 15:43.722
But my men need rest first.

15:49.310 --> 15:50.120
Thank you.

16:07.681 --> 16:09.601
The fighting is getting closer.

16:09.920 --> 16:10.950
We need to move.

16:10.980 --> 16:11.840
And go where?

16:11.910 --> 16:13.060
Well, you saw soldiers.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.320
Shouldn't we try and contact them?

16:14.481 --> 16:16.081
You think they would protect us?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.350
They are fighting a war.

16:17.370 --> 16:18.840
They will not care if 
we're in their way.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.690
They might.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.510
My equipment is here.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.700
I not sure anyone really 
gives a shit, Bill.

16:23.730 --> 16:25.160
Well, maybe you should.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.410
We have to learn everything

16:27.430 --> 16:28.720
that we can about them.

16:28.881 --> 16:30.201
We need to stay alive.

16:32.001 --> 16:33.561
Your family are not safe here.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.350
Will it be any safer somewhere else?

16:36.441 --> 16:38.481
How close is the fighting?

16:40.361 --> 16:42.481
We probably have a little time.

16:42.641 --> 16:44.681
Let's wait and see what happens.

16:44.841 --> 16:47.001
If it gets too close, we go.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.820
Have you seen Theo?

17:37.840 --> 17:39.600
No, I haven't seen him.

17:40.088 --> 17:41.998
You're a bad liar.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.070
I see you!

17:49.210 --> 17:50.640
Oh, you found me.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.680
He wants to know if you 
want to play too.

17:59.761 --> 18:01.081
I have to work.

18:03.601 --> 18:05.201
Go find your book...

18:05.921 --> 18:08.081
and I'll be there in a minute.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.160
What are you working on?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.750
I'm trying to identify the signal.

18:26.340 --> 18:29.030
Science has never really been your thing.

18:32.189 --> 18:34.029
It's strange to see you with a child.

18:37.644 --> 18:39.124
I needed to do something.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.470
You're doing great.

18:41.710 --> 18:42.530
Better than me.

18:42.570 --> 18:43.620
I don't have the patience.

18:44.810 --> 18:45.850
That's true.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.780
I was the...

18:50.370 --> 18:51.450
troublemaker.

18:52.030 --> 18:53.320
That's also true.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.050
They should've stayed in Africa.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.830
Who knows where they're going.

19:07.910 --> 19:09.320
How are you?

19:09.900 --> 19:10.860
Are you clean?

19:14.460 --> 19:15.340
The end of the world

19:15.370 --> 19:17.450
was a good reason to quit.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.160
The need is always there.

19:22.930 --> 19:23.560
Constantly.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.320
Everyday, but ...

19:27.730 --> 19:29.070
I have to be strong for Theo.

19:31.980 --> 19:33.120
I have to stay clean.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.130
That's good to hear.

19:37.460 --> 19:38.540
I'm really happy for you.

19:39.330 --> 19:40.120
Yes.

19:41.270 --> 19:42.860
Now, we just have to stay alive.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.110
So, you and the Colonel...

19:59.330 --> 20:00.510
Come on!

20:00.540 --> 20:01.790
I've seen it!

20:02.500 --> 20:04.750
I see the way you look at him.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.060
I would want to.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.160
If you want to have sex
go for it!

20:16.660 --> 20:18.720
Now, I have read a book
about a talking dog.

20:51.281 --> 20:52.361
You okay?

21:15.081 --> 21:17.481
We've got to get some proper food.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.561
You never talk about your husband.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.180
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

21:30.601 --> 21:31.641
I know he's...

21:34.881 --> 21:36.441
he's probably dead.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.150
We don't talk about it.

21:39.170 --> 21:40.300
It's like we're...

21:40.340 --> 21:41.960
all lying for each other.

21:45.201 --> 21:47.361
I really miss him just being there.

21:49.561 --> 21:51.521
Things weren't exactly great between us.

21:51.961 --> 21:54.201
I'm not sure that makes it any easier.

21:56.241 --> 21:58.761
You and Bill seem to be
working things out.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.090
I swear to God

22:01.110 --> 22:02.640
I should get my head examined.

22:02.801 --> 22:04.121
It's sweet.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.020
How's Emily?

22:07.540 --> 22:09.910
She so happy she can see again,

22:09.940 --> 22:11.540
she's stopped asking why.

22:11.681 --> 22:13.801
Well, maybe Bill will figure it out.

22:14.841 --> 22:16.761
He hates not knowing things.

22:18.441 --> 22:20.641
It offends his sense
of self-importance.

22:39.121 --> 22:40.561
Will you stop that!

22:40.921 --> 22:42.121
Stop doing that!

22:47.000 --> 22:48.170
Oh come on, for God's sake,

22:48.200 --> 22:49.920
didn't your father ever yell at you?

22:51.081 --> 22:52.401
He should have.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.370
I'm so sorry, Tom.

22:58.380 --> 22:59.400
I shouldn't have said that.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.080
Don't mind me. I'm...

23:01.110 --> 23:02.360
I'm...I'm an idiot.

23:02.521 --> 23:03.721
My Dad's dead isn't he?

23:05.681 --> 23:07.121
We don't know that.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.400
We survived.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.120
He probably did too.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.700
You're always tell me...

23:12.670 --> 23:13.560
to prove things.

23:14.280 --> 23:14.970
Prove it.

23:16.001 --> 23:17.041
I can't.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.100
All I know is that your father

23:19.130 --> 23:20.670
will do everything he can

23:20.980 --> 23:22.360
to get back here.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.130
He will get back to you

23:24.150 --> 23:25.280
because he loves you!

23:29.360 --> 23:30.620
Not very scientific.

23:30.721 --> 23:32.081
Fuck science!

23:32.441 --> 23:33.921
Some things...

23:34.241 --> 23:36.121
just can't be proved.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.120
They just...

23:37.720 --> 23:38.700
They just are.

23:42.561 --> 23:44.761
You're still into Helen aren't you?

23:47.481 --> 23:49.401
Let me give you a piece of advice.

23:50.481 --> 23:52.281
Never be a prick

23:52.441 --> 23:54.121
to the people you love.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.320
Fuck science?

23:58.681 --> 24:00.081
I was just being dramatic.

24:00.240 --> 24:00.870
Sometimes.

24:00.910 --> 24:01.960
Sometimes, yes.

24:02.121 --> 24:04.361
In very special circumstances.

24:10.601 --> 24:13.561
We could kick a ball around
if you like.

24:13.721 --> 24:15.281
You don't really want to kick a ball around.

24:15.441 --> 24:16.681
Not really.

24:16.841 --> 24:18.521
I just thought I'd ask.

24:18.961 --> 24:20.361
Maybe Ash would play with you.

25:02.321 --> 25:03.721
Why aren't they killing animals?

25:05.281 --> 25:06.921
They only kill humans.

25:07.080 --> 25:07.570
I don't know.

25:07.570 --> 25:07.580
Maybe animals aren't a threat to them?
I don't know.

25:07.580 --> 25:08.810
Maybe animals aren't a threat to them?

25:08.910 --> 25:09.820
Maybe they're vegans?

25:11.200 --> 25:13.480
And...they don't like the way we treat

25:13.510 --> 25:15.080
other species, so...

25:23.040 --> 25:24.170
Did you lose something?

25:24.230 --> 25:26.480
Yeah, the photo of my
family's not here.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.160
When was the last time you had it?

25:29.250 --> 25:32.160
Umm...it was at the chateau...at...

25:32.721 --> 25:34.401
I put it in my back pack.

25:34.801 --> 25:35.921
Fuck...

25:38.120 --> 25:39.740
Maybe it fell out when 
you were walking?

25:44.480 --> 25:45.210
I don't know.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.810
I lose stuff all the time too.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.570
You took it, didn't you?

25:51.441 --> 25:52.241
What?

25:54.281 --> 25:55.641
No, 'cause you were looking
at it and then...

25:55.801 --> 25:56.921
this morning...

25:57.321 --> 25:58.801
when we stopped you hid
something from me.

25:59.081 --> 26:00.561
I wasn't hiding anything.

26:01.121 --> 26:02.321
Just give me the photo, eh?

26:02.481 --> 26:03.801
I don't have it.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.400
Why would he have your
photo of your family?

26:09.320 --> 26:10.250
He took it.

26:10.590 --> 26:11.560
I know he's got it.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.670
This is bullshit!

26:12.700 --> 26:13.740
Do you want to search me?

26:13.780 --> 26:14.980
Sacha!

26:14.980 --> 26:16.520
This is ridiculous.

26:16.590 --> 26:17.640
I don't have your fucking photo!

26:17.670 --> 26:18.080
Sacha!

26:18.870 --> 26:19.920
Calm down.

26:20.090 --> 26:21.300
You're going to let him accuse me?

26:21.330 --> 26:22.600
Why do you think he took your photo?

26:22.760 --> 26:23.160
Why?

26:23.190 --> 26:24.600
Because he fucking steals things,

26:24.620 --> 26:25.520
to fuck with me!

26:25.620 --> 26:25.920
What?

26:25.930 --> 26:26.780
Because he's a thief.

26:26.830 --> 26:27.720
Look!

26:28.600 --> 26:28.990
Look...

26:29.020 --> 26:30.640
Where do you think he got this?

26:31.880 --> 26:32.810
You lost it, that's all...

26:32.830 --> 26:34.040
Where did you get that watch?

26:34.120 --> 26:35.170
You're taking his side now?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.480
No, I'm not taking anyone's side.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.650
Where did you get that watch?

26:37.690 --> 26:38.140
Tell her!

26:39.240 --> 26:40.040
From the chateau.

26:40.070 --> 26:41.320
You stole it?

26:41.481 --> 26:42.521
No!

26:43.440 --> 26:44.890
Yeah...yes, but I mean...

26:44.940 --> 26:46.170
like you their stole food and...

26:46.200 --> 26:47.200
That's not the same.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.090
- It's different, Sacha.
- No, but...

26:49.160 --> 26:49.990
I mean, they're dead.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.270
They don't use it anymore.

26:51.881 --> 26:54.441
I didn't take the photo
of his stupid family!

26:55.600 --> 26:56.410
Why don't you tell your Mum

26:56.430 --> 26:58.000
what really happened to Noah?

26:59.641 --> 27:00.641
Okay, what do you mean?

27:00.801 --> 27:01.841
Go on!

27:03.760 --> 27:04.380
I saw you.

27:04.410 --> 27:05.440
I was there.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.750
Sacha locked him out.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.630
That's why he died.

27:07.670 --> 27:08.340
He's a liar.

27:09.330 --> 27:10.950
No, he was begging you
to open the door.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.650
You're a liar!

27:11.700 --> 27:12.270
You killed him.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.950
But why...why would I do that?

27:13.990 --> 27:14.560
That's crazy!

27:14.570 --> 27:16.040
I want my photo!

27:16.520 --> 27:17.840
That's all I have left of them!

27:17.880 --> 27:19.330
Give me the photo!

27:19.370 --> 27:20.620
I don't have it okay?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.590
Back off! Back off!

27:24.281 --> 27:25.841
He knows what he did.

27:32.761 --> 27:33.881
He's completely crazy.

27:34.040 --> 27:34.800
He lost it!

27:34.820 --> 27:35.950
Why did he start talking 
about Noah?

27:41.130 --> 27:42.140
No idea.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.170
Did something happen?

27:47.030 --> 27:47.970
No, nothing.

27:49.955 --> 27:51.275
You don't believe me?

27:54.637 --> 27:55.177
I don't know.

27:58.090 --> 27:59.380
You think I killed him?

28:03.430 --> 28:04.040
No.

28:34.241 --> 28:37.041
I'm pretty sure that's a DNA scanner.

28:37.641 --> 28:39.281
They're studying us.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.760
Is that why they took the babies

28:41.790 --> 28:42.560
from the hospital?

28:42.720 --> 28:43.990
They seem to be pretty interested

28:44.020 --> 28:46.000
in babies and foetuses.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.220
Why?

28:47.240 --> 28:48.560
I don't know.

28:49.801 --> 28:50.961
This...

28:51.841 --> 28:53.241
This isn't them, is it?

28:54.241 --> 28:55.841
There's something else.

28:56.521 --> 28:57.841
I think so.

29:00.401 --> 29:02.041
Who are they?

29:02.241 --> 29:03.161
I don't know.

29:03.220 --> 29:04.400
What do they want?

29:04.430 --> 29:06.080
Why are they here?

29:06.241 --> 29:07.561
I don't know.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.700
You said that...

29:11.020 --> 29:11.960
they want to live.

29:11.990 --> 29:12.890
What does that mean?

29:13.601 --> 29:14.881
Doesn't everything?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.200
Look, Emily...

29:16.230 --> 29:18.640
anything that you can 
tell me will help.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.160
Help you to kill them?

29:20.280 --> 29:22.260
But they want to wipe us out!

29:22.300 --> 29:24.480
They've killed billions of people!

29:24.641 --> 29:25.921
They killed my son!

29:26.081 --> 29:28.121
Do you think we're different to them?

29:29.040 --> 29:31.190
Ask Kariem what happened 
to his family.

29:31.220 --> 29:32.700
We kill all the time.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.890
Yes, but you're the one person
they don't want to kill.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.270
Why is that?

29:36.360 --> 29:37.100
I don't know.

29:37.160 --> 29:37.990
You said...

29:38.020 --> 29:39.920
that you feel what they feel.

29:39.960 --> 29:40.970
What did you mean by that?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.340
I don't know!

29:43.241 --> 29:45.281
I didn't ask for this!

30:43.921 --> 30:44.921
Emily?

30:46.760 --> 30:47.720
What is it?

30:55.001 --> 30:56.081
It's okay.

31:00.521 --> 31:02.961
"When she opened her mouth to bark,

31:03.121 --> 31:05.481
"as dogs are known to do,

31:05.641 --> 31:08.201
"something quite amazing happened.

31:08.601 --> 31:10.081
"Hello, she said.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.190
"There was nothing remarkable

31:12.230 --> 31:14.040
"about how it looked

31:14.201 --> 31:17.801
"but to hear her was something
else entirely.

31:18.161 --> 31:21.081
"Because, Bubba the bulldog talked."

32:58.481 --> 32:59.521
Hi.

33:01.160 --> 33:01.840
Do you want one?

33:01.860 --> 33:02.760
No.

33:02.921 --> 33:04.321
I have to keep watch.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.080
You have one for me.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.360
I will.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.800
It takes the sting out of feeling

33:10.850 --> 33:11.800
totally...

33:12.200 --> 33:13.100
totally... fucking...

33:14.241 --> 33:15.681
...clueless.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.450
Can you believe it's only 8 days

33:20.480 --> 33:22.200
since this attack started?

33:23.881 --> 33:25.521
I never really thanked you.

33:25.801 --> 33:27.401
For saving my life.

33:27.561 --> 33:29.081
You don't have to thank me.

33:29.401 --> 33:31.761
I had to make a choice,
and I chose you.

33:31.921 --> 33:33.001
What do you mean

33:34.001 --> 33:35.361
you chose me?

33:36.481 --> 33:38.201
I had to save you.

33:41.041 --> 33:42.681
You said you made a choice?

33:44.361 --> 33:47.121
Yeah, about where to go...

33:47.281 --> 33:49.321
...when the attack was going to happen.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.170
Wh-what?

33:54.080 --> 33:55.070
You saw Chris when you

33:55.080 --> 33:56.120
first arrived didn't you.

33:56.150 --> 33:57.000
No!

33:57.440 --> 33:59.100
Helen, we've already been over this.

33:59.130 --> 33:59.770
You're lying.

34:00.090 --> 34:00.640
Helen!

34:00.680 --> 34:01.550
You saw him!

34:01.580 --> 34:02.580
I didn't!

34:02.600 --> 34:02.900
Bill...

34:05.241 --> 34:06.921
Tell me the truth now

34:08.040 --> 34:09.219
or there will never be anything

34:09.250 --> 34:11.120
real between us, ever.

34:13.321 --> 34:14.521
Tell me.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.730
I tried to warn him.

34:23.641 --> 34:25.001
He wouldn't listen.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.960
All he could think of was
trying to save you.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.600
He wouldn't let me pass.

34:30.639 --> 34:31.620
What did you do?
Tell me.

34:31.679 --> 34:32.550
He grabbed me...

34:32.600 --> 34:34.679
and there was no time...

34:35.400 --> 34:37.121
I pushed him away, and...

34:39.201 --> 34:40.641
he fell.

34:40.841 --> 34:42.360
You left him...

34:42.521 --> 34:43.360
You left him to die!

34:43.841 --> 34:45.521
I had to save you!

34:47.560 --> 34:49.290
How did his body end up downstairs,

34:49.310 --> 34:50.860
in the corridor?

34:52.121 --> 34:53.681
I had to move it.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.820
It was better than having to try to

34:55.840 --> 34:57.180
explain what really happened.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.930
You've been lying all this time!

34:58.950 --> 35:00.720
No, no, Helen!
I did it for you.

35:00.881 --> 35:03.361
You did it for yourself!

35:03.540 --> 35:04.330
No, Helen, I...

35:04.350 --> 35:06.060
It's never about what 
makes me happy

35:06.090 --> 35:07.230
it's always about you!

35:07.250 --> 35:08.320
What you want!

35:08.360 --> 35:09.870
No, Helen, you don't understand!

35:09.910 --> 35:11.460
I did it because I love you!

35:11.480 --> 35:12.060
Fuck you, Bill...

35:12.080 --> 35:12.700
Helen, please!

35:12.730 --> 35:13.930
Fuck you!!

36:44.310 --> 36:45.650
Maybe they're like birds.

36:48.310 --> 36:50.390
Their spacecraft crashed on the mountain

36:50.760 --> 36:52.660
when we tracked their signals.

36:55.465 --> 36:57.415
Perhaps that was the cause.

37:00.445 --> 37:01.795
They behave like birds?

37:03.850 --> 37:05.840
Birds use the quantum properties

37:06.710 --> 37:08.310
of their cells.

37:10.950 --> 37:14.330
They fly in perfect formation.

37:15.210 --> 37:16.100
Navigating as one.

37:17.940 --> 37:20.280
Perhaps those beings are the same.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.520
What does that have
to do with the radar dishes?

37:25.790 --> 37:27.800
Radio waves might interfere...

37:27.830 --> 37:29.940
disrupting their communication.

37:31.810 --> 37:35.000
Maybe they crashed into the mountain

37:35.660 --> 37:36.710
because they couldn't see it.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.820
They were blinded suddenly.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.790
I think that's why they crashed.

37:43.380 --> 37:45.250
Their ship has organic material.

37:46.590 --> 37:49.320
The ship...the creatures.

37:49.380 --> 37:51.240
Whatever was in that charred capsule.

37:54.444 --> 37:57.084
Maybe they are connected to the ship.

37:58.490 --> 38:00.450
So they malfunctioned...

38:00.470 --> 38:02.380
and the ship went down?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.960
No...Suppose their cells are

38:05.010 --> 38:07.150
connected on a quantum level...

38:08.990 --> 38:10.600
They can sense each other.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.010
All the time...

38:15.050 --> 38:16.670
even when they are far apart.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.360
That low frequency that we picked up...

38:21.390 --> 38:22.840
is what connects them.

38:25.460 --> 38:27.420
So there was no communication?

38:27.440 --> 38:28.740
It's how they see.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.560
If we interrupt the frequency,

38:33.580 --> 38:35.750
they're blinded and they can't function.

38:41.630 --> 38:42.950
Are you sure?

38:45.710 --> 38:46.950
It is a hypothesis.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.060
We need to test it first.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.280
Do you want to look for them?

38:59.253 --> 39:01.103
This could be the breakthrough we need.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.110
You do not believe me?

39:24.140 --> 39:25.490
I believe you.

39:27.429 --> 39:28.699
Why are we going to England?

39:30.405 --> 39:32.705
Perhaps it's better there?

39:33.982 --> 39:35.132
Or worse.

39:36.450 --> 39:37.670
Maybe it's terrible there.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.420
I don't want to hear it.

39:42.910 --> 39:44.120
We don't need him.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.050
We don't need him.
We have each other.

39:47.930 --> 39:48.980
Isn't that enough?

39:53.910 --> 39:55.660
You always want more.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.680
Who the fuck's killed it?

41:43.041 --> 41:44.801
You took the photo didn't you?

41:46.041 --> 41:47.201
Why?

41:47.600 --> 41:49.260
Do you think things happen
for a reason?

41:51.041 --> 41:53.201
Like you meeting my Mum
like that?

41:54.201 --> 41:55.641
I just want it back.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.220
Okay.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.490
Then you have to tell my Mum
you were wrong

42:06.530 --> 42:08.400
about what happened with Noah.

42:08.681 --> 42:10.721
You think she's going to believe that?

42:10.881 --> 42:12.361
Convince her.

42:14.321 --> 42:15.921
If you don't, I'll torch the photo.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.240
If you burn it I'll fucking...

42:17.260 --> 42:17.880
What?

42:18.641 --> 42:19.641
Are you going to shoot me?

42:22.241 --> 42:23.081
No.

42:23.801 --> 42:25.201
I don't think so.

42:27.361 --> 42:28.841
Do we have a deal?

42:32.161 --> 42:33.441
You left Noah to die.

42:33.601 --> 42:35.321
Maybe he deserved to die.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.680
How much longer do you think

42:36.710 --> 42:38.280
you can keep it from her?

42:38.440 --> 42:39.680
Eh? Who you really are?

42:39.710 --> 42:40.100
She loves me.

42:40.120 --> 42:40.680
She's my Mum.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.740
She's gonna find out

42:41.770 --> 42:43.950
she'll tell you that she still 
loves you but...

42:45.240 --> 42:46.780
She won't ever feel the same way.

42:46.810 --> 42:47.580
Not really.

42:47.610 --> 42:48.400
You know nothing.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.960
You're going to see it in her eyes.

42:49.990 --> 42:50.410
Shut up!

42:51.840 --> 42:53.600
The minute she stops loving you...

42:53.620 --> 42:54.170
Shut up.

42:54.200 --> 42:54.660
You'll know.

42:54.870 --> 42:55.680
Shut up!!

45:21.700 --> 45:23.920
Helen...No...

45:37.680 --> 45:38.430
Where's Emily?

45:38.450 --> 45:39.720
I woke up and she was gone.

45:39.881 --> 45:40.881
Helen!

45:40.910 --> 45:42.520
Stay with Ash!

45:44.720 --> 45:45.270
No!

45:47.570 --> 45:48.500
No!

45:48.760 --> 45:49.610
No!

45:50.470 --> 45:51.710
Stop!

46:06.200 --> 46:06.960
Helen...

46:07.040 --> 46:08.230
Helen, it's fine...

46:08.250 --> 46:08.880
It's fine...

46:20.960 --> 46:22.130
Helen.

47:13.801 --> 47:14.881
What happened?
