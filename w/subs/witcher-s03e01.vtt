00:12.000 --> 00:13.500
[ominous music]

00:14.625 --> 00:15.583
[goats bleating]

00:26.583 --> 00:28.208
[shopkeeper] How may I help you?

00:28.291 --> 00:30.166
We're seeking a girl and a witcher.

00:30.250 --> 00:32.791
Her with ashen hair
and patrician countenance.

00:32.875 --> 00:34.875
Him a mannerless, blanched brute.

00:35.541 --> 00:37.500
Master Rience
will recompense you handsomely

00:37.583 --> 00:39.666
for illumination as to their whereabouts.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.083
Hmm?

00:43.083 --> 00:44.625
We'll pay if you've seen them.

00:44.708 --> 00:45.875
[door bangs]

00:46.750 --> 00:48.250
[creaking]

01:00.333 --> 01:01.833
[metal rings]

01:04.333 --> 01:06.083
[dramatic music]

01:09.833 --> 01:11.083
[henchman] Step back, Professor.

01:42.916 --> 01:43.916
[Professor] Ah…

01:44.000 --> 01:47.375
I importune you, benignant sir…

01:48.250 --> 01:49.250
Hmm.

01:50.208 --> 01:51.666
[blood splatters]

02:17.375 --> 02:21.416
[Yennefer] Dear friend, if our time
at Kaer Morhen proved anything,

02:21.500 --> 02:24.125
it's that the world is changing
underneath our feet.

02:24.875 --> 02:29.125
Days pass, but the threats keep coming,
fast and furiously.

02:30.791 --> 02:33.708
Sometimes I wonder
if we will ever stop running.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.458
-For your discretion.
-[man] Thank you.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.125
[Geralt sighs]

02:55.041 --> 02:57.458
[Yennefer] There is another ghost
that haunts us.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.500
What I did to you.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.208
I know I cannot change the past,

03:03.291 --> 03:07.291
but I will do everything in my power
to help Ciri grow her magical skill.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.416
And to help keep her safe.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.166
[sighs]

03:14.916 --> 03:19.250
By proving that to you,
maybe trust will find its way back to us.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.958
In the meantime, wish Ciri luck.

03:23.916 --> 03:26.333
It's going to be a long road ahead
for all of us.

03:26.416 --> 03:27.333
[sighs]

03:27.416 --> 03:29.416
Your friend, Yennefer.

03:33.416 --> 03:35.500
[Yennefer] This was the first lesson
Tissaia taught me.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.791
[rumbling]

03:41.416 --> 03:42.500
[rock falls]

03:43.666 --> 03:44.666
Give it a try.

03:46.208 --> 03:49.208
[Yennefer] Dear friend,
even in your silence,

03:49.291 --> 03:52.583
I know you're wondering
how Ciri's training is progressing.

03:53.083 --> 03:55.750
She has great potential but little talent.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.958
-[slight rustling]
-[Ciri sighs]

04:01.583 --> 04:03.625
[Yennefer] That will change over time.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.958
Someday, she'll be able
to conjure something tastier

04:07.041 --> 04:09.166
than the squid
you're likely bringing right now.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.166
-Hmm.
-Your friend, Yennefer.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.958
You need to focus on your breath.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.083
From here. Okay?

04:19.666 --> 04:21.000
[sighs]

04:21.500 --> 04:23.041
[rustling]

04:23.125 --> 04:24.708
[seabirds calling]

04:26.708 --> 04:27.708
[Geralt] Not again.

04:32.666 --> 04:34.375
Ciri, Yennefer, we're leaving!

04:37.166 --> 04:38.041
[man 1] Quickly!

04:38.125 --> 04:39.000
[man 2] Stop!

04:40.250 --> 04:42.666
-[man 3] Quick, do that.
-[man 2] That side!

04:43.166 --> 04:44.541
[yells]

04:45.125 --> 04:47.958
Missed them again!
Where the fuck are they?

04:48.958 --> 04:50.041
Burn it all down!

04:50.958 --> 04:52.833
[dramatic music]

05:04.166 --> 05:06.041
[music intensifies]

05:14.500 --> 05:16.083
[calm music]

05:23.125 --> 05:24.625
[Geralt] For your discretion.

05:40.416 --> 05:41.666
[sighs]

05:47.708 --> 05:49.375
[lively music]

05:51.375 --> 05:53.375
[Ciri grunts] That was brilliant!

05:53.458 --> 05:55.166
-[Geralt groans]
-[Ciri laughs]

05:55.250 --> 05:57.166
[Yennefer] Dear friend, it seems that

05:57.250 --> 06:00.833
you and Ciri are thoroughly enjoying
our fourth house in as many months,

06:00.916 --> 06:03.208
finding time to bond so delightfully.

06:05.083 --> 06:09.666
I will remind you, though, that you asked,
nay, begged me to teach her magic.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.875
Please conserve her energy
so that I may properly do so.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.625
Also, less meat, more wine.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.291
-Yennefer.
-Hmm.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.125
[Yennefer] Success only comes
with repetition.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.583
[speaking in Elder]

06:24.666 --> 06:26.125
-[wind whistling]
-[rumbling]

06:36.666 --> 06:37.791
[speaking in Elder]

06:50.250 --> 06:52.416
[Yennefer] You can do it. Don't give up.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.666
[unsettling music]

07:10.875 --> 07:12.333
[horse snorts]

07:16.791 --> 07:18.333
[woman shouts] Stay together! Hurry up!

07:18.416 --> 07:20.125
[Yennefer] They're just villagers, Geralt.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.125
Let's go.

07:21.625 --> 07:22.958
[horse neighs]

07:25.958 --> 07:27.958
[adventurous music]

07:41.291 --> 07:43.291
[horses neighing]

07:44.041 --> 07:45.375
[wind whistling]

07:45.458 --> 07:46.875
[horse snorting]

07:49.583 --> 07:51.500
[wistful music]

08:08.708 --> 08:09.666
[Ciri] Yarpen!

08:09.750 --> 08:12.125
[Yarpen] You really wanna hide,
you'd dye that mop.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.958
No one's lookin'
for the Black fuckin' Wolf.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.583
-[Geralt] Hello, old friend.
-Don't break my shite!

08:16.666 --> 08:20.166
[chuckles]
And I expect payment for my discretion!

08:26.125 --> 08:27.375
[door closes]

08:39.833 --> 08:40.875
[sighs]

08:44.958 --> 08:46.125
[Yennefer] Dear friend,

08:46.208 --> 08:49.166
we're so far off the map here
that we may never leave again.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.875
-[Yennefer and Ciri] Ooh!
-[both laugh]

08:50.958 --> 08:52.541
[Yennefer] Come to think of it,

08:53.208 --> 08:54.916
would that be such a bad thing?

08:55.750 --> 08:58.833
We'll continue magic lessons
before the ice melts, I promise.

08:58.916 --> 09:01.458
But for now,
perhaps the girl deserves a break.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.916
-[sighs]
-[Yennefer] Perhaps you and I do too.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.166
[both laughing]

09:07.625 --> 09:09.958
-Your friend, Yennefer.
-[Ciri] Let's go again.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.750
-Again. Ready?
-[Yennefer laughs] Okay.

09:11.833 --> 09:13.166
-[Ciri] One foot…
-[both gasp]

09:14.125 --> 09:15.458
[both laughing]

09:24.583 --> 09:27.333
I can magically intuit
your thoughts, Geralt.

09:27.416 --> 09:30.625
You've been wanting to invite me
to dinner ever since we arrived.

09:31.375 --> 09:32.208
Have I?

09:32.291 --> 09:36.541
[chuckles] No. But I looked through
your window and you have more wine.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.500
And I'm begging for a refill.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.208
[light music]

09:53.875 --> 09:54.958
[Geralt] Hmm.

10:02.583 --> 10:03.458
[Ciri] Thank you.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.791
Just a bit of this.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.666
-Perfect.
-[Ciri laughs] Mmm!

10:15.541 --> 10:17.875
-[Ciri] That one was a masterpiece.
-[Yennefer] Right.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.625
-Made by chef Ciri.
-Open your mouth!

10:29.375 --> 10:31.416
Geralt's favorite food is radish.

10:33.666 --> 10:34.541
Ooh!

10:34.625 --> 10:37.333
We always made that, so at least once…

10:38.208 --> 10:39.416
[Ciri laughing]

10:39.500 --> 10:40.333
Wait--

10:40.916 --> 10:41.916
[Geralt] Thank you.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.208
-I'm going to go to bed now.
-Okay.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.166
-Good night.
-Good night.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.166
Uh. Well…

11:03.041 --> 11:04.208
[clears throat]

11:09.833 --> 11:10.708
Good night.

11:14.583 --> 11:15.791
[Geralt grunts]

11:18.625 --> 11:19.625
Good night.

11:28.041 --> 11:30.041
[ice creaking]

11:30.833 --> 11:32.875
[Ciri speaking in Elder]

11:32.958 --> 11:34.541
[splashing]

11:45.250 --> 11:46.333
[sighs heavily]

11:48.083 --> 11:49.375
Water magic is tricky.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.125
That's what you said
about earth magic, and air magic.

11:52.208 --> 11:54.375
Well, you have power
like nothing I've seen.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.750
Makes it hard for both of us.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.041
That's enough for today.

12:03.625 --> 12:06.541
Considering the mess I make
with every other kind of magic,

12:07.041 --> 12:09.166
how could fire magic be any worse?

12:11.750 --> 12:13.083
Remember Rience.

12:14.625 --> 12:17.500
That look in his eye.
There's always a source.

12:18.291 --> 12:20.125
With fire magic, the source is you.

12:20.791 --> 12:22.791
It takes something you never get back.

12:23.791 --> 12:24.833
Your magic?

12:26.083 --> 12:26.958
Yes.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.541
But magic isn't everything.

12:32.416 --> 12:34.041
You say magic isn't everything,

12:34.833 --> 12:37.041
but you were willing
to trade my life for it.

12:37.708 --> 12:40.791
You almost lost me to Voleth Meir.
You almost lost Geralt.

12:40.875 --> 12:41.916
-It was…
-I know.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.083
Well, if you knew, why did you do it?

12:46.750 --> 12:48.166
Because… I'd given up.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.750
But I'll never make that mistake again.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.125
-[wheels rumbling]
-[horse neighing]

13:03.000 --> 13:06.208
[Yarpen] Wish I had more for you,
but the Squirrels hit Henselt's convoy.

13:07.791 --> 13:10.500
Look at these.
Potatoes the size of gnome nuts.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.750
Did they attack your convoy as well?

13:12.833 --> 13:15.791
[scoffs] I'd like
to see them fuckin' try it!

13:15.875 --> 13:18.500
The elves' gripe is with the kings,
not us.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.583
They're just trying to soften the North
for the grand cock of Nilfgaard.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.541
Nilfgaard gave elves refuge,
and now they're fighting on their behalf.

13:26.625 --> 13:29.541
Amazing what people will do
when you give them a second chance.

13:34.625 --> 13:35.583
Hold on.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.375
Hold on!

13:37.958 --> 13:39.250
Are you two fuckin' again?

13:40.166 --> 13:41.666
Subtle, Yarpen.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.125
[Yarpen laughs] Who would blame you?

13:44.208 --> 13:45.750
Spring's almost here.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.916
Ah, the whole world's wakin' up.

13:48.583 --> 13:51.541
Our Belleteyn festival is just
down the valley. You should come.

13:51.625 --> 13:52.583
I'd love to.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.125
-It's not safe.
-Bad idea.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.083
-[Ciri] No one's asked about me in months.
-[sighs]

13:57.166 --> 13:59.083
And everyone will be in costume.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.541
And… I was born on Belleteyn.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.416
[Yarpen] Ah! You'd have had a shot
at bein' May Queen.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.500
Except my niece's beard
is comin' in nice and full this year.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.291
-[laughs]
-[Geralt hisses]

14:12.500 --> 14:13.833
Just say yes, already!

14:14.541 --> 14:17.166
About time for a fuckin' thaw round here.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.541
[Ciri] I promise I'll be safe.

14:21.458 --> 14:22.500
[sighs]

14:23.666 --> 14:25.625
[growling and moaning]

14:26.791 --> 14:28.333
[deep rumbling]

14:28.416 --> 14:30.458
[snarling]

14:42.041 --> 14:43.625
-[roaring]
-[man 1 yelps]

14:43.708 --> 14:45.708
-[growling]
-[laughing]

14:54.375 --> 14:56.875
Now see how you like my new pet.

14:56.958 --> 14:58.458
-[groans]
-[man 2 laughs]

14:58.541 --> 15:00.291
[loud screeching]

15:00.375 --> 15:02.750
-[thumping and screeching]
-[man 2 laughing]

15:06.750 --> 15:08.750
-Hmm!
-What is that thing?

15:08.833 --> 15:10.708
-[laughs]
-[creature snarls]

15:10.791 --> 15:13.708
I should have warned you before,
you elven mutt.

15:14.333 --> 15:18.500
That jackapace is trained
to smell your kind from a league away.

15:18.583 --> 15:19.541
[whooshing]

15:19.625 --> 15:21.750
[Rience] Then I've come
to the right place.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.041
-[jackapace screeches]
-[man 2] Show yourself.

15:24.625 --> 15:28.041
-Or I open that and you can be its dinner.
-[footsteps approaching]

15:29.666 --> 15:30.583
[fingers snap]

15:31.625 --> 15:34.000
I need to find a girl with elven blood.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.416
All my jacky needs is a scent.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.625
Lock of hair, piece of clothin'…
[chuckles]

15:40.708 --> 15:42.166
I'll do you one better.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.375
[jackapace roars]

15:47.458 --> 15:49.416
Put that fucking thing away.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
[banging and screeching]

15:56.083 --> 15:57.041
How much?

15:59.916 --> 16:01.916
-[sheep bleats]
-[elf calls softly]

16:08.833 --> 16:10.916
[distant horse neighs]

16:11.000 --> 16:14.166
Gage, take your best fighters
and head west to Maribor.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.083
Filavandrel, take yours south to Caed Dhu.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.125
She is out there.

16:19.833 --> 16:22.958
Have there been sightings,
or are we chasing more rumors?

16:23.041 --> 16:24.208
We don't know

16:25.458 --> 16:26.958
if Cirilla has Elder Blood.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.791
We're basing it all
on the words of…

16:29.541 --> 16:32.958
of some mage
who came and went just as fast.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.708
You have your orders.

16:41.416 --> 16:44.750
I want to kill them all
for what they have done to your child.

16:45.708 --> 16:46.666
Our hope.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.250
But, sister, it is not enough.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.458
My aim has not wavered.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.708
I will find Dol Blathanna.

16:55.791 --> 16:59.916
But how? Where?
There is no sanctuary left for elves here.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.958
All will become clear
once we have Cirilla. She is our new hope.

17:04.875 --> 17:05.958
Do you doubt me?

17:06.458 --> 17:09.041
-[elfyn] Wake up! Hurry!
-[elf] Move the carts out!

17:09.125 --> 17:10.750
The others are starting to.

17:10.833 --> 17:13.875
Gallatin and the Scoia'tael, they're back!

17:14.541 --> 17:16.416
-It's not good.
-[elf] We need help!

17:16.500 --> 17:17.708
-[sighs]
-[horses neighing]

17:17.791 --> 17:18.666
[elf] Get the healer.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.541
-[elf] I need help!
-[elfyn] Help!

17:21.291 --> 17:23.041
[screaming and groaning]

17:27.375 --> 17:29.708
He doesn't need you to play nursemaid.

17:29.791 --> 17:31.500
He needs you to play soldier.

17:31.583 --> 17:32.833
[elf coughing]

17:32.916 --> 17:34.958
[elfyn sobbing]

17:35.875 --> 17:36.750
[Gallatin] Fuck.

17:36.833 --> 17:38.583
[elfyn] Leave it! It's spent.

17:38.666 --> 17:39.625
Needed.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.375
Let me know if you plan
to start holding weapons back next,

17:47.458 --> 17:50.041
leaving unarmed Squirrels
to fight for our freedom.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.916
I told you. I've given you
all the fighters I can spare.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.791
We both know that's bullshit.

17:54.875 --> 17:56.916
Your best fighters
are running secret missions

17:57.000 --> 18:00.166
to who the fuck knows where,
while the rest of us are out there,

18:00.250 --> 18:02.416
following orders, attacking convoys,

18:02.500 --> 18:04.666
doing the work to get our land back.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.875
Doing the bidding
of yet another self-important human.

18:07.958 --> 18:10.750
You think I give a shit
about that White Flame nonsense?

18:10.833 --> 18:15.000
I give a shit about food in my stomach
and a place to call home.

18:15.083 --> 18:19.000
I have plans, and they don't involve dying
in the woods because of your selfishness.

18:19.083 --> 18:22.375
-Plans with Nilfgaard?
-What don't you get?

18:22.458 --> 18:26.333
If Nilfgaard takes the North,
elves are free everywhere.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.083
The whole Continent is our Dol Blathanna.

18:29.166 --> 18:32.000
We tried sharing the Continent
for centuries.

18:33.041 --> 18:37.125
If there's to be another genocide,
this time, it'll be the humans'.

18:41.125 --> 18:45.125
You keep spouting off
about ancient times, prophecies.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.500
I don't know
what you're looking for out there.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.625
But you want to keep elves alive?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Here we are.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.333
[horse neighs]

18:56.250 --> 18:57.416
[elfyn wails]

19:00.750 --> 19:03.041
[music and conversation]

19:03.125 --> 19:06.458
-[laughter]
-[Vizimir] You promised me a princess.

19:06.541 --> 19:10.166
Now every king knows about her,
thanks to Tissaia de Vries.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.625
It's not a good look, Dijkstra.
You swore Cirilla would be mine.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.083
Perhaps a tad quieter, your Highness.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.625
We wouldn't want your beloved
to catch wind.

19:24.416 --> 19:26.916
Being the king used to mean something.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.500
It's been six months.
What have you got to show for it?

19:29.583 --> 19:31.250
Excuses, expenses,

19:31.333 --> 19:34.166
but no sign of the new princess
you wanted me to marry.

19:34.666 --> 19:37.750
Sir, our attention has been diverted
because of the Squirrels.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.166
Oh, yet more excuses.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.416
Don't even get me started
on those bastards.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.000
Blaming us for murdering
that stupid elven baby. [scoffs]

19:46.125 --> 19:47.666
That definitely wasn't us?

19:50.875 --> 19:53.875
You have the North's largest army
and spy network.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.500
We are the most feared kingdom
of the North.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.500
What do I have to show for it? [scoffs]

19:59.583 --> 20:01.833
A spy master who can't find one girl.

20:01.916 --> 20:04.083
No. It's time for a change.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.625
[sniffs] I've decided
to put my best person on it.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.125
Someone who I can trust.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.750
Radovid!

20:11.333 --> 20:12.291
-What's that?
-[pop]

20:12.375 --> 20:13.750
-[woman shrieks]
-[cheering]

20:13.833 --> 20:14.708
Whoo!

20:17.833 --> 20:18.875
Oh.

20:22.291 --> 20:24.375
[Philippa] The king's baby brother?

20:26.041 --> 20:29.041
Now we have to chaperone
that royal seed-waste too?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.750
[Dijkstra] No, it's all for show.

20:32.250 --> 20:35.291
Vizimir just needs to remind everyone
who wears the crown.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.208
He wears it thanks to us.

20:39.666 --> 20:42.000
By gods, we've been doing this
too long, Dijkstra.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.333
[chuckles] There's no such thing.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.750
Our alliance, however old,

20:47.916 --> 20:48.916
keeps us young.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.958
Now, as for Prince Seed-waste,

20:54.833 --> 20:56.250
boulder, parchment, dagger.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.458
Absolutely not.

20:58.541 --> 21:01.875
I was the one who seduced
the Lyrian baroness last month,

21:01.958 --> 21:04.500
and the only secret she was hiding
was syphilis.

21:04.583 --> 21:08.416
And that's worse than the week I spent
perched over a shit-filled moat in Temeria

21:08.500 --> 21:10.375
while they debated timber prices?

21:13.458 --> 21:14.333
Fair.

21:15.916 --> 21:19.208
Perhaps I can order someone to babysit
the prince while he looks for the girl.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.708
Mmm. We don't trust anyone else.

21:27.750 --> 21:28.833
Hmm.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.291
If I do this…

21:34.375 --> 21:37.375
I'll be the only one giving orders
when I get back.

21:52.166 --> 21:55.750
[Ciri] I've never been to a Belleteyn
festival outside of Cintra before.

21:56.541 --> 22:00.916
You know, this one year, Sir Lazlo tried
to jump the bonfire in full armor.

22:04.458 --> 22:05.541
What do you think?

22:07.833 --> 22:11.083
[sighs] I think you need to hide your hair
and mask your eyes.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.916
Would it kill you to say,
"You look lovely"?

22:17.166 --> 22:18.208
Ciri.

22:21.291 --> 22:23.000
I knew this was a bad idea.

22:37.583 --> 22:38.708
You look lovely.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.625
[thrilling music]

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
[cheering]

23:01.208 --> 23:02.708
[crowd cheers]

23:03.791 --> 23:05.250
[crowd] Whoa!

23:09.291 --> 23:11.833
-Stay close.
-Should we, uh, find the ale tent?

23:14.875 --> 23:16.041
Read my mind.

23:17.041 --> 23:18.958
[Ciri] Cods, I've missed this.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.041
-I'm going dancing.
-[Yennefer] Be safe.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.875
[lively folk music]

23:23.958 --> 23:25.500
[laughter]

23:26.791 --> 23:30.166
[Yennefer] Look at what happens
when we let her have one good night.

23:30.750 --> 23:34.375
Let's not pretend your motivations
aren't entirely unselfish, Yennefer.

23:35.708 --> 23:37.208
[man] Play "Old Times"!

23:38.250 --> 23:40.166
Happy birthday to you too.

23:43.541 --> 23:44.833
You remembered.

23:44.916 --> 23:46.416
I don't forget much.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.791
So you remember our good nights.

23:51.916 --> 23:53.125
After the djinn.

23:56.708 --> 23:58.291
The library in Kovir.

23:58.375 --> 23:59.416
[laughs]

24:00.708 --> 24:02.333
So much for staying quiet.

24:04.875 --> 24:05.875
The farmhouse.

24:06.750 --> 24:07.750
In Murivel.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.666
The overnight carriage ride
from Ellander to Moën.

24:14.708 --> 24:15.916
And the ride back.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.375
Don't forget the ride back.

24:19.458 --> 24:23.125
[Yennefer] How could I? That would be like
forgetting our night in Caingorn.

24:23.208 --> 24:24.208
Ah!

24:24.958 --> 24:26.250
That dragon hunt.

24:28.916 --> 24:30.583
Those nights were amazing.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.541
-But the mornings…
-They were lonely.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.250
You often left before dawn.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.041
Or you did.

24:42.708 --> 24:44.708
I know why I left, but why did you?

24:47.375 --> 24:49.541
Scared of what would happen
if we really tried?

24:57.166 --> 24:59.583
I was unsure
if it was actually what I wanted.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.708
Not just some trick of the djinn's magic.

25:06.708 --> 25:07.625
And now?

25:09.916 --> 25:11.333
[Ciri] Let's go in the maze!

25:12.875 --> 25:13.791
Come on!

25:21.625 --> 25:22.458
Come on!

25:26.958 --> 25:28.958
[folk music continues in distance]

25:32.583 --> 25:34.041
[women laugh]

25:39.666 --> 25:41.000
[couple laughing]

25:41.083 --> 25:42.666
[folk music fades]

25:42.750 --> 25:44.833
[plangent music]

25:52.291 --> 25:53.333
[Geralt grunts]

26:12.708 --> 26:13.916
[rumbling]

26:18.708 --> 26:20.125
[distant laughter]

26:25.833 --> 26:26.833
[laughs]

26:26.916 --> 26:28.166
[women screaming]

26:28.250 --> 26:29.750
-Run!
-Run!

26:29.833 --> 26:30.916
Ciri.

26:33.666 --> 26:34.666
[Geralt] Ciri!

26:35.833 --> 26:36.666
[Yennefer] Ciri!

26:37.583 --> 26:38.500
[Geralt] Ciri!

26:41.625 --> 26:42.500
[Yennefer] Ciri!

26:43.875 --> 26:44.916
[Ciri] Yennefer!

26:46.500 --> 26:47.333
Geralt!

26:51.916 --> 26:52.833
Geralt!

26:53.333 --> 26:54.375
Yennefer!

26:54.458 --> 26:55.708
[rumbling]

26:57.541 --> 26:58.583
[sniffing]

26:59.750 --> 27:01.500
[snorting]

27:18.375 --> 27:19.833
[screeches]

27:27.333 --> 27:28.208
[speaking in Elder]

27:33.333 --> 27:34.541
[speaking in Elder]

27:42.625 --> 27:44.250
[jackapace screeches]

27:46.750 --> 27:48.750
-[grunts]
-[Ciri] Geralt!

28:03.666 --> 28:05.083
[squelching]

28:14.250 --> 28:16.583
-We'll find another home.
-I liked this one.

28:17.458 --> 28:18.291
We all did.

28:19.916 --> 28:23.083
-How did that thing find us?
-[Geralt] A jackapace hunts by scent.

28:23.666 --> 28:26.750
-It found Ciri because it knew her.
-Her scent? How?

28:26.833 --> 28:29.833
Vesemir told me that Rience
stole Ciri's blood from Kaer Morhen.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.833
He must have used the blood
as a scent marker.

28:32.916 --> 28:34.875
[Yennefer] So wherever we go,
he'll find us?

28:34.958 --> 28:37.458
[Geralt] Yes. Unless we find him first.

28:37.541 --> 28:38.583
We draw him out.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.125
We give him the thing he wants most.

28:44.916 --> 28:45.833
Me.

28:47.750 --> 28:52.083
[Yarpen] Look, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have
invited you if I knew it weren't safe.

28:52.166 --> 28:55.625
We know. But now you can make it up to us.

28:55.708 --> 28:57.791
You have a caravan leaving tomorrow,
don't you?

28:57.875 --> 29:00.166
-Aye. To Hagge.
-I want to go with you.

29:00.250 --> 29:02.125
-By yourself?
-[Yennefer] Not quite.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.541
We'll be there too.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.458
[Ciri] But it's important
no one knows that.

29:06.541 --> 29:09.458
-Or else this plan isn't going to work.
-[chuckles]

29:10.041 --> 29:12.750
Count me in. Tell me what I need to do.

29:12.833 --> 29:16.708
[Geralt] There's only one monster handler
reckless enough to cage a jackapace.

29:16.791 --> 29:19.125
-[yells]
-[Geralt] Name's Veldhoek.

29:19.208 --> 29:21.875
-Oh…
-[Geralt] Nasty fellow with a nasty habit.

29:22.583 --> 29:24.625
[Ciri] Rience hired Veldhoek to find me.

29:24.708 --> 29:26.666
Now they'll want
to hear about your convoy.

29:26.750 --> 29:27.791
[yells]

29:28.375 --> 29:30.833
[Yennefer] We need you to complain
about the spoilt brat

29:30.916 --> 29:32.458
who ruined Belleteyn for everyone.

29:32.541 --> 29:36.041
And what's worse, now I have to haul
that ivy-eyed brat's pale arse

29:36.125 --> 29:38.166
all the way to Aedirn with my caravan.

29:38.666 --> 29:42.083
Gonna charge them double if I have to
put up with any of her yappery.

29:45.375 --> 29:46.875
Come on, you elven mutt.

29:49.291 --> 29:51.083
[Ciri] They'll know
who you're talking about.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.375
[creature growling]

29:53.458 --> 29:55.500
[Ciri] And how much
that information is worth.

29:55.583 --> 29:58.041
-[Rience] Enjoy your reward.
-[Yarpen] Hold up, buttercup.

29:58.125 --> 30:01.875
You think this mage is gonna believe
you'd let Ciri ride without an escort?

30:01.958 --> 30:04.250
She'll be traveling with someone we trust.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.458
Someone…

30:06.166 --> 30:07.541
seemingly innocuous.

30:08.375 --> 30:10.166
Oh, come on! No…

30:10.250 --> 30:12.458
-[woman grunts]
-[yelps] It was one time!

30:12.541 --> 30:15.083
Admittedly, with many different people.

30:15.166 --> 30:16.708
And it meant nothing!

30:16.791 --> 30:19.708
I mean, these aren't even mine!

30:19.791 --> 30:23.208
Did you think you were the only one
having some fun on the side,

30:23.291 --> 30:26.000
you lying, wretched son of the devil?

30:26.750 --> 30:27.625
Well…

30:28.458 --> 30:30.375
yeah, kinda! [yelps]

30:31.125 --> 30:34.916
This is what we do, my sweet.
We are creatives.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.916
Freethinkers.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.958
-All is fair!
-Is it, though?

30:39.041 --> 30:40.166
Ah! Oh!

30:40.250 --> 30:45.375
Ooh! When will magic, sexy women
just stop jumping out at me?

30:45.458 --> 30:47.333
Usually it's you coming at me from above.

30:47.416 --> 30:49.583
-She doesn't have a crossbow, does she?
-No!

30:51.083 --> 30:53.208
Possibly. Yeah, no,
I wouldn't rule it out.

30:53.291 --> 30:54.500
No crossbows!

30:54.583 --> 30:56.500
And you can fuckin' have him!

30:56.583 --> 30:58.208
And his pox-marked cock!

30:58.291 --> 31:00.250
Now who's lying, Vespula?

31:00.333 --> 31:02.958
We've lost patience, Sandpiper.

31:03.833 --> 31:07.333
-I-- I'm doing everything that I can. I--
-You're doing nothing.

31:07.416 --> 31:09.250
Except fucking people over.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.000
We invested a lot in your operations.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.958
-And we've gotten nothing in return.
-[whimpers]

31:17.500 --> 31:20.125
Dijkstra and I are ready to cut you loose.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.833
-But King Vizimir is more forgiving.
-[winces]

31:23.916 --> 31:26.791
He's ready to welcome the girl
with open arms. Shall we?

31:27.291 --> 31:29.458
Yeah, and an open pair of pantaloons.

31:29.541 --> 31:30.791
Yeah-- Uh, no, darling--

31:30.875 --> 31:32.291
No! Look at me.

31:32.375 --> 31:35.833
Look at my eyes.
There is no need to harm the innocent!

31:35.916 --> 31:36.958
No, no, no, don't!

31:37.041 --> 31:38.000
No--

31:40.916 --> 31:44.500
I thought I left you cradling
a pint of ale some distance away.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.458
-You did. I got bored.
-Hmm. Oh.

31:49.666 --> 31:53.625
How fortunate that is.
I've long wanted to see you in person.

31:55.041 --> 31:56.708
"Song of the Seven" is my favorite.

31:56.791 --> 31:59.833
Yeah. That's… slightly ironic,
but thank you.

31:59.916 --> 32:01.666
You see? People like me.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.791
I've got fans.
Sorry, I didn't quite catch your name.

32:04.875 --> 32:06.083
-Uh, Radovid.
-Right.

32:06.166 --> 32:07.000
Comma, Prince.

32:07.583 --> 32:10.208
Comma, wow. Whoa-- wow. You're…

32:10.291 --> 32:13.541
Ooh! The Prince of Redania.

32:13.625 --> 32:16.208
Fuck, I don't really know
what I'm supposed to… Bow?

32:16.291 --> 32:19.375
Or curtsy, or… Been holding your hand
a very long time. I'm so sorry.

32:19.458 --> 32:23.000
Listen, I wish I could help you, truly.
But--

32:23.083 --> 32:25.916
-But nothing, Sandpiper--
-If I may offer a thought.

32:26.416 --> 32:29.750
Ah, this poor Cirilla girl
has enemies everywhere,

32:29.833 --> 32:33.083
and, truth be told,
Redania's not a bad place.

32:33.875 --> 32:36.208
Bit cold in the winter
and humid in the summer,

32:36.291 --> 32:38.500
but the food is spectacular.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.708
And my brother's not bad.

32:41.416 --> 32:42.500
As monarchs go.

32:44.916 --> 32:48.291
Redania may not be perfect,
but it's her least bad option.

32:50.250 --> 32:52.291
-You could be our royal bard.
-[laughs]

32:52.375 --> 32:53.375
Uh… Ha, ha!

32:53.458 --> 32:57.333
No. No, a staid life at court
is not for me.

32:57.416 --> 33:00.541
If your time at court's been staid,
you've been doing it wrong.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.791
Either deliver the girl,

33:06.875 --> 33:09.750
or we will single-handedly undo

33:09.833 --> 33:12.583
every good deed
you have done for the elves.

33:14.625 --> 33:15.750
We will kill them all.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.541
-Yeah, yeah, I got the gist.
-Mmm.

33:18.458 --> 33:21.500
I've got business in town
before we portal back to Tretogor.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.166
-You… have five days.
-[gulps]

33:31.958 --> 33:34.541
-[Yarpen] Oi, you lute-playin' walloper!
-[sighs]

33:35.125 --> 33:38.000
Again with this fresh hell…

33:38.083 --> 33:40.166
Mr. Zigrin! [chuckles]

33:43.000 --> 33:45.375
-Julian Alfred Pankratz.
-Yeah, I know. I know.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.125
I fucking know!

33:47.208 --> 33:49.625
I know you know. It's a rule of threes
thing. Has to be done.

33:49.708 --> 33:51.208
What can I do for you, Yarpen?

33:51.291 --> 33:54.125
I've got ears and good taste, so… nothin'.

33:55.291 --> 33:57.958
But… your friends need help.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.500
[sighs] Of course they do.

34:05.458 --> 34:07.208
-[horses neighing]
-[Jaskier] Bait!

34:07.750 --> 34:09.708
I rode for days to get here,

34:09.791 --> 34:11.791
battling hunger, battling the elements,

34:11.875 --> 34:15.291
only to discover upon my arrival
that I'm being used as--

34:15.375 --> 34:16.375
-Jaskier, me.
-…bait.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.750
I am the bait. Rience is after me.

34:18.833 --> 34:22.791
Yes, which means he wants you alive,
and me very much not alive.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.000
You see my anxiety?

34:24.583 --> 34:26.666
We're not gonna let
anything happen to you.

34:26.750 --> 34:29.416
I saved your arse once.
I can do it again, Pankratz.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.666
You didn't save me--

34:31.750 --> 34:34.375
-She didn't save me. She…
-[horse snorting]

34:34.458 --> 34:35.500
She didn't!

34:36.583 --> 34:38.583
But seriously,
you are gonna save me, right?

34:39.333 --> 34:41.250
We won't make Hagge by sunset.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.083
We should make camp here.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.041
[dwarves shouting]

34:48.541 --> 34:50.541
[epic music]

35:09.125 --> 35:10.458
[Ciri] What is this place?

35:11.083 --> 35:12.416
[Geralt] It's Shaerrawedd.

35:12.916 --> 35:16.000
[Yennefer] Tread lightly.
This land is full of stories.

35:17.208 --> 35:20.083
Never seen
so many wild roses in one place.

35:21.208 --> 35:22.333
They're beautiful.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.250
Their story, sadly, is not.

35:27.666 --> 35:28.750
Aelirenn.

35:29.875 --> 35:33.625
A brave and inspiring elven warrior
who thought she could defeat the humans.

35:35.583 --> 35:36.625
She was wrong.

35:37.458 --> 35:39.958
A rather condensed version of the story.

35:42.041 --> 35:43.541
[Ciri] And what's yours, then?

35:44.708 --> 35:47.458
After the Conjunction, humans arrived.

35:48.750 --> 35:52.041
The elves thought
the humans were just a nuisance,

35:52.708 --> 35:54.750
like a plague of locusts or a drought.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.875
That they would die off
in the blink of an elven eye.

35:58.791 --> 36:00.833
But the humans kept multiplying.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.041
And killing.

36:05.708 --> 36:08.041
Aelirenn knew
the threat wasn't going away.

36:08.916 --> 36:12.916
So she rallied all of the young elves
to fight, at Shaerrawedd.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.416
Sounds like she fought
for what she believed in.

36:19.333 --> 36:20.500
To protect her people.

36:21.250 --> 36:23.625
[Geralt] She did fight
for what she believed in.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.916
She led those young
and passionate elves to war.

36:29.375 --> 36:30.916
They revered this place.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.125
This is where they fought.

36:35.083 --> 36:36.333
They fought for her.

36:36.833 --> 36:40.791
And they died with her name on their lips
and their honor and integrity intact.

36:43.375 --> 36:46.500
And in doing so, they condemned
their species to annihilation.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.375
She led them all to their deaths.

36:54.375 --> 36:55.875
Neutrality. [sighs]

36:55.958 --> 36:57.583
It won't get you a statue.

36:58.666 --> 37:01.125
But it'll certainly help
in keeping you alive.

37:11.041 --> 37:13.083
-[elf 1] And fight!
-[elf 2] Weak humans!

37:14.041 --> 37:16.500
-[elfyn] Ahh! That'll teach them!
-[elf 2] Yeah!

37:16.583 --> 37:19.708
[Gallatin] When will the humans learn
to travel with more guards?

37:19.791 --> 37:21.833
-[elf 3] How many men did you kill?
-Eat.

37:21.916 --> 37:23.708
-[elf 3] Here they are.
-Here.

37:23.791 --> 37:26.125
Got to fatten you up.
Need you back out there.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.000
-[elf 4] Well done, brother.
-Here.

37:29.583 --> 37:30.500
Eat.

37:33.666 --> 37:37.000
-Food goes to the ones who fought.
-We fight just like you.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.500
Then eat what you captured.

37:38.583 --> 37:41.041
All elves share equally.

37:41.666 --> 37:43.791
Otherwise,
we're no better than the humans.

37:51.958 --> 37:54.500
All elves must risk equally, as well.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.041
You were right.

37:58.125 --> 38:01.083
Our Scoia'tael forces should be united.

38:01.791 --> 38:02.875
In purpose,

38:03.500 --> 38:04.500
but also in action.

38:05.291 --> 38:07.166
Must've been an eventful morning.

38:07.666 --> 38:09.750
What did you see out there
to change your mind?

38:09.833 --> 38:13.750
[Francesca] Nothing. I simply had time
to consider your position.

38:15.041 --> 38:17.916
We have different ideas
of what Dol Blathanna looks like.

38:18.625 --> 38:19.916
But we both want a home.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.500
And we can find it faster together.

38:31.291 --> 38:33.583
You should get out of that tent
more often.

38:33.666 --> 38:34.708
Hmm.

38:36.208 --> 38:38.500
Tomorrow, we make our next move.

38:39.916 --> 38:42.375
I'll be by your side. As long as it takes.

38:52.958 --> 38:54.958
[birdsong]

38:58.416 --> 38:59.875
[sighs softly]

39:06.250 --> 39:08.000
-Ciri!
-Ciri.

39:08.083 --> 39:10.500
You two really think
I'm that shitty of a guard?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.291
I had another dream.

39:18.416 --> 39:19.541
[Geralt] A nightmare?

39:20.875 --> 39:22.541
No, it wasn't frightening.

39:23.041 --> 39:25.583
Just couldn't sleep
thinking about Aelirenn.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.208
And my grandmother.

39:28.041 --> 39:29.583
They lived centuries apart,

39:29.666 --> 39:31.666
but burned with the exact same mission.

39:34.541 --> 39:36.750
Wipe the other species off the Continent.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.541
[sighs]

39:46.166 --> 39:47.791
When I finally fell asleep,

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
it came to me.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.708
If I can offer something different…

39:58.208 --> 40:01.375
A way forward that doesn't divide,
but unites.

40:02.958 --> 40:04.875
I'm part elf, I'm part human.

40:04.958 --> 40:08.750
I understand both because I am both,
and that is my strength.

40:09.250 --> 40:11.333
I understand what you're saying.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.750
History, it… [sighs]

40:15.916 --> 40:17.708
…has a way of repeating itself.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.125
Even for the idealistic.

40:20.208 --> 40:24.000
You say Aelirenn's idealism is what led
to the massacre of the young elves,

40:24.083 --> 40:28.375
but maybe if her elders had supported her
instead of abandoning her,

40:28.458 --> 40:29.375
they could've won.

40:31.041 --> 40:34.250
Yen, you overheard something
when you were taken prisoner by the elves.

40:34.333 --> 40:36.125
You told me they had a saying.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.541
[speaking in Elder]

40:42.208 --> 40:44.250
What has been need not always be.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.625
Francesca, the elven queen,

40:48.333 --> 40:51.000
she believed she could offer
something more to her people.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.708
And so do I.

40:54.625 --> 40:58.458
Geralt, you taught me how to fight.
Just like Calanthe.

40:58.541 --> 41:02.250
And Yen, you're teaching me how
to harness my powers. Like Mousesack.

41:03.083 --> 41:06.291
What if this is the reason
destiny brought us together?

41:08.125 --> 41:11.625
Nenneke said I have the power
to change the cycle of hatred.

41:12.791 --> 41:14.000
And I want to.

41:15.791 --> 41:19.333
To be the balance between kings and mages,
and to align the Continent,

41:19.416 --> 41:22.333
instead of constantly pitting parts
against each other.

41:22.875 --> 41:27.041
Because I am sick and tired
of destruction and loss.

41:32.125 --> 41:33.833
I don't doubt you, Ciri.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.458
I do doubt the world, though.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.916
-It--
-[low rumbling]

41:46.291 --> 41:48.041
Let's go. Now.

41:53.083 --> 41:54.666
[Yennefer] We'll be right here.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Are you ready?

42:10.625 --> 42:13.833
-[Yennefer] How long do we wait?
-[Geralt] Until she draws them out.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.333
-[sighs shakily]
-She can do this.

42:20.916 --> 42:22.541
[thudding steps]

42:27.833 --> 42:29.416
[Rience] Cirilla of Cintra.

42:31.125 --> 42:32.500
Alone at last.

42:33.458 --> 42:36.916
Well, not quite.
I've brought more friends this time.

42:45.166 --> 42:46.166
[yells]

42:52.750 --> 42:56.708
Last time, I beat you with my wits.
This time, you meet my magic.

43:12.541 --> 43:14.333
-[man 1] With me!
-[man 2] Get in there, lads!

43:14.416 --> 43:15.625
I like my odds.

43:16.166 --> 43:17.666
[Yarpen] I like our odds better!

43:17.750 --> 43:19.666
[dwarves yelling]

43:22.291 --> 43:23.625
This is too easy!

43:29.583 --> 43:30.958
-[Yennefer] Geralt!
-[grunts]

43:31.041 --> 43:31.875
[Rience] Fuck!

43:33.208 --> 43:34.458
Go!

43:54.291 --> 43:55.416
[Ciri] Can you keep it open?

43:55.500 --> 43:57.166
Some new strain of Chaotic insanity.

43:58.291 --> 44:01.166
But I will.
We just need to wait for Geralt.

44:02.083 --> 44:04.291
[Yarpen] Archers! Get down!

44:14.041 --> 44:16.875
-Where the fuck is the caravan?
-She's all that matters.

44:23.750 --> 44:26.708
-You have your orders. Go.
-What?

44:27.291 --> 44:28.208
Shit!

44:37.708 --> 44:38.708
[Ciri] Keep it open.

44:38.791 --> 44:40.166
-[elf 1] Follow me!
-[elf 2] Right!

44:44.416 --> 44:45.416
[yelling]

44:50.583 --> 44:51.666
[screaming]

44:51.750 --> 44:53.291
You don't look so special.

44:53.916 --> 44:55.250
[dwarf 1] Motherfucker!

44:58.125 --> 44:59.625
You bastard!

45:02.083 --> 45:03.916
-[Yarpen] Move!
-[Jaskier] Come on.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.833
Come on, I got you. I got you.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.791
You call yourself an elf.

45:12.291 --> 45:14.125
She's Hen Ichaer.

45:14.208 --> 45:15.833
-And she belongs with--
-Me!

45:15.916 --> 45:17.708
-[roaring sound]
-[Francesca yells]

45:19.375 --> 45:21.500
[Filavandrel] We need to
get her out of here!

45:21.583 --> 45:22.791
Come on, Geralt.

45:25.250 --> 45:27.375
[voices whispering in Elder]

45:28.708 --> 45:30.375
[Rience] Your mage is out of her depth.

45:43.291 --> 45:44.250
[screams]

45:50.958 --> 45:52.958
[yelling and screaming]

45:53.041 --> 45:55.583
[Yennefer grunts] The elves came for Ciri.

45:58.958 --> 46:00.000
[Yarpen] This way!

46:01.291 --> 46:02.500
[elf 1] Move!

46:32.791 --> 46:34.583
[elf 2] Come on. She could be in here!

46:34.666 --> 46:35.750
[elf 3] You two, with me!

46:41.375 --> 46:43.791
[Yarpen] You're gonna fuckin' die,
Squirrels!

46:43.875 --> 46:45.666
Go. Fall back.

46:45.750 --> 46:47.583
-Fall back!
-Fall back!

46:47.666 --> 46:49.333
-Fall back! Quick!
-Follow me!

46:49.416 --> 46:51.375
Come on, come on. Wake up.
Come on, get up.

46:56.083 --> 46:57.208
Oh!

46:57.291 --> 46:58.250
Oh, ho-ho!

47:00.875 --> 47:02.500
I've got her! I've got her!

47:05.500 --> 47:06.583
[Francesca] No! No!

47:06.666 --> 47:07.750
[screams] No!

47:08.291 --> 47:09.166
We have to go.

47:09.250 --> 47:10.791
-[elf] Fall back!
-[Ciri] Careful.

47:10.875 --> 47:12.333
[Jaskier moans]

47:12.416 --> 47:16.250
Oh, if I die, promise me
Valdo Marx will not play at my funeral.

47:17.083 --> 47:18.041
[Geralt] You'll be fine.

47:19.125 --> 47:20.875
Your lute, on the other hand,

47:21.541 --> 47:22.875
has seen better days.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.958
[Yarpen] You helped my men.

47:25.541 --> 47:27.583
-[strings resonate]
-You have my thanks.

47:28.500 --> 47:29.625
Jaskier.

47:30.500 --> 47:33.708
-You're the bravest bait that ever lived.
-[chuckles] Whew!

47:34.375 --> 47:36.666
-[dwarf laughs] You owe me one!
[Jaskier groans]

47:37.250 --> 47:39.500
Promise me we will never do that again.

47:40.583 --> 47:43.083
-[breathing heavily]
-Thank you, Jaskier.

47:43.166 --> 47:45.166
[mournful music]

47:51.083 --> 47:54.416
[Geralt] You said the portal was different
from anything you've experienced.

47:55.791 --> 47:58.500
-What did you mean?
-[Yennefer] It was dark.

47:59.583 --> 48:00.666
It took me over.

48:02.875 --> 48:04.708
I can still feel its residue.

48:05.666 --> 48:08.250
Rience isn't the only rogue mage
we're dealing with.

48:09.250 --> 48:11.041
Someone very powerful is puppeting him.

48:11.875 --> 48:14.208
You need to make more progress
with Ciri's training.

48:14.291 --> 48:15.916
-Mmm--
-I'll work harder.

48:16.500 --> 48:18.166
It's not about what you can do.

48:18.958 --> 48:21.208
It's about what I can do. I need help.

48:21.708 --> 48:23.750
-If I can talk to Tissaia--
-No.

48:25.708 --> 48:29.541
You don't know how difficult it is
to embody power but not have access to it.

48:29.625 --> 48:31.750
Going to Aretuza
cannot be the only answer.

48:31.833 --> 48:33.625
It's the best thing for her.

48:33.708 --> 48:34.708
Is it?

48:37.041 --> 48:38.583
Come with us, then.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.458
Stay and make sure she's safe.

48:41.875 --> 48:43.291
[Ciri] All I want

48:44.666 --> 48:46.416
is for us to stay together.

48:50.791 --> 48:52.583
[Yennefer] I can make this work.

48:54.041 --> 48:55.916
If you can find a way to trust me.

49:03.416 --> 49:05.791
I need to find Rience to finish him off.

49:08.208 --> 49:09.666
I can't go with you.

49:12.500 --> 49:14.166
And we can't go with you.

49:16.833 --> 49:18.583
Then we have to split up.

49:25.083 --> 49:30.291

She has lost her brother.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.041
And I have lost a dozen more.

49:59.708 --> 50:02.375
We were supposed to attack
the caravan together.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.958
-She lied to us.
-[scoffs]

50:06.333 --> 50:07.625
All this loss

50:08.333 --> 50:09.833
because of one girl.

50:20.666 --> 50:22.666
[Dara breathing heavily]

50:25.916 --> 50:27.250
You knew that girl.

-[winces]
-[grunts]

50:29.041 --> 50:31.666
Princess Cirilla… of Cintra.

50:32.958 --> 50:34.250
[sighs] I warned them.

50:34.750 --> 50:36.250
She brings nothing but death.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.875
The problem isn't her.

50:39.333 --> 50:40.666
It's that one.

50:41.291 --> 50:43.666
I've had enough. Lost enough.

50:43.750 --> 50:44.958
[winces]

50:47.625 --> 50:48.875
Where are you going?

50:49.833 --> 50:52.041
To get help from an old friend.

50:53.708 --> 50:55.375
-[horse neighs]
-[Gallatin] Yah!

51:11.875 --> 51:12.708
Geralt.

51:17.333 --> 51:20.000
Wherever you're going, please come back.

51:22.333 --> 51:23.583
As soon as you can.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.875
Jaskier's waiting for me in Ban Gleán.

51:29.166 --> 51:30.541
But we'll meet again soon.

51:50.791 --> 51:51.791
I've got her.

51:52.750 --> 51:54.250
Whatever you think of me,

51:55.000 --> 51:56.666
that's my promise to you.

51:58.791 --> 52:00.000
I know you do.

52:04.500 --> 52:07.208
-Yen, I--
-Just say this isn't goodbye for good.

52:11.833 --> 52:13.833
That there are more good nights to come.

52:17.291 --> 52:18.458
That you will…

52:20.541 --> 52:21.791
in whatever form…

52:23.458 --> 52:24.791
think of me.

52:32.333 --> 52:34.125
That's my promise to you.

52:35.958 --> 52:37.750
[poignant music]

52:53.375 --> 52:57.416
[Jaskier] It has been…
an eventful few days, and…

52:58.375 --> 53:01.500
I've been thinking about
your… generous offer.

53:01.583 --> 53:03.875
-And your excuse this time is?
-I'll do it.

53:05.083 --> 53:07.291
Ciri's in danger. Uh…

53:07.375 --> 53:09.333
And so are the people around her.

53:10.250 --> 53:11.333
People I love.

53:12.416 --> 53:15.750
It would be best
if she landed somewhere… safe.

53:15.833 --> 53:18.458
And you make quite the case for Redania.

53:18.958 --> 53:23.000
For… eurgh, "settling down".

53:23.083 --> 53:24.375
Wonderful.

53:25.041 --> 53:27.375
-We can escort her back tonight.
-[Jaskier] No.

53:30.041 --> 53:31.125
Not yet.

53:33.083 --> 53:36.791
There's a… mage with a fondness for fire.

53:38.500 --> 53:39.416
Rience.

53:40.291 --> 53:41.666
I'm familiar with his work.

53:41.750 --> 53:42.916
Get rid of him.

53:45.625 --> 53:47.333
Get rid of him, and…

53:49.125 --> 53:51.458
you will have earned Ciri's trust.

53:52.250 --> 53:53.333
And Geralt's.

53:55.791 --> 53:56.916
And mine.

[Yennefer] Dear friend…

54:44.666 --> 54:46.250
I miss you already.

54:47.250 --> 54:49.250
Or should I say, we miss you?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.500
Your friend, Yennefer.

54:56.250 --> 54:59.375
P.S., if Ciri decides
Aretuza is not to her liking,

I have my eyes on our next home.

[thunder rumbles]

55:21.791 --> 55:23.375
…you asked at Belleteyn if…

55:24.708 --> 55:28.458
I left after all those good nights
because I was scared.

55:30.625 --> 55:32.041
Perhaps I was.

55:34.666 --> 55:38.125
Perhaps that is what led me
to this very moment.

[thunder crashing]

55:40.583 --> 55:43.375
Now, for the first time,

I understand real fear.

[dramatic music]

55:50.416 --> 55:52.458
Never seeing you and Ciri again.

56:23.625 --> 56:25.625
I will learn to trust you again.

You, Ciri, and I, we belong together.
