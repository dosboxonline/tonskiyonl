WEBVTT

07:00.586 --> 07:01.587
Come on.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.801
-Come on, boy! (WHISTLES)
-(DOG BARKS)

11:03.704 --> 11:04.997
HERSHEL: Mom! Mom!

11:07.667 --> 11:09.126
Cole has a surprise!

11:10.795 --> 11:12.630
COLE: Guess who this cat dragged in.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.343
Agatha! (CHUCKLES)

11:18.052 --> 11:19.845
Oh!

11:20.596 --> 11:22.515
Can't get rid of us that easy, kid.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.475
Shoulders.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.939
(LAUGHS) I missed you, too, man.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.567
It's good to see you, Mags.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.528
Good to see you, too, Duncan.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.698
I thought you guys were dead.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.451
FROST: We thought the same about you.
When we got to Meridian, we, uh...

11:42.535 --> 11:45.329
well, we figured if you were still alive,
you'd be here.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.709
That him?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.836
-MAN 1: For my family, man!
-MAN 2: Hey!

11:51.919 --> 11:53.212
GABRIEL: Hey, break it up.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.631
-Come on. That's mine, all right?
-I said break it up.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.467
-Come on.
-Everyone calm down.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.720
There's enough food for everyone.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.179
One week.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.515
That's it? In that last run, just a week?

12:04.598 --> 12:06.350
We can make it work.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.435
CAROL: How?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.478
We just took in two new communities.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.355
We have no crops, no back stock.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.440
We can get there.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.693
Got people out there right now,
scavenging houses for materials.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.611
GABRIEL: And they're slowing down.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.615
It's a little hard to put up a wall
with broken tools and an empty stomach.

12:21.699 --> 12:25.911
Our people are good hunters.
Frost and I could take a group out.

12:25.995 --> 12:30.624
Ground's all spent. The last big horde
scared all the animals away.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.711
We can find new territory.

12:33.794 --> 12:37.131
We don't have time. We need food.
Lots of it. Now.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.057
I know one more place.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.728
The place I lived before this.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.104
Where we lived.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.150
Meridian.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.529
It's got plenty of food,
water, crops, and animals.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.824
Yeah, and now it's gone.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.371
So, what happened out there?

13:17.338 --> 13:18.631
We were on a mission.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.300
Leading walkers away.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.553
Duncan, Agatha, and Frost

13:24.637 --> 13:27.807
took the last shift at the front
of the herd. Going miles out.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.934
I circled back with Elijah and Cole.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.105
On the way back home,
things kept going sideways

13:35.189 --> 13:37.149
and we got stuck out on the road.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.944
Looking back now,
I don't think that was an accident.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.741
All of a sudden,
we heard these screams in the distance.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.953
We raced back home.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.164
But it was too late.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.919
Most of our people had been slaughtered.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.425
And the rest of us
barely got away with our lives.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.517
The people that attacked us...

14:11.600 --> 14:13.519
we only knew two things about them.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.064
They come at night,

14:17.147 --> 14:19.608
and by the time you see them,
you're already dead.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.446
That was before we caught one.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.073
Daryl was with me.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.368
He came after us alone.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.288
Why?

14:33.038 --> 14:37.376
Because there aren't that many of them.
They're at Meridian now.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.587
There's plenty of food to feed Alexandria

14:39.670 --> 14:42.172
'til we get this place
back up and running again.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.674
That's why they took it.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.135
We just need to take it back.

14:49.346 --> 14:53.934
So... you're leaving to fight ghosts.
That's the plan?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.936
You have a better one?

14:56.020 --> 14:57.980
Shore up Alexandria, for starters.

14:58.814 --> 15:02.443
The walls are not stable.
Walkers will get inside.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.653
That's not if, it's when.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.196
Alexandria needs us.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.699
This is for Alexandria.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.953
My son is here.
I have skin in the game, too.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.372
ROSITA: Yeah, but if
they slaughtered everyone once,

15:15.456 --> 15:17.291
what the hell makes
this situation any different?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.376
Duncan, Agatha, and Frost
are Meridian's best fighters,

15:19.460 --> 15:22.087
and now I have them.
And hopefully, some of you, too.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.340
Maggie, this sounds like
a suicide mission.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.473
Well, if we don't have food,
it's not gonna matter, anyway.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.600
I'll go.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.518
Anybody else?

15:50.991 --> 15:52.076
All right.

16:17.267 --> 16:21.397
Negan, how much longer
'til we're through the city?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.940
Well, we got about six hours!

16:23.023 --> 16:25.442
We should hunker down,
wait for this to pass!

16:25.526 --> 16:27.569
You don't get a vote, asshole!

16:28.404 --> 16:30.447
DARYL: Ah, he's right.
We need to find some shelter.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.408
No! We don't have time!

16:32.491 --> 16:33.826
We can't stay out in this.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.541
Yeah. Let's go.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.452
All right. Which way?

17:16.535 --> 17:19.788
Not to sound like a broken record,
but I think we ought to take a breath,

17:19.872 --> 17:21.832
hunker down,
and wait for this storm to pass.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.293
You don't wanna go in there?

17:25.919 --> 17:27.296
No, I don't.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.256
I don't give a shit.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.632
Which way?

17:34.303 --> 17:36.263
Yellow line north.

17:36.346 --> 17:40.100
Switch to blue at Reagan National,
then hop the red toward Bethesda.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.353
DARYL: Come on. Let's go.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.897
Hey, can I talk to you?

17:45.856 --> 17:46.899
Why's that?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.443
You think we're buddies or something?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.195
Come on.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.571
Come on, boy.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.707
-ALDEN: What the hell was that?
-(DOG BARKS)

18:49.419 --> 18:52.548
The storm's pushing air through the pipes,
making them groan.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.675
It's nothing serious. We're good.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.730
Know what that noise actually is?

19:08.814 --> 19:11.066
That is God, telling us to turn around.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.820
I'm pretty sure He would have
ran that by me first.

19:14.903 --> 19:18.615
Yeah? The Good Lord direct
your one eyeball to this?

19:19.449 --> 19:20.909
Water-line mark.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.830
That means this tunnel floods
on a regular basis,

19:24.913 --> 19:25.914
like when it rains.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.504
It's bad down here. It's worse up there.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.965
Look, man, all I am saying--

19:35.048 --> 19:36.425
And it ain't working.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.052
You trying to run shit.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.262
Keep moving.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.056
Come on. (WHISTLES)

19:43.140 --> 19:44.683
-Dog!
-(DOG BARKS)

19:45.976 --> 19:47.477
You're in on it.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.244
Eugene Porter?

20:46.578 --> 20:47.996
Yes.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.957
That is my given moniker, yes.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.084
There's no need to be nervous, Mr. Porter.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.920
Not if you're honest with us.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.215
Those who know me,
know me to be an honorable gent.

20:59.174 --> 21:02.803
If you're inferring something
from my manner of speaking, well...

21:02.886 --> 21:04.388
that's just how I roll.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.307
Verbally, that is.

21:07.391 --> 21:11.979
We are Auditors for the Commonwealth,
and you are under Level One Assessment.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.190
If you pass inspection,
you'll move to Level Two.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.025
What if we don't pass inspection?

21:18.193 --> 21:19.987
You will go through re-processing.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.323
What's re-processing?

21:23.407 --> 21:24.992
We should start the assessment.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.622
What did your parents do for a living?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.041
My father was
a mechanical engineer, and...

21:33.125 --> 21:34.876
My mother taught Sunday school.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.338
You mean deadbeat loser number one
or raging prick number two?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.756
What did you do for a living?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.300
I was a zookeeper.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.884
I worked at a music store.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.470
-Lawyer.
-What is your alma mater?

21:45.554 --> 21:47.848
-What's the relevance?
-It's just procedure, ma'am.

21:47.931 --> 21:50.559
I attended Oxford for my bachelor's,
Harvard for Law.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.477
Highest level of schooling?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.855
Three years at
the University of North Carolina.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.273
You didn't graduate?

21:56.356 --> 21:58.525
-I had to leave due to a--
-So, no?

22:01.528 --> 22:02.988
What was your zip code?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.240
How can anyone possibly
be expected to remember that?

22:05.324 --> 22:09.161
From 1978 to 1984, it was 75001.

22:09.870 --> 22:15.208
From 1984 to 1996, it was 76244-0361.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.627
From latter half of 1996 through--

22:17.711 --> 22:20.213
What were the results
of your last routine physical?

22:20.297 --> 22:22.632
Uh... I-I don't think I've had one.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.843
Have you ever been vaccinated for measles?

22:24.926 --> 22:26.178
Would you like the dates?

22:26.261 --> 22:27.929
Any history of cancer?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.181
None.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.351
Tell me about the goiter.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.603
It's a benign growth.
I've had it since childhood.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.688
Where did you get the cash
we found on you?

22:36.772 --> 22:38.190
(SCOFFS) The $2 bill?

22:38.273 --> 22:40.692
Tell us exactly where you got it.

22:40.776 --> 22:44.029
Uh, so, when I was 15, my first job
was at Missy Moose's Pizzeria.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.031
-You know, the--
-You can skip to the end.

22:47.199 --> 22:51.536
When I cashed my paycheck at the bank,
I asked for a $2 bill so I could keep it,

22:51.620 --> 22:53.997
because it was the first money
I'd ever earned.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.711
When we're done with these questions,
can I get my $2 back?

23:00.796 --> 23:02.214
Have you ever been arrested?

23:02.297 --> 23:03.298
No. No.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.176
-Yeah, but it wasn't me. Wasn't me.
-Yes, during a student protest.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.345
-History of drug use?
-Define "drug."

23:08.428 --> 23:10.138
I was a proud founding member

23:10.222 --> 23:12.891
of the anti-drug and alcohol
coalition at my high school.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.143
How many bowel movements
do you have a day?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.436
Excuse me?

23:16.520 --> 23:18.897
-What do you use to wipe?
-Pass.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.732
Why were you at the train station?

23:20.816 --> 23:23.276
I was on the road
with my traveling companions,

23:23.360 --> 23:24.403
Ezekiel and Yumiko--

23:24.486 --> 23:26.905
...for years,
wandering from place to place.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.031
We ran into Princess--

23:28.115 --> 23:31.076
...I helped them out. They loved me.
I decided to stick with 'em.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.495
We were holed up at a place
that had a working radio.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.705
Stephanie and I made a connection.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.083
We wanted to meet,
but my friends were worried, so I--

23:38.166 --> 23:40.085
...pretended like there were more of us
than there really are.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.294
And that's how we wound up
at the rail yard.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.379
So we wound up at the rail yard.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.631
I would really like
to speak with Stephanie.

23:44.714 --> 23:47.426
Do you consider yourself
a fundamentally honest person?

23:47.509 --> 23:48.635
-Yes.
-Of course.

23:48.718 --> 23:49.970
-Yes.
-Hell yeah.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.680
CLARK: Did your mother
work outside the home?

23:51.763 --> 23:55.016
I told you. Grace Baptist Church.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.060
What's the location of your settlement?

23:57.144 --> 23:58.728
You already asked that one.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.606
What was your highest level
of educational attainment?

24:01.690 --> 24:04.693
-CLARK: Location of your settlement?
-What settlement?

24:04.776 --> 24:06.570
Have you run into any groups out there?

24:06.653 --> 24:08.947
We've had some negative encounters.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.242
-How lucky are you and why?
-What?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.369
Location of your settlement.

24:17.581 --> 24:18.915
Do you think this is funny?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.250
Yeah.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.378
Yeah, I do.

24:26.506 --> 24:27.757
Are you in charge?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.557
You've been standing there,

24:35.640 --> 24:38.101
not saying a damn word
like you're the man in charge.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.938
Yeah.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.316
I'm in charge.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.986
Do you think that I fear you?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.948
You look scared to me.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.454
What did you do before the fall?

24:57.537 --> 25:00.373
Let me guess. Asshole beat cop.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.211
That's why this fascist crap
comes so easy to you.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.462
Look at you.

25:05.545 --> 25:08.924
All they had to do was give you
a pumpkin-colored space suit

25:09.007 --> 25:10.383
and you're back to power tripping

25:10.467 --> 25:12.719
with your head up your own ass,
just like before.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.472
You think I was some "power tripping cop"?

25:15.555 --> 25:18.600
The shoe fits. But honestly, I don't care.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.477
You've been asking us
the same damn questions

25:20.560 --> 25:22.854
over and over for seven hours straight.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.231
(PENCIL SCRATCHING)
I've been cooperative.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.024
My people have been cooperati--

25:39.871 --> 25:41.164
Thirsty?

25:41.248 --> 25:42.541
I'm fine.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.240
You told off their leader?

26:19.327 --> 26:20.912
I was asserting myself.

26:22.622 --> 26:25.292
Perhaps I could've
handled it better, but...

26:25.375 --> 26:27.419
I didn't like the way they talked to me.

26:31.756 --> 26:32.841
Ezekiel, do they know--

26:32.924 --> 26:34.634
No. They don't know.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.760
Gonna be fine.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.597
They seem obsessed
with our medical histories.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.764
They might not let you--

26:39.848 --> 26:41.600
I said don't worry about it.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.540
We gotta pull the rip cord on this.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.251
YUMIKO: Yes. Yes. Thank you.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.919
This place is...

27:10.003 --> 27:11.588
I don't even know what this place is.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.798
And does anyone else think
the Commonwealth might not be real?

27:13.882 --> 27:15.342
Yes, Yumiko. Thank you.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.177
I assumed you would think otherwise, but--

27:17.260 --> 27:19.763
It doesn't matter. Never mind.
Time to get out. We gotta--

27:19.846 --> 27:21.139
No, no, no, no.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.600
Please, hold--
hold onto your horses.

27:23.683 --> 27:26.853
Look, they're asking admittedly
strange and intrusive questions,

27:26.936 --> 27:28.063
but in a polite manner,

27:28.146 --> 27:30.190
and this gruel is not
the worst thing I've ever eaten.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.027
Stephanie warned me up front
that her people were uber-cautious.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.572
Michonne, our Michonne

27:37.656 --> 27:39.240
shut people out from Alexandria
for years.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.117
This is a test.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.536
We have to hunker down and level up.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.705
Maybe we should just get honest
with the "heat".

27:45.789 --> 27:47.290
-No. No.
-PRINCESS: Oh, you mean the solider-cops?

27:47.374 --> 27:48.541
Yeah, that's funny. No.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.210
You really want these guys
rolling up to Hilltop

27:50.293 --> 27:52.545
or Alexandria
with their machine-gun swords?

27:53.463 --> 27:54.714
Apologies.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.302
Our people need help,
and I-I think these people can give it.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.221
Excuse me?

28:01.304 --> 28:02.681
Uh, sorry to bother,

28:02.764 --> 28:05.517
but you mind me asking
how long you've been here?

28:06.476 --> 28:07.852
-Four-- Four months.
-Nine.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.563
It's been nine, remember?

28:10.647 --> 28:12.607
Right. Yeah. The-- The re-processing...

28:12.691 --> 28:14.192
But-- But it feels like
things are finally--

28:14.275 --> 28:15.485
I'm sorry. What do you mean?

28:19.489 --> 28:20.657
Wait. Wait!

28:20.740 --> 28:22.367
Wait, no! No!

28:22.450 --> 28:23.618
No!

28:24.202 --> 28:25.412
Stop! Stop!

28:25.495 --> 28:27.205
Wait! Wait!

28:27.288 --> 28:28.373
What did I do?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.126
Where are you taking me?

28:31.209 --> 28:32.502
Re-processing.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.849
Okay, we gotta go.

29:07.787 --> 29:08.788
Oh.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.376
Why didn't it make any noise?

30:05.094 --> 30:07.388
Throat's slashed so deep
it almost severed his head.

30:11.768 --> 30:14.020
The guys we're going after do this?

30:14.103 --> 30:15.146
MAGGIE: No.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.940
These people were killed during the fall.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.242
All of 'em?

30:30.411 --> 30:31.955
What?

30:32.038 --> 30:35.041
We're walking through a mass grave
that could still be in use.

30:35.708 --> 30:38.127
So, I am asking you,

30:38.211 --> 30:41.214
are you sure all of them
were killed during the fall?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.098
Take each one out.

30:51.558 --> 30:52.559
Clear the path.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.938
-Maggie, hold up--
-We're not stopping.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.563
Kid!

32:08.259 --> 32:10.303
Pay attention so we don't miss any more.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.348
Pay attention?

32:14.390 --> 32:15.391
That's it?

32:15.475 --> 32:18.102
That's-- That's your new big plan?

32:19.729 --> 32:23.858
Tell me, Maggie, anything in particular
we should be paying attention to?

32:25.902 --> 32:28.279
I'm real close to shoving
a gag in your mouth.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.825
Well, why don't you get up
on your little tippy toes and try?

32:32.909 --> 32:34.869
DARYL: Cut it out. Both of you.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.789
This kid almost died.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.042
You don't give a shit about that kid.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.044
No, she doesn't give a shit.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.965
She has been playing dictator
since we left,

32:47.048 --> 32:49.842
not listening to me, not listening to him.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.302
Hell, not even listening to you.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.639
We don't know if this tunnel
even has a way out.

32:56.599 --> 33:01.145
Whoever or whatever killed these rot bags
could still be down here.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.940
Has that thought crossed anyone's mind?

33:06.484 --> 33:08.319
Exactly. It has.

33:08.403 --> 33:14.158
So, then this is a death march,
and you are the goddamn pied piper.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.912
Now, y'all wanna roll with
that shit, that's fine.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.163
Knock yourselves out.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.748
But not me. Not today.

33:21.457 --> 33:22.458
I am out.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.380
Me, too.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.840
What?

33:28.923 --> 33:31.134
He-- He's a dick, but he makes sense.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.593
Yeah, we shouldn't have come down here.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.387
We're not splitting up.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.597
It ain't up to you. "Buddy".

33:36.681 --> 33:38.516
AGATHA: Just let him go.

33:38.599 --> 33:41.644
He's supposed to be helping us,
but all he's doing is slowing us down.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.062
-We can't.
-DUNCAN: Why not?

33:43.146 --> 33:44.856
We need him. He knows the city.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.524
NEGAN: Oh, is that why I'm here?

33:46.607 --> 33:49.736
I-I'm your DC tour guide?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.865
What, nobody here know
how to read a goddamn map?

33:55.658 --> 33:59.412
I'll tell you why I'm here, man-tits.
She brought me here to die.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.335
If we get through this,
I'm not coming back.

34:08.004 --> 34:11.257
She'll find a way, she'll find a reason,
she'll do it herself.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.760
Away from the prying eyes of Alexandria.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.804
Here in the jungle.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.518
Man, I really thought you were in on it.

34:22.602 --> 34:23.770
I did.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.607
But see, I can tell from
that glazed look in your eyes,

34:27.690 --> 34:28.941
you didn't have a clue.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.404
None of you did.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.281
You're paranoid.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.574
But I'm right.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.621
Look, you all want to put
your lives in her hands?

34:42.705 --> 34:44.248
Her head isn't even in the game

34:44.332 --> 34:47.043
because I'm in her head, living rent-free.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.172
So, Maggie, me dying on your terms,

34:52.381 --> 34:53.549
it ain't happening.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.511
So, what do you say?

34:57.386 --> 34:58.596
Let's just get her done.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.724
Right here and right now.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.393
Because I am not gonna let you
drag me through the mud,

35:04.477 --> 35:07.688
filth, and slime
to put me down like a dog.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.316
Like Glenn was.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.453
We're down here because up top is death.

35:23.496 --> 35:26.207
We're moving fast
because our kids are starving.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.086
And I'm calling the shots
because that's how everyone voted.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.381
As for me killing you...

35:36.676 --> 35:38.344
It's always on my mind.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.931
I'm not gonna tell you
that you're wrong about me,

35:42.014 --> 35:43.307
because you aren't.

35:44.183 --> 35:49.063
The woman who left six years ago
is not the one standing over you now.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.942
There's a little bit of her left in me,

35:54.277 --> 35:57.321
and that little bit
is the only thing keeping you breathing.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.117
But I don't know
how long that's gonna last.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.788
So keep pushing me, Negan.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.792
Please.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.058
What do you think, Princess?

36:26.767 --> 36:27.768
Princess.

36:28.936 --> 36:30.605
-Princess.
-I'm sorry, what?

36:30.688 --> 36:32.607
Ideas? How to get past the guards.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.150
Oh, yeah. Not yet.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.153
What? What are you looking at?

36:37.236 --> 36:39.405
Livits and Zell are at it again.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.202
What and who-who?
You know, the two

36:44.285 --> 36:46.162
that are always
flirting with each other.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.371
The big guy, Livits.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.789
The skinny one, Zell.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.792
You know their names?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.794
-Yeah.
-You can tell them apart?

36:53.878 --> 36:56.047
-You can't?
-Okay, we're wasting time.

36:56.130 --> 36:59.008
Hold on. Princess,
how can you tell them apart,

36:59.091 --> 37:01.552
and-and why do you believe
that those two are flirting?

37:01.636 --> 37:02.678
Oh, I dunno.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.680
I overheard stuff
when were on the wagon,

37:04.764 --> 37:06.307
and I remember things
about people, you know?

37:06.390 --> 37:07.808
Like, Zell is from Cleveland.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.269
Livits hurt his leg,
so he favors the left one.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.313
Sorsensen smokes.
He doesn't like Garcia.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.940
That's the guy with the bladder problems.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.150
I always used to ask him
if I needed a pee break

37:16.234 --> 37:17.401
when we were driving here.

37:18.194 --> 37:22.657
Oh, and (CHUCKLES) Livits
and Zell are having sex,

37:22.740 --> 37:24.617
but they don't want anyone to know.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.668
They're not
looking at each other.

37:33.751 --> 37:37.797
Yeah, but it's obvious from the way
they're not looking at each other

37:37.880 --> 37:39.423
that they're jonesing for it.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.093
They, uh, change shifts every six hours.

37:42.176 --> 37:45.137
Whenever they're on break,
one of them takes off,

37:45.221 --> 37:47.682
and then three minutes later,
the other one disappears, too.

37:48.849 --> 37:51.018
Gone for about an hour,
<i>mas o menos.</i>

37:52.687 --> 37:55.982
Probably most of the time is spent
taking off their armor.

38:02.780 --> 38:03.948
Oh.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.033
Uh-huh.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.498
CLARK: What was the result
of your last routine physical?

38:15.418 --> 38:18.087
MAN: I don't understand these questions!

38:18.170 --> 38:19.380
What are you talking about?

38:28.681 --> 38:30.349
-(DOOR OPENS)
-WOMAN: Hey!

38:30.433 --> 38:32.268
Where are you taking those two?

38:36.814 --> 38:38.274
Yeah, that's what I'd like to know!

38:38.357 --> 38:39.859
This is bullshit! We have rights!

38:39.942 --> 38:41.444
YUMIKO: Re-processing.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.156
Move along.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.976
EZEKIEL: A wall of the lost.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.994
We have a straight shot
to the back gate, but we gotta go now.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.210
PRINCESS: Yumiko!

39:39.293 --> 39:40.795
-Let's go, let's go!
-No.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.713
<i>Mira.</i>

39:43.923 --> 39:44.965
Isn't that you?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.538
Yumiko!

40:18.833 --> 40:20.042
I...

40:21.669 --> 40:22.962
I have to stay.

40:47.194 --> 40:48.237
Shit.

40:57.329 --> 40:58.456
ALDEN: Need a battery swap.

40:58.539 --> 40:59.540
Gage?

41:02.293 --> 41:04.962
Gage? Roy?

41:05.045 --> 41:06.130
Has anyone seen them?

41:07.423 --> 41:09.216
GABRIEL: They took our supplies.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.303
Ammo clips, rations--

41:12.386 --> 41:14.096
FROST: Oh, great. That's just great.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.974
It's this asshole's fault.
He scared them off.

41:17.057 --> 41:18.100
Shh!

41:19.059 --> 41:20.269
Listen.

41:36.744 --> 41:37.995
All right. Cut them off.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.122
-We'll clear the rest.
-Agatha!

42:05.814 --> 42:07.650
-Blocked.
-ALDEN: Here, too.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.360
Hold this. Let me try.

42:28.587 --> 42:30.297
Fall back! Now!

42:30.965 --> 42:32.424
Go! Go!

42:38.847 --> 42:40.724
-Go!
-MAGGIE: Can we get around it?

42:40.808 --> 42:41.892
It's a choke point.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.561
We don't know
what's on the other side.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.105
Up top.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.439
Go, all the way up.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.905
Go, man. Up top. On top of the platform.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.365
Go. Hurry.

43:03.747 --> 43:04.957
Come on, man, get up.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.917
All the way up to the top. Go!

-Dog! No! Come here! Dog!

43:16.051 --> 43:17.511
Go. Let's go. Let's go.

Meet me at the next platform.
