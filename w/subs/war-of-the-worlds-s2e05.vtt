00:48.240 --> 00:49.240
Him.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.640
(IN ENGLISH) Where have you come from?

00:50.760 --> 00:53.400
I was at the leisure centre at Mile End.
We were attacked.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.120
He was teaching at Tythehurst College
when he wrote the book.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.120
Have you thought about what we're going
to do if we can't find him?

02:27.320 --> 02:28.800
We have to.

she's an alien?

of this biological weapon?

No. It'll take months before it's ready,

05:44.840 --> 05:46.200
Show me.

I really didn't mean to.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.280
Sacha...

Bill wanted to take Emily to a lab
so he could keep experimenting on her.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
I had to stop him.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.440
What is that to do with Ash?

06:22.680 --> 06:25.320
Ash walked in on us. There was a fight.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.280
I didn't mean to kill him.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.080
It was an accident...

What about Bill?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.080
What did you do with his body?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.320
He's alive. He ran away.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.000
What do you think the others will do
when they find out you killed Ash?

06:43.120 --> 06:44.280
They think the aliens killed him.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.440
And if he comes back
and tells them it was you?

06:47.520 --> 06:49.400
I was doing it for Emily.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.040
I love her.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.600
You barely know her.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.880
This is crazy.

06:55.960 --> 06:59.320
You kill someone
because you like some girl you just met?

I don't expect you to understand.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.720
Oh yeah?

07:05.360 --> 07:07.120
So make me understand.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.840
We have to go.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.880
We have to leave before the others
realise what you did.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.520
I'm not going anywhere without Emily.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.440
They will kill you, Sacha.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.960

I won't let you become like him,
like your father.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.520
I won't let that happen...

between you and Emily?

trying to kill Bill?

Yes.

Why did you do it?

08:29.240 --> 08:30.680
They got inside my head.

They made me feel like
I was one of them.

it's just us that can sense them?

08:43.520 --> 08:44.600
I don't know.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.640
Maybe what we have is special.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.960
It doesn't feel very special.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.120
It does to me.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.240
I wouldn't change it.

because you're so screwed up

22:03.000 --> 22:05.760
you can't even cry when
the man you love dies.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.320
You promised her that you'd make
a better future for our baby.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.240
I tried.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.080
Was it really about our baby...

22:19.960 --> 22:22.560
or was it a mathematical problem...

22:24.160 --> 22:25.960
something you wanted to solve?

22:27.200 --> 22:28.560
Don't worry.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.960
It's not the first time
you've let her down.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.200
You've never been there for her...

22:40.920 --> 22:42.520
I'll wake you in two hours.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.680
(IN ENGLISH) I was looking for you.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.720
Sacha.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.600
What is it?

23:22.560 --> 23:24.280
We're meant to be together.
We've seen it.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.880
How have we seen it?

23:30.760 --> 23:31.760
I don't know.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.680
I think it's bigger than us.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.400
We have to trust our feelings.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.800
I know you feel it too.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.880
Everything is gonna be all right
if we're together.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.840
I promise.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.320
Maybe this was always going to happen.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.400
We should be together.

25:24.960 --> 25:25.960
(IN FRENCH)

25:26.040 --> 25:27.400
I saw a light.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.200
It might be our professor.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.840
There were people living here.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.120
Catherine?

28:53.440 --> 28:54.480
You think he killed himself?

28:55.600 --> 28:56.920
Looks that way.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.400
He bandaged his wrist?

29:04.040 --> 29:05.800
Maybe he changed his mind.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.240
Don't shoot it! Don't shoot it!

29:45.520 --> 29:46.880
What is that?

29:48.920 --> 29:50.280
I don't know.

30:50.800 --> 30:51.800
(IN ENGLISH) We have to go.

31:15.560 --> 31:16.560
(IN FRENCH)

31:16.640 --> 31:17.640
Wait.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.240
Should you be doing this?
What about the baby?

31:20.320 --> 31:24.040
Don't worry. It's okay to carry
dead bodies in your first trimester.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.360
You think he'd just had enough?

31:30.920 --> 31:32.000
I guess so...

31:33.120 --> 31:34.800
I'll check the rest of the building.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.880
This data is full of the same constants
that appear in the notebook.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.520
You planning on getting any sleep?

34:27.360 --> 34:28.440
You're awake.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.520
Can you find your own people?

34:35.680 --> 34:36.800
You're letting me go?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.880
Well, it's either that or I shoot you.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.440
And that would be

34:43.440 --> 34:45.000
a strange thing to do.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.960
Why did you help me?

34:49.800 --> 34:51.280
What he did to you in there,

34:53.320 --> 34:54.640
nobody deserves that.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.200
When I was sleeping,

35:03.840 --> 35:05.400
were you gonna take the gun
and shoot me?

35:08.240 --> 35:09.240
Yes.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.800
(SCOFFS)

35:10.880 --> 35:12.280
I save your life

35:13.800 --> 35:15.040
and you try to kill me?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.120
Why do you hate us?

35:21.600 --> 35:24.320
-It won't make sense to you.
-No, no, no. Try me.

35:24.840 --> 35:25.920
What do you want?

35:27.240 --> 35:29.560
Why did you come here?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.920
I won't betray my people.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.640
(SIGHS) You can go.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.000
I'm not gonna stop you.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.040
(GROANS)

36:04.440 --> 36:05.520
My stomach.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.560
(CONTINUES GROANING)

36:12.440 --> 36:14.680
Do you mind if I examine you?

36:27.200 --> 36:28.280
Jesus.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.960
He was kicking me.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.160
He wouldn't stop.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.080
I think you have a haematoma.

36:48.280 --> 36:51.040
I'll go and see if
I can find some painkillers.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.640
Here.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.880
I've got to go somewhere.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.200
Zoe?

39:30.120 --> 39:31.320
Zoe, are you out there?

39:33.360 --> 39:34.480
Zoe, it's Bill.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.440
Zoe.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
(DOOR CLOSES)

40:02.360 --> 40:03.360
Hungry?

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
SOPHIA: Catherine?

40:55.720 --> 40:56.880
(IN FRENCH)

40:56.960 --> 40:58.200
Hey.

40:59.800 --> 41:00.960
Hey.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
What time is it?

41:06.400 --> 41:07.840
Just after nine.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.160
How's your new pet?

41:16.280 --> 41:17.680
Did you give it a name?

41:17.760 --> 41:18.800
No.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.640
He looks like a Bob.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.200
Bob is really smart.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.720
All this data.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.040
It took me all night
to figure out what it is.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.120
-What is it?
-Watch.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.600
Wait. You're going
to hit Bob with a hammer?

41:46.680 --> 41:48.240
Look at the screen...

41:55.000 --> 41:56.560
It's analysing my movement.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.440
Not just my actual movement.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.680
It's calculating every possible movement
I could make...

42:01.360 --> 42:02.440
Look.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.160
This.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.840
Or this.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.200
Or this.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.040
It's calculating all the possibilities
in an instant.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.920
And this makes Bob smart?

42:19.040 --> 42:21.840
His sensors work on a quantum level.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.160
I can feed this data into the formulas
in the notebook.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.360
It should help me understand them.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.240
So you and Bob are working together now?

42:31.120 --> 42:32.120
Yes.

42:32.880 --> 42:33.960
He's my assistant.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.560
(IN ENGLISH)

43:30.640 --> 43:32.960
Don't know if anyone's
ever gonna see this, but...

43:33.760 --> 43:35.760
Well, it's two days since the attack.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.160
The Internet's down,

43:37.240 --> 43:39.560
so we don't have any way of finding out
what's going on out there.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.240
We have food, water and power.

43:43.680 --> 43:44.760
So, erm,

43:45.400 --> 43:47.440
I guess we're doing okay.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.560
Lilly, do you wanna say something?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.200
LILY: No. I don't know what to say.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.120
Just say how you're feeling.

44:00.360 --> 44:01.440
I'm scared.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.720
I miss my mum and dad, my friends.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.720
I hate not knowing
what's happened to them.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.920
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

44:15.880 --> 44:16.960
We're safe.

44:28.520 --> 44:29.600
Day three.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.120
We're hanging in there.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.960
Every day, it gets a little bit harder.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.960
I guess this is the last time
I record one of these.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.320
They say your whole life
flashes before you

44:56.880 --> 44:58.040
just before you die.

45:00.040 --> 45:03.440
What if it's just one life?

45:04.720 --> 45:09.880
One life of infinite possible
other lives.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.280
Every time we make a choice,

45:14.880 --> 45:16.400
we start a new path.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.880
What if you also continue

45:21.880 --> 45:22.960
on the other path?

45:24.240 --> 45:26.320
There's a path where I made

45:27.840 --> 45:29.160
different choices.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.560
I'm sorry, Lilly.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.640
I'm so sorry.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.360
I love you.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.160
(GROANS)

45:58.520 --> 45:59.760
Is anyone out there?

46:05.080 --> 46:06.320
BILL OVER RADIO: Zoe, can you hear me?

46:10.320 --> 46:12.680
-Bill, where are you?
-I'm in an apartment.

46:13.720 --> 46:15.920
I went back to the leisure centre
to get a radio.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.200
What happened to you? Ash is dead.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.160
Yeah. Sacha...

46:21.000 --> 46:22.360
He tried to kill me.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.120
He killed Ash.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.640
He stabbed him.

46:25.720 --> 46:26.800
It was Sacha?

46:26.880 --> 46:28.160
He stabbed Ash.

46:28.640 --> 46:30.680
I went back to the cinema.
They were all over it.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.720
I thought they'd got you.

46:34.800 --> 46:35.920
We got out.

46:37.240 --> 46:38.400
What about Tom?

46:38.560 --> 46:39.640
Yeah, he's fine.

46:40.680 --> 46:41.760
And Emily?

46:42.280 --> 46:43.360
Yeah, she's safe.

46:43.480 --> 46:44.560
We're giving her insulin.

46:44.840 --> 46:49.080
Listen, you've got to get her to my
old lab so that I can extract the virus.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.480
They're not gonna let me just take her.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.080
I'll have to get her away
from the others.

46:54.320 --> 46:58.440
Okay. God, it's good to hear your voice.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.680
We should conserve our batteries.

47:01.880 --> 47:03.720
I'll let you know
as soon as I've got Emily.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.280
Okay. Over and out.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.440
Bill, no one really says that.

47:10.960 --> 47:12.360
Okay. Right.
