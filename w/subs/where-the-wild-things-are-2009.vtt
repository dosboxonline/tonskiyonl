01:27.729 --> 01:31.149
Hey, Claire.
Wanna see something great?

01:31.316 --> 01:33.151
Who else was there?

01:33.318 --> 01:34.736
It's an igloo.

01:35.153 --> 01:36.988
- And?
- I made it.

01:37.155 --> 01:38.657
Yeah, my brother.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.242
Hey, Claire.

01:40.408 --> 01:42.953
I can't. We're supposed to
go to my dad's that weekend.

01:43.119 --> 01:46.790
The snowplows left some snow across
the street, and I dug a hole into it.

01:46.957 --> 01:48.750
Max, go and play with your friends.

02:05.517 --> 02:07.102
You, go that way.

02:07.269 --> 02:09.770
You, go that way.

02:09.937 --> 02:12.858
No, don't talk to me like that.
You're just a fence.

02:13.024 --> 02:15.193
You can go play
with your own fence friends.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.486
Now, move out!

02:33.461 --> 02:35.589
So sweet. Yeah.
That's gonna be awesome.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.843
Hey, Claire. What's up? You ready?
Hey, guys.

03:14.044 --> 03:15.712
And close them, okay?

03:20.925 --> 03:22.510
Whoa!

03:22.761 --> 03:24.679
Claire, is that your brother?
Come on!

03:26.097 --> 03:27.432
Oh, yeah.

03:29.017 --> 03:30.352
Get him. You're dead.

03:30.518 --> 03:31.561
Yeah.

03:36.691 --> 03:38.735
He is so dead.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.406
Max, go away.

03:43.948 --> 03:46.576
Got him! Yeah!

03:46.785 --> 03:49.037
Get him. Come on, come on, come on.

04:13.269 --> 04:14.938
You okay?

04:15.105 --> 04:17.982
Come on, guys. Let's go!

06:17.393 --> 06:18.895
Hey, I'm home.

06:22.357 --> 06:23.858
Hey.

06:24.525 --> 06:25.610
What's wrong?

06:32.950 --> 06:36.746
Claire and her stupid friends
smashed my igloo.

06:39.582 --> 06:42.752
She didn't do anything about it.

06:43.795 --> 06:46.047
I'm sorry, honey.

06:49.634 --> 06:52.470
I would have done something about it.

07:04.816 --> 07:07.485
Max, what have you done?

07:09.654 --> 07:11.572
Oh, my god.

07:18.246 --> 07:19.872
No, I don't wanna bother you.
Just...

07:20.039 --> 07:22.166
Just quickly...

07:22.333 --> 07:26.629
Can you tell me exactly what
Mr. Lasseter didn't like about the report?

07:28.506 --> 07:31.300
Well, what am I supposed to do?

07:34.637 --> 07:38.808
No, I'm just tired,
and I've had a rough day here and...

07:39.433 --> 07:44.063
I... I... I cannot afford to lose this.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.695
I know, I know it.

07:50.862 --> 07:55.324
But I better get started because
I'd like to turn it in in the morning.

07:56.534 --> 07:58.035
No, I hear you. I hear you.

07:58.202 --> 08:01.622
And this'll be the last time.
I promise, okay?

08:02.081 --> 08:03.624
Thanks.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.556
Hey.

08:20.057 --> 08:21.642
Hi.

08:21.893 --> 08:24.478
I could use a story.

08:29.734 --> 08:31.068
Sure.

08:35.155 --> 08:36.991
There were some buildings.

08:38.701 --> 08:40.703
There were these really tall buildings...

08:40.912 --> 08:42.246
And they could walk.

08:43.205 --> 08:45.875
Then there were some vampires.

08:46.083 --> 08:49.587
And one of the vampires
bit the tallest building...

08:49.754 --> 08:52.673
And his fangs broke off.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.093
Then all his other teeth fell out.

08:56.260 --> 08:58.971
Then he started crying.

08:59.180 --> 09:03.517
And then all the other vampires...

09:03.684 --> 09:07.396
Said, "why are you crying?

09:07.772 --> 09:10.733
Aren't those just your baby teeth?"

09:10.900 --> 09:12.652
And...

09:13.069 --> 09:17.907
And he said, "no.
Those are my grown-up teeth."

09:18.199 --> 09:24.413
And the vampires knew that
he couldn't be a vampire anymore...

09:24.580 --> 09:26.248
So they left him.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.463
The end.

09:47.895 --> 09:51.607
And the sun is the center
of our solar system.

09:51.774 --> 09:53.651
It's the reason
all the planets are here.

09:53.818 --> 09:57.113
Its warmth gives us sunlight,
makes our planet livable.

09:57.321 --> 09:59.949
Of course the sun won't always
be here to keep us warm.

10:00.116 --> 10:03.661
It, like all things, will die.

10:03.828 --> 10:06.247
And when it does, first it expands...

10:06.414 --> 10:09.208
Enveloping all the surrounding
planets, including earth...

10:09.375 --> 10:11.127
Before consuming them rapidly.

10:11.585 --> 10:15.798
The sun, after all, it's just fuel
burning ferociously.

10:15.965 --> 10:19.593
And when it runs out of fuel,
well, it'll be gone.

10:19.844 --> 10:25.182
And, well, after that, the solar
system will go dark permanently.

10:26.142 --> 10:27.977
I mean, I'm sure by that time...

10:28.144 --> 10:31.021
The human race will have fallen
to any number of calamities:

10:31.188 --> 10:33.274
<i>War, pollution...</i>

10:33.441 --> 10:35.359
<i>Global warming, tsunamis...</i>

10:35.401 --> 10:37.278
<i>Global warming, tsunamis...</i>

10:38.028 --> 10:40.322
<i>Earthquakes, meteors.</i>

10:41.365 --> 10:45.202
<i>But, hey, who knows, right?</i>

11:14.565 --> 11:15.858
Mom!

11:16.025 --> 11:17.693
Mom, come up here.

11:17.902 --> 11:19.570
Max, I'm busy.

11:19.737 --> 11:21.155
I've rebuilt the fort!

11:21.322 --> 11:24.033
You gotta get inside it.
The lava's coming.

11:26.035 --> 11:30.497
Oh, and it's a rocket ship,
and it's gonna take off.

11:30.748 --> 11:33.083
Here's looking at you.

11:34.501 --> 11:36.921
Want me to save you a seat?

11:37.087 --> 11:39.423
Oh, blessed liege.

12:07.284 --> 12:09.244
You're really...

12:09.536 --> 12:10.579
- Nice.
- Cute.

12:12.039 --> 12:13.457
- No, really.
- You're really.

12:24.927 --> 12:26.929
Hi, sweetie.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.931
Claire?

12:29.139 --> 12:34.186
It's almost dinner.
Get your stuff off the table, please.

12:45.906 --> 12:48.325
Hey. Shh.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.457
Mom, what is that?

12:57.167 --> 12:58.836
PÃ¢tÃ©.

13:02.339 --> 13:04.967
Frozen corn.
What's wrong with real corn?

13:05.175 --> 13:06.969
Frozen corn is real, all right?

13:07.177 --> 13:10.889
Get off the chair, please. Tell your
sister to clear her stuff off the table.

13:11.056 --> 13:15.519
Claire, get your stuff
off the dining room table!

13:17.855 --> 13:21.191
Max, don't pull that now.

13:26.864 --> 13:29.700
Max, get off the counter, please.
Get off.

13:29.867 --> 13:31.994
I have a friend here.
You're embarrassing me.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.954
Woman, feed me!

13:35.164 --> 13:37.541
Max, get off the co... get off the counter.

13:38.542 --> 13:42.504
Get off the damn counter, Max.
Now. Now.

13:42.713 --> 13:44.631
- I'll eat you up!
- Get down!

13:45.298 --> 13:47.309
Get off of there.

13:47.509 --> 13:48.510
- Stop!
- Hey.

13:48.719 --> 13:49.845
Get over here.

13:50.304 --> 13:53.515
What is wrong with you?
This is not acceptable behavior.

13:53.724 --> 13:55.350
You're not acceptable!

13:55.517 --> 13:58.687
No dinner for you, Max.
Go to your room.

13:58.854 --> 14:02.900
- Max, you bit me. That hurt!
- Connie, he can't treat you like that.

14:03.066 --> 14:05.569
Max! What is wrong with you?

14:06.111 --> 14:07.779
You're out of control!

14:07.946 --> 14:10.115
It's not my fault!

14:17.581 --> 14:18.874
Max!

14:20.250 --> 14:21.460
Max!

14:25.923 --> 14:27.716
Max!

14:30.385 --> 14:32.012
Max!

14:43.482 --> 14:45.234
Max!

14:55.369 --> 14:57.913
I hate you!

16:40.390 --> 16:42.017
Hello?

20:06.262 --> 20:09.307
That's it. Tear them all down.
Tear them down.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.565
Come on, we got a few more to go
over here.

20:23.947 --> 20:25.448
Is anyone going to help me?

20:27.116 --> 20:29.285
We like them. They're nice.

20:30.161 --> 20:32.914
I mean, this is a problem.
Don't you see this is a problem?

20:33.122 --> 20:35.250
I will...
No, I'll just do it myself.

20:35.416 --> 20:37.293
Help. As usual.

20:37.460 --> 20:39.921
Uh, Carol, could I talk to you
for a second?

20:40.088 --> 20:41.381
No, Douglas, not right now.

20:41.548 --> 20:42.882
- I'm busy. Okay.

20:43.049 --> 20:44.801
Maybe they can't hear me from up here.

20:44.968 --> 20:47.554
And I'm the only one
who cares enough to do this.

20:49.138 --> 20:50.765
Or this.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.351
Carol, is this really necessary?

20:53.518 --> 20:56.729
Ask kw. You ask kw if it's necessary.

20:56.896 --> 20:58.439
She's not here. She left.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.900
Aha. She left. She left.

21:01.067 --> 21:03.403
Exactly. That's why it's necessary.

21:03.570 --> 21:05.113
Um, I will help.

21:05.321 --> 21:08.157
Okay. Okay, good. Come on.
Come on, here you go.

21:11.119 --> 21:12.787
Thank you. Glad to help.

21:12.996 --> 21:14.414
Who else wants to lend a hand?

21:14.580 --> 21:16.457
What do you think, Judith? Should I help?

21:16.624 --> 21:19.502
You shouldn't help him.
I thought it'd make him feel better.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.588
Good idea. Go stand
in this hut here before it gets wrecked.

21:22.755 --> 21:23.965
I know. I know I shouldn't.

21:24.132 --> 21:26.009
Ira, you're not helping. Go in the hut.

21:26.175 --> 21:28.344
- I'll stand right over here.
- No!

21:32.307 --> 21:33.975
This is crazy!

21:34.142 --> 21:35.518
No, no, it was crazy already.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.520
I'm just eliminating the crazy.

21:37.895 --> 21:40.481
I don't think the crazy's
been eliminated.

21:40.648 --> 21:43.359
Isn't anyone gonna
be on my side anymore?

21:44.193 --> 21:45.320
Yeah, well...

21:46.070 --> 21:48.072
I guess not.

21:50.366 --> 21:51.909
Fine.

21:52.869 --> 21:55.413
I'll just be on my own side...

21:56.247 --> 21:58.166
By myself.

22:03.379 --> 22:07.675
Nobody cares. I'm the only one
that cares that we don't stay together.

22:08.384 --> 22:11.512
I'm the only one that cares
about that, so...

22:12.221 --> 22:14.057
See? I care.

22:14.223 --> 22:15.725
Carol.

22:15.892 --> 22:19.729
And you don't care, and you stand there
and whisper to each other about me...

22:19.896 --> 22:22.065
Like you always do.
Yeah, that's true.

22:22.231 --> 22:23.733
But I know what I'm do...

22:30.490 --> 22:32.241
- Ira, what is it?
- I don't know.

23:04.398 --> 23:05.775
Hello.

23:38.432 --> 23:39.934
See?

23:40.101 --> 23:42.228
This guy gets it.

23:43.563 --> 23:44.730
Hey, uh...

23:44.897 --> 23:48.693
Weird little thing. I like the way
you destroy stuff. Good technique.

23:48.859 --> 23:51.153
There's a spark to your work
that can't be taught.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.739
- Thanks.
- All right, you see that one over there?

23:53.906 --> 23:55.575
You get that one, I'll get this one.

23:55.741 --> 23:57.702
- See who can do it faster, okay?
- Okay.

23:58.202 --> 23:59.495
Go!

24:21.892 --> 24:23.227
Hey.

24:23.686 --> 24:25.813
- What are you doing?
- I... I...

24:27.982 --> 24:30.860
- I'm just helping.
- By smashing our houses?

24:31.027 --> 24:32.820
- These are your houses? Yeah.

24:34.196 --> 24:36.321
- What's wrong with them?
- What are your houses like?

24:36.365 --> 24:39.827
- I bet his houses are funny-looking.
- Look, we worked very hard on these.

24:40.036 --> 24:43.289
Then you, sir, showed up
and started helping.

24:43.456 --> 24:44.540
- I'm cold.
- Who are you?

24:44.707 --> 24:46.500
Are you one of kw's new friends?

24:46.709 --> 24:48.669
Oh, are you Bob or Terry?

24:48.878 --> 24:50.671
I don't even know who that is.

24:50.838 --> 24:53.132
- Looks like a Bob.
- Things are getting crazy here.

24:53.299 --> 24:55.301
- This thing's dangerous.
- You're scaring me.

24:55.468 --> 24:57.345
You know what I say.
You got a problem...

24:57.887 --> 24:59.430
Eat it.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.932
It's the only way to solve
these types of issues.

25:02.099 --> 25:03.184
Only way.

25:03.351 --> 25:05.227
He's probably got those little bird bones.

25:05.394 --> 25:06.562
I hate those.

25:06.729 --> 25:08.938
You have those bird bones
that are gonna cut my mouth?

25:09.023 --> 25:11.025
- No, I don't have bird bones.
- You better not.

25:11.233 --> 25:13.903
You better not be difficult to eat.
You even think of that?

25:14.070 --> 25:15.488
God, you're selfish.

25:15.654 --> 25:18.199
I hope you don't taste
as selfish as you look.

25:18.449 --> 25:19.950
- Let's eat it.
- Stop.

25:24.538 --> 25:25.539
- Stop! Look at him.

25:25.748 --> 25:28.250
He's so delectable and so chewable.

25:29.376 --> 25:31.045
Be still!

25:36.092 --> 25:37.134
Why?

25:37.802 --> 25:40.596
Be... because, well... well...

25:42.098 --> 25:43.474
Be... because...

25:44.433 --> 25:47.895
- Why?
- Well, because you can't eat me.

25:49.563 --> 25:52.316
You didn't know that so I forgive you,
but never try again.

25:52.483 --> 25:53.526
Why not?

25:54.235 --> 25:57.279
I... I have powers from another land.

25:57.446 --> 26:00.741
Powers? From ancient times.

26:01.534 --> 26:03.119
Don't make me show you.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.496
I had to show these vikings once.

26:05.663 --> 26:08.833
- Vikings? What's a viking?
- Well...

26:08.999 --> 26:11.961
They wear horned hats,
and they're big.

26:13.045 --> 26:14.463
Bigger than all of you.

26:15.256 --> 26:17.842
One time they attacked me
in my ice fortress.

26:18.008 --> 26:21.720
They tried to cave in the roof,
but I had made it too strong.

26:22.429 --> 26:25.140
I told them to be still, but they didn't.

26:25.307 --> 26:26.600
I conquered them.

26:27.184 --> 26:29.937
- I had to make their heads explode.
- What?

26:30.145 --> 26:33.983
And then they realized that I knew
all the secrets to the world.

26:35.317 --> 26:37.152
And then you know what happened?

26:40.155 --> 26:43.284
- They made me their king.
- Whoa.

26:43.492 --> 26:45.661
- King?
- You were a king?

26:45.828 --> 26:48.998
I knew there was something special
about him. I told you guys.

26:49.164 --> 26:51.584
So, wait, you exploded their heads?

26:51.750 --> 26:55.504
Oh, come on. Our heads are bigger.
You can't explode big heads.

26:55.671 --> 26:58.257
No, their heads were bigger
than yours, believe me.

26:58.424 --> 27:00.342
But you're so small.

27:00.509 --> 27:04.513
Small is good. My powers are able to
slip right through the cracks.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.099
But what if the cracks are closed up?

27:07.266 --> 27:09.310
I have a re-cracker,
which goes through that.

27:09.518 --> 27:12.396
What if they have some material
re-crackers can't get through?

27:12.563 --> 27:16.317
Then I have a double re-cracker, which can
get through anything in this universe.

27:16.483 --> 27:20.529
And that's the end, and there's nothing
more powerful after that, ever. Period.

27:20.696 --> 27:23.198
He has a double re-cracker.
He does sound powerful.

27:23.365 --> 27:25.743
Yeah, but there has to be
some material somewhere...

27:25.909 --> 27:27.369
- Maybe deep underground.
- Shh!

27:27.536 --> 27:30.831
- If we combined it with something...
- Quiet. Be quiet.

27:31.832 --> 27:33.792
I'm sorry. So...

27:33.959 --> 27:37.713
You were their king,
and you made everything right?

27:39.173 --> 27:40.674
Yeah.

27:40.883 --> 27:44.720
Well, you know, what about loneliness?

27:44.887 --> 27:49.141
What he's saying is,
will you keep out all the sadness?

27:59.193 --> 28:02.446
I have a sadness shield
that keeps out all the sadness.

28:02.613 --> 28:04.365
And it's big enough for all of us.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.367
Wow.

28:06.575 --> 28:09.036
And I do this to loneliness.

28:11.372 --> 28:15.084
I knew it, I knew it.
When he showed up, I saw it.

28:15.334 --> 28:17.044
Why don't you guys ever listen to me?

28:17.252 --> 28:20.381
You're right, Carol. I didn't see it.

28:20.547 --> 28:23.425
I don't understand.
He doesn't look like a king.

28:23.592 --> 28:25.928
If he could be king, I could be king.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.138
Were you the king where you came from?

28:28.305 --> 28:30.432
Yeah. Yeah, for 20 years.

28:31.934 --> 28:33.894
- That's impressive.
- That's incredible, right?

28:34.061 --> 28:37.731
Wow. Looks like we found our king.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.817
You are our king, right?

28:39.983 --> 28:41.527
Yeah.

28:42.736 --> 28:44.822
Yeah, I am.

28:45.114 --> 28:47.241
- I'm so relieved.
- Sorry we were gonna eat you.

28:47.407 --> 28:49.243
- We didn't know you were king.
- Insane.

28:49.535 --> 28:51.203
- Yeah, I mean...
- Oh, my god, it's kw.

28:51.370 --> 28:52.412
- What?
- What?

28:52.579 --> 28:55.624
- Oh, hi, kw.
- Kw, good to see you.

28:55.791 --> 28:58.585
I thought you were with
your new best friends, Bob and Terry.

28:58.794 --> 29:00.420
What are you guys doing?

29:01.171 --> 29:02.631
- Who is that? Kw, get in here.

29:02.798 --> 29:04.758
You gotta hear this. We finally got a king.

29:04.967 --> 29:06.635
- That's true.
- A very impressive one.

29:06.802 --> 29:08.137
Yeah, kw, we got a king.

29:08.303 --> 29:11.557
You and me could go for a walk,
and I'll tell you about it. Anytime.

29:11.765 --> 29:14.643
You could carry me like a little baby.

29:14.810 --> 29:16.019
Um...

29:16.186 --> 29:18.564
Yeah, anyway,
I don't know if I'm sticking around.

29:18.730 --> 29:20.732
I just came back...

29:22.484 --> 29:25.154
To get that one stick that I left here.
Did anyone see it?

29:25.320 --> 29:27.990
I'll help find it, kw.
I'm good at finding sticks.

29:28.824 --> 29:30.576
Kw, he's very powerful.

29:30.742 --> 29:33.579
Stop, stop. Don't push her.
She'll figure it out for herself.

29:33.745 --> 29:35.539
Just leave her be, okay?

29:35.706 --> 29:39.793
King. King, this way.
Your majesty, please.

29:44.006 --> 29:47.467
Oh, look. He's gonna
make us happy, Judy.

29:47.676 --> 29:48.802
Yeah.

29:49.344 --> 29:51.763
But happiness isn't always
the best way to be happy.

29:51.930 --> 29:53.682
Judith, stop.

29:53.849 --> 29:55.017
He's small for a king.

29:55.183 --> 29:57.311
- Am I nuts? He's small.
- That's what I said.

29:57.477 --> 29:59.438
Alexander. Shh. Sorry.

30:09.489 --> 30:11.533
I like it better when we have a king.

30:14.036 --> 30:15.954
I like Carol better
when we have a king.

30:16.955 --> 30:18.749
Hey, what happened to our houses?

30:20.459 --> 30:22.336
They fell down.

30:33.180 --> 30:35.474
Are those other kings?

30:37.351 --> 30:39.019
They were there before we got here.

30:39.186 --> 30:42.356
I never saw them.
I never even noticed them.

30:49.446 --> 30:51.073
You okay?

30:52.240 --> 30:53.867
Yeah.

30:59.581 --> 31:01.958
You are now the king.

31:02.668 --> 31:05.170
And you will be a truly great king.

31:06.129 --> 31:07.923
Look at it.
It looks good on him, look.

31:08.256 --> 31:09.424
He looks great. Our king!

31:09.591 --> 31:11.301
- You look perfect.
- It looks perfect.

31:11.468 --> 31:13.679
We have a king. Fresh king.

31:13.845 --> 31:15.555
Finally. A king!

31:15.806 --> 31:16.890
I know this part.

31:17.265 --> 31:18.266
<i>King, king, king...</i>

31:18.433 --> 31:21.770
Hey, king, what's
your first order of business?

31:24.189 --> 31:26.733
Let the wild rumpus start!

31:28.276 --> 31:30.278
Perfect answer!

31:30.862 --> 31:32.781
You hear that?

31:33.115 --> 31:34.908
Rumpus!

31:35.117 --> 31:38.286
Come on. Come on, king.

31:44.543 --> 31:46.711
Come on, kw, get in.

31:54.803 --> 31:56.221
Rumpus!

32:02.394 --> 32:04.229
Guys! Follow me.

33:22.807 --> 33:24.059
What?

33:24.976 --> 33:28.688
You're funny-looking. That's all.

33:33.902 --> 33:36.947
Hey, king, king, king, watch this.

33:43.745 --> 33:44.871
Hey.

33:45.580 --> 33:47.207
Hey, jumping guy!

33:47.832 --> 33:49.292
Jumping guy!

33:49.459 --> 33:51.378
Hey, mister!

33:53.421 --> 33:54.547
Wait up!

33:58.927 --> 34:01.721
Hey, jumping guy! Hey!

34:01.930 --> 34:04.224
Hey, king, watch this.

34:14.609 --> 34:17.362
All right, tree, we'll settle this later.

34:17.529 --> 34:21.157
Oh, look, everyone wants to be friends
with the new guy.

34:21.533 --> 34:25.786
Well, this is our family. I hope you can
see how excited they are to have a king.

34:25.954 --> 34:27.746
They have an odd way of showing it.

34:27.956 --> 34:33.128
I mean, they act weird, you know,
and can hurt other people's feelings.

34:33.293 --> 34:34.670
- Ira, my love? What?

34:34.838 --> 34:36.005
- Come here. Okay.

34:36.172 --> 34:37.632
Oh, that's Judith and ira.

34:37.966 --> 34:39.259
They're in love.

34:41.219 --> 34:43.096
Hey.

34:43.471 --> 34:44.806
What are you thinking?

34:47.600 --> 34:49.686
Watch me. Look.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.228
That's Alexander.

34:51.396 --> 34:54.858
Look, I hate this tree!

34:55.024 --> 34:57.944
He just wants attention.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

34:58.111 --> 34:59.112
Seventy-seven.

35:00.196 --> 35:02.782
Seventy-eight. No, wait.
No, no. What was that?

35:02.949 --> 35:04.451
- That's Douglas. That was 76.

35:04.659 --> 35:06.619
- I count on him for everything.
- Well...

35:06.828 --> 35:09.664
If I was stranded on an island
and I could only take one thing...

35:09.831 --> 35:10.874
It'd be Douglas.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.042
- We can share him if you want.
- That's good.

35:13.209 --> 35:14.711
I might need one of those.

35:15.545 --> 35:17.338
Douglas, no. No, no, no, stop.

35:17.505 --> 35:19.964
That's not the way I want you
to do it. Here, I'll show you.

35:20.049 --> 35:22.135
Whoa! How did that happen?

35:22.302 --> 35:25.472
It was an accident.
I don't know how that happened.

35:25.847 --> 35:27.765
We haven't formally met.

35:28.016 --> 35:29.350
I'm ira.

35:29.517 --> 35:31.978
I put the holes in the trees.
Maybe you saw those?

35:33.897 --> 35:35.732
- Come here.
- Or maybe not.

35:35.899 --> 35:37.609
Anyways, it's what I do.

35:39.194 --> 35:41.905
It's not really important,
like the things that you do.

35:42.071 --> 35:44.657
Oh, and this is Judith.

35:44.824 --> 35:47.202
You don't really need to know me.
I'm kind of a downer.

35:48.578 --> 35:49.913
King, that's not true.

35:50.079 --> 35:53.166
- Hey, let me see your face.
- You could introduce me if you want.

35:53.374 --> 35:55.210
Here, let me see your face.

35:56.711 --> 35:58.838
What's that? Don't worry. Let me see it.

36:06.721 --> 36:08.723
Whoa!

36:13.645 --> 36:15.438
Good shot, Douglas.

36:15.605 --> 36:17.023
Almost got me.

36:17.190 --> 36:18.733
Almost not good enough.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.526
We'll get him next time, won't we?

36:20.693 --> 36:22.153
Yes. Oh, yes.

36:22.362 --> 36:25.114
We will. We will.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.743
Hey, what you doing?

36:31.955 --> 36:34.874
Is she the one you were mad at
when you were smashing stuff?

36:35.041 --> 36:37.794
Yeah. No, no.

36:37.961 --> 36:39.712
No, it...

36:39.879 --> 36:42.840
I thought she said
she wasn't gonna come back.

36:43.383 --> 36:46.719
- Well, it looks like she's back now.
- Yeah.

36:47.220 --> 36:49.555
Yeah, I hope so.

36:50.264 --> 36:51.307
I'm gonna get her.

36:51.975 --> 36:55.269
No, don't, don't! She doesn't like
that kind of thing. Come back!

36:55.436 --> 36:58.064
Ira, my love, come here.
Hey, king, watch this.

36:58.231 --> 37:01.067
King, I wouldn't recommend that.

37:04.696 --> 37:06.155
Stop it.

37:08.116 --> 37:09.575
Okay, stop it.

37:09.784 --> 37:11.786
Go pick someone else's nose!

37:13.538 --> 37:15.248
Max, look out.

37:15.873 --> 37:16.916
Gotcha.

37:18.501 --> 37:20.169
Whoa!

37:23.464 --> 37:26.676
Alexander, get over there
and be social.

37:30.138 --> 37:32.265
Let's be like this forever!

37:33.307 --> 37:36.102
You guys never think this is me,
but this is really me.

37:36.269 --> 37:39.313
He's starting things off right,
our king.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.649
- Wow, this guy gets things done.
- That was...

37:41.816 --> 37:44.444
- That was great.
- Yeah, that was great.

37:44.652 --> 37:46.779
That was fun.
We forgot how to have fun.

37:46.946 --> 37:48.072
That's true, Carol.

37:48.239 --> 37:50.575
I mean, I didn't, but...
No, you didn't, Carol.

37:50.742 --> 37:51.784
Kw, your toe's in my ear.

37:52.076 --> 37:53.578
Good, you're keeping it warm.

37:53.745 --> 37:55.246
Hey, who's on my face? Stop.

37:55.455 --> 37:57.623
Oh, I'm sorry, Carol. It is you.
Oh, let me move.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.961
Oh, I like this.
Let's be like this forever.

38:02.170 --> 38:03.880
King having a problem?

38:04.046 --> 38:06.174
My foot's stuck under this fat guy.

38:08.885 --> 38:10.470
There.

38:10.678 --> 38:12.638
- Thanks.
- I'm kw.

38:13.181 --> 38:16.392
- I'm Max.
- I know.

38:17.852 --> 38:20.188
Hey, so are you gonna stay?

38:21.522 --> 38:23.149
- Well...
- They all want you to.

38:23.357 --> 38:28.070
It's complicated. I don't even know
how everything got this way.

38:28.738 --> 38:30.198
Things seem better now, though.

38:30.865 --> 38:33.117
Yeah, well, they are.

38:34.494 --> 38:35.870
Okay, king.

38:36.037 --> 38:38.539
Hey, who are Bob and Terry?

38:38.706 --> 38:41.417
Oh, they're really good friends of mine.

38:41.584 --> 38:43.544
I don't even know how to describe them.

38:43.711 --> 38:47.256
They're just different
from everybody here.

38:47.423 --> 38:48.841
It's just different.

38:50.134 --> 38:53.554
- Well, do you like them more than...?
- You ask a lot of questions.

38:53.721 --> 38:57.183
So, what's your story?
Why'd you come here?

38:57.350 --> 38:58.976
Well...

38:59.143 --> 39:02.730
Well, I'm an explorer, and I travel a lot.

39:03.022 --> 39:04.732
- And I travel by sea.
- Right.

39:04.899 --> 39:06.275
I used to travel by air.

39:06.442 --> 39:09.320
So obviously you have
no home or family.

39:11.072 --> 39:13.741
I had one of those, but...

39:14.825 --> 39:16.953
- But you ate them all?
- No.

39:17.119 --> 39:20.373
No, I just bit one of them,
that's all, and...

39:21.040 --> 39:22.959
They went crazy.

39:25.586 --> 39:26.587
And...

39:28.464 --> 39:31.175
I don't like frozen corn.

39:31.926 --> 39:33.552
I'm sorry.

39:33.719 --> 39:35.429
That's why you left?

39:37.223 --> 39:40.226
They act like I'm a bad person.

39:40.768 --> 39:42.228
Well, are you?

39:42.395 --> 39:44.313
I don't know.

39:45.481 --> 39:47.441
I don't know.

39:48.651 --> 39:52.154
Well, I'm glad you came.

39:52.363 --> 39:54.991
It'll be good to have someone around
who doesn't eat everybody.

39:55.157 --> 39:56.909
I mean, you just bite everyone.

39:57.076 --> 40:00.454
But biters aren't so bad.
Eaters are the ones I just can't stand.

40:00.621 --> 40:03.165
I have no plans to eat anybody.

40:03.332 --> 40:06.293
All right. Good.

40:06.460 --> 40:09.505
Well, good night.

40:16.429 --> 40:18.681
Good night, kw.

40:18.848 --> 40:20.891
Good night. Good night, ira.

40:21.058 --> 40:23.561
Night. Good night, Douglas.

40:23.728 --> 40:26.689
Good night, Carol.
Good night, Judith.

40:26.856 --> 40:29.775
Good night. Good night, Judy.

40:29.942 --> 40:31.444
Good night, darling.

40:31.652 --> 40:33.654
Good night. Night, Alex.

40:33.821 --> 40:35.322
- Good night, king.
- Night.

40:35.489 --> 40:38.743
Oh, good night, king.
Yeah, good night, king.

40:39.368 --> 40:41.662
Boy, this is nice.

40:42.163 --> 40:44.707
Good night, everybody.

40:44.874 --> 40:47.543
Everybody, sweet dreams.

41:18.365 --> 41:20.326
I didn't wanna wake you up...

41:20.534 --> 41:22.703
But I really wanna show you
something.

41:24.246 --> 41:26.707
- Okay.
- And on our way...

41:27.666 --> 41:30.878
I can show you your kingdom.
This is all yours.

41:31.045 --> 41:33.547
You're the owner of this world.

41:33.714 --> 41:36.091
Everything you see is yours.

41:36.258 --> 41:40.012
Oh, except that hole over there,
that's ira's.

41:40.221 --> 41:43.933
The tree's yours, but the hole is ira's.
But everything else is yours.

41:44.099 --> 41:48.229
Except for that rock over there, that's not
yours. That little rock next to the big rock.

41:48.395 --> 41:50.189
But everything else in the kingdom...

41:50.356 --> 41:53.817
Except for that stick. That little
stick right there, that's not yours.

41:57.404 --> 42:00.115
I want you to be king forever, Max.

42:00.991 --> 42:03.994
Yeah. Definitely.

42:08.374 --> 42:09.917
Well...

42:10.084 --> 42:12.878
This part of your kingdom's
not so good.

42:13.045 --> 42:14.380
Why?

42:14.546 --> 42:18.008
Well, look. This used to be all rock,
and now it's sand.

42:18.175 --> 42:22.721
And then one day it's gonna be dust. And
then the whole island will be dust and...

42:24.014 --> 42:27.226
And then I don't even know
what comes after dust.

42:33.148 --> 42:35.067
Carol?

42:35.234 --> 42:37.695
Did you know the sun was gonna die?

42:38.195 --> 42:39.863
What?

42:43.826 --> 42:46.078
I never heard that.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.126
Oh, come on.

42:53.002 --> 42:55.087
That can't happen.

42:55.879 --> 42:59.925
I mean, you're the king,
and look at me. I'm big.

43:01.552 --> 43:07.641
How could guys like us worry about
a tiny little thing like the sun?

43:21.113 --> 43:23.032
Carol, what's that?

43:23.198 --> 43:25.284
Oh, it's that dog.

43:25.576 --> 43:28.662
Don't feed it, it'll just
follow you around.

43:38.088 --> 43:40.799
Carol, wait up for me.

44:28.555 --> 44:30.557
Wow.

44:40.943 --> 44:43.195
Did you make this?

44:43.779 --> 44:45.822
Yeah, yeah.

44:46.490 --> 44:48.825
It's very good.

44:53.747 --> 44:57.000
We were gonna make
a whole world like this, but...

44:57.251 --> 44:59.545
Everyone used to come here...

45:00.587 --> 45:02.506
But, you know...

45:03.966 --> 45:07.970
You know what it feels like when all
your teeth are falling out really slowly...

45:08.136 --> 45:10.806
And you don't realize...

45:10.973 --> 45:15.477
And then you notice that,
well, they're really far apart?

45:17.604 --> 45:19.606
And then one day...

45:21.483 --> 45:24.111
You don't have any teeth anymore.

45:26.029 --> 45:27.281
Yeah.

45:27.948 --> 45:30.075
Well, it was like that.

45:31.535 --> 45:34.705
All right, put your head right here.

45:34.871 --> 45:36.581
Right here.

45:49.052 --> 45:50.637
All right, now watch.

46:08.613 --> 46:11.825
Wow. I wish I could live in there.

46:12.576 --> 46:14.161
Yeah.

46:15.704 --> 46:19.166
It was gonna be a place where only
the things you wanted to have happen...

46:19.333 --> 46:20.625
Would happen.

46:21.209 --> 46:22.878
Yeah.

46:23.337 --> 46:27.090
I guess if that's not gonna happen, I'll
just probably end up eating my feet off.

46:35.348 --> 46:38.769
Carol, we can totally build a place
like that.

46:41.104 --> 46:43.774
- Really?
- We're gonna start with the perfect fort.

46:43.940 --> 46:46.443
And then we're gonna
build the city around it...

46:46.610 --> 46:48.278
Because we've gotta be realistic.

46:48.445 --> 46:50.822
I mean, we need to start with
the perfect fort...

46:51.031 --> 46:53.033
Then we'll build
the underground complex...

46:53.200 --> 46:54.910
That's gonna tie everything together.

46:56.286 --> 46:58.080
I like your brain, Max.

46:58.997 --> 47:01.666
Hey! I'm not gonna
eat my feet off anymore.

47:01.833 --> 47:04.461
- Well, why?
- Max is gonna build a fortress.

47:04.628 --> 47:08.048
Yeah, it's gonna be as tall as
12 of you and six of me.

47:08.215 --> 47:11.218
And only we can get in.
We can have an ice cream parlor.

47:11.384 --> 47:13.678
A swimming pool with a bottom
that's a trampoline.

47:13.845 --> 47:16.014
Hey, where were you?
We were just here.

47:16.223 --> 47:19.851
And anyone who gets in that we don't
want there will get their brains cut out.

47:20.018 --> 47:23.480
- The building will do it automatically.
- How's it know which brains to cut?

47:23.647 --> 47:27.984
Okay, so there will be a tree,
but it's a fake tree with a tunnel.

47:35.492 --> 47:37.994
So anyways, it's not a tree,
it's a tunnel.

47:38.203 --> 47:41.206
And it'll lead you into the fort
through a compartment.

47:41.414 --> 47:45.043
Ira, do you wanna be in charge of
the tunnels because you make great holes?

47:45.252 --> 47:46.378
Wow. Wow.

47:46.586 --> 47:49.586
- I don't want my brains cut out.
- This fort is already making me happy.

47:49.756 --> 47:50.924
Does anybody ever hear me?

47:51.091 --> 47:55.220
We'll take care of each other, and
we'll all sleep together in a real pile.

47:55.595 --> 47:58.139
- What do you think?
- I don't think anything like this...

47:58.306 --> 48:00.851
Ever works, really. If it did...

48:01.017 --> 48:03.270
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know anything.

48:03.436 --> 48:05.689
- But I do like sleeping in a real pile.
- Carol...

48:05.856 --> 48:07.899
Will you be in charge of building it?

48:09.442 --> 48:12.779
You should definitely be in charge.
You're the only one who can pull it off.

48:12.946 --> 48:15.574
Yeah, well, you're right, but...

48:15.740 --> 48:18.827
Kw, don't you think
that Carol should build it?

48:19.369 --> 48:22.372
Yeah. He's the only one who can.

48:22.581 --> 48:24.040
I'll build it if he doesn't wanna.

48:24.249 --> 48:26.126
Wow.

48:26.293 --> 48:27.502
You really wanna do this?

48:27.961 --> 48:29.921
- Oh, yeah.
- I think it's a perfect idea.

48:30.088 --> 48:32.882
Well, all right. If you wanna do it...

48:34.134 --> 48:36.011
And you want me...

48:36.553 --> 48:38.388
I'd be honored.

48:39.639 --> 48:41.641
- Judy, you would have been good too.
- Yeah.

48:45.645 --> 48:48.064
How about a window here?
We'll put it here.

48:48.231 --> 48:51.776
We'll put the doorway over here.
And your room'll be here.

48:59.492 --> 49:03.288
Just a little more that way.
A little more. Yeah, right there.

49:13.882 --> 49:15.383
Yeah!

49:23.683 --> 49:26.561
How about here? You like it here?
We have to Mark there...

49:26.728 --> 49:29.856
One Mark there, and then
we can have the other Mark over there.

49:30.023 --> 49:32.192
Yeah. A little more this way.

49:32.525 --> 49:34.277
Oh, that's five, Carol.

49:34.444 --> 49:36.821
Seven douglases across,
we'll have the other Mark.

49:37.030 --> 49:38.698
- What have you been eating?
- Rocks.

49:38.865 --> 49:40.992
Rocks. What did I tell you
about eating rocks?

49:41.159 --> 49:43.661
That's six.
You're getting a little paunch.

49:44.287 --> 49:46.498
- Hey, kw. Hey, king.

49:46.706 --> 49:49.042
How about here?
We need seven douglases.

49:49.209 --> 49:50.502
No more and no less.

49:51.252 --> 49:53.505
Seven chubby douglases.
Hey, Carol.

49:53.713 --> 49:58.009
It's gonna be part castle, part fort,
part mountain and part ship.

49:59.177 --> 50:03.014
<i>We'll have a laboratory where we
can build robots to do stuff for us...</i>

50:04.224 --> 50:06.351
<i>Our own detective agency...</i>

50:06.518 --> 50:07.602
<i>And our own language.</i>

50:07.811 --> 50:11.022
<i>And we'll make a machine
that can take our legs off...</i>

50:11.189 --> 50:12.732
<i>And that way, we can float.</i>

50:15.735 --> 50:17.278
All right, Carol!

50:17.612 --> 50:19.531
You smiled.

50:19.739 --> 50:21.699
You can't deny that
this was a good idea.

50:21.908 --> 50:23.076
I didn't deny it.

50:24.828 --> 50:27.455
I believe part of that idea was mine.

50:28.832 --> 50:30.083
What part?

50:30.250 --> 50:32.210
The part where I said,
"yeah, good idea."

50:48.518 --> 50:49.894
I got it.

50:50.270 --> 50:51.729
Got it.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.067
Judith, that tickles. Ha-ha.

51:04.868 --> 51:06.369
I like the tunnel, ira.

51:06.578 --> 51:08.413
- Oh. Impressive.

51:08.580 --> 51:10.373
Why, thank you, king.

51:13.793 --> 51:16.629
Great beams, Douglas. Strong.

51:17.922 --> 51:22.135
Thanks.
Just the standard beams I always do.

52:10.016 --> 52:12.644
Psst. Psst.

52:24.739 --> 52:26.824
What were you doing with Carol
just now?

52:27.033 --> 52:28.659
Just talking.

52:29.035 --> 52:31.120
Oh, a secret, huh?

52:31.287 --> 52:33.831
Let me ask you something.
How does it work around here?

52:34.040 --> 52:36.876
Are we all the same
or are some of us better than others or...?

52:37.043 --> 52:39.921
You like to play favorites,
huh, king?

52:40.588 --> 52:42.507
No, I like all you guys equally.

52:42.715 --> 52:45.510
Don't give me that.
I can see how it is.

52:45.718 --> 52:48.054
The king has favorites.
That's really cute.

52:48.221 --> 52:50.890
Stop! Do you have a favorite color?

52:51.391 --> 52:52.934
Hey, can I be your favorite color?

53:14.956 --> 53:16.207
You know what?

53:16.916 --> 53:18.459
You can't do that back to me.

53:19.585 --> 53:22.380
If we're upset, your job is
not to get upset back at us.

53:22.797 --> 53:25.341
Our job is to be upset.

53:25.591 --> 53:28.010
If I get mad and wanna eat you,
then you have to say:

53:28.177 --> 53:30.680
"Oh, okay. You can eat me.

53:30.888 --> 53:33.891
I love you.
Whatever makes you happy, Judith."

53:34.350 --> 53:36.144
That's what you're supposed to do!

53:39.522 --> 53:41.649
Come on, Max,
let's go get those sticks.

53:41.816 --> 53:44.068
Yeah. Okay.

53:44.277 --> 53:45.444
I hope you heard me, king.

53:46.612 --> 53:48.656
Yeah, he heard you, Judith.

53:48.823 --> 53:51.075
Everyone always hears you.

53:53.452 --> 53:55.246
You think you have power, kw?

53:55.454 --> 53:57.790
That's not real power.

53:59.083 --> 54:01.169
I'm talking to you!

54:01.335 --> 54:02.587
No! Not you.

54:02.795 --> 54:04.922
I'm still talking to kw.

54:11.596 --> 54:14.056
Don't worry about Judith. She's...

54:14.265 --> 54:15.933
A downer.

54:16.851 --> 54:18.811
No, you'll figure it out.

54:19.312 --> 54:23.232
Hey, you should talk to Bob and Terry
about it. Come on.

54:24.650 --> 54:25.902
King.

54:31.532 --> 54:33.951
Seriously, they're really smart.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.245
They have the answers to everything.

55:44.313 --> 55:46.023
Hold on, hold on.

55:46.232 --> 55:47.858
I'm coming.

55:55.241 --> 55:57.868
Well, what do you think?

56:02.164 --> 56:04.583
This is Bob and Terry.

56:06.669 --> 56:09.130
They love it when I do this to them.

56:09.922 --> 56:12.758
Bob, Terry, this is Max.

56:12.925 --> 56:14.969
He's the biter I was telling you about.

56:17.805 --> 56:19.515
Say hi.

56:19.682 --> 56:21.142
Hi.

56:21.851 --> 56:24.728
He wanted to ask you guys some advice.

56:27.106 --> 56:30.359
Go ahead. They're not judgmental.

56:30.526 --> 56:34.113
- You mean just ask them?
- Yeah.

56:36.282 --> 56:40.244
They say it's better for you if you
can ask the question in seven words.

56:42.872 --> 56:46.000
Um... okay.

56:53.465 --> 56:55.217
How...

56:55.384 --> 56:57.261
Do...

56:58.804 --> 57:01.098
I make...

57:01.849 --> 57:04.018
Everyone...

57:07.313 --> 57:09.648
Okay?

57:12.568 --> 57:15.112
Oh, yeah. I didn't think of that.

57:17.114 --> 57:19.658
Wow, they really get to
the heart of it, don't they?

57:20.367 --> 57:22.411
Aren't they great?

57:22.912 --> 57:24.788
What if they came and lived with us?

57:24.997 --> 57:28.792
Bob, Terry, why don't you come live
with us? We're building something great.

57:30.502 --> 57:33.130
Oh, good. Right, Max?

57:35.049 --> 57:38.802
Well, what about Carol?

57:39.136 --> 57:41.055
He's Carol.

57:42.806 --> 57:45.809
I can like him and still be friends
with Bob and Terry.

58:07.623 --> 58:09.333
Hey, Douglas!

58:09.708 --> 58:12.002
Hey! Where's Carol?

58:12.169 --> 58:13.796
He's in the fort!

58:13.963 --> 58:17.299
Aft section, main chamber.

58:27.267 --> 58:29.520
Carol! Carol! The fort looks great.

58:29.728 --> 58:34.149
Yeah. Thanks. We're all working
really hard on it. Where you been?

58:34.566 --> 58:38.362
Well, kw took me to see her friends,
Bob and Terry.

58:38.529 --> 58:41.699
They really wanna meet you.
They may even stay over.

58:47.913 --> 58:50.374
Oh, this is the famous Bob and Terry?

58:50.666 --> 58:53.419
- What? Kw told you about me?
- Hi, guys.

58:53.585 --> 58:54.670
What'd she say?

58:57.214 --> 58:59.800
Oh, precious little
Bob and Terry get carried.

59:01.885 --> 59:02.886
Excuse me... my voice?

59:03.095 --> 59:06.890
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, sometimes I...

59:11.228 --> 59:14.064
I know, I know. I am a very lucky man.

59:14.231 --> 59:17.276
Hey, hey, do you guys know any jokes?

59:20.237 --> 59:21.738
Who's there?

59:22.281 --> 59:24.241
Loud interrupting cow...

59:26.368 --> 59:28.537
That's hilarious.

59:29.079 --> 59:30.539
They're amazing, kw.

59:30.747 --> 59:33.417
Max, what's wrong with the fort?

59:33.584 --> 59:36.712
- I thought you said it'd be automatic.
- What?

59:36.879 --> 59:40.048
Well, I thought you said if anybody
got in here we didn't want...

59:40.215 --> 59:42.634
The fort would automatically
cut their brains out.

59:42.801 --> 59:46.096
- Carol.
- Oh, well...

59:47.264 --> 59:49.349
I thought that then, but...

59:50.225 --> 59:52.895
I kind of decided
that if we know them...

59:53.061 --> 59:55.314
They should keep their brains.

59:58.734 --> 01:00:01.278
Even if we don't know them that well.

01:00:03.488 --> 01:00:06.241
I think you should apologize
to Bob and Terry.

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:08.744
I don't apologize to owls.

01:00:08.911 --> 01:00:10.579
Owls are stupid.

01:00:10.746 --> 01:00:12.915
Carol, that's hateful.

01:00:13.707 --> 01:00:15.250
Why would you bring them here?

01:00:16.919 --> 01:00:20.172
Huh? This place was supposed to be for us.

01:00:21.506 --> 01:00:24.051
They are not sleeping in our pile.

01:00:30.098 --> 01:00:33.185
Gee, you're the best king ever.

01:00:33.352 --> 01:00:35.812
You've changed everything.

01:00:59.544 --> 01:01:01.338
Hey, Carol.

01:01:02.756 --> 01:01:05.926
I don't get why she likes them
so much.

01:01:07.302 --> 01:01:09.805
And I couldn't even understand
what they were saying.

01:01:09.972 --> 01:01:12.432
All I heard was squeaking.

01:01:16.979 --> 01:01:19.856
I couldn't really understand
what they were saying either.

01:01:20.857 --> 01:01:22.651
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:30.325
Everybody's mad at me.

01:01:35.872 --> 01:01:40.544
Is there anything you can do to,
you know?

01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:48.719
There's something I like to do
that sometimes makes me feel better.

01:01:50.846 --> 01:01:51.847
What is it?

01:01:53.557 --> 01:01:54.975
Okay, we're gonna have a war.

01:01:55.142 --> 01:01:57.978
And we're gonna completely clobber
each other.

01:01:59.396 --> 01:02:00.564
Clobber each other?

01:02:00.772 --> 01:02:03.024
Yeah, with huge dirt clods.

01:02:03.191 --> 01:02:05.902
I used to do it a ton
when I was a little kid.

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:08.989
Yep, we've not had a dirt-clod fight
in a long time.

01:02:09.156 --> 01:02:11.199
Yeah. It's the best way
to have fun together.

01:02:11.408 --> 01:02:14.619
Yeah, life was simpler back then
with the dirt clods.

01:02:14.786 --> 01:02:17.539
- Yeah.
- So who wants to be a bad guy?

01:02:21.543 --> 01:02:23.879
Okay. I'll pick one, then.

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:28.133
- Okay, you're a bad guy.
- Yeah, I saw that coming.

01:02:28.717 --> 01:02:31.303
And then you're definitely a bad guy.

01:02:31.595 --> 01:02:34.473
- What? Damn.
- And you can pick one other.

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.434
- I'll be bad. Really.
- Okay, we pick you.

01:02:37.601 --> 01:02:41.897
No. No, I can't be a bad guy.
I'm the king. I'm a good guy.

01:02:42.063 --> 01:02:45.484
- I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. A bad guy.
- Okay, you can be a bad guy.

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:47.736
- Judy, I'm with you.
- Yeah, I heard.

01:02:47.903 --> 01:02:48.904
And you, uh...

01:02:51.948 --> 01:02:54.159
- He's with you.
- Am I a good guy?

01:02:54.326 --> 01:02:57.120
Yes, of course. You have the best arm.

01:02:57.329 --> 01:02:58.788
Hey, where were you?

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:01.791
I was just making sure Bob and Terry
still have their brains.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.835
- Kw!
- They do.

01:03:04.002 --> 01:03:07.631
Hey, kw, you wanna be on my team?
We're the bad guys.

01:03:07.839 --> 01:03:10.800
No! No, no. No, you're with us.
You're a good guy.

01:03:11.468 --> 01:03:14.804
Yeah, come on, kw, be a good guy.

01:03:15.013 --> 01:03:17.307
Okay, so you're on my team.

01:03:17.516 --> 01:03:20.143
You and me and Carol.

01:03:20.894 --> 01:03:22.562
Hi, kw.

01:03:24.856 --> 01:03:28.652
So, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna try to kill the bad guys...

01:03:28.818 --> 01:03:31.947
By beaning them in the head
with these dirt clods.

01:03:32.113 --> 01:03:35.116
We're gonna try to find
the biggest pieces...

01:03:35.951 --> 01:03:37.671
- Whoa!
- Ha-ha! You didn't see that coming!

01:03:38.119 --> 01:03:40.121
Run for cover! Run!

01:03:40.288 --> 01:03:41.498
You'd better run.

01:03:41.665 --> 01:03:45.502
Hey, wait. You didn't make
the official starting noise.

01:03:45.835 --> 01:03:47.003
Sorry.

01:03:47.337 --> 01:03:49.256
Run! Come on!

01:03:56.054 --> 01:03:59.557
Look out for the bad guys.

01:04:04.062 --> 01:04:07.274
We got them pinned down.
They can't even move.

01:04:08.233 --> 01:04:09.985
- Fire on three!
- Okay.

01:04:10.151 --> 01:04:13.446
One, two, three!

01:04:13.613 --> 01:04:15.281
You guys are gonna...

01:04:23.415 --> 01:04:26.626
Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.878
Come out!

01:04:30.005 --> 01:04:31.673
No!

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.717
Why not?

01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:37.137
Uh, because you're gonna hit us
in the head with dirt.

01:04:38.763 --> 01:04:40.974
Come out!

01:04:41.766 --> 01:04:43.351
No!

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.228
Why not?

01:04:45.395 --> 01:04:48.648
When I said you were gonna hit us
in the head, you didn't say anything!

01:04:48.815 --> 01:04:52.360
That means you're planning
to hit us in the head with dirt!

01:04:54.529 --> 01:04:57.907
- Man, they really have us figured out.
- Yeah.

01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:02.078
Okay. Let's go!

01:05:02.287 --> 01:05:03.830
Charge!

01:05:06.332 --> 01:05:08.168
Ira! Get Carol.

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:12.547
Good shot. I'm gonna get you!

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.437
Hey. Who threw Richard?

01:05:27.896 --> 01:05:29.856
Well, he's on our team now.

01:05:33.318 --> 01:05:35.612
- Gotcha. No animals!

01:05:36.321 --> 01:05:37.947
It really hurts! It's hurting!

01:05:47.957 --> 01:05:50.126
- Hey, Douglas. Get the goat.
- Okay.

01:05:50.335 --> 01:05:52.545
- Knock his legs out.
- Got it.

01:05:55.423 --> 01:05:57.634
That's cheating!
I'm not gonna play anymore!

01:05:57.842 --> 01:05:59.928
- Alexander, come on. Fight with us.
- Do it again.

01:06:02.305 --> 01:06:07.185
- That's... that's not fair! Are you crazy?
- You're supposed to get hit. It's a war.

01:06:07.352 --> 01:06:09.854
That wasn't fair. Douglas hit me
when I was hurt.

01:06:10.021 --> 01:06:12.690
You can't hit someone
when they're hurt. I quit.

01:06:12.857 --> 01:06:14.359
Get back in here, right now.

01:06:14.526 --> 01:06:17.820
- Alex, count to 10. Things will get better.
- Alexander, don't you cry!

01:06:17.987 --> 01:06:19.822
If I count to 10, will you be gone, ira?

01:06:20.031 --> 01:06:22.659
- Don't you dare talk to ira the way I do.
- Knock it off!

01:06:22.867 --> 01:06:26.704
- That's my eye. Run! Come on.

01:06:26.871 --> 01:06:27.997
Look out! Run.

01:06:45.723 --> 01:06:47.725
Oh, Carol. I'm sorry.

01:06:50.853 --> 01:06:53.982
What happened? Ha-ha-ha.
Somebody step on your head?

01:06:54.148 --> 01:06:56.192
What are you doing?

01:06:56.567 --> 01:06:58.861
- What?
- Don't step on my head.

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:02.907
What do you mean? It's a war.
Douglas just did it.

01:07:03.074 --> 01:07:06.160
Yeah, but he did it by accident,
you did it on purpose.

01:07:06.703 --> 01:07:10.164
And he didn't step on
the face part of my head.

01:07:10.832 --> 01:07:13.209
It was a joke.

01:07:13.543 --> 01:07:15.128
I was just joking.

01:07:15.295 --> 01:07:16.671
Sure you were.

01:07:16.838 --> 01:07:21.050
Like you aren't always looking for
the opportunity to step on my head.

01:07:21.217 --> 01:07:23.386
Because that's what you do.

01:07:26.931 --> 01:07:28.725
Fine. Fine. You know what?

01:07:28.933 --> 01:07:32.645
This is exactly why I don't ever wanna
do anything with you anymore.

01:07:33.021 --> 01:07:34.731
Go ahead.

01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:36.899
Step on my head.

01:07:37.817 --> 01:07:42.363
No, forget it. I'm not gonna step on
your head just to make you feel better.

01:07:46.117 --> 01:07:47.201
Let's go, Douglas.

01:07:47.368 --> 01:07:50.121
Carol, I think you did the right thing.

01:07:50.288 --> 01:07:52.915
You know, not stepping on her head.

01:08:14.771 --> 01:08:16.606
Thanks, Max.

01:08:16.814 --> 01:08:18.941
But I'm done.

01:08:19.817 --> 01:08:22.569
I don't know why I came back here.

01:08:23.529 --> 01:08:25.990
I'm glad I met you, I guess.

01:08:40.004 --> 01:08:41.589
So, king, what's going on?

01:08:41.798 --> 01:08:44.466
This is how you rule a kingdom?
Everyone fighting?

01:08:45.009 --> 01:08:48.345
The bad guys feel bad.
Hell, everyone feels bad.

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:53.768
Yeah, I'm still sort of dizzy.
My eyeballs feel loose.

01:08:53.935 --> 01:08:56.979
Can it, ira.
Everyone's eyeballs feel loose.

01:08:57.188 --> 01:08:58.481
No.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:03.027
Max'll bring kw back.

01:09:03.194 --> 01:09:05.196
He'll keep us all together.

01:09:05.363 --> 01:09:08.407
He has powers. He told us.

01:09:08.573 --> 01:09:09.826
Right, Max?

01:09:10.827 --> 01:09:12.703
Show us.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:43.943
Uh-oh. Somebody broke the king.

01:09:44.234 --> 01:09:48.781
I don't get it. Oh, wait, I do.
It's stupid.

01:09:52.243 --> 01:09:54.620
I think he's done now.

01:09:55.288 --> 01:09:57.873
That's what we waited for?

01:10:43.377 --> 01:10:45.755
Carol?

01:12:03.874 --> 01:12:05.167
Hi.

01:12:42.246 --> 01:12:45.666
- Is that from the dirt clods?
- Yeah.

01:12:45.874 --> 01:12:49.461
It's from when you had Douglas hit me.

01:12:52.214 --> 01:12:54.717
I'm sorry about that.

01:12:58.804 --> 01:13:00.973
It's okay.

01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:07.229
No one really listens to you, huh?

01:13:07.396 --> 01:13:09.064
Oh, you've noticed.

01:13:10.983 --> 01:13:15.904
Yeah, I guess you're not used to that,
being a king and all.

01:13:24.246 --> 01:13:27.082
I really messed this place up.

01:13:33.297 --> 01:13:37.343
You're not really a king, huh?

01:13:38.802 --> 01:13:41.138
You're just regular.

01:13:45.434 --> 01:13:47.519
I knew it.

01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:51.273
I don't even know
if there is such a thing...

01:13:51.482 --> 01:13:56.195
As a king who can do
all the things you said.

01:13:57.905 --> 01:14:01.784
Look, I don't care.

01:14:02.826 --> 01:14:04.953
Just don't ever let Carol find out.

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.216
He's a terrible king.

01:14:20.469 --> 01:14:22.638
Where is he from?

01:14:22.846 --> 01:14:24.515
Where does he go?

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.185
Why isn't he helping us?

01:14:33.148 --> 01:14:35.484
I wanna eat them up.

01:14:56.421 --> 01:14:57.589
Hey, Max...

01:14:59.049 --> 01:15:00.592
What's that?

01:15:01.009 --> 01:15:04.388
Well, I was thinking we needed
a place...

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.890
Where the king is secret.

01:15:07.057 --> 01:15:09.518
Like a secret chamber for the king.

01:15:10.352 --> 01:15:12.813
Well, I don't understand. What...?

01:15:13.063 --> 01:15:16.316
Well, you know, like a small place...

01:15:16.525 --> 01:15:19.319
With a door that's not so big.

01:15:19.903 --> 01:15:21.530
I don't know.

01:15:21.738 --> 01:15:24.908
I didn't picture it with secret doors.

01:15:29.371 --> 01:15:33.667
What if it were a big place
with big secret doors?

01:15:34.918 --> 01:15:38.839
That... that's not really
how it would be done.

01:15:39.089 --> 01:15:42.009
It's more like... it's like a...

01:15:48.223 --> 01:15:50.058
About that big?

01:16:01.403 --> 01:16:03.697
<i>Everybody get out here.</i>

01:16:05.324 --> 01:16:07.117
Wake up.

01:16:07.576 --> 01:16:09.703
Everybody wake up!

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.247
All right, get out here!

01:16:13.707 --> 01:16:14.708
Ira, what is that?

01:16:14.916 --> 01:16:16.793
Everybody, wake up. It's Carol.

01:16:17.878 --> 01:16:19.254
I knew it was gonna happen.

01:16:19.421 --> 01:16:20.589
Judy, Judy.

01:16:20.797 --> 01:16:24.009
It's all wrong.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:16:24.176 --> 01:16:26.219
Judith, what's happening right now?

01:16:26.386 --> 01:16:27.387
Judith?

01:16:27.679 --> 01:16:28.930
Wake up and come out here.

01:16:29.139 --> 01:16:30.641
What is it? What's he saying?

01:16:30.807 --> 01:16:32.184
Get out here!

01:16:32.351 --> 01:16:34.394
What's he talking about?
It's wrong.

01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:35.937
I can't even look at it.

01:16:36.146 --> 01:16:37.606
What is it? The fort.

01:16:37.773 --> 01:16:39.900
- We gotta tear the fort down.
- What?

01:16:40.067 --> 01:16:42.486
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
No, Carol.

01:16:42.653 --> 01:16:45.280
You said we were all gonna sleep
together in a real pile.

01:16:45.447 --> 01:16:47.574
And now you want a secret room.

01:16:47.741 --> 01:16:49.117
And kw's gone for good.

01:16:49.284 --> 01:16:51.828
Now I have to worry if the sun
is gonna die. Look at it.

01:16:51.995 --> 01:16:53.580
It didn't come up. It's dead.

01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:54.831
What? It's dark.

01:16:54.998 --> 01:16:56.041
- Oh, my god.
- Dead?

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:58.043
- Carol, stop!
- It's dead. It's dead.

01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:00.379
- You're scaring everybody.
- It's morning.

01:17:00.545 --> 01:17:02.589
The sun's not dead,
it's just nighttime.

01:17:02.798 --> 01:17:05.300
How do you know?
I can't trust what you say.

01:17:06.051 --> 01:17:09.262
Everything keeps changing. All right,
come on, we're ripping it down.

01:17:09.429 --> 01:17:11.431
Carol, we're not ripping the fort down!

01:17:11.598 --> 01:17:15.310
It was supposed to be where only things
you wanted to happen would happen.

01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:17.145
Come on, Douglas,
do what I tell you.

01:17:17.312 --> 01:17:20.732
No! We all live here, not just you.

01:17:21.483 --> 01:17:24.194
It... it's everybody's.
Judith and ira and everybody.

01:17:24.361 --> 01:17:26.947
- Oh, finally.
- You were supposed to keep us safe...

01:17:27.114 --> 01:17:28.990
And take care of us, and you didn't.

01:17:29.199 --> 01:17:30.409
- Carol.
- I'm sorry!

01:17:30.575 --> 01:17:32.369
- That's not good enough. Carol.

01:17:32.702 --> 01:17:34.204
You're a terrible king.

01:17:34.371 --> 01:17:35.580
Carol! What?

01:17:37.499 --> 01:17:39.835
- He's not our king. What?

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.922
Don't say that. How could you say that?
Don't you dare say that.

01:17:44.089 --> 01:17:46.800
There's no such thing as a king.

01:17:46.967 --> 01:17:48.176
Don't you say that.

01:17:48.343 --> 01:17:53.473
He's just a boy pretending to be a wolf
pretending to be a king.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.808
That's not true.

01:17:54.975 --> 01:17:57.853
- He's just like us.
- Oh, why don't I listen to myself?

01:17:58.019 --> 01:17:59.020
That's not true!

01:17:59.229 --> 01:18:02.524
Look, I just went along with it
because I knew you wanted it so much.

01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:05.152
- Don't say that!
- Don't! Carol, stop it!

01:18:06.361 --> 01:18:08.071
- Oh, no!
- Stop it, what are you doing?

01:18:08.238 --> 01:18:09.322
Carol! What?

01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:11.366
That was my favorite arm.

01:18:11.533 --> 01:18:13.994
Well, I was just holding onto it.
You pulled away.

01:18:14.161 --> 01:18:15.162
- What?
- Carol, stop it!

01:18:15.662 --> 01:18:17.455
- You lied?
- You're out of control!

01:18:17.622 --> 01:18:19.207
I'm not out of control.

01:18:19.374 --> 01:18:21.960
You were supposed to take care of us.
You promised!

01:18:22.169 --> 01:18:24.087
I'll eat you up!

01:18:42.022 --> 01:18:43.857
Come back here!

01:18:49.112 --> 01:18:50.739
Max!

01:18:50.947 --> 01:18:52.532
Max!

01:18:56.286 --> 01:18:58.455
Come on. Come here.

01:19:03.627 --> 01:19:04.794
Get in. Get inside.

01:19:06.212 --> 01:19:08.924
Get in. Crawl inside my mouth.
I'll hide you.

01:19:09.299 --> 01:19:10.383
Max!

01:19:24.731 --> 01:19:25.940
Hi, Richard.

01:19:26.107 --> 01:19:28.068
Max!

01:19:29.152 --> 01:19:30.320
- Where is he? I don't know.

01:19:30.487 --> 01:19:31.655
Where? I don't know!

01:19:31.821 --> 01:19:33.281
I can smell him!

01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:38.244
- I just wanna talk to him.
- You're out of control!

01:19:38.411 --> 01:19:39.704
I'm not out of control!

01:19:39.871 --> 01:19:41.081
You were gonna eat him.

01:19:41.247 --> 01:19:44.167
No, no. I was... I wasn't gonna...

01:19:44.793 --> 01:19:47.295
I don't know, I just said it!

01:19:52.967 --> 01:19:55.595
Am I as bad as he says I am?

01:19:56.638 --> 01:19:58.765
Just go away.

01:20:00.183 --> 01:20:02.936
I just wanted us all to be together.

01:20:20.662 --> 01:20:23.123
Can you believe him?

01:20:27.502 --> 01:20:30.880
He doesn't mean to be that way, kw.

01:20:35.635 --> 01:20:37.595
He's just scared.

01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:45.645
Well, he only makes it harder.

01:20:46.855 --> 01:20:49.023
And it's hard enough already.

01:20:54.988 --> 01:20:58.700
And he loves you. You're his family.

01:21:01.244 --> 01:21:02.829
Yeah.

01:21:03.663 --> 01:21:06.499
It's hard being a family.

01:21:14.716 --> 01:21:19.304
I can't breathe that well in here.
Can you get me out?

01:21:57.717 --> 01:22:00.303
I wish you guys had a mom.

01:22:08.478 --> 01:22:10.563
I'm gonna go home.

01:22:35.546 --> 01:22:36.798
Carol!

01:23:49.036 --> 01:23:50.496
Max.

01:23:57.545 --> 01:24:00.006
Well, um...

01:24:00.214 --> 01:24:01.799
Yeah.

01:24:03.759 --> 01:24:05.261
Yeah.

01:24:16.856 --> 01:24:20.359
So, what ever happened
with you and the vikings?

01:24:22.528 --> 01:24:24.655
Well, in the end...

01:24:25.239 --> 01:24:27.074
I had to leave.

01:24:27.241 --> 01:24:28.576
Why?

01:24:32.205 --> 01:24:35.208
I'm not a viking or a king...

01:24:36.584 --> 01:24:38.586
Or anything.

01:24:40.796 --> 01:24:42.673
So, what are you?

01:24:51.057 --> 01:24:52.975
I'm Max.

01:24:56.354 --> 01:24:57.897
Well...

01:24:58.272 --> 01:25:00.900
That's not very much, is it?

01:25:34.308 --> 01:25:35.476
Hey, Max?

01:25:37.603 --> 01:25:38.646
Yeah?

01:25:39.647 --> 01:25:41.440
When you go home...

01:25:41.607 --> 01:25:43.818
Will you say good things about us?

01:25:45.111 --> 01:25:47.571
Yeah. I will.

01:25:52.326 --> 01:25:54.578
Thanks, Max.

01:26:20.938 --> 01:26:23.149
You're the first king
we haven't eaten.

01:26:23.315 --> 01:26:25.317
Yeah, it's true.

01:26:30.406 --> 01:26:32.199
See you.

01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:34.034
Bye, Max.

01:26:34.201 --> 01:26:35.703
Bye.

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.156
Don't go.

01:28:36.824 --> 01:28:39.576
I'll eat you up, I love you so.
