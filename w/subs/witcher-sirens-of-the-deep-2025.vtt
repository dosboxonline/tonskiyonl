00:06.625 --> 00:08.625
[mysterious music playing]

00:32.291 --> 00:34.124
[sniffs] Hmm.

00:34.125 --> 00:37.082
- You're not gonna eat that, are you?
- I'm starving.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.290
But not that starving.

00:38.291 --> 00:41.082
[Jaskier] Good,
because that is disgusting.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.999
[Geralt] I'm tracking the monster's scent.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.790
- [Jaskier moans]
- I've only seen an Allamorax in books.

00:45.791 --> 00:48.707
And those shoes
weren't made for climbing rocks.

00:48.708 --> 00:49.791
Wait on shore.

00:50.875 --> 00:54.749
Uh, I need to be amongst the action
to compose a proper ballad.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.540
Besides, I'm more nimble than you'd think.

00:57.541 --> 00:58.749
[Jaskier groans]

00:58.750 --> 00:59.666
[sighs]

01:00.791 --> 01:02.249
- [cracking]
- [Geralt gasps]

01:02.250 --> 01:04.875
- Go!
- I told you. I... [yelps]

01:05.500 --> 01:08.915
[Allamorax roars]

01:08.916 --> 01:12.250
Oh my God. What the fuck is that?

01:13.041 --> 01:15.041
[suspenseful music playing]

01:17.000 --> 01:18.750
- [whimpers]
- [snarls]

01:19.750 --> 01:20.666
[Jaskier gasps]

01:21.250 --> 01:22.083
[Geralt strains]

01:22.916 --> 01:23.790
[straining continues]

01:23.791 --> 01:25.333
[tense music playing]

01:27.166 --> 01:29.040
[strains]

01:29.041 --> 01:30.332
[Allamorax growls]

01:30.333 --> 01:31.666
[Jaskier whimpers]

01:37.375 --> 01:38.499
[Geralt yells]

01:38.500 --> 01:39.833
[strains]

01:43.166 --> 01:45.166
[tense music continues]

01:46.208 --> 01:47.833
[Allamorax growls]

01:48.625 --> 01:49.540
[Geralt grunts]

01:49.541 --> 01:51.833
[tense music continues]

01:55.541 --> 01:56.999
[whimpers]

01:57.000 --> 01:58.708
[tense music continues]

02:02.875 --> 02:03.875
[Geralt yells]

02:04.958 --> 02:06.041
[groans]

02:06.708 --> 02:08.083
[Allamorax growls]

02:09.250 --> 02:11.791
[Geralt grunting]

02:13.208 --> 02:15.208
[tense music continues]

02:24.625 --> 02:25.583
[yells]

02:27.875 --> 02:29.875
[dramatic music playing]

02:37.916 --> 02:40.040
[Geralt grunts]

02:40.041 --> 02:41.750
- [Allamorax roars]
- [Jaskier gasps]

02:42.250 --> 02:44.250
[dramatic music continues]

02:48.750 --> 02:50.208
[Geralt yells]

02:51.833 --> 02:53.833
[Allamorax groans]

02:54.958 --> 02:55.833
[music fades]

02:58.458 --> 03:00.250
[Geralt grunts]

03:04.166 --> 03:05.250
[Geralt grunts]

03:05.833 --> 03:07.082
[Geralt grunts]

03:07.083 --> 03:08.375
[dramatic music playing]

03:10.833 --> 03:11.750
[Geralt grunts]

03:16.458 --> 03:17.583
[Geralt grunts]

03:18.833 --> 03:20.875
[Allamorax roars]

03:21.958 --> 03:24.250
[dramatic music continues]

03:24.875 --> 03:26.083
[yells]

03:31.416 --> 03:32.458
[Geralt gasps]

03:33.125 --> 03:35.541
[dramatic music continues]

03:46.166 --> 03:47.958
[somber music playing]

03:49.958 --> 03:53.208
[breathes heavily]
Nothing personal, big fella.

03:58.750 --> 03:59.833
Show yourself!

04:03.166 --> 04:04.541
[in Merspeak] Have mercy.

04:05.541 --> 04:08.166
That creature means you no harm.

04:09.583 --> 04:16.540
Not say the pearl divers
who hired me to kill it.

04:16.541 --> 04:19.957
This isn't the first attack in the area.

04:19.958 --> 04:22.124
It can barely open its mouth.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.832
[merman] It isn't eating humans.

04:23.833 --> 04:28.415
It's eating oysters
and the divers' precious trinkets inside.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.791
Its only crime is being hungry.

04:33.666 --> 04:35.250
Have mercy.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.624
[Allamorax growls]

04:41.625 --> 04:44.083
But I could use a ride.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.125
[waves splash]

04:59.041 --> 04:59.915
[Jaskier sighs]

04:59.916 --> 05:02.000
[gentle music playing]

05:16.958 --> 05:20.166
[gentle vocalizing]

05:42.458 --> 05:44.458
[gentle music continues]

06:09.125 --> 06:10.124
[music fades]

06:10.125 --> 06:12.208
[merpeople chatter]

06:14.250 --> 06:17.540
[in Merspeak] My children cannot eat
because of those humans!

06:17.541 --> 06:20.665
There are no oysters to be found!

06:20.666 --> 06:24.957
I know you're upset,
but this is not the answer.

06:24.958 --> 06:27.041
[chattering in Merspeak continues]

06:29.666 --> 06:30.875
[merman 1] Silence!

06:32.916 --> 06:36.374
[in English] We've had peace
for too many tides to have it end now.

06:36.375 --> 06:39.915
Let the dark hatreds stay in the past.

06:39.916 --> 06:44.332
This council is doing everything it can
to prevent a war with Bremervoord.

06:44.333 --> 06:48.624
You're not acting because your daughter
is in love with the prince.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.415
The humans know it
and are taking advantage of it.

06:51.416 --> 06:54.207
The humans have moved
beyond pillaging pearls.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.665
They hired a Witcher
to murder the Allamorax.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.582
[merman 2] Witcher?

06:57.583 --> 07:00.790
If one sea creature is in danger,
we all are.

07:00.791 --> 07:02.874
- She's right.
- We have to stop them!

07:02.875 --> 07:04.040
Yes, we must fight!

07:04.041 --> 07:06.040
[merpeople speak over each other]

07:06.041 --> 07:07.750
[merman 3] What kind of king are you?

07:08.416 --> 07:10.790
We shall take
your proposal into consideration.

07:10.791 --> 07:13.499
Mother, you cannot be serious.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.957
Sh'eenaz, you are young and naive.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.165
If a human's mouth opens,

07:19.166 --> 07:21.457
a lie is bound to come forth.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.415
Perhaps it is time
for more drastic measures.

07:24.416 --> 07:27.915
My union with Agloval
could bring peace, not conflict.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.916
I agree with my niece.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.665
Perhaps war is not the answer.
But a wedding--

07:38.666 --> 07:40.874
Be gone from this place, Melusina.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.957
Our daughter could never marry a human.

07:43.958 --> 07:45.749
Not that you could ever understand

07:45.750 --> 07:48.082
the depth
of a mother's love for her child.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.082
Did she just call her barren?

07:50.083 --> 07:51.999
You speak of the past, sister,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
but this is about the future
of our people.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.041
Yes, <i>our</i> people.

07:57.791 --> 08:02.041
I am still a member
of this family and the royal court, Dahut.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.374
Your disdain does not negate that fact.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.499
The only reason you're permitted to live

08:08.500 --> 08:11.791
is because I am keenly aware
of that fact, sister.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.291
Leave. Now.

08:16.916 --> 08:18.749
I will go. Willingly.

08:18.750 --> 08:19.875
Do not fret.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.165
But we both know who he loved first.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.333
[scoffs]

08:27.416 --> 08:28.708
[Dahut roars]

08:37.208 --> 08:40.415
[Jaskier] So let me get this straight.
You had the monster right there,

08:40.416 --> 08:42.624
and you just let it go.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.624
[Geralt] The Allamorax didn't kill anyone.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.790
So the humans are lying?

08:45.791 --> 08:48.290
- [Geralt] Could be.
- Are the merpeople the victims?

08:48.291 --> 08:50.332
- [Geralt] Not necessarily.
- Oh.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.999
- So they're hiding something too?
- Maybe.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.915
No, no, no. No maybes. No maybes.
There is good and there is bad.

08:56.916 --> 08:57.999
It's that simple.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.332
Just make up your mind and kill something.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.250
Here's our finest spread.

09:04.541 --> 09:07.165
[meat sizzles]

09:07.166 --> 09:08.165
[Jaskier] Mm.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.958
[chuckles] Mm.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.707
Ah--

09:12.708 --> 09:15.208
[barkeeper] Too bad you can't afford it.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.166
[Jaskier groans]

09:20.666 --> 09:23.249
This is just like
when we were with that horny bugger

09:23.250 --> 09:24.624
back at the edge of the world.

09:24.625 --> 09:27.540
You're a monster hunter,
but only sometimes, apparently.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.082
And with conditions.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.499
[Geralt] A moral code.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.749
We'll get coin another way.
Somewhere other than Bremervoord.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.540
Salve to my heart, if not my stomach.

09:36.541 --> 09:41.333
We only came to this latrine of a town
to avoid running into you-know-who again.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.374
I don't wanna talk about her.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.290
[scoffs] That violet-eyed witch
dictates where we can or can't go

09:48.291 --> 09:49.749
and how foul a mood you're in.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.708
No more Yennefer.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.250
[liquid splashes]

09:56.333 --> 09:58.333
[gentle music playing]

10:03.333 --> 10:05.833
What's the matter. Water not suit?

10:06.333 --> 10:08.999
It's hot, Yennefer, but murky.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.083
[gentle music continues]

10:29.875 --> 10:32.583
Wouldn't be right
to send you out on a night like this.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.833
You cover the booze. I'll cover the bed.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.374
[Geralt] All I said
was Tretogor's black markets

10:42.375 --> 10:44.999
are for idiots
looking to buy miracle cures,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.832
neither of which I thought applied to you.

10:47.833 --> 10:50.665
A fine reminder that you have no idea
what you're talking about

10:50.666 --> 10:51.832
or who you're dealing with.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.375
I was hoping to remedy that tonight.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.249
[Yennefer] Then another thing
you're wrong about.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.541
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

11:00.708 --> 11:03.582
[flames roar]

11:03.583 --> 11:05.666
[gentle music continues]

11:18.000 --> 11:19.208
[murmurs]

11:25.000 --> 11:25.958
[sighs]

11:27.500 --> 11:28.333
[music stops]

11:28.875 --> 11:30.915
[footsteps approach]

11:30.916 --> 11:31.958
[barkeeper] Have at it.

11:32.833 --> 11:37.915
Look, I'm just saying, your moral code
is getting in the way of my eating.

11:37.916 --> 11:39.624
[bread crunches]

11:39.625 --> 11:42.000
This bread is inedible!

11:42.750 --> 11:43.874
Halfsies?

11:43.875 --> 11:46.082
Hand over the coin
you've been earning, then.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.790
[Jaskier] Harsh. Harsh, but fair.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.707
So I will make you a deal.

11:49.708 --> 11:54.290
I'll take the first job that comes my way
if you agree to do the same.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.875
Codes for none.
Coin for all. What do you think?

11:57.375 --> 11:58.333
[barkeeper] Oi.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.249
You the Witcher they talking about?

12:01.250 --> 12:02.874
What let the monster go?

12:02.875 --> 12:03.874
You are mistaken--

12:03.875 --> 12:06.040
- [Geralt] Yes, that's me.
- Son of a bitch.

12:06.041 --> 12:10.624
A Witcher what won't kill monsters?
Whoever heard of such a thing?

12:10.625 --> 12:13.082
Oy! Welcome to me tavern!

12:13.083 --> 12:15.749
But I don't serve ale! [laughs]

12:15.750 --> 12:21.750
[tavern patrons laugh]

12:23.166 --> 12:25.416
- [barkeeper] Get out, you lazy louts!
- [Jaskier groans]

12:26.000 --> 12:27.833
- [barkeeper] Out!
- [Jaskier groans]

12:28.833 --> 12:32.957
[clears throat] Forgive me,
but are you Jaskier the Bard?

12:32.958 --> 12:37.207
The Song Don of Oxenfurt?
The Crooner of the Continent?

12:37.208 --> 12:40.749
[clears throat] Ooh,
never heard those before, but yes, 'tis I!

12:40.750 --> 12:45.124
[chuckles] Looks like there are green
shoots of culture among the fertilizer.

12:45.125 --> 12:48.165
What would you like?
A signature? A bespoke composition?

12:48.166 --> 12:52.165
A personalized ballad for your lover?
Lovers? Lover's lover?

12:52.166 --> 12:55.415
[man] I'm in charge
of tomorrow's Imbaelk festival.

12:55.416 --> 12:58.415
Getting a fancy bard like yourself
would do wonders.

12:58.416 --> 13:03.332
The king will be there,
so we need to put on a good show.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.415
And I pay well.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.624
[bell tolls]

13:07.625 --> 13:09.957
[mysterious music playing]

13:09.958 --> 13:13.540
Now, can I trust you
to be sensible during my performance?

13:13.541 --> 13:17.999
The last time I left you alone
at a banquet, you ended up with a child.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.165
A Child Surprise, and it's a mistake
I won't soon make again.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.083
Ah.

13:24.250 --> 13:28.374
I'll be a tough act to follow.
Good thing this lot is going first.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.791
[man] Mm-hmm.

13:31.416 --> 13:34.415
[crowd gasping]

13:34.416 --> 13:36.457
[Jaskier] Well, wait. If you like that,

13:36.458 --> 13:39.875
wait till you see my solo
on the psaltery. [chuckles]

13:40.458 --> 13:42.166
[folk music playing]

13:43.291 --> 13:45.832
The psaltery is like a harp,
but it's, like, really small.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.082
It's much more practical if you ask me.

13:48.083 --> 13:51.415
Shut your trap!
I'm trying to watch the show!

13:51.416 --> 13:54.582
Uh, that is no way
to speak to your headliner.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.290
Headliner? [scoffs]

13:56.291 --> 13:59.040
- That's rich.
- Does that mean what I think it means?

13:59.041 --> 14:01.958
Because I'm afraid
I can only accept top billing.

14:02.458 --> 14:03.499
A deal's a deal.

14:03.500 --> 14:07.415
I know what our deal was,
Geralt, but it's not good for my brand.

14:07.416 --> 14:10.082
Come, now. Have a little humility.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.124
[folk music continues]

14:12.125 --> 14:14.833
I practically begged Drouhard
to give you the gig.

14:15.958 --> 14:16.915
Little Eye!

14:16.916 --> 14:19.040
[Little Eye] It's good to see you, Julian.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.125
Julian?

14:20.958 --> 14:22.957
Oh, excuse my slack-jawed companion.

14:22.958 --> 14:25.790
Essi Daven, meet Geralt of Rivia.

14:25.791 --> 14:27.875
[folk music continues]

14:30.833 --> 14:32.540
You two know one another?

14:32.541 --> 14:34.915
We grew up together.
Right here in Bremervoord.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.790
You said you were from Oxenfurt.

14:36.791 --> 14:40.082
[laughs] Don't let
the fancy trousers fool you.

14:40.083 --> 14:43.082
This one's a backwater bumpkin,
just like the rest of us.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.958
So I took some poetic license
with my personal history. Big deal.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.458
Who could blame me?

14:50.250 --> 14:51.875
Growing up in a place like this.

14:53.625 --> 14:54.458
[boy 1] Jump!

14:55.000 --> 14:57.041
- Oy, come on! Jump!
- [boy 2] Come on, hurry up!

14:57.625 --> 14:59.040
Or are you too scared?

14:59.041 --> 15:03.291
Like I said. If you jump,
I'll give you back your toy.

15:03.875 --> 15:07.665
- [boy 2] He's gonna pee himself.
- [boy 1] He's never gonna jump.

15:07.666 --> 15:09.750
- [boy 2] Pankratz!
- [Jaskier whimpers]

15:10.375 --> 15:11.999
Let me go first, Pankratz.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.708
I'll show you how it's done.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.458
- [boy laughs]
- [Jaskier gasps]

15:18.958 --> 15:20.666
- [boy 3 grunts]
- [Jaskier gasps]

15:21.250 --> 15:24.707
[Jaskier yells]

15:24.708 --> 15:26.124
[boy 2] Whoa, did you hear that?

15:26.125 --> 15:28.416
- Ooh!
- [laughter]

15:30.291 --> 15:33.250
- [Jaskier strains]
- [boy 2] He didn't jump. He fell!

15:33.791 --> 15:35.124
Get him, Zelest.

15:35.125 --> 15:38.249
[Essi] Stop! He can't breathe! Let him up!

15:38.250 --> 15:41.458
Come on, Essi. You're his mom now, huh?

15:42.458 --> 15:44.166
- [Jaskier groans]
- [instrument strums]

15:46.583 --> 15:50.665
- Someone should do that to you, Zelest.
- We're just having some fun!

15:50.666 --> 15:53.415
- [Essi] Are you all right?
- [boy 4] It's just a game.

15:53.416 --> 15:55.165
[ominous music playing]

15:55.166 --> 15:58.915
I'd call you a bastard, but everyone here
already knows you're one.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.500
[ominous music continues]

16:02.375 --> 16:03.207
[Essi grunts]

16:03.208 --> 16:07.082
[boys laugh]

16:07.083 --> 16:10.499
- Came out of nowhere. [laughs]
- [girl] She showed him!

16:10.500 --> 16:12.540
- [exhales]
- [boy 1] Did you see that?

16:12.541 --> 16:14.625
[laughter continues]

16:18.000 --> 16:20.333
[Geralt] Huh. What happened
to the little shit?

16:20.833 --> 16:21.749
What, Zelest?

16:21.750 --> 16:25.041
He was the king's bastard kid
and a real prick to boot.

16:25.541 --> 16:28.457
He probably died of syphilis
in a debtor's prison.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.749
Half-blind, crazed, and salivating.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.290
I've not spent
much time thinking about it.

16:33.291 --> 16:37.500
- [fanfare playing]
- Ooh.

16:38.125 --> 16:41.666
King Usveldt. Prince Agloval.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.583
- [man 1] The king!
- [man 2] The king!

16:46.791 --> 16:49.707
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.124
[herald] And Commander Zelest.

16:52.125 --> 16:55.124
Always was a real
sucker-upper-kicker-downer, wasn't he?

16:55.125 --> 16:58.832
Prince Agloval appointed him
as military advisor.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.791
[crowd murmurs]

17:01.541 --> 17:04.458
- [man 3] The nerve of the man.
- [man 4] This is bad.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.665
- Risky talk for royal subjects.
- They've had enough.

17:09.666 --> 17:11.707
Five attacks on divers
in the last few months,

17:11.708 --> 17:13.082
and no one's held to account.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.999
Except the Allamorax.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.832
Most folks know
that poor creature was just a scapegoat.

17:17.833 --> 17:22.040
The merpeople are notoriously territorial,
and our royals won't retaliate

17:22.041 --> 17:24.415
because Prince Agloval's in love
with a mermaid.

17:24.416 --> 17:26.499
[Jaskier] Wow. That is messy.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.666
[Geralt] This is the same
as every feud since the Conjunction.

17:30.916 --> 17:32.875
[jaunty folk music playing]

17:40.583 --> 17:44.374
Tradition awaits! If you don't join,
Mom will find some way to blame me.

17:44.375 --> 17:48.415
- You don't want my death upon your hands.
- Oh. Um, my nephew.

17:48.416 --> 17:50.041
Would you excuse me?

17:52.041 --> 17:52.958
[woman laughs]

17:53.583 --> 17:55.333
[folk music continues]

17:57.250 --> 18:00.708
[nephew and Essie laugh]

18:02.958 --> 18:04.000
[folk music fades]

18:05.208 --> 18:07.208
[waves lap]

18:09.875 --> 18:11.875
[somber music playing]

18:20.166 --> 18:24.040
[man laughs] Look at this haul.

18:24.041 --> 18:27.124
We'll be rolling in coin in no time.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.582
And by coin, you mean food.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.790
Every kid in my village is starving.

18:31.791 --> 18:36.124
People in your parts should stop
breeding like bunnies. [laughs]

18:36.125 --> 18:39.750
Now, less lip flapping,
more shell cracking.

18:40.916 --> 18:43.250
[somber music playing]

18:52.083 --> 18:53.666
Ah! I found one!

18:56.208 --> 18:57.208
Gimme that.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.915
What we do with the rest?

19:00.916 --> 19:02.999
Toss that worthless shit back in--

19:03.000 --> 19:05.083
[ominous music playing]

19:08.875 --> 19:09.875
[music fades]

19:12.458 --> 19:13.540
Who's there?

19:13.541 --> 19:14.791
Show yourself!

19:15.416 --> 19:17.041
[rumbling]

19:17.791 --> 19:19.541
[creaking]

19:22.208 --> 19:24.166
[creaking continues]

19:33.333 --> 19:34.750
[sailor yells]

19:42.250 --> 19:44.374
I thought you wanted
to be with your family.

19:44.375 --> 19:47.707
I love 'em dearly,
but we all need a breather sometimes.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.665
- Clearly, you can relate.
- Clearly.

19:50.666 --> 19:53.415
Anyway, I wanted to spend time
with the mysterious man

19:53.416 --> 19:55.790
who inspired so many of Jaskier's ballads.

19:55.791 --> 19:57.290
More like bollocks.

19:57.291 --> 20:00.165
I'm sure you know
Jaskier is prone to dramatics.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.957
Come, now. Are you being modest?

20:01.958 --> 20:05.582
What of the song where you wrestled
a werewolf, barefisted in Moulderwood

20:05.583 --> 20:06.999
under the glowing full moon?

20:07.000 --> 20:10.249
I cured that werewolf
with enchanted wolfsbane.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.457
And the one where
you defeated a horde of vampires

20:12.458 --> 20:14.874
with three stakes
in each hand and one in the mouth?

20:14.875 --> 20:16.957
One vampire. One stake.

20:16.958 --> 20:18.874
And the one where you found a djinn,

20:18.875 --> 20:23.041
saved the life of a beautiful witch
and became bound to her through magic?

20:27.750 --> 20:31.249
I'm simply saying,
most would lean into the embellishments.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.040
Delight in the grand persona.

20:33.041 --> 20:36.666
Like Jaskier, or should I say, Julian?

20:37.375 --> 20:39.000
I understand why he left.

20:39.583 --> 20:40.665
Outside the palace,

20:40.666 --> 20:43.957
men in Bremervoord are expected
to take up a trade on the seas.

20:43.958 --> 20:45.875
But Julian was always creative.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.374
Different.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.374
And treated horribly for it.

20:49.375 --> 20:53.916
By everyone except you.
It takes bravery to stand against a crowd.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.665
You never thought
to set your sights beyond Bremervoord?

20:58.666 --> 21:01.790
Things were different for me.
I was never unhappy.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.832
Though I sometimes wonder
what life would be like if I left.

21:04.833 --> 21:08.333
But I love the sea,
my family, and friends.

21:08.958 --> 21:11.333
What more could this Continent offer me?

21:13.541 --> 21:16.790
So, why do they call you Little Eye

21:16.791 --> 21:19.041
when you have two huge eyes?

21:21.791 --> 21:22.874
[firework whistles]

21:22.875 --> 21:27.041
[fireworks explode]

21:28.416 --> 21:30.416
N-Not huge. I mean...

21:31.250 --> 21:35.291
Normal-sized. Perfectly ordinary
and unremarkable human eyes.

21:36.541 --> 21:39.874
Flirting is not your strong suit,
is it, Witcher?

21:39.875 --> 21:42.957
[applause, cheering]

21:42.958 --> 21:45.499
My set was unparalleled.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.915
Even these uncultured yokels
gave me a standing ovation.

21:48.916 --> 21:52.041
Ha. I pity the local hack
who has to follow me.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.458
Wish me luck.

21:55.958 --> 21:59.957
Y-You... You're the local bard
everyone's been raving about?

21:59.958 --> 22:01.165
[laughs]

22:01.166 --> 22:03.124
Well, that's wonderful, Essi!

22:03.125 --> 22:07.750
Oh, I'm... I am sure
that you will do splendidly. [chuckles]

22:08.333 --> 22:09.791
Good luck. All right! [chuckles]

22:10.750 --> 22:13.165
People used to mistake
her singing for mating cats,

22:13.166 --> 22:15.333
so whatever happens, just smile and clap.

Pearl prices being what they are,

23:31.208 --> 23:34.749
we should send
every last one of those meddling merpeople

23:34.750 --> 23:36.874
to their briny graves.

23:36.875 --> 23:41.165
My hands are tied as long as the prince
is chasing that shimmery tail.

23:41.166 --> 23:45.540
The mermaid's no doubt bewitched him.
They're known to be magical tricksters.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.750
[Geralt] No more deceitful than humans.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.999
I don't recall
asking for your opinion, Witcher.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.500
That's right. I know who you are.

23:55.458 --> 23:57.291
White Wolf.

23:58.125 --> 23:59.957
If you know my name,

23:59.958 --> 24:02.416
it's because you know his songs.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.666
- [fanfare playing]

24:08.416 --> 24:11.707
- [fanfare continues]

[woman] She's beautiful!
It's the princess!

24:14.500 --> 24:17.665
Holy hirikkas. Who is she?

24:17.666 --> 24:19.749
Princess Nispen of Maribor.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.749
A late invitation,
but a wise one by the king.

24:22.750 --> 24:27.040
A good reminder there are
plenty of human princesses to marry.

24:27.041 --> 24:30.957
She even brought delicacies
from home, and fruit!

24:30.958 --> 24:33.124
My kind of princess.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.916
[Zelest] Let's hope Agloval's too.

[Nispen gasps]

24:53.875 --> 24:55.124
What happened?

24:55.125 --> 24:57.207
- Fetch a barber!
- [Zelest] Clear a path.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.665
Who did this?

24:58.666 --> 25:01.957
I was speared by those fish fucks.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.041
The vodnik.

25:04.541 --> 25:05.416
They got me.

25:05.916 --> 25:06.750
For good.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.916
[wheezes]

25:10.916 --> 25:15.207
If it were Kovir, Cintra,
a human navy attacking us,

25:15.208 --> 25:17.041
we'd be at war by now.

25:17.541 --> 25:19.665
Are we a kingdom, or are we cowards?

25:19.666 --> 25:21.415
[ominous music playing]

25:21.416 --> 25:24.166
Sorry, son, but the time has come.

25:24.875 --> 25:26.375
We've run out of options.

25:27.041 --> 25:28.249
[Zelest] Sire, if I may.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.833
Not all options.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.832
We have a monster problem off our shore,

25:32.833 --> 25:35.457
and a monster hunter in our midst.

25:35.458 --> 25:38.375
Witcher, your services are required.

25:38.916 --> 25:41.665
Find the vodnik who did this and kill it.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.665
[scoffs] Good luck. Ask anyone in town.

25:44.666 --> 25:47.457
He already failed
at killing the Allamorax.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.207
Because it was not the beast
you were looking for.

25:50.208 --> 25:54.040
But clearly the vodnik are.
They work for the merpeople.

25:54.041 --> 25:57.124
If the Witcher confirms
that they're the ones attacking divers,

25:57.125 --> 25:59.749
you'll have no choice but to declare war.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.624
- [man 1] Find them all!
- [man 2] Kill them!

26:01.625 --> 26:03.624
[man 1] Kill the slimy bastards!

26:03.625 --> 26:07.374
[crowd shouting]

26:07.375 --> 26:08.499
A deal's a deal.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.457
This isn't what we agreed to.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.333
Well, neither was second billing.

26:12.958 --> 26:14.874
We all must make sacrifices.

26:14.875 --> 26:20.541
- [Geralt] I'm not helping justify a war.
- But maybe you can help prevent one.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.125
What say you, Witcher?

26:27.125 --> 26:28.166
Fuck.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.165
Why didn't you tell me
you're from Bremervoord?

26:38.166 --> 26:41.082
You know I'm not actually from Rivia.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.833
Well, it's not just that. It...

26:44.000 --> 26:45.790
I had to leave
this place completely behind

26:45.791 --> 26:47.915
so I could become who I wanted to be.

26:47.916 --> 26:51.415
In case you didn't notice, this town
is filled with small-minded fools.

26:51.416 --> 26:54.208
Your friend Essi
doesn't fit that description.

26:55.541 --> 26:56.375
Yeah.

26:57.291 --> 26:58.916
Yeah, she's like a sister to me.

27:01.791 --> 27:06.790
Aha! I knew it! I knew it. I could sense
there was something between you two.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.665
If by "something" you mean air and space.

27:09.666 --> 27:11.457
[Jaskier] She is a good woman.

27:11.458 --> 27:15.540
Unlike that raven-haired,
sunken-eyed, serpent-tongued she-demon.

27:15.541 --> 27:17.415
You need someone like Essi.

27:17.416 --> 27:20.290
I need coin, peace, and quiet.

27:20.291 --> 27:22.499
Look, you may appear to be as tough

27:22.500 --> 27:26.875
as this dreadfully overcooked meat
you've prepared, but I know the truth.

27:27.583 --> 27:30.415
That underneath the armor and the weapons

27:30.416 --> 27:33.582
and the hair,
the ridiculous, ridiculous hair,

27:33.583 --> 27:35.124
you are nothing but a softie.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.457
A softie, soft,
softie, soft, soft, softie, soft--

27:38.458 --> 27:40.541
- Ow.
- How's that for soft?

27:41.083 --> 27:45.249
I suggest you get a good night's sleep.
We have a long journey ahead of us.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.624
And I suggest you open your heart.

27:47.625 --> 27:51.165
Connecting with another human
isn't as awful as you make it seem.

27:51.166 --> 27:53.250
[pensive music playing]

28:06.833 --> 28:08.374
[water splashes]

28:08.375 --> 28:10.458
[pensive music continues]

28:17.166 --> 28:19.582
- Uh, I... I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

28:19.583 --> 28:21.374
Do something about it.

28:21.375 --> 28:24.082
- I couldn't tell if you felt the same way.
- [Geralt] I do.

28:24.083 --> 28:27.790
It's just... It's all a little too simple.

28:27.791 --> 28:31.749
- The best things in life often are.
- [Geralt] That hasn't been my experience.

28:31.750 --> 28:36.165
[Essi] It's as if you delight in tragedy.
In selecting the most difficult path.

28:36.166 --> 28:39.625
But you could choose serenity.
You could choose me.

28:40.583 --> 28:43.957
[Essi and Yennefer] You really should be
more inventive with your fantasies.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.750
It's downright cliché.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.958
Even in your dreams,
you can't keep up with me. [chuckles]

28:56.041 --> 28:58.250
[Geralt] It doesn't have to be this way.

28:58.833 --> 29:00.625
We could start again. Fresh.

29:01.125 --> 29:04.165
You sound like
your singsongy lady friend,

29:04.166 --> 29:06.290
and that is not a compliment.

29:06.291 --> 29:09.540
Why do you push me away
when I try to come closer?

29:09.541 --> 29:12.082
[scoffs] Please, Geralt. Wake up.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.583
- Yen, I--
- Wake up!

29:22.750 --> 29:25.125
[tense music playing]

29:26.666 --> 29:28.416
[metal scrapes]

29:35.375 --> 29:37.457
[grunting]

29:37.458 --> 29:39.000
[tense music continues]

29:51.416 --> 29:53.875
- [tense music builds]
- [spits]

29:55.666 --> 29:56.583
[Geralt groans]

30:01.250 --> 30:02.250
[grunts]

30:06.166 --> 30:08.166
[tense music continues]

30:22.708 --> 30:24.791
[Geralt yells]

30:27.458 --> 30:28.375
[gasps]

30:30.625 --> 30:32.625
[Geralt strains]

30:38.208 --> 30:39.083
[sighs]

30:42.958 --> 30:45.750
[yawns]

30:47.375 --> 30:48.333
What did I miss?

30:53.125 --> 30:55.707
I know you don't like
killing creatures for no reason,

30:55.708 --> 30:57.624
but that one almost killed you,

30:57.625 --> 30:59.249
and you still let it go.

30:59.250 --> 31:02.749
I let it go because it's more help to me
alive than dead.

31:02.750 --> 31:06.250
It's a vodnik.
Like the one that killed the pearl diver.

31:06.833 --> 31:10.124
And vodnik blood's iridescent.

31:10.125 --> 31:13.207
If I can track it to the den,
we'll find the others.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.624
I'm so sorry. The others?

31:14.625 --> 31:18.707
That vodnik can fight, but it couldn't
take out a whole boatload alone.

31:18.708 --> 31:23.040
They travel in schools, but how
did a sea creature know where to find us?

31:23.041 --> 31:27.165
Now that you're with a famous bard,
everyone knows our whereabouts! [chuckles]

31:27.166 --> 31:29.082
Fans can be really obsessive.

31:29.083 --> 31:32.790
Or the Allamorax and merpeople I spared
put the word out.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.915
[Jaskier] Nah, it's me.
It's definitely me.

31:34.916 --> 31:36.125
[twig cracks]

31:38.833 --> 31:39.833
[Jaskier gasps]

31:41.750 --> 31:42.832
[Geralt] Essi?

31:42.833 --> 31:44.582
Why are you following us?

31:44.583 --> 31:47.374
You heard the king.
We're on the verge of war!

31:47.375 --> 31:50.165
I need to know what's happening
in my town. I want to help.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.207
I appreciate your willingness.

31:52.208 --> 31:55.791
What I need right now
is a boat to follow that vodnik.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.874
No, you don't.
The tide shifts over ten cubits,

31:58.875 --> 32:00.625
and we're almost at low ebb.

32:02.875 --> 32:03.708
Look.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.875
[mysterious music playing]

32:11.791 --> 32:14.500
At low tide,
you can walk to Dragons Fangs.

32:20.958 --> 32:24.708
I remember being your age.
Being fascinated with all types.

32:25.541 --> 32:28.374
Mistaking infatuation with romance.

32:28.375 --> 32:31.208
Until... I found your mother.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.749
She was radiant.

32:33.750 --> 32:34.874
Gracious.

32:34.875 --> 32:38.333
She had a knack
for seeing only the best in people.

32:38.916 --> 32:42.749
Gods know that must be
why she said yes to me.

32:42.750 --> 32:43.750
I miss her too.

32:44.625 --> 32:48.291
And I shall honor her memory
by marrying for love, as you did.

32:49.375 --> 32:50.666
I want to marry Sh'eenaz.

32:51.791 --> 32:54.207
I know how you claim
to feel about the mergirl, son,

32:54.208 --> 32:58.040
but for those at our station,
marriage isn't only about love.

32:58.041 --> 32:59.750
It's about duty.

33:00.250 --> 33:03.124
Your life doesn't just belong to you.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.082
It belongs to your kingdom.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.999
I'm thinking about the kingdom.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.582
Our union has the potential
to bring peace to land and sea.

33:10.583 --> 33:12.915
How so, Agloval? Where would you live?

33:12.916 --> 33:16.958
What offspring could you produce?
It's impossible.

33:20.208 --> 33:21.582
[Zelest clears throat]

33:21.583 --> 33:25.875
- Apologies for the interruption.
- No bother. I was just leaving.

33:28.041 --> 33:31.874
For what it's worth, I've tried
to tell him to end it with that fish girl.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.915
I appreciate that. He values your advice.

33:34.916 --> 33:37.832
Whatever you need.
I'm here to serve the kingdom.

33:37.833 --> 33:39.791
And you, Father.

33:40.375 --> 33:41.749
Thank you, Zelest.

33:41.750 --> 33:45.499
Some days, I wish
you were my full-blooded son.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.458
I'd love to see
the type of leader you'd be.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.750
[waves crashing]

33:57.666 --> 33:59.125
- [kissing]
- [Sh'eenaz sighs softly]

33:59.750 --> 34:00.874
[Agloval chuckles softly]

34:00.875 --> 34:02.375
[gentle music playing]

34:03.166 --> 34:04.083
[Agloval sighs]

34:04.708 --> 34:07.249
Everything looks so peaceful from afar.

34:07.250 --> 34:09.541
Who'd ever know
the turmoil that brews below?

34:10.041 --> 34:13.749
[in Merspeak] I wish my parents,
all of my people,

34:13.750 --> 34:17.332
could see that you are just like us.

34:17.333 --> 34:21.165
Even if your language
is horrendously ear-piercing.

34:21.166 --> 34:24.374
[in English] Hmm.
Across the heavens, land, and sea,

34:24.375 --> 34:26.832
I've never seen
a creature more beautiful than you.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.250
This is love.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.624
[in Merspeak] This is love.

34:30.625 --> 34:33.082
Finally together.

34:33.083 --> 34:37.208
Wishing I could spend the rest of my days
right here by your side.

34:38.041 --> 34:40.041
[gentle music continues]

34:42.750 --> 34:44.750
[intriguing music playing]

34:46.791 --> 34:49.749
Where is the Witcher taking those humans?

34:49.750 --> 34:51.249
[in English] My love, what is it?

34:51.250 --> 34:54.208
[in Merspeak] I have to warn the others.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.750
[water splashes]

34:58.375 --> 35:00.750
[gentle music playing]

35:07.458 --> 35:08.416
[whimpers softly]

35:11.583 --> 35:15.249
[in English] Dragons Fangs.
They gave me nightmares when I was young.

35:15.250 --> 35:18.624
They're just a couple of rocks, Julian.
Nothing to be scared of.

35:18.625 --> 35:21.082
Except for that vodnik den.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.166
[foreboding music playing]

35:24.083 --> 35:25.374
[vodnik gasps]

35:25.375 --> 35:27.083
What'd you... [whimpers]

35:27.791 --> 35:29.250
[tense music playing]

35:32.958 --> 35:35.249
[panting]

35:35.250 --> 35:36.333
[Geralt grunts]

35:38.708 --> 35:40.457
Who sent you after me?

35:40.458 --> 35:44.040
[strains] If I told you, she'd kill me.

35:44.041 --> 35:46.624
And if you don't, I will.

35:46.625 --> 35:49.290
Is she the one
who ordered you to kill the pearl divers?

35:49.291 --> 35:51.540
I've never killed any divers,

35:51.541 --> 35:53.165
but I'm glad someone did.

35:53.166 --> 35:56.040
You think you're protecting your betters.
You're not.

35:56.041 --> 36:00.874
Because whoever she is, she's willing
to let you die for her fights.

36:00.875 --> 36:03.582
People think I've gone soft
on killing monsters.

36:03.583 --> 36:07.499
I'll prove them wrong
unless you give me a name.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.582
It was--

36:08.583 --> 36:11.708
[vodnik groans]

36:15.625 --> 36:17.207
[vodnik groans]

36:17.208 --> 36:18.500
[Geralt growls]

36:21.791 --> 36:22.875
What did you do?

36:23.458 --> 36:24.957
Your job, Witcher!

36:24.958 --> 36:28.832
You're as bad at saying thank you
as you are at killing monsters.

36:28.833 --> 36:31.665
I see you're still getting others
to fight your battles, Julian.

36:31.666 --> 36:36.332
I'm trying to stop a war.
Why is it you seem to be pushing for one?

36:36.333 --> 36:40.208
Nonsense! I simply
understand what it means to lead.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.416
- [tense music playing]
- [vodnik growls]

36:45.250 --> 36:48.125
- [soldier groans]
- [running footsteps approach]

36:51.708 --> 36:53.708
[tense music continues]

36:54.750 --> 36:55.666
[groans]

37:03.125 --> 37:04.041
[Zelest grunts]

37:06.125 --> 37:06.999
[Zelest grunts]

37:07.000 --> 37:09.083
[tense music continues]

37:11.208 --> 37:12.416
[soldier groans]

37:19.208 --> 37:22.000
[merman groans]

37:25.791 --> 37:26.916
[merman groans]

37:28.083 --> 37:29.583
[tense music continues]

37:31.666 --> 37:33.166
[vodnik groans]

37:34.916 --> 37:35.958
[soldier groans]

37:36.708 --> 37:37.708
[soldier groans]

37:39.125 --> 37:40.625
- [Essi] Julian!
- [Jaskier groans]

37:41.208 --> 37:42.290
[Jaskier groans]

37:42.291 --> 37:43.790
[vodnik snarls]

37:43.791 --> 37:44.958
[Essi groans]

37:45.541 --> 37:46.540
Essi!

37:46.541 --> 37:48.625
[tense music playing]

37:50.541 --> 37:52.541
[Essie strains]

37:53.291 --> 37:55.499
[vodnik snarls]

37:55.500 --> 37:57.207
[Essi strains]

37:57.208 --> 37:58.750
[Essi yells]

38:00.291 --> 38:01.875
[vodnik groans]

38:03.250 --> 38:04.916
[suspenseful whooshing]

38:09.875 --> 38:11.875
[somber music playing]

38:16.625 --> 38:18.040
[coughs]

38:18.041 --> 38:20.125
[somber music continues]

38:23.125 --> 38:25.458
- [Geralt grunts]
- [Essi gasps]

38:26.291 --> 38:28.000
- [swords clash]
- [fighters clamor]

38:38.375 --> 38:42.082
Leave, or I'll kill
the only real monster I see.

38:42.083 --> 38:43.832
[somber music continues]

38:43.833 --> 38:45.916
[clamoring continues]

38:52.000 --> 38:53.915
[ship creaks]

38:53.916 --> 38:56.375
[somber music continues]

38:57.291 --> 39:00.333
[grunts] My father will hear about this!

39:02.791 --> 39:04.125
[waves lap]

39:05.708 --> 39:07.500
The water's rising too fast!

39:08.083 --> 39:12.249
Essi, if you know the ocean,
now's the time to prove it.

39:12.250 --> 39:13.375
Follow me.

39:15.291 --> 39:16.499
Jump!

39:16.500 --> 39:18.415
This seems like an awful--

39:18.416 --> 39:20.375
- [Jaskier yells]
- [water splashes]

39:27.291 --> 39:28.166
[coughs]

39:29.375 --> 39:32.125
- [labored breathing]
- [Dahut] What has happened?

39:32.708 --> 39:35.457
[mermaid] It was
the prince's bastard brother!

39:35.458 --> 39:39.749
He must be acting on his own.
Agloval would never allow such a thing.

39:39.750 --> 39:43.290
Or he's simply slick enough
to hide his plans from you.

39:43.291 --> 39:47.291
That human has distracted you
from your duty to protect the seas.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.249
I warned you when I saw the Witcher.

39:50.250 --> 39:53.333
Presently, your hysterics
are the only thing distracting me.

39:53.875 --> 39:56.000
I am a healer, not a fighter.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.540
So let me help our cousin.

39:58.541 --> 40:00.500
In the eyes of our kind,

40:01.125 --> 40:02.624
war has already begun.

40:02.625 --> 40:05.166
Hold on, Deroua. Deep breaths.

40:05.958 --> 40:07.583
[somber music playing]

40:08.458 --> 40:09.582
[labored breathing]

40:09.583 --> 40:10.708
[gasps]

40:11.916 --> 40:14.083
[mermaid sobbing]

40:25.750 --> 40:26.791
[music fades]

40:33.833 --> 40:35.874
Thanks for your help today, Essi.

40:35.875 --> 40:37.583
[Jaskier] And what of my help?

40:38.208 --> 40:39.291
Got any more ale?

40:39.958 --> 40:42.540
Everyone keeps blaming
the prince and the mermaid girl.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.874
Those are the two we need to speak to.
Get the truth straight from the source.

40:45.875 --> 40:49.124
They meet at dawn on Founder's Rock
each day. I see 'em from my window.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.207
We can go in the morning.

40:50.208 --> 40:53.082
I worry the humans
aren't looking for truth.

40:53.083 --> 40:56.290
They're simply looking for a reason
to exterminate the sea creatures.

40:56.291 --> 40:58.874
We survive off sea life. Why kill 'em off?

40:58.875 --> 41:02.040
Humans have a knack
for seeking short-term profits

41:02.041 --> 41:04.957
and retelling the story
so it wasn't their fault.

41:04.958 --> 41:10.082
I've seen it happen with sylvan horns,
basilisk scales, and now pearls.

41:10.083 --> 41:13.290
It's no longer about sustenance.
It's about greed.

41:13.291 --> 41:16.082
The vodnik said it was hired by a "she."

41:16.083 --> 41:17.500
Is this the queen's doing?

41:18.250 --> 41:21.957
You seem certain about the mermaid queen,
but what's the motive?

41:21.958 --> 41:24.749
A parent would do anything
to protect her child.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.916
She believes Prince Agloval
to be a threat.

41:29.500 --> 41:33.458
The way we've treated mermaids
in the past, can't say I blame her.

41:34.833 --> 41:39.707
What passed for love in my childhood
was a cold patch of hay on a dirt floor

41:39.708 --> 41:42.624
and enough meager rations
to survive another day.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.583
Your kind has never inspired
that much trust.

41:48.166 --> 41:50.500
[Essi] Sounds like
you're trapped in your past.

41:54.333 --> 41:56.833
Perhaps when solving life's big mysteries,

41:58.166 --> 42:00.125
start by looking right in front of you.

42:00.791 --> 42:01.625
[Jaskier] Hmm.

42:05.625 --> 42:06.541
[sighs]

42:12.375 --> 42:15.832
Jaskier, tell me more of the time
you sang for the Countess de Stael.

42:15.833 --> 42:18.874
I've already told you
that story three times.

42:18.875 --> 42:22.999
I don't mean to be a pest. Your tales
give me a vicarious thrill, but I'll stop.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.665
Thank gods. Agloval and the princess
better turn up soon.

42:26.666 --> 42:30.332
I cannot deny
a dear friend's humble request.

42:30.333 --> 42:34.957
It was a warm summer night in Maribor
when I was reunited with my countess.

42:34.958 --> 42:39.249
Alas, there'd been
a blight for two-times-ten years!

42:39.250 --> 42:41.415
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years!

42:41.416 --> 42:45.707
So instead of making love
under the stars in her peach orchard

42:45.708 --> 42:49.457
as the fragrant floral scent
wafted from the trees,

42:49.458 --> 42:54.124
it was the smell of acrid fungi
underneath shriveled branches

42:54.125 --> 42:56.415
that filled our nostrils and our--

42:56.416 --> 42:58.582
[Geralt] We don't wanna know
what it filled.

42:58.583 --> 43:03.207
Fair enough, but alas, nothing could stop
our sweet, sweet passion.

43:03.208 --> 43:07.874
Not even a fiefdom's economic free fall
as the fruit capital of the Continent.

43:07.875 --> 43:10.707
- And they've never recovered since.
- Is that true, Jaskier?

43:10.708 --> 43:14.666
Uh, you of all people
doubt my love for the Countess de Stael?

43:15.208 --> 43:18.166
- [Essie] There they are.
- [gentle music playing]

43:24.375 --> 43:28.165
[in Merspeak] Did your kind
send a vodnik to kill me last night?

43:28.166 --> 43:31.665
[in English] I would have started
with a "good morning" first. Oof.

43:31.666 --> 43:34.957
[in Merspeak] Please excuse him.
He may have the manners of a boar,

43:34.958 --> 43:36.749
but he has the heart of a lion.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.582
Or sea lion, in your case.

43:38.583 --> 43:43.040
You speak beautifully. I'm impressed.

43:43.041 --> 43:47.874
Your lover talks like a cawing crow.
You may want to give him a lesson.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.458
Lover? I barely know her.

43:51.166 --> 43:53.374
[in English] Lady bard... Uh, Essi.

43:53.375 --> 43:54.583
Come translate for me.

43:55.583 --> 43:58.165
Tell Sh'eenaz that I would
like us to be married,

43:58.166 --> 44:01.165
though it may take some time
to convince my father. [chuckles]

44:01.166 --> 44:06.207
[in Merspeak] He wants to marry you.
Now he must convince his father.

44:06.208 --> 44:11.874
I have a tail, and you have legs.
How can we turn this fantasy into reality?

44:11.875 --> 44:15.499
[in English] She asks
how to turn this fantasy into reality.

44:15.500 --> 44:19.832
- She has a tail, and you have legs.
- That is nothing in the face of love.

44:19.833 --> 44:23.000
But love means being together.

44:23.583 --> 44:26.707
And she cannot live
among the hideous dirt-walkers.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.790
[Jaskier chuckles]

44:28.791 --> 44:30.457
[Essi] Her words. Not mine.

44:30.458 --> 44:32.458
Perhaps I can build her a tank.

44:32.958 --> 44:37.207
She's a princess, not a pet. To suggest
such a thing is beyond offensive.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.582
I'm trying to think of solutions.

44:38.583 --> 44:42.499
And all your solutions require
loss on her part and nothing from you.

44:42.500 --> 44:44.624
Not even a little sacrifice.

44:44.625 --> 44:45.541
Her words,

44:46.208 --> 44:47.082
or yours?

44:47.083 --> 44:49.915
We can get back
to this lover's spat later.

44:49.916 --> 44:52.499
Right now, I need to stop a war.

44:52.500 --> 44:54.083
Ask her about the vodnik.

44:54.750 --> 44:59.165
[in Merspeak] The Witcher asked you again
about yesterday's attack.

44:59.166 --> 45:01.540
You can tell your Witcher
I heard him the first time.

45:01.541 --> 45:04.582
I know nothing of a vodnik attack,

45:04.583 --> 45:06.666
except by the king's men.

45:07.583 --> 45:10.790
- [in English] You say you were attacked.
- Shortly after your father hired me.

45:10.791 --> 45:15.040
As if someone didn't want me
to discover who killed those pearl divers.

45:15.041 --> 45:17.291
We saw you
near Dragons Fangs that morning.

45:18.083 --> 45:19.708
I could tell Sh'eenaz was angry.

45:20.291 --> 45:23.791
You swam off
without so much as a goodbye kiss. Why?

45:26.250 --> 45:29.999
[in Merspeak] Were you angry
when you left him yesterday?

45:30.000 --> 45:35.874
Of course I was angry. I went to save
my people from your brother's blade!

45:35.875 --> 45:37.790
[in English] I am sure Zelest and his men

45:37.791 --> 45:40.540
fought admirably to help find
the culprits who killed the pearl diver.

45:40.541 --> 45:43.124
[in Merspeak] Perhaps my parents
were right about you humans,

45:43.125 --> 45:47.040
if you would defend
the murderer who killed my cousin!

45:47.041 --> 45:49.749
[in English] Perhaps Zelest was right
about you bewitching me.

45:49.750 --> 45:52.166
I cannot believe I fell for this! For you!

45:57.916 --> 46:01.332

54:30.541 --> 54:32.375
[Jaskier grunts]

54:32.958 --> 54:34.750
[eerie music playing]

54:46.833 --> 54:48.791
[groans] Useless pegs!

54:56.083 --> 55:00.415
Wow, Geralt. You really know
how to spot those raven-haired witches.

55:00.416 --> 55:03.582
- How'd you know she wasn't real?
- Because of something you said.

55:03.583 --> 55:06.707
Maribor had a blight
on their orchards for 20 years.

55:06.708 --> 55:08.790
Uh, two-times-ten years.

55:08.791 --> 55:13.457
So she's not from Maribor.
She magicked that fruit into existence!

55:13.458 --> 55:15.332
Ha! I solved the case!

55:15.333 --> 55:18.250
[Agloval] You were in league
with that sea witch all along!

55:18.750 --> 55:20.707
- Son.
- All these attacks.

55:20.708 --> 55:23.832
All the pearl divers
and fishermen who died.

55:23.833 --> 55:25.957
That was you and Melusina!

55:25.958 --> 55:29.415
One attack should have caused
the dominoes to fall,

55:29.416 --> 55:32.374
but you were so stubborn,
I had to keep going.

55:32.375 --> 55:35.707
If you hadn't insisted
on hiring this sewer cleaner,

55:35.708 --> 55:38.290
this problem would be gone by now.

55:38.291 --> 55:39.957
You killed our people!

55:39.958 --> 55:44.540
And I would do it again
to get you to come to your senses.

55:44.541 --> 55:48.499
Our family has sat on that throne
for 11 generations,

55:48.500 --> 55:53.374
and there will be 11 more generations
once you find the right princess.

55:53.375 --> 55:55.415
Mother would be disgusted with you.

55:55.416 --> 55:58.749
Don't you dare speak of your mother to me.

55:58.750 --> 56:02.249
I'm doing this for her, you fucking child!

56:02.250 --> 56:05.915
Her legacy will die
because of your stubborn arrogance.

56:05.916 --> 56:08.874
Those divers. What about their legacies?

56:08.875 --> 56:12.290
None of them would have had to die
if you weren't so selfish.

56:12.291 --> 56:15.874
You made me do this.
Their blood is on your hands, not mine.

56:15.875 --> 56:19.375
If this is how I'd have to rule,
I want no part of it.

56:22.125 --> 56:25.165
We'll just, uh, follow the prince out.

56:25.166 --> 56:26.540
Don't worry about us.

56:26.541 --> 56:27.791
We attack now!

56:28.333 --> 56:31.165
Round up the conscripts. Zelest!

56:31.166 --> 56:34.374
Dump their bodies out past Dragons Fangs.

56:34.375 --> 56:38.874
You love those sea monsters so much,
you can be with them forever.

56:38.875 --> 56:39.791
[Zelest] No.

56:40.708 --> 56:43.957
I pushed for war
because I thought we'd been attacked.

56:43.958 --> 56:46.082
Bought into the old prejudices.

56:46.083 --> 56:48.832
- But it was you.
- Watch yourself, son.

56:48.833 --> 56:50.332
Don't call me that!

56:50.333 --> 56:51.874
[laughs]

56:51.875 --> 56:54.332
A lifetime of not being enough,

56:54.333 --> 56:56.249
and now you want to claim me.

56:56.250 --> 57:01.000
No! I'm not going to add to the bloodshed
to prop up a deceitful king!

57:01.541 --> 57:06.332
I have to protect Agloval,
as much as he's disappointed me,

57:06.333 --> 57:10.416
but you've never been anything
but a mistake I wanted to erase.

57:10.916 --> 57:13.624
And now, I'll do just that.

57:13.625 --> 57:15.541
Dump his body too.

57:16.125 --> 57:17.291
[Zelest grunts]

[suspenseful music continues]

57:54.125 --> 57:54.999
[music fades]

57:55.000 --> 57:58.165
Your highness, no one
will give me a straight answer.

57:58.166 --> 57:59.707
What's going on at the docks?

57:59.708 --> 58:02.250
The royal fleet
is sailing to Dragons Fangs.

58:02.833 --> 58:04.416
I fear we're going to war.

58:04.958 --> 58:07.082
Where are Geralt and Jaskier?

58:07.083 --> 58:09.458
They confronted my father. He's...

58:11.500 --> 58:14.625
You won't see them again, Essi. I'm sorry.

58:15.791 --> 58:19.040
And you're going to let that happen?
Then you're no better than he is!

58:19.041 --> 58:20.999
Watch your tongue, bard!

58:21.000 --> 58:23.165
Remember to whom you are speaking.

58:23.166 --> 58:27.665
Oh, I know. I'm talking
to a man who lucked into a throne.

58:27.666 --> 58:31.749
Jaskier was right to leave this shithole
of a kingdom. I defended this place.

58:31.750 --> 58:34.082
Thought anything that went wrong
could be fixed,

58:34.083 --> 58:36.582
but that's not up to me or my family.

58:36.583 --> 58:39.707
We're just the poor people
outside the palace walls.

58:39.708 --> 58:40.958
It's up to yours.

58:43.750 --> 58:45.957
Too bad none of you
give a sod about the rest of us.

58:45.958 --> 58:48.540
- That's not true.
- Then prove it!

58:48.541 --> 58:52.665
You could stop this if you had a fraction
of the courage that Witcher does!

58:52.666 --> 58:55.082
He was trying to stop this war.

58:55.083 --> 58:56.500
Keep our people alive.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.749
It takes bravery to stand against a crowd.

58:59.750 --> 59:03.208
That Witcher's as honorable
as anyone in this kingdom.

59:04.333 --> 59:06.000
If that was Sh'eenaz out there,

59:06.666 --> 59:07.999
what would you do?

59:08.000 --> 59:10.083
[somber music playing]

59:16.750 --> 59:18.958
[Melusina groans]

[Melusina breathes heavily]

59:27.125 --> 59:29.125
[somber music continues]

59:32.041 --> 59:35.290
- Are you all right, Auntie?
- I'll be fine soon enough.

59:35.291 --> 59:37.790
Boats are above. They're coming for us!

59:37.791 --> 59:39.083
What's happening?

59:41.166 --> 59:43.832
Your parents' reign is over.

59:43.833 --> 59:45.541
[somber music continues]

59:59.625 --> 01:00:00.625
[music fades]

01:00:03.541 --> 01:00:04.832
This'll do.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:07.249
I should kill you first, Witcher,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.000
but I sense
you don't fear pain or even death.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:14.332
And yet, for all the talk
of Witchers lacking emotions,

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:16.250
I know how to hurt you.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.040
Make him watch his friends die.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:20.582
And make it quick.

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:22.500
I have a war to win.

01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:27.750
Two useless subjects no one will miss.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.291
Geralt.

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.749
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I made you make that deal.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.791
I fucking knew I never should have
come back here to Bremervoord.

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:39.833
You were right to leave, Jaskier.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.583
Let me go first.

What's a bard to do?

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:54.916
Follow my lead, and stay alive.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.500
[Jaskier] Oh, we are so fucked.

01:01:58.208 --> 01:01:59.583
Maybe not.

with your aunt. The sea witch.

But my prince. Where is he?

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:47.457
[Geralt] He didn't come.

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:52.415
Not even to stop a war?
Not even a little sacrifice...

01:02:52.416 --> 01:02:55.540
He didn't know. And he does love you.

01:02:55.541 --> 01:02:57.291
Love shows up.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:00.041

I stood up for you!

Basim was mine.

01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:38.708
He and I had a real love.

gave him the only thing I couldn't.

I should have been on the throne

Took him!

[Agloval panting]

[Agloval breathes heavily]

01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:02.624
[vodnik snarls]

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:03.958
[breathing heavily]

[somber music playing]

01:09:13.333 --> 01:09:14.166
[Agloval gasps]

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:15.915
[Agloval groans]

01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:18.250
[somber music continues]

01:09:24.958 --> 01:09:27.415
[kraken roars]

01:09:27.416 --> 01:09:28.625
[whimpers]

01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:31.041
[Geralt grunts]

01:09:32.375 --> 01:09:33.499
[Geralt grunts]

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.666

[suspenseful music playing]

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:48.416
- [Sh'eenaz groans]
- [kraken roars]

01:09:52.416 --> 01:09:53.790
[Jaskier grunts]

01:09:53.791 --> 01:09:55.375
I've got this. Go!

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:57.666
[Jaskier grunts]

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:01.165
[grunts]

01:10:01.166 --> 01:10:03.250
[suspenseful music continues]

01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:06.750
Hmm.

01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:12.916
[Geralt growls softly]

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:15.583
[exhales]

[tense music playing]

01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:40.749
[grunts] Whoa!

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:41.833
[Geralt grunts]

01:10:42.916 --> 01:10:43.750

[Geralt strains]

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:56.916
[Geralt strains]

01:11:01.208 --> 01:11:04.083
[Sh'eenaz strains]

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:09.374
- [Sh'eenaz groans]
- Your aunt and I agree on many things.

01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:14.125
Biggest, all our problems
started with you.

01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:24.000
[Geralt groans]

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:29.875
Essi!

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:31.665
[Essi groans]

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:34.041
[suspenseful music playing]

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:38.124
[Usveldt grunts]

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:39.875
[Sh'eenaz screams]

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:42.583
- [Usveldt grunts]
- [Sh'eenaz groans]

01:11:44.666 --> 01:11:47.332
See how you swim now.

01:11:47.333 --> 01:11:49.416
[suspenseful music continues]

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.790
[Agloval crying]

01:11:52.791 --> 01:11:54.875
[suspenseful music continues]

01:12:03.166 --> 01:12:05.000
- [sword slices]
- [Essi strains]

01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:12.041
[tense music playing]

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:16.375
[Geralt grunts]

[Geralt groans]

01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:24.166
[breathes heavily]

01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:27.833
[suspenseful music continues]

01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:42.791
[Geralt grunting]

01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:47.165
[Geralt groans]

01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:48.958
[suspenseful music builds]

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:10.000
[Essie yells] Geralt!

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.416
- [music stops]
- [bottle tinkles]

01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:17.416
[tense music playing]

01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:26.957
[kraken roars]

01:13:26.958 --> 01:13:28.541
- [Jaskier sighs]
- [Usveldt gasps]

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.082
Geralt.

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:32.000
[somber music playing]

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.833
- [kraken shrieks]
- [Dahut groans]

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.000
[bottle tinkles]

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:44.957
[kraken shrieks]

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:47.415
[dramatic music playing]

01:13:47.416 --> 01:13:49.457
[kraken roars]

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.541
[dramatic music continues]

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:57.040
[Geralt yells]

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:59.832
[kraken roars]

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:00.791
[Geralt grunts]

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:08.125
[dramatic music continues]

01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:10.415
[Geralt grunts]

01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:12.500

01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:19.875
[kraken shrieks]

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.666
[kraken roars]

01:14:26.125 --> 01:14:29.458
[kraken groans]

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:40.750
[kraken groans]

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:42.624
[yells]

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:43.666
[gasps]

01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.875
[somber music playing]

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:17.958
[Agloval] Sh'eenaz! Sh'eenaz!

01:15:18.666 --> 01:15:19.624
Sh'eenaz!

01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:22.083
[somber music continues]

01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:26.207
[water burbles]

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:27.124
[Essi gasps]

01:15:27.125 --> 01:15:29.250
[Jaskier whimpers]

01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:32.250
[Geralt exhales softly]

01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:38.040
[Jaskier exhales]

01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:41.249
- I thought you'd become a snack.
- Wouldn't be the first time.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.499
You should have smelled
him after the selkiemaw.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.624
- At least this time he got a bath.
- [Agloval] Where's Sh'eenaz?

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.708
[somber music continues]

01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:56.250
No one's going to blame you
if you leave him here.

01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:58.375
He's still my blood.

01:16:00.666 --> 01:16:01.583
[Usveldt groans]

01:16:02.416 --> 01:16:03.333
[Usveldt exhales]

01:16:05.416 --> 01:16:08.083
- [Usveldt gasps]
- What did you do to her?

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:12.083
[emotional music swells]

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:25.041
- Thank you, Mother.
- You're not the only healer in the family.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.000
[sighs]

01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:32.500
[music fades]

01:16:33.833 --> 01:16:35.833
These creatures are not our enemy!

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:38.000
[gentle music playing]

01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:41.791
And we are not yours.

01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:43.583
We have been tricked!

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:46.416
Misled by those we trusted.

01:16:47.916 --> 01:16:49.750
But the fighting stops now!

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:52.791
We will find a way to live in peace again.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.500
I promise you.

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:57.916
Now, let's go home!

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:23.500
[Usveldt sighs] I apologize, son.

01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:25.125
For everything.

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:28.125
The sea witch proved useful in one way.

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:33.000
There's a potion that allows
its user to take their lover's true form.

01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:35.749
I'm going to marry Sh'eenaz,

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:38.208
and I'd like you to be there.

01:17:38.833 --> 01:17:41.083
There's a way for her to become human?

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:45.291
Hmm. Perhaps there's a way
to open my heart.

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:50.083
Of course, we'll put
all the unpleasantness behind us.

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:52.916
She'll take on a new identity,

01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:56.583
and none in Bremervoord will be the wiser.

01:17:57.541 --> 01:18:00.500
Don't fret. I'll take care of it, son.

01:18:01.291 --> 01:18:02.541
I'm sure you will,

01:18:03.583 --> 01:18:04.416
Father.

01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:07.791
Checkmate.

01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:11.916
[mystical music playing]

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:32.624
[music fades]

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.707
[Jaskier] This is the smallest
royal wedding I've ever attended.

01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:38.083
Princes aren't typically
known for their restraint.

01:18:39.416 --> 01:18:42.083
The fewer witnesses
to this spectacle, the better.

01:18:42.916 --> 01:18:46.500
I suppose in some ways,
you did your job, Witcher.

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:51.125
Once the fish is human,
my line will continue.

01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:54.958
Regardless of your misguided
sense of morality.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:58.000
[jaunty music playing]

01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:07.165
[exhales]

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:09.250
[jaunty music continues]

01:19:33.125 --> 01:19:35.125
[gentle music playing]

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:39.708
[gasps]

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:43.416
[gentle music continues]

01:19:47.458 --> 01:19:51.624
From the moment we locked eyes,
my heart belonged to you, Sh'eenaz.

01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:55.625
You unlocked a version of myself
I didn't know existed.

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:02.750
[gentle music continues]

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:14.250
[suspenseful music playing]

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.875
What are you doing? Stop!

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.790
It's too later, Father!

01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:26.874
You wanted me to hide my beloved,
lie to my kingdom and myself.

01:20:26.875 --> 01:20:28.666
All to feed your own ego.

01:20:29.166 --> 01:20:32.916
It has become clear to me.
There is nothing left for me here.

01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:39.208
[Agloval groans]

01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:49.208
[Agloval yelling in pain]

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
[gentle music playing]

01:21:39.333 --> 01:21:40.332
[music fades]

01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:42.415
This is your fault, Witcher!

01:21:42.416 --> 01:21:44.583
My kingdom. My legacy.

01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:47.166
It will die with me.

01:21:47.958 --> 01:21:49.833
If you saw beyond your pride,

01:21:50.416 --> 01:21:52.082
lives could have been saved.

01:21:52.083 --> 01:21:55.249
You had two sons. Now you have none.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:57.749
That is the legacy you deserve.

01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:59.833
[somber music playing]

01:22:04.041 --> 01:22:07.957
[Jaskier] Agloval's prepared to give up
his entire life and everything he knows.

01:22:07.958 --> 01:22:12.125
- I hope he's made the right decision.
- You did the same thing, Julian.

01:22:12.625 --> 01:22:14.333
I'm sure the prince will be fine.

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.833
[uplifting music playing]

01:22:37.541 --> 01:22:38.624
[music fades]

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:42.082
[Essi] So Agloval got his princess
in the end.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:45.124
Hopefully, this marriage brings peace,
as they hoped.

01:22:45.125 --> 01:22:47.499
I couldn't have figured out
the truth without you.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.958
It's not something I'm used to saying.

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:53.124
You are stubborn and set in your ways,

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:56.166
but there's nothing wrong
with being part of a team.

01:22:57.083 --> 01:22:59.166
Relying on another person.

01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:02.082
- Sharing a life.
- I told you.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:05.082
I've found it wise not to trust others.

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:07.375
Who said love should be wise?

01:23:10.291 --> 01:23:12.291
[gentle music playing]

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:19.041
[Essi moaning softly]

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:31.833
[music fades]

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:34.750
[birds chirping]

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:39.583
[Essi] I know.

01:23:40.291 --> 01:23:41.875
You don't have to say anything.

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:45.624
Essi, I'm sorry.

01:23:45.625 --> 01:23:47.374
[Essi] You don't have to be.

01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:50.874
I've had enough adventure
these past few days to last a lifetime,

01:23:50.875 --> 01:23:53.374
but someone else's lifetime.

01:23:53.375 --> 01:23:56.625
I always wondered what life
would be like if I left Bremervoord.

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:01.208
But the reasons I find you fascinating

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:04.665
are the reasons we cannot be together.

01:24:04.666 --> 01:24:06.832
[gentle music playing]

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:10.249
I could never tame your Witcher heart.
Nor do I want to.

01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:11.458
I want a family.

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:14.499
Stability. Peace.

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.499
That dream seems more farfetched
than a man marrying a mermaid.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.375
You have a larger destiny.

01:24:21.166 --> 01:24:24.332
You care about others,
no matter how hard you try and hide it.

01:24:24.333 --> 01:24:27.332
I track monsters and collect coin.

01:24:27.333 --> 01:24:29.499
That's what Witchers were bred for.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.582
Humans believe in destiny.

01:24:31.583 --> 01:24:34.249
But when you've lived as long as I,

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:37.208
you know there's
no rhyme or reason to this song.

01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:39.874
You simply dance along to get by.

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:41.416
I'm not like you, Essi.

01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:44.458
You're so much more like me
than you imagine.

01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:48.332
I wish you could see that.
Maybe some day you will.

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:51.665
But for now,
looks like Jaskier will have to do.

01:24:51.666 --> 01:24:53.625
[gentle music playing]

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:00.749
[Jaskier] <i>♪ The prince
Did sit aside the sea ♪</i>

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:02.916
<i>♪ Blushing with his siren ♪</i>

01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:10.083
<i>♪ At length did they try to agree
Who'd forfeit their environ ♪</i>

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:17.082
<i>♪ A trade for surf
A swap for turf ♪</i>

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:20.875
<i>♪ Who'd cave first and when ♪</i>

01:25:22.291 --> 01:25:27.040
<i>♪ For if your goal be paradise
A life with your true love ♪</i>

01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:31.665
<i>♪ Ponder all your wants in life ♪</i>

01:25:31.666 --> 01:25:36.958
<i>♪ And make a little sacrifice ♪</i>

01:25:38.625 --> 01:25:41.249
[Jaskier] Aw, would you look at those two?

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:43.582
Can't tell if they're frolicking
or fighting.

01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:46.707
Just because you and your accursed lover
only have two modes

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.041
doesn't mean everyone else does.

01:25:48.625 --> 01:25:52.540
I have great hopes for them.
It's young love, but it's still love.

01:25:52.541 --> 01:25:54.415
I don't doubt that,

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:57.624
but there are still pearls
and greed and bruised egos.

01:25:57.625 --> 01:26:00.999
Kings and queens may claim
they're looking out for their heirs,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.915
but I've yet to meet a royal
who doesn't care more about their vanity

01:26:04.916 --> 01:26:06.082
than their child.

01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:07.416
I wish I weren't right.

01:26:08.083 --> 01:26:10.915
[sighs] No wonder
you're such a hopeless unromantic.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:12.290
Not true.

01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:15.540
It's just that normal humans
have short lives,

01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:17.457
and even shorter memories.

01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:18.999
Essi's wonderful,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.790
but she doesn't understand me like someone
who's lived as long as I have.

01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:25.874
- Someone like--
- Do not say Yennefer.

01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:30.625
Wherever we go next, can we just make sure
we don't run into that she-demon?

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:32.375
Ooh.

01:26:32.958 --> 01:26:34.499
- I've got it!
- [Geralt] Where to?

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:38.124
The farthest corner of the Continent.
No culture. No comforts.

01:26:38.125 --> 01:26:41.124
No reason for that spoiled witch
to be there.

01:26:41.125 --> 01:26:43.458
A place called Caingorn.

01:26:44.041 --> 01:26:45.708
In the Dragon Mountains.

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:51.207
Where adventure awaits!
And Yennefer, notably, does not.

01:26:51.208 --> 01:26:53.291
[hopeful music playing]

01:27:04.333 --> 01:27:06.333
[adventurous music playing]

01:27:51.458 --> 01:27:53.458
[mysterious music playing]

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.500
[music fades]

01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:18.291
[gentle music playing]

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.333
[music fades]
