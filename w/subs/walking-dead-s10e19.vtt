17:29.007 --> 17:30.843

17:30.926 --> 17:33.220
to get drunk is a huge part
of what was wrong with the world.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.888
The point isn't to get drunk.
It's the...

17:36.390 --> 17:38.350
Just take the cup to your nose
and sniff.

17:41.854 --> 17:42.896

19:53.986 --> 19:56.488
Actually, yes, there was. Yes.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.534
I'm serious.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.956
I had a mentor. Reverend George.

20:06.832 --> 20:09.877
He was a good friend
and a great teacher.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.923
And my first class

20:15.257 --> 20:17.593
with him was at a boy's funeral.

20:20.804 --> 20:21.889
Tommy Franklin.

20:24.183 --> 20:28.437
He died of cancer. He was
on his freshman year of college and...

20:31.064 --> 20:32.107
then he died.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.571
And everyone in town
came to the funeral.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.740
Reverend George performed the service.

20:40.699 --> 20:43.452
He spoke as they lowered Tommy
into the ground

20:43.535 --> 20:48.498
and he said all the right things
without even trying.

20:50.334 --> 20:52.878
At least it didn't look like he was.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.051
Anyways,

21:00.385 --> 21:01.428
the funeral ends.

21:02.179 --> 21:04.181
And we get in his car to go to the wake,

21:04.264 --> 21:07.434
and he just takes off.

21:08.519 --> 21:10.604
Eighty. The whole way.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.524
He says, "We have to
get there before the others!"

21:13.607 --> 21:16.026
And he's running stop signs

21:16.109 --> 21:18.779
and saying a prayer each time he does,

21:19.738 --> 21:22.616
and my eyes were closed the whole way.

21:24.368 --> 21:25.410
When we get there...

21:27.037 --> 21:29.414
he heads straight
for the liquor cabinet.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.251
I said, "What are you doing, Reverend?"

21:32.876 --> 21:34.378
And he says, "Shut up, Gabriel!"

21:34.753 --> 21:36.463
And he snatches off my collar.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.591
And then he pulls off his
and he starts pouring.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.554
And when Tommy's father walks in...

21:45.180 --> 21:48.976
Reverend George walks over to him,
two drinks in hand...

21:50.686 --> 21:51.728
and...

21:53.981 --> 21:55.274
He just starts talking.

21:58.527 --> 22:02.406
Just talks to everyone.
And they're at ease.

22:03.824 --> 22:07.494
They're smiling and laughing.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.164
Then he tells me...

22:12.583 --> 22:16.670
all I have to do
is be with them in the moment.

22:19.298 --> 22:21.258
Speak from my heart

22:21.341 --> 22:24.178
and don't worry about
what I think they want to hear.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.055
And I tried,

22:28.015 --> 22:30.684
but I'm not as good at it as he is.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.939
And later, he tells me that

22:36.023 --> 22:38.775
real ministering
isn't preaching from a pulpit,

22:41.153 --> 22:43.447
it's talking to people one-on-one...

22:44.823 --> 22:46.283
on their own terms.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.121
Just relating to them, you know?

22:57.294 --> 22:58.754
That's how I know about whiskey.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.385
That's how I know about a lot of things.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.638
I don't want to preach anymore.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.432
Why?

23:54.309 --> 23:57.437

go back to the way they were?

24:00.524 --> 24:01.692

-I want to see him.

29:51.208 --> 29:53.168
-Why do you wear that?
-What?

29:53.710 --> 29:54.753
The collar.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.256
Why are you still wearin' that?

29:58.423 --> 30:01.009
Probably for the same reason
you keep all those Bibles.

30:02.803 --> 30:05.597
I wear it because the word of God
still matters.

30:06.515 --> 30:09.726
It's a light in an otherwise
very dark world.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.896
And a reminder of the goodness
still within us.

30:13.897 --> 30:17.609
Things like love, mercy, forgiveness.

30:17.734 --> 30:18.777
Toilet paper.

30:20.237 --> 30:21.280
What?

30:22.322 --> 30:23.615
The Bibles.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.076
They're my toilet paper.

30:27.494 --> 30:28.871
I like the thin pages.

30:29.580 --> 30:30.831
And I can find 'em everywhere.

30:31.707 --> 30:34.209
Maybe instead of wiping your ass with it,
you should read it.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.878
(SCOFFS) Yeah, I've read it.

30:36.670 --> 30:39.965
Cover to cover.
That's why I wipe my ass with it.

30:44.887 --> 30:48.015
It must be hard preaching about
something you don't believe in.

30:49.683 --> 30:50.726
I do believe.

30:51.852 --> 30:54.479
"Evil people
aren't the exception to the rule.

30:55.564 --> 30:56.732
"They are the rule."

30:56.940 --> 30:59.693
-I was drunk.
-A drunk tongue's an honest one.

31:00.277 --> 31:03.572
There's nothing left in this world
but thieves and murderers.

31:03.780 --> 31:05.782
No, there's still goodness.

31:06.325 --> 31:07.743
You just have to look for it.

31:08.452 --> 31:10.662
Who are you trying to convince, <i>Padre?</i>

31:11.872 --> 31:13.123
Me or you?

31:19.421 --> 31:20.881
You're so close.

31:24.343 --> 31:25.385
Close to what?

31:39.483 --> 31:40.776
(WHEELS DRAGGING)

32:20.232 --> 32:21.316
One round.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.778

32:35.914 --> 32:37.165
You've got a choice.

32:38.417 --> 32:41.420
Each time you can point it at yourself,

32:42.296 --> 32:44.006
or the man sitting across from you.

Winner goes home.

32:49.303 --> 32:50.429
We're not doing this.

32:51.430 --> 32:52.598
Then you both die.

32:53.223 --> 32:54.766
How do we know you won't
kill us both anyway?

32:55.309 --> 32:56.351
You don't.

32:59.605 --> 33:02.608
We can make this right,
get you a new boar.

33:03.275 --> 33:04.484
It's not about the boar.

33:05.235 --> 33:06.278
Then what is it about?

33:06.612 --> 33:07.696
Enlightenment.

33:10.449 --> 33:11.825
Now go ahead.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.589

34:39.371 --> 34:40.497
It was crushed...

34:42.082 --> 34:43.500
in a construction accident.

34:44.209 --> 34:45.294
Huh.

34:48.547 --> 34:49.631
Who blinded you?

34:50.465 --> 34:53.051
No one. It was an infection.

34:54.553 --> 34:56.889
What, you wanted to hear
that someone plucked my eye out?

34:57.389 --> 35:00.100
Or chopped his arm off? Why?

35:01.018 --> 35:03.812
To prove how evil man is?
That what this is about?

35:04.188 --> 35:05.939
You think I'm going to shoot him
or he's gonna shoot me?

35:06.190 --> 35:07.232
Quiet.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.945
Hey, pick it up and point it
at your head or his.

35:49.775 --> 35:51.610
You got a choice to make, son.

35:58.575 --> 36:00.244
We're not thieves and murderers.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.122
We don't kill each other.

36:05.207 --> 36:08.126
And we protect each other.
We're like family.

36:09.044 --> 36:10.170
Family?

36:11.129 --> 36:12.965
Is that supposed to mean something?

36:14.132 --> 36:15.384
You wanna hear about family?

36:16.844 --> 36:20.180
When I was with my brother
and his family, and we were on the road,

36:20.764 --> 36:23.308
and I saved their lives
more times than I can count.

36:23.392 --> 36:25.644
And then one day, I wake up
and there's my brother

36:25.978 --> 36:27.688
stealing the last of my food.

36:28.730 --> 36:30.399
Then he just stares at me.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.527
And then he comes at me
with a knife and...

36:37.072 --> 36:38.115
What happened?

36:40.701 --> 36:41.743
I handled it.

36:45.247 --> 36:46.665
But I didn't blame my brother...

36:49.543 --> 36:51.712
'cause he gave me
something valuable that day.

36:53.422 --> 36:54.923
He didn't give you anything.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.383
What did you say?

36:58.552 --> 37:00.846
You're just trying to make sense
out of what happened to you,

37:01.138 --> 37:03.182
so you wall yourself off in here

37:03.515 --> 37:06.059
believing that everyone left is evil

37:06.351 --> 37:07.811
or only out for themselves,

37:07.895 --> 37:10.272
because it's easier to accept
than the truth.

37:11.023 --> 37:13.817
That you meant less to your brother
than some scraps of food.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.652
-Gabriel.
-No, he's gonna hear this.

37:16.653 --> 37:19.156
I know something about
looking for the meaning in things,

37:19.656 --> 37:21.074
but most times there isn't any.

37:21.783 --> 37:24.453
No answers, no grand design.

37:24.995 --> 37:26.622
Your brother
didn't give you any enlightenment,

37:26.705 --> 37:27.998
just a ripped-up face.

37:28.123 --> 37:29.875
And you're so full of hate
that you can't see that

37:30.209 --> 37:31.919
you're about to murder two good people.
And for what?

37:32.294 --> 37:33.504
To prove what?

37:34.046 --> 37:35.422
That you aren't any different.

37:35.631 --> 37:37.382
Yes, we are.

37:39.176 --> 37:40.219
Now pull that trigger.

37:41.929 --> 37:42.971
I said, pull it!

37:54.441 --> 37:55.484
What about Gracie?

37:58.403 --> 37:59.821
You wanna see her again, don't you?

38:01.073 --> 38:02.824
Well, then you know what you gotta do.

38:09.581 --> 38:10.624
Don't look at him.

38:11.917 --> 38:13.544
Do you want to see your daughter again
or not?

38:13.669 --> 38:15.879
-Yes, I do!
-Then what are you waiting for?

38:24.888 --> 38:27.933
Three! Two! One!

38:28.308 --> 38:29.560
Stop!

38:31.311 --> 38:32.938
This is who people are!

38:33.230 --> 38:35.148
-This is truth!
-You are wrong.

38:35.941 --> 38:37.192
I was wrong.

38:37.526 --> 38:40.529
People in this world are capable
of more than just killing each other.

38:41.029 --> 38:43.407
They still love, still sacrifice.

38:44.074 --> 38:45.784
Your brother didn't give you any truth.

38:46.410 --> 38:47.786
He just betrayed you.

38:48.662 --> 38:51.456
And if you punish others for his sins,
then you're no better than him.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.294
Now, you weren't always like this.

38:56.378 --> 38:57.421
None of us were.

38:58.547 --> 39:01.383
You have to remember who you were.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.343
-I know who I am!
-I do, too,

39:03.468 --> 39:06.597
because I know people just like you.
We both do.

who've been broken by this world.

39:11.810 --> 39:14.813

Our community is real.

You can, too.
