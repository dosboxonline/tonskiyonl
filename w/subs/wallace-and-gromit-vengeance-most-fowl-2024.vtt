We've got someone here you might
be interested in.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.000
Mm-hm!

Feathers McGraw, you have been found

of the Blue Diamond.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.160
If not for the actions of
two upstanding citizens,

01:29.200 --> 01:33.080
you would have succeeded in
your wicked plan.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.600
Therefore, it is the decision of
this court that, for the rest of

01:37.640 --> 01:43.880

04:34.880 --> 04:36.920
How's my favourite pooch, hmm?

Mm.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.520
Oh, yes...

04:53.440 --> 04:55.280
Mm. Hmm.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.520
Mm!

05:02.440 --> 05:03.800
Mm... Mm!

05:03.840 --> 05:05.520
Cracking toast, Gromit.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.000
Oh, dear. More bills?

05:17.040 --> 05:20.000
Inventing doesn't come cheap,
does it?

05:22.280 --> 05:25.200
Maybe I'm just making too many
gadgets.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.920
Oh, don't worry, lad.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.760
We'll think of something.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.040
You look like you need a good pat.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.560
Come here!

05:43.440 --> 05:44.960
That's it, lad!

06:41.840 --> 06:45.360

07:07.960 --> 07:09.920
I'm your Nifty Odd-Jobbing Robot.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.920
Call me NORBOT!

07:11.960 --> 07:14.160
Norbot, meet Gromit.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.520
Pleased to meet you, Master Gromit!

07:16.560 --> 07:18.040
He's very friendly.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.720
CHUCKLING: Oh, steady on, Norbot!

07:22.760 --> 07:24.280
Well, go on, chuck.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.280
Why don't you put him through
his little paces?

07:27.320 --> 07:29.240
He's voice-activated.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.320
Ha-ha! Bit shy, are we?

07:32.360 --> 07:33.520
All right.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.080
Norbot, make Gromit's garden
neat and tidy.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.480
Neat and tidy!

07:40.040 --> 07:42.120
Yes, Mr Wallace!

07:42.160 --> 07:44.840
I've pre-programmed him
for you, lad.

07:44.880 --> 07:49.000
He's watched every episode of
DIY Garden Squad there is.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.280
Only two hours to go, and they still
haven't got the patio down!

07:53.320 --> 07:57.160
Just watch him do all those
tedious gardening tasks.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.000
Chop, chop, chop!

08:13.080 --> 08:14.560
Careful, lad.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.360
Pointlessly blowing leaves around!

08:21.440 --> 08:23.160
Oh, whoops-a-daisy.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.840

08:26.880 --> 08:28.520

# I love to do a job! #

08:47.240 --> 08:49.160
Oh, he's a little treasure,
that one.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.920
Amazing job.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.000
And very convenient.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.480
Well, well.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.880
Looks like you've "made the cut",
Norbot.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.800
Better take a bow.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.520
Bowing!

09:00.560 --> 09:03.000
Bowing again! Where did
you get him from? Thank you!

09:03.040 --> 09:05.720
Well, actually, I made him myself.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.440
What fun! Is he for hire?

09:08.480 --> 09:11.000
Is he for hire? Ha-ha...

09:11.040 --> 09:13.160
Oh...
TING

09:16.080 --> 09:18.080
Come on, I need your help.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.920
Not you, lad. Norbot.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.480
Yes, Mr Wallace.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.720
How may I assist?

09:26.760 --> 09:30.000
Come along, Norbot, lad.
We've got work to do.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.640
Righto, Mr Wallace.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.040
It's a crime.
That's what it is, a crime!

09:37.080 --> 09:39.440
That you and I can't be together.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.080
Mwah!

09:41.120 --> 09:43.440
Not yet, my sweetness.

09:43.480 --> 09:44.560
Soon, though.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.840

Oh...! Eh?

09:46.880 --> 09:48.480
Got a mo', Chief? Wha...?

09:48.520 --> 09:51.800
I've just finished my investigation
into that missing bike saddle.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.120
I've got witness interviews, crime
scene reports, full forensics.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.520
Mukherjee...

09:56.560 --> 09:58.520
AND I checked the National Bike
Saddle database.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.040
There isn't one, apparently.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.720
Mukherjee! Chief?

10:01.760 --> 10:03.000
Oh...

10:03.040 --> 10:04.920
How long have you been with us now?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.840
Since 9am this morning, Chief.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.160
Well, you can forget what you've
learned at training college.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.080
Because at the end of the day,
there's just one thing that matters

10:13.120 --> 10:15.600
in this job - a copper's gut.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.640
Copper's gut, sir?
Instinct!

10:19.040 --> 10:20.920
The important stuff's not up here.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.680
It's down here.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.640
Yeah, I've got quite a copper's gut
meself, actually.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.720
Oh, I can see that, Chief.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.640
I mean, I, uh...
MUKHERJEE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

10:29.680 --> 10:31.960
I didn't mean I can see...

10:32.000 --> 10:33.480
..it.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.120
Oh! Is that Feathers McGraw?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.680
Oh, what?! Where?!

10:38.040 --> 10:40.040
Oh, that.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.640
Well, there you go - a copper's gut.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.480
He stole the Blue Diamond, right?

10:44.520 --> 10:45.880
Oh, he tried.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.920
But he couldn't escape the long
arm of the law.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.920
Oh, yes, I played my part.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.840

10:54.880 --> 10:56.360

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
WALLACE: Oh, is that the police?

10:58.440 --> 11:01.160
The Blue Diamond ended up back in
the museum vault.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.280
I locked it up meself,
well out of harm's way.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.840
Oh, I'd love to crack a case
like that.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.720
You must be dead proud, Chief.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.800
It's not...it's not about pride,
Mukherjee.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.520
It's about duty.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.440
Which is why I've accepted
one last task

11:18.480 --> 11:19.920
before I hang up me truncheon.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.240
Oh?

11:21.280 --> 11:23.280
The new Blue Diamond exhibition.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.080
The diamond's going back on display?

11:25.120 --> 11:26.560
Oh, aye.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.040
I've designed all the security
arrangements meself.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.560
Foolproof.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.800
Yeah!

11:31.840 --> 11:34.640
Well, not unless Feathers cuts
a hole in that skylight.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.840
Skylight?

11:35.880 --> 11:37.440
Or he removes the back plate off
the air con.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.640
Air what?

11:38.680 --> 11:40.640
Oh! Actually, he could just get in
through the gift shop.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.000
There's a gift shop?!

11:42.040 --> 11:44.600
Look, Feathers isn't going to
get in, is he?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.840
He's safely banged up in the zoo.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.080
Literally doing bird.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.960
Now, I've got a grand opening
to prepare for.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.840
So get out there on the beat.
Burn some shoe leather.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.160
Yes!

11:56.200 --> 11:58.160
Ahem. I mean, yes...sir.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.600
Hrmph!

11:59.640 --> 12:01.040
DOOR SLAMS

12:01.080 --> 12:02.560
WALLACE: Oh, yes.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.360
That's it, Norbot, make the letters
nice and big.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.880
Oh-ho! Oh, that's just smashing.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.840
I think you're going to like this,
Gromit.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.320
Ta-da!

12:14.360 --> 12:16.160
Ta-d-a-aa!

12:16.200 --> 12:18.360
Gnome Improvements!

12:18.400 --> 12:21.080
A gnome-based garden
and maintenance service.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.600
Woohoo! I told you we'd find a way
to pay the bills, lad.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.240
Uh, Norbot?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.920
Haven't you missed something?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.920
Oh! Yes, Mr Wallace.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.120
Oh, yes, very good.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.680
Good job, Norbot.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.120
Oh, yes.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.560
BEEP! BEEP!

12:45.600 --> 12:47.240
Yoo-hoo! Hmm?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.440
Oh, it's Up North News!

12:49.480 --> 12:52.080
Maybe they've heard about
our Norbot.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.160
Oh, this'll be great for publicity.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.320
And now, Up North News,

12:57.360 --> 12:59.720
presented by Anton Deck!

13:02.360 --> 13:03.920
Good evening.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.720
Now, we've all heard of
cutting-edge technology -

13:06.760 --> 13:09.760
but how about cutting HEDGE
technology?

13:09.800 --> 13:11.040
Hee-hee!

13:11.080 --> 13:13.640
Onya Doorstep has more.

13:13.680 --> 13:18.720
Meet Norbot, the latest thing
in GNOME help.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.760
He's the brainchild of a
smart-thinking local inventor.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.840
Oh, "smart-thinking".

13:24.880 --> 13:26.640
Oh, thank you very much.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.000
So, Wallace, what can Norbot do
around the house?

13:32.040 --> 13:36.200
Oh, well, pretty much everything,
Ms Doorstep.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.800

Ta-da!

13:44.880 --> 13:46.320
Artistic!

13:46.360 --> 13:49.720
I've been testing him out here
in my own garden,

13:49.760 --> 13:52.600
and he's done a cracking job,
as you can see.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.440
He certainly seems very
user-friendly, to use the jargon.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.040
So, what inspired you to create this
handy device, Mr Wallace?

14:03.080 --> 14:05.760
Oh, I've always loved inventing.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.840
Making things that help people.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.720
And Norbot is so very helpful.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.520
I'd say he's my greatest invention
so far.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.360
We charge him up every night,

14:16.400 --> 14:19.400
and the next day he's raring
to go again.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.080
He seems very obliging.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.280
Oh, whatever your problem...
he's the answer!

14:28.120 --> 14:31.000
Well, sounds like this little gnome
is going to make

14:31.040 --> 14:33.920
a huge difference around here.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.880

we haven't had to

15:20.920 --> 15:23.520

Just bring him in and book him.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.760
I've got a speech to write.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.960
Really? Don't we need...

31:28.000 --> 31:29.440

31:29.480 --> 31:30.960
Oh, I don't know.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.840

32:06.880 --> 32:09.720
Oh, yes, I do like a bit of

There's our evidence, Chief.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.560
All right, check 'em out, then.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.440
Well, I don't see any gnomes.

37:25.480 --> 37:26.960
Eh?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.640
They were here a moment ago.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.600

43:15.040 --> 43:17.520
There's nothing here to pin Wallace
to the burglaries.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.560
They're his gnomes, aren't they?

that...

43:21.960 --> 43:23.960

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.240
I think that's Feathers McGraw,
Chief!

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.200
They're trying to stop
Feathers McGraw!

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.360
Feathers McGraw?!
Don't be ridiculous.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.360
He's banged up in the zoo.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.480
That's just an innocent nun,
out for a pleasure cruise.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.920
I just think maybe Wallace
has been unfairly portrayed

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.440
as a crazed inventor.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.440

right about you being innocent.
