WEBVTT

00:05.130 --> 00:06.214
Wait.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.718
Take a minute,
then we're almost there.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.928
About three miles out.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.096
You can't be serious.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.890
Daryl just told us to go home.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.267
I didn't hear that.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.979
Well, I think he was being subtle.
He said they were armed with lookouts.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.773
And Daryl knows
I would never turn back.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.984
How're you gonna keep going, Maggie, huh?

00:25.984 --> 00:27.318
With what army?

00:29.612 --> 00:32.323
Come on, Gabe, back me up here.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.326
Our people are about to starve.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.704
I'm not going back
to my family having failed.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.913
Oh, Jesus.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.208
At least admit what you're asking of us...

00:42.375 --> 00:45.712
walking to our deaths for what,
a sack of beans?

00:46.129 --> 00:48.089
If you're more interested
in saving yourself

00:48.256 --> 00:50.592
than protecting the people back home,

00:51.134 --> 00:52.343
you can go.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.597
We don't need you.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.433
We both know that's not true.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.978
All right, tell you what.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.190
You make me a promise
in front of the goddamn preacher

01:05.190 --> 01:06.608
and I will stick around.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.901
Promise you what?

01:08.485 --> 01:09.861
I do this for you,

01:11.446 --> 01:12.822
and we're even, we are good.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.658
I don't have to keep looking
over my shoulder.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.579
We will never be even.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.625
Then you are gonna be down a soldier
that you desperately need.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.793
Your call.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.759
You'd take a promise from me?

01:33.301 --> 01:34.344
Really?

01:35.887 --> 01:38.014
Yeah. Who wouldn't?

01:38.515 --> 01:41.017
I'm assuming you are
a woman of your word.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.895
I've always been a man of mine.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.665
What is it?

02:34.571 --> 02:36.573
It's his sister's best friend.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.116
Teresa.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.285
She was just a kid.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.124
We have to get them.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.004
All of them.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.551
Hey.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.387
Y'all know Blackbeard, too?

03:06.477 --> 03:07.520
Wait.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.820
Think we can find more?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.226
You're doing great.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.980
I'm doing okay, not great.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.816
The timeline since this was last

04:34.816 --> 04:36.943
an essential activity
in your daily routine

04:36.943 --> 04:40.613
and the necessity for it
should be factors in your self-judgment.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.615
The military does this for us.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.617
It's been so long since I've had to.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.787
It's not like riding a bicycle, turns out.
You do forget.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.165
That's the good ol' cerebellum
protecting you from unpleasant memories.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.128
I remember the good stuff.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.762
Stephanie, I have to ask.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.890
You've known Hornsby a long time?

05:08.599 --> 05:09.851
Pretty long, why?

05:12.854 --> 05:15.315
Is he capable of taking care of our...

05:16.649 --> 05:17.900
transgressions?

05:19.235 --> 05:20.445
In other words,

05:20.445 --> 05:24.615
will all this labor
truly lead to our freedom?

05:25.825 --> 05:27.535
If he says it will, it will.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.205
Lance has his own way of doing things.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.875
But you can trust him.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.210
You'll see.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.974
Whoa. Let me take over.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.476
- I got this.
- I can help, it's fine.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.686
- No, it's not!
- It will be.

05:58.691 --> 05:59.817
Ezekiel!

06:01.277 --> 06:02.278
What?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.614
I love you, but you got
to give me space, man.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.449
Can you just clear these?

06:11.788 --> 06:12.997
God!

06:18.002 --> 06:19.295
Think I got the last of them.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.838
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.757
Fine.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.219
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
It's just so cramped in there.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.387
Nah, it's cool.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.353
Ezekiel, what can I do?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.480
It's dusty.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.400
I'm sure that's it.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.485
Mm-hmm.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.946
Y'all need help clearing your area?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.574
Steph, how much longer we got to do this?

06:48.658 --> 06:49.826
It's been days.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.078
Uh, a couple more, I guess.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.663
He won't make it a few more days.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.914
I'm fine.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.707
No, you need to see a doctor.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.960
I'm not gonna leave you alone
to work out here.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.004
Don't be stupid! Yeah, I said it.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.799
They got real hospitals and shit here.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.636
Can you make that happen?

07:09.262 --> 07:12.390
Uh, yeah, I'll talk
to Mr. Hornsby right now.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.475
Thank you. We are much obliged.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.938
If this becomes another debt
we have to work off...

07:18.938 --> 07:20.690
Never been afraid of hard work.

07:21.065 --> 07:24.068
Kinda anti friends who die
from stubbornness.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.324
Oh. Mercer,
this is way too close to

07:30.408 --> 07:34.162
where the nasties are working.
The smell is... revolting.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.504
Who the hell was that?

07:45.631 --> 07:48.801
Our recruiters were
incredibly impressed with you.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.386
Were they?

07:50.678 --> 07:52.638
I thought maybe they found me difficult.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.808
Well, we expect a person
with your pedigree

07:55.892 --> 07:57.059
to have high standards.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.853
We certainly do at State.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.816
Well, Ms. Milton
has great affection

08:03.900 --> 08:05.651
for her fellow Harvard grads.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.196
Should be no trouble
finding a position for you.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.407
I'm happy to work to pay
for the aid for my community,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.035
but I'm not staying here permanently.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.453
I just want to make that clear.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.206
After you meet Ms. Milton,
you might reconsider.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.376
I'd rather see my friends.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.796
Actually, can somebody take me to where
they're working, please?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.173
They broke the law.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.385
Mr. Hornsby has arranged for their release
with a fine that they're repaying.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.179
What?

08:33.179 --> 08:36.891
Yeah, I believe they're clearing buildings
for future development.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.809
Clearing them of what, exactly?

08:39.685 --> 08:40.853
The dead.

08:41.145 --> 08:45.775
Okay, so they're assigned
to clear walkers for days, weeks?

08:46.275 --> 08:47.902
Months, maybe?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.656
And I'm expected to provide
legal services to...

08:51.656 --> 08:53.658
Ms. Milton and her cabinet.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.742
Right.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.662
Then I'd like to speak with her.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.121
Right away, please.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.208
Well, that would be difficult.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.168
Why is that exactly?

09:04.502 --> 09:08.422
It's just Mr. Hornsby's expectations
of the timing were a little different.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.091
Is he your supervisor?

09:10.800 --> 09:11.801
No.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.762
Then I'd like to speak to her right away.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.639
Please.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.604
Come on, boy.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.037
You need any help in there?

09:40.288 --> 09:41.289
No.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.799
You want one?

09:52.383 --> 09:53.467
Sure.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.180
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.482
Here they come! Open up!

10:10.192 --> 10:11.861
On it, on it!

10:12.486 --> 10:14.113
Sounds like patrol has come home.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.823
- Yo, let them in.
- Yep.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.374
Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord,

10:25.458 --> 10:29.420
even so saith the Spirit,
for they rest from their labors.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.673
We say, "The Lord be with you
and thy Spirit."

10:34.050 --> 10:35.760
Amen.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.389
If your sister's out there...
we'll find her.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.561
And every last one of these murderers.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.064
All of them.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.359
But the one...

10:53.235 --> 10:54.487
he's mine.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.008
There are scouts everywhere.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.677
I'll be careful.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.429
If you get a chance to kill one of them,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.225
if he's alone
and you have the advantage...

11:24.934 --> 11:26.018
I will.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.822
You ready?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.409
I'm not cutting up anyone I know.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.661
You're gonna have to find me
four strangers.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.038
Only need three.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.084
I kept my mask for practical
and sentimental reasons.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.627
This is not fun.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.796
Well, not with that attitude.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.341
Let's get it over with.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.112
We did three different sweeps.
No signs of tracks anywhere, sir.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.241
You try the buildings out by the lake?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.492
Yes, sir.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.619
- Along the train tracks?
- Yes, sir.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.079
Freeway underpasses?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.331
- Yes, sir.
- Come on!

12:29.415 --> 12:32.251
There are dozens
of these assholes out there!

12:32.251 --> 12:33.627
- Pope.
- No!

12:40.426 --> 12:42.511
Your brothers are dead!

12:45.389 --> 12:47.099
Are you not ashamed?

12:48.476 --> 12:51.228
Or do you think this is acceptable?

12:52.271 --> 12:54.648
They were following my recommendations.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.525
I told them where the last teams went.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.277
I told them where to go next.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.448
You want to scream at somebody,
scream at me.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.535
You trying to be noble?
Is that it, Shaw?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.165
You trying to get them to like you?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.794
Try keeping them alive.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.338
And yelling at them is gonna do that?

13:31.435 --> 13:32.645
Go be useful.

13:34.438 --> 13:39.151
Take your boy over there
and go and find my goddamn enemies!

13:49.453 --> 13:50.871
Come on. We have orders.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.836
Stay.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.175
You all right?

14:03.634 --> 14:04.885
I'm fine.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.477
I'm sure the guys are grateful
for what you did back there.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.396
How do you know that?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.189
I'd be.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.818
I don't know. It may have been stupid.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.778
No, you got a good place.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.865
I'm sure there's a good story
that goes with it.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.700
Well, you spent some time
with those people.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.243
I'm sure they have their sides.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.078
No, not at all.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.666
Well, we needed a place.
We found one.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.626
You can fill in the rest.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.008
You got something to say about it?

14:44.008 --> 14:45.634
No. I'm just surprised is all.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.969
Surprised why?

14:48.429 --> 14:49.555
You won.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.932
You got the walls. You got the food.

14:52.516 --> 14:53.767
Why keep hunting?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.604
We have to make sure
they don't come back.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.356
Okay.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.026
You know, you don't understand.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.446
It's easy for you out here on your own,
only having to worry about yourself.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.907
We have a whole community to protect.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.825
And we have a structure.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.703
And a leader who got us this far.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.789
What happened back there...
that was... that wasn't normal.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.125
Yeah, I met guys like that before.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.837
Pope's got a puzzle to solve,
and he's riled up.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.967
How can these people be so hard to find?

15:30.930 --> 15:34.391
So, you kill everybody, and then
he goes back to being a good guy?

15:34.475 --> 15:35.768
He's like a father to me.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.395
He believed in me
when no one else would.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.564
He made me strong.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.484
I doubt you ever needed anyone
to make you strong.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.014
Lower your shoulders.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.058
Arms limp.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.895
That's good, Maggie.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.438
Back to the tree.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.484
This piece of shit.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.155
It's not gonna fit you perfectly.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.074
It was... someone else's face.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.911
Look, this might actually work.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.290
And I mean it.
If I can do it, you can do it.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.461
I'll take this back,
work on it, fix it for you.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.671
Then we'll try it again.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.716
You did good, Maggie.

18:18.222 --> 18:22.684
Blessed are they who die in the Lord,
so saith the Spirit.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.397
Blessed are they who die in the Lord,

18:27.481 --> 18:31.235
so saith the Spirit,
for they rest from their labors.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.028
Blessed are they who...

18:56.552 --> 18:57.553
Tell me, Father.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.186
You have guided me
through the darkest of times.

19:09.314 --> 19:13.193
I treasure our conversation
and the guidance you have given me.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.696
Is there anything I should know?

19:28.125 --> 19:29.293
Thank you, Father.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.137
(OVER PA) <i>Enlist in
the Commonwealth Army today.</i>

19:40.262 --> 19:41.972
<i>- Help protect...</i>
- How long is your break?

19:42.347 --> 19:43.599
Not long.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.852
Just enough to show you
my dorm room and then get back.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.271
You've always lived in a dorm here?

19:49.271 --> 19:50.856
Yeah. It's great.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.316
Tomi, I'm sorry.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.693
I just don't understand
why you wouldn't want the life

19:54.693 --> 19:56.278
that comes along
with being a doctor here.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.698
I don't want to go back to before.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.074
Well, it wouldn't be the same.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.994
- Dad isn't here to put pressure on you.
- It wasn't just Dad.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.080
And you liked that type of life,
but I didn't.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.499
Never turning it off, never sleeping,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.460
everything moving too fast.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.714
People who burn themselves out for work
until they die or want to?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.716
<i>Do your part to keep our community safe.</i>

20:17.716 --> 20:20.219
Hey, you used to love the job.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.305
I remember how you used to look
when you saved someone,

20:23.305 --> 20:25.057
- when you told somebody good news.
- Please stop. Please stop.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.558
<i>That's the Commonwealth way.</i>

20:26.642 --> 20:27.643
Sit.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.360
No one can know that I was a doctor, okay?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.028
Promise me.

20:38.528 --> 20:41.406
- What does that mean?
- Just trust me, okay?

20:44.034 --> 20:46.245
I like things the way they are.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.789
This place makes sense.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.749
- There's order, a system...
- Okay!

20:50.749 --> 20:51.875
Okay.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.127
Fine.

20:54.211 --> 20:57.714
<i>Enlist in the Commonwealth Army today.
Help protect your neighbors</i>

20:57.798 --> 21:00.050
<i>and defend our home.</i>

21:00.050 --> 21:02.761
<i>Remember, we're all in this together.</i>

21:02.886 --> 21:05.347
I have a meeting with Pamela Milton later.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.891
Anything I should know?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.853
That's nice for you.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.690
Someone like me
would never meet Ms. Milton.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.066
Why not?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.360
You have to know your place.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.488
- You.
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

21:21.488 --> 21:22.781
- Hey! Hey!
- What do you think I did?

21:22.781 --> 21:24.074
I did nothing wrong, I swear.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.659
Hey! Stop! I'm his lawyer.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.286
- He's entitled to hear his rights.
- Miko, Miko, no.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.454
- Miko, leave it alone.
- Come on. Move it.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.206
<i>That's the Commonwealth way.</i>

22:15.417 --> 22:16.626
I told you you'd get it right.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.589
Congrats and you're welcome.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.262
Has he changed?

22:33.643 --> 22:35.771
We can't know that.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.942
He's helpful.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.614
He would be,
long as there's something in it for him.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.242
So, your promise?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.207
I hope I can keep it.

23:00.128 --> 23:03.131
You know, keep an eye open
for which one you want,

23:03.215 --> 23:05.175
because as soon as we restock,
you've got first dibs.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.135
Hey! I need to talk to you.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.433
- Where the hell is my brother?
- He's fine.

23:13.725 --> 23:14.935
That wasn't my question.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.146
You made an appointment with Pamela,

23:18.522 --> 23:21.691
even after I told you and your friends
that I was taking care of things.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.443
You almost screwed everything up.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.445
You kidnapped my brother off the street.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.280
Fair enough.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.658
He'll be home tonight.
That's how much time I need.

23:29.991 --> 23:30.992
For what?

23:31.993 --> 23:34.162
All right, it works like this.
It's real simple.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.873
Your people need help, right?

23:37.124 --> 23:40.210
And you want your friends,
who broke the law, to go free.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.671
Those are big asks.

23:43.672 --> 23:44.798
I can deliver for you.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.593
There must be something in it for you.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.765
A friend in high places.

23:54.933 --> 24:00.522
Someday, I might need a favor,
and you might be... favorably inclined.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.525
So what do you say?

24:03.817 --> 24:05.694
Can you sit tight for a few more hours?

24:09.239 --> 24:10.490
A few hours.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.159
Excellent.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.139
Hey.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.479
Patrol has been all through here.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.647
They've checked every building for miles.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.107
These trails should be cold.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.696
Well, it looks like
someone's been through here.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.073
Heads up.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.003
Come out! Hands up.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.800
Please, don't shoot.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.011
I have a family who needs me.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.597
- Please.
- You staying over there?

25:17.098 --> 25:19.309
- No.
- How'd you avoid the patrols?

25:19.768 --> 25:20.769
What?

25:21.144 --> 25:23.647
There's been soldiers
looking for people like you.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.773
How'd you avoid them?

25:25.106 --> 25:26.441
I don't know what that means.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.069
- Then you're of no use to us.
- You don't know what we've been through.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.695
My wife is hurt real bad.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.073
I can't... I can't care for her
and look for food.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.325
Please just... just let me go.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.538
Show us or I'll shoot
and find your family later.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.499
Okay.

25:42.916 --> 25:45.293
Just please don't hurt us.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.045
Move.

25:49.714 --> 25:50.715
Shaw to Pope.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.426
- Hold up.
- <i>Go ahead, Shaw.</i>

25:53.510 --> 25:55.011
We found a man in the woods.

25:55.428 --> 25:58.348
Not sure if he's a part of our targets.
He's taking us to his people.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.933
How do you want us to engage?

26:01.017 --> 26:02.060
<i>Kill them.</i>

26:05.814 --> 26:06.856
Copy that.

26:08.441 --> 26:09.442
Move.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.061
You know, I feel for you in all of this.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.440
You might think that's bullshit,

26:49.482 --> 26:50.692
but it's true.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.611
How's that?

26:54.195 --> 26:55.697
I'm not a robot, Rhee.

26:55.697 --> 26:58.074
It sucks to see your friends as walkers.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.287
And that would be enough.

27:03.538 --> 27:05.582
But you are about to do some crazy shit

27:05.582 --> 27:08.668
and break into a community
that you built and lost.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.088
I get it.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.801
Your community and mine,
were lost in very different ways.

27:16.968 --> 27:20.430
You think I don't understand
the losing side of a massacre?

27:20.847 --> 27:23.266
There were no children
at the satellite station.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.935
No families.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.230
Then where'd Aaron get Gracie?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.277
You think I don't know about that?

27:34.861 --> 27:36.946
You can't debate battle plans with me.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.116
Levels of cruelty.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.118
Look, all I'm saying is that I remember

27:42.202 --> 27:44.913
when my home was invaded
and my people were killed.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.751
Those men... they had friends.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.836
They had girlfriends.

27:52.712 --> 27:57.092
People that felt a loss
that I couldn't heal.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.428
And I had to explain to them why...

28:02.013 --> 28:04.391
why their leader failed to protect them.

28:05.558 --> 28:07.727
You killed people who had families.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.566
And you did it in front of their families.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.610
Yeah.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.862
I did.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.907
But the world is different now, Maggie.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.537
Fewer people to fight for, fight with.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.290
Hell, there's fewer things to fight over.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.672
Are you saying
you'd do things differently?

28:40.176 --> 28:41.386
Yeah.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.306
Yeah, if I could do it all over again...

28:48.017 --> 28:49.936
I'd have killed every single one of you.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.490
Why would you say that?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.119
It's the truth.

29:07.787 --> 29:11.958
We got to do whatever we can
to protect our people, right?

29:11.958 --> 29:15.086
I mean, that's why we're here.
That's why we're doing this.

29:17.964 --> 29:20.467
Why would you say that to me?

29:28.141 --> 29:29.893
We had a good day, you and I.

29:31.811 --> 29:35.023
And the only way this works, Maggie, is...

29:37.150 --> 29:38.318
is if we're honest.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.165
Where do they bring these, exactly?

29:52.457 --> 29:53.917
Uh, I don't know.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.961
Somewhere far from the fields
and the water supply.

29:57.253 --> 29:58.713
Friends!

29:59.047 --> 30:01.424
Much gratitude.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.219
I see you've done all my work for me.

30:04.552 --> 30:07.055
And I didn't even bring you lollipops.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.473
Wait.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.683
Ha!

30:13.186 --> 30:15.980
- You don't want one?
- Oh, I have had several.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.358
- So, how was it?
- Good as new.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.444
I got antibiotics, painkillers, IV fluids.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.990
Thank you, truly, friend.

30:26.282 --> 30:29.035
Happy to do it.
Glad everyone's okay.

30:29.744 --> 30:32.080
You feel up to a new assignment or...

30:32.247 --> 30:33.289
Yes!

30:35.875 --> 30:36.960
Bring it on.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.088
Stephanie, Eugene,

30:40.463 --> 30:43.466
I'd like you to clear the area
up along the north fence line.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.593
- Can you show him?
- Yeah, sure.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.639
Excellent. Ezekiel,
Princess, come with me.

31:04.904 --> 31:05.947
Maggie.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.160
Good news.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.454
It's still there.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.123
You run into any of them?

31:16.291 --> 31:17.375
No.

31:35.602 --> 31:36.978
That looks good over there.

31:47.697 --> 31:48.781
Come on, man.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.328
I got this one.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.502
Eugene!

32:13.222 --> 32:14.515
Thanks, partner.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.893
Teamwork is all.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.019
Yeah.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.981
What the hell was that about?

32:22.273 --> 32:24.025
You just disrupted our date.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.945
Excuse me. We just saved your life.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.529
We have private security for that.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.740
Eugene, let's go.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.575
They're... You know what?
Best idea yet.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.577
Well, there's no reason
to be so rude, hoss.

32:34.702 --> 32:36.371
Hoss?

32:37.163 --> 32:39.791
Oh, my God. Sorry. I'm just not used
to talking to a plebeian, so this is...

32:39.791 --> 32:40.959
Oh, someone used their dictionary.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.543
- Hey, Eugene.
- Now, just a minute.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.545
We have earned either gratitude
or an apology,

32:44.629 --> 32:46.172
whichever this young man can muster first.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.341
- Eugene.
- Who the hell do you think that you are?

32:48.341 --> 32:49.759
I think I'm talking to someone who's being
extremely rude right now.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.261
- Eugene.
- Now just hold your horses one second.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.305
You have no idea
who you're talking to right now. Eugene.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.349
Oh, I think I do, and that would
be a tiny, little man.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.642
You're so smart.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.024
You stupid bitch!

33:05.233 --> 33:07.193
Look what you just did to my girlfriend!

33:10.613 --> 33:12.281
Oh, my God! What did you do?

33:12.365 --> 33:15.243
This guy was being, well, an asshole.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.786
- Look, we're so sorry.
- No, don't touch!

33:16.786 --> 33:20.456
We've been working without a break,
and he didn't mean to.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.834
What the hell happened here?

33:23.251 --> 33:25.545
Look what they did to Kayla.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.797
These lunatics attacked us.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.174
You know, this is all your fault, Mercer.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.801
Where the hell were you?

33:31.801 --> 33:34.804
I had goddamn rotters up my ass!

33:34.804 --> 33:38.516
And then this dumb shit
rolled up and attacked me.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.435
That is categorically untrue.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.978
Did you hit him?

33:42.603 --> 33:44.897
- Yes, but...
- What the hell were you thinking?

33:45.732 --> 33:47.191
Don't you know who that is?

33:57.452 --> 33:59.620
Hi. I'm Yumiko Okumura.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.539
I'm here for my meeting with Ms. Milton.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.833
Thank you for being on time.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.419
Ms. Milton is fastidious
about her schedule.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.713
Would you like an herbal tea?

34:09.130 --> 34:10.465
No, thank you.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.675
Sparkling water or espresso?

34:12.759 --> 34:14.218
No. I'm all right.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.637
Please, have a seat.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.676
You're part of the new group
that came in, right?

34:58.679 --> 35:00.765
Yeah. I guess.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.268
- Are you all settling in okay?
- Yeah.

35:04.393 --> 35:09.023
I mean, I haven't seen
my friends in a few days, so...

35:11.567 --> 35:14.487
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.030
Is everyone okay?

35:18.783 --> 35:19.826
Yes?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.623
Yes. Of course. I'll... I'll do it now.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.752
Is everything okay?

35:30.044 --> 35:32.255
I'm afraid Ms. Milton
will have to reschedule.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.632
Someone just attacked her son.

36:05.204 --> 36:08.749
Situation like that,
you're supposed to save him,

36:09.625 --> 36:12.295
protect the governor's son.
You'd have been a hero.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.922
You could have asked
for anything.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.632
My apologies.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.552
I did not ascertain such a conclusion.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.431
All right, no more screwing around.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.478
You want out, now the price is higher.

36:31.647 --> 36:33.774
I need the name of your town
and how to get there.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.735
That is beyond my purview.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.156
Then welcome.

36:41.657 --> 36:42.950
This is home.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.996
Your friends can keep killing walkers.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.624
Your people, wherever they are...

36:51.125 --> 36:52.960
can figure things out on their own.

37:00.259 --> 37:04.180
If I were to disclose those coordinates,
what guarantee could you provide

37:04.180 --> 37:05.848
for my community's safety?

37:06.474 --> 37:07.516
Look around.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.268
Think how we've treated you.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.854
All the chances you've gotten.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.941
That's not a directly reply to my query.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.695
Up to you.

37:26.702 --> 37:27.954
Wait.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.188
See? I told you the truth.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.024
Please don't hurt us.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.243
You need to take your son and run.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.621
Don't ever come back here.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.920
Go with your dad.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.339
Go ahead, honey.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.883
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.311
I love you.

40:39.770 --> 40:40.980
I love you.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.691
Go.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.369
Oh, thank God for you.

40:56.495 --> 40:57.997
He answered my prayers.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.834
They were never gonna leave
while I was still alive,

41:02.376 --> 41:04.295
and it was dangerous for them to stay.

41:08.924 --> 41:10.009
I'm ready.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.014
Please.

41:47.046 --> 41:48.339
What are you gonna tell Pope?

41:51.300 --> 41:52.635
That you killed them.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.678
It'll be good for you.

42:17.576 --> 42:20.496
Look, Leah, there's something
I need to tell you.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.122
<i>Come in, Shaw.</i>

42:23.415 --> 42:24.792
Shaw. Over.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.044
<i>We need you back ASAP.</i>

42:28.629 --> 42:29.672
We gotta go.
