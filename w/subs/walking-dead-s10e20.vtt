Twenty-eight, 29. I could be 50.
I don't know, man.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.423
I lost track a long time ago.

17:28.507 --> 17:31.051
-Can you just tell me how she's doing?
-Where are you from?

17:33.637 --> 17:36.431
-Where are you from?
-Where is she?

17:36.974 --> 17:38.308
Okay, fine.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.395
Where were you when the fall happened?

17:41.478 --> 17:43.605
Why is any of that important?

17:50.153 --> 17:51.321
Pittsburg.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.782
Can't you just tell me if she's alive?

17:53.866 --> 17:55.033
Why'd you come here?

17:55.534 --> 17:58.120
-She hurt her head pretty bad.
-You're avoiding the question.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.080
-She might have a concussion.
-She's fine.

18:01.415 --> 18:02.624
You don't believe me?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.334
I want to.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.004
Just let me see her.

18:08.672 --> 18:09.882
Tell me about her.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.509
What?

18:12.593 --> 18:14.595
Tell me about your friends.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.222
Start with the one you're worried about.
What her name?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.311
You won't tell me her name?

18:25.230 --> 18:26.356
Why is she here?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.862
The others, what are their names?

18:31.945 --> 18:33.822
Can't you ask them that?

18:33.906 --> 18:34.990
Tell me why they're here.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.662
Where are they from?

18:47.544 --> 18:48.587
Fine.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.130
-What do you want from me?
-We're done.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.007
-I gave you answers.
-Get her out of here.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.218
Why can't I see her?
What did you do with her?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.802
Why can't I see her?

18:55.886 --> 18:57.095
Because you're being a bitch.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.347
I want to see her!

19:02.476 --> 19:04.520
Then you should have
answered our questions.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.341
Yumiko.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.887
Yumiko, I'm so sorry.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.851
I tried to do like you said.

19:45.519 --> 19:49.314
I didn't tell them anything,
but maybe I still messed up.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.569
They kept grilling me,

19:53.652 --> 19:57.072
asking me up and down
what I knew about you guys.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.911
Like I'm some kind of narc.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.582
"Friends," they said.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.710
They used that word.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.005
(MEN SPEAKING)

20:50.250 --> 20:51.668
Eugene.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.716
(MEN SPEAKING)

21:26.828 --> 21:28.914
Shit! Shit!

21:30.374 --> 21:31.708
Shit!

21:34.127 --> 21:35.629
(THUDDING)

21:41.969 --> 21:43.011
What the...

21:43.095 --> 21:44.555
-Ezekiel?
-(SHUSHES)

21:53.397 --> 21:56.316
Took some epic maneuvering,
might have been spotted.

22:01.947 --> 22:05.492
-Sorry, I'm all wet.
-Oh, man, they got you, too.

22:05.576 --> 22:08.871
Yeah. Not the most fun interview
I've ever had.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.123
(MEN APPROACHING)

22:11.957 --> 22:12.958
MAN: Copy that.

22:15.419 --> 22:18.922
-Have any idea where the others are?
-They're gone. I don't know.

22:20.007 --> 22:22.676
We'll figure it out.
Let's get out of here.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.011
Right now?

22:24.094 --> 22:26.013
No, next week. Yes, right now.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.640
Yumiko's hurt.
I think they took her to help her.

22:28.724 --> 22:29.850
You think?

22:29.933 --> 22:31.685
Yeah, maybe. But...

22:31.768 --> 22:32.811
But what?

22:36.106 --> 22:37.232
Listen, uh...

22:38.108 --> 22:40.277
I didn't do us any favors in my interview.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.405
What did you do?

22:43.530 --> 22:47.618
Nothing. I mean, I got a little bit upset.

22:47.701 --> 22:48.869
I might have...

22:52.080 --> 22:54.875
The inquisition was aggressive.

22:57.461 --> 23:00.714
They are toying with us. Let's go.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.217
What's wrong?

23:03.300 --> 23:05.719
I don't think running will help right now.

23:05.802 --> 23:06.929
The guards will be back any minute.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.472
But what if they really
are helping Yumiko?

23:08.555 --> 23:10.224
Eugene said they would,
and you trust him, right?

23:10.307 --> 23:13.852
We don't know these people,
and we can't trust what we don't know.

23:13.936 --> 23:15.395
We can find a way out.

23:15.479 --> 23:16.647
You don't know that.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.065
I made it here, didn't I?

23:18.148 --> 23:20.526
-We'll be fine.
-Nothing is fine.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.830
Dickhead nailed me over an old fracture.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.293
Here, let me see.

23:45.634 --> 23:46.718
I'll be okay.

23:46.802 --> 23:49.471
It's healed fine every time before.

23:54.101 --> 23:57.187
No one is gonna hurt you anymore.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.565
Not while I'm here.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.903
-We'll keep watch up top.
-Ezekiel.

24:04.987 --> 24:06.864
Wait for the shift to change
and then we move.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.824
How are we supposed to find Eugene
and Yumiko?

24:08.907 --> 24:10.367
If we get some of their weapons,
we can even force them...

24:10.450 --> 24:11.660
We can't just leave them here.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.912
You don't think I know that?
They're my friends.

24:17.833 --> 24:19.168
I didn't mean it like that.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.921
I know they're your friends.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.965
You don't have to be an asshole about it.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.676
Don't act like I don't know
how to be friends with people, I do.

24:28.677 --> 24:30.262
I'm just trying to be helpful.

24:33.223 --> 24:35.017
Fear brings out the worst in us.

24:35.684 --> 24:37.102
As it just did in me.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.147
I apologize.

24:57.331 --> 24:59.875
What if Eugene trusted
the wrong people this time?

25:01.919 --> 25:04.004
People suck.

25:04.087 --> 25:06.256
They say one thing, but mean another.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.759
They tell you they love you.

25:08.842 --> 25:11.011
But they don't act like it.

25:12.930 --> 25:15.516
People are assholes.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.476
Especially family.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.145
Not all family.

25:20.229 --> 25:22.481
Most families.

25:29.154 --> 25:31.198
I just wanna do the right thing.

25:32.533 --> 25:33.575
I know.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.496
We need a better plan.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.665
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

25:39.748 --> 25:41.041
(DOOR OPENING)

25:46.922 --> 25:50.384
Hey, look, I'm sorry about before.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.596
I didn't mean to be difficult.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.975
This is all just a little scary.
You know what I'm saying?

25:58.058 --> 26:00.811
The questions, the guns, the whole getup.

26:00.894 --> 26:02.229
I mean, we rolled up, and it was just...

26:07.901 --> 26:09.403
What the hell did you just do?

26:25.210 --> 26:27.004
This is not what I meant.

26:28.547 --> 26:29.965
I'm sick of this place.

26:31.466 --> 26:35.596
Yeah, but now what are they gonna do
to us? To Yumiko? To Eugene?

26:35.679 --> 26:37.514
This is not a better plan.

26:37.598 --> 26:40.767
The opportunity presented itself,
so I took it.

26:40.851 --> 26:42.311
How the hell
are we supposed to explain this?

26:42.394 --> 26:43.520
Who cares?

26:47.441 --> 26:48.525
He's here now.

26:48.609 --> 26:50.152
And he has information we need.

26:53.155 --> 26:54.281
Keep quiet.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.034
Tell us what you did with our friends.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.160
You don't have to do this.

26:58.827 --> 27:01.622
Hey, hey, just let me do the talking.

27:04.625 --> 27:07.169
I just need to know
that my friend is okay.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.795
Okay.

27:08.879 --> 27:11.006
Your boss said she was getting help.
Is she?

27:11.089 --> 27:12.174
Why wouldn't she be?

27:12.257 --> 27:13.759
-Then tell me where she is.
-I don't know.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.260
She's probably with one of the medics.

27:15.344 --> 27:17.513
-We're supposed to believe that?
-You think we're hurting her?

27:17.930 --> 27:19.306
(SCOFFS)
The thought has crossed our minds.

27:20.891 --> 27:24.311
For the benefit of all,
and for all who seek solace at our gates.

27:24.394 --> 27:27.022
-What the hell is that supposed to mean?
-It's what we stand for.

27:27.105 --> 27:29.024
If your friend was sick,
then she got help.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.026
She's not sick,
you guys beat the crap out of her.

27:31.109 --> 27:32.444
I don't know anything about that.

27:32.528 --> 27:34.112
-Bullshit.
-Look, I know this is a lot,

27:34.196 --> 27:36.907
but isn't it possible, just maybe,
that we're not the bad guys.

27:36.990 --> 27:39.451
You separated us
and locked us inside trains.

27:39.535 --> 27:42.120
It's intense. I get that, okay?
But if you just stay calm,

27:43.455 --> 27:45.290
-we really can help you.
-How?

27:45.374 --> 27:48.335
Let's just say we have access to things
that are valuable in times like these.

27:48.418 --> 27:50.462
Food? Medicine? Ponies? What?

27:50.546 --> 27:53.090
I'm not saying yes, but I'm not saying no.
You know what I mean?

27:53.173 --> 27:54.800
We're organized.
You should let us help you.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.051
That's why you came, right?

27:57.803 --> 27:59.346
So let's say you're telling the truth,

27:59.429 --> 28:02.099
and you're actually very helpful people
who like to help,

28:02.182 --> 28:04.977
even if you look like a bunch
of scary action figures came to life.

28:06.144 --> 28:09.147
What happens after this?
What are you gonna do with us?

28:09.648 --> 28:10.691
I don't know.

28:10.774 --> 28:12.234
-He's lying.
-I don't know exactly...

28:12.317 --> 28:13.694
-You're messing with us.
-Are you messing with us?

28:13.777 --> 28:14.820
What would be the point of that?

28:14.903 --> 28:16.697
This is not our first time at the rodeo
with people like you.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.283
People do terrible shit
to each other all the time.

28:19.366 --> 28:22.578
I meant what I said,
what we stand for is real.

28:22.661 --> 28:24.955
This, all this, is just standard protocol

28:25.038 --> 28:26.456
on mission-based assignments.

28:26.540 --> 28:28.625
We have paperwork to fill out,
for Christ's sake.

28:28.709 --> 28:30.961
The place we live is a good place.

28:31.837 --> 28:35.841
It's our job to keep the many,
many good people who live there safe.

28:36.091 --> 28:38.260
We're careful
because we have a lot to lose.

28:38.343 --> 28:39.970
Don't you get that?

28:41.722 --> 28:43.223
I still need answers.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.933
Like a goodwill gesture.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.226
It's not hard.

28:46.476 --> 28:48.770
-Just tell me where my friend is.
-I can't do that.

28:48.854 --> 28:50.063
-See.
-Why not?

28:50.147 --> 28:51.190
Because I don't know.

28:51.273 --> 28:53.275
My orders were to keep you fed
until they were ready.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.401
-Ready?
-Ready for what?

28:54.484 --> 28:55.694
You don't get it. I'm just a grunt.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.362
I don't get the kind of intel
you want, all right?

28:57.446 --> 28:59.364
Three square meals and a uniform.
That's it. That's me.

28:59.448 --> 29:00.908
Hey, all right, you have to believe me.

29:00.991 --> 29:02.784
Look, I'm on probation as it is.

29:02.868 --> 29:05.329
They're gonna discharge me for this,
getting snatched up by some chick.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.289
Maybe we need to start
breaking some fingers.

29:07.372 --> 29:08.415
I'm just a rookie.

29:08.498 --> 29:10.459
I'm so new, that rifle isn't even loaded.

29:18.926 --> 29:20.219
Ezekiel, stop!

29:20.969 --> 29:22.054
Stop.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.390
JUANITA: Oh, my God! Stop! Stop!

29:27.893 --> 29:29.186
You're gonna kill him!

29:31.146 --> 29:33.524
Stop! Stop! Stop it, Ezekiel!

29:35.359 --> 29:36.985
No one's gonna hurt me anymore!

29:37.069 --> 29:39.112
Don't! You're gonna kill him! Don't!

29:41.281 --> 29:42.407
Just listen!

29:43.742 --> 29:46.245
Just listen and do what we say!

29:47.454 --> 29:48.497
Please.

29:53.752 --> 29:54.795
Please.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.398
YUMIKO: <i>Just do what they say.</i>

30:16.650 --> 30:18.819
DR. PORTER: <i>Do not make things worse.</i>

30:19.570 --> 30:22.447
EZEKIEL: <i>No one is going to</i>
<i>hurt you anymore.</i>

30:58.859 --> 30:59.985
Shit.

31:10.746 --> 31:12.998
What is the matter with you?

31:13.081 --> 31:14.333
Just go.

31:25.511 --> 31:27.012
MAN: Come on.

31:28.263 --> 31:32.351
Ooh, girl. Get your shit together.

31:32.601 --> 31:35.062
Don't be so hard on yourself.

31:38.815 --> 31:41.360
This is new. I get it.

31:42.277 --> 31:44.446
But time waits for no one.

31:44.530 --> 31:46.532
We start dying the day we're born.

31:49.826 --> 31:51.870
So, <i>vámonos.</i>

31:53.205 --> 31:54.456
I don't think I can.

31:54.790 --> 31:56.250
You can.

31:56.333 --> 31:57.459
What about them?

31:57.543 --> 31:59.002
-What about them?
-They're my friends.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.421
You met them a week ago.

32:02.130 --> 32:05.092
That's a lifetime in apocalypse years.

32:05.175 --> 32:07.761
Haven't you learned
to trust your instincts by now?

32:07.845 --> 32:09.304
You know better than that.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.223
Yeah?

32:12.766 --> 32:13.892
But...

32:19.773 --> 32:21.108
You're good on your own.

32:21.191 --> 32:23.110
I'm a goddamn superhero on my own.

32:23.610 --> 32:25.404
So let's go.

32:25.487 --> 32:26.697
You wanna go.

32:30.242 --> 32:31.702
Believe me, I know.

32:34.621 --> 32:36.081
But if I leave...

32:36.623 --> 32:38.750
-It makes me just like her, don't it?
-Yeah.

32:39.877 --> 32:41.170
It makes you just like Mom.

32:41.712 --> 32:43.714
-She was a survivor.
-She was a monster.

32:45.215 --> 32:46.800
But there are always monsters.

32:46.884 --> 32:48.427
She was scared.

32:48.510 --> 32:50.512
Everybody gets scared sometimes.

32:50.596 --> 32:52.264
You remember what it was like?

32:53.473 --> 32:55.142
We had to learn our lessons the hard way.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.479
Take your freedom.

33:01.190 --> 33:02.941
Wait, but there were some
good ones, though.

33:03.025 --> 33:06.695
Maybe not Mom or Dougie,

33:06.778 --> 33:08.447
but not everyone was bad.

33:08.530 --> 33:11.200
There was Miss Travis,

33:12.993 --> 33:14.912
Sammy and his people...

33:16.622 --> 33:17.706
And them.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.294
There are the stories you tell yourself...

33:24.254 --> 33:25.589
And then there's the truth.

33:30.010 --> 33:31.053
Maybe.

33:36.892 --> 33:38.560
But they came back for me.

34:03.001 --> 34:05.254
I don't know my own strength sometimes.

34:06.713 --> 34:08.966
-Who you talking to now?
-No one.

34:09.883 --> 34:11.301
I mean, you.

34:14.346 --> 34:16.682
I'm not crazy,
if that's what you're thinking.

34:17.766 --> 34:20.978
I mean, there's the ADHD,
the anxiety, the PTSD,

34:21.061 --> 34:22.646
the depression, the crushing loneliness,

34:22.729 --> 34:26.942
and the active imagination that
helps me cope with all of that,

34:27.025 --> 34:31.363
but like, maybe that's the only
sane response to an insane world.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.240
You know what I'm saying?

34:39.079 --> 34:45.169
Small, dark spaces just do bad things
to my head because...

34:48.297 --> 34:50.716
Well, I don't like them,
but who does, right?

34:50.799 --> 34:52.342
So screw you for judging.

34:53.343 --> 34:55.095
I didn't say anything.

34:58.515 --> 35:01.685
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
mess anything else up here.

35:02.060 --> 35:03.145
You mind putting that down?

35:04.354 --> 35:06.607
I'm going to hold onto it
just a little longer,

35:06.690 --> 35:08.066
if it's all the same to you.

35:10.194 --> 35:11.403
Can you at least...

35:37.095 --> 35:38.222
What?

35:41.058 --> 35:43.435
Nothing. The splinter came out.

35:54.029 --> 35:55.948
Thanks for not screaming.

35:56.031 --> 35:59.201
Yeah, well, this doesn't exactly
look good for me.

36:00.077 --> 36:01.828
You really gonna get busted for this, huh?

36:05.123 --> 36:06.708
It'll be worse for you.

36:10.045 --> 36:11.672
You're gonna have to explain this.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.131
I'll figure it out.

36:14.258 --> 36:15.467
Hand me the rifle.

36:18.762 --> 36:20.514
-I can tell them that sometimes...
-They won't care.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.766
-I have this tic that...
-They won't care.

36:22.850 --> 36:25.143
Maybe you can explain to them
that you slipped.

36:25.227 --> 36:29.147
No, no, no. I screwed up.
I have to face the consequences, okay?

36:29.231 --> 36:31.191
And you and your friends,
God bless you, good luck.

36:31.275 --> 36:34.111
You have to go back to whatever
shitty corner of the world you came from.

36:34.194 --> 36:36.363
There's got to be a way
we can help each other out.

36:40.784 --> 36:42.160
I'm listening.

36:42.786 --> 36:44.872
What if I answer your boss's questions?

36:50.085 --> 36:51.420
I can work with that.

36:53.172 --> 36:55.757
-Would I be able to see my friends?
-It's not my call.

36:55.841 --> 36:57.801
But you heard my boss.
You answer, you see them.

36:57.885 --> 36:58.969
You can believe him or not.

37:01.054 --> 37:02.890
(COMM BEEPS)

37:07.186 --> 37:08.896
Fine. Uh...

37:09.688 --> 37:13.942
I just met them,
so I don't know how old they are.

37:14.568 --> 37:17.154
But who cares?
If you're alive in the apocalypse,

37:17.237 --> 37:19.948
you're, like, 150 years old anyway.

37:20.699 --> 37:22.492
I don't know where they're from.

37:22.576 --> 37:25.704
Nowhere and everywhere, probably,
just like everyone else.

37:26.663 --> 37:30.709
I'm from Pittsburg, by way of San Juan.

37:31.210 --> 37:35.297
But do cities and states and countries
even exist or matter anymore?

37:36.173 --> 37:37.799
We've been on the road for a week.

37:38.550 --> 37:41.720
We had bikes for a while. Then we walked.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.222
That's how we got here.

37:44.139 --> 37:45.474
Why am I here?

37:45.933 --> 37:48.060
To be with them and...

37:48.143 --> 37:53.023
Their names are Eugene,
Yumiko and Ezekiel.

37:53.774 --> 37:55.275
But you already knew that.

37:55.359 --> 37:58.278
And my name is Princess.

37:59.863 --> 38:01.782
That was good. Thank you.

38:02.449 --> 38:03.784
The rifle.

38:21.218 --> 38:22.302
See...

38:23.303 --> 38:24.596
Didn't have to be hard.

38:25.556 --> 38:27.683
The rules are simple,
the questions are routine.

38:28.559 --> 38:30.102
People just complicate them.

38:31.353 --> 38:33.605
Just needed to know
you could play ball with us.

38:38.902 --> 38:42.489
So when can I see my friends?

38:44.408 --> 38:45.450
Right now.

38:46.118 --> 38:47.202
I got it. Let's go!

38:51.415 --> 38:52.416
Wait!

38:55.752 --> 38:57.754
