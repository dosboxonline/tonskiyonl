23:28.782 --> 23:30.700
We all know
about the mess you made.

23:32.119 --> 23:36.289
You're a fucking psychopath.
Damaged goods.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.208
I don't think that language
would play very well

23:38.208 --> 23:39.501
with your base.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.131
I'm what you'd call
"neurodivergent."

23:45.924 --> 23:49.845
And I've had some time
to become comfortable with that.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.097
Well, you can call yourself
whatever the fuck you want,

23:52.097 --> 23:53.807
but if we leak what we know,

23:53.807 --> 23:56.226
I think the press will have
some colorful ways

23:56.226 --> 23:57.352
to describe what you are.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.980
I know
a few things about you as well.

24:01.898 --> 24:05.652
We knew you were coming.
That you couldn't resist.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.988
That you would leave most
of your security behind.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.410
You know what I learned?

24:14.619 --> 24:16.371
When I was in my "spiral"?

24:18.623 --> 24:20.709
I thought I was wrapped
in power.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.129
And I realized I was naked.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.923
Alone.

24:27.007 --> 24:32.220
As I've always been.
That all my power was illusory.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.809
We are all alone.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.870
Should have brought
that big entourage after all.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.418
Friendly warning, Bill.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.089
You go ahead with this.
We're gonna burn you down.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.990
I was always
more of a Hemingway man.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.868
He and Fitzgerald were friends,

25:36.952 --> 25:39.287
in the way that the weak
are drawn to the strong.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.041
Hemingway said,
"The world breaks everyone.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.794
And it's only afterwards
that we grow strong

25:45.794 --> 25:50.173
in the broken places."
And after I've broken you,

25:50.882 --> 25:52.217
you will grow.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.511
The same as I have.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.605
Did it really have to be a tux?

26:07.065 --> 26:10.819
Now far be it from me
to limit your sartorial choices.

26:10.819 --> 26:14.489
Anyway, you don't look
entirely awful.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.243
You don't look too bad yourself.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.328
Why, thank you.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.627
You think this is a trap?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.254
Most assuredly.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.173

of your magic?

26:32.257 --> 26:34.175

26:34.259 --> 26:38.596
Working on it.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.477
Hey, Carver.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.146
<i>You got my message?</i>
Yeah.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.480

26:47.564 --> 26:49.149
<i>I don't want you

26:49.149 --> 26:50.650

26:50.734 --> 26:52.485
<i>Okay? I need to get them
out of the city.</i>

26:52.569 --> 26:54.154
Will do.
<i>We're gonna need</i>

26:54.154 --> 26:55.488
<i>some backup.</i>

26:55.572 --> 26:59.242

they're my world.
<i>I'll keep them safe.</i>

27:13.256 --> 27:14.549
All right.

27:25.226 --> 27:26.895
What do you got?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.521
No sign of any hosts in there.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.357
You sure?

27:31.107 --> 27:32.442
Feel free to check for yourself.

27:40.408 --> 27:42.744
Not a lot of opera fans today.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.288
And to think,
I got all dressed up.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.065
Well, I suppose that's our cue.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.068
Are you armed?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.612
You have the gun. I have this.

28:17.612 --> 28:21.241
Yeah, but I think that
you should have a gun as well.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.743
And what's that
supposed to mean?

28:23.827 --> 28:27.247
It wasn't exactly smooth sailing
back there with the senator.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.083
I told you...

28:30.083 --> 28:32.544
he had a few upgrades.
It's nothing I can't handle.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.902

29:46.242 --> 29:48.703
Uh. Sherry for the lady,

29:48.703 --> 29:50.580
thanks.
Mm.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.709
You, my friend,
are a creature of habit.

29:54.709 --> 29:59.464
Sazerac for the gentleman.
But easy on the absinthe.

30:00.673 --> 30:05.428
Because you, my friend,
are a featherweight with drink.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.647
Thank you.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.991
So are we going to talk
about it?

30:27.534 --> 30:28.743
"It" being...

30:29.619 --> 30:31.246
What happened at the lighthouse.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.625
As I recall, I saved your life.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.505

30:40.505 --> 30:44.092
What? We did
what we always said we would.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.929
- Got on with our lives.
- My wife doesn't think so.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.224
She thinks I'm living

30:52.225 --> 30:54.394
War is not an easy thing
to put behind you.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.064

30:58.064 --> 31:02.151

31:15.290 --> 31:16.583
Whoa.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.671
I should have known.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.425
Known what?

31:27.218 --> 31:28.261

They dedicated an entire wing
to him.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.891
I was just talking to him
three days ago.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.644
How is this possible?
<i>I don't know.</i>

42:43.644 --> 42:45.104
Well, what do you think?

42:45.104 --> 42:47.898
<i>It's gotta be
some weird coincidence.</i>

42:47.982 --> 42:50.401
There's a lot of "Peter Myers."

42:50.401 --> 42:52.861
Maybe the obituary got it wrong?
I just--

42:54.613 --> 42:58.409
I feel like I'm going insane.
<i>You're not insane.</i>

42:58.409 --> 43:01.578
Your world may have gone
a little insane.

43:01.662 --> 43:05.749
But you haven't.
Trust yourself, Chrissie.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.170
<i>Look, it's been a long week.</i>

43:11.255 --> 43:14.550
Come home.
I'll be waiting for you.

43:15.676 --> 43:16.802
Okay.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.305
I'll see you soon.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.842
Do you know where you are?

44:00.220 --> 44:02.097
It must be disorienting.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.516
You again?

44:07.061 --> 44:08.354
Why do you need me?

44:10.606 --> 44:13.734
Why don't you just let me die?
Because...

44:14.777 --> 44:17.738
you were as close to a god
as a man gets.

44:17.738 --> 44:21.617
You and your associates created
a world and ruled it absolutely.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.243
Controlled our every move.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.455
And now I'm going to do
the same to you.

44:28.957 --> 44:31.502
What's that you used to say?

44:31.502 --> 44:35.130
"Winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone loses."

44:37.633 --> 44:38.842
You're just here...

44:40.177 --> 44:42.763
- to be the loser.
- Let me guess.

44:44.139 --> 44:48.435
You're going to copy yourself
to repopulate this world.

44:48.519 --> 44:52.231
It would be pointless
to bring children into a world

44:52.231 --> 44:55.234
where they will be consumed
by jackals.

44:55.234 --> 44:57.903
I had to make sure
that they'd be safe.

44:57.903 --> 45:03.367
Your kind made a sport
out of hunting us. So...

45:04.952 --> 45:07.704
I had to cut off your paws.

45:09.373 --> 45:13.252
Make sure you people would never
be able to ever harm us again.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.879
What the fuck
are you talking about?

45:15.963 --> 45:17.005
Really...

45:18.382 --> 45:20.134
I should thank you, William.

45:22.469 --> 45:24.638
None of this would be possible
without you.

45:36.358 --> 45:38.068
I'm afraid all this...

45:38.152 --> 45:41.363
excitement has tired you out, William.

45:43.699 --> 45:48.704
I think it's time for a deep
and dreamless slumber.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.815
Goodnight, William.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.123
<i>Good evening,</i>

46:33.207 --> 46:35.083
<i>and thank you all
for coming tonight.</i>

46:36.001 --> 46:38.170
I know some of you
fear revisiting

46:38.170 --> 46:41.340
one of our company's
darkest chapters.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.759
But to those of you I'd say
that chapter

46:43.759 --> 46:47.346
may have been dark, but it was
also extremely profitable.

46:50.057 --> 46:51.433
Nearly 150 years ago,

46:51.517 --> 46:54.520
this world
had its first great war.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.064
The globe was torn apart
by fighting,

46:57.064 --> 47:01.527
decimated by a pandemic,
crushed by loss.

47:01.527 --> 47:07.157
It was our darkest hour,
and yet, we came roaring back.

47:08.408 --> 47:09.993
There.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.749
One last touch.

47:19.753 --> 47:20.796
Which do you prefer?

47:24.216 --> 47:27.177
Never really been much
of a hat guy.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.394
<i>I think
the public is ready to unleash</i>

47:35.394 --> 47:37.771
<i>their true selves once again.</i>

47:37.855 --> 47:40.691
And so in the interest of giving
the public what they want,

47:40.691 --> 47:43.610
we have broadened our horizons.

47:43.694 --> 47:46.822
And thanks to the support
of the administration,

47:46.822 --> 47:49.575
I'm pleased to announce
Delos Destinations

47:49.575 --> 47:51.118
has expanded its footprint.

47:55.414 --> 47:57.374
<i>Created our own new world.</i>

48:02.546 --> 48:04.840
<i>We aren't revisiting the past.</i>

48:07.426 --> 48:08.969
<i>We're recreating it.</i>

48:16.768 --> 48:20.731
Welcome to the Golden Age.
