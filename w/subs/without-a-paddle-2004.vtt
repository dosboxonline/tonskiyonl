-Ghostbusters!
-Ghostbusters!

02:27.523 --> 02:29.232
Yeah!

02:29.608 --> 02:30.900
We did it, man!

02:32.986 --> 02:35.655
-Be safe.
-You got it, man.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.365
-Have a great trip.
-Yeah.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.659
When I'm done with probation,
I'm gonna come find you.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.577
I know you will.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.540
All right, I'm out of here.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.085
One last thing.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.546
-Remember this?
-My Indy compass.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.589
-In case you get lost.
-Where'd you get this?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.591
-And you will get lost.
-Yeah, I will get lost.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.968
But it's half the fun.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.970
-Thanks, man.
-Be good.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.890
-Take care of those two fools.
-Have fun.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.851
I will.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.936
Catch you around, boys!

03:09.815 --> 03:11.816
Bye, Billy!

03:14.653 --> 03:16.404
I wonder where he's gonna end up.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.698
He's gonna do great things.

03:18.782 --> 03:22.159
Don't worry.
We're all gonna do great things.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.375
-Are you ready for Tom?
-I'm ready for Tom!

03:29.960 --> 03:32.169
-Let's ride!
-Come on, baby!

03:34.089 --> 03:35.256
Yeah!

03:36.675 --> 03:39.218
Angie! What was that?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.554
Shit. I think it's Tony.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.972
-Tony?
-Get your clothes on!

03:43.056 --> 03:47.018
-What happened to "Tony's in China"?
-This is bad. Get your clothes on...

03:48.687 --> 03:50.271
Hey, Tony.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.857
You're home early, baby.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.651
-Tony?
-What the hell's going on here?

03:58.113 --> 04:00.781
Tony, there's enough of me
to go around.

04:00.866 --> 04:04.285
I'm thinking about a Tom sandwich.
Light on the Tom.

04:08.248 --> 04:14.045
Jerry here has the reworked formula,
so I'll pass the ball on to him.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.671
You're on.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.511
-Now?
-Now.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.015
Right.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.741
Baby! You're home.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.284
Hey.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.455
How was the surf?

04:49.539 --> 04:51.248
Someone's happy to see me.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.502
Well, why wouldn't I be?
Especially tonight.

04:55.754 --> 04:56.963
Wow.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.048
You outdid yourself.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.760
Just seemed like the right night
to outdo oneself, so...

05:03.553 --> 05:05.471
A Thursday?

05:05.555 --> 05:08.474
Honey, don't you think
every night should be special?

05:08.558 --> 05:12.019
Yeah. Yes, every night
should be special, this is true.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.646
But, really,

05:13.730 --> 05:17.984
specifically, there's always one night
a year that just seems right

05:18.068 --> 05:21.070
for a celebration of a specific event.

05:21.947 --> 05:25.324
-Do you know what I'm saying?
-Absolutely.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.993
I love dip.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.619
It's our anniversary!

05:28.704 --> 05:32.581
Our first date!
How many hints do I need to give you?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.210
I must be crazy.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.672
A trip? Great call. Where we going?

05:39.756 --> 05:43.175
I won't do it. I won't play the role
of nagging girlfriend anymore.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.928
Would nagging wife make you happier?

05:48.807 --> 05:52.018
Please tell me that was not
you proposing to me.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.689
Jerry and Denise cannot get
to the phone right now,

05:56.773 --> 05:58.774
because we're doing it!

05:59.568 --> 06:02.319
Jerry, it's Mom.
If you're there, will you please pick up?

06:02.404 --> 06:05.239
Hey, Mom. I can't really talk right now.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.285
What?

06:24.134 --> 06:25.760
Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:25.844 --> 06:29.847
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.
You're in my spot.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.683
I don't see your name on it.

06:32.768 --> 06:36.020
Well, actually, yes, my name is on it.
See? Right there, Dr. Mott.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.272
That's me. That's my space.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.399
You got me.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.152
But look at this, pal!

06:43.236 --> 06:46.322
Now, your name's not on it!

06:46.406 --> 06:47.656
Hey! What're you doing? Hey! Hey!

06:47.741 --> 06:51.660
Hey, you get back. You get back.
I'm not afraid to use this!

06:51.745 --> 06:53.287
Hey, don't!

06:54.915 --> 06:57.917
-Have a good day, Doc.
-You, too.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.555
I'm Dr. Mott!

07:23.110 --> 07:25.402
Good morning, Sandi. TGIF.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.154
What's that, Dr. Mott?

07:27.239 --> 07:29.824
Thank goodness it's Friday.
Happy Friday.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.034
It's the weekend. Hurray.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.870
Right.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.376
"TGIF."

07:41.128 --> 07:44.130
That was great. So smart.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.092
Why don't you just ask her out,
you dumbass?

07:48.552 --> 07:49.718
It's Jerry Conlaine.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.555
-He says it's very important.
-Okay.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.308
-Hey, Jerry, how you doing? Long time.
-Hey, Dan.

07:59.062 --> 08:02.940
Listen. There was an accident.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.276
Billy's dead.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.363
-You're kidding.
-Yeah, he...

08:10.073 --> 08:11.991
He was para-surfing
down in Costa Rica.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.620
So the funeral's this weekend.
It's... It's in Oregon.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.665
-Yeah...
-I'm flying out in a couple of hours.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.751
-Can you make it?
-Yeah, I'll be there.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.851
Dano! Hey.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.312
-Hey, Jerry.
-How's it going?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.688
Man.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.610
Oh, my God, is that Everest?

08:47.694 --> 08:50.779
Yeah. You know Billy.
He wasn't afraid of anything.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.823
He did it all.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.950
Did you know he ran with the bulls?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.535
He sent me a postcard from Spain.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.871
-Man, he did great things.
-He did.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.706
I still want you.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.543
Why did you leave me?

09:04.628 --> 09:06.253
Billy.

09:06.338 --> 09:10.216
Billy's dead and he's still got a better
chance of getting laid than I do.

09:12.552 --> 09:17.306
"Leadeth me in paths of righteousness
for his name's sake.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.184
"I walk through the valley
of the shadow..."

09:20.268 --> 09:21.310
What is that?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.686
Tom's here.

09:22.771 --> 09:26.315
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear..."

09:34.991 --> 09:37.117
Is this Billy's funeral?

09:38.662 --> 09:41.330
Is that the corpse of Billy Newwood?

09:42.374 --> 09:44.208
Jer, is that you?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.921
You're with Dan?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.548
-Where did you guys park?
-Tom!

09:53.218 --> 09:54.635
Okay. Sorry.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.013
There was a hell of a fender-bender
coming in, and...

09:58.098 --> 09:59.598
-Please continue.
-I-5 was a parking lot.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.016
-I'm so sorry.
-Anyway, I made it.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.269
"Then the earth shook and trembled."

10:03.353 --> 10:04.311
Sorry, Padre.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.521
"The foundations moved
and were shaken..."

10:05.605 --> 10:06.897
My bad. Missed an exit.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.899
"...because he was wroth.

10:09.859 --> 10:16.031
"He bowed the heavens also,
and came down: and darkness was..."

10:17.617 --> 10:19.994
Did you notice how many hot chicks
were at that funeral?

10:20.078 --> 10:24.039
No kidding! It was like a discotheque
with a coffin in the middle.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.750
-Look at that.
-Holy...

10:26.835 --> 10:28.961
Fort Cooper. Can you believe it?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.838
God, I remember it being taller.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.131
Wow.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.970
There it is.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.556
Race you to the top!

10:47.230 --> 10:48.814
-Dano, come on up, buddy!
-Come on, Dan.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.567
You guys are hammered!
I'm not climbing up a 20-year-old rope.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.319
-That's crazy.
-Tommy, catch.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.905
This whole thing seems
a little insane for us to be doing,

10:56.990 --> 10:59.575
climbing with the possibility of...

11:02.704 --> 11:05.331
-You all right, Dano?
-Come on, Dano, grab it.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.416
-Give me the rope.
-Come on, Dan!

11:08.460 --> 11:11.045
Use your tippy-toes. There you go.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.130
Cobweb. Look out.

11:15.633 --> 11:19.136
-Oh, my God.
-How small is that door?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.596
Kind of seems about the same, actually.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.141
I hope I don't fall through
the floor of this thing.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.019
Hey! What's up, B.A. Baracus?

11:27.103 --> 11:29.688
Mr. T. How awesome is that?

11:29.773 --> 11:32.900
You guys. Oh, my gosh.

11:33.985 --> 11:37.196
-Look at this.
-Hey, that's our old flag.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.116
-D.B. Cooper's treasure chest.
-Man, look at that thing.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.369
-You remember this?
-Of course, yeah.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.372
Cooper parachuted out of a plane
up north with a bunch of stolen cash.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.790
Gosh, we were obsessed with that.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.541
-Nationwide police hunt and...
-Right.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.710
-He was never found.
-Yeah, we were gonna sneak away,

11:51.795 --> 11:54.880
go up the river, all Huck Finn,
Apocalypse Now style.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.924
Get the loot.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.426
I bet you we spent half our childhood
planning that trip.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.178
It's all Billy ever talked about.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.722
-Let's open it up.
-We have to break the lock.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.308
-I'll break it.
-38-24-36.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.436
-How do you know that?
-How do you possibly remember that?

12:09.521 --> 12:14.400
Miss 1981, Julie McDonald.
38-24-36. Unforgettable.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.402
Had a passion for cycling. Disliked liars.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.028
You're right.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.073
-What the...
-Do you believe it?

12:21.157 --> 12:22.574
Man! Look at that.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.410
The oath.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.413
"We swear that these things
will remain in this box

12:27.497 --> 12:30.332
"until we find D.B. Cooper's treasure."

12:30.917 --> 12:33.252
Signed, a bunch of kids.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.171
Remember we pricked our fingers,
took a blood oath?

12:36.256 --> 12:39.299
Dan, what's that next to your signature?
That's not blood.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.219
It was earwax. I was afraid of needles.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.223
Should we check out the priceless
treasures of our youth?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.142
-C-3PO.
-C-3PO.

12:48.643 --> 12:49.852
I wonder who put that in.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.562
Let me see that.
That's a collectible now.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.398
-Yeah, right.
-My Brian Bosworth rookie card.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.150
-The Boz.
-Man, I thought he was gonna be

12:56.234 --> 12:57.901
the greatest ever.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.237
"I've been in that box a very long time."

13:00.321 --> 13:02.656
Well, you're free now.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.784
And, Tom, I believe
this is your contribution.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.619
Oh, my God.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.832
That's my first rubber. Boy.

13:11.916 --> 13:16.253
I found this in my dad's pickup
right before he went to jail.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.630
I remember he caught me with it.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.133
Boy, he smacked me right in the head.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.427
What a charming father-and-son tale.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.012
He was funny.

13:25.096 --> 13:28.807
-Hey, what did Billy put in there?
-Yeah, what does he got?

13:28.892 --> 13:30.684
His Indy compass.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.687
I gave this to him before he took off
on his trip. He must've...

13:33.771 --> 13:35.105
I don't know, he must've put it back.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.984
Look at this. It's one of our mix tapes.
Remember we did the DJ intros?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.736
Yeah, let's not Wang Chung tonight.
Burn that.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.655
Wow. You guys, check out this map.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.492
-Looks like Billy left us a treasure map.
-Look at that.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.660
-Not only that...
-This map looks new.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.704
He plotted out the whole trip.

13:50.788 --> 13:54.750
Billy thought D.B. landed right here.
There's no way he did this as a kid.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.003
He must've been adding to the box
over the years.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.798
This is the camping trip
he wanted us to take last summer.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.843
I... I couldn't go.
I was detained in Mexico.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.888
And he wouldn't do it
unless we were all together.

14:07.972 --> 14:12.643
I swear to God, I think he figured it out.
I mean, look at all this research.

14:12.727 --> 14:16.480
He reconstructed the jump.
He pinpointed D.B.'s landing.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.023
That's crazy.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.110
My God.

14:22.195 --> 14:26.490
I'm sorry, you guys, we made an oath.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.159
It all goes back in the box.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.162
It all goes back in the box
until we find the treasure.

14:32.247 --> 14:36.750
So let's go find it.
Let's... Let's take Billy's trip.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.087
-Come on, guys, what do you say?
-I say, "Hell, yes."

14:40.171 --> 14:42.214
-Hell, yes! Right?
-We'll get a canoe.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.549
-Right?
-No.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.385
No. No, I'm...

14:46.469 --> 14:48.095
-No.
-We're all going.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.430
-Listen, I wanna get a lot of rope.
-A rope's good.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.100
All right, I know you guys won't grasp
this concept,

14:53.184 --> 14:55.394
but I have patients and...

14:55.478 --> 14:56.520
Yeah, yeah. I have a Rambo knife.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.730
I am a doctor now.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.066
I am Dr. Mott now!

15:02.151 --> 15:04.820
I have responsibilities.

15:06.906 --> 15:11.660
Your responsibility is to come
treasure hunting with us.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.580
We're 30.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.790
I mean, this might be the last chance
we have to do something

15:16.874 --> 15:19.084
incredibly stupid together.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.629
I agree.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.674
For Billy, Dano.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.220
-Not fair.
-I think it's fair.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.638
All right.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.308
Time to re-up on our oath, boys.
Fingers up.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.435
-Hey, put that away. Tom...
-I love the way you work.

15:36.519 --> 15:40.689
-You know who I'm talking to.
-There's no way I'm going. No chance!

15:41.190 --> 15:44.234
No! You guys, no! Hey. Let go of me!

15:44.319 --> 15:45.444
Hey! No, no.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.862
No!

15:49.282 --> 15:50.907
I hate you guys.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.285
We hate you, too,
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.162
Hey! Hey! I agreed to come.
You said I could drive.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.080
We drive by my rules. No kissing me.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.208
I cannot believe that Billy kept the Duke
in running shape all these years.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.294
318 V8, man. They're bullet proof.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.172
How about a little Fort Cooper classic?

16:05.715 --> 16:08.425
This is Rocking Billy Newwood.
I'm here with fellow DJ's.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.510
-Jazzy Jerry.
-Yeah!

16:10.595 --> 16:11.678
Gonzo Tommy.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.263
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

16:13.348 --> 16:15.932
-And Disco Dan.
-Burn, baby, burn!

16:16.017 --> 16:19.269
And we have a special dedication
by Dan's mom, entitled,

16:19.354 --> 16:21.313
"I've had sex with Tom."

16:21.397 --> 16:23.440
I totally did, though.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.450
And usually, it's too late when you

16:33.534 --> 16:34.660
Do you know the words?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.870
Realize what you have

16:37.997 --> 16:41.750
And my mind goes back
To a girl I left

16:41.834 --> 16:43.710
Some years ago

16:43.795 --> 16:45.837
Who told me

16:45.922 --> 16:49.675
Just hold on loosely

16:49.759 --> 16:52.260
But don't let go

16:52.929 --> 16:57.099
The boys together, the open road.
Good tunes, good times.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.518
Good God!
Let's pull off memory highway.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.770
...always on
Till the break of dawn

17:01.938 --> 17:04.856
C-O-M-P-T-O-N
And the city they call Long Beach

17:04.941 --> 17:06.191
Putting that shit together

17:06.275 --> 17:08.609
And if it's good enough
To take 'em off a proper chunk

17:08.694 --> 17:10.862
I'll take a small piece
of some of that funky stuff

17:10.946 --> 17:12.864
-It's like this and like that...
-...like that...

17:12.949 --> 17:16.034
-How do you know all these words?
-He's a doctor.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.912
Doctors study other doctors' work.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.248
-You're a secret Dr. Dre fan.
-God.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.790
-It's like this and like that
-Like this

17:22.875 --> 17:25.460
-and like that...
-...and like that...

17:30.675 --> 17:34.678
-Well, this is a metropolis. Look at this.
-This place is very remote.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.431
I wish I would've brought my dancing
shoes so we could go clubbing.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.391
Maybe we should find out
where the nearest hospital is.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.768
Let's stay at The Ritz. This is great.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.023
-How are you?
-Hi.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.367
Where are we?

17:57.452 --> 18:01.538
Corner of Bumfuck and
You Got a Purty Mouth.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.582
Hey, I'm gonna make a call.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.334
Wait, Jerry, you should
use my new cell phone.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.670
It's a satellite phone,
so it works everywhere.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.381
And it's got a camera and it's got
an address book and, listen,

18:11.466 --> 18:13.550
-it's even got a personalized ring.
-Nice.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.511
You shouldn't be proud of that, Dan.

18:16.721 --> 18:17.804
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.264
Well,

18:19.474 --> 18:22.267
I'm gonna go check out
the canoe situation.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.353
-You want anything?
-Good luck. No, I'm good.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.440
Hello?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.859
Denise. What are you doing home?
Hey.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.236
Hi. Is everything all right?

18:33.696 --> 18:35.030
You know.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.699
-It's as good as it can be.
-Where are you?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.286
On the road.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.580
Good. You're on your way home.
What time do you get in?

18:43.664 --> 18:44.706
I can't wait to see you.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.541
What you looking at, boy?

18:47.210 --> 18:51.129
Here's the thing, the guys and I...
We're going on a treasure hunt.

18:51.214 --> 18:55.008
And I know that sounds dumb,
but it's something that we have to do

18:55.092 --> 18:56.092
for Billy.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.304
That doesn't sound dumb at all.
I completely understand.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.599
-You do?
-Just call me when you get a chance.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.811
But I might be out of the house for a bit.
Yeah, because

19:05.895 --> 19:09.231
my girlfriends and I, we're gonna go
on a search for the lost city of Atlantis.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.067
Maybe my treasure will help
buy your submarine.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.319
-Maybe. Maybe it will.
-Take a picture.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.779
-Hold on.
-I'm on the little guy's back.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.031
-Shut up.
-Go, take a picture.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.199
That's good. That's good.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.911
Hello?

19:24.789 --> 19:27.249
That did not sound like it went well.

19:27.917 --> 19:32.671
Hiya, boys. Nice day.
Just passing through?

19:33.923 --> 19:36.925
No. We're actually from UPS.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.178
Looks like someone ordered
a set of teeth.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.932
-I beg your pardon?
-Taser guns. Dropping them off.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.686
-Anyways...
-So, help me out here, boys.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.479
Where was it you said you was headed?

19:49.564 --> 19:52.566
We're just taking a trip. Our old friend,
Billy, he made this map...

19:52.650 --> 19:54.568
Quiet time. Quiet.

19:54.652 --> 19:59.489
We're just taking a day trip
up Spirit River, Your Honour.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.491
Pretty thick country up there.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.869
You make a couple mistakes up there,
you gone.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.538
You know what, I think we'll be okay.
I was a Boy Scout.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.540
Tom, you were a Boy Scout,
weren't you?

20:08.624 --> 20:11.084
No. But I ate a Brownie once.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.089
You don't wanna play
on the big river, boys.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.634
-Oh, no, we're not playing, we're...
-I got this. You listen to me.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.720
I know a thing or two about rapid-riding

20:21.804 --> 20:24.890
'cause I was a white-water guide
in Northern California, NoCal.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.393
Here's the thing. I know how to read
a river better than you can read a book.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.186
-Just a little better.
-All right.

20:30.271 --> 20:33.064
-All right. So we're gonna get going?
-That's right.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.318
-Yeah? Thank you, Sheriff.
-See you, Ray-Bans.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.628
You think we got enough booze, Tom?

20:54.712 --> 20:57.756
Maybe you wanna hire a bartender
to come on the trip with us.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.592
What's a camping trip without beer?

21:00.676 --> 21:04.095
Well, it's still a camping trip, actually,
just with less vomiting.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.056
I hear you're a river guide.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.724
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.768
Class IV, V?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.271
-Which is it?
-Why don't you try putting

21:13.356 --> 21:15.774
those numbers together? That's right.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.944
I've shot a class 45,
and I've never lost a man.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.363
Lie to me. I don't care.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.907
I'm not the one that's going to drown.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.160
All right, fellas. Here we go. Attention.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.623
We christen you Duke II.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.545
Thanks for breaking glass
where my kids play.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.632
Thanks, buddy.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.801
There's a transmitter in the canoe.

21:42.885 --> 21:46.346
That way, if you guys disappear,
at least we'll get our boat back.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.974
It's child's play, guy. We got it.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.601
-It's beautiful!
-This is the best.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.853
-I like it out here.
-This is Spirit River!

21:53.938 --> 21:56.022
Get you out of the doctor's office, Dano.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.315
-It's good to be outside.
-Yeah.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.859
Get you away from that computer, Jer!

22:06.909 --> 22:09.077
-What kind of fish are those?
-That's brown trout.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.329
-That's big fish.
-Brown trout?

22:14.917 --> 22:17.836
-Hey, look, a deer! Wow!
-That's cool.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.422
Right out there in the open.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.301
Hey...

22:42.987 --> 22:44.404
Cheers.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.865
The great outdoors!

22:46.949 --> 22:50.535
-Tom! You guys are spraying me!
-Give me a break,

22:50.619 --> 22:51.703
-I'm writing your name!
-Stop that!

22:56.125 --> 22:58.501
-Hey, don't, don't, don't!
-What, are you gonna melt?

22:58.586 --> 23:01.129
No, but this water is teeming
with microbes.

23:01.756 --> 23:02.922
Stop.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.428
They don't let losers in a splash fight!

23:15.811 --> 23:18.646
So this is Spirit River.
We take that to Widowmaker Bend.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.982
And then we hike the Devil's Staircase,

23:21.067 --> 23:23.151
and that should lead us
to the top of Hellfire Ridge.

23:23.235 --> 23:27.030
What's with all these satanic names?
Isn't there, like, a Fluffy Bunny Way?

23:27.114 --> 23:29.741
No, but there's
a Shut Up You Big Baby Ridge.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.534
Okay, just keep your eyes open

23:31.619 --> 23:33.912
-for our first day's marker.
-What's that?

23:33.996 --> 23:36.915
It's a rock formation called
Grandpa's Nose.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.500
Grandpa's Nose.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.710
Looking for Grandpa's Nose.

23:41.796 --> 23:44.339
I think I see it! It's right there.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.758
Good work, Dan.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.677
Prepare to port.
I'm gonna drink some beer!

23:49.762 --> 23:52.680
I predict you'll be puking in that river
before the end of the night, Tom.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.475
Dry timber.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.315
Hi there, coalminer's daughter.
You want a hand?

24:02.399 --> 24:05.610
Or you can always try these fancy
new things called matches.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.654
I saw how to do this on
the Discovery Channel, okay?

24:07.738 --> 24:10.156
And I'm gonna do it. I got it covered.

24:10.241 --> 24:14.202
Oxygen in there...
Get that right combination...

24:22.878 --> 24:24.712
Stop, drop and roll!

24:27.591 --> 24:29.259
Why would you do that?

24:29.343 --> 24:32.053
I'm with my face right next to the...
And you blow...

24:32.138 --> 24:34.514
-Why would you do that?
-It's warm.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.808
It's a nice fire.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.644
Hey. We did it.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.313
I told you.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.736
Do you really want to hurt me?

24:49.780 --> 24:53.449
Do you really wanna hear this crap?

24:53.534 --> 24:55.827
Please. You liked this song
just as much as I did.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.621
When we were kids,
it didn't matter what the song was.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.499
We weren't wrapped up
in what was cool and uncool.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.585
We just listened to the music.

25:03.669 --> 25:07.297
It should be like that now.
Just listen to the song, man.

25:11.594 --> 25:14.345
Wow! This song is so uncool.

25:14.430 --> 25:18.600
-Well, I like it. It soothes me.
-Dan, what is wrong with you?

25:19.935 --> 25:21.644
I'm blessed with good taste.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.855
One day, you'll see
I've always been correct.

25:23.939 --> 25:28.610
Don't get cocky, 30-year-old Dr. Mott
with 46 years of school under his belt.

25:28.694 --> 25:32.071
Excuse me for getting an M.D.
and starting a successful practice.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.532
Well, excuse me.
I found a way to make 12 grand a month

25:34.617 --> 25:35.992
without having an M.D.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.911
Really? How do you do that?

25:37.995 --> 25:40.371
Yeah, what, are you running immigrants
over the border again, coyote?

25:40.456 --> 25:42.707
Those guys fell asleep in my truck.

25:42.791 --> 25:46.544
I thought I'd just gotten shitfaced
and bought a bunch of sombreros.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.547
I didn't know
there were dudes underneath.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.466
For real, though?

25:51.550 --> 25:56.471
Selling Harleys.
It's the greatest gig on the planet.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.640
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.225
Seriously, though, you guys both sound

26:00.309 --> 26:02.685
-like you're doing great.
-Aren't you?

26:02.770 --> 26:06.564
I just don't know if I'm cut out for
the whole family-wife-kids thing.

26:06.649 --> 26:10.777
I would kill to have a woman at home
willing to have sex with me every night.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.323
And at work, I just sit in my office
and I think,

26:15.407 --> 26:17.951
"There's gotta be something better
out there." You know what I mean?

26:18.035 --> 26:21.329
-I thought you liked your job.
-I like to surf.

26:21.413 --> 26:26.417
Sitting out in the water.
Waiting for that perfect wave.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.549
And I also like being out here.
I like this, right now.

26:33.634 --> 26:37.720
The first time in months,
no worries, no responsibilities.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.889
Just living in the moment.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.518
Just like Billy did.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.313
Hey. Here's to Billy.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.107
-To our dead friend.
-Get them up.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.692
Tom.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.445
Hey, Dano, what ever happened

26:54.530 --> 26:56.364
between you and Cockeyed Katie,
anyway?

26:56.448 --> 26:58.116
You know, I don't appreciate
the name-calling.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.534
Katie was very attractive.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.828
It was a mutual separation.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.621
Yeah, between her eyes.

27:03.706 --> 27:06.499
That girl had not one,
but two wandering eyes.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.919
It was like her eyes were trying
to escape from her head.

27:10.004 --> 27:12.755
You know, Tom, I'm sorry she wasn't
up to your high standard of women.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.133
No tattoos below the waist,
never worked as a carny.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.969
Name one girlfriend of mine
who worked as a carny.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.055
Jo Jo, the one who had
her downstairs pierced.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.932
Jo Jo. That's one.

27:23.017 --> 27:25.143
How do you know what she did
with her downstairs?

27:25.227 --> 27:26.394
She had that website,

27:26.478 --> 27:29.647
-JoJosDownstairs.com.
-That was a good one.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.816
All right, Dano, let's see
what you packed us for dinner.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.986
-What is this, astronaut food?
-No. It's a vitamin gel pack.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.321
It tastes like watermelon. It's very filling

27:36.405 --> 27:37.613
and it preserves well for camping.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.950
-It's leaking.
-I'm not an astronaut. I'm an American.

27:41.035 --> 27:44.245
And there's fresh salmon
in that river for the taking.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.749
-What?
-I'm eating salmon tonight.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.335
That's a great idea,
except we didn't bring any fishing gear.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.711
Don't need any.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.341
-We'll shine them.
-That would kill a fish.

27:56.425 --> 27:59.677
Shine the fish, old Cherokee trick.

27:59.762 --> 28:02.597
Yeah, I forgot the Cherokee
had been using the flashlight

28:02.681 --> 28:03.931
for thousands of years.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.933
No, didn't they pioneer the D battery?

28:06.018 --> 28:07.560
All right, suckers.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.688
Let's see who's eating salmon tonight
and who's eating crow.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.774
Why, do you have
a crow-catching trick, too?

28:12.858 --> 28:17.278
Yuk it up, astronauts.
They love figure eights.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.655
Hey, 100 grand and my left nut says

28:19.740 --> 28:22.158
the only thing you catch
out there is a cold.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.535
Got it! Grab it!

28:25.621 --> 28:27.455
What are you doing?

28:28.082 --> 28:30.041
-Fantastic.
-Can you do that again?

28:30.125 --> 28:33.086
You owe me 100 grand and the left nut.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.545
Are you gonna catch it
when I throw it up?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.506
-Yeah, yeah!
-Yeah, yeah, come on!

28:36.590 --> 28:40.426
I'm gonna have to use a distinct pattern
now. They got used to the figure eight.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.473
It's gonna be tough, but I'll focus.

28:46.809 --> 28:47.975
What the hell are you doing?

28:48.310 --> 28:51.771
I toss it, you grab it.
That's your part of the deal.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.816
What?

28:57.820 --> 29:00.196
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking off my shoes.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.990
-Why?
-Because I run faster with no shoes.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.452
-You can't outrun that bear.
-I don't have to outrun the bear.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.246
I just have to outrun you.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.747
Stay calm.

29:09.832 --> 29:13.084
It's important that you don't
let them smell your fear.

29:13.168 --> 29:16.170
-Just follow my lead.
-What are you gonna do?

29:18.549 --> 29:21.467
It's a bear! We're all gonna die!

29:21.552 --> 29:23.177
Run!

29:23.262 --> 29:24.262
It's too fast!

29:25.264 --> 29:26.305
Go!

29:27.433 --> 29:28.433
Faster!

29:29.184 --> 29:30.518
Keep going!

29:43.157 --> 29:44.449
Get out!

29:44.533 --> 29:46.534
-Go away! Go!
-Get out!

29:50.706 --> 29:53.666
-Stay calm. Get in the foetal position.
-God.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.461
It won't bother you
if you're in the foetal position.

29:56.545 --> 29:57.837
Jer!

30:03.677 --> 30:07.054
-Nothing's gonna happen now.
-Is he gone? Is he gone?

30:07.139 --> 30:09.307
Abort the foetal position! It's not working!

30:09.391 --> 30:10.850
-It's not working!
-Run!

30:10.934 --> 30:12.560
No...

30:15.689 --> 30:17.940
The bear thinks Dan's her cub.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.743
What do we do now?

30:34.416 --> 30:38.211
Stay... Stay down.
Don't... Don't make eye contact.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.256
-Help me!
-Let's go.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.592
This is bad. This is really bad.
Do something.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.011
-Go first.
-No, you go first.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.100
What...

30:53.185 --> 30:55.645
Hey. Where's the bear?

31:09.743 --> 31:13.120
He's trying to fatten Dan up
so they can hibernate together.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.214
Chew it up and eat it.

31:24.258 --> 31:25.800
Eat it.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.436
-Stop pretending.
-Dan, you have to eat it.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.939
You have to actually eat it.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.441
-Okay.
-Bite.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.570
Eat it.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.752
It's delicious. Very good, thank you.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.921
Is there another one?

32:06.508 --> 32:09.927
That was good. That was real good.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.724
-Let's go.
-Okay.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.564
-Move, move, move!
-Up the tree.

32:21.648 --> 32:22.857
Go!

32:27.613 --> 32:30.531
-Your mom misses you.
-She's in my stuff.

32:31.241 --> 32:34.619
Hey, that's my phone.
She ate my phone.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.998
How long do you think
she'll keep looking for me?

32:39.082 --> 32:41.417
Hour, hour and a half, tops.

32:41.501 --> 32:45.087
Bears have very short attention spans.
I know a guy who trains them.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.172
Okay.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.482
What was that?

33:06.360 --> 33:10.571
I don't know, but it scared away
our friend. Let's get out of here.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.575
What do you think could happen
if this thing went off right in the boat?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.827
-You think we'd die?
-I think you throw it right now.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.788
What if I toss it to you
and then you throw it?

33:18.872 --> 33:20.956
Elwood, throw it!

33:22.334 --> 33:24.001
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

33:24.086 --> 33:26.754
-Cue the insane hillbillies.
-What are these freaks doing?

33:26.838 --> 33:27.922
They're fishing.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.341
Why aren't they using
their flashlights, Tom?

33:30.425 --> 33:32.176
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

33:32.260 --> 33:33.511
This is exactly what you hear about

33:33.595 --> 33:35.846
when people go into the deep woods
in the middle of summertime.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.807
Aside from getting all sorts
of diseases and things,

33:37.891 --> 33:40.851
they just wind up being the victims
of some kind of unexpected man-rape.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.104
How you like me now, boy?

33:43.188 --> 33:46.399
-I don't like this...
-Quiet. Go, go.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.986
She ate everything.
Including my very expensive cell phone.

33:51.071 --> 33:54.532
All right, let's load up.
There's treasure in them hills.

33:54.616 --> 33:57.076
Wait a minute, you're not actually
considering continuing, are you?

33:57.160 --> 33:58.953
-Why not?
-Well, because I just...

33:59.037 --> 34:02.873
I got carried away by a bear. And then
we spent the night sleeping in a tree.

34:02.958 --> 34:06.711
Well, we got that out of the way.
Now we can get back on the river.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.045
There comes a time in every cub's life

34:09.130 --> 34:11.966
when he needs to strike out
and make it on his own.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.175
Fine.

34:13.260 --> 34:17.054
Fine. But I say we avoid them and we
launch around the bend there, okay?

34:17.139 --> 34:19.806
All right, all right. Heave-ho.

34:21.143 --> 34:24.520
They call this portage. Or "portage."

34:25.355 --> 34:29.065
-What's the map say, Jerry?
-You know, it's a map.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.985
It's gonna be... It's gonna be good.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.072
Jer, isn't the river supposed to fork?

34:35.157 --> 34:38.701
No. It just goes straight the whole way.
Straight shot.

34:38.784 --> 34:40.119
Are you sure?

34:40.203 --> 34:42.788
We are back in business, boys.

34:45.292 --> 34:49.170
All right. Let's rudder back.
Bring the tail out.

34:52.132 --> 34:56.427
-It's getting kind of rough, Tom.
-Not bad, I've been in much worse.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.971
Really?

34:59.055 --> 35:01.265
Not a good time to read a map, Jer.

35:01.850 --> 35:05.227
Guys, I wanna pull over.
I need to take some Dramamine...

35:05.312 --> 35:08.022
I got the stern.
Work the bow, work the bow, Jer.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.483
Guys, let's pull over.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.611
This is exactly what you'd expect.
We're doing great.

35:13.695 --> 35:16.155
Tom, guide us to the bank.

35:16.239 --> 35:19.074
-Watch the current.
-Trees! Trees left!

35:24.122 --> 35:26.123
No problem.
That's typical river behaviour.

35:26.208 --> 35:29.585
-Rocks! Rocks! Keep rowing!
-Tom, you're not guiding us right!

35:29.669 --> 35:31.796
I'm not having the fun you promised me!

35:31.880 --> 35:33.631
Just keep rowing!

35:38.678 --> 35:40.262
-Follow my lead!
-Terrible!

35:40.347 --> 35:42.431
Same stroke, same stroke!

35:42.516 --> 35:43.974
-Tom?
-Yes?

35:44.059 --> 35:46.185
-It's getting big.
-No problem.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.020
Like, real big.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.816
-I'm in over my head!
-What?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.859
-Don't tell me that!
-I'm in over my head!

35:53.944 --> 35:55.319
Please don't tell me that!

35:55.403 --> 35:58.113
Forward! No, backstroke! Backstroke!

36:00.075 --> 36:01.992
Come on!

36:10.752 --> 36:12.169
Dano!

36:12.254 --> 36:13.546
Tom!

36:14.422 --> 36:15.673
Help!

36:19.427 --> 36:21.929
Jerry! Help!

36:24.432 --> 36:26.433
-Dan! I'm coming!
-Do you see me?

36:26.518 --> 36:28.894
-Dan!
-Jerry!

36:28.979 --> 36:31.438
-Dano!
-Throw it! Jer!

36:31.523 --> 36:33.107
Catch the rope!

36:34.317 --> 36:36.235
I got you! Dano!

36:42.450 --> 36:44.743
-Dan, come on, baby, I got you.
-Hypothermia!

36:44.828 --> 36:47.496
-I'm gonna get hypothermia!
-Come on!

36:49.165 --> 36:52.126
You all right? Hold on.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.712
-Tom! Tommy!
-Tom!

36:54.796 --> 36:56.630
In here, boys!

37:01.428 --> 37:03.095
We made it!

37:03.722 --> 37:06.056
That's how you go down the rapids!

37:06.141 --> 37:08.142
-All right, get in.
-Get up.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.523
-I about shit. Did you about shit?
-I about shit.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.442
-I did shit.
-Oh, shit.

37:16.526 --> 37:19.403
-Oh, shit? What "oh, shit"?
-What? What, what?

37:20.405 --> 37:24.325
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, shit!

37:33.668 --> 37:35.836
I don't believe this.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.883
Tom,

37:40.967 --> 37:43.928
-where were you a river guide?
-San Dimas.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.180
-Raging Waters?
-Yeah.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.681
They had some
serious rapids there, man.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.976
-What, class toddler?
-Hey, I was employee of the month

37:51.061 --> 37:52.561
at the Monsoon Lagoon.

37:52.646 --> 37:54.063
-I knew you were lying.
-Great.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.856
-You did?
-I knew it.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.567
Well, you're the reason
that we had to launch the boat

37:58.652 --> 37:59.693
in the wrong part of the river.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.029
Hey, I am not the navigator-map guy.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.240
Okay, Jerry, didn't you see on the map
that the river split?

38:05.325 --> 38:09.328
I would've, if your friend,
the big-ass bear, didn't eat the map.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.372
Hold on a sec. Tom?

38:11.456 --> 38:12.998
Were you really employee of the month?

38:13.083 --> 38:16.543
No. I lied about that, too.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.296
I must have been crazy. I...

38:19.381 --> 38:23.133
All right. This trip is officially over.
This is finished! Let's...

38:23.218 --> 38:26.387
-Let's just go home.
-I agree. That's a great decision.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.640
All we gotta do is jump up over
that 100-foot waterfall,

38:29.724 --> 38:32.393
swim upstream 20 miles,
get the sheriff on the phone,

38:32.477 --> 38:35.521
he liked us, I remember,
and he'll send out a rescue boat. And...

38:35.605 --> 38:38.816
Hey, there's a beer in the river. Cool.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.026
Look at this, it's cold.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.822
We are in serious trouble, my friends.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.658
All data points to us being...
How do you humans say it?

38:47.742 --> 38:49.201
Completely screwed?

38:49.285 --> 38:52.121
Yeah. You know, that is...
That's a good way to say it.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.998
I mean, it pretty much sums it up.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.582
I suspect Tom is drunk.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.167
I didn't wanna say anything because

38:57.252 --> 38:58.335
-he's such a live wire...
-You guys, we're fine.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.171
We got the compass.
I've got Billy's compass!

39:01.256 --> 39:04.341
-Look, that's east, west, north.
-East...

39:04.426 --> 39:06.343
-That's south.
-That's south! That's south!

39:06.428 --> 39:07.970
That's great!

39:08.638 --> 39:10.347
-What?
-Sorry.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.224
It only works with the map.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.643
So you're saying you lost the map?
You don't have it?

39:14.728 --> 39:16.687
No. I'm saying I forgot to hold on to it

39:16.771 --> 39:19.857
while my ass was free-falling
over a 100-foot waterfall.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.817
So you don't have it?

39:23.611 --> 39:25.612
Hey, do you hear that?

39:26.114 --> 39:29.158
-Hell, yeah.
-Hey, that sounds like Creed.

39:29.242 --> 39:33.120
I never thought I'd be happy to hear
anything that sounds like Creed.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.667
Lights.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.881
Thank you, God. Civilization.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.716
-Look at that.
-They have a fire.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.636
-You think they're cooking food?
-I hope so. I am starving.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.728
-Damn it, Elwood. This blade is dull.
-Ain't my fault.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.607
-See how I popped off that fish head?
-What is it?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.734
I told you not to use my Buck knife.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.278
How you like me now, fish?

40:06.362 --> 40:09.323
You ain't so tough without a head, huh?

40:09.407 --> 40:11.784
What's that? You can't hear me?

40:12.160 --> 40:13.577
That's right, 'cause you don't have ears,

40:13.661 --> 40:16.580
'cause you don't have a head,
'cause I cut it off!

40:18.291 --> 40:21.043
Okay, that's... I mean,
that's a little weird, right?

40:21.127 --> 40:24.671
-We should get out of here.
-Listen, I say we just try talking...

40:25.507 --> 40:26.882
Shut it.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.426
What the hell was that?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.056
-Is that a gun?
-That's a gun.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.323
Must've been a possum.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.283
Boll weevil.

40:54.119 --> 40:58.122
-Guns and fish heads...
-It's okay, Dano, relax.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.792
We'll just lay low.
We'll get out of here in a second.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.418
-Hey.
-Yeah?

41:03.503 --> 41:07.589
-These guys are pot farmers.
-What? How do you know that?

41:13.721 --> 41:15.848
Oh, boy. We should go.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.561
Lynyrd. Skynyrd. Come here.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.360
Don't you go spoil them dogs.

41:28.444 --> 41:31.071
Lots of vitamins in these fish heads.

41:31.781 --> 41:35.534
Look at that. Skynyrd likes fish heads
almost as much as you do.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.494
Do you think they saw us?

41:37.579 --> 41:39.746
No, I don't.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.003
-What are you doing?
-What?

41:46.087 --> 41:47.880
I'll write you a prescription. Let's go.

41:47.964 --> 41:49.798
-Come on.
-All right.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.893
On my go. Ready?

42:06.774 --> 42:08.942
Go, go, back here. Come on.

42:12.572 --> 42:16.325
Hey, guys.
Listen. We don't want any trouble.

42:16.409 --> 42:19.870
We just got lost on the river, you know?

42:19.954 --> 42:22.873
-Hey, can we use your phone?
-Of course.

42:22.957 --> 42:24.958
And... Who cares, you know?

42:31.799 --> 42:35.177
-Let's go through there.
-Where? There's no door.

42:39.224 --> 42:42.309
-Lynyrd, Skynyrd! Get them!
-Come on, Dano.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.771
-Good work, buddy.
-Thanks.

42:45.855 --> 42:48.148
-Let's go.
-Come on, Dano.

42:49.150 --> 42:50.734
Come on!

42:50.818 --> 42:52.694
Go, go, go! This way!

42:58.660 --> 43:00.077
What did you do?

43:00.161 --> 43:02.663
Flares! Why are there flares?

43:04.624 --> 43:07.000
Great mother of ganja.

43:07.877 --> 43:09.753
Come on! I see them! I got them!

43:09.837 --> 43:12.714
-Hey, boys, come back here.
-We ain't gonna hurt you, boys!

43:12.799 --> 43:16.593
-We just wanna talk to you.
-There they are. Right there!

43:16.678 --> 43:20.013
Damn it, you head to the left,
and I'll cut them off.

43:21.057 --> 43:23.058
-Go, go, go!
-They're shooting!

43:23.893 --> 43:26.228
I think I got them, Dennis!

43:26.771 --> 43:28.605
They're shooting at us! Run!

43:29.274 --> 43:31.900
Come on, Dennis, I'm gonna get them!

43:32.527 --> 43:33.527
Just keep going!

43:40.702 --> 43:43.036
Damn it! I can't see nothing
through this smoke!

43:43.121 --> 43:45.914
-We're dead. We're dead!
-We're dead!

43:47.375 --> 43:50.711
-We're dead!
-They're gonna... They're gonna...

43:55.425 --> 43:56.842
We're gonna die!

43:58.761 --> 44:01.513
You set the security flares
too close, Elwood.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.682
The whole damn field's on fire.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.393
Where the hell are the damn dogs?

44:09.314 --> 44:10.314
You guys gotta promise me that

44:10.398 --> 44:11.940
you'll never tell my patients
that I got stoned,

44:12.025 --> 44:14.818
because if they found out I got stoned,
they'll think that I'm a stoner.

44:14.902 --> 44:16.903
The next thing you know,
I won't have a license anymore.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.823
And they'll take away all my instruments
and my coat and my office,

44:19.907 --> 44:21.992
and I won't have
a parking space anymore.

44:22.076 --> 44:25.370
I just don't wanna lose all my stuff.
I lost my legs...

44:31.669 --> 44:34.504
Great. We got us
a couple of weed freaks.

44:34.589 --> 44:37.132
What the hell are they looking at?

44:37.925 --> 44:40.052
Get up, you stoner dogs!

44:42.055 --> 44:43.513
Get up. Get up.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.183
You gotta move your legs.
Move your legs.

44:46.851 --> 44:48.852
I think I see them.

44:48.936 --> 44:51.438
They got laser scopes.
They had you pinned.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.398
Dudes.

44:53.941 --> 44:56.777
Dudes, dudes. Seriously. Seriously.

44:57.362 --> 45:01.907
I will give you four cows
for Denise's hand in marriage.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.620
I'll give them something to laugh about.

45:20.468 --> 45:21.968
Matrix.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.515
My back.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.183
Cut them off at the river.

45:28.267 --> 45:30.227
Jerry, Jerry.

45:31.312 --> 45:33.939
Billy! Jesus, Billy!

45:34.816 --> 45:37.734
-I miss you.
-You gonna find D.B.'s treasure?

45:37.819 --> 45:39.861
I'm just trying to make it
out of here alive.

45:39.946 --> 45:43.865
Don't give up. Keep looking.
Hey, is it cool to be a grown-up?

45:43.950 --> 45:45.367
Not really, my man.

45:45.451 --> 45:48.078
Stop! Stop! You're gonna run into...

45:53.209 --> 45:54.835
We can't outrun them. We gotta hide.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.212
-Quick, hide.
-How? How?

45:57.296 --> 45:58.880
Let's get them!

46:02.468 --> 46:06.138
Man, our whole crop is burning!
Those assholes are dead!

46:06.514 --> 46:08.598
And the bodies that are attached
to them are dead, too!

46:08.683 --> 46:10.809
Dead! D-E-A-D! Dead!

46:10.893 --> 46:14.729
-Assholes! A-S-S-H-O...
-Stop spelling!

46:14.814 --> 46:17.607
-Come on, you're dead!
-We're gonna get you!

46:17.692 --> 46:21.695
-You can only run so far!
-And you can never hide!

46:36.127 --> 46:39.171
-Bullfrogs.
-I hate bullfrogs. They're nasty.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.551
Don't waste the ammo.

46:44.635 --> 46:48.013
Come on, they must've headed up
towards the river.

46:55.730 --> 46:58.732
-It crawled straight in my stomach.
-Let's go.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.735
I think it laid its eggs in my stomach.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.077
You think they're still following us?

47:11.162 --> 47:14.456
I don't wanna stop and find out.
Just keep going.

47:15.583 --> 47:19.002
It's not all burnt.
I think we're gonna be okay.

47:19.086 --> 47:20.420
-You think?
-Yeah.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.589
-You think?
-Yeah.

47:23.549 --> 47:28.136
Damn it. It's all burnt. Now, I knew it,
Dennis. It's all burnt. Every bit.

47:28.221 --> 47:29.679
-They burned it.
-Oh, yeah.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.181
-Believe it.
-It's all burnt.

47:31.265 --> 47:34.851
The whole damn field is burnt.
But we got a bigger problem, Elwood!

47:34.936 --> 47:38.021
We got three bona fide yuppies
out there,

47:38.105 --> 47:40.941
lost somewhere,
and we gotta track them.

47:41.025 --> 47:43.902
We gotta catch them
and we gotta kill them.

47:44.570 --> 47:48.448
I think we can slow down.
I haven't heard dogs or guns for hours.

47:48.533 --> 47:51.117
Yeah? You slow down,
get a stick of dynamite up your ass.

47:51.202 --> 47:54.329
Calm down, Daniel,
we're gonna be all right.

47:54.413 --> 47:58.041
No, we're not, Jerry.
We could really die out here.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.377
Man, I can't believe
that I would listen to you guys.

48:00.461 --> 48:02.712
"Let's go take Billy's trip.

48:02.797 --> 48:05.549
"Let's... Let's find D.B.'s treasure.

48:05.633 --> 48:07.634
"I'll get a canoe. I'll get some rope."

48:07.718 --> 48:09.844
-Is he all right?
-"It's gonna be great."

48:09.929 --> 48:13.265
-"We'll find D.B.'s treasure!" Right!
-Is he having a panic attack?

48:13.349 --> 48:14.474
-I don't know.
-That's great. Make jokes.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.226
That's a really good idea.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.436
Is this living in the moment
enough for you, Jerry?

48:18.521 --> 48:21.273
Is this the carefree life with
no responsibility that you wanted?

48:21.357 --> 48:25.527
Is this the... Is this the great wilderness
adventure that you were dreaming of?

48:25.611 --> 48:28.697
How should I be, Dr. Dan? Tell me.

48:28.781 --> 48:30.699
-Be afraid.
-I am afraid.

48:30.783 --> 48:34.411
Well, then, act like it!
It is very confusing to people in your life

48:34.495 --> 48:36.454
when you don't act the way
that you're feeling!

48:36.539 --> 48:38.498
And no wonder Denise
is fed up with you.

48:38.583 --> 48:40.917
-What did you say?
-Don't you step to me.

48:41.002 --> 48:42.711
-Take it easy.
-Put your hands down.

48:42.795 --> 48:43.962
You take it easy.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.839
Mr. Joe Tattoo, Mr. Motorcycle Man,

48:45.923 --> 48:49.301
-Mr. Super-Cool, Mr. Bullet Wound...
-Oh, you're gonna start with me now?

48:49.385 --> 48:53.179
-Oh, my... Tom, you got shot.
-Oh, cool.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.473
-He got shot?
-Yeah. Come here.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.268
-Are you all right?
-You could lose a roll of pennies

48:58.352 --> 48:59.936
in that thing. Look at how deep it is.

49:00.021 --> 49:02.397
Yeah, it just grazed you, though.
You're really lucky.

49:02.481 --> 49:04.941
Oh, wow, that's gonna be a great scar.

49:05.026 --> 49:06.860
I'm gonna stitch it up good.

49:23.669 --> 49:25.003
Lose the cleaver.

49:25.087 --> 49:27.172
Meat cleaver's my favourite.

49:27.256 --> 49:29.799
It's scary, but ultimately ineffective.
Lose it.

49:29.884 --> 49:32.927
Now, Dennis, you don't understand...

49:33.012 --> 49:35.388
Them three boys get back to town,

49:35.473 --> 49:39.309
you're gonna spend the next 40 years
in the can getting manhandled.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.478
Quit messing around.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.229
Lose the cleaver.

49:46.192 --> 49:47.984
I love the cleaver.

49:49.654 --> 49:52.030
You'll be good as new. Sorry.

49:54.241 --> 49:55.617
Hey, Dano.

49:56.744 --> 49:58.536
I'm sorry I got you into this.

49:58.621 --> 50:01.498
-I really am.
-Jerry, I wanted to come.

50:01.582 --> 50:04.501
Well, we're getting out of it. I promise.
And when we do,

50:04.585 --> 50:06.002
someone's buying the first round. Not it.

50:06.087 --> 50:08.004
-Not it.
-Tom, I think you're buying

50:08.089 --> 50:12.842
with all that Harley money.
Oh, God, it's making me sick.

50:12.927 --> 50:14.469
I'm sorry, I...

50:15.763 --> 50:17.430
That whole thing was an exaggeration.

50:17.515 --> 50:21.059
-What, you don't make that much?
-No, I don't sell Harleys.

50:21.143 --> 50:25.480
In fact, the only thing I've sold lately
is some clothes and CD's.

50:25.564 --> 50:27.148
They weren't even mine.

50:27.233 --> 50:30.068
Tom, that's not an exaggeration,
that's a lie.

50:30.152 --> 50:32.987
-You know, you lie a lot.
-I know.

50:33.072 --> 50:34.948
What happened?

50:35.032 --> 50:39.035
Well, first it was blackjack.
Then the cards went south.

50:39.120 --> 50:42.205
So then I started betting
football and baseball.

50:42.289 --> 50:43.998
I lost everything.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.584
What'd I expect? I got no luck, Jerry.

50:46.669 --> 50:50.213
I mean, it's like my old man used to say,
"Family curse.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.549
"If we didn't have bad luck,
we wouldn't have luck at all."

50:52.633 --> 50:54.926
You have got to stop
blaming your old man.

50:55.010 --> 50:56.261
I'm not blaming anyone.

50:56.345 --> 50:58.513
Yeah, you are. Listen to yourself.
"The family curse."

50:58.597 --> 51:00.890
Yeah, it's real. I'm a great gambler.

51:00.975 --> 51:03.059
I will give you one thing,
your dad was a piece of work.

51:03.144 --> 51:06.104
I mean, he had his own things going on.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.231
But if he did one thing right,

51:08.315 --> 51:11.109
it was not raising a complete idiot.
You're not him, Tommy.

51:11.193 --> 51:13.778
You're a lot smarter, for one thing.

51:14.739 --> 51:16.197
Right, Dano?

51:19.827 --> 51:22.370
Well, I wouldn't say a lot smarter.

51:24.206 --> 51:28.251
Tom, you have a lot more
going for you than you think you do.

51:28.335 --> 51:31.379
That's easy for you to say, Dano.
You're a freaking doctor.

51:31.464 --> 51:35.383
I mean, you got a big old
bank account, a ginormous house,

51:35.468 --> 51:37.135
-big, thick, red hair...
-You know what?

51:37.219 --> 51:39.095
I wouldn't be so jealous of me
if I were you.

51:39.180 --> 51:42.682
Every day I develop
some new and exciting phobia.

51:42.767 --> 51:45.935
-You're exaggerating again.
-I'm afraid of the dark, Jerry.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.563
So? There's a lot of people
that are afraid of the dark.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.690
-I know a shitload.
-I'm afraid of small spaces.

51:50.775 --> 51:52.692
Again, not that abnormal.

51:52.777 --> 51:55.361
-Cellophane.
-Like Saran Wrap?

51:55.446 --> 51:57.614
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you're alone on that one.

51:57.698 --> 52:00.200
See, I won't even keep it
in the house anymore, because I'm

52:00.284 --> 52:03.870
afraid that somehow it'll get,
like, draped over my head

52:03.954 --> 52:07.415
and stick to my mouth and nose
and I'll suffocate.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.667
-How pathetic is that?
-Very.

52:13.714 --> 52:16.090
Relax, you're almost through.

52:16.175 --> 52:19.928
There you go. Hey, would
one of you guys grab my phone? My...

52:20.012 --> 52:21.554
That's a phone.

52:23.057 --> 52:24.933
-It's that way.
-Phone!

52:25.768 --> 52:27.227
How did your phone
get all the way up here?

52:27.311 --> 52:30.563
-Who cares?
-That last thing I remember, it was...

52:32.733 --> 52:35.652
-Go, go, go!
-That bear loves you, Dano!

52:36.737 --> 52:40.114
Whiskey Dick, this is Lightning
Company. Come in, Whiskey Dick.

52:40.199 --> 52:45.245
We are on the move and loaded
for bear. Come back, come back...

52:46.705 --> 52:48.915
-Why'd you stop?
-Right there.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.084
Footprints.

52:53.254 --> 52:54.921
Oh, it's theirs.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.423
It's weird.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.553
Footprints with no people in them.

53:01.637 --> 53:03.263
I mean,

53:03.722 --> 53:05.640
it's like it's them,

53:06.100 --> 53:08.518
but it's not them,
you know what I mean?

53:08.602 --> 53:10.270
Rarely.

53:10.354 --> 53:12.063
Get on your wheeler.

53:12.648 --> 53:15.900
Hold on a second, guys.
You know what we should do?

53:15.985 --> 53:17.861
We're gonna climb the tree.

53:17.945 --> 53:18.903
All right, we'll climb the tree,

53:18.988 --> 53:21.531
we'll get a good look at the land,
maybe we'll see a road

53:21.615 --> 53:22.866
or a way out of here.

53:22.950 --> 53:25.451
Yeah, I'll go. Give me a boost.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.413
Oh, hey, Tom, wait. You can use these.

53:28.497 --> 53:29.706
Thanks.

53:29.790 --> 53:31.791
Please, just be careful.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.713
Are you maintaining
a safe distance back there?

53:36.797 --> 53:39.299
Yeah, two-second rule, I know.

53:40.676 --> 53:43.970
-Do you see anything?
-Hey, guys!

53:44.054 --> 53:46.389
This is really cool!

53:46.473 --> 53:48.600
What is he doing up there?

53:48.684 --> 53:51.853
Tommy, you see a road?

53:51.937 --> 53:53.980
Any signs of life?

53:56.108 --> 53:57.901
Are you kidding me?

53:59.069 --> 54:00.320
Tommy?

54:00.946 --> 54:03.781
Tom, do you see anything or not?

54:08.329 --> 54:10.705
I think I might still be stoned.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.504
Hello? Excuse me, miss?

54:18.589 --> 54:21.633
-Ladies?
-My name is Flower!

54:23.218 --> 54:25.595
You may call me Butterfly.

54:25.679 --> 54:27.388
And if you're from the logging company,

54:27.473 --> 54:29.974
you'll have to speak to our lawyers.

54:30.059 --> 54:32.602
If you look to your left,
you can totally see her downstairs.

54:32.686 --> 54:34.187
What?

54:34.271 --> 54:37.398
We're not from the logging company.

54:37.483 --> 54:38.524
-Peace.
-Peace.

54:38.609 --> 54:40.818
-Hey, peace.
-Peace.

54:40.903 --> 54:44.030
-What's your name?
-Jerry. Jerry Conlaine.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.282
And what's your forest name?

54:46.367 --> 54:49.369
Slug. His forest name is Slug.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.747
-I got you.
-Thanks, Tom, thanks a lot.

54:52.831 --> 54:55.959
I'm sorry, Slug.
We can't abandon our post.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.794
You understand.

54:57.878 --> 55:01.839
Well, could we come up there, then?
Please?

55:01.924 --> 55:03.049
Come on up.

55:03.175 --> 55:06.469
So then we run straight into
this freezing, like, water pond.

55:06.553 --> 55:09.472
We had to hide underwater,
but we used these reeds.

55:09.556 --> 55:12.308
Reeds? Like pussy willow reeds?
Really?

55:12.393 --> 55:13.393
Just like that.

55:13.477 --> 55:15.103
God, it must've been so hard to breathe.

55:15.187 --> 55:16.479
Yeah, yeah, it's been quite a trip.

55:16.563 --> 55:18.731
Do you guys have a cell phone
that we could use?

55:18.816 --> 55:21.818
Sorry, Slug. Cell phones are bad
for the environment

55:21.902 --> 55:23.820
and people who live in the environment.

55:23.904 --> 55:25.154
-Right.
-You poor boys.

55:25.239 --> 55:27.615
You need to get out
of those damp, dirty clothes.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.993
Here, let us wash them for you.

55:30.077 --> 55:32.620
-No, no. I'm fine.
-Let us nurture you.

55:33.998 --> 55:35.248
No, no, no!

55:35.332 --> 55:36.499
Oh, boy!

55:37.167 --> 55:39.794
Mighty Oak could go
for some nurturing.

55:40.087 --> 55:43.131
-Stay right there.
-No. It's...

55:43.215 --> 55:45.425
Just relax, Condor.

55:45.634 --> 55:49.429
No, it's okay, honestly. I'm actually
not really into being touched.

55:49.513 --> 55:53.016
I'm a doctor, you know,
so I usually do the touching.

55:53.100 --> 55:56.477
Yeah. I've been told I give
a very good calf massage.

55:56.562 --> 55:59.939
If you wanna roll down those stockings,
I could give you one.

56:00.024 --> 56:02.316
-Stockings?
-Leg warmers?

56:03.736 --> 56:05.361
I'm all-natural.

56:07.656 --> 56:09.240
Supernatural.

56:09.324 --> 56:15.038
-You guys live up here year-round?
-We've been here 287 beautiful days.

56:16.165 --> 56:17.582
How do you guys get supplies?

56:17.666 --> 56:21.627
When we need supplies, we radio
the Earth Child Support Network.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.296
Radio?

56:23.380 --> 56:25.548
You... You guys have a radio?

56:25.632 --> 56:29.260
Yeah. We haven't used it
since that last big thunderstorm.

56:29.344 --> 56:30.887
Remember that, Flower?

56:30.971 --> 56:35.725
Oh, my God.
That thunderstorm was so spiritual.

56:35.809 --> 56:40.396
Earth Child's limbs were just waving,
heaving back and forth,

56:40.481 --> 56:44.901
like she was dancing in the rhythm
to the thunder. It was just like...

56:49.448 --> 56:52.700
Full-on tantric orgasm.

56:52.785 --> 56:55.828
-So where's this radio?
-Tree had an orgasm?

56:55.913 --> 56:56.954
You don't say.

56:57.039 --> 57:01.375
We danced naked in the storm all night.

57:01.460 --> 57:05.171
And then held each other,
soaking wet, until the morning.

57:06.256 --> 57:10.134
The rain is like a drug.
You know, it just makes you wanna...

57:11.553 --> 57:13.679
What? Makes you wanna what?

57:17.017 --> 57:18.893
Can we please use the radio?

57:18.977 --> 57:20.645
Sure thing, Slug.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.273
Wow. Monkey feet.

57:24.358 --> 57:26.692
Yeah. It's like a second pair of hands.

57:26.777 --> 57:29.695
Hello? Anyone out there?
My name's Jerry Conlaine,

57:29.780 --> 57:32.949
and my two friends and I
are lost in the woods. Hello?

57:33.033 --> 57:35.284
-You gotta say "Over."
-Over.

57:35.369 --> 57:39.372
I read you, son.
This is Breaker Station 22.

57:40.040 --> 57:43.376
-What is your position? Over.
-See? He said, "Over."

57:44.253 --> 57:47.296
We are two miles east of Harold's Bluff

57:47.381 --> 57:51.717
in a giant redwood
called Earth Child. Over.

57:51.802 --> 57:57.515
In a tree. We'll find you.
We will give assistance and whatnot.

57:58.225 --> 58:00.309
Peace. Over.

58:00.394 --> 58:03.354
You just sit tight.
We're coming to get you.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.106
Over and out!

58:07.359 --> 58:09.777
So we ran out of food in Borneo,
so we just ended up

58:09.862 --> 58:13.114
eating our mosquito netting.
Just salted it up, and it was good.

58:13.198 --> 58:14.198
It was really good.

58:14.491 --> 58:17.410
Oh, you messy thing. Let me get that.

58:18.537 --> 58:19.662
Thank you.

58:19.746 --> 58:22.498
Well, there's plenty more
grubs here, Condor.

58:22.583 --> 58:25.585
Oh, no, I couldn't.
That bark shot right through me.

58:25.669 --> 58:28.296
I need to visit the little trees' room.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.548
Where do you guys do the do?

58:30.924 --> 58:32.466
Top side of the tree.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.886
Got a real kick to it.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.346
Wow!

58:37.598 --> 58:41.184
Bag it when you're done.
Put it in the basket up top.

58:41.268 --> 58:43.477
If you bring it in, you take it out.

58:43.562 --> 58:44.604
-Yeah.
-Right?

58:44.688 --> 58:46.772
Okay, will do.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.566
Do you have any paper?

58:49.943 --> 58:52.445
Oh, great. You know,

58:52.529 --> 58:54.405
I think I'm gonna wait
until we get to the ranger station.

58:54.489 --> 58:56.616
Someone's here, someone's here.

58:57.910 --> 59:01.370
-Afternoon, ladies.
-Nice-looking tree.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.247
End of the line, boys. Come on down.

59:03.332 --> 59:04.373
-They're gonna kill Earth Child.
-No!

59:04.458 --> 59:07.877
No, they're not gonna kill Earth Child.
They're after us.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.962
We gotta get down and we gotta
make a run for it, all right?

59:10.047 --> 59:11.047
Let's go!

59:12.424 --> 59:14.634
-No!
-No!

59:15.802 --> 59:17.136
Go to it, Elwood.

59:17.554 --> 59:20.389
We're gonna die up here
in this stupid tree.

59:20.474 --> 59:24.060
You know, Condor, even if your bodily
death is extraordinarily painful,

59:24.144 --> 59:27.438
-your soul will live on.
-Everything happens for a reason.

59:27.522 --> 59:30.733
Listen up, karma chameleons.
Nobody's dying.

59:30.817 --> 59:31.901
Here's the plan.

59:31.985 --> 59:34.278
Send those boys down,
pretty little birdies.

59:34.363 --> 59:37.740
I'm gonna rappel down.
And then I'm gonna secure the rope

59:37.824 --> 59:40.785
and then I'm gonna distract them.
You two slide down after me. All right?

59:40.869 --> 59:42.245
-Okay.
-Stop it!

59:42.329 --> 59:44.163
Cut it down, Elwood.

59:45.582 --> 59:48.084
Good plan, Jerry. One small change.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.503
Time to find out whether
I have the family curse or not.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.380
-For me, Jer? For me?
-Come on, boys!

59:52.464 --> 59:54.173
Can't wait to see you again!

59:54.258 --> 59:56.092
Yeah. Go, go, go.

59:56.176 --> 59:57.551
Give them hell, Tommy.

59:58.387 --> 01:00:02.390
This Hell-mart's open for business,
and I'm slashing prices.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:06.894
-Stop!
-Come on, boys, don't be afraid.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.437
We gotta cover him.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:10.022
I have an idea.

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.194
You just send those boys down.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:18.030
There won't be no more trouble
for you, Earth-mama.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:19.824
-Heavier than it looks.
-Oh, good idea.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:20.950
-Oh, yeah.
-You've got it.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.535
-Ready?
-You got it.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.043
-Oh, yes.
-I'm hit. I'm hit.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.378
It's doody, Dennis.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.255
One, two, three.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.299
Oh, shit.

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:37.800
Dano, let's go.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.720
Get away from my tree!

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.472
-This is wrong.
-Take that!

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.142
-Okay.
-I can't do this, Jerry.

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.393
Okay.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.728
Jamming up my gun barrel.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.814
-This is not me.
-You're a beautiful spirit.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:54.817
Fly free and know that love follows you.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:03.617
Thank you, kind, crazy, hairy
lady of my dreams.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:07.580
That was cute.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:11.459
-Get off my tree!
-Shoot her.

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:13.836
Filthy hippie! Shoot her again.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.838
That is it!

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:19.550
-I don't wanna do this, Jerry.
-Remember when we used to jump off

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:23.137
that railroad bridge into Cedar Lake?
That was higher than this.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.097
No, no. I never jumped off of there.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.350
You guys always pushed me
when I wasn't looking.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:28.684
Oh, yeah.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:33.606
Go!

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:40.196
-Hold on, Dan.
-I made it.

01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:43.199
What? Did I kill your grandma?

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:46.911
-I don't think so.
-Where are they getting all this poo?

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.124
He's getting away on my wheeler!

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:55.294
-Get him, Elwood.
-I'm gonna shoot him!

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:10.351
Come on, let's go. Get on, get on.
Move, baby, move. Come on, Jer.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:13.813
Go. Go.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.023
-Hold on.
-Come on, Dennis, we gotta move.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:18.234
All right, I'm on. Go. Go.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.821
Hold on, Dano.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.494
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:32.748
Shoot the one driving!

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:37.086
What are you doing?

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.631
I'm pretending I'm on a speeder bike
so I can block out reality.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.716
It's my process. Leave me alone.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:55.521
Over there. It looks like a clearing.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.897
That way.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.817
That way, that way, that way!

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.207
Damn it, Elwood.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.793
I think I just swallowed my underpants.

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:22.047
Shoot them.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:27.178
-I can't believe they survived that fall.
-Dennis, they're getting away.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:29.180
No, they're trapped like rats.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.098
Only way they can go now
is up the mountain.

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:34.143
We know right where they're headed.
Let's go.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.067
-Flat tire.
-Damn it, Tom.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:44.612
Keep moving.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.451
Getting close, Elwood.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.752
This way.

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:06.675
All right, that is it. I'm out.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.219
I'm out.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:09.762
I'm out.

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:14.975
I have spent the last, like, two hours
within sniffing distance

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:21.315
of a sweaty ball sack and a sweaty
ball sack, and I am out. I'm out.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:23.025
What does that mean?

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:27.154
I think it means he's out.
Like, coming out.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:29.698
Like, he's finally admitted he's gay.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.370
You know, I'm just gonna stay here
until help comes.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.373
I mean, this is serious.
I lost my inhaler.

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.458
I've known you almost, what,
25 years now?

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:43.504
I've never seen you have
even a hint of asthma, anything.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:48.342
That's because I have the inhaler, Jerry.

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:52.471
No, I think Jerry's right, I think
this whole thing's just in your head.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:56.141
You just need to take a couple of real
deep breaths and you'll get over it.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.601
Okay, why didn't I think of that?

01:04:57.686 --> 01:05:00.563
I'll just get over my chronic
respiratory illness.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.606
I'll just breathe.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.693
There you go. I'm over it.

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:08.028
See? That wasn't that hard, was it?

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:10.573
You gotta relax, Dano. All right?

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.993
It's no time to give up hope.
Let's just keep going.

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:18.205
No, actually, Jerry, I'm convinced that
this is the perfect time to give up hope.

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:21.584
I don't know that there has ever been
a better time to give up hope.

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.420
I mean, look at this.

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:28.173
Things are as bad
as they could possibly get.

01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.683
I stand corrected.

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:44.440
Elwood, what are you doing?

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.817
It's raining. It's raining.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:54.742
Tom, man, get under here.
You're gonna die of pneumonia.

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:57.369
No, but we will die of hypothermia.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:01.206
Look, our only chance
is to huddle together.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:04.084
We gotta huddle our bodies together
for warmth.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.503
I, for one, choose death.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.422
Interesting.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:11.925
One minute you mock
my sweaty ball sack

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:15.095
and now you wanna cuddle with it.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.641
You know, the whole huddle-up thing,

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:22.102
it's the oldest trick in the book.
I've used it.

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:25.564
-It's just for getting a girl naked.
-Worked, though.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.608
Every time.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.736
This never leaves the cave.

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:18.367
I'm starting to feel warm.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:20.869
See? I told you guys.

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:23.414
Let's just try and get some sleep.

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.460
Hey, Dano.

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:32.631
How hot were those chicks in the tree?

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.218
They were hairy but hot.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.762
The rain,

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:41.390
dancing to the rhythm of the thunder,

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:46.228
full-on tantric orgasm,
are you kidding me? Hey, didn't...

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:49.148
Didn't she kiss you once?

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:50.733
It was nice.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.651
Oh, my God.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:56.321
They are probably dancing naked
right now.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.116
Dancing.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:03.370
Soaking wet.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:06.999
Hey.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:11.128
Hey! Oh, my God, Dano,
how could you?

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:14.715
It wasn't me, it was Jerry.
Jerry, why would you do that?

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:17.341
I'm sorry. My bad. I'm so sorry.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.678
What happens in the cave,
stays in the cave.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:22.096
Oh, my God. That was your...

01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.265
Come back to bed, you guys.
I'm freezing.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.225
Not till he puts Jabba back in his hut.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.479
Freeze, perverts.

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.946
Wait, wait, wait, just...
Please don't shoot us, okay?

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.656
This isn't what it looks like.

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.408
If you're gonna rape somebody,
rape Dano.

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:44.203
Did I ask you to talk?

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.996
-No.
-Come with me

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.665
or I'll shoot your testicles off

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:52.294
and stuff them
and mount them on my mantelpiece.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.673
That's gonna be an ugly mantelpiece.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:00.093
-Go on.
-That's it, come on.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.027
What is it?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.447
Cinnamon.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:26.370
What the hell are you doing, collecting
herbs for your goddamn herb garden?

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:30.499
Well, all the twigs are broken.
They've been through here.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.417
That they have.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.127
-Nice place.
-Get along.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.091
-Build this yourself?
-Open the door.

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.679
-Okay, I'm going.
-That's it.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.848
It's a lot warmer in here.

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:01.113
I think he's gonna try to cook us.

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:06.952
Where you going?

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:18.171
Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:20.799
If you're gonna kill us,
just do it already, okay?

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.302
I am sick of waiting to die.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.511
Okay.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:27.723
-Was that reckless?
-Yes.

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:31.476
If I was gonna kill you,
I would have done it outside.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.145
-Thank you. Thank you.
-I agree.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.397
-You're a very gracious man.
-That's a good one.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.566
Yes, with a happy ending.

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:39.151
D.B.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.240
-What'd you call me?
-D.B. The maps...

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.826
You are, aren't you?
You're D.B. Cooper.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.037
No, I ain't D.B. Cooper.

01:10:51.623 --> 01:10:53.540
That's ancient history.

01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:57.419
I tell you
what's not ancient history, though.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:03.175
It's three naked deviants
on my mountain.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:07.763
We were searching for D.B.
And, yes, we're naked

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:11.850
and we're trespassing,
but there's a perfectly good explanation.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:17.272
First thing, I want you
to put some clothes on.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:23.570
And then I'd like to hear this story.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.822
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:27.699
More of your own homemade fashions?

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.077
I wouldn't mind wearing
one of these deer pelts up there.

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.787
I'd get dressed faster if I was you

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.289
because I've been alone in this cabin
for 30 years.

01:11:34.374 --> 01:11:35.540
-Oh, God.
-Okay.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:39.544
They would've come in here
to escape the rain.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:44.341
They laid down right here, Dennis.

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:45.634
Right here.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:47.386
Lay down beside me.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.888
In order to stalk your prey,

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:53.809
you gotta go where they go
and do what they do.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.478
Then a scuffle broke out,

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.480
and there were some harsh words
exchanged,

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:02.442
and they beat that little one
until he was limp.

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:04.152
Elwood,

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:05.862
I don't need to know what happened.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.824
I just need to know
which way they went.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:14.871
Up-mountain.
All right, let's get back to the wheeler.

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:16.707
I know a shortcut
around Devil's Staircase.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:19.251
We can still beat them to the summit.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:24.756
And then you, you scared us
with your testicle-mounting speech.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.883
That just came right off the top
of my head.

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:29.469
-It was very scary.
-It was creepy, too.

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:33.306
May I ask you one question?
Could you really see their downstairs?

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:37.019
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
You could see everything. It was...

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.895
It was quite a view.

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:42.107
So, Del,

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:46.153
-were you D.B.'s partner?
-And his best friend, too.

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:51.950
We've known each other ever since
we were able to pee straight.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.326
So...

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.665
-Is he still alive?
-Hell, I don't know.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.709
D.B. had this plan, see.

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:05.714
When he jumped out of the airplane,
he was gonna land

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:09.968
three degrees northwest
of Red Devil Ridge.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.889
And he had a flashlight.
He was gonna signal me,

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:19.144
I'd find him and then we were gonna
work our way down to Rio.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:21.772
I love Rio.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:23.899
What... What happened?

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:25.108
It snowed.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.944
A blizzard. You couldn't see anything.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:29.321
You couldn't see your hand
in front of your face.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.364
Hell, I don't know where he landed.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:35.452
I looked for him for months and months.
So did the FBI,

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:38.789
so did the cops. No D.B., no money.

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.708
But you could've left.

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:44.086
Why'd you stay up here all these years?

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.671
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.384
-You know what I mean, kid?
-Yeah, I do.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.429
Have you ever spent
30 years in a cabin?

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:56.765
-No.
-Then you don't know what I mean.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:14:00.310
I mean, metaphorically,
I know what you mean.

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:04.481
Well, metaphorically, have you ever
spent 30 years in a cabin?

01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:07.692
-No.
-Well, then, think before you talk.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:13.698
Point is, I've spent the best years
of my life sitting on the porch,

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.785
playing the harmonica,
waiting for something better,

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:20.122
and the years have been going by
faster and faster.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.873
And then all of a sudden,

01:14:22.834 --> 01:14:24.459
I was an old man.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:29.673
Well, I bet you can play the shit
out of that harmonica.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.300
That I can.

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.972
Except there's no one around
to hear me play it.

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:40.183
Piece of advice,
you can lose your money,

01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:42.811
you can spend it, all of it,

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:46.815
and if you work hard, you get it all back.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:49.192
But if you waste your time,

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:52.946
you're never gonna get it back.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:58.076
Whatever it is you fellas are looking for,

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:00.328
you gotta go out and get it.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.415
And you gotta go right now.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:08.920
Not right now, you idiots.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.759
Well, you boys get some sleep.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.804
In the morning, I'm gonna point you
in the right direction,

01:15:17.889 --> 01:15:20.223
get you right off this mountain.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:30.442
Morning.

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:37.240
-Bacon.
-Squirrel.

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:39.951
Squirrel.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:44.289
Nice T-shirt, J.J.

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:47.459
That's my J.J. Walker T-shirt.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.795
"Dy-no-mite."

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.006
Dy-no-mite.

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.717
Dy-no-mite.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.552
Dy-no-mite!

01:15:57.637 --> 01:15:59.054
No, that's too big.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:00.347
-Bathroom?
-Outside.

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.806
Thought so.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:04.142
Dy-no-mite.

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:05.477
Dy-no-mite.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.479
Creeping me out.

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:14.986
Look at this.

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.969
Does a bear shit in the woods?

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:43.265
Hey. Does a bear shit in the woods?

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:45.725
My cell phone. Where did you find that?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:47.727
Does a bear shit in the woods?

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.188
-Usually.
-Unbelievable.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:51.773
I gotta make a quick call, all right?

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.817
-Who you gonna call?
-Ghostbusters?

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.151
Denise.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:01.491
Hi. Jerry and Denise
are no longer doing it.

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:04.744
If you need Denise, call her on her cell.

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:13.253
It's killing time!

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:15.672
Come on, Jerry, get down.

01:17:29.729 --> 01:17:33.023
Hey, come on, now. Give me a hand.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.818
Every time I get comfortable.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.988
Listen up. Go due north
till you get to the top of the ridge,

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.449
then you go directly west.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:44.075
-Okay.
-Just keep going,

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.036
you'll come to an old mining trail.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.997
Follow that right down
to the bottom of the mountain.

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:50.332
All right.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.251
You go right, I go left.

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:55.503
-Okay.
-I love this part.

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:57.505
-Come on.
-He say left or right?

01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.674
Have a good life, boys.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:08.099
-Let's go.
-Go, go, go, go!

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:24.074
When you peckerwoods
get your diapers clean, come on back.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.950
I'll be waiting.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:31.122
-West is this way.
-We're not going west.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:33.375
Yes, we are. The compass says so.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.543
Well, this compass
came out of a cereal box,

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.087
so why are we running the wrong way?

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:38.671
Iron. Iron.

01:18:38.756 --> 01:18:39.839
What?

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:42.592
Iron ore. There's iron in the hills.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:44.010
It's throwing off the magnet.

01:18:44.095 --> 01:18:46.221
Tell Mr. Wizard that
we're still going the wrong way.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.139
Which means Del's compass,
it wouldn't work here.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:50.975
If D.B. was supposed to land three
degrees northwest of Devil's Ridge,

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.186
it would've come off as directly west.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:54.354
Who cares about D.B.?

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:57.315
Which means he would've landed
somewhere...

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:05.240
Oh, my throat, neck, chest.

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:11.329
Guys, I think we found him.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.166
Jesus.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:30.306
This is him. This is D.B. Cooper.

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:33.476
It has to be.
The parachute and the briefcase.

01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:37.230
He must have broke his legs in the
landing and then stumbled in this hole.

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:38.481
You poor bastard.

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:40.733
Del was looking for him,
but it was winter.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.903
And the snow must have covered up
the top there.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:49.409
-We found him.
-That's him.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:50.785
-I can't believe we did it.
-D.B. Cooper.

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.454
Who else would it be?

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:54.622
This case is empty. The money's gone.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.876
No, look. Look what he's holding.

01:20:01.589 --> 01:20:03.631
He burnt the cash to stay warm.

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:07.969
He traded every dollar
for just a few more hours of life.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:10.180
So much for the treasure.

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:12.098
No, that's it.

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:16.394
Being alive, that's the treasure.

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:18.813
Here he is, boys,

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:21.816
the great D.B. Cooper and his treasure.

01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:26.863
And we found it, so we get our most
valuable possessions back.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:30.366
Yeah.

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:35.997
Gentlemen.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:52.764
Time to leave this stuff behind
and get the hell home.

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.475
Come on, Elwood.

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:02.690
Well, boss? What's the plan now?

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:04.692
First we gotta find our way out
of this hellhole,

01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:06.986
-and then we make a run for it.
-No.

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:10.865
No more running.
After everything we've been through,

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.245
Dr. Mott has finally run out of things
to be afraid of.

01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:20.625
Do you hear that? I'm not scared
of you, you Neanderthal dicks!

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.043
Okay, okay.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.962
We got it, we got it, all right?

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:26.297
Hey, look, there's light coming
from over there.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:30.134
-What is that, a tunnel?
-Yeah, maybe it leads out of here.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:34.681
We're never getting through there, Tom.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:39.769
-Dano?
-No.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.563
No. No way.

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:43.481
What happened to the badass
over there?

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:47.235
What happened to running out
of things to be afraid of?

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:51.322
That was... This is just
a small, dark space, you know.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:53.908
I can't. I can't, it's a deal-breaker.

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:56.035
This could lead out of here.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.997
Dan, you're the only one
small enough to go through.

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:00.873
That's what she said.

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:07.922
It's... It's a mine shaft.
They had to get the ore out somehow.

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:11.759
-It's our only chance, Dano.
-Come on, prairie dog.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:13.344
You can do it.

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:17.890
I don't think that's helping.

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:20.184
Okay.

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:23.938
Come on.

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:25.857
Let's get him like this and slide him in.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:37.243
Keep going, buddy.

01:22:37.328 --> 01:22:40.455
Keep going. There's gotta be light.
Do you see light?

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.540
I don't think I can.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.917
I don't think I can.

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:48.713
Come on, Dan.
Soothing songs from the past.

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:54.093
-Do you really want to hurt me?
-Do you really want to hurt me?

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:58.973
-Do you really want to make me cry?
-...make me cry?

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.480
Precious kisses
Words that burn me

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:08.816
Lovers never ask you why

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:13.071
-Do you really want to hurt me?
-Do you really want to hurt me?

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:14.364
Come on, Dano!

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:18.660
Do you really want to make me cry?

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:20.745
Quiet.

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:26.292
...burn me
Lovers never ask you why

01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:28.753
-The hills have gone gay.
-No, no.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.546
It's Culture Club.

01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:33.716
I had a new wave phase.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:39.931
Lovers never ask you why

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:44.519
-Do you really...
-Do you really want to hurt me?

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:46.688
...wanna hurt me?

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:51.776
Do you really want to make me cry?

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:56.989
Yes, we really wanna hurt you

01:23:57.074 --> 01:24:01.285
Yes, we really wanna make you cry

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:05.665
Precious kisses
Words that burn me

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.417
Lovers never ask you...

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.171
How you like me now?

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.551
Well, well, well.
We got you, little city boys.

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:17.844
We sure got you.

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:20.221
I think this is just a misunderstanding.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:23.766
-That was quite a run you gave us.
-You ain't running nowhere now.

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:25.143
What am I doing?

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:26.561
-The game's up.
-Hold on, Dennis.

01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:28.646
I have a wonderful idea.

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:31.774
Can I use this, please?

01:24:31.859 --> 01:24:35.945
Elwood, that is the best idea
you have had, ever.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:38.197
We got you now.

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:49.542
How you like me now?

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:53.004
Good work, Dan.

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:57.550
Watch out!

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:04.849
You got them, guys!

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.609
Elwood, you all right?

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:20.615
Good one, Jerry. You're awesome!

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:22.784
Stop cheerleading and help, man!

01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:24.368
-Right.
-Get them, Elwood.

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:27.246
-Get him off me.
-Hey. There's a grenade up here.

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:28.873
No!

01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:33.085
No biting. No biting!

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:03.991
Gun.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:21.175
Sheriff! Sheriff. Thank God you're here.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.510
My friends are in that hole.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:25.429
And these guys are down there beating
them up. And these are their guns.

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:28.307
They got us in this hole.

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:31.143
Having a spot of trouble,
are you, city slickers?

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:33.855
Sheriff. I never thought I'd be happy
to see you again.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.690
Give me that.

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.568
Hey, hey. Fight's over, fellas.

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:41.153
Come on, Jer. Come on.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:46.284
-Good work, Dano.
-You, too. I can't believe we made it.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:47.952
Not quite.

01:26:48.579 --> 01:26:52.164
All right, ladies, on your feet.
Let's get this over with.

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:56.210
Jesus, Hank. We were scared
you was never gonna come.

01:26:56.295 --> 01:26:59.005
-Oh, I scared you, did I? I scared you?
-Yeah, you did.

01:26:59.089 --> 01:27:00.214
It's all about you, isn't it, Elwood?

01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:03.593
-These boys have been running all over.
-Well, it's a damn good thing I got here.

01:27:03.677 --> 01:27:07.096
You two been shooting up this
goddamn mountain for three days,

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.098
chasing these jag-offs.

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:13.352
Nice racket, sheriff. What,
do you get a cut of the weed profits?

01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:16.898
Profits? They work for me, ass-wipe.

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:18.941
What are you gonna tell our families?
I mean, you can't...

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:21.611
You can't exactly explain this away.

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:23.154
Explaining?

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.990
We don't have to explain anything.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:30.453
It's just three more city boys
got lost on the river, that's all.

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:33.581
Hey, I bet they got eaten up
by scavengers.

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:35.249
-It's a terrible shame.
-Dano.

01:27:35.334 --> 01:27:37.168
-Case closed.
-Let's shoot them.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.629
I wanna shoot the little redhead one
right there.

01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:42.548
Now, look, I'm tired of talking.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.385
Let's get this done with.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.888
Over the edge you go, boys.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:50.014
-Wait!
-Shut up.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.016
Wait, Sheriff. Wait, wait, wait.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.267
Okay, Sheriff,
I'm gonna shoot them now.

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:56.395
No, no, no. Well, let's listen to this.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.730
Look,

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:01.776
you and I,
we're cut from the same cloth.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.070
I mean, we're a lot alike,
don't you think?

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:08.950
Yeah, sure, I'm better with numbers
and I bathe often.

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:13.746
I have a dental plan that's allowed me
to keep all my teeth, unlike yourself.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.960
-Yeah?
-I learned a little something

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:22.922
the last couple days, getting chased
by ass-face and dick-chin there.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.632
And that is,

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:27.593
I have two of the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.

01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:30.346
I've got the love of a good woman.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:34.308
I've got a really good life.
I mean, I've got an amazing life.

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:39.647
And I've decided that my life's
worth living. Now, you have to decide

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:43.484
if your life's worth living, too,
because if it is,

01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:45.987
you put your gun down.

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:47.697
And if we don't?

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.994
-Bye, bye, boys.
-It's go time.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:55.955
-Let's do this thing!
-Put the pin back in the grenade.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:57.707
That is my grenade, sir.

01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:01.460
The plan was for me to sacrifice myself
if need be while you two ran for it.

01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:03.170
-I didn't know.
-That's my grenade...

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:06.424
-I'm not a mind reader, Jerry.
-Give me back my grenade.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.013
Run!

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.265
It's gonna blow!

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.153
All right, that's it. You're dead.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:30.072
When all this is over, someone's
buying the first round. Not it.

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:32.700
-Not it.
-Enough of this shit. Just shoot them.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:35.411
Do you think there's beer in heaven?

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.080
I was thinking more
about the bar in town.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:04.023
-Let's get off this mountain.
-All right.

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:12.239
These charges are unsubstantialated
and injustifigurable and...

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:15.242
That's right. We did it.
How you like me now?

01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:17.870
This is the scene here
at police headquarters

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:21.957
as three local heroes
emerge to a cheering crowd.

01:30:22.042 --> 01:30:25.169
The men accidentally helped break up
one of the biggest drug rings

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:29.256
in state history while hiking
in a remote section of the Cascades.

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:31.842
My old man would not believe this.

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:34.804
-Billy wouldn't believe it.
-Actually, know what?

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:36.555
I think he would.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.267
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this ensemble. I like it.

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:42.061
-Look at you.
-Thank you, boys.

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:44.563
Look at this stud. Del!

01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:46.524
No names. Fuzz.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:51.362
Glad I caught you guys before you
headed out. I got something for you.

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:53.405
What's this?

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.575
-D.B.'s parachute. Are you sure?
-Damn sure.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.786
There's a little something for you
rolled up inside there, too.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.871
-Thank you.
-So, where you headed?

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:04.458
Thought I'd see the world.
I might even hit Washington.

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:07.461
Wow. One state over.

01:31:07.546 --> 01:31:10.798
Till I do, I'm just telling tall tales.

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:19.265
Remember, carry your friends
wherever you go.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:22.143
Close to your heart.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:25.855
Or on your back.
I got D.B.'s bones in my satchel.

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:28.566
Thought I'd give him a proper burial.

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:32.444
I spent 30 years waiting to have a life.

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:38.993
-What the hell?
-Oh, my gosh.

01:31:39.077 --> 01:31:40.494
Oh, my God.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.956
D.B. didn't burn it all.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.292
He couldn't. It was Del's share.

01:31:46.376 --> 01:31:48.377
There's gotta be 100 grand in here.

01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:51.005
We'll split it three ways.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:53.841
One-third, one-third, one-third?

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:55.551
You know what?

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:59.513
No, thanks. I'm...

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:01.056
-I'm good.
-I'm not good.

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:02.850
You guys split it.

01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:05.936
You wanna split it? Fifty-fifty?

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.856
Actually, I can't.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:12.401
Because I bet you 100 grand
that you couldn't catch a salmon

01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:14.528
with a flashlight and I lost.

01:32:14.613 --> 01:32:18.991
Besides, Tom, you got bills to pay.
You got a new life to start.

01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:21.243
I don't know what to say.

01:32:21.328 --> 01:32:23.245
Just say we're square.

01:32:24.164 --> 01:32:27.458
No, actually, we're not square.

01:32:28.585 --> 01:32:32.504
I seem to recall a certain part
of that wager being one left nut,

01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:35.132
and I'm gonna get it.
Come on, pleated pants, let's go.

01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:37.843
-Hey, Tom. Hey. Hey.
-Oh, no.

01:32:37.928 --> 01:32:39.220
Don't make me go in through the throat.

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:41.222
-I'm going through the throat.
-You said I could keep it.

01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:43.766
-No, I didn't.
-Tom, you said I could keep it.

01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:45.392
Jerry! Officer!

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.647
Hi. This is Jerry, and I can't
come to the phone right now

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:52.942
because I am busy trying
to convince the love of my life

01:32:53.026 --> 01:32:54.235
to give me another chance.

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:56.862
And I will prove to her
that I grew up just enough

01:32:56.947 --> 01:33:00.074
to know that I want the responsibility,
day in and day out,

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:02.284
of being there for her
in this relationship,

01:33:02.369 --> 01:33:05.996
which I am hoping will someday
become marriage and kids

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:09.625
and a long and unbelievably
happy life together.

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:11.126
Hi, honey.

01:33:36.069 --> 01:33:37.945
So happy right now.

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:42.700
That was really, really beautiful.

01:33:48.498 --> 01:33:51.667
-Will you get the light, hon?
-Oh, yeah.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:57.006
You're so good at that now.

01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:03.220
And then I jumped on the grenade
to save my buddies and...

01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:05.639
Blew my ribcage all to shit.

01:34:05.724 --> 01:34:08.017
Sent me 156 feet in the air.

01:34:08.101 --> 01:34:12.396
Then I went back and paid off
all my debts in full with D.B.'s money.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:16.734
One question.

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:20.986
What's a downstairs?

01:34:21.305 --> 01:34:27.334
