No way.

09:48.350 --> 09:49.670
Keri.

09:49.820 --> 09:52.000
Get in.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.330
Who's the kid?

09:59.590 --> 10:02.470
I don't know. I was just 
walking out of my house,

10:02.500 --> 10:04.960
turned my back, and the
next second he was there.

10:04.990 --> 10:06.770
Like magic almost.

10:07.000 --> 10:07.980
Really?

10:08.010 --> 10:10.110
Yeah, really.

10:12.580 --> 10:15.910
Seemed familiar to me.
What did he want?

10:15.910 --> 10:16.810
Nothing.

10:16.810 --> 10:17.840
He's new in town.

10:18.430 --> 10:22.130
You know you can get killed riding

10:22.150 --> 10:23.950

10:24.930 --> 10:26.010
You're mine.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.990
And I'll do anything necessary
to keep it that way.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.770
You think you own me... That
somehow I'm your private property.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.980
You are. Nobody loves
you as much as I do.

11:02.190 --> 11:06.260
It's because everybody's
scared of you.

11:06.260 --> 11:08.730
If you're not going
to be my girl,

11:08.730 --> 11:12.070
you're not going

11:44.430 --> 11:45.900
Look, do you mind
if I lay my towel here?

11:45.900 --> 11:47.730
I ain't welcome over there.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.870
Why ain't I welcome?
Or it's ok to lay here?

11:51.870 --> 11:54.710

12:13.040 --> 12:15.060

12:15.060 --> 12:17.460

good friends.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.870
Well, actually she's...

12:18.870 --> 12:22.100
She used to be tight
with my brother.

12:22.100 --> 12:26.170
She's got real problems with that
lunatic she's with there now.

12:27.710 --> 12:29.010
What kind of problems?

12:29.710 --> 12:31.810
Well, Packard's
a mistake of nature...

12:31.810 --> 12:33.450
A genetic misfire.

12:33.450 --> 12:34.750
He's what?

12:34.750 --> 12:36.120
Packard gets crazy jealous

12:36.120 --> 12:38.520
if anybody even looks
at Keri cross-eyed.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.920
You got to wear dark glasses
so he doesn't catch you at it.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.130
That includes your brother,
I assume, right?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.340
My brother Jamie?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.160
The guy you were
just talking about.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.200
He's dead.

12:55.550 --> 12:58.020
He was murdered
up on the Willow River.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.410
But nobody ever knew who did it.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.780

18:20.480 --> 18:23.230
I need one cheese, 2 Big Kays...

18:23.260 --> 18:26.430
I got a cowboy out there
wants 2 burgers, rare.

18:26.430 --> 18:27.500
And I mean rare!

18:27.530 --> 18:30.400
Honey, You'll have it so rare that 
a good veterinarian will have them

18:30.400 --> 18:32.170
back on their feet

Sure.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.300
Good. This thing
runs best

18:44.330 --> 18:45.670
when I have a good navigator.

18:45.690 --> 18:48.690
That is if I can get
the beast to start.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.860
Come on, you goof.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.820
Hey, it's the fumes
off the grill, Keri.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.800
It hurts my mind.

18:53.830 --> 18:54.730
Ah, come on!

18:54.730 --> 18:56.600
Oh, God, it's him.
Hurry up.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.200
I'm tryin'. Tryin'!

18:58.200 --> 19:00.300
Hurry up!
Uhh!

19:04.430 --> 19:06.800
Oh, man.

19:14.260 --> 19:15.580
Hello, Keri.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.010
Looks like I got here
just in time.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.230
You...
In the car.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.220
I mean now.

19:23.770 --> 19:25.980
Hey, listen, Pack, I was
just on my way out, too.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.400
Hold your horses, guy.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.160
Packard, please.

19:31.030 --> 19:32.430
Just get in the car
for a minute.

19:32.550 --> 19:35.270
I just want to speak
to Billy alone.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.840
Help her out.

19:45.990 --> 19:47.590
So what happened here?

19:47.960 --> 19:51.420
Looks to me like you ran out of those
all-beef patties kind of early today, huh?

19:51.480 --> 19:53.130
Hey, don't worry, Pack.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.690
We still got plenty of dog food.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.440
Hey, Packard, let's
grind up some meat, huh?

19:57.460 --> 20:01.470
Is he just a
naturally gifted child?

20:02.230 --> 20:04.310
I swear to God.
I'll rip your head off...

20:04.650 --> 20:09.150
Hold your water, Oggie.
This is business.

20:12.680 --> 20:13.960
Nothing personal, guy.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.690
That's a nice car you have here.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.170
Now where were you going
with my girl?

20:19.370 --> 20:21.870
I was just giving her a ride home, man.
Give me a break.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.520
Hey, Rughead...

20:24.280 --> 20:25.590
What's this Triumph worth?

20:26.270 --> 20:27.550
You're not getting it, Packard!

20:28.250 --> 20:29.610
You're not taking it.

20:29.910 --> 20:31.430
Who said anything
about taking it?

20:31.980 --> 20:35.630
I didn't say nothing.
I know I didn't.

20:35.690 --> 20:36.760
I tell you what.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.820
I'm going to give you the same
chance I give everybody else.

20:40.930 --> 20:43.160
We're gonna race for it.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.030
Look, Pack,
you don't get my car.

20:46.290 --> 20:48.110
And if you're not nice
you're not going to get your burgers

20:48.140 --> 20:51.410
with the Mayo and Thousand
Island the way you love 'em.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.690
Billy, I thought
you understood me.

20:55.820 --> 20:58.550
This isn't a negotiation.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.830
Rugs...

21:09.290 --> 21:10.850
You ever seen
one of those before?

21:10.980 --> 21:13.900
Nah, let's just add it
to our collection first.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.840
We can figure out
what it is second.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.170
We'll continue this
discussion later,

21:19.170 --> 21:21.210
and I'll enjoy it.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.840
I'll see you later, eh, faggot?

21:31.970 --> 21:33.450
Hey, Packard, I think
he's going to Sandy Bar.

21:33.450 --> 21:34.420
Let me take him this time!

21:34.420 --> 21:36.090
All right, it's your turn, dude.

21:36.090 --> 21:38.820
Let's go!
All right!

22:00.530 --> 22:03.380
All right, I want you
to tear this guy a new asshole.

22:03.460 --> 22:06.280
Do it to him Oggie-style.

22:06.310 --> 22:07.480
I'll burn this iranian.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.600
Ok, the first to
Rattler's crossing wins!

22:12.020 --> 22:13.390
You lose the race,

22:13.390 --> 22:15.490
you lose your car.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.630
Agreed?

22:18.010 --> 22:20.640
Stay on your side
of the road, man.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.470
Ok, let's get it on!

22:26.640 --> 22:28.040
Send them off!

22:28.040 --> 22:29.010
Say what?

22:29.010 --> 22:30.480
I said send them off!

22:30.480 --> 22:33.210
Take the Willow River
cut-off.

22:33.210 --> 22:35.150
Ready!

22:36.150 --> 22:39.050
Set!

22:40.290 --> 22:42.220
Go!

25:32.990 --> 25:34.330
Uh, Roger that,
Murphy.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.190
Paramedics have been notified,

25:36.200 --> 25:38.530
they are on their way.

25:41.260 --> 25:43.970
- You think he made it?
- You gotta be kidding me.

25:44.030 --> 25:46.700
- Local kid?
- He used to be.

25:47.570 --> 25:49.390
Call the meat wagon,
then get a hold of Loomis,

25:49.410 --> 25:53.260
tell him we got a possible
D.O.A. up here.

25:54.810 --> 25:56.660
Loomis, we got
a snuffed kid up here

25:56.680 --> 26:00.320
at Muletail Coulee.
It's Oggie Fisher.

26:07.050 --> 26:09.070
Uh, Roger that,
this is Stokes, Murphy.

26:09.100 --> 26:13.700
We, uh, just saw a paramedic
down at the cut-off...

26:19.320 --> 26:22.230
I've been waiting to catch
you guys in the act.

26:22.260 --> 26:24.780
I've been waiting and watching.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.380
Congratulations.

26:26.380 --> 26:28.210
You caught us talking.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.450
There's no law against
that, is there, officer?

26:30.480 --> 26:32.510
Unless, of course,
I got my wires crossed

26:32.540 --> 26:34.290
and you caught us
speaking without a per...

26:34.290 --> 26:35.630
Clam it, wise guy!

26:35.660 --> 26:38.500
There's a dead kid
3 Miles up the highway.

26:40.050 --> 26:42.500
Yeah, that's right. Dead.

26:42.630 --> 26:46.700
Run off the highway and killed.

26:53.870 --> 26:55.600
Ok, pal.

26:55.960 --> 26:58.160
Time to drain the drug overdose

26:58.190 --> 26:59.830
sloshing above your eyebrows

26:59.850 --> 27:02.280
and tell me who the dude was
driving that other car.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.150
With all due respect, sir...

27:05.150 --> 27:07.120
If you're putting us
under arrest,

27:07.120 --> 27:10.590
I do believe we have
right to counsel.

27:20.470 --> 27:23.070
What about you, maggot, huh?
You got anything to say,

27:23.100 --> 27:25.740
or are your veins bloated
with brain eradicator, too?

27:25.880 --> 27:28.670
Yeah, well, who got killed?

27:28.680 --> 27:31.310
Oggie Fisher.

27:31.310 --> 27:34.460
And there isn't enough left of him
to stick it in a cigar box

27:34.910 --> 27:40.180
Hey, Loomis, I think
you ought to see this!

27:44.390 --> 27:45.590
Oh, Murphy, what for?

27:45.590 --> 27:48.560
I think you should see this.

27:52.530 --> 27:56.370
Oh, that's ugly.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.770
Kid ought to be dog meat.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.770
Wait a minute.

28:00.770 --> 28:02.240
Yeah, Loomis,

28:02.240 --> 28:04.340
this kid smashed down a canyon

28:04.340 --> 28:06.440
through fire and bustin' glass.

28:06.450 --> 28:09.410
Must have been
1,000 degrees in that car.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.780
Uh-huh. At least.

28:10.780 --> 28:12.280
Where's his eyes?

28:12.290 --> 28:13.790
Sent cats climbing up my spine

28:13.790 --> 28:15.650
when I saw them
hauling this corpse

28:15.660 --> 28:16.760
out of that canyon.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.820
Clean, as if he come
out of a hot tub.

28:19.830 --> 28:23.600
I'm worried, Loomis.
Something ain't right.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.700
Well...

28:24.700 --> 28:28.230
Get him into town
and box him up.

28:28.240 --> 28:32.240
I've still got a few rocks
to turn over up here.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.610
All right, load him up.

28:39.580 --> 28:42.650
You don't even want to know
what I just saw, asswipe.

28:42.650 --> 28:45.620
Now spill it. Who was
driving that other car?

28:45.620 --> 28:47.920
Nobody ever saw it before.

28:47.920 --> 28:50.420
Wasn't a local car.
It was...

28:50.420 --> 28:52.420
it was customized or something.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.460
Yeah, it was like
a V-Dub conversion

28:54.460 --> 29:00.500
and a surf-rack on top.
Oh, it was awesome, man.

29:02.030 --> 29:04.600
Well, no one seems
to be too broken up

29:04.610 --> 29:06.470
about Mr. Fisher
laying there,

29:06.470 --> 29:09.460
splayed out to 4 points
of the compass.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.280
But, then again,
maybe that's what things

29:12.280 --> 29:13.550
have come down to, huh?

29:13.550 --> 29:16.250
Deputy Halifax over there
is gonna take down

29:16.250 --> 29:17.520
a list of names for me,

29:17.520 --> 29:19.250
so if any of you guys
are planning on

29:19.250 --> 29:21.290
taking a vacation
in the next few days,

29:21.290 --> 29:22.490
you can just forget it.

29:22.490 --> 29:26.320
I'll be visiting you
again with warrants,

29:26.330 --> 29:28.860
Mr. Attorney.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.530
Ok, Halifax, they're all yours.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.400
Oggie Fisher.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.750
They got us all.
Let's cruise.

29:53.750 --> 29:54.790
Yo, Gutterboy!

29:54.790 --> 29:55.750
What, Skank?

29:55.760 --> 29:56.480
Let's jam.

29:56.510 --> 29:57.720
Yo, Rugs.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.390
That kid in the Daytona

29:59.390 --> 30:01.030
gave me a hell
of a run last night.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.110
If I hadn't tried to kill him,
he might beat me.

30:04.750 --> 30:07.030
When's the new injection
plant going to be ready?

30:07.060 --> 30:09.810
Tonight, maybe?
Maybe tomorrow.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.810
The digital radio killers,
they're almost ready, too.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.810
Good. The sooner
the better.

30:14.810 --> 30:16.810
Things are getting a little

30:16.810 --> 30:19.680
too equal these days.

30:19.950 --> 30:22.510
Sure, Packard.

30:28.330 --> 30:31.180
Hey. Hey!

30:31.860 --> 30:34.630
What seems to be the problem?

30:36.630 --> 30:40.770
I just can't believe
that Oggie's dead.

30:41.570 --> 30:45.770
I mean, he lived just
up the street from me.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.910
I just can't believe it.

30:48.910 --> 30:51.980
Oggie's no loss, believe me.

30:52.610 --> 30:53.950
Now, tell me something.

30:53.950 --> 30:56.610
What were you doing with
Billy Hankins today?

30:56.620 --> 30:59.520
I was tired.
I decided to go home.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.590
Don't lie to me.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.620
I love you too much
for you to lie.

31:04.620 --> 31:07.790
I'm not lying, Packard.

31:07.790 --> 31:09.960
You and me...

31:10.630 --> 31:13.670
We're like blood brothers.

31:20.390 --> 31:21.910
I guess you could call us

31:21.910 --> 31:24.110
blood lovers...

31:24.760 --> 31:27.760
Because that's how
much I love you.

31:35.590 --> 31:36.990
And when you love someone

31:36.990 --> 31:38.090
as much as I love you,

31:38.090 --> 31:41.590
after a while, you feel nothing.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.470
And when you feel nothing,

31:49.470 --> 31:52.070
you can do anything.

32:00.510 --> 32:04.550
I don't love you.

32:04.630 --> 32:08.000
I've never made love to you.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.330
I never will.

32:11.510 --> 32:14.010
You will.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.740
Hey, Rug.
How we doing

32:28.770 --> 32:30.680
on the digital radio killer?

32:30.680 --> 32:31.980
It's tits, man.

32:31.980 --> 32:33.140
It's totally functional.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.850
Yeah, what about
the injection plant?

32:34.850 --> 32:35.910
Oh, it's ready.

32:35.920 --> 32:36.820
It's ready?

32:36.820 --> 32:40.120
It'll blow away anything
this side of the Mississippi.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.450
Good. Now all
we have to do

32:42.460 --> 32:43.590
is fit it in the 'Vette.

32:43.610 --> 32:45.590
I can fit this thing
in a Go-Cart,

32:45.590 --> 32:47.030
what are you worried about?

32:53.730 --> 32:56.000
When this thing
gonna be chopped?

32:56.690 --> 32:58.640
Tomorrow morn... morning.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.940
Tonight.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.010
You got that, Gutterboy?

33:02.010 --> 33:04.110
Yeah, ok.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.530
What about those, uh...

33:11.550 --> 33:13.140
Yeah, Packard, I got
those elbow parts

33:13.160 --> 33:15.650
sold to the Nagoles boys
for 2,900 bucks.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.560
Yeah, that old guy was
pretty pissed off.

33:38.490 --> 33:40.080
Look, guy...

33:40.400 --> 33:44.960
Loomis is out there
looking to bust everyone.

33:45.870 --> 33:48.640
I mean, losing Oggie
ain't no big deal,

33:48.660 --> 33:51.660
and that's a hell
of a car you got there.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.880
Buddy, I'd put that kidney 
buster down if I was you.

34:00.900 --> 34:04.230
This place is filled with
ether and acetylene, dig?

34:24.530 --> 34:25.739
No!
Hey!

34:25.770 --> 34:29.679
I don't know what
your problem is, guy, but...

34:29.710 --> 34:31.650
Hey!

34:39.980 --> 34:42.310
I'm out of here!

34:57.940 --> 34:59.900
Keep going, man!

35:00.480 --> 35:02.250
Holy shit!

35:37.670 --> 35:39.830
No!

36:06.800 --> 36:09.030
Where'd he go?

36:09.560 --> 36:11.930
Skank, you pussy!

36:12.390 --> 36:14.500
- Skank!
- Yeah?

36:14.530 --> 36:16.040
Who is that guy?

36:16.570 --> 36:21.150
I don't know, but whoever he was,
he's weird and pissed off.

37:06.530 --> 37:07.910
- Red?
- Yeah?

37:07.970 --> 37:09.930
Loomis here.

37:12.490 --> 37:13.770
Hey, Loomis.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.850
This is a real strange
place you got here.

37:16.920 --> 37:20.400
Really unique in its
depressing qualities, huh?

37:20.860 --> 37:23.300
- What do you need?
Bingo.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.070
You got a couple of
cockroaches working here.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.870
I need a word with them.

37:28.010 --> 37:29.340
My nephew Skank

37:29.340 --> 37:31.480
and his pal Gutterboy?
Over there.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.440
Thanks.

37:41.790 --> 37:44.760
Cleared for take off.

37:58.090 --> 37:59.290
Morning, fellas.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.870
Yo, Skank!

38:02.340 --> 38:04.380
This is a nice place
you got out here.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.820
Skank, a little help here?

38:06.850 --> 38:08.330
Been working here long?

38:08.350 --> 38:10.450
Man, I smell a cop!

38:10.480 --> 38:13.050
- Do you smell a cop?
- I smell French fries, Skank.

38:13.050 --> 38:16.020
But that don't make
no sense, huh?

38:19.430 --> 38:21.120
Bud, you got a warrant?

38:21.150 --> 38:23.620
I don't need a warrant
when I have this badge.

38:23.650 --> 38:27.190
But we know our constipational rights, sir.
You can't just come in here and...

38:27.220 --> 38:29.480
Oh, wow!

38:31.570 --> 38:33.570
I got this problem, fellas.

38:33.590 --> 38:36.370
Oggie Fisher, your buddy
who got greased?

38:36.380 --> 38:38.510
I want to know who was
driving the car

38:38.510 --> 38:40.410
that ran him into Kingdome come.

38:40.410 --> 38:43.310
Nobody's seen
that guy before, it's...

38:43.320 --> 38:45.120
you hit me in the head
again, Skank.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.420
I'm telling ya...
ok.

38:46.610 --> 38:48.020
I can't remember dog squeeze

38:48.020 --> 38:49.120
when it comes to getting

38:49.120 --> 38:50.740
run off of roads there, Loomis.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.820
I can see why, Skank.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.830
I can call you Skank, can't I?

38:55.830 --> 38:59.340
Yeah, unless you
like Maurice better.

39:03.980 --> 39:05.910
Well, you listen good, Skank.

39:06.380 --> 39:10.140
I know it's gonna be hard with
your melon on chemical overload.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.440
But there's a killer out there,

39:11.440 --> 39:13.950
and I'm gonna track
the hair ball down,

39:13.950 --> 39:15.380
so when you 2 craterheads

39:15.380 --> 39:17.180
get finished mining
for nose gold,

39:17.200 --> 39:19.260
and you get a relapse of memory,

39:19.290 --> 39:21.380
you let me know, huh?

39:21.520 --> 39:24.460
I'm just a phone call away.

39:35.130 --> 39:38.300
We ain't got no
telephone, Skank.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.300
A little Hydropump?

39:39.310 --> 39:41.070
No!

39:47.950 --> 39:49.110
Here you go.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.310
Oh, thank you, Lisa.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.080
No charge for the sarge.

40:29.990 --> 40:34.060
I want everyone
to stand by, over.

40:37.100 --> 40:40.360
I got an order up
for Mr. Bucky.

40:49.170 --> 40:50.710
So where is he, tuna can?

40:50.710 --> 40:53.480
Dude, we couldn't find
the slimeball anywhere.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.010
Yeah, we went across town,

40:55.010 --> 40:56.980
down to Crawford's Gulley,

40:56.980 --> 40:59.420
and we stopped for
a box of Goobers...

40:59.420 --> 41:01.880
You guys are pissing me off.

41:01.900 --> 41:03.350
I want that faggot.

Yeah, this freak's into us

41:04.990 --> 41:07.060
for about 13,000 bucks.

41:07.060 --> 41:08.260
We spent all last night

41:08.260 --> 41:09.730
banging on the 2 bodies.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.100
I got scabs on my knuckles

41:11.100 --> 41:12.130
and everything like that.

41:12.130 --> 41:14.670
It's your damn job, Gutterboy.

41:14.670 --> 41:16.470
What does he got with us?

41:16.470 --> 41:18.820
What he's got is
an ass full of trouble.

41:19.050 --> 41:22.030
Yeah, its about time we got
into somebody's ass, huh, guys?

41:22.060 --> 41:24.350
Yeah, we'll beat him like
a red-head stepchild.

41:24.450 --> 41:27.240
I'm gonna knock his ass
lower than whale shit.

41:27.250 --> 41:29.310
Where does he go?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.450
I don't know.

41:31.580 --> 41:33.720
But I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch.

41:33.720 --> 41:36.750
Hey, Keri, I'll pick
you up later tonight,

41:36.760 --> 41:40.990
so do yourself a favor
and be here!

41:51.100 --> 41:53.700
He's on Lookout
Mountain Road, let's go!

41:53.710 --> 41:54.710
Whoo!

41:54.710 --> 41:57.270
All right!

42:00.410 --> 42:02.380

we give that yellow ass bastard

43:05.420 --> 43:07.870
a taste of his own medicine.

43:09.900 --> 43:13.040
Skank, why is it you continue
to question my authority?

43:13.070 --> 43:14.070
Come on, man.

43:14.650 --> 43:16.120
You got a big audience

43:16.120 --> 43:17.820

47:11.390 --> 47:15.440
We're coming in at you
at about 100 miles an hour.

47:15.470 --> 47:17.360
Roger that, Murphy,
Halifax has 3 units

47:17.360 --> 47:18.360

the park, Skank.

51:55.940 --> 51:58.780
Yeah? What do you say

to drive so fast?"

53:57.430 --> 53:58.500
And use a gun?"

53:58.500 --> 53:59.930

54:15.380 --> 54:17.480
That's what you do best.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.670

Then I was headed east

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.920
on the back of a motorcycle,

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:40.520
and the driver
was Jamie Hankins.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:44.410
What's strange is
that Jamie's dead.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:48.420

using his car to kill people,

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:57.710
not that it's such a big deal

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.480

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:29.670
I don't know,
except I'm quitting.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.870
And if I was you guys,
I'd quit, too.

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:34.340
Well, I ain't got no beef

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:37.310
Yeah, he's just a damn kid, man!

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:38.609
Packard said so.

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:40.310
I'm leaving!

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:42.279
Too bad!

01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:48.920
Slosh this pig with 15, bud.

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.319
Let's go cruise.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.859
Scare up some poozle some place.

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:54.180
You got it, Skanko,

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:57.359
'cause I'm
a 4-day virgin.

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:16.740
Rughead must have
forgot something.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.080
Kind of a mess now,
don't you think?

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.850
The Gutterboy and Skank...

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.990
They were... they were
right there.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:08.490
And it's like they vaporized!

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:12.190
They were adiosed
by the kid in the Turbo.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.160
I warned 'em!

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:15.900
I warned 'em!

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.370
What are you trying to say, boy?

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:21.370
That Skank and Gutterboy

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.070
were in there
when the place blew.

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:32.250
I know it seems impossible.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.480
I didn't know they had
a kid in the car.

01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:38.520
I didn't know
it was Jamie Hankins

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.390
till he came up missing.

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:41.360
So, what you're telling me

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.090
is that Packard and the others

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:45.230
killed Jamie Hankins?

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:48.130
Jamie Hankins was
here the other night

01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:49.530
with a shotgun!

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:51.400
A dead kid with a shotgun?

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.340
I seen his eyes, Loomis.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.070
I seen his eyes...

01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:58.240
And I got a real bad feeling.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.940
Bad feelings don't add up
to resurrections, buddy.

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:06.150
If it was Jamie Hankins,

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:08.180
why'd they kill him off
in the first place?

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:12.190
I've been too scared
to say nothin'.

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:14.190
Packard hated Jamie.

01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:17.230
Packard hates everybody.
He hates me.

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:18.590
I don't wanna get killed

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.000
over something I had
nothing to do with.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.430
Not now.

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:31.110
You go on home now and...

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:34.280
You stay there till you
hear from me, eh?

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:00.000
Hey, Billy.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.100
Ok, I want 2 dogs.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.440
I want 3, uh, onion rings.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.610
Yeah, 3 orders of onion rings,

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:06.180
and 2 hamburgers, no cheese.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.610
And 2 malteds, vanilla
and chocolate, ok?

01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:11.210
How you doing, kid?

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.320
I'm Officer Loomis.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.480
Can I have a word with you?

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.390
What do you need?
I'm swamped.

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:18.250
I need some information...

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.260
About your brother.

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.920
That's easy.
He's dead.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.160
Order up!

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.430
Yeah, I know.

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:26.280
But, um... His body
never turned up,

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:29.470
and now I've got
4 dead kids in one week.

01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:30.400
4?

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.100
I thought it was 2.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.140
Skank and Gutterboy

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.010
got lunched
out at the warehouse.

01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:42.080
I figure Packard Walsh is next.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.090
I'll shake the hand
of the guys who does it.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.010
Order up!

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.580
It might be, um...

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.480
Impossible.

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.150
Did your, uh...

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.690
Brother have a girl?

01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:53.120
Well, the night he was killed,

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.390
he was with Keri Johnson.

01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:58.430
Somebody busted in
and smashed her head.

01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:59.430
She woke up the next day

01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:01.030
on a deserted highway somewhere

01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:02.330
wrapped in a navajo blanket.

01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:04.470
Does she have any idea
who did it?

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:06.240
Uh, drifters maybe?

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.540
Maybe smugglers?

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.940
Maybe Packard Walsh?

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.180
Who knows?

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.440
She never knew who did it,

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.210
or she would have said so.

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.880
Keri Johnson, huh?

01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:24.910
I need some more relish
over here.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:25.930
Thanks.

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:27.220
Order up.

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.960
Hey, uh, officer?

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.430
What's my brother have
to do with 4 dead guys?

01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:34.030
I mean, what's the connection?

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.310
That's what I'm gonna find out.

Keri.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.040
Now just is not the time
to confront Packard.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.340
Well, if you don't say something
soon, you're gonna be his prisoner

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.950
for a long time.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.310
Who are you?

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:22.180
Ask Packard.

01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:24.450
Packard?

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.480
He knows why I'm here.

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:31.540
See, I've come
a long ways for you.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.120

Got an order up for Gabrielle.
There you go.

01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:19.010
Here you go.
Anything else?

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.130
Yeah, could I have a...

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:22.630
I can't talk now, Packard,
I'm busy.

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.210
The past couple of days.
You've been real busy.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.810
Would you get out
of here? I have to work.

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:28.580
Nope.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:31.310
What are you doing?
Packard, stop it!

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.770
What are you doing? Stop it!

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.210
Get in the car.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.530
Packard, what the hell
are you doing, man?

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.170
Get out of my face, burger boy or 
you'll wind up dead like your brother.

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.010
Billy.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.500
You bastard chickenshits!

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.300
You let him take her!

01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:32.910
So where are we going?

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:36.400
Somewhere no one
will ever find us.

01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:38.460
Where's that, Packard?

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:39.680
West.

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.180
California.

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.810
To Santa Barbara
or some place like that.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.720
I'm not going.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.260
Yes, you are, Keri.

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:55.350
Remember that night when you guys
found me with Jamie Hankins?

01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:58.430
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.570
Well, think.

01:17:59.570 --> 01:18:03.470
When you broke in and
we had just finished doing it.

01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:11.650
So it was you.

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:13.650
Yeah.

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:17.850
I was always with Jamie.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.420
I never made
any promises to you.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.260
You're mine, that's it.

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:26.900
You think I'd go
to California with you?

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:27.930
I'd rather go to Nogales,

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:30.600
have the Gutterboy's
cretin children,

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.570
and die than to be with you.

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:35.490
You better shut up now,
Keri, or I gonna have...

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.960
Yeah, you can
kill me, too, Packard,

01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:41.640
but you can never
make me love you.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.940
Packard, you're pathetic.

01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:07.800
You wanna race?
'Cause I'll show you a race!

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:11.150
We'll finish this later.

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.640
We got 'em, Loomis.
We're in pursuit, over.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.690
All units, we're on Diamondback.

01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:10.530
Request all addition units
in the vicinity.

01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:16.260
We have a suspect heading
westbound on Ridge Road.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.370
Dispatch, we're
in high-speed pursuit

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:20.440
of silver Corvette,

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.040
red trim and that black Turbo.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.810
Uh, Roger, unit 64,

01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:28.040
give us your location
again. Go ahead.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.810
Come in, Loomis.

01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:32.710
North on Diamondback Road.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.550
Uh, Roger that, 16.
North on Diamondback.

01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:51.730
Oh, shit!

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.130
My God.

01:23:58.550 --> 01:24:00.890
Just like all the others.

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:05.200
Loomis, there's only
one body here.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.740
Cover him up.

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.540
You want us to set up
a new road block?

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.540
We could still catch the bugger.

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.710
Got guys waiting...

01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:15.040
Forget it, Murphy.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:19.010
Roadblocks won't stop
something that can't be stopped.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.280
Loomis, what are you saying?

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:22.920
I'm saying it's over.

01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:26.860
There's nobody left
in Packard's gang to kill.

01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:33.270
Let's clean this mess up
and get the hell out of here.

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:10.510
I can't do that again.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.060
Jake.

01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:16.780
You know who I am.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.370
Jamie.

01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:26.870
It's as close as I could 
come to who I once was.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.920
It's close enough.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.160
Just think of this
as a second chance.

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.660
We were meant to be
together, Keri.

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:38.360
Look, I got one
more thing to do.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.360
Don't leave me again.

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.260
Don't worry.
I'll be back.

01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.070
It's a short trip.

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:47.200
Pack light.

01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:11.790
Come on, Packard!

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.430
Relax.

01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:14.730
You scared me, man!

01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:16.700
I'm sorry, man.

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.270
It's been a heavy day already.

01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:21.770
I can see that.

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.870
It's time for me
to hit the road.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.280
My business here is finished.
