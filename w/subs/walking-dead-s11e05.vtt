WEBVTT

00:07.924 --> 00:09.509
How much farther, Daddy?

00:09.592 --> 00:11.636
Well, we, uh, took a wrong turn

00:11.720 --> 00:13.138
at the fork a ways back.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.515
But, uh, we're heading the right way now.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.891
We're almost home.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.518
I'll be glad when we get there.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.687
-Yeah, me, too.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.188
-Daddy?
-It's okay.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.158
You lost?

00:35.535 --> 00:37.120
I'm scared.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.081
It's gonna be okay.
Just stay close.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.486
Gracie?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.321
Gracie?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.947
Gracie!

01:13.490 --> 01:15.158
Gracie!

01:15.742 --> 01:17.160
Gracie!

01:17.243 --> 01:18.995
Gracie!

01:25.376 --> 01:26.836
Stop!

02:23.143 --> 02:24.435
Dudes...

02:24.519 --> 02:26.437
Dudes? Dudes!

02:26.729 --> 02:28.439
Breach!
They're inside the wall!

02:28.523 --> 02:29.691
Breach!

02:29.816 --> 02:32.068
Grab your weapons!

02:32.152 --> 02:34.821
-Daddy?
-There's a breach!

02:34.904 --> 02:38.074
Hey, Gracie, uh, I need you
to head downstairs

02:38.158 --> 02:39.576
into the basement
and don't let anyone in, okay?

02:39.659 --> 02:41.161
Just like we practiced, alright?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.288
And you stay there, okay?
You have your whistle?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.622
Okay.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.499
Okay, go now.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.802
Get 'em back!

02:57.886 --> 03:00.054
Use the beams!

03:02.265 --> 03:03.433
Fill the hole!

03:08.396 --> 03:09.564
Fill the hole!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.706
That's it!

05:01.676 --> 05:03.011
<i>Hello!</i>

05:03.094 --> 05:04.387

06:23.383 --> 06:26.135
Pamela Milton?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.345
Wow.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.773
"Eugene Porter.
Work Detail, high-school teaching pool.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.318
"Boarding Detail, Bungalow 13,
Sector 1..."

06:42.402 --> 06:44.487
Yes! Okay.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.115
This is a good sign.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.534
Pardon my gazing of
a gift horse in the gullet,

06:49.617 --> 06:51.828
but what in the heck are
these details meant to convey?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.871
Job assignments and housing.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.165
Permanent residency here
was not our intent.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.500
If you have a problem with it,

06:57.583 --> 06:59.335
take it up with the case supervisor.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.754
Wait.
What jobs did you guys get?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.548
Doesn't matter.
We're not here to work.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.216
-We're here to get help.
-Uh, totally.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.969
I-I was just curious 'cause
they gave me "retail clerk."

07:08.052 --> 07:09.262
Made me wonder
if they have a mall here,

07:09.345 --> 07:10.555
'cause that'd be frickin' amazing.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.973
I used to love working in the mall.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.808
They put me in animal control.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.061
I imagine all of these are based
on jobs from before the fall.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.480
Yeah, mine isn't really an assignment.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.942
Looks like an invitation.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.945
Someone wants to meet
and talk about, and I quote,

07:26.028 --> 07:28.281
"Opportunities within
our great community."

07:28.364 --> 07:30.783
Ooh! Yumiko's fancy!
Must be the accent.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.702
We need to plot
a course correction ASAP

07:32.785 --> 07:34.787
before these entanglements
usurp our Plan A.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.457
I think a multi-pronged strategy
would be in order.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.749
Agreed.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.793
I'll see what this case supervisor can do.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.628
Um, I'm gonna go with Ezekiel.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.172
I wanna see more of this place.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.590
And I'm feeling lucky.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.300
I'm supposed to meet up with Stephanie.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.093
I'll get the lay of the land
and the proverbial skinny.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.304
Maybe whoever gave you that can help.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.650
Excuse me.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.028
Your case supervisor
can answer all your questions.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.488
Yeah, I don't seem to have
one of those.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.157
Just this letter from
the Office of State Affairs.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.411
Yes, ma'am.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.746
How can I help?

08:17.288 --> 08:18.664
Well, during processing,

08:18.748 --> 08:20.249
I was inquiring about
a family member living here,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.543
but I haven't heard anything since.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.587
I'd be happy to help you
with that.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.022
Wall's gonna be more fragile
since they broke through.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.649
People are getting anxious.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.025
There's dead on the north side.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.693
We're banging the wall
to spread them out.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.488
-It's working.
-For now, but they'll be back.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.365
Yeah, we need a long-term fix.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.367
Any update on tools?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.619
Still haven't replaced
what the skins destroyed.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.287
And we're back to square one
on food.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.456
What's left of the horse
has been salted and jerkied.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.208
Stuff's nasty, but it's going fast.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.460
What about Hilltop?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.504
Maybe some of the blacksmithing
tools survived the fire.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.340
A few of us can make a run,

09:09.423 --> 09:11.467
maybe see if there's some game
nearby while we're at it.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.469
-Yeah.
-And if there's nothing left?

09:16.847 --> 09:18.224
If we can't make Alexandria safe,

09:18.307 --> 09:20.101
we need to start
thinking about other options.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.061
Alexandria's our home.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.355
I'm not ready to abandon ship.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.898
Not yet.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.109
We gotta fight to save it first.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.294
We should get moving.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.713
The others could already be
at the outpost.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.923
Or it could just be us.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.513
You know the only way this works

09:57.597 --> 09:59.557
is if we trust each other.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.475
Why would I ever trust you?

10:04.186 --> 10:06.355
I don't know, Maggie.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.066
'Cause you want to stay alive,
same as me.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.362
If I stay alive,

10:13.571 --> 10:16.032
it'll be in spite of you,
not because of you.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.366
Jesus.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.661
You know, if...
if that's how you feel,

10:20.745 --> 10:23.664
I don't understand why
you haven't put me down yet.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.293
Shit!

10:35.635 --> 10:38.095
I ask myself that question every day.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.976
Shit.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.569
Whoa.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.592
Jesus.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.803
Look.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.182
Practically been picked clean.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.810
Might be more than the dead.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.812
Heads up.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.945
Those are our people.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.453
Dude...

11:46.789 --> 11:48.457
It's Troy.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.465
Let's just get this done.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.896
-We need to keep moving.
-Yeah.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.314
Yeah.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.607
Eyes open.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.116
Ready? Start!

13:05.451 --> 13:06.911
Good. Again.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.542
Center yourself.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.711
Weight on your back foot.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.051
Aim for the head, then stab!

13:24.178 --> 13:25.805
Good. Again.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.556
Look. This is crazy.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.351
God. Oh!

13:30.434 --> 13:31.811
What's wrong?

13:33.437 --> 13:35.898
Whoa! Oh!

13:35.981 --> 13:37.358
Oh, oh!

13:37.441 --> 13:38.692
Hey!

13:38.776 --> 13:40.528
You shouldn't be doing that!

13:42.655 --> 13:45.366
Whoa!

13:45.449 --> 13:47.743
Get away from there.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.119
Calm down. We're just having fun.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.204
It's dangerous.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.332
If you don't stop, I'm gonna tell Rosita.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.585
Shut up! You talk too much.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.796
No wonder your mom abandoned you.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.298
What did you say?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.842
You're such a baby.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.135
She must've gotten tired
of all her whining.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.683
Say it again.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.937
I dare you.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.901
Judith, don't.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.660
Stay away from me, you psycho.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.163
What are you looking at?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.940
Doesn't look like
anybody's been here, so...

15:41.774 --> 15:43.692
So we wait.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.486
Yeah.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.862
How long?

15:49.156 --> 15:51.992
How long would you want someone
to wait for you?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.702
I just think the longer we stay here,

15:53.786 --> 15:56.997
the more likely it is
that these lunatics catch us.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.418
Look, how about
we take this food back, alright?

16:01.502 --> 16:02.711
I know it's not a lot,

16:02.795 --> 16:03.963
but at least it's something.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.214
It's nothing.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.759
We need to feed a whole community.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.054
Maggie, you need to know
when to cut your losses.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.895
Those losses...

16:21.981 --> 16:24.316
...are my people.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.110
I know. I do.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.528
But you still have people.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.279
You still have Hershel.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.035
Do you think I don't know that?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.539
It's the reason we're doing this.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.332
But "we" can't.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.292
See, that's my point.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.919
Alright, look, I-I know
I don't get a vote here,

16:44.003 --> 16:45.754
and that's fine, but here's mine anyway.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.923
We give it 'til sundown.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.135
And if the others don't show by then,

16:51.218 --> 16:52.886
they're not gonna.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.366
<i>She's a three-speed girl</i>

17:14.450 --> 17:17.161
Um, I'll be right with you.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.377
<i>Well, lawdy, lawdy</i>

17:25.461 --> 17:28.255
<i>She's a three-speed girl</i>

17:35.262 --> 17:37.598
Hi. How you doing?

17:37.681 --> 17:40.184
Just got a fresh batch
of doughnuts out of the oven.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.977
I-I'm actually looking for someone.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.812
Cake's frosted and ready, boss.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.106
Should I run it over to...

17:48.275 --> 17:50.235
Hi, Tomi.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.327
Not much,
but better than nothing.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.248
Everything we have, gone.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.210
Not everything.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.837
A lot of us are still standing.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.964
Remember that.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.928
There's more.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.556
We need to take care of it
before we keep searching.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.060
Wait. Look.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.441
The way they're moving...

18:30.943 --> 18:32.319
They're being herded.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.446
Whisperers.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.674
Stop! Don't kill him!

18:53.757 --> 18:55.008
I know him.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.469
What the hell is he doing here?

18:59.346 --> 19:00.597
Let's find out.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.735
Extra sprinkles, please.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.487
-Of course.
-Oh.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.072
I have the order ready for Ms. Milton.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.324
Just a moment.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.076
Here you go.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.287
I included samples of our
newest flavor, Praline Dream.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.997
Excuse me.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.083
That wouldn't happen to be
Rocky Road there, would it?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.507
Thank you for your patience.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.509
Yeah, no problem.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.760
And keep the change.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.596
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.932
Here you go.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.393
It's not black raspberry,
but see what you think.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.319
Mmm.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.780
-Hot damn.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.954
If you don't mind me saying,

20:06.038 --> 20:07.748
this place has all kinds
of creature comforts

20:07.831 --> 20:09.458
I never knew how much I missed.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.959
I'm an interesting creature,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.754
so this is a fine day for me.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.298
Well, it's a very fine day
for me, too.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.759
I'm glad you're here.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.975
Where are you? You drifted.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.562
A lot of people back where I'm from

20:30.646 --> 20:32.356
could use a place like this.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.358
Yeah.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.985
While I'd be content to keep
strong with you indefinitely,

20:37.069 --> 20:38.237
I wouldn't be the man I am

20:38.320 --> 20:40.781
if I didn't do what I came here for.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.783
I, uh...

20:44.660 --> 20:46.328
We can't stay.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.372
We need to help our friends.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.998
Given the significant amount
of red tape

20:50.082 --> 20:51.375
around every nook and cranny here,

20:51.458 --> 20:52.793
I was wondering
if I could get some advice

20:52.876 --> 20:54.544
on how to cut through.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.714
I wish I had some,

20:57.798 --> 21:01.385
but everything
really moves slowly around here.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.095
Want to sit?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.787
The town radio is in there.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.330
I bet you'd feel better

21:30.414 --> 21:31.957
if you could talk
to your people back home.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.584
But you're afraid to ask.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.045
I'm afraid to involve you in something

21:37.129 --> 21:39.047
that's not your responsibility.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.841
I want to help.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.844
Are you sure?

21:43.927 --> 21:45.637
I work in the Comms Department.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.431
I could get access
to the equipment,

21:47.514 --> 21:48.765
but to get official clearance,

21:48.849 --> 21:51.435
it would take a couple weeks, so...

21:51.518 --> 21:53.854
So back to square one.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.233
We found the deputy supervisor.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.444
Says it'll be five weeks
to see her boss.

22:00.527 --> 22:01.737
Might as well be years.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.243
By any chance, is there
an unofficial version

22:08.327 --> 22:10.078
of your offer?

22:21.548 --> 22:22.841
Oh, wow.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.645
Mom said we have to stay here.

22:54.998 --> 22:56.500
Who did this?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.168
Who broke our handprints?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.631
-Was it you?
-No.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.049
Don't lie.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.926
You gonna pull another knife on me?

23:06.009 --> 23:07.886
I said I didn't do it.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.346
Come on.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.563
I can help you put it
back together, Judith.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.023
Me, too.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.192
We all will.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.623
I remember when you made those.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.960
You were so small.

23:41.628 --> 23:44.047
Carl wanted you
to have a memory together.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.552
Now it's broken, and he's gone.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.722
Everybody is.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.568
I miss them all, too.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.452
Does it get easier?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.081
I'd be lying if I said it did.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.378
I'm worried I'll start
to forget about them.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.549
Judith.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.355
You know, I never really knew my dad.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.985
And my mom died when...

24:47.486 --> 24:49.488
I was a little older than you are now.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.950
I still miss her all the time.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.622
For a long time,
it was just the two of us.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.458
And we moved a lot,
from job to job.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.670
But she always managed
to keep us going.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.091
I didn't know it then, but...

25:10.175 --> 25:12.636
she was teaching me
to survive on my own.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.974
So I'd be okay
if she ever wasn't there.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.730
And Carl and your dad
did the same thing for you.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.984
So you'd always be able
to get though the tough times.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.241
Pieces of wood are nice.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.079
But you don't need that
to remember

25:39.162 --> 25:40.705
how much they loved you.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.880
Besides, I'm really good
at fixing things.

25:56.846 --> 25:57.931
Name?

25:58.014 --> 26:00.850
And don't give us any of that
Alpha/Beta garbage, either.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.727
Keith.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.355
That's my name.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.648
What are you doing here, Keith?

26:06.731 --> 26:07.941
I'm not hurting anyone.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.818
Just answer the question.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.779
A-After Alpha fell, the herd scattered.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.073
Those who weren't killed
or burned are gone.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.324
I'm all that's left.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.576
You haven't seen anyone else?

26:17.659 --> 26:18.868
No.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.287
Then why do you keep the walkers?

26:20.745 --> 26:22.872
Protection, comfort.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.500
Old habit.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.168
What do you think?

26:27.252 --> 26:29.588
I think I haven't met
a Whisperer who wasn't a liar.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.840
What about Mary?

26:32.424 --> 26:33.925
You believed her.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.594
How do you know he's lying?

26:35.677 --> 26:37.429
What makes you so certain
he isn't?

26:38.179 --> 26:40.140
How well do you know him?

26:40.223 --> 26:42.350
He wasn't part
of my mother's inner circle.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.810
He was afraid of her.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.687
Well, that proves he's got eyes,
not much else.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.147
Lydia.

26:47.647 --> 26:50.525
I snuck food to you
during the long winters

26:50.609 --> 26:52.360
when Alpha wasn't looking.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.822
You remember? Tell them.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.576
I'm not sure.

27:00.368 --> 27:02.162
Guess she doesn't know you
that well after all.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.330
It doesn't matter.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.206
My mother's dead.
He's not hurting anyone.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.958
No, he's hiding something.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.376
You think it's a trap?

27:08.460 --> 27:09.753
Wouldn't put it past him.

27:12.756 --> 27:13.965
Aaron's right.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.092
We need to make sure
he's not a threat.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.762
Let's get him into the cellar
until we decide what to do with him.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.139
No. No!

27:34.319 --> 27:36.196
-Dude...
-What is it?

27:36.279 --> 27:38.114
Nothing good.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.585
He's not alone.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.797
Let's see what else he lied about.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.245
How many more?

28:25.328 --> 28:26.579
What?

28:26.663 --> 28:29.207
How many more of you are out there?

28:29.290 --> 28:31.251
This is it, I swear!

28:31.334 --> 28:32.877
You expect me to believe that?

28:32.961 --> 28:34.254
After you just lied to my face?

28:34.337 --> 28:37.924
Aaron, look at them.
They're scared.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.467
They're just trying to be people again.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.220
Or they're a threat,
hiding in plain sight

28:42.303 --> 28:43.471
before their people
come back and ambush us.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.640
We weren't all monsters.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.436
Please. Please.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.523
This is Nabila's.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.942
-Jerry...
-No.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.654
They were in Alexandria.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.531
They burnt down our home.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.245
What do you wanna do?

29:12.208 --> 29:13.835
Look out!

29:34.689 --> 29:36.065
My turn.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.188
You're... You're a swordswoman
and an archer?

30:57.272 --> 30:59.774
Yeah, I'm pretty good with
a slingshot, too, in a pinch.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.735
Wow. Not bad for a barrister.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.322
Wow. You've changed, Miko.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.575
So have you.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.871
How did you even find this place?

31:14.455 --> 31:17.959
I fled Chicago when things
first started going bad.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.879
After I left you that voicemail,

31:20.962 --> 31:22.964
I got in a car and headed east.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.216
Ran out of gas about 20 miles
north of here

31:25.300 --> 31:28.344
but got lucky enough to link up
with some good people.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.556
We all wound up here pretty early on

31:31.639 --> 31:34.350
when the Miltons made
this place a safe haven.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.437
It started with a few secure blocks,

31:37.520 --> 31:39.397
but the community's been expanding

31:39.480 --> 31:41.190
a little at a time ever since.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.445
I, uh... I almost forget

31:45.653 --> 31:48.573
what's going on outside these walls.

31:50.199 --> 31:54.162
And you've just been here
this whole time,

31:54.245 --> 31:55.955
just making cakes?

31:56.789 --> 31:59.626
I like baking. It makes me happy.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.669
-Tomi, you were a surgeon.
-Hey, no.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.004
Please, not now.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.464
But you could save people.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.799
Still trying to run people's lives, Miko?

32:09.594 --> 32:11.554
I'm not trying to start anything.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.390
I just want what's best for you.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.478
When was the last time
you saw me happy, Miko?

32:18.561 --> 32:20.647
Truly content?

32:20.730 --> 32:22.523
Can't remember.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.484
Maybe now.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.654
I like my life the way it is.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.782
It's the one gift I got

32:30.865 --> 32:32.909
out of the world falling apart.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.497
Please, don't ruin this for me.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.500
Of course I wouldn't.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.629
Look, just tell me one thing.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.924
Is this place really as good as it seems?

32:49.342 --> 32:51.177
Better.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.221
So if I wanted to get help for people,

32:53.304 --> 32:54.973
I could do that here?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.309
Anything's possible,

32:58.393 --> 32:59.978
as long as you follow the rules.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.356
Want some cake?

33:03.439 --> 33:04.607
Hell yes.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.075
Hey!

33:14.158 --> 33:15.910
Fancy meeting you here, Mercer.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.830
Ooh! Oh, they clearly
got a gym in this joint.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.290
Your chiseling is perfecto.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.127
Uh, excuse me.
Got business inside.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.378
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

33:25.461 --> 33:29.257
I... I wanted to thank you.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.135
For what?

33:34.345 --> 33:36.889
For making sure this got back to me.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.267
No need.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.729
Just returning your property, "Princess."

33:45.773 --> 33:47.275
Was there something else?

33:47.358 --> 33:48.693
Yeah.

33:50.319 --> 33:55.825
You have really beautiful eyelashes.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.335
-Tell me where the others went.

34:06.419 --> 34:07.962
Where are they?

34:08.546 --> 34:11.174
How many more? Huh?

34:13.926 --> 34:15.678
Answer me!

34:22.852 --> 34:26.064
Lydia, help me! Please!

34:26.481 --> 34:28.024
Where are they?

34:28.441 --> 34:31.277
Alpha was right
about you people.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.613
You pretend you're better than the dead.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.656
But dead is honest.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.159
Your friends are better off.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.390
See, the clock's ticking now.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.142
Do you feel better off?

35:05.603 --> 35:07.063
Or I can help you.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.356
I can cut off your hand

35:08.439 --> 35:10.650
before the infection spreads
and you turn.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.779
Would you like that?

35:15.279 --> 35:16.781
We don't have much time.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.325
-Please...
-Where are they?

35:19.408 --> 35:21.994
I don't know! I swear!

35:22.078 --> 35:23.329
You have to believe me...

35:23.412 --> 35:25.540
Are the Whisperers still a threat?

35:25.623 --> 35:28.126
-No!
-Stop lying!

35:28.209 --> 35:30.086
-Aaron, enough!
-No, I need answers!

35:30.169 --> 35:31.462
No, you want something else.

35:32.171 --> 35:35.007
I don't have to be here to watch it.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.634
Again.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.764
Just tell the truth, man.

35:43.933 --> 35:47.186
What do you want me to say?

35:47.270 --> 35:49.313
There were more of us!

35:49.397 --> 35:52.358
But they...they're gone!

35:52.441 --> 35:54.902
I don't know!

35:57.989 --> 35:59.991
What the hell are you doing?

36:00.074 --> 36:01.576
Stopping you from doing something else

36:01.659 --> 36:03.202
you're gonna regret.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.788
I'm doing what I have to
to keep everyone I love safe.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.665
You of all people should understand that.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.168
Not like this.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.836
Look around.

36:11.919 --> 36:14.088
We are standing on the ashes

36:14.172 --> 36:16.674
of what the Whisperers destroyed.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.969
Gracie is going hungry because of them!

36:23.931 --> 36:26.142
The world is full of people
who are beyond saving,

36:26.225 --> 36:27.393
and I am not gonna wait for them

36:27.476 --> 36:28.644
to show up at our doorstep.

36:28.728 --> 36:29.770
No.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.150
What happened to Henry...

36:35.026 --> 36:37.069
and how I felt after...

36:38.362 --> 36:39.739
it controlled me.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.033
I let it take me down a very dark path.

36:42.116 --> 36:44.160
People that I care about were hurt.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.165
Now everything that I do, I carry that.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.337
This is a path you don't want to go down.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.714
Now you let him go.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.216
Let him go.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.909
I can cut your hand off
or you can do it yourself.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.535
Choice is yours.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.091
Okay. Ah.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.927
Told you I'd find it.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.930
Right here?

37:46.013 --> 37:49.600
<i>Alexandria.</i>
<i>Alexandria, this is Eugene. Come back.</i>

37:49.684 --> 37:52.645
Eugene! Eugene, are you okay?

37:52.728 --> 37:54.188
<i>Rosita?</i>

37:54.272 --> 37:56.524
<i>Oh, it's dang good</i>
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

37:56.607 --> 37:58.109
You too. I got Judith here.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.278
Hi. Are you all safe?

38:01.195 --> 38:02.863
<i>Hello! Hey, Judith.</i>

38:02.947 --> 38:05.491
<i>Yes, we're all safe. We're doing okay.</i>

38:05.574 --> 38:07.243
<i>Uh, how are things there?</i>

38:09.453 --> 38:11.289
Well, the war's over.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.749
Uh, Alpha and Beta are dead.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.836
But... Alexandria's trashed,

38:16.919 --> 38:18.671
and we're running out of food.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.965
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't get...</i>

38:22.591 --> 38:25.469
Yeah. Eugene?

38:25.553 --> 38:27.430
Eugene, are you still there?

38:28.764 --> 38:30.182
Eugene, where are you?

38:30.808 --> 38:32.059
Is he gone?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.312
Something's haywire. Lost the feed.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.481
Uh, try a higher frequency.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.400
Hands up! Move away from the radio.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.862
No harm's been done,
I can assure you.

38:43.779 --> 38:45.197
You're under arrest...

38:46.866 --> 38:49.452
...for the unauthorized use
of government property.

39:17.396 --> 39:19.023
What are you doing?

39:22.109 --> 39:23.486
I'm leaving.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.654
Not with those supplies you aren't.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.448
I'm taking them back to Alexandria.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.658
This mission isn't finished.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.119
It is for me.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.709
Stop it!

39:59.313 --> 40:00.564
Oh, my God. You made it.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.358
Hey.

40:05.694 --> 40:06.946
Are you okay?

40:07.029 --> 40:09.156
Been better. Been worse.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.574
Same.

40:10.658 --> 40:11.867
We found each other in the woods.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.285
Made sure no one
followed us back here.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.496
Good. Sit down.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.166
We...didn't know if you'd survived.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.503
But if you did, knew you'd be here.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.382
What about the others?

40:27.842 --> 40:31.804
Duncan, Agatha, Cole, they're...

40:32.596 --> 40:34.390
they're dead.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.810
Alden's hurt.

40:37.893 --> 40:39.728
He's holed up in a church somewhere.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.480
Daryl and Frost, I don't know.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.568
So then...

40:46.193 --> 40:47.403
we wait.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.034
We wait.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.756
Holy shit.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.467
I've ruined everything.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.512
I just...

41:18.934 --> 41:20.644
Where is the young woman
that was with me

41:20.728 --> 41:22.188
at the train station?

41:23.564 --> 41:25.941
You are hereby notified
that you're being charged

41:26.025 --> 41:29.153
with wanton trespassing,
reckless endangerment,

41:29.278 --> 41:31.655
and illegal communication
with a foreign entity...

41:31.739 --> 41:33.866
all violations of Article 4,

41:33.949 --> 41:36.744
Section 2 of the Commonwealth
criminal code.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.996
You've been granted
a hearing before a judge

41:39.079 --> 41:40.414
within the hour.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.708
If found guilty, you will be dropped off

41:42.791 --> 41:44.335
in a zone far outside our walls

41:44.418 --> 41:46.545
and banished from ever returning.

41:46.629 --> 41:48.005
We did what we did for good reason.

41:48.088 --> 41:49.590
If you'd just let us explain...

41:49.673 --> 41:51.467
Tell it to the judge,
although it won't matter,

41:51.550 --> 41:53.260
especially since you've
been here less than a day

41:53.344 --> 41:54.887
and already broken several laws.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.514
We wanna talk to our lawyer.

41:56.597 --> 41:57.848
You have an attorney?

41:57.932 --> 42:00.518
Damn right we do.
A fancy one, too.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.561
So if this place likes rules so much,

42:02.645 --> 42:04.605
you have to let us have one.
It's our right.

42:04.688 --> 42:05.898
Rights are for citizens.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.608
You're asylum seekers.

42:07.816 --> 42:09.818
Privileges come when you've earned them.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.656
Please, just...

42:14.198 --> 42:15.741
let me talk to Stephanie.

42:15.824 --> 42:17.201
She can vouch for us.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.328
She's being processed
and charged separately,

42:19.411 --> 42:20.579
as a citizen.

42:20.663 --> 42:22.081
That's some bullshit.

42:22.164 --> 42:23.791
I'll take it from here, John.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.555
Let them go.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.974
Mr. Hornsby, I can't.
They're awaiting trial.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.395
Do not move them.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.275
I'm going to find Mercer.

42:59.868 --> 43:01.620
Wait. Was that...

43:01.704 --> 43:03.581
Cheesy video guy!

43:03.664 --> 43:05.791
Hornsby is someone
that you guys can trust.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.919
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me so fast.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.422
He might be able to stop you
from being banished,

43:11.505 --> 43:13.674
but it won't be scot-free.

43:14.133 --> 43:15.759
You'll have to pay for what you've done.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.344
One way or another.

43:20.556 --> 43:21.974
I'm sorry about all this.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.811
I understand.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.023
After all his people have lost.

43:30.733 --> 43:34.445
If Alpha were still here,
she would've done worse.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.574
For you...mushrooms.

43:38.657 --> 43:40.326
For you and the others.

43:41.327 --> 43:44.330
Thank you...for this
and for what you said.

43:44.413 --> 43:45.748
We weren't all like her.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.376
Some of us just wanted to survive.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.302
Don't ever look back.

44:07.144 --> 44:09.313
You don't think we've changed, do you?

44:11.482 --> 44:12.733
It's not for me to say.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.401
I can prove it.

44:14.652 --> 44:17.321
-How?
-We saw one of your people.

44:17.404 --> 44:19.114
The girl who came out of the cave

44:19.198 --> 44:20.741
where Alpha kept the horde.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.246
What did you say?

44:26.330 --> 44:28.165
After the collapse.

44:28.248 --> 44:29.625
There were many,

44:29.750 --> 44:33.087
then there were two,
and then she was all alone.

44:33.295 --> 44:36.006
Was she all right?
She looked hurt but alive.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.508
Where did you last see her?

44:37.591 --> 44:38.926
In the woods.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.344
By the screaming cave.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.098
What do you think?

44:44.181 --> 44:46.809
I'm thinking it's probably a good thing
you didn't kill him.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.143
Do you know where that is
he's talking about?

44:48.227 --> 44:49.561
Yeah, yeah, it's near Alexandria.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.897
-We gotta go...now.
-Carol, Carol.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.565
No. Connie's out there alive.

44:53.649 --> 44:54.942
I know. It's getting late.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.568
It'll be dark before we get back.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.779
Start at first light, yeah?
