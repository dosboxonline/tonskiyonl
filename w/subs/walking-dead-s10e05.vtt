(GRUNTS)

18:07.004 --> 18:10.132
ALDEN: So, uh, the roofing
and the gutters should be fine,

18:10.215 --> 18:12.092
but the plumbing's
making me kinda nervous.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.011
I have to scavenge
for more copper.

18:15.304 --> 18:17.014
I should really
be out there with them.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.646
You know,
if I was lost in the woods,

18:24.730 --> 18:26.815
it's the three of them
I'd want to come looking for me.

18:30.319 --> 18:33.030
Somebody's gotta hang back,
deal with the plumbing.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.157
(CHUCKLES)

18:35.240 --> 18:37.701
I'll... I'll ask Oscar
about the copper.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.414
You really think
Kelly's okay?

18:42.497 --> 18:43.916
I hope so.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.585
EARL: What about us?

18:46.668 --> 18:48.670
That tree
didn't fall on its own.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.881
Wasn't leaning or dying.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.549
The roots were healthy.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.220
If you don't think they're
coming back for worse, son,

18:56.303 --> 18:57.930
you're not thinking
at all.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.267
I haven't forgotten about them,
you know?

19:04.144 --> 19:06.021
Think about 'em
every day.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.314
Well, good.
Don't stop.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.816
(POUNDING)

19:13.654 --> 19:15.781
EZEKIEL: We've had some thefts
lately.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.450
Took a quarter
of our medical supplies.

19:18.534 --> 19:19.618
(GRUNTS)

19:23.330 --> 19:24.831
-Sorry. I...
-EZEKIEL: No, no.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.291
It's, uh...

19:26.375 --> 19:29.545
Henry forged it
during his apprenticeship.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.339
Found it
wrapped among his things.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.466
A gift intended for me
but never...

19:35.884 --> 19:38.637
(COUGHING)

19:38.720 --> 19:39.763
You okay?

19:39.847 --> 19:41.265
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.434
(COUGHS,
INHALES DEEPLY)

19:44.518 --> 19:46.144
-Uh-huh.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

19:46.228 --> 19:47.229
That doesn't sound good.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.480
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

19:48.564 --> 19:50.065
It's nothing.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.775
Just the regular
slings and arrows.

19:51.859 --> 19:52.860
SIDDIQ: Uh-huh.

19:52.943 --> 19:54.361
Or smoke inhalation from the
fire might've triggered it.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.612
Let me just...

19:55.696 --> 19:57.114
I said I was fine.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.282
Okay.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.210
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

20:19.428 --> 20:20.512
How long have you...

20:20.596 --> 20:21.680
A month.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.641
It's grown since then.

20:27.728 --> 20:28.812
Look.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.440
It could be a lot of things,
yeah?

20:31.523 --> 20:33.525
Infection. You know you might've
injured yourself.

20:33.609 --> 20:34.693
EZEKIEL: I know what it is.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.111
Listen, without tests,
you can't be sure.

20:36.195 --> 20:38.530
EZEKIEL: Siddiq,
I know what it is.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.962
Growing up,
my grandmother went through it,

20:54.046 --> 20:55.297
then my father.

20:56.548 --> 21:00.010
The pain, the coughing,
the swelling.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.721
I watched them fight it
and win.

21:02.804 --> 21:06.517
Did you know thyroid cancer
had a 98% survival rate?

21:06.600 --> 21:08.435
Different times.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.897
Times of sorcery
and witchcraft.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.860
Chemo,
iodine radiation therapy,

21:16.944 --> 21:18.779
thyroidectomies.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.448
Now?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.911
Now we both know
what it means.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.788
No,
you can manage it.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.333
Acupuncture,
uh, hypnosis.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.793
There's... You...

21:35.546 --> 21:40.384
You know, I've been struggling
with my own condition...

21:40.467 --> 21:41.552
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

21:41.635 --> 21:43.512
ever since the barn.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.226
That's why
I had to leave Alexandria.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.812
I just... I can't stand

21:51.895 --> 21:54.273
how everyone looks to me
for some kinda...

21:58.902 --> 22:01.613
So, you know,
maybe we can't get away from it.

22:01.697 --> 22:04.783
But we can talk about it.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.244
I mean,
what are we here for

22:07.327 --> 22:09.037
if not for each other?

22:11.623 --> 22:13.750
AMELIA:
It was just Milo and me.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.837
We'd been walking
for days, weeks,

22:18.672 --> 22:20.591
until the hissers
ran through our camp,

22:20.674 --> 22:23.135
scattered everyone
to the winds.

22:23.218 --> 22:28.140
And after that, we went back
to what it was before,

22:28.223 --> 22:30.601
what it always is
in the end,

22:30.684 --> 22:32.102
Milo and me,

22:33.353 --> 22:37.232
moving from place to place,
surviving.

22:37.316 --> 22:39.651
I get it.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.069
I've been there.

22:41.153 --> 22:42.613
AMELIA: I better stay on my feet.

22:42.696 --> 22:44.990
Milo,
you wanna come on a walk?

22:45.073 --> 22:46.158
Yeah.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.662
(COUGHS)

22:50.746 --> 22:52.456
Be safe.

23:00.756 --> 23:02.591
So, what are you
thinkin'?

23:02.674 --> 23:05.260
We follow 'em,
see where they're hiding it?

23:06.929 --> 23:08.639
Hiding what?

23:08.722 --> 23:10.891
They've got a stash
somewhere,

23:10.974 --> 23:12.768
probably
full of weapons, too.

23:14.645 --> 23:16.939
It's a chick and a kid,
Brandon.

23:17.022 --> 23:19.107
People are a resource.

23:19.191 --> 23:20.234
Yeah.

23:20.317 --> 23:21.485
Not them.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.325
(SIGHS)

23:28.408 --> 23:30.077
NEGAN: All right, look.

23:31.745 --> 23:35.165
I appreciate everything
you've done since Alexandria,

23:36.959 --> 23:39.461
but it's only gonna get
more dangerous from here.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.006
I think it's best
I go on alone

23:43.090 --> 23:45.133
and you go home.

23:48.387 --> 23:49.471
Okay.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.560
It's just,
if I go back,

23:55.936 --> 23:58.063
everyone's gonna wanna know
where I've been.

23:59.356 --> 24:01.942
What am I
supposed to say?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.861
I've never been
a great liar.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.571
(CHUCKLES)

24:13.579 --> 24:14.997
New plan, then.

24:16.874 --> 24:19.960
You go
wherever the hell you want.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.712
You go back
to Alexandria,

24:21.795 --> 24:25.507
you tell the whole world
exactly where I am.

24:27.009 --> 24:29.803
You see,
I don't give a shit.

24:29.887 --> 24:31.471
Just as long
as I don't have to see

24:31.555 --> 24:35.601
that pasty, creepy-ass face
of yours ever again.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.234
You're just like
all the others.

24:50.282 --> 24:52.117
Careful, now.

24:52.201 --> 24:53.952
Ears are the trickiest.

25:18.060 --> 25:19.770
You have something
for me?

25:21.813 --> 25:24.650
I've been damming up the creek,
like you wanted.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.694
I've just come back
for one more guardian.

25:27.778 --> 25:30.739
BETA: A guardian taken
is another lost.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.285
ALPHA: Patience.

25:35.369 --> 25:39.039
Shifts in strategy
take time.

25:39.122 --> 25:43.919
The creek,
the water, the tree,

25:44.920 --> 25:46.547
it will crush them.

25:47.798 --> 25:50.217
Or we could release
an army of thousands.

25:53.387 --> 25:55.514
ALPHA: Go ahead.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.224
Say your piece.

25:58.559 --> 26:02.312
Instead of
these little nicks,

26:03.397 --> 26:06.567
getting our guardians killed
at their walls,

26:06.650 --> 26:09.111
why don't we...

26:09.194 --> 26:12.823
cut the enemy down
all at once?

26:17.828 --> 26:19.121
Let us vote.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.833
Anyone agree?

26:31.091 --> 26:32.301
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

26:36.138 --> 26:37.848
That's democracy
for you.

26:39.725 --> 26:41.310
(GROANS)

26:44.855 --> 26:46.064
The human body...

26:46.148 --> 26:47.816
(WHIMPERS)

26:47.900 --> 26:50.444
...is fragile.

26:50.527 --> 26:52.321
All it takes
for it to collapse

26:52.404 --> 26:56.325
is a few (CLICKS TONGUE) nicks
in the right spots.

26:57.826 --> 26:58.911
(GROANS)

26:58.994 --> 27:00.662
Just like the enemy.

27:01.747 --> 27:04.917
When their world collapses,
the smart ones will know

27:05.000 --> 27:06.752
where to come to stay safe.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.547
We'll be waiting.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.436
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

27:29.650 --> 27:31.652
You said you wanted
another guardian.

27:37.199 --> 27:40.744
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

27:40.827 --> 27:41.995
NEGAN: Oh, no!

27:42.079 --> 27:43.622
We're gonna crash!

27:46.542 --> 27:47.543
Ah.

27:47.626 --> 27:48.710
Hey.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.255
Don't worry, kid.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.965
I don't bite.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.716
Your mom,
she's inside, packin',

27:54.800 --> 27:56.802
so we got a little bit of time
to kill.

27:56.885 --> 27:58.554
Where'd Brandon go?

27:58.637 --> 28:01.390
Brandon, he went looking for supplies.

28:02.933 --> 28:04.560
You know what?

28:04.643 --> 28:06.520
I'm gonna be real with you.

28:06.603 --> 28:09.314
Uh, I told Brandon to get lost.

28:09.398 --> 28:11.316
You see, uh, it turns out,

28:11.400 --> 28:14.653
not the best co-pilot,
if you catch my dri...

28:14.736 --> 28:17.197
You don't catch my drift
at all, do ya?

28:17.281 --> 28:19.575
You've never
been on a plane.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.161
Aw, man, it's all right.

28:23.245 --> 28:25.330
It's not your fault
that God turned this world

28:25.414 --> 28:27.791
into an asspit
before you were born.

28:29.293 --> 28:31.128
All right.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.422
Picture this, all right?

28:33.505 --> 28:36.884
Sitting on a plane,
really nice, comfy seats,

28:36.967 --> 28:39.887
but it feels like you've been
sitting on the runway

28:39.970 --> 28:42.264
for Goddamn ever.

28:42.347 --> 28:45.726
Suddenly,
there's this kinda rumbling,

28:45.809 --> 28:48.729
a groan, all right?

28:48.812 --> 28:52.441
The plane finally starts
to creep along, right,

28:52.524 --> 28:54.943
and now we're moving
faster and faster.

28:55.027 --> 28:56.195
And you look out
that window,

28:56.278 --> 28:58.864
and everything's
turning into a blur.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.991
And then, "Whew."

29:02.326 --> 29:04.536
Wheels come up
off the ground.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.121
You are flying.

29:06.205 --> 29:09.958
It is like voodoo magic,
man, all right?

29:10.042 --> 29:12.794
Up and up and up,
higher and higher,

29:12.878 --> 29:14.588
until it feels like
you are floating

29:14.671 --> 29:16.715
on top
of the frickin' world.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.884
And you're looking out
that little window,

29:18.967 --> 29:20.052
and you can see houses.

29:20.135 --> 29:24.389
They look like little toy houses
and little toy cars.

29:24.473 --> 29:25.557
(SIGHING) Oh.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.351
But the food?

29:27.434 --> 29:28.435
Unh-unh.

29:28.519 --> 29:30.103
No way.
They served us something.

29:30.187 --> 29:32.481
They called it beef stroganoff.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.316
Let me tell you something.
It looked like baby shit.

29:34.399 --> 29:38.445
And my Lucille (CHUCKLES)
she wouldn't even touch it.

29:42.574 --> 29:46.161
Ah, kid, there is so much
you're gonna miss

29:46.245 --> 29:50.249
growing up in this screwed-up world.

29:50.332 --> 29:53.168
You know, driving
your first set of wheels,

29:53.252 --> 29:54.920
video games,

29:55.003 --> 29:56.255
nut-tapping.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.717
What, you've never heard
of nut-tapping?

30:00.801 --> 30:01.802
Seriously?

30:01.885 --> 30:04.805
With big ol'
sausage fingers like those?

30:04.888 --> 30:06.265
(LAUGHS)

30:06.348 --> 30:09.351
All right, man, the whole point
of nut-tapping,

30:09.434 --> 30:11.436
catching the other guy
off guard, right,

30:11.520 --> 30:12.771
embarrassing him,

30:12.855 --> 30:15.190
getting even for him
calling your mom a slut

30:15.274 --> 30:16.525
or whatever.

30:17.693 --> 30:20.946
Wanna keep your wrist loose,
like this.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.364
Lean in all casual like.

30:22.447 --> 30:23.907
(WHISTLES)

30:23.991 --> 30:25.576
And then, thwack!

30:25.659 --> 30:28.412
Snap your fingers
right on his nuts.

30:28.495 --> 30:29.997
Now, you gotta remember,
you go low.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.417
You go too high,
you get nothing but dick.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.377
All right, let's see
what you got.

30:36.461 --> 30:37.796
You're a natural.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.007
See, if nut-tapping
were a sport,

30:41.091 --> 30:42.259
you wouldn't
have to 'roid up,

30:42.342 --> 30:44.720
and you would still be
in the hall of fame.

30:46.513 --> 30:48.599
(LAUGHS)

30:48.682 --> 30:49.725
Ahh.

30:49.808 --> 30:53.020
All right, kid, dinner.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.605
Not gonna happen
without fire.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.899
Fire's not gonna happen
without wood.

30:57.983 --> 30:59.860
Tell me something.
You get all packed up?

30:59.943 --> 31:01.028
Yeah.

31:04.656 --> 31:09.244
Hey, you know,
I know that moving sucks.

31:09.328 --> 31:12.372
You know, it's like
I was telling your mom, though,

31:12.456 --> 31:15.417
