00:37.029 --> 00:39.892
Back! Get back!

00:40.153 --> 00:46.443

Hurry!

00:54.950 --> 00:58.353
Run!

01:03.904 --> 01:05.685
Okay. Pull him up!

01:05.863 --> 01:08.983
Pull him up!

01:12.691 --> 01:14.848
Come on

01:47.454 --> 01:50.925
Get this to the lab. And hurry!

02:47.462 --> 02:50.432
WHO AM I
(edited by jiajing/hdvn )

02:50.647 --> 02:54.518
28 Nov 1996. Thanksgiving 18:00 Augrabies,
South Africa

03:50.860 --> 03:52.498
Move!

03:55.257 --> 03:56.799
Let's go

04:07.226 --> 04:08.754
509, unpack, and help him

04:08.883 --> 04:11.405
502, the computer,
and you check with the team

04:14.541 --> 04:16.810
03 March 06:00 Kakamas, South Africa

04:30.671 --> 04:32.371
Get ready

04:59.279 --> 05:01.148
Target is approaching!

05:41.355 --> 05:43.304
Here. Get down there!

05:47.532 --> 05:48.706
What's this stuff?

05:48.789 --> 05:49.610
Can't Move!

06:13.376 --> 06:14.977
Come on, move it!

06:17.025 --> 06:17.639
Let's go

06:17.929 --> 06:18.874
Keep moving!

06:19.161 --> 06:19.852
OK. You get up here

06:27.040 --> 06:27.901
Attention!

06:29.133 --> 06:29.829
What's your name?

06:30.035 --> 06:31.434
Don't know, sir!

06:31.922 --> 06:32.701
Where are you from?

06:32.827 --> 06:33.770
Don't know, sir!

06:34.182 --> 06:37.137
Good. No names, no background

06:37.467 --> 06:38.735
But highly disciplined

06:39.597 --> 06:42.266
Mission is over, go have some fun

06:42.799 --> 06:43.659
Thank you, sir

06:48.174 --> 06:51.786
OK. Dispose your weapons,
dispose your equipment

06:51.953 --> 06:52.689
523.

06:52.895 --> 06:53.672
Yes

06:53.878 --> 06:57.324
Go! Collect. Go!
To the main helicopter. Go!

06:58.969 --> 06:59.952
Go! Move it, go!

07:01.843 --> 07:02.539
OK. Dismiss

07:11.076 --> 07:11.896
Sorry, sir

07:34.420 --> 07:36.166
So sorry, I've to do this

07:37.912 --> 07:39.436
Don't move

07:45.703 --> 07:48.832
Sorry soldiers, weâ€™ve got only two parachutes

07:49.032 --> 07:49.974
What the hell is going on?

07:50.343 --> 07:52.343
Have a nice flight, bye

08:02.332 --> 08:02.954
Let me go

08:09.202 --> 08:10.481
What are you up to do? Say it

08:15.989 --> 08:17.838
Here's the control. Come on

09:23.859 --> 09:26.380
Jackie Chan,
one of our best agents in Hong Kong

09:26.541 --> 09:28.522
is also missing in the African action

09:29.018 --> 09:31.572
The three men they hijacked
are the scientists responsible

09:31.989 --> 09:36.405
for the comet research project recently
launched by the African state

09:36.698 --> 09:37.153
Lights!

09:38.554 --> 09:40.907
We have a serious situation on our hands

09:41.069 --> 09:44.332
The operation was carried out
with clinical precision

09:44.497 --> 09:47.717
using United States
Air Force helicopters

09:47.881 --> 09:52.301
They seized the meteorite fragments
along with the three scientists

09:52.504 --> 09:54.985
and untill now
their whereabouts are unknown

09:55.231 --> 09:56.390
If they knew the transport schedule

09:56.801 --> 09:59.648
someone must have leaked the information

09:59.893 --> 10:02.002
How many C.I.A. Staff
knew about this project?

10:02.457 --> 10:03.733
I know where you're heading with this,
Norman,

10:03.980 --> 10:05.012
and I don't like it

10:05.305 --> 10:07.743
How can you be so sure
it wasn't one of your own people?

10:07.863 --> 10:10.046
Why the hell would my guys
break into a hangar

10:10.215 --> 10:12.647
they already have access to
and steal their own aircraft?

10:12.774 --> 10:16.035
Because it's a perfect cover
and no one would suspect them

10:16.366 --> 10:17.727
And remember, General

10:18.018 --> 10:21.279
The C.I.A. Pulled out of South Africa
over a year ago

10:21.525 --> 10:23.261
Only the essential staff remain

10:23.425 --> 10:25.651
Right now, our first concern

10:25.818 --> 10:28.457
should be the retrieval
of the scientists and the fragments

10:28.624 --> 10:32.129
Agreed. There could be
serious military ramifications

10:32.219 --> 10:34.900
if the wrong people
get a hold of this formula

10:35.146 --> 10:37.667
We've got to find out
who's behind this pulling the strings

10:37.832 --> 10:39.117
Agent Morgan

10:39.439 --> 10:40.514
Yes, sir

10:40.798 --> 10:43.032
You used to head up
our South African operation

10:43.400 --> 10:46.006
You know the terrain,
you know the locals

10:46.083 --> 10:48.150
Take 3 agents
and hop the next flight over there

10:48.276 --> 10:50.878
I want to see positive results. And fast

10:51.004 --> 10:51.987
Consider it done, sir

10:52.278 --> 10:52.859
Thank you, Terry

10:53.103 --> 10:53.559
Bye

10:54.704 --> 10:55.123
General Sharman

10:55.410 --> 10:55.989
Hello, Norman

10:56.152 --> 10:57.849
I hear you're retiring a few days

10:58.016 --> 10:58.381
Yes, I am

10:58.922 --> 11:00.367
Congratulations on your retirement,
General Sharman

11:00.944 --> 11:02.183
Thank you

11:03.258 --> 11:05.778
I bet you're going to miss being
in the middle of all the action

11:06.026 --> 11:08.188
Norman, I'm going to take that
fat pension check of mine

11:08.382 --> 11:11.534
and head for my favorite fishing hole

11:12.022 --> 11:13.961
I want a Black Op assigned to this case

11:14.167 --> 11:16.076
Are you saying
we can't trust our own people?

11:16.360 --> 11:18.219
Better safe than sorry

11:19.091 --> 11:20.620
Shall I select them from Washington or

11:20.782 --> 11:21.894
from one of the outside branches?

11:23.388 --> 11:24.333
Outside

11:24.588 --> 11:26.484
Sir, Mr. White is here

11:26.734 --> 11:27.852
Thank you. Send him in

11:28.012 --> 11:29.300
And tell them to report to me directly

11:29.336 --> 11:29.873
Yes, sir

11:31.741 --> 11:35.080
Your plan worked, mission completed

12:27.718 --> 12:29.643
What's wrong with him?

12:29.819 --> 12:31.343
How is he?

12:32.949 --> 12:34.489
He's just woken up

12:34.786 --> 12:39.184
My friend! You gave us quite a scare

12:39.326 --> 12:44.064
We're happy you've woken up.
Welcome to our land

13:02.490 --> 13:05.468
Where am I? How did I get here?

13:05.882 --> 13:10.308
These men found you in the mountains

13:10.809 --> 13:13.208
Now, I want to know,
where do you come from

13:13.468 --> 13:15.368
and how did you get here?

13:15.782 --> 13:17.586
I don't know your language.

13:18.116 --> 13:19.939
Does anybody speak English?

13:20.183 --> 13:26.044
I am the chief. Me. The chief

13:27.817 --> 13:31.789
And who are you? What is your name?

13:35.702 --> 13:37.395
Who am I?

13:40.032 --> 13:41.576
Who am I?

13:41.688 --> 13:43.797
His name is "Who Am l"

13:44.465 --> 13:45.116
Who am I?

13:49.568 --> 13:51.301
Your name is "Who Am l"?

13:52.582 --> 13:53.705
Who am I

13:57.206 --> 13:58.718
Who Am I

14:36.734 --> 14:39.198
Hey! Looks like you're getting better,
my man

14:39.243 --> 14:41.463
I knew he would

14:59.045 --> 15:00.513
Come on, moving

15:12.497 --> 15:13.568
What are you doing on this search, sir?

15:13.942 --> 15:15.933
Langley must be serious about
finding these guys

15:16.511 --> 15:19.369
They're traitors.
They've stolen a discovery

15:19.533 --> 15:21.646
which could keep our nation on top,

15:22.717 --> 15:24.337
in the 21st century

15:26.028 --> 15:27.028
Yes, sir

15:30.528 --> 15:32.229
Hey, Baba

15:36.729 --> 15:40.430
Who am I, we have seen
a miracle over the mountain

15:41.518 --> 15:43.108
There was iron that had been burnt

15:43.618 --> 15:47.858
We buried 8 bodies wearing
same clothes like yours

15:48.119 --> 15:49.859
Come with us.It's far, far on the other side.

15:52.059 --> 15:53.989
You mean come with you? Go?

15:54.129 --> 15:56.070
Yes. Let's go!

15:56.730 --> 15:57.570
Go!

17:05.864 --> 17:08.271
Yvirorich, Russian

17:08.608 --> 17:09.852
Jakol, Isreal

17:09.971 --> 17:11.546
Hans, German

17:11.795 --> 17:12.422
Thailand

17:12.544 --> 17:13.286
Tachi, Japan

17:13.785 --> 17:14.406
Korea

18:09.820 --> 18:12.695
Who Am I, come quickly! Come! I don't understand

18:30.280 --> 18:31.906
See, there it is. The fire I told you about

18:39.281 --> 18:40.907
A light!

19:06.032 --> 19:11.274
I can go! I can go! Yes! I can go!

19:44.559 --> 19:47.065
When we found you, you were wearing the same clothes.
Am I right?

19:47.553 --> 19:50.011
Yes. We wear the same clothes

20:00.550 --> 20:04.243
Eleven done one too many

20:06.578 --> 20:09.604
Baba.
Never play withdead people's belongings

20:13.809 --> 20:16.013
I know this is bad luck for your culture

20:16.612 --> 20:19.849
I'll go on alone. Thank you

20:20.573 --> 20:22.129
Go well!

20:26.141 --> 20:28.584
Baba
Can I borrow your compass?

20:29.485 --> 20:32.116
Can I take it?

20:32.931 --> 20:34.652
I bring back, I promise

20:36.650 --> 20:38.022
I promise

20:38.181 --> 20:40.895
Please come back soon. I will miss you

20:46.409 --> 20:48.084
Thank you.
Be careful !

20:48.382 --> 20:49.504
Take care, my friend

20:49.729 --> 20:51.785
You will succeed!

21:22.073 --> 21:24.027
Somebody! Help us!

21:24.318 --> 21:25.895
Hey! Look!

21:26.145 --> 21:27.346
Don't you see us?

21:27.512 --> 21:30.047
Help! Come back!

21:30.172 --> 21:31.914
Somebody! Help!

21:33.865 --> 21:34.570
Are you okay?

21:35.443 --> 21:36.317
We're over here! Help!

21:36.731 --> 21:37.478
Look! Somebody! Help us!

21:57.519 --> 21:58.672
Oh, my god!

22:18.704 --> 22:19.536
Get away from him!

22:21.238 --> 22:23.489
Stop eating my brother, you animal!

22:24.559 --> 22:25.265
Leave us alone!

22:26.968 --> 22:27.673
Leave us alone!

22:32.532 --> 22:33.113
Don't move!

22:35.810 --> 22:37.345
Don't move! You know this?

22:37.470 --> 22:38.220
This is a gun!

22:39.094 --> 22:41.168
You know, I can bang bang you!

22:41.913 --> 22:42.786
You know, I can shoot you!

22:43.948 --> 22:45.906
I can bang bang you, you know?

22:49.511 --> 22:52.340
I know karate! Karate!

23:10.852 --> 23:12.518
Medicine!

23:16.501 --> 23:21.481
It's medicine!

23:27.210 --> 23:28.874
My brother!

23:46.850 --> 23:50.276
You're helping my brother!

23:52.245 --> 23:53.869
You understand English?

23:54.654 --> 23:56.238
Say something

23:58.349 --> 24:05.035
Those medicine make my mouth numb

24:05.241 --> 24:06.116
You speak French?

24:06.530 --> 24:09.107
I understand a little, do you?

24:15.746 --> 24:18.156
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't understand your language

24:18.196 --> 24:23.441
But, is my brother okay?
Is he all right?

26:56.642 --> 26:58.742
Amazing!

27:04.133 --> 27:07.496
You navigate, and work the G.P.S., OK?

27:18.260 --> 27:21.543
You want to drive?
But do you know how to drive?

27:24.576 --> 27:26.406
I think I better, you know

27:32.265 --> 27:35.384
Nine o'clock. Turn this way!

28:38.923 --> 28:39.921
Okay. Just go straight ahead

28:41.087 --> 28:42.250
Aiji, how are you feeling?

28:43.080 --> 28:45.450
Feeling better. I.V. is helping

28:47.069 --> 28:47.611
Good!

29:14.873 --> 29:19.823
Please help us! We need a doctor!

29:26.551 --> 29:31.542
Look! Here's the driver!
Back a little bit! Back!

29:32.121 --> 29:33.450
He's very lucky

29:33.534 --> 29:36.233
The natural herbs on his leg
neutralized the poison

29:36.898 --> 29:42.340
and that coconut I. V... The only people
that use it are elite military units

29:42.758 --> 29:43.506
Who applied it?

29:44.047 --> 29:44.755
Here

29:46.662 --> 29:48.162
That's him over there

29:48.268 --> 29:50.323
Amazing. Very talented native!

29:50.905 --> 29:53.603
Say again? What? Give us a story!

29:53.771 --> 29:55.309
Where are you going?

29:56.348 --> 29:57.597
What?

30:00.835 --> 30:02.108
What's he on about?

30:02.166 --> 30:04.911
Oh, it's okay. Speak to him.
He understands English

30:26.849 --> 30:28.283
One of them is still alive

30:28.890 --> 30:29.571
What?

30:29.845 --> 30:31.399
He's all over the local paper

30:32.048 --> 30:33.979
I want to know
if any of the others survived

30:34.461 --> 30:36.558
I want every one of them liquidated

30:37.869 --> 30:38.801
Including this one

30:41.114 --> 30:44.372
That's a bit difficult with these,
C.I.A. Boys scout on my tail

30:45.271 --> 30:49.364
That's not your problem, Morgan.
We've other people to take care of that

30:49.843 --> 30:51.109
You just find him

31:10.549 --> 31:11.357
Who Am I?

31:12.206 --> 31:12.623
Yes

31:13.662 --> 31:14.594
I'm Christine Spaak

31:14.739 --> 31:16.532
I work for the South African Tribune

31:16.736 --> 31:20.234
I saw you on T. V... What a great story!
That was!

31:20.357 --> 31:22.986
I want to do an in-depth article on you

31:23.224 --> 31:23.642
Huh?

31:24.057 --> 31:26.086
I want to do an in-depth article on you

31:26.219 --> 31:29.203
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very busy right now.
Maybe some other day

31:29.335 --> 31:31.633
But you don't understand! You're a hero!

31:31.791 --> 31:34.744
Everybody wants to know who you are!

31:35.158 --> 31:36.617
They do?

31:36.739 --> 31:38.703
So do I

31:39.026 --> 31:40.621
Who Am I

31:40.979 --> 31:42.394
Excuse me

31:42.558 --> 31:45.720
Wait! The article. Wait!

31:46.717 --> 31:48.134
Wait, wait!

31:48.421 --> 31:50.238
Hi, Who Am I

31:50.542 --> 31:51.995
Don't you want to be a hero?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.576
Everybody wants to know
what happened in the rally

31:53.743 --> 31:55.741
Christine. Reporter

31:56.116 --> 31:57.089
How's your brother?

31:57.154 --> 32:00.232
Oh, he's going to be fine.
And the doctor's ready to see you

32:01.104 --> 32:03.576
I think she wants to interview you

32:04.140 --> 32:06.029
Oh? So you're the journalist? Yeah?

32:06.259 --> 32:09.164
You know my name?
My name is Yuki. It's Y-U-K-I

32:09.253 --> 32:13.992
Our x-rays show that you experienced
a severe blow in this area

32:14.410 --> 32:16.114
It's very sensitive

32:16.823 --> 32:20.115
It controls your reason,
logic and memory

32:20.229 --> 32:21.354
That's why you're feeling confused

32:21.769 --> 32:23.635
I'm not mixed up!

32:23.928 --> 32:26.001
But if I am, is there any cure?

32:26.092 --> 32:28.373
That's what they all want.
There is no immediate cure

32:28.505 --> 32:30.016
Why don't you contact the police?

32:30.083 --> 32:33.603
Perhaps Missing Persons will have some
information that will jog your memory

32:34.547 --> 32:35.556
So where are you going now?

32:35.715 --> 32:36.910
I'm going to the police station

32:37.126 --> 32:38.791
The police station?

32:41.159 --> 32:42.578
Yes

32:45.819 --> 32:47.116
- Okay
- I'll see you later then

32:47.232 --> 32:48.772
Yeah. Bye

33:04.906 --> 33:08.346
Did it work? Do you remember anything?

33:08.478 --> 33:09.474
- No!
- No?

33:10.432 --> 33:11.430
- Miss
- Yes?

33:11.763 --> 33:14.607
What do you think you're doing?
This is a hospital!

33:15.048 --> 33:18.461
I was just helping my patient. I'm sorry

33:19.625 --> 33:20.628
Excuse me, sir

33:21.035 --> 33:22.842
Agent Lee, C.I.A.

33:23.031 --> 33:23.841
C.I.A.?

33:24.030 --> 33:25.420
Our superior would like to
speak with you, just a moment

33:25.488 --> 33:28.221
- Me?
- Right

33:28.354 --> 33:33.254
Nothing serious. Just a quick chat.
Would you mind coming with us?

33:34.425 --> 33:35.883
Thank you

33:37.586 --> 33:42.124
Feel free to use this room.
It's all yours

33:54.261 --> 33:55.245
Are you looking for me?

33:55.551 --> 33:56.593
Yes, I am

33:56.968 --> 33:59.869
Who are you? Have we met before?

33:59.960 --> 34:01.499
Not that I recall

34:01.665 --> 34:04.081
Morgan, C.I.A.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.985
Chief operative, Southern Africa.
Pleased to meet you

34:11.393 --> 34:15.072
Have I done something wrong?
Do you know about my past?

34:15.222 --> 34:17.217
Yes, I do

34:17.924 --> 34:21.620
I know you came out of the desert.
I know you lost your memory

34:21.795 --> 34:23.598
And I believe you can help us

34:23.746 --> 34:25.860
with a highly classified investigation

34:26.326 --> 34:27.241
Me?

34:27.614 --> 34:30.187
Are you sure you saw eight graves?

34:30.440 --> 34:31.882
Yes, I'm sure

34:32.232 --> 34:35.608
And a skeleton hanging from a tree?

34:36.014 --> 34:39.052
Yes. From a parachute

34:39.342 --> 34:41.719
Good. This information
could be highly valuable to us

34:42.045 --> 34:44.574
Of course we'll have to verify it

34:45.040 --> 34:47.626
And remember, this is top secret

34:47.699 --> 34:51.060
Not a word to anyone. I mean, no one

34:51.110 --> 34:53.534
Yes, of course

34:54.313 --> 34:57.632
Mr. Morgan,
if you find out anything else about me

34:57.681 --> 34:59.581
Please let me know

34:59.752 --> 35:01.684
Sure. I'll be in touch

35:01.959 --> 35:02.458
Thank you

35:03.457 --> 35:05.412
Very soon

35:11.692 --> 35:13.686
523.

35:14.683 --> 35:17.102
Mean anything to you?

35:18.054 --> 35:19.716
What?

35:19.965 --> 35:24.544
Good. Keep well

35:34.665 --> 35:35.788
Close, but no cigar

35:36.245 --> 35:37.119
It's not him?

35:37.370 --> 35:38.951
No. Striking resemblance though

35:39.242 --> 35:41.654
Mr. Morgan, wait

35:42.071 --> 35:44.525
If I remember anything,
how can I contact you?

35:44.818 --> 35:45.856
You have a business card?

35:46.354 --> 35:47.395
I'm sorry. I don't

35:47.561 --> 35:49.268
Here. You can use mine

35:49.643 --> 35:50.058
No!

35:50.850 --> 35:53.636
Use this. It's better

35:54.346 --> 35:56.673
The C.I.A. Will put you
through immediately

35:56.967 --> 35:59.045
It's a phone card.
You can use it anywhere in the world

35:59.338 --> 36:00.043
Thank you

36:05.203 --> 36:06.661
The poor guy can't remember a thing

36:06.911 --> 36:08.115
So put him out of his misery

36:08.447 --> 36:11.526
I'll make sure he doesn't enjoy
the African sun. Leave it to me

36:20.181 --> 36:21.013
Move it along!

36:21.182 --> 36:24.175
We're at a very
delicate stage of testing

36:24.467 --> 36:25.757
The process should be gradual

36:26.172 --> 36:27.004
I can't guarantee...

36:27.170 --> 36:28.879
And I can't guarantee
your family's safety

36:29.170 --> 36:29.917
Now get it started!

36:30.167 --> 36:31.497
Work!

36:33.619 --> 36:34.493
Activate the accelerator!

36:36.450 --> 36:36.909
All set!

36:43.898 --> 36:45.688
How can a tiny fragment
power up a whole city?

36:46.311 --> 36:49.596
You don't understand
the power of this fragment!

36:49.845 --> 36:51.136
You! Keep working!

36:51.760 --> 36:52.842
Initiating bombardment!

36:53.707 --> 36:54.287
Watch the leve!

36:54.993 --> 36:55.950
225.

37:16.380 --> 37:16.962
What's the flow rate?

37:17.419 --> 37:19.374
Forty thousand joules and climbing!

37:20.707 --> 37:21.955
It's working! It's working!

37:35.933 --> 37:36.225
Yeah!

37:36.515 --> 37:37.474
Go! Check it out!

37:38.223 --> 37:39.053
What's going on?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.925
The voltage is too high!

37:45.876 --> 37:46.793
Abort! Abort!

37:46.958 --> 37:49.081
Don't abort! Keep going!

37:49.748 --> 37:51.036
We told you it was too soon!

37:51.453 --> 37:52.616
The core's expanding!

37:53.906 --> 37:55.736
Come on!

37:56.072 --> 37:56.903
Move it!

37:57.445 --> 37:58.527
Quick!

38:01.148 --> 38:02.770
Let's go

38:03.641 --> 38:04.434
Oh, my god!

38:10.340 --> 38:10.923
Move it!

38:57.384 --> 38:58.132
What was that?

38:58.426 --> 38:59.629
I don't know. Let's take a look

39:16.192 --> 39:19.228
Officer! Officer!

39:19.811 --> 39:20.518
Officer!

39:20.684 --> 39:23.896
Sergeant actually!

39:24.010 --> 39:24.966
Sergeant. What about my case?

39:25.015 --> 39:25.779
I've been waiting two hours

39:25.851 --> 39:28.349
I'll get to you when I can.
Everybody is waiting!

39:28.515 --> 39:30.679
The power station has just blown up,
and it's chaos everywhere!

39:31.286 --> 39:32.979
What are you doing
standing in front of me?

39:33.045 --> 39:35.370
If you're a missing person,
what are you doing here?

39:35.475 --> 39:36.449
Have you seen a doctor yet?

39:36.557 --> 39:38.578
I've already seen the doctor, officer

39:38.612 --> 39:40.339
Sergeant!

39:40.589 --> 39:42.209
Look, have a seat

39:42.416 --> 39:44.290
As soon as we have sorted out
the problem with computers,

39:44.322 --> 39:45.624
you'll be first on my list

39:45.950 --> 39:46.999
Okay?

39:47.138 --> 39:47.998
Pullen

39:48.029 --> 39:49.569
What?

39:49.669 --> 39:50.637
Yes, sir

39:58.932 --> 39:59.431
More coffee?

40:00.223 --> 40:02.255
No, thank you. Five is enough

40:02.548 --> 40:03.672
I insist

40:05.256 --> 40:05.800
Thank you

40:07.669 --> 40:08.831
What am I waiting for?

40:10.500 --> 40:11.664
Computers

40:27.389 --> 40:30.555
Thanks for popping in.
I've been dying to meet you

40:41.071 --> 40:41.780
What's going on?

40:42.196 --> 40:43.198
Internal Security!

40:43.447 --> 40:44.941
I've got a couple of questions,
I want to ask you

41:12.542 --> 41:13.261
Go!

41:23.246 --> 41:24.830
You two stay.
The rest of you come with me

41:27.414 --> 41:28.696
We have the suspect. Keep guard

41:30.697 --> 41:31.405
Get me the stuff

41:41.462 --> 41:42.169
Have a seat

41:47.493 --> 41:50.060
28th of March, you and your group

41:50.152 --> 41:52.452
spent the night
in this deserted exhibition hall

41:55.152 --> 41:58.359
On the 29th, your friends disappeared

41:59.521 --> 42:04.477
On 30 March, 3 very important scientists
from my country were kidnapped

42:04.727 --> 42:11.056
and their whereabouts is still a mystery
Where have you taken them?

42:12.506 --> 42:13.664
Now listen

42:14.005 --> 42:15.554
We witnessed five guys

42:15.717 --> 42:17.595
and the scientists at the power station

42:17.715 --> 42:20.550
Then, mysteriously it blew up

42:21.333 --> 42:22.559
Now if you're not a terroist,

42:22.603 --> 42:23.685
why the hell did you blow it up?

42:24.408 --> 42:26.744
Who are you working for?

42:31.318 --> 42:33.027
I don't know

42:35.917 --> 42:38.891
Now on the day
that our scientists were kidnapped

42:39.036 --> 42:41.465
We discovered extremely high-tech,

42:41.615 --> 42:43.087
lethal weaponry

42:43.254 --> 42:45.664
The likes of which
we've never been seen in Africa

42:45.840 --> 42:48.420
Now only a first world country
has got the money

42:48.590 --> 42:50.293
and the technology
to make something like that

42:51.581 --> 42:56.624
So, I want to know from you, my friend,
who are you working for?

42:56.825 --> 42:59.992
The Japanese, the Chinese,
or the Americans?

43:03.277 --> 43:04.568
Or maybe somebody else?

43:05.276 --> 43:08.937
And tell me "Eleven done one too many."
What does this mean ?

43:10.936 --> 43:11.809
I don't know who saved my life

43:12.146 --> 43:13.686
But I thank you

43:13.935 --> 43:14.927
Yvirorich, Russian

43:15.221 --> 43:15.804
Jakol, Isreal

43:16.384 --> 43:18.222
Hans, German

43:19.384 --> 43:20.387
And you, what's your name?

43:20.671 --> 43:23.087
I'm Paul, France

43:23.546 --> 43:24.964
Muhamad, I'm Malaysian

43:25.253 --> 43:26.212
Yubicha, Thai

43:26.830 --> 43:27.665
Tachi, Japan

43:28.206 --> 43:29.539
Dick Sing, Korea

43:30.247 --> 43:31.952
My name is...

43:32.077 --> 43:34.533
Gentlemen,
what a great combination we've got here

43:39.525 --> 43:40.527
Who are you?

43:41.149 --> 43:42.108
You want to know who I am?

43:43.065 --> 43:44.982
I want to know who I am

43:47.351 --> 43:49.270
We found 54 different passports

43:50.518 --> 43:53.389
That makes 6 for each of you. Why?

43:54.515 --> 43:58.095
Where are your friends?
Who are your friends?

44:01.423 --> 44:03.504
Well, there's no point
trying to cover for your friends

44:04.383 --> 44:09.373
And don't you think you're in deep
trouble now, you ain't smelt nothing yet?

44:11.662 --> 44:12.493
Talk to me. Now!

44:15.036 --> 44:15.784
They're all dead

44:32.499 --> 44:33.584
Quite a tough guy!

44:34.875 --> 44:36.495
We know about your special training

44:37.201 --> 44:40.202
But we've got special ways
to make tough guys like you crack

44:42.196 --> 44:43.196
I'm waiting

44:44.947 --> 44:47.276
I told you, it's no use

44:48.190 --> 44:51.022
I lost all my memory

44:52.192 --> 44:54.892
With this attitude, you're going to
lose more than just your memory

44:55.725 --> 44:58.891
Get my drift? Book him.
On terrorism, espionage

44:59.139 --> 44:59.722
and attempted murder

45:01.470 --> 45:04.762
If any of his friends arrive,
I'd like to have a little chat with them

45:05.177 --> 45:06.176
Let's go, smart ass!

45:25.284 --> 45:25.984
What's happening in here?

45:34.271 --> 45:36.519
You idiots! He was handcuffed! That way!

46:15.067 --> 46:16.063
Go around the back!

46:54.465 --> 46:55.214
How did he do this?

46:57.383 --> 46:58.755
Don't just stand there.
We're losing him!

47:09.202 --> 47:10.741
Thank you, I'll be back

47:12.907 --> 47:13.945
He's on his way in

47:20.731 --> 47:21.605
Room 1954

47:22.066 --> 47:23.063
- Certainly, sir
- Thank you

47:23.354 --> 47:26.308
Who Am I, Christine,
South African Tribune. Remember me?

47:26.850 --> 47:28.144
Here, take one of my cards

47:29.058 --> 47:30.468
I finally found you!

47:30.717 --> 47:32.468
It's amazing
how hard it is to track you down

47:32.635 --> 47:33.637
My editor's been asking...

47:33.761 --> 47:35.012
Excuse me. Could you do me a favor?

47:35.302 --> 47:37.922
My taxi's waiting outside.
Can you pay for it?

47:38.171 --> 47:39.172
Then the interview. Okay?

47:40.005 --> 47:42.631
OK, no problem. But remember the deal

47:43.000 --> 47:47.001
The interview as soon as I get back.
I trust you

47:48.706 --> 47:49.824
Check her out

47:57.443 --> 47:58.693
Thank you

47:59.613 --> 48:01.110
Police, step aside, please

48:01.277 --> 48:03.189
Police? I didn't even see your I.D.!

48:20.485 --> 48:22.529
1954

49:30.278 --> 49:31.678
He's gone that way!

49:47.981 --> 49:48.976
What did you give him?

49:49.101 --> 49:51.102
My card. I told you I'm a reporter

49:51.561 --> 49:52.646
I'm doing a story on him

49:52.729 --> 49:53.937
Sure. Story. Right

50:31.225 --> 50:31.809
Come in, come in

50:35.096 --> 50:35.802
What's going on?

51:09.030 --> 51:10.574
What?

51:10.652 --> 51:12.356
Go! Go! Go!

51:13.521 --> 51:15.315
Stop!

51:16.897 --> 51:17.719
Start the car!

51:18.017 --> 51:20.644
How?

51:22.762 --> 51:24.641
I'll shift the gears!

51:24.806 --> 51:25.480
What?

51:25.512 --> 51:26.783
What's going on?

51:27.764 --> 51:28.722
Come in!

51:29.511 --> 51:30.801
Wait! Are you crazy?

51:30.925 --> 51:34.802
Slow down, come on! I'm not in yet!

51:36.918 --> 51:40.364
Come on, move it, get on!

51:44.023 --> 51:45.673
Third, fourth gear

51:45.813 --> 51:47.597
Which gear you run?

51:47.781 --> 51:48.607
I don't know

51:48.666 --> 51:50.803
Look out!

51:56.612 --> 51:58.570
Watch out!

52:00.859 --> 52:01.148
Be careful!

52:40.248 --> 52:41.959
You stop messing the gear!

52:42.124 --> 52:43.123
Find a better road!

52:43.541 --> 52:44.704
Let me

52:45.328 --> 52:45.618
Go! Go! Go!

53:00.361 --> 53:01.606
Oh, no! We can't move!

53:06.938 --> 53:07.642
Do you know how to drive?

53:07.769 --> 53:09.683
What do you expect? I only have one arm

53:11.183 --> 53:11.766
Move, I drive

53:12.807 --> 53:13.596
We're stuck!

53:14.516 --> 53:16.221
Don't worry, I can figure out

53:18.386 --> 53:19.967
Do something. They're right behind!

53:55.021 --> 53:55.729
Back to the car

54:17.837 --> 54:19.630
Car 54, in pursuit

54:20.004 --> 54:20.638
Hey! Watch out!

54:20.752 --> 54:22.380
I'm driving

54:24.749 --> 54:25.597
The police! We're saved!

54:25.703 --> 54:26.931
Good!

54:27.039 --> 54:28.413
No! Even the police are after me!

54:28.497 --> 54:29.557
Why? What have you done?

54:29.623 --> 54:32.616
Just keep going!

54:41.697 --> 54:42.421
You're great!

54:42.482 --> 54:44.193
Piece of cake

54:47.438 --> 54:48.983
They're back there!

54:57.863 --> 54:59.616
It's a dead end!

55:01.865 --> 55:02.695
Not again!

55:03.106 --> 55:03.696
What was that?

55:05.819 --> 55:07.151
Nothing, just sit tight!

55:18.401 --> 55:20.566
Next time warn us about seat belts!

55:20.853 --> 55:21.312
Sorry!

55:21.606 --> 55:22.977
Sorry? Christine, are you okay?

55:24.981 --> 55:27.853
I'm all right, but they're
right behind us! Get us out of here!

55:28.269 --> 55:30.558
Push me up

55:37.308 --> 55:39.594
Let me show you what I'v got

55:43.722 --> 55:44.677
They're behind us!

55:51.382 --> 55:52.128
Come on, let's go, that way!

56:29.525 --> 56:31.149
We're gonna go over! Lean to the right!

56:31.523 --> 56:31.941
We gotta help them!

56:32.235 --> 56:32.649
OK

56:37.770 --> 56:38.647
Come out! Hurry up!

56:41.561 --> 56:41.977
Thank you

56:42.268 --> 56:43.394
Don't thank him! Grab him!

56:54.762 --> 56:55.263
Sorry

57:01.678 --> 57:02.683
You've gotta trust me

57:02.797 --> 57:03.758
Will this work?

57:04.382 --> 57:04.802
Yes. Good!

57:06.383 --> 57:07.779
So why are those guys after you?

57:07.841 --> 57:08.746
Everybody's after me

57:09.422 --> 57:12.285
C.I.A., Secret Police, even you

57:12.505 --> 57:13.826
You must be hiding something

57:14.212 --> 57:15.741
Hiding what?

57:15.961 --> 57:17.602
You must have stolen
something from them.

57:17.669 --> 57:18.383
Where is it?

57:18.500 --> 57:19.764
Where is what?

57:20.082 --> 57:21.797
I don't know! Try to remember

57:22.039 --> 57:23.646
How did you do that so quick?

57:23.748 --> 57:27.665
All I remember is I've got 6 passports

57:28.656 --> 57:32.072
6 passports? No fingerprints? Amazing!

57:32.322 --> 57:34.068
But this is not you. Who is this?

57:34.364 --> 57:35.654
I got it from the dead body

57:35.906 --> 57:38.027
Dead body? What a great story! Christine

57:38.196 --> 57:39.152
It's not a story!

57:39.776 --> 57:41.194
Eleven done one too many.

57:41.359 --> 57:42.025
What does this mean?

57:42.194 --> 57:45.064
- It's a puzzle.
- Eleven done one too many

57:45.189 --> 57:46.355
You remember something, don't you?

57:46.604 --> 57:47.190
Tell me!

57:47.480 --> 57:48.732
I used to be good at that

57:52.726 --> 57:54.476
Someone bring my memory back

57:56.059 --> 57:56.802
What are you doing?

57:57.140 --> 57:58.543
I'm trying to help him!

57:58.765 --> 58:00.699
Don't you remember?
The doctor said it would help

58:00.766 --> 58:01.765
I told you! Never do that again!

58:09.759 --> 58:17.009
Who am I?

58:47.741 --> 58:50.914
We ran into a slight snag. We lost him

58:50.993 --> 58:53.322
I suggest you find him. Quickly!

58:53.571 --> 58:55.196
He's lost his memory.
What harm can he do us?

58:56.197 --> 58:58.444
You ever heard of short term amnesia,
you idiot?

58:59.155 --> 58:59.983
What do you want me to do?

59:00.109 --> 59:01.858
What you were supposed to do
in the first place. Kill him!

59:02.276 --> 59:02.817
Right

59:05.233 --> 59:06.857
Africa's a bit bigger than Washington

59:08.398 --> 59:10.563
Are you sure you want a piece?
Very juicy

59:11.939 --> 59:13.312
Guys! I've broken the code!

59:13.561 --> 59:15.434
It's a phone number.
A company in Rotterdam!

59:15.976 --> 59:16.686
Rotterdam?

59:16.976 --> 59:17.391
Yeah!

59:17.852 --> 59:18.557
How do you know?

59:18.807 --> 59:19.975
Eleven dEleven done one too many.

59:20.809 --> 59:22.392
The letters stand for
numbers on a phone key pad

59:23.933 --> 59:26.969
The first number
is the international code, zero eleven

59:27.221 --> 59:29.511
then the country and city codes.
Don't you see?

59:29.802 --> 59:33.552
Done is d-one, right?
So look, d is three and one is one

59:33.676 --> 59:34.259
31, the Netherlands!

59:34.845 --> 59:35.674
Okay

59:35.841 --> 59:36.966
The company's name is Heinex Holdings

59:37.213 --> 59:38.846
But all I got
was their answering machine

59:39.261 --> 59:41.391
Sounds great! But I still don't get it

59:41.681 --> 59:43.389
Where did you learn
to break codes like that?

59:43.512 --> 59:45.259
Spy novels. I'm addicted to them

59:46.841 --> 59:48.135
They could know my past.

59:48.384 --> 59:49.094
I have to go there

59:49.387 --> 59:50.423
You mean we have to go there?

59:50.843 --> 59:52.674
You promised me a story, remember?

59:52.839 --> 59:55.129
Besides,
the newspaper will pay our expenses

59:55.299 --> 59:57.132
Okay. But you go at your own risk

59:57.712 --> 01:00:00.380
It sounds so exciting.
I wish I could come with you

01:00:01.422 --> 01:00:03.129
Hey, let's take a picture
for my African scrapbook

01:00:04.417 --> 01:00:04.834
No!

01:00:07.669 --> 01:00:08.499
What's wrong?

01:00:10.289 --> 01:00:11.414
Something wrong?

01:00:13.956 --> 01:00:15.955
I tried to scare him, just like you did

01:00:18.244 --> 01:00:19.949
That was a good one!

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:21.244
I got you

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:22.409
Did it work?

01:00:22.657 --> 01:00:25.078
Anyway, this one's out of film.
Let's try the other one

01:00:25.284 --> 01:00:28.780
Forget it. Yuki, thank you very much.
We'll keep in touch

01:00:29.698 --> 01:00:30.655
Say goodbye to your brother

01:00:31.242 --> 01:00:31.698
Let's go

01:00:32.697 --> 01:00:33.487
Where are you headed?

01:00:34.067 --> 01:00:34.985
Airport

01:00:35.234 --> 01:00:36.111
You're going to walk?

01:00:38.275 --> 01:00:39.568
I'll drive!

01:00:40.398 --> 01:00:41.149
Good idea

01:00:42.399 --> 01:00:43.859
What's wrong with my driving?

01:00:45.858 --> 01:00:48.522
Rotterdam, Holland

01:01:17.288 --> 01:01:17.990
This is the place

01:01:18.701 --> 01:01:20.864
The encoded phone number belongs to
that building over there

01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:21.992
Did you talk to anybody?

01:01:22.282 --> 01:01:23.157
- Yes
- Who?

01:01:23.407 --> 01:01:24.237
The operator

01:01:24.362 --> 01:01:24.866
Then what?

01:01:25.405 --> 01:01:26.363
I just hung up

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:27.361
You hung up?

01:01:27.529 --> 01:01:30.732
Who am I supposed to talk to? There must
be over a hundred companies in there

01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:37.833
The number is right

01:01:38.668 --> 01:01:41.541
The matches from the dead body
are also from this restaurant

01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:43.832
He must have been here

01:01:43.999 --> 01:01:45.996
That's obvious. So what do we do now?

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:50.451
Shall we just walk in and take a look?

01:01:50.827 --> 01:01:52.954
I don't think so.
The place is heavily guarded

01:01:53.162 --> 01:01:55.115
Even the police would have a hard time
getting in there

01:02:01.032 --> 01:02:01.655
Where are you going?

01:02:02.572 --> 01:02:03.527
I've got to make a phone call

01:02:03.655 --> 01:02:04.986
Here. Use mine

01:02:05.987 --> 01:02:08.232
No. I'll use the pay phone.
Reception's better

01:02:19.397 --> 01:02:19.977
Mr. Morgan

01:02:20.272 --> 01:02:21.106
Hello? Who's that?

01:02:21.272 --> 01:02:23.561
It's Who Am I. Remember me?

01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:26.683
Yes, of course. How could I forget?

01:02:26.848 --> 01:02:28.643
I found out something very important

01:02:28.934 --> 01:02:29.517
Yeah? What's that?

01:02:31.389 --> 01:02:32.392
Are you there?

01:02:35.013 --> 01:02:37.098
A building. Maybe their headquarters

01:02:38.639 --> 01:02:39.513
Whose headquarters?

01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:41.260
The people trying to kill me

01:02:41.385 --> 01:02:43.261
I'm at the coffee shop across the street

01:02:43.842 --> 01:02:46.673
And whereabouts in South Africa
is this building?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.299
No. I'm in Rotterdam!

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.799
He's across the road

01:02:51.007 --> 01:02:51.546
What?

01:02:59.795 --> 01:03:01.379
Hello? Are you there?

01:03:01.669 --> 01:03:03.543
Yeah. I'm here

01:03:03.858 --> 01:03:05.158
OK, don't do anything

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:07.424
Give me 30 minutes to arrange
back up for you, then call me

01:03:07.497 --> 01:03:08.373
I need more information

01:03:08.538 --> 01:03:09.121
OK

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.993
And remember, don't trust anyone.
Got it?

01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:15.243
Hey, are you listening?

01:03:15.367 --> 01:03:15.994
Yes

01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:24.783
What's going on?

01:03:24.948 --> 01:03:26.966
Our native friend's in the coffee shop
across the street

01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:28.256
Take your men and finish him off

01:03:28.424 --> 01:03:29.005
Who?

01:03:29.254 --> 01:03:30.502
Our African friend

01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:31.501
What do you mean? The coffee sho...

01:03:31.711 --> 01:03:33.005
And don't blow it this time

01:03:33.295 --> 01:03:34.254
OK! Go!

01:03:35.706 --> 01:03:36.665
Peter, wait!

01:03:36.832 --> 01:03:38.706
Don't kill him! Bring him back here

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.122
Yes, sir

01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:42.539
I need to find out what he knows

01:04:15.229 --> 01:04:17.448
Yeah, I'm here. Okay, don't do anything

01:04:17.686 --> 01:04:20.187
Give me 30 minutes to arrange
back up for you, then call me

01:04:20.476 --> 01:04:21.352
I need more information

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.766
And remember. Don't trust anyone

01:04:31.973 --> 01:04:32.472
Listen to me!

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:42.650
Why are you tapping my phone calls?

01:04:42.759 --> 01:04:43.840
I'm a reporter, remember?

01:04:44.216 --> 01:04:45.505
What kind of reporter uses this?

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:48.842
The best!
I'll do anything to get the story!

01:04:49.548 --> 01:04:50.537
Anything?

01:04:50.668 --> 01:04:56.809
Yes. Anything

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:15.367
Quick!

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:27.795
Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I crossed the line

01:05:28.128 --> 01:05:31.505
But I'm not the one
you should be worrying about

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:33.380
Maybe your friend on the phone
is lying to you

01:05:33.545 --> 01:05:34.668
No. He's C.I.A.

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:38.540
Every organization
has people on the take

01:05:49.784 --> 01:05:51.241
Look, I didn't mean to offend you

01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:52.656
Here. You can have the tape

01:06:09.526 --> 01:06:10.188
Let me explain!

01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:12.773
This is a gun! You're not a reporter!

01:06:13.649 --> 01:06:15.190
Now I know
how you broke the code so easily

01:06:15.482 --> 01:06:16.478
And opened the handcuffs!

01:06:16.938 --> 01:06:18.811
Who are you? What do you want?

01:06:19.019 --> 01:06:19.683
Listen to me!

01:06:20.354 --> 01:06:21.354
Who are you?

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.226
All right

01:06:22.682 --> 01:06:25.764
I haven't been totally honest with you,
but it was for your own protection

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:28.059
I'm with the C.I.A.

01:06:31.802 --> 01:06:32.928
Now you're C.I.A.

01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:34.677
Yes, but I'm on your side!

01:06:35.051 --> 01:06:36.053
Nobody's on my side!

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.883
You call anybody in the bathroom?
Who were you calling?

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:47.462
What are you talking about?

01:06:49.045 --> 01:06:50.170
You set me up!

01:07:06.036 --> 01:07:07.787
You, round the back!

01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:42.581
I've got him! Come here to help!

01:08:05.899 --> 01:08:06.859
Think you can get away?

01:08:33.055 --> 01:08:33.635
Excuse me

01:08:57.416 --> 01:08:58.582
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

01:08:59.037 --> 01:09:00.165
What's going on here?

01:09:00.497 --> 01:09:02.415
Mind your own business!

01:09:03.163 --> 01:09:04.453
Hey, you can't do that!

01:10:05.776 --> 01:10:06.901
Feels good?

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:19.185
Get him!

01:10:41.463 --> 01:10:42.256
Stop! Don't move!

01:10:58.578 --> 01:10:59.332
Don't shoot!

01:11:20.297 --> 01:11:21.756
Here, Sweetie

01:12:00.957 --> 01:12:02.994
Donation, Save The Children Fund

01:12:05.468 --> 01:12:06.512
Mr. Morgan?

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.468
Who Am I?

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.342
You're right. Someone's after me

01:12:11.467 --> 01:12:13.176
My men couldn't find you
at the coffee shop

01:12:13.757 --> 01:12:14.384
What happened?

01:12:15.762 --> 01:12:17.343
I had to leave. Where are you?

01:12:17.593 --> 01:12:18.803
I'm on my way to Rotterdam

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:20.633
You stay put. Where are you?

01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:22.509
How long till you get here?

01:12:22.757 --> 01:12:25.176
3 to 4 hours.
I'll commandeer a military jet

01:12:25.881 --> 01:12:26.591
Where are you?

01:12:30.299 --> 01:12:31.004
I'll call you then

01:12:35.046 --> 01:12:36.214
So why don't we just kill him?

01:12:36.754 --> 01:12:39.005
Because we still don't know
what he's found out

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.923
The buyer's coming this afternoon

01:12:41.212 --> 01:12:44.585
When the transaction's complete,
we'll have nothing to fear from him

01:12:45.797 --> 01:12:48.752
You take care of
the three Einsteins upstairs

01:12:49.045 --> 01:12:51.334
When the deal's history, so are they

01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:53.461
I want that lab pristine

01:12:53.753 --> 01:12:55.335
And no evidence left in the building

01:12:55.597 --> 01:12:56.516
It's being dealt with

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.498
Hey, Mr. Armano

01:14:40.245 --> 01:14:41.330
Hey, nice joint you got here

01:14:42.495 --> 01:14:43.618
I'm getting to like Rotterdam

01:14:44.329 --> 01:14:46.784
I see the General's got security
nice and tight

01:14:47.453 --> 01:14:48.616
Yeah. And he's been expecting you

01:15:16.335 --> 01:15:16.796
Oh, sorry!

01:15:39.081 --> 01:15:40.912
Over here. This entry point. And here

01:15:41.163 --> 01:15:43.662
I want 24 hours surveillance.
Effective immediately

01:15:43.955 --> 01:15:44.495
Yes, ma'am

01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:57.536
Hey, what are you doing?

01:16:28.029 --> 01:16:30.363
So that happened to the power station

01:16:31.235 --> 01:16:33.025
That rock is really something

01:16:37.943 --> 01:16:40.025
Now that's what
I call quality advertising

01:16:40.484 --> 01:16:44.245
Can you imagine the amount of energy
produced by these fragments?

01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:46.955
My client prefers reality to imagination

01:16:47.456 --> 01:16:49.496
That's why we're not giving you
all the money up front

01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:53.914
But I would say that half a billion
dollars is more than enough motivation

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.371
for you to deliver a quality product

01:16:55.536 --> 01:16:58.076
Mr. Nelson is not giving charity

01:16:58.371 --> 01:17:00.205
Believe me, he's getting a bargain

01:17:00.497 --> 01:17:03.205
He's only paid one third of the cost
of the research project in South Africa

01:17:03.496 --> 01:17:05.368
and he's getting a complete product

01:17:05.785 --> 01:17:08.660
They're bringing the scientists
and the merchandise right up

01:17:10.657 --> 01:17:12.076
Bring in another pot of hot coffee

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.906
So you take 20% on the deal, Armano?

01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:46.485
Frank, I'm just a poor boy
trying to make a living

01:17:49.653 --> 01:17:53.361
This disc contains the only
remaining information about the formula

01:17:54.233 --> 01:17:57.234
The rest of the research files
have been completely deleted

01:17:57.608 --> 01:18:00.647
And keep in mind that
we still do not have all the knowledge

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.484
to control the energy
expansion completely

01:18:02.776 --> 01:18:05.108
Yes, sir. That's a problem

01:18:05.316 --> 01:18:07.234
We need more time to solve this problem

01:18:07.523 --> 01:18:08.232
Once we solve it

01:18:08.356 --> 01:18:11.356
the energy could be used for
a positive purpose

01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:12.232
He's right

01:18:12.483 --> 01:18:13.691
That's very considerate, gentlemen

01:18:14.772 --> 01:18:16.896
but we had something
a little bit different in mind

01:18:17.395 --> 01:18:19.771
Can you imagine, an ordinary machine gun

01:18:19.939 --> 01:18:22.896
with the destructive force
of a ballistic missile?

01:18:25.228 --> 01:18:29.394
You promise us that you should not
use the formula for destruction

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.393
We've already spoken about
your daughter, Manfred!

01:18:31.642 --> 01:18:32.229
Wait a minute!

01:18:32.518 --> 01:18:35.642
And now, you sell it to arms dealers.
Yes. That's it!

01:18:35.768 --> 01:18:36.784
Take these gentlemen away

01:18:37.075 --> 01:18:38.949
Seems they've overexerted themselves

01:18:40.945 --> 01:18:42.946
This Mr. Nelson of yours
is not only a very astute man

01:18:43.073 --> 01:18:44.905
but he's also going to be very rich

01:18:45.074 --> 01:18:47.361
because everybody's going top
want this weaponry

01:18:48.238 --> 01:18:51.695
Can you believe this little piece
of plastic costs billions of dollars?

01:18:55.946 --> 01:18:57.066
Champagne is ready outside, sir

01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:01.946
Why don't you take our friend here
with you and show him our hospitality

01:19:04.358 --> 01:19:05.610
Yes, sir

01:19:11.402 --> 01:19:13.941
It's so hard to find a good help
you can trust these days

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:14.941
Yes

01:19:23.774 --> 01:19:25.692
Six, seven, eight zeros

01:19:25.981 --> 01:19:28.816
Don't make a mistake. One zero makes
a hell of a lot of difference

01:19:29.522 --> 01:19:31.353
I don't play around
when it comes to money

01:19:32.938 --> 01:19:36.688
You know when I press this enter,
all that money's going to be yours

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:38.354
Let me

01:19:39.895 --> 01:19:42.062
Your request is being processed.
Please wait.

01:19:48.937 --> 01:19:50.892
Look at this.
They call this swift banking

01:19:51.101 --> 01:19:52.102
and I still got to wait

01:19:52.351 --> 01:19:52.890
Come on!

01:19:53.685 --> 01:19:54.683
Calm down!

01:19:54.808 --> 01:19:56.936
You waited this long,
what's a few minutes?

01:19:57.266 --> 01:19:58.101
I need a drink

01:19:58.642 --> 01:20:00.474
I'm the one
who should be worried about this

01:20:00.639 --> 01:20:01.517
General

01:20:01.974 --> 01:20:04.518
I still think there's too many people
that know about this

01:20:05.099 --> 01:20:05.974
What do you think?

01:20:06.474 --> 01:20:07.181
Relax!

01:20:07.559 --> 01:20:11.097
The commandos involved in the mission
all met with a tragic accident

01:20:11.264 --> 01:20:14.472
Oh yeah? Well according to my sources,
there was one survivor

01:20:16.346 --> 01:20:17.636
He doesn't even know who he is

01:20:17.927 --> 01:20:19.930
And by tomorrow, he won't exist

01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:24.804
And our three learned gentlemen
will be disposed of along with their lab

01:20:25.803 --> 01:20:28.345
Well, why wait? We got the disc.
Why not do it right now?

01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:37.357
Yung, take care of the three gentlemen

01:20:37.647 --> 01:20:38.105
Yes, sir

01:20:40.356 --> 01:20:42.397
Your statement worries me a little

01:20:42.687 --> 01:20:44.520
What? Am I going to be the next to go?

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:47.937
That's right. You did send me the five
hundred million dollars, didn't you?

01:20:50.269 --> 01:20:53.937
I'm joking. I was kidding.
We're friends, Armano

01:20:56.103 --> 01:20:57.396
Now look! Friendship!

01:20:59.102 --> 01:21:00.102
Friendship!

01:21:03.393 --> 01:21:05.227
Save The Children Fund

01:21:18.682 --> 01:21:19.391
Coffee?

01:21:19.807 --> 01:21:20.471
Yes, coffee

01:21:21.055 --> 01:21:22.682
Coffee, coffee

01:21:32.927 --> 01:21:33.805
How's it going?

01:21:36.677 --> 01:21:37.384
We have a dress code. Tidy up

01:21:43.759 --> 01:21:44.844
Congratulations, General

01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:46.094
All in good time

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.219
Transaction aborted.

01:21:49.384 --> 01:21:51.093
What's the matter? Not enough zeros?

01:21:51.966 --> 01:21:55.090
That's funny. It's not on my screen

01:21:55.966 --> 01:21:58.757
What are you talking about?
I just forwarded it from our account

01:21:58.966 --> 01:21:59.799
Here, take a look

01:22:00.217 --> 01:22:02.505
The name of my account
is Heinex Holdings

01:22:02.798 --> 01:22:03.674
So what?

01:22:03.797 --> 01:22:05.505
It's not in Heinex Holdings

01:22:05.674 --> 01:22:08.798
It's in Save The Children Fund!

01:22:14.504 --> 01:22:17.043
Donation received. Thank you very much.

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.085
No!

01:22:24.223 --> 01:22:25.806
Somebody's been messing
with my computer!

01:22:26.097 --> 01:22:27.263
Someone sneaked in!
Knocked out one of our guys!

01:22:27.512 --> 01:22:29.806
It's him! Seal off the building!
Floor to floor search!

01:22:29.973 --> 01:22:30.972
Find him! Kill him!

01:22:31.641 --> 01:22:32.222
He's in the building!

01:22:32.387 --> 01:22:33.223
Who's in the building?

01:22:33.347 --> 01:22:34.931
What? He's in the building?

01:22:35.221 --> 01:22:37.261
That's it! This is a set up

01:22:37.391 --> 01:22:39.387
You guys are trying to set me up,
aren't you?

01:22:40.095 --> 01:22:40.515
Yes, sir

01:22:41.386 --> 01:22:42.929
That's the man! Right there!
That's the man!

01:22:43.053 --> 01:22:44.139
When you were pouring the coffee

01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:45.553
you were messing with my computer,
weren't you?

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.805
No! It was your own man!

01:22:46.971 --> 01:22:47.512
My man?

01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:48.677
Shut up! Where is he?

01:22:48.804 --> 01:22:49.634
Just outside!

01:22:59.511 --> 01:23:00.798
Go down. Search the kitchen!

01:23:03.931 --> 01:23:04.917
Don't worry

01:23:06.432 --> 01:23:07.231
I'll find him

01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:10.719
The scientists! We can't kill them now!
Stop them!

01:23:12.849 --> 01:23:14.723
Save the children. I hate children

01:23:15.012 --> 01:23:18.054
I want this building secure from top to
bottom. Seal off all the escape routes

01:23:18.222 --> 01:23:19.058
And check the ventilation system

01:23:20.137 --> 01:23:21.054
Groups of three

01:23:21.178 --> 01:23:22.597
Stay alert. He's a special operative

01:23:23.052 --> 01:23:25.012
A million dollars to the team
that kills him

01:23:25.432 --> 01:23:26.220
Now get going

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:27.139
Yes, sir

01:23:29.468 --> 01:23:30.802
I'm depending on you two

01:23:31.052 --> 01:23:31.598
Yes, sir

01:23:34.473 --> 01:23:37.178
Right. Before this goes any further,
I want my disc back

01:23:37.598 --> 01:23:39.179
Are you still trying to
pull something on me?

01:23:39.345 --> 01:23:41.763
You think I'm some little punk,
you can just push around?

01:23:41.928 --> 01:23:44.182
What's the matter?
Are you getting senile before your time?

01:23:44.431 --> 01:23:45.929
Don't you remember? I gave you the disc.

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.139
Like this

01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:48.804
You gave me the disc?

01:23:48.929 --> 01:23:50.887
Well, I gave you the disc back.
Just like this

01:23:51.178 --> 01:23:52.472
You have it on you. Don't you?

01:23:52.596 --> 01:23:54.053
Get your greasy hands off me!

01:23:58.473 --> 01:24:00.428
That's the guy
who was pouring me coffee!

01:24:01.721 --> 01:24:02.598
It's him!

01:24:03.013 --> 01:24:03.470
Him who?

01:24:03.637 --> 01:24:04.764
Get out of my way!

01:24:05.933 --> 01:24:07.052
Get the men here!

01:24:07.347 --> 01:24:08.890
Boss, what's the matter? Can you repeat?

01:24:16.512 --> 01:24:17.927
You missed! What an idiot!

01:24:20.317 --> 01:24:23.359
And you shortstuff. You got my disc!

01:24:24.066 --> 01:24:24.944
Is this what you want?

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.526
You got a fraction of a second to give
that disc back to it's rightful owner

01:24:26.775 --> 01:24:28.524
or I'm going to break your little...

01:24:28.649 --> 01:24:30.359
Don't talk! Kill him!

01:24:30.484 --> 01:24:31.235
You shut up! I got it under control

01:24:31.443 --> 01:24:32.107
What's the matter with your mind?

01:24:37.319 --> 01:24:38.481
Because of this?

01:24:39.234 --> 01:24:43.610
You stole and kidnapped,
and killed nine good men! All for this?

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.316
Why do you want to destroy life?

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.943
When you can make it better?

01:24:50.067 --> 01:24:50.773
What do you want?

01:24:51.026 --> 01:24:51.609
Nothing

01:24:53.193 --> 01:24:54.192
I want my life back!

01:24:55.943 --> 01:24:56.772
He's over here!

01:24:57.063 --> 01:24:59.524
Get the disc and kill him!

01:25:00.941 --> 01:25:01.814
The children thank you

01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:08.485
General, are you okay?

01:25:08.899 --> 01:25:09.900
Call an ambulance!

01:25:10.357 --> 01:25:11.064
Get that disc!

01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:12.648
Come on. Yes, sir

01:25:22.105 --> 01:25:22.648
He's down there!

01:25:54.647 --> 01:25:55.233
Don't move!

01:25:56.354 --> 01:25:56.939
Who Am I?

01:25:57.482 --> 01:25:59.063
Morgan! It's you!

01:25:59.229 --> 01:26:00.772
Of course, it's me!
I've been trying to find you!

01:26:00.938 --> 01:26:02.519
You've come to kill me!
You're one of them!

01:26:02.646 --> 01:26:04.355
What are you talking about?
I've come to get you out

01:26:04.483 --> 01:26:05.896
You're lying. What are you doing here?

01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:08.190
I'm working undercover

01:26:08.355 --> 01:26:10.772
It's taken me two years to get into
Sharman's organization

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.536
I'm this close to nailing him!

01:26:13.784 --> 01:26:16.534
Yeah. I guess you saw me
in the conference room

01:26:16.948 --> 01:26:18.785
Once the money goes through, he's mine

01:26:19.534 --> 01:26:20.993
I sent the money to the children's fund

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:21.786
You what?

01:26:23.993 --> 01:26:25.534
You know what you've done?

01:26:25.659 --> 01:26:27.952
You've blown a two year investigation!

01:26:29.409 --> 01:26:31.536
The disc!
You must have had access to the disc

01:26:32.911 --> 01:26:33.909
Have you got it?

01:26:34.535 --> 01:26:35.617
Yes

01:26:36.534 --> 01:26:38.535
Good. It's crucial evidence.

01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:40.116
You keep it

01:26:42.245 --> 01:26:43.366
Now, let's get you out of here

01:26:44.117 --> 01:26:47.285
Wait a minute.
Your men found me at the coffee shop

01:26:47.949 --> 01:26:49.489
I never told you where I was

01:26:49.952 --> 01:26:52.284
Of course they found you.
Remember the calling card I gave you?

01:26:52.493 --> 01:26:53.661
It's got a microchip in it

01:26:53.826 --> 01:26:55.616
It gives your location
every time you use it

01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:56.994
They tried to kill me!

01:26:57.201 --> 01:26:58.203
They weren't my men

01:26:58.285 --> 01:26:59.950
By the time my men got there,
you were gone

01:27:00.952 --> 01:27:02.660
Sharman must be tapping my phone!

01:27:03.076 --> 01:27:04.658
Look, if I'd wanted to kill you

01:27:04.783 --> 01:27:05.951
I could have done that in South Africa

01:27:13.951 --> 01:27:16.242
Sharman must have sent the hit men
after you in Johannesburg

01:27:16.828 --> 01:27:19.075
But don't worry, we'll take care of them

01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:29.368
Look, I know you're confused

01:27:29.825 --> 01:27:31.242
You don't know who to trust

01:27:31.782 --> 01:27:34.409
Like I said before, don't trust anyone

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.116
You've got the disc. You keep it

01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:44.493
Now, let's get you out of here

01:27:54.989 --> 01:27:57.243
I might not get out. You keep it

01:28:03.409 --> 01:28:04.239
Let's go

01:28:24.377 --> 01:28:26.126
You'll never know who you are

01:28:43.793 --> 01:28:46.210
I might have an amnesia.
But I'm not stupid!

01:28:57.835 --> 01:28:59.586
Don't trust anyone! Remember?

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.295
Get your hands off me! Go get him!

01:29:15.253 --> 01:29:15.669
The disc!

01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:17.835
He's got the disc!

01:29:49.794 --> 01:29:50.707
You've got two choices

01:29:50.998 --> 01:29:53.459
Give us the disc, and jump off

01:29:53.665 --> 01:29:55.582
Or no. 2, we take the disc

01:29:55.793 --> 01:29:56.790
and throw you off

01:29:57.419 --> 01:29:58.543
I like the third choice

01:29:59.099 --> 01:30:02.140
I keep the disc
and I throw you both off!

01:30:02.847 --> 01:30:04.013
Good!

01:30:08.473 --> 01:30:09.097
How long?

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:10.097
30 seconds

01:31:04.468 --> 01:31:06.136
29 seconds. Not bad!

01:31:14.389 --> 01:31:15.010
Go and again

01:32:27.771 --> 01:32:28.316
Behind you!

01:32:58.353 --> 01:33:01.645
Take it easy, we've got plenty of time

01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:02.895
20 seconds

01:33:04.062 --> 01:33:04.603
Come on

01:34:19.615 --> 01:34:20.034
Come on

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:24.031
Time's up!

01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:24.910
Shut up!

01:34:52.325 --> 01:34:53.077
Game's over!

01:34:53.326 --> 01:34:54.449
Let's finish him!

01:36:43.883 --> 01:36:45.636
What are you fighting for?
Where is the disc?

01:36:45.903 --> 01:36:47.334
It fell at the carpark!

01:36:48.785 --> 01:36:51.016
Finish up, quickly!

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:57.517
The black bag in the carpark,
pick it up

01:37:09.501 --> 01:37:10.378
You want more fight?

01:38:27.344 --> 01:38:29.388
Don't hit me!

01:38:58.633 --> 01:39:00.303
He's up there!

01:40:09.039 --> 01:40:10.519
Which side he's going off?

01:40:10.619 --> 01:40:12.149
I don't know

01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:14.187
You bunch of bums!

01:40:31.690 --> 01:40:33.938
I can't believe
you're still in one piece!

01:40:35.044 --> 01:40:37.853
You've got no choice, come on

01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:44.087
They gotta be kidding!

01:40:47.428 --> 01:40:48.964
We won't catch him in this!

01:40:49.153 --> 01:40:50.096
It's under control

01:40:50.398 --> 01:40:52.395
Execute Plan B

01:40:59.421 --> 01:41:00.899
That's Plan B?

01:41:01.104 --> 01:41:02.080
No! Plan A!

01:41:02.447 --> 01:41:03.398
What's plan B?

01:41:03.547 --> 01:41:04.811
You'll see!

01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:53.404
Go!

01:42:56.782 --> 01:42:58.139
Think you can trust me now?

01:42:58.323 --> 01:43:00.588
Sorry. You're just so young to be C.I.A.

01:43:00.997 --> 01:43:03.323
Young?
We've got people who are eighteen!

01:43:06.231 --> 01:43:08.409
What is this? I'm one of you!

01:43:08.497 --> 01:43:10.857
NS1 Special Ops!

01:43:10.947 --> 01:43:11.448
We know who you are

01:43:12.129 --> 01:43:14.023
Then you know I'm undercover!

01:43:14.114 --> 01:43:16.155
Yes. I know

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.836
You're a disgrace to the C.I.A.
Get him out of my sight!

01:43:32.735 --> 01:43:35.917
All units! Search for the disc

01:43:37.194 --> 01:43:38.459
Nice kick!

01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:42.334
Thank you.
We couldn't have done this without you

01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:43.750
Anybody would do it

01:43:43.833 --> 01:43:45.503
One thing I never forget
my father told me

01:43:45.627 --> 01:43:46.626
Always do the right thing

01:43:47.044 --> 01:43:48.336
and stop the people who don't

01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:51.162
I wish everyone taught
their children that

01:43:51.185 --> 01:43:52.295
And don't worry,

01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:55.260
our headquarters are sending through
the information about your identity

01:43:55.352 --> 01:43:56.334
Thank you

01:43:57.785 --> 01:44:00.585
One last thing. Have you got the disc?

01:44:03.583 --> 01:44:06.209
He also told me, respect nature

01:44:11.498 --> 01:44:12.749
I dropped it somewhere

01:44:13.042 --> 01:44:13.627
I know

01:44:14.457 --> 01:44:15.333
Where are you going?

01:44:15.334 --> 01:44:18.042
Africa
