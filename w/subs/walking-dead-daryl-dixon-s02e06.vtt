It's also relevant
to the episode

It was kind of hard
to play on that guitar on set

because it wasn't tuned,

to not be tuned

several full bodysuits,

01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:54.113
There's so many losses that she
had taken responsibility for.

01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:56.420
Zabel: Not
that Sophia's gone forever,

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:58.378
but this idea that she
only sees Sophia as a walker,

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:00.076
that walker, Sophia, leaves.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.860
You okay?

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:05.081
I think so.

01:08:05.255 --> 01:08:07.300
I like it in this season
with just the two of them.

01:08:07.474 --> 01:08:09.259
It's a full circle.

01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:11.652
Nicotero: It's
an effortless relationship,

01:08:11.783 --> 01:08:14.829
and you don't need a lot
of words to express

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.136
how they feel about each other.

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:19.138
And that's how close
those two characters are.

01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:20.966
McBride: It's just the two
of them now.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.750
They're not back
in the Commonwealth.

01:08:22.924 --> 01:08:24.665
They're still in Europe.

01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:26.319
What's on the other side
of the tunnel

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:29.582
and where are they gonna go
from here?

01:08:29.756 --> 01:08:31.107
Carol: Let's go home.
