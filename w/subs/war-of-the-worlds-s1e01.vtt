<i>When I think back to that day,
small details stick in my mind.</i>

00:22.360 --> 00:27.160
<i>Things I said.
The looks on people's faces.</i>

00:27.280 --> 00:30.200
<i>They wanted to wipe us
from the face of the Earth...</i>

00:30.320 --> 00:33.760
<i>but we kept asking ourselves,
"Why?"</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:37.240
<i>After all the centuries of
mindless cruelty</i>

00:37.360 --> 00:40.200
<i>maybe we shouldn't
have been surprised</i>

00:40.320 --> 00:43.040
<i>Are we really so different?</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:46.160
<i>There's evil inside of us all.</i>

00:52.560 --> 00:57.960
Yes Sophia, it's me again.
You don't answer your phone.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.840
Your friend says you don't go
to the meetings any more.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.440
I'm worried about you.

01:06.560 --> 01:14.360
I'm at the observatory tonight.
Please call me back.

03:57.640 --> 04:02.400
Every song in the World
at your fingertips.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.356
I can never decide what to play.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.210
<i>J'arrive jamais à choisir.</i>

04:09.235 --> 04:10.710
Choice paralysis.

04:10.735 --> 04:13.303
I have it when I go
to the hypermarket.

04:13.327 --> 04:15.564
There is a hundred
different options.

04:15.660 --> 04:18.140
I just want toothpaste.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.000
Have you seen this?

04:36.560 --> 04:38.120
What's the source?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.840
Ross 128.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.280
Can you check the frequency?

04:55.960 --> 04:58.920
153.26 Gigahertz.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.040
So high? That can't be right.

05:02.160 --> 05:06.200
- That's what it says.
- Can you sonify the signal?

05:21.560 --> 05:24.600
Could be a satellite.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.920
I check with the ESA.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.800
No registered satellite
in that band pass.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.600
Is there a pulsar there?

05:47.600 --> 05:52.280
No, there is no pulsar
at those coordinates.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.080
And the frequency is too high.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.680
What's that?

06:00.800 --> 06:04.760
The signal that Arecibo
picked up last year.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.000
You know,
the one from Ross 128 B.

06:11.960 --> 06:16.320
- It's the same.
- Yeah, but it's a lot stronger.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.400
So what are we saying?

06:21.880 --> 06:24.400
What is it?

06:24.520 --> 06:27.443
There's no naturally
occurring phenomenon

06:27.468 --> 06:30.104
that can produce
a signal like this.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.080
Not in that frequency.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.440
- Where would you put it on the Rio scale?
- I don't know.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.480
Six, maybe seven.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.760
Put out an ATEL.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.765
We need someone
else to verify it.

06:50.790 --> 06:53.412
Contact ALMA.
Ask them to take a look at it.

07:00.937 --> 07:03.468
- Hanes!
- Sorry.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.360
And?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.280
ALMA Confirms the signal.

08:10.305 --> 08:13.904
They're getting the same
readings. Flipping out.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.539
Phase it up again.

08:16.564 --> 08:20.424
Are you really sure
it cannot be a pulsar?

08:20.520 --> 08:24.000
I've already checked.
This is real.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.840
What if we're wrong,
and we'll look ridiculous.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.920
We're not wrong, Catherine.
Make the call.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.642
Hi, This is Catherine Durand

08:56.667 --> 09:00.328
from the Institute the Radio
Astronomy Millimétrique.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.200
I believe we have
detected evidence...

09:05.400 --> 09:08.520
of extraterrestrial life.

09:28.329 --> 09:29.224

09:29.320 --> 09:32.440
- College doesn't start 'till nine.
- I'm meeting some friends.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.771
Okay, take a banana.

09:33.796 --> 09:36.824
Eating a banana's your
answer to everything.

09:38.280 --> 09:42.120
- Looks sore.
- You hate it, don't you?

09:42.240 --> 09:45.240
- It's your arm.
- Are you going to tell Dad?

09:45.360 --> 09:48.800
Maybe we'll wait till he gets home.
Go meet your friends.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.600
- Why aren't you dressed for school?
- I said I'd call Dad.

10:06.400 --> 10:11.700
Hey buddy, how are you doing?
Is Mum okay? Yeah?

10:12.920 --> 10:14.766
Yeah, no no,
I can't talk to her now.

10:14.791 --> 10:17.884
Because I'm just checking in,
but tell her I'll call her later, okay?

10:18.100 --> 10:20.982
Alright, okay, yeah,
cheers buddy, okay.

10:21.007 --> 10:23.044
Say hello to Em for me. Bye.

Hey. How are you doing?

10:27.034 --> 10:28.186
- Good.
- Good.

10:28.511 --> 10:30.148
Madeline Clairmont.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.240
<i>Increasing the amplitude of the
stimulation current</i>

10:35.360 --> 10:37.392
<i>results in the hyper-activation</i>

10:37.417 --> 10:40.824
<i>of the primary somatosensory
and pre-motor cortex.</i>

10:40.920 --> 10:45.691
This is direct evidence that an
induced current contributes most

10:45.716 --> 10:48.504
to corticospinal pathway excitation.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.080
So, actually...

10:51.200 --> 10:53.101
Raising the
stimulation amplitude

10:53.126 --> 10:55.617
would increase the
amounts of neurons firing

10:55.641 --> 11:00.280
and result in a larger response,
as we've just witnessed.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.600
Excuse me, am I boring you?

11:05.920 --> 11:08.422
Maybe we should fire a
few neurons into your brain

11:08.447 --> 11:10.204
just to get the juices flowing.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.636
We can make sense of this

11:14.661 --> 11:18.744
targeting of diverse neuronal
structures by two half segments.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.040
<i>The signal was detectable for
exactly 23 hours and 56 minutes.</i>

11:35.160 --> 11:38.480
<i>One sidereal day. One complete
rotation of the Earth.</i>

11:38.600 --> 11:43.000
<i>- Is there any significance in that?
- We don't know.</i>

11:43.680 --> 11:46.396
<i>You are part of the METI initiative.</i>

11:46.421 --> 11:49.984
<i>You've been sending
messages into space?</i>

11:50.080 --> 11:51.410
We send music.

11:51.435 --> 11:55.424
The idea is that music would
act as a universal language,

11:55.520 --> 11:58.280
but if they don't have ears
they won't be able to hear it,

11:58.400 --> 12:01.252
So, we encoded the entire
message in a binary system

12:01.277 --> 12:02.944
of two alternating frequencies

12:03.040 --> 12:05.840
pulsing 125 times per second.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.292
Could this be a response?

12:09.317 --> 12:12.224
If it is, it's in a language
that we don't understand.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.278
The electromagnetic
waves were...

12:14.303 --> 12:18.104
transmitted across a vast
distance with virtually no attenuation.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.960
What does that mean?

12:20.080 --> 12:23.056
It means that the power
source that generated the signal

12:23.081 --> 12:25.764
is greater than we
can even conceive.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.669
Does this mean
that they're a threat?

12:33.694 --> 12:35.824
There's no evidence
to suggest that.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.040
But surely it would be accrual
wrong to assume they aren't a threat.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.480
Doctor Durand, what do we know?

12:47.480 --> 12:51.720
Two years ago we discovered
an exoplanet orbiting Ross 128.

12:51.840 --> 12:56.560
The planet is in a habitable zone,
and it may be able to support life.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.720
But that's all we know.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.320
Why are we detecting
this signal now?

13:05.040 --> 13:12.040
We can't say for sure.
Perhaps they were looking for us.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.480
Thank you. Perhaps you
can leave us for a minute.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.110
Doctor.

13:29.135 --> 13:32.944
I'm Colonel Mokrani.
I am your point of contact.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.440
Pleased to meet you.

13:35.560 --> 13:38.120

13:39.160 --> 13:41.720

15:58.560 --> 16:00.600
- Do I ever go skiing?
- Yes,

16:00.720 --> 16:03.880
Because you work in the mountains,
I'll mean.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.600

16:13.200 --> 16:15.600
- Is everything alright?
- Yes,

16:16.840 --> 16:18.280
Terrible, all this.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.489
My men have secured things.

16:35.514 --> 16:38.344
You can be rest assured
if there's any trouble.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.440
I will do.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.960
- Catherine, how did it go in Brussels?
- It was okay.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.960

17:11.160 --> 17:13.680
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hi.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.660
Are you heading off again?

17:19.685 --> 17:23.344
I'm going to be sleeping at the
office while this thing play out.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.056
So, what aren't they telling
us? Should we be concerned?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.864
Well there's nothing to
tell, they detected a signal.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.121
Well, when the government
tell you not to panic,

17:32.146 --> 17:34.704
that's when you gotta buy
a rifle and head for the hills.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.560
You'd shoot yourself in the foot.

17:37.680 --> 17:42.040
You'll be lying there hoping the evil
government comes and rescues you.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.378
You want me to open that?

17:46.403 --> 17:49.104
Oh, I can open a bottle of wine.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.680
- Have you spoken to your Mum?
- She's fine.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.533
Are you in tomorrow night?

17:54.558 --> 17:57.624
Jack said he'd drop by
with the rest of my stuff.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.360
What am I supposed to say to him?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.200
Well, try nice polite conversation.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.440
You don't want me to stick one on him
because he dumped you, do you?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.920
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

18:13.040 --> 18:15.760
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.853
You should come out

18:37.440 --> 18:39.410
Yes, she is. She is, but.

18:39.435 --> 18:42.664
Then come to Vegas.
It will be fun.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.733

18:46.758 --> 18:49.224
No, you know what, it's late.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.320
But you could invite
me back to your room

18:54.560 --> 18:57.600

18:58.560 --> 19:00.200

19:02.920 --> 19:05.760
- The bill please.
- Right away.

- No idea.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.160

21:49.280 --> 21:51.240
Impossible.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.200
- What?
- I can't.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.080
They are slowing down.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.680
Because they entered our atmosphere.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.480
Could it...

22:35.600 --> 22:37.960
be an attack?

22:54.480 --> 22:58.240

- No idea. What is that?

26:18.440 --> 26:23.200
<i>We're detecting a strong
electromagnetic field.</i>

26:25.960 --> 26:31.080
<i>Alpha Team!
We've lost visual.</i>

26:31.200 --> 26:33.760
<i>It is some kind of metallic object.</i>

26:38.280 --> 26:42.760
<i>Alpha Team! Can you identify?
Alpha Team! Come in.</i>

26:42.880 --> 26:46.297
<i>I say, it's partially...
It's buried in the ground.</i>

26:46.321 --> 26:50.240
<i>A spherical, non-porous,
metallic object.</i>

26:50.360 --> 26:52.880
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

26:53.800 --> 26:55.600
<i>Alpha Team, come in!</i>

26:57.120 --> 27:00.080
<i>I repeat-radioactivity levels normal.</i>

27:00.200 --> 27:02.903
<i>Negative chemical
and biological agents.</i>

27:02.928 --> 27:04.904
<i>Strong electromagnetic field.</i>

27:05.000 --> 27:06.760
<i>Object...</i>

27:07.680 --> 27:12.120
<i>Metallic, spherical, non-porous.
Partially buried.</i>

27:13.440 --> 27:16.040
Pick up, damn it.

27:20.560 --> 27:23.160
Sophia.
Why do you keep calling me?

27:24.760 --> 27:27.688
We don't get along
well with each other but...

27:27.713 --> 27:30.164
please come to the observatory.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.720
- Why?
- It's safer.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.680
- Are those things dangerous then?
- I do not know.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.200
Please come here.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.120
Trust me now.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.680
What is going on?

27:47.800 --> 27:49.596
Do you still have
petrol in your tank?

27:49.621 --> 27:51.984
<i>Yes. What's going on.</i>

27:52.080 --> 27:55.124
Leave everything
behind and come here.

27:55.149 --> 27:57.644
Why? You are scaring me.

27:58.520 --> 28:03.140
<i>- Sophia, I beg you.</i>
- Okay.

28:37.560 --> 28:38.893
People are getting
out of London,

28:38.918 --> 28:41.464
so maybe I should go to my Dad's
until we know what's happening.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.107
Yeah, you should. You should go.

28:43.132 --> 28:44.824
The Channel Tunnel
is still open.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.663
So I'm gonna see
if I can get a train.

28:46.688 --> 28:49.624
And I'm going to meet you at
Dad's as soon as I can, okay?

28:50.900 --> 28:52.970
Sarah?

28:52.995 --> 28:56.628
<i>- Just be careful.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.440
- Bill?
<i>- Uh, hi Helen.</i>

29:10.560 --> 29:14.640
I just wanted to check
and see if you're okay.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.360
<i>These things last night -
God, it's insane.</i>

29:23.480 --> 29:26.880
Bill, one of the Neighbors said you were
hanging around the apartment last night.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.964
Jeez, I was just passing by.

29:30.989 --> 29:34.424
<i>Was it this crazy old
bitch with the shitty dog?</i>

29:34.520 --> 29:35.632
She never liked me.

29:35.657 --> 29:38.584
You know it's her dog
that craps in the hallway.

29:38.680 --> 29:42.240
It is not appropriate for
you to just show up here.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.524
What is it you want?

29:43.549 --> 29:46.224
What do you think's
going to happen with us?

29:46.320 --> 29:48.120
<i>I don't know?</i>

29:49.440 --> 29:51.280
I'm sorry.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.480
Him again?

29:58.086 --> 30:02.520
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- He's just worried.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.800
It's not his job to worry about you.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.240
<i>The most significant
discovery so far</i>

30:17.265 --> 30:19.424
<i>was from
astrophysicists in Brazil.</i>

30:19.520 --> 30:23.210
<i>They were the first to observe
concentrated electromagnetic activity</i>

30:23.235 --> 30:24.464
<i>in local sources.</i>

30:24.560 --> 30:26.200
<i>Several sources have now confirmed...</i>

30:26.320 --> 30:29.880
There are already four unknown substances
that have been found.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.040
What causes
the electromagnetic field?

30:34.160 --> 30:38.920
We only know the frequency and
vibration width are constantly increasing.

30:39.040 --> 30:43.760
We also send space probes to
other planets. It is possible...

30:43.880 --> 30:46.320
that they are here to do research.

30:46.440 --> 30:52.200
Why would they send so many?
And why only inhabited areas?

30:55.280 --> 31:02.080
Since the first signal.
It took exactly one day.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.160
Yeah, so?
They must have made a scan.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.960
Have they mapped the Earth?

31:10.520 --> 31:13.360
Do we have to destroy them?

31:14.440 --> 31:18.760
- They could be weapons.
- Check the pictures of Wyoming.

31:20.320 --> 31:27.080
Look. An F-16 has bombed one.
It sustained not even one scratch.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.080
My parents absolutely
want me to be with them.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.800
So, I'll stay if you want me to,
of course, but...

31:44.920 --> 31:47.554
You should go.

31:49.179 --> 31:51.624
Okay. Bye.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
<i>Expert analysis indicates the probes
are emitting an electromagnetic field.</i>

32:00.120 --> 32:02.120
<i>Though little is
understood of its purpose.</i>

32:02.240 --> 32:04.037
<i>Scientists around the
World are caught up</i>

32:04.062 --> 32:05.944
<i>in a fervent debate
as to the implications,</i>

32:06.040 --> 32:08.073
<i>but no conclusive answers
have been found thus far.</i>

32:08.098 --> 32:12.064
<i>There is still widespread speculation
as to the cause of the dropout in power...</i>

32:13.320 --> 32:15.520
Hey Tony, it's Bill.

32:15.640 --> 32:20.680
Listen Tony, I need the results of your
subretinal stimulation study.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.280
<i>That should be on the shared drive.</i>

32:23.400 --> 32:27.400
On the shared hard drive?
Okay thanks, I'll talk to you later.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.280
<i>- Dan, you gotta talk to the minister.</i>
- Dad. Dad, slow down.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.787
<i>No, you gotta listen to me Dan.</i>

33:01.812 --> 33:04.247
<i>The electromagnetic fields
these probes are emitting</i>

33:04.272 --> 33:07.304
<i>I think it's designed to interfere
with our neural functioning.</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:10.808
<i>They're identical to the pulses we
use to stimulate neurons in the brain.</i>

33:10.833 --> 33:13.504
It's the exact same frequency
and amplitude everything.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.836
<i>It's almost like they
understand our neurology.</i>

33:15.861 --> 33:18.504
- How is that even possible?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

33:18.529 --> 33:21.694
<i>But as the pulse gets stronger it's going
to cause more and more neurons to fire</i>

33:21.719 --> 33:24.960
<i>it'll cause seizures and our
bodies will shut down completely.</i>

33:24.985 --> 33:27.190
- Are you sure?
<i>- As sure as I can be.</i>

33:27.215 --> 33:30.576
People need to get somewhere completely
encased in metal, or deep underground.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.640
<i>Dan, you have to get the government
to issue a warning.</i>

33:33.760 --> 33:37.000
Okay, I'll speak to the minister.

33:59.560 --> 34:02.522
He's says that we'll start to fit, and
that our bodies will completely shut down.

34:02.546 --> 34:04.476
Yes, our scientists
are saying the same thing.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.786
They've been running
tests at Wortendale.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.159
What? You knew?

34:09.080 --> 34:10.505
Then, we need to issue an alert.

34:10.530 --> 34:12.583
We can't issue a
warning until we're sure.

34:12.608 --> 34:13.848
We can't risk mass panic.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.402
What if it's too late.

34:15.428 --> 34:18.864
Dan, the decision's been made.
Okay? We wait.

34:42.440 --> 34:45.760
Taxi.

34:51.639 --> 34:52.775
To the station please.

34:52.801 --> 34:54.583
No, no mister.
I'm not in service.

34:54.679 --> 34:56.032
Please, come on,
I really have to get to the...

34:56.056 --> 34:57.056
Get out of my taxi.

34:57.080 --> 35:01.087
Look,
just take this please. Just go.

35:01.112 --> 35:02.904
Okay, thank you.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.880
They're turning people around.

35:19.720 --> 35:24.040
- Then what do we do?
- Maybe we should just go home.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.347
I thought you said
it wasn't safe there.

35:26.372 --> 35:28.504
I'm not sure we've
got much choice.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.760
Things might calm down later.
We can try again.

35:33.880 --> 35:37.880
Text dad. Let him
know we're going home.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.400
What is that?

35:50.800 --> 35:53.640
Can you feel something?

35:54.640 --> 35:57.960
That's the sound.
I heard it last night.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.120
- Can't you hear it?
- No.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.400
It's so weird.

36:56.080 --> 36:59.400
Excuse me. Excuse me sir.
is there another route we can take, or?

37:02.600 --> 37:05.640
Okay, this is all I got.
Just get me there.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.560
- What the fuck is that?
- What is it?

37:44.480 --> 37:46.280
What is that?

37:46.400 --> 37:50.960
The electromagnetic fields
affect the atmosphere.

37:52.120 --> 37:55.960
Colonel, the British government
warns of an attack.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.004
They're saying there's
going to be an attack.

38:21.029 --> 38:22.844
- Who?
- It's the government's Twitter feed.

38:23.040 --> 38:26.880
They're telling people to find
shelter. To get underground.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.760
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.760
- Mum...
- I don't know.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.720
Why are they shooting at people?

38:36.880 --> 38:40.071
I'm sure they're just firing into the air.
They're warning shots.

38:40.096 --> 38:42.164
Your voice changes when you lie.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.494
<i>Hello with me. Where are you?</i>

39:16.519 --> 39:19.984
I'm stuck in traffic
on the mountain pass.

39:20.080 --> 39:24.280
Listen. We're being attacked.
You must seek cover.

39:24.400 --> 39:29.400
- Attacked?
- Just search for underground coverage.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.800
- Hurry up.
- I can't go anywhere.

39:59.040 --> 40:02.040
- Bill, what are you doing here?
- I've got to find Helen.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.410
No, she doesn't want to see you.
You know that.

40:04.435 --> 40:06.544
You don't understand.
There's an attack.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.790
You've gotta calm down.

40:07.815 --> 40:09.864
It's happening.
We don't have time.

40:24.680 --> 40:27.080
Mum. What should we do?

40:28.360 --> 40:30.480
- Mum.
- Do something!

40:45.040 --> 40:47.000
Slow down.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.200
What was that?

41:01.320 --> 41:03.600
Why are you going so quickly?

41:10.080 --> 41:13.240
Get out, get out!
Get into the station!

41:16.160 --> 41:18.160
Helen, open up!

41:24.440 --> 41:26.280
Helen, open up!

41:26.400 --> 41:28.893
- What are you doing here?
- You've gotta come with me right now.

41:28.917 --> 41:30.622
Come with me right
now or you're gonna die.

41:30.647 --> 41:32.250
- Come with you where?
- To the elevator.

41:32.275 --> 41:34.544
It'll protect us against
the electromagnetic field.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.559
- Have you seen Chris?
- No I haven't.

41:36.584 --> 41:37.984
Get in the elevator now.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.456
- We have to find Chris first.
- We don't have time.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.361
What are you doing?
Bill! Don't! Stop it! Chris!

41:43.060 --> 41:44.875
- You've gotta come with me.
- Chris! Chris!

41:46.100 --> 41:47.988
Chris! Chris!

42:04.640 --> 42:08.240
- Sorry to ruin everything.
- That is not true.

42:08.360 --> 42:14.600
- Yes. And you always help me.
- Make sure you go underground.

42:14.720 --> 42:19.560
- I have said so much to you.
- Go underground. Right now.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.920
I would not know where to go.

42:21.960 --> 42:22.960
Colonel.

42:24.085 --> 42:27.084
We have lost contact with
our planes. They've crashed.

42:31.380 --> 42:34.087
- Something is happening.
- Hello?

42:34.112 --> 42:36.684
Sophia? Sophia?

42:39.700 --> 42:40.736
Hello?

42:43.061 --> 42:44.315
Colonel.

42:45.116 --> 42:46.424
What is happening?

42:50.240 --> 42:53.160
We lost the network.
Restore the connection..

43:25.840 --> 43:26.978
How long till we get there?

43:27.003 --> 43:29.024
We have to find a way
to get out of the bay area.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.360
Watch out.

45:08.480 --> 45:11.520
Keep all doors closed.

45:11.640 --> 45:14.320
- Is it over?
- That is yet to be seen.

45:14.440 --> 45:18.680
People, flash lights out.
Let's save the batteries.
