00:41.041 --> 00:46.296
People might laugh
and say it's just a fairy tale.

00:46.505 --> 00:50.968
That these mysterious things
couldn't really happen.

01:28.714 --> 01:33.969
But this is the true story of my mother.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.057
The man that mother loved...

01:39.266 --> 01:41.518
Was a wolf man.

02:05.959 --> 02:11.340
Mother was a student at
a university just outside of Tokyo.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.758
Her tuition was paid for with
scholarships... this is what socrates said:

02:13.759 --> 02:15.885
- -And she worked a part-time job to cover living expenses.
- -This is what socrates said:

02:15.886 --> 02:19.446
- -And she worked a part-time job to cover living expenses.
- -In the textbook, it says...

02:20.932 --> 02:28.774
“The wise men of the world
may have great knowledge of many things...

02:28.982 --> 02:33.070
But goodness, truth, beauty, and arete... “

02:34.154 --> 02:35.530
one day in early summer,

02:35.739 --> 02:38.742
mother saw father for the
first time at the university.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.537
Wearing a shirt with a stretched-out
collar, using no textbook...

02:42.746 --> 02:45.874
Mother said he was completely
different from the other students

02:46.083 --> 02:49.836
as she watched him
from behind earnestly taking notes.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.567
Please wait.

03:17.114 --> 03:21.868
This is the attendance sheet. If you
don't turn it in, you'll be marked absent.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.414
Not a student here.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.622
What?

03:26.707 --> 03:29.835
If that bothers you, I won't come anymore.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.958
Please, wait!

04:12.043 --> 04:14.713
I don't care if you are a student or not,

04:14.921 --> 04:19.676
but the lecture can be hard
to understand without a textbook.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.304
Do you want to share mine?

04:31.396 --> 04:35.107
“Hokushin dry cleaners“

04:35.193 --> 04:39.112
it will be ready on Friday.
Thank you very much.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.031
Thank you for waiting.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.840
I'll put this here, then.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.342
I'll take this.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.854
Here, thank you.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.858
The accusers in this case
were the poet meletus,

05:58.066 --> 06:03.947
the politically powerful anytus,
and the sophist lycon.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.032
Meletus acted as their representative,

06:06.241 --> 06:09.744
but anytus is said to have
pulled the strings from behind.

06:32.183 --> 06:36.813
What do you think is fun?
What kind of food do you like?

06:37.022 --> 06:41.276
What were the people you loved
in the past like?

06:42.277 --> 06:44.779
Why are you called “Hana"?

06:44.988 --> 06:45.988
My name?

06:46.156 --> 06:47.782
Yeah.

06:47.991 --> 06:52.078
When I was born,
cosmos were blooming in the garden.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.540
They hadn't been planted by anyone,
but grew there naturally.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.752
My dad said that looking at them
made him think of my name.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.714
He wanted me to be a child
who always smiled, like the flowers.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.799
Even when things got hard,

07:05.008 --> 07:07.802
to just keep smiling,
even if the smile became forced.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.890
Because then I could
overcome most things, he said.

07:15.185 --> 07:19.689
That's why during dad's funeral,
I was smiling the whole time.

07:19.898 --> 07:25.654
But then, my relatives said that was
improper, and they were very angry with me.

07:27.739 --> 07:32.118
But... I suppose
it really was improper, wasn't it?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.079
It wasn't improper.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.959
I'm glad.

07:44.714 --> 07:51.054
“Hokushin dry cleaners“

08:00.772 --> 08:02.857
“Hakujuji“

08:05.694 --> 08:09.906
even in the same housing complex,
each room is completely different inside.

08:10.115 --> 08:16.997
Families with money, poor families,
big families, people living alone,

08:17.205 --> 08:21.584
families with babies,
elderly living alone...

08:31.928 --> 08:34.806
I bet it'd be nice to have my own house.

08:35.015 --> 08:42.022
To say, “I'm home“ and take off my shoes,
wash my face and hands, and sink into a chair.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.857
That'd be nice.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.442
I'd build a bookcase.

08:45.650 --> 08:49.446
And once that bookcase was full of books,
I'd build a new bookcase.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.866
I'd be able to do whatever I wanted
because it'd be my own house.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.499
Then, I'll say “welcome
home, “ if you want.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.762
Hana.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.847
What is it?

09:16.056 --> 09:19.350
There's something I have to tell you.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.227
You can tell me anything.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.937
Actually...

09:32.697 --> 09:34.365
I'll tell you tomorrow.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.076
Okay.

09:44.375 --> 09:50.715
“Hokushin dry cleaners“

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
“Hakujuji“

10:04.145 --> 10:08.441
“hakujuji“
“Christmas cakes“ “western sweets & coffee“

10:19.619 --> 10:25.333
“Hakujuji“

10:32.841 --> 10:37.262
“Hakujuji“

10:40.640 --> 10:42.016
Hana.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.813
I'm sorry, Hana.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.358
I'm sorry.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.868
I've never told anyone before.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.412
I was scared.

11:02.620 --> 11:08.626
I was afraid you'd leave if I told you,
but I should have told you sooner.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.045
I should have shown you.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.338
Shown me?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.966
Close your eyes for a second.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.640
For longer than that.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.983
Can I open them yet?

12:01.179 --> 12:02.555
Hana,

12:04.098 --> 12:07.101
what do I look like to you?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.733
She found out that
transforming during the full moon

12:13.942 --> 12:18.404
and attacking people was just a legend.

12:18.613 --> 12:25.912
“The world is full of things
I don't know, “ mother thought.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.416
Were you surprised?

12:30.625 --> 12:32.252
Will you leave me now?

12:33.795 --> 12:35.421
But you're shaking.

12:35.630 --> 12:36.881
Are you afraid?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.675
I'm not afraid.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.428
Because it's you.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.568
Father was a descendant
of the honshuu wolf,

12:57.777 --> 13:00.738
which had become extinct
about a hundred years ago.

13:00.947 --> 13:05.994
With both wolf and human blood,
he was the last of his kind.

13:06.911 --> 13:12.750
When father was a child, his parents told him
about the history of his extinct ancestors.

13:12.959 --> 13:17.338
They told him not to reveal the truth
to anyone, and then died.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.758
After that, he was taken in
by relatives who knew nothing of this

13:20.967 --> 13:24.137
and had a hard time
as he grew into an adult.

13:24.345 --> 13:29.267
After getting his driver's license,
he went to the city to look for work.

13:29.475 --> 13:37.475
Unknown and unheeded by men, father
said that he had lived in hiding until now.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.207
"Natural birth: Kind to your body and soul“

15:40.231 --> 15:46.779
“hakujuji“

17:30.758 --> 17:35.137
Mother gave birth to me
in that small apartment.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.014
It was snowing.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.476
Not at the hospital,
without even a midwife,

17:40.685 --> 17:42.979
my parents delivered me by themselves.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.232
Mother was worried that
if I had been born as a wolf,

17:46.440 --> 17:51.153
the doctors would have been surprised.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.953
I'm glad she was born safely.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.623
This is just the beginning.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.834
Do you think she will be a kind child?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.420
She might be a smart kid.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.839
I wonder what kind of adult she will be?

18:10.047 --> 18:13.175
A nurse, a teacher, or a baker...

18:13.384 --> 18:15.678
Whatever it is, I want her
to have a job she loves.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.765
I want her to have a happy,
healthy life free of troubles.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.644
Let's watch over her until she grows up.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.396
Yeah.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.874
My little brother was born
in the spring of the next year.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.959
It was raining that day.

18:48.336 --> 18:52.423
Suddenly, father was nowhere to be seen.

19:39.053 --> 19:44.141
I don't know what father
was thinking that day.

19:44.350 --> 19:48.646
Maybe he instinctively went
to hunt for food for his new baby.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.065
Maybe he wanted
something nutritious for mother,

19:51.273 --> 19:53.609
who was recovering from the birth.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.940
"Driver's license“

21:56.482 --> 22:03.823
“I'm leaving the kids to you, “
mother thought she could hear him say.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.664
Leave them to me.
I'll make sure to raise them properly.

22:23.008 --> 22:28.347
Mother had a lot of trouble with us after
that, but I don't remember anything about it.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.348
Num nums.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.934
Wait a minute, yuki. I'm making it now.

22:32.142 --> 22:32.768
Num nums!

22:32.977 --> 22:33.977
I said, it's almost done.

22:34.061 --> 22:34.728
Num nums!

22:34.937 --> 22:36.188
Yuki!

22:38.023 --> 22:39.692
When I was angry or upset,

22:39.900 --> 22:43.070
my fur would bristle,
and I would turn into a wolf.

22:43.279 --> 22:47.199
Oh all right, you can have a biscuit first.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.082
Apparently, I was always hungry,

22:55.291 --> 22:59.920
crying for food from morning until night.

23:00.129 --> 23:03.465
Completely different from
my sickly brother, ame, who ate little.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.929
Mother had to quit school
and leave her part-time job

23:09.138 --> 23:11.223
in order to take care of us.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.019
That was close...

23:15.227 --> 23:20.065
We lived on the small savings
father had left behind.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.744
That was close...

23:31.952 --> 23:36.332
According to mother, my brother
and I seemed like we weren't sure

23:36.540 --> 23:41.378
if we were supposed to be humans or wolves.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.927
“Pediatric care“

23:50.095 --> 23:51.972
they got me...

23:54.224 --> 23:54.767
“Child care encyclopedia“

23:55.060 --> 23:58.145
since she couldn't ask
those around her for advice,

23:58.354 --> 24:01.315
she had no choice but to study on her own.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.194
Breastfeeding every
two hours, day and night.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.780
When ame wouldn't suck on his own,

24:07.988 --> 24:10.468
she learned to feed him
with cotton pads dipped in breast milk.

24:11.117 --> 24:15.621
“Living with wolves“

24:22.336 --> 24:25.464
But when he wouldn't
drink any milk or stop crying,

24:25.673 --> 24:27.383
she didn't know what to do

24:27.591 --> 24:30.761
except pat him on the back
and comfort him the whole night.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.725
As a result, mother was
quickly becoming exhausted.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.943
I'm okay.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.231
Thanks to this, even if it
was just for a short time,

24:48.362 --> 24:51.031
she could fall asleep at a moment's notice.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.910
Mommy?

24:55.119 --> 24:56.370
What is it?

24:59.540 --> 25:02.710
What really caused problems
was when we got sick.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.294
Yu ki?

25:05.963 --> 25:07.464
Yu ki?

25:07.673 --> 25:09.174
Yu ki...!

25:19.101 --> 25:23.313
The pediatrician or the veterinarian...
She didn't know which one to take us to.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.775
My daughter swallowed
some desiccant by mistake...

25:26.984 --> 25:28.027
She's two years old.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.530
Yes, she threw up.
There was no blood.

25:31.739 --> 25:36.952
It says “silica gel“ on it.
Um, is it dangerous...?

25:37.161 --> 25:39.121
What? Her appetite?

25:40.247 --> 25:42.207
I'm hungry!

25:43.167 --> 25:46.462
Is that so? She's okay?

25:46.670 --> 25:52.718
She regretted not asking father
about how he was raised as a child.

25:52.926 --> 25:53.677
I wanna go for a walk.

25:53.886 --> 25:54.678
Yuki, that's...

25:54.887 --> 25:55.887
Walk!

25:55.971 --> 25:58.974
You were sick just a
little while ago. So...

25:59.183 --> 25:59.892
Walk!

26:00.100 --> 26:04.313
Okay, okay.
Now, put your ears away.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.901
Okay, let's go for a walk!

26:10.194 --> 26:13.739
I said, put your ears away!

26:14.782 --> 26:15.908
Okay!

26:36.345 --> 26:38.138
Hello. Aw, how cute.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.891
He said you're cute. Isn't that nice?

26:45.270 --> 26:46.438
Oh, sorry!

26:46.647 --> 26:47.981
It's okay.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.908
But that wasn't the only problem.

27:04.498 --> 27:07.459
What time do you think it is?!
Shut him up!

27:08.919 --> 27:09.628
I'm very sorry.

27:09.837 --> 27:12.756
You keep making such
a racket night after night!

27:12.965 --> 27:14.633
I'm really very sorry.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.552
At least discipline your kids properly...!

27:20.222 --> 27:23.350
Shh... it's okay.

27:42.578 --> 27:46.915
The contract said pets
are not allowed here, didn't it?

27:47.124 --> 27:48.124
I don't have any pets.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.670
Don't lie to me.
I know what's going on.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.839
If you think you can do whatever you want,

27:54.047 --> 27:57.384
then I'll have no choice
but to have you go elsewhere.

28:00.804 --> 28:01.972
You're caseworkers?

28:02.181 --> 28:06.435
Yes, we have some serious
misgivings about your children.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.228
What do you mean?

28:08.437 --> 28:13.901
Our records show that they've
never had regular checkups or vaccines.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.612
It's all right. They're healthy.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.616
If that's the case, can
we at least see them?

28:20.824 --> 28:21.867
No, that's...

28:22.075 --> 28:23.075
Just a look will do.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.330
We just want to see if
what you're saying is true or not.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.873
You're not welcome...

28:28.081 --> 28:32.002
If you don't let us in, you could
be suspected of abuse or neglect!

28:32.211 --> 28:33.879
Please, leave!

29:14.795 --> 29:16.380
Hey...

29:16.588 --> 29:18.173
What is it, mommy?

29:18.382 --> 29:20.842
What do you want to do from now on?

29:21.051 --> 29:23.971
Do you want to be human, or wolf?

29:24.179 --> 29:25.681
Huh?

29:27.808 --> 29:29.810
I'm thinking of moving.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.772
So that you can choose
whichever one you want.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.815
Ever since the town hall
started presenting unoccupied houses,

29:55.877 --> 29:58.880
people who want to live
in the country have been coming steadily,

29:59.089 --> 30:01.133
but they never last long.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.719
As you can see, there's nothing here.

30:03.927 --> 30:06.698
The elementary school and hospital
are both thirty minutes away by car.

30:06.722 --> 30:10.100
The junior high is two and a half hours
by bus and train, one way.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.685
That's five hours round trip!

30:11.893 --> 30:15.480
No matter how much you want to raise
your children in a good environment...

30:17.232 --> 30:19.943
The town is a lot more convenient,
in my opinion.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.126
Wow...

30:36.335 --> 30:38.170
It's so big...

30:38.378 --> 30:41.006
And I know the rent is practically free,

30:41.214 --> 30:43.675
but you know, the cost of repairs
is nothing to laugh at.

30:43.884 --> 30:47.971
Instead of calling it an unoccupied
house... oh, you can keep your shoes on...

30:48.180 --> 30:51.475
It's more like an abandoned house.

30:51.683 --> 30:56.146
But at least there's electricity,
and the mountain stream isn't dried out,

30:56.355 --> 30:58.207
and they said you could use
whatever is in the shed.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.900
That's a field, isn't it?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.819
Oh, this place isn't really suitable
for growing your own food.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.947
Animals come down from the mountains
and damage the crops.

31:06.156 --> 31:09.076
Even if you make the effort
to grow vegetables, they'll all get eaten.

31:09.284 --> 31:13.372
This place is full of unoccupied houses
because the humans are getting kicked out.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.165
Then, the neighbors are...?

31:15.374 --> 31:21.713
Neighbors? There isn't anyone around for
miles. Shall we look at a different place?

31:21.922 --> 31:23.691
There might be a better
place near the village...

31:23.715 --> 31:24.424
I've decided.

31:24.633 --> 31:25.633
What?

31:25.675 --> 31:27.386
I've decided on this place.

31:29.096 --> 31:29.763
Why?

31:29.971 --> 31:32.015
Wow! What is this place?

31:32.224 --> 31:33.725
Our new home.

31:44.111 --> 31:44.736
Oopsie Daisy!

31:44.945 --> 31:46.905
It's slanted!

31:50.450 --> 31:52.494
Oh, hello Mr. Ant!

31:54.371 --> 31:56.665
Wow, what's this?!

32:02.504 --> 32:04.464
Stomp! Stomp!

32:15.142 --> 32:17.144
How is it? Do you like it?

32:17.352 --> 32:19.104
I like it!

32:19.312 --> 32:21.565
I want to go home.

32:27.863 --> 32:31.199
She said she wanted a place
with no neighbors close by.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.743
She was a little different,
if you know what I mean.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.661
What about her husband?

32:34.870 --> 32:35.412
I don't know...

32:35.620 --> 32:36.620
Her income?

32:36.705 --> 32:37.289
I'm not sure...

32:37.497 --> 32:39.958
Then how does she expect
to take care of her kids?

32:40.167 --> 32:46.089
Oh, grandpa nirasaki!
We'll be in your care from now on.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.976
Look, look! Mommy, look!

33:40.185 --> 33:41.478
Tada...!

33:46.358 --> 33:48.652
Come here, birdie...

33:48.860 --> 33:50.779
C'mon, come here...

34:14.636 --> 34:16.805
“Yuki - age 5“ “ame - age 4“

34:53.967 --> 34:55.343
Thank you very much.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.053
Thank you.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.393
Good evening.

35:03.727 --> 35:04.978
Good evening.

35:06.479 --> 35:10.317
Hey, wait, is that her?

35:16.740 --> 35:17.907
Let's go...

35:31.880 --> 35:33.506
Splash!

35:34.841 --> 35:37.010
I guess we'll have to be
more frugal from now on.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.762
Frugal?

35:38.970 --> 35:43.141
I was just thinking that we should at least
be able to grow our own vegetables.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.186
I'll help!

35:47.979 --> 35:48.979
Wait here, okay?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.440
Okay.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.859
“Home garden“

35:55.070 --> 35:55.737
these please.

35:55.945 --> 35:56.945
Okay.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.238
These, too.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.032
“The wolf is coming“

35:59.407 --> 36:00.407
oh, yuki!

36:00.700 --> 36:01.700
“The wolf is coming“

36:02.410 --> 36:06.748
it's our little secret that
you two are wolf children.

36:06.956 --> 36:07.956
Right.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.961
If you were to suddenly become wolves,
everyone would be very surprised.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.256
So you cannot become wolves
in front of other people.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.716
Promise?

36:16.925 --> 36:18.259
Promise!

36:18.468 --> 36:20.053
And one more thing.

36:20.261 --> 36:23.890
If you meet other animals in the mountains,
you can't act like you are better than them.

36:24.099 --> 36:25.266
Why not?

36:25.475 --> 36:27.769
Because daddy will feel sad about it.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.437
Okay?

36:29.646 --> 36:31.147
Okay!

36:31.564 --> 36:33.584
Iiiwe'll never forgive you! I the angry
villagers chased after the wolf with guns."

36:33.608 --> 36:36.608
"'I'm sorry! I won't do it again, '
the boastful wolf cried as he ran away."

37:02.554 --> 37:04.347
Oh no!

37:04.556 --> 37:05.556
Why?

37:05.682 --> 37:07.642
I don't know. I wonder what happened...

37:11.062 --> 37:13.064
Hello? Excuse me!

37:13.273 --> 37:14.399
What?

37:14.607 --> 37:17.652
Is it okay if I take
the fallen leaves from the woods?

37:17.861 --> 37:19.404
What did you say?

37:19.612 --> 37:21.030
The fallen leaves!

37:21.239 --> 37:24.743
No one would ask
for permission to take that stuff!

37:24.951 --> 37:26.870
Thank you very much!

37:29.122 --> 37:30.540
I wonder how long she'll last.

37:30.749 --> 37:34.669
She'll start talking about convenience
stores and karaoke soon enough.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.087
You got that right.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.895
I'll get it right this time...

37:52.103 --> 37:53.688
Mom... my...

37:53.897 --> 37:55.273
What?

37:55.482 --> 37:56.065
Ame!

37:56.274 --> 37:57.274
What happened?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.443
You calico cat!

37:58.651 --> 38:01.488
You're weak even though you're a wolf,
so they've got it in for you.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.536
They're just scratches.
Nothing to worry about.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.325
You won't be able to survive like that!

38:05.533 --> 38:06.159
Yuki.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.286
Do the “all better“ thing.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.996
All better, all better.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.624
I wouldn't lose to a wild boar!

38:12.832 --> 38:13.833
You saw a wild boar?

38:14.042 --> 38:18.171
Yup, and a monkey and a serow.
But I wasn't scared at all.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.673
It was fun when they ran away
when I chased them.

38:20.882 --> 38:21.341
And...

38:21.549 --> 38:22.549
Yuki.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.344
And then when I peed...

38:24.552 --> 38:25.720
Do you remember your promise?

38:25.929 --> 38:28.556
That you wouldn't act like
you were better than the other animals?

38:28.765 --> 38:29.349
But...

38:29.557 --> 38:30.934
Please.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.604
Fine.

38:36.064 --> 38:36.731
Thank you.

38:36.940 --> 38:40.693
Do the “all better“ thing again.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.154
All better, all better.

38:45.406 --> 38:52.288
But, how do wolf children
become adults, anyway?

38:54.749 --> 38:56.167
Yuki, wait!

38:56.376 --> 38:57.168
Piggyback.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.377
Already?

38:58.461 --> 39:00.672
You're too slow! Hurry up!

39:01.673 --> 39:05.927
“Wolves start learning to hunt
at around four months old.

39:06.135 --> 39:09.430
First, they learn what hunting is
with mice and other small animals.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.934
As they get older,
they form teams with adult wolves..."

39:13.142 --> 39:13.685
We're a team!

39:13.893 --> 39:15.019
No, we're not.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.938
Fine, be that way.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.734
Don't go too far!

39:21.943 --> 39:23.152
I know!

39:24.737 --> 39:26.072
Let's go home...

39:26.281 --> 39:32.245
Ame, I wonder if this
wild grass is edible... let's see...

39:47.594 --> 39:48.887
I got it!

39:55.476 --> 39:56.811
Got it!

40:02.650 --> 40:05.069
Oh, look at that, ame!

40:14.162 --> 40:16.080
All better, all better.

40:16.289 --> 40:20.293
Mommy, look at this! It's a cormorant!
There was a stream over there, and...

40:20.501 --> 40:22.837
Shh...

40:23.046 --> 40:24.046
Mommy...

40:25.465 --> 40:29.052
Why is the wolf always the bad guy?

40:29.260 --> 40:32.180
You mean, in the picture books?

40:32.388 --> 40:36.517
Everyone hates them,
and they're always killed in the end...

40:36.726 --> 40:40.855
If that's the case,
I don't want to be a wolf.

40:43.483 --> 40:49.447
You're right. But you know,
mommy likes wolves.

40:49.656 --> 40:55.453
Even if everyone else hates the wolf,
I'll take the wolf's side.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.798
Mommy! Mommy!

41:07.465 --> 41:08.257
What's wrong?

41:08.466 --> 41:09.467
They wilted again.

41:09.676 --> 41:10.843
What?

41:15.473 --> 41:19.477
Diseased... all of them? Don't tell me...

41:19.686 --> 41:21.688
Mommy...

41:21.896 --> 41:25.149
What's going to happen to us now?

41:29.028 --> 41:32.657
Mommy's no good like this.
I've got to learn more!

41:32.865 --> 41:34.826
Will you help me again?

41:35.785 --> 41:36.953
Sure.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.746
Thanks.

41:41.916 --> 41:42.709
Go inside.

41:42.917 --> 41:43.960
Okay.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.421
Hello!

41:46.629 --> 41:50.633
I was going to visit earlier,
but it got so busy around here...

41:50.842 --> 41:53.636
It's hard to grow your own food, isn't it?

41:53.845 --> 41:57.140
Even when I do what it says in the book,
I keep messing up.

41:57.348 --> 42:01.394
But this is a nice place, isn't it?
With nature all around us.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.146
Nature, ha!

42:03.354 --> 42:06.274
Plants don't grow overnight, you know.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.275
Huh?

42:07.483 --> 42:10.111
At this rate, it'll be the same
no matter how many times you try.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.946
Isn't that what you think?

42:12.155 --> 42:14.032
T-That's...

42:14.240 --> 42:17.201
Don't smile! Why do you smile?

42:17.410 --> 42:20.121
Even if you smile,
you won't be able to do anything.

42:35.511 --> 42:38.014
That person's scary.

42:38.222 --> 42:42.477
No, it's mommy's fault
for not knowing anything.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.812
Even though you're an adult?

42:47.023 --> 42:50.735
I should have asked
your daddy about more things.

43:02.163 --> 43:03.915
It's raining cats and dogs!

43:04.123 --> 43:05.416
Hello...

43:06.918 --> 43:08.336
Here, this is for you.

43:08.544 --> 43:09.544
What are they?

43:09.629 --> 43:10.880
Seed potatoes.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.716
You mean the ones you plant in the fields?

43:14.592 --> 43:17.345
Is there anything else
you can do with them?

43:17.553 --> 43:21.349
Don't worry about what dad said.
That's just how he is.

43:21.557 --> 43:23.893
No, it was my fault.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.897
Hello!

43:29.148 --> 43:30.233
Sorry.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.026
Don't worry about it.

43:33.361 --> 43:34.779
Here.

43:40.576 --> 43:44.455
Grandpa nirasaki,
thank you for the seed potatoes.

43:44.664 --> 43:46.958
Ah, are you trying to let them go to waste?

43:53.840 --> 43:56.175
You have to start over from the soil.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.977
You won't get anything
done hoeing like that.

44:06.185 --> 44:08.354
I'm sorry...

44:17.822 --> 44:19.574
Um, what about the fertilizer...?

44:19.782 --> 44:21.622
Did you use leaves when
you prepared the soil?

44:21.701 --> 44:22.243
Yes.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.953
Then you don't need fertilizer.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.174
When you're done, clear this field, too.

44:36.382 --> 44:41.679
I don't need such a big field. I just
need to grow enough for my kids and me.

44:43.556 --> 44:45.474
Did you hear me?

44:48.311 --> 44:49.854
Yes...

45:10.833 --> 45:12.793
Make ridges in the soil.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.297
Okay.

45:18.299 --> 45:20.218
Leave more space in between.

45:20.426 --> 45:21.928
Okay.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.890
That's too low. Make them higher.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.516
Okay.

46:07.556 --> 46:14.355
In a week, plant them cut-side down.
Don't water them. Just leave them!

46:14.563 --> 46:19.193
Um, thank you for teaching me how to...

46:35.584 --> 46:37.920
Mommy, are you okay?

46:49.140 --> 46:50.224
Hello!

46:50.433 --> 46:51.434
Come with us.

46:51.642 --> 46:51.976
Huh?

46:52.184 --> 46:53.978
It's okay, just come.

46:54.186 --> 46:54.395
What?

46:54.603 --> 46:56.355
Come on, let's go.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.194
Hey...

47:02.403 --> 47:03.821
Yes?

47:04.030 --> 47:05.790
If you plant chamomile
and cabbage together,

47:05.948 --> 47:08.284
bugs won't attack
and the flavors will be better.

47:08.492 --> 47:11.412
No, you want celery with your cabbage.

47:11.620 --> 47:13.998
No, no, it's better for
novices to use this.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.207
No, no, no,

47:15.416 --> 47:17.960
you can't fill up a stomach on chamomile.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.713
You should plant them shallowly like this.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.716
No, you should water the hole
before you put anything in.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.927
No, no, you can water them later.
Plant them first.

47:27.136 --> 47:28.679
No, no, you're wrong.

47:28.888 --> 47:31.088
You should just sprinkle
the extra fertilizer like this.

47:31.265 --> 47:33.434
If you put too much,
it'll just bring more bugs.

47:33.642 --> 47:36.145
No, give me that. You have to pile it on.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.314
No, you only need a little.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.649
If you do what this guy says,
you'll definitely fail.

47:40.858 --> 47:41.525
That's you!

47:41.734 --> 47:42.318
What?!

47:42.526 --> 47:44.195
What did you say?!

47:45.488 --> 47:46.739
Wood vinegar?

47:46.947 --> 47:49.075
It's made from the smoke
when charcoal is produced.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.827
And poultry manure.
There are instructions inside.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.913
Thank you for coming all this way to help.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.121
No, no.

47:55.164 --> 47:57.666
Sorry about showing up
without warning like this.

47:57.875 --> 47:58.542
It's no problem.

47:58.751 --> 48:01.188
It's hard working the land
if you're not used to it, isn't it?

48:01.212 --> 48:04.006
I still have a lot I have to learn.

48:04.215 --> 48:06.109
There are a lot of city folks
who get discouraged

48:06.133 --> 48:08.386
and leave right after moving here.

48:08.594 --> 48:09.929
Other young people...?

48:10.137 --> 48:15.684
Oh no, these were retired old men. It
was hilarious how weak they were mentally.

48:18.354 --> 48:23.150
I don't know if it means anything if I say it,
but this isn't an easy place to live off the land.

48:23.359 --> 48:24.777
The drainage isn't very good.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.487
And we get a lot of snow.

48:26.695 --> 48:29.156
We have to help each other.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.953
We thought you didn't want
anything to do with the neighbors.

48:34.161 --> 48:38.582
There are only a few young mothers around,
so it's nice to have someone else around.

48:38.791 --> 48:40.185
Let us know if you have any questions.

48:40.209 --> 48:42.211
Then“.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.630
What? You're living off your savings?

48:44.839 --> 48:46.632
But I need to start working soon.

48:46.841 --> 48:49.635
It's hard to find work around here.

48:49.844 --> 48:53.472
Everyone leaves their kids
at the preschool and commutes to work.

48:53.681 --> 48:55.808
Right?

48:56.016 --> 48:57.810
What's a preschool?

48:58.018 --> 48:58.394
What?

48:58.602 --> 49:00.354
Why don't ame and I go?

49:00.563 --> 49:03.190
- -Well, that's because...
- -I want to go to preschool, too!

49:03.941 --> 49:04.941
Iwanna go!

49:05.067 --> 49:10.698
I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go...!

49:10.906 --> 49:11.906
Iwanna go!

49:12.074 --> 49:15.870
I wanna go to the preschool...!

49:16.078 --> 49:17.997
Yuki, hurry up and finish your food.

49:18.205 --> 49:20.833
I know it's supposed to be a secret...

49:21.041 --> 49:23.210
But I can stay human.

49:23.419 --> 49:24.962
But you know...

49:25.171 --> 49:27.590
I can do it...

49:35.598 --> 49:37.641
Y-Yuki...!

49:37.850 --> 49:39.935
Hana, did you get a dog?

49:40.144 --> 49:42.438
Um, yeah...

49:43.147 --> 49:44.899
Isn't that a wolf?

49:45.107 --> 49:47.776
- -What? N-No, that's...
- -Isn't it, dear?

49:47.985 --> 49:48.985
Don't be stupid!

49:49.028 --> 49:53.115
There are no wolves in Japan anymore.
That's a Shepherd mixed with something else.

49:53.324 --> 49:56.035
Right, Hana? Am I right? Am I right?

49:56.243 --> 49:57.870
Oh? The dog's gone.

49:58.078 --> 49:59.997
Hello, Mrs. Nirasaki!

50:00.206 --> 50:02.875
Oh hello, yuki. Aren't you friendly today.

50:03.083 --> 50:05.753
Oh, you and the dog have matching clothes!

50:05.961 --> 50:08.214
That's cute.

50:08.422 --> 50:11.675
Yu... yuki...

50:15.763 --> 50:17.640
What's wrong, Hana?

50:39.161 --> 50:40.788
Hello?

50:42.289 --> 50:43.958
Hello!

50:50.130 --> 50:53.092
I wonder where grandpa nirasaki is...

50:53.300 --> 50:55.219
Oh, these grew nicely.

50:55.427 --> 50:56.655
It was thanks to everyone's help.

50:56.679 --> 50:59.557
Ours were destroyed,
so this'll really help.

50:59.765 --> 51:00.933
Destroyed? By what?

51:01.141 --> 51:02.142
By a wild boar.

51:02.351 --> 51:03.477
Here, take this.

51:03.686 --> 51:05.020
This much...?

51:05.229 --> 51:06.397
The boar, that bastard...

51:06.605 --> 51:08.941
Oh, thank you for bringing this.

51:09.149 --> 51:12.486
It came and dug everything up
without making a sound.

51:12.695 --> 51:15.698
It came all the way down
to sakai's fields this year.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.158
Here, take this in return.
Watch out, it's heavy.

51:18.367 --> 51:21.745
The only fields with
no animal damage are yours, Hana.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.224
It's strange, even though
you're so deep in the mountains.

51:24.248 --> 51:25.791
Do you have some kind of trick?

51:26.000 --> 51:27.251
No, I don't...

51:27.459 --> 51:29.253
Everyone wants to know how you did it.

51:29.461 --> 51:30.796
What's a trick?

51:31.005 --> 51:32.172
I need to pee!

51:32.381 --> 51:35.009
Yuki's a lively child, isn't she?

51:35.926 --> 51:36.927
Could it be...?

51:37.136 --> 51:38.262
What is it?

51:38.470 --> 51:40.889
Oh, no, never mind.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.309
Wow, thank you very much.

51:43.517 --> 51:44.018
Don't mention it.

51:44.226 --> 51:45.436
Thanks for the potatoes.

51:45.644 --> 51:47.084
It's been a while since we had eggs.

51:47.146 --> 51:48.397
I'm glad to help.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.441
Let me know when you run out!

51:50.649 --> 51:53.694
Oh my, isn't that cute!

51:55.362 --> 51:56.363
What?

51:56.572 --> 51:57.323
Ready, lift.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.658
Oh, you don't have to give us
something so big...

51:59.867 --> 52:01.535
Don't worry about it.

52:01.744 --> 52:03.454
It was just sitting in the storage shed.

52:03.662 --> 52:04.788
But...

52:04.997 --> 52:08.584
Please take it. If we bring it
back, gramps'll get mad at us.

52:08.792 --> 52:10.002
Grandpa nirasaki?

52:10.210 --> 52:12.421
He's always talking about you, Hana.

52:12.630 --> 52:13.690
Because he's fallen for her.

52:13.714 --> 52:15.382
Come on, he's already ninety.

52:15.591 --> 52:18.636
But he even told everyone
to help her and everything.

52:18.844 --> 52:21.430
Idiot! He said not to say anything
about that, remember?!

52:22.640 --> 52:24.933
So that's what it was...?

52:38.864 --> 52:43.869
I finally understand
why I needed a bigger field.

52:48.666 --> 52:49.917
I don't like it.

52:50.125 --> 52:51.168
What?

52:51.377 --> 52:54.338
Why are you always smiling and laughing?

52:58.759 --> 53:00.260
Don't laugh.

53:03.681 --> 53:06.058
What's so funny?

53:15.442 --> 53:20.322
We moved here trying
to get away from prying eyes...

53:20.531 --> 53:24.284
When did we end up in the care
of the people from the village?

53:26.286 --> 53:32.209
It was hard at first,
but I think we'll do fine here.

53:41.093 --> 53:43.053
Wow, look at that!

56:47.070 --> 56:48.822
M-Mommy...!

56:49.031 --> 56:50.782
Mommy...! Mom...

56:50.991 --> 56:51.408
Ame!

56:51.617 --> 56:53.619
Mom! Ame's fallen...!

56:54.620 --> 56:56.914
Mommy! Mommy...!

56:59.041 --> 57:00.250
Ame!

57:01.543 --> 57:04.254
Ame! Ame!

57:05.756 --> 57:07.132
Ame...!

57:07.841 --> 57:09.635
Mom... my...

57:09.843 --> 57:11.219
Ame!

57:11.845 --> 57:14.306
Mom... my...

57:27.903 --> 57:30.447
Ame... ame!

57:31.156 --> 57:32.824
A-Ame!

57:33.033 --> 57:35.369
Open your eyes! Ame!

57:35.577 --> 57:37.079
Open your eyes!

57:37.287 --> 57:41.583
Ame, ame, ame...

57:41.792 --> 57:46.588
Open your eyes...

57:47.673 --> 57:50.092
Mommy... that's... too tight...

57:50.300 --> 57:51.760
Ame!!

57:51.969 --> 57:53.428
You know what?

57:53.637 --> 57:56.348
I found a crested kingfisher.

57:56.556 --> 58:03.313
It was a really nice-looking bird.
I felt like even I could catch it today.

58:03.522 --> 58:07.401
It was completely different
from how it usually feels.

58:07.609 --> 58:12.531
I wasn't scared. Suddenly,
I felt like I could do anything.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.658
So then, I...

58:16.702 --> 58:18.620
Why are you crying?

58:19.746 --> 58:22.457
What are we doing here?

58:27.671 --> 58:32.551
Mother said later that she had
never been more frightened in her life.

58:33.719 --> 58:39.307
After that incident, ame seemed
like a completely different person.

58:42.185 --> 58:43.865
“Yuki - age 6“ “ame -
age 5“ “yuki - age 5“

58:46.523 --> 58:48.203
“yuki - age 6“ “ame -
age 5“ “yuki - age 5“

58:51.153 --> 58:52.833
“yuki - age 6“ “ame -
age 5“ “yuki - age 5“

58:56.116 --> 58:56.324
“yuki - age 6“ “ame -
age 5“ “yuki - age 5“

58:56.492 --> 58:59.953
it was worth it because
she finally agreed to let me go.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.162
Howeve r...

59:01.288 --> 59:02.539
No matter what happens...

59:02.748 --> 59:05.959
I won't turn into a wolf. I know already!

59:06.168 --> 59:06.710
Don't forget your promise!

59:06.918 --> 59:08.003
I'll be fine!

59:08.211 --> 59:10.505
Then remember,
“piggy promise, promise kept.“

59:10.714 --> 59:12.090
what's that?

59:12.299 --> 59:14.139
It's a charm to keep you
from becoming a wolf.

59:14.176 --> 59:15.343
A charm?

59:15.552 --> 59:18.555
Piggy promise, promise kept. J'

59:18.764 --> 59:19.764
that's how you do it.

59:19.931 --> 59:20.931
Piggy...

59:21.016 --> 59:23.935
Promise, promise kept.

59:24.144 --> 59:27.731
Piggy promise, promise kept! J'

59:31.902 --> 59:35.030
Piggy promise, promise kept! J'

59:36.823 --> 59:39.868
Piggy promise, promise kept. J'

59:40.077 --> 59:41.328
hurry up!

59:41.536 --> 59:44.831
Piggy promise, promise kept. J'

59:45.040 --> 59:48.543
Piggy promise, promise kept. J'

59:48.752 --> 59:52.506
Piggy promise, promise kept. J'

59:59.429 --> 1:00:01.723
It was the first time in my life

1:00:01.932 --> 1:00:04.726
that I had ever been surrounded
by so many people.

1:00:04.935 --> 1:00:06.935
- -Don't push me!
- -I had wanted to go so badly...

1:00:07.062 --> 1:00:09.502
- -Stop pushing me!
- -...But when it finally came down to it,

1:00:09.689 --> 1:00:13.318
I wasn't sure if I would be okay or not.

1:00:14.736 --> 1:00:16.822
But that was just at the beginning.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:21.827
Daddy, I'm off!

1:00:22.035 --> 1:00:23.829
I'm 90 mg n o w!

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:25.997
Okay, be careful.

1:00:26.206 --> 1:00:27.332
I will!

1:00:32.087 --> 1:00:33.630
Imorning, shino!

1:00:33.839 --> 1:00:34.839
Good morning, yuki!

1:00:35.006 --> 1:00:36.258
I saved you a seat!

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:37.551
Thanks!

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:41.263

- -I do!
- -I do! I do! I do! I do! I do!

1:00:46.184 --> 1:00:48.395
No running in the halls!

1:00:48.603 --> 1:00:54.401
- -You can do it!
- -Go, yuki!

1:00:54.609 --> 1:00:56.403
Wow, yuki!

1:00:56.611 --> 1:00:59.531
- -You're so fast!
- -You're amazing!

“nature conservationist assistant wanted“

1:01:14.421 --> 1:01:16.464
“hometown nature“

1:01:22.387 --> 1:01:24.514
Thank you for waiting. Shall we go?

1:01:24.723 --> 1:01:27.225
My name is tendo, and I
am a nature conservationist.

1:01:27.434 --> 1:01:29.895
Welcome to niikawa nature sanctuary.

1:01:30.103 --> 1:01:32.772
I look forward to working with you.

1:01:32.981 --> 1:01:37.444
A nature conservationist's job
is not just to protect nature.

1:01:37.652 --> 1:01:41.239
Environmental education, field surveys,
the conservation of plants and animals...

1:01:41.448 --> 1:01:45.827
These three pillars of conservancy are
made possible by the support of volunteers.

1:01:46.036 --> 1:01:49.414
We do many different types of work,
so while we are specialists,

1:01:49.623 --> 1:01:52.459
we also need to be able to do
a little of everything.

1:01:52.667 --> 1:01:59.758
So, we are looking for someone who can help
the conservationist with all the work, but...

1:01:59.966 --> 1:02:05.889
Honestly speaking, we can't pay very much.
We can pay enough to cover training expenses

1:02:06.097 --> 1:02:08.017
for someone studying
to become a conservationist,

1:02:08.225 --> 1:02:10.435
but we can't afford much more than that.

1:02:10.644 --> 1:02:14.022
A high schooler's part-time job
pays a lot more per hour.

1:02:14.231 --> 1:02:16.024
Even knowing all that...

1:02:16.233 --> 1:02:18.068
Do you still want to do it?

1:02:19.486 --> 1:02:23.615
Um... I heard that you have a wolf here...

1:02:27.285 --> 1:02:29.162
This is our timber wolf.

1:02:29.371 --> 1:02:30.789
He's very quiet.

1:02:30.997 --> 1:02:32.499
He's not that young anymore.

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:35.418
Excuse me, director...?

1:02:35.627 --> 1:02:37.254
Excuse me for a moment.

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:48.890
Nice to meet you. I came
because I have something to ask you.

1:02:49.099 --> 1:02:50.892
He's a wolf's child.

1:02:51.101 --> 1:02:52.978
His father, the wolf, died.

1:02:53.186 --> 1:02:57.065
I'm his mother,
but I don't know how to raise a wolf.

1:02:57.274 --> 1:03:00.819
How did you learn the ways of the wolf?

1:03:03.446 --> 1:03:07.701
Will you tell us how
you were raised in the forest?

1:03:20.130 --> 1:03:21.464
Sorry about that.

1:03:23.425 --> 1:03:27.053
A wealthy person got
special permission to keep him as a pet,

1:03:27.262 --> 1:03:30.473
but when the owner died there was no one
to take him, so he came to live with us.

1:03:30.682 --> 1:03:33.768
Apparently, he was born in the Moscow zoo.

1:03:33.977 --> 1:03:35.770
So he isn't from the wild?

1:03:35.979 --> 1:03:38.815
I think it's rare to see
wild wolves in zoos.

1:03:39.024 --> 1:03:42.444
If they're bred, the babies
are sent out to be fostered.

1:03:42.652 --> 1:03:47.324
There are also wild birds and raccoon dogs
who are brought here when they get hurt.

1:03:47.532 --> 1:03:49.868
After we treat them...

1:03:52.704 --> 1:03:54.831
I'm going to start coming here from now on.

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:57.375
Ame, you'll be okay coming with me, right?

1:03:59.169 --> 1:04:02.005
I'll learn about
the mountains and nature as I work,

1:04:02.213 --> 1:04:06.051
and teach you the things I learn.

1:04:06.259 --> 1:04:08.219
It was my first time seeing a real one.

1:04:08.428 --> 1:04:09.721
A wolf?

1:04:09.929 --> 1:04:11.723
Was daddy like that, too?

1:04:11.931 --> 1:04:13.725
No, not at all.

1:04:13.933 --> 1:04:14.933
I'm glad.

1:04:14.976 --> 1:04:16.394
Why?

1:04:16.603 --> 1:04:20.148
Because he seemed kind of sad, somehow.

1:04:22.484 --> 1:04:25.695
I wanted to meet daddy.

1:04:27.739 --> 1:04:31.826
Mommy wants to see him again, too.

1:04:32.035 --> 1:04:37.374
As mother settled into her new job,
I was undergoing a huge shock.

1:04:37.582 --> 1:04:38.917
Bunko, yours is so nice!

1:04:39.125 --> 1:04:40.543
Keno, yours is pretty, too!

1:04:40.752 --> 1:04:42.545
I found a four-leaf clover!

1:04:42.754 --> 1:04:43.754
Me, too!

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:46.508
Yuki, did you find anything?

1:04:46.716 --> 1:04:48.510
Yeah, look!

1:04:50.387 --> 1:04:56.184
I found out that no other girls
played with rat snakes for fun.

1:04:56.393 --> 1:04:58.603
Look, these used to be my mom's.

1:04:58.812 --> 1:05:00.105
They're so pretty.

1:05:00.313 --> 1:05:02.816
My parents bought this for me
for my last birthday.

1:05:03.024 --> 1:05:04.484
Lucky!

1:05:04.692 --> 1:05:06.486
Yuki, show us your treasure box, too!

1:05:06.694 --> 1:05:07.362
Okay!

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:08.822
Ooh, what's inside?

1:05:09.030 --> 1:05:10.240
Look!

1:05:12.158 --> 1:05:20.083
I was also the only girl who collected
small animal bones and dried reptiles.

1:05:20.291 --> 1:05:23.962
The moment I realized
that other girls didn't do those things,

1:05:24.170 --> 1:05:26.297
I was so embarrassed.

1:05:26.506 --> 1:05:28.007
Hurry up!

1:05:28.216 --> 1:05:30.343
That was when I decided.

1:05:30.552 --> 1:05:34.722
From then on, I was going to act
more graceful and ladylike.

1:05:38.977 --> 1:05:41.646
Don't laugh! I'm seriously
worrying about this!

1:05:41.855 --> 1:05:44.774
Why don't you just do what you want, yuki?

1:05:44.983 --> 1:05:47.360
I don't want people looking at me funny!

1:05:47.569 --> 1:05:49.195
I guess it can't be helped.

1:05:49.404 --> 1:05:50.697
Huh?

1:05:56.202 --> 1:06:02.500
When mother made a new dress for me,
I remember being really happy.

1:06:02.709 --> 1:06:03.334
Good morning.

1:06:03.543 --> 1:06:06.087
Thanks to the dress,
I was able to fit in with my class

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:08.965
- -and get along with my friends.
- -Good morning!

1:06:09.174 --> 1:06:10.174
Good morning!

1:06:10.341 --> 1:06:12.260
Oh, yuki, your dress is so cute!

1:06:12.469 --> 1:06:13.553
It's wonderful!

1:06:13.761 --> 1:06:15.304
- -Lucky!
- -Heaven only knows how much that dress helped me.

1:06:15.305 --> 1:06:16.097
- -Let's go!
- -Heaven only knows how much that dress helped me.

1:06:16.098 --> 1:06:18.075
- -Okay!
- -Heaven only knows how much that dress helped me.

1:06:18.099 --> 1:06:19.099
The next year,

1:06:19.267 --> 1:06:21.811
it was hard to get ame to school.

1:06:22.020 --> 1:06:26.107
Get it? It's “piggy promise, promise kept."

1:06:27.942 --> 1:06:29.652
School's this way!

1:06:38.203 --> 1:06:42.832
“Happy first day of school!“
“1st grade“

1:06:43.666 --> 1:06:49.088
“let's get along!“ "2nd grade“

1:06:50.089 --> 1:06:55.512
“full of energy!“ “1st grade“

1:06:58.681 --> 1:07:06.681
“let's be friends!“ “2nd grade“

1:07:18.034 --> 1:07:22.622
“Please and thank you“
“3rd grade“

1:07:23.790 --> 1:07:28.670
“let's fly together!“
“4th grade“

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:35.176
“let's figure it out!“
“3rd grade“

1:07:44.852 --> 1:07:45.895
Good morning.

1:07:46.104 --> 1:07:48.439
Oh, ame, is it a school holiday?

1:07:49.274 --> 1:07:50.024
So you're skipping?

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:51.317
Yeah.

1:07:52.777 --> 1:07:54.696
You can come here anytime.

1:07:54.904 --> 1:07:57.574
Sorry for always bringing him here.

1:07:57.782 --> 1:07:59.385
- -Yes, this is the observation pond.
- -Ah, you're going bird-watching.

1:07:59.409 --> 1:08:03.246
- -You can see frogs that still have their tails.
- -One moment, please. You'll find it...

1:08:03.454 --> 1:08:05.516
- -Hana, can you help me for a sec?
- -...Over there on your right.

1:08:05.540 --> 1:08:06.540
Coming!

1:08:20.346 --> 1:08:21.889
Attention, everyone!

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:25.602
Let me introduce a transfer student.
This is sohei fujii.

1:08:25.810 --> 1:08:27.353
Why don't you greet everyone?

1:08:27.562 --> 1:08:29.564
I'm sohei. Nice to meet you.

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:31.733
Nice to meet you!

1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:36.779
Hey, do you have dogs at your house?

1:08:36.988 --> 1:08:38.573
Huh? Why?

1:08:38.781 --> 1:08:41.492
You smell kind of like animals.

1:08:43.453 --> 1:08:44.453
We don't have any dogs.

1:08:44.495 --> 1:08:48.833
Really? That's weird.
I totally thought you had dogs.

1:08:49.250 --> 1:08:50.335
What is it?

1:08:50.543 --> 1:08:52.462
Huh? Oh, the smell...

1:08:52.670 --> 1:08:54.213
Smell? What smell?

1:08:54.422 --> 1:08:57.008
Maybe it's just my imagination...

1:09:08.603 --> 1:09:10.271
Which one should I pick...?

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:11.648
I'll go with this one!

1:09:11.856 --> 1:09:14.067
Aw man, seriously?

1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:16.986
Oh, yuki!

1:09:17.195 --> 1:09:19.864
Yuki, you should come
join us. Sohei's funny.

1:09:20.823 --> 1:09:23.034
Oh, I have to return this book.

1:09:24.702 --> 1:09:26.496
What's up with her?

1:09:26.704 --> 1:09:29.123
She's not usually like that...

1:09:29.832 --> 1:09:31.542
Hey, yuki, you know...

1:09:31.751 --> 1:09:33.419
Oh, yuki...

1:09:33.628 --> 1:09:35.588
You know what?

1:09:35.797 --> 1:09:37.006
Hey, yu ki!

1:09:37.215 --> 1:09:38.216
Yu ki...

1:09:38.424 --> 1:09:39.801
C'mon, yuki...

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:43.638
Tell me the truth!

1:09:46.182 --> 1:09:46.933
About what?

1:09:47.141 --> 1:09:49.435
Did I do something to you?

1:09:49.644 --> 1:09:50.937
You didn't do anything.

1:09:51.145 --> 1:09:53.189
Do you dislike me
because I'm a transfer student?

1:09:53.398 --> 1:09:54.190
That's it, isn't it?

1:09:54.399 --> 1:09:55.441
I said, it's nothing.

1:09:55.650 --> 1:09:56.901
Then why are you avoiding me?

1:09:57.110 --> 1:09:58.569
I'm not avoiding you!

1:09:58.778 --> 1:10:00.571
Piggy promise, promise kept.

1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:02.573
Piggy promise, promise kept.

1:10:02.782 --> 1:10:03.991
- "Piggy...
- -Hey!

1:10:05.368 --> 1:10:06.368
Wait!

1:10:06.494 --> 1:10:07.912
Piggy promise, promise kept.

1:10:08.121 --> 1:10:09.664
Piggy promise, promise kept.

1:10:09.872 --> 1:10:11.207
Piggy promise, promise kept.

1:10:11.416 --> 1:10:13.167
Piggy promise, promise kept.

1:10:24.637 --> 1:10:26.222
Stop following me!

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:29.100
Don't come any closer!

1:10:29.308 --> 1:10:30.518
What are you doing?

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:32.311
Don't touch me!

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:34.647
Yuki! Yuki!

1:10:47.785 --> 1:10:48.785
“Tsururindo“

1:10:51.122 --> 1:10:52.122
“tsururindo“

1:10:52.790 --> 1:10:53.999
“tsururindo“

1:10:55.626 --> 1:10:56.626
“tsururindo“

1:11:08.055 --> 1:11:10.433
Sorry to bother you during work.

1:11:12.727 --> 1:11:15.062
Do you know how much
his head was bleeding?

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:16.647
It was my ear.

1:11:16.856 --> 1:11:18.149
Yuki.

1:11:18.357 --> 1:11:20.902
She wouldn't talk no matter
what we asked her...

1:11:24.655 --> 1:11:26.949
Were you really the one who hurt him?

1:11:29.619 --> 1:11:31.245
Did you apologize?

1:11:35.124 --> 1:11:36.334
Apologize.

1:11:37.502 --> 1:11:39.003
I said, apologize.

1:11:51.390 --> 1:11:52.892
I'm sorry.

1:11:54.644 --> 1:11:56.896
I'm very sorry for what my child has done.

1:11:57.104 --> 1:11:59.565
That's how it is, Mrs. Fujii.

1:11:59.774 --> 1:12:02.235
There is the school's insurance
for the medical bills, so...

1:12:02.443 --> 1:12:05.863
Do you really think this can be
taken care of with just an apology?!

1:12:07.448 --> 1:12:10.868
What were you planning to do
if he lost his hearing?

1:12:11.077 --> 1:12:13.639
Parents are responsible
for their children's actions, aren't they?

1:12:13.663 --> 1:12:16.541
Would you go into debt
or sell your house to compensate us?

1:12:16.749 --> 1:12:18.751
Now, now, this isn't the place to...

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:22.129
If you don't let me
hear what she's thinking, I'll...

1:12:22.338 --> 1:12:23.464
A wolf.

1:12:23.673 --> 1:12:24.924
What?

1:12:25.466 --> 1:12:27.510
It was a wolf that did it.

1:12:29.595 --> 1:12:31.013
A wolf did it.

1:12:31.222 --> 1:12:32.306
Sohei?

1:12:32.515 --> 1:12:34.308
What are you saying?

1:12:34.517 --> 1:12:36.018
Soheh

1:12:36.227 --> 1:12:37.854
sohei?

1:12:38.062 --> 1:12:39.622
Don't decide whose fault it is already!

1:12:39.772 --> 1:12:40.565
I know!

1:12:40.773 --> 1:12:42.108
She's been different lately...

1:12:42.316 --> 1:12:43.526
Stop it!

1:12:48.573 --> 1:12:50.324
That's what I thought.

1:12:58.583 --> 1:13:00.376
What happened to sohei?

1:13:00.585 --> 1:13:01.752
He left early.

1:13:01.961 --> 1:13:03.045
Why?

1:13:03.254 --> 1:13:04.297
Because he got hurt.

1:13:04.505 --> 1:13:06.173
How did he get hurt?

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:07.174
That's...

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:09.218
Who hurt him?

1:13:11.470 --> 1:13:11.721
Yuki!

1:13:11.929 --> 1:13:13.031
- -Yuki!
- -I thought it was her.

1:13:13.055 --> 1:13:14.515
- -Thought so.
- -What's wrong?

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:15.850
I'm like a detective...

1:13:16.058 --> 1:13:18.269
Quiet! Everyone, quiet down!

1:13:22.398 --> 1:13:24.108
It didn't work.

1:13:25.401 --> 1:13:28.613
No matter how many times I tried the charm.

1:13:30.823 --> 1:13:34.702
Will I be chased out of school?

1:13:35.578 --> 1:13:39.165
Will we have to leave our house?

1:13:41.584 --> 1:13:43.294
I'm sorry...

1:13:45.379 --> 1:13:49.133
I'm s o rryl

1:13:51.510 --> 1:13:55.097
m om, I'm sorry!

1:13:55.306 --> 1:13:57.475
All better, all better.

1:14:15.201 --> 1:14:17.161
“School bus“

1:14:39.475 --> 1:14:41.477
Sohei?

1:14:49.568 --> 1:14:52.071
Homework. From sohei.

1:15:11.048 --> 1:15:12.883
From sohei.

1:15:24.353 --> 1:15:25.980
Soheh

1:15:27.356 --> 1:15:31.193
she went to play at shino's house today.

1:15:31.402 --> 1:15:32.987
I see...

1:15:33.779 --> 1:15:35.781
Oh, wait a minute.

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:48.252
You came a long way, didn't you?

1:15:48.461 --> 1:15:50.671
Thank you for coming by every day.

1:15:52.339 --> 1:15:55.051
I don't want yuki to stop coming to school.

1:15:57.470 --> 1:16:02.308
You know, that day,
you said that a wolf did it, right?

1:16:02.516 --> 1:16:04.518
What did you mean by that?

1:16:04.727 --> 1:16:08.147
That was... I mean...

1:16:08.355 --> 1:16:13.652
You might not believe me, but that
day, I saw a wolf for a split second,

1:16:13.861 --> 1:16:19.325
and when I came to, I was bleeding.
So the wolf was the one who did it.

1:16:19.533 --> 1:16:21.952
I mean, it wasn't yuki's fault.

1:16:22.161 --> 1:16:26.207
I know other kids
are saying stupid things, but...

1:16:26.415 --> 1:16:28.125
I see.

1:16:29.168 --> 1:16:32.046
Can I ask you one more thing?

1:16:32.254 --> 1:16:34.256
Do you hate wolves?

1:16:37.802 --> 1:16:39.678
Not really.

1:16:41.013 --> 1:16:43.390
Me neither.

1:17:03.244 --> 1:17:06.038
Hey, you wanna see this?

1:17:06.247 --> 1:17:07.373
What?

1:17:12.253 --> 1:17:14.922
It's cool, isn't it? Wanna touch it?

1:17:15.131 --> 1:17:16.674
Here.

1:17:21.846 --> 1:17:23.055
Does it hurt?

1:17:23.264 --> 1:17:24.765
It itches.

1:17:28.811 --> 1:17:30.271
Let's go!

1:17:34.150 --> 1:17:35.860
I'm going now.

1:17:36.068 --> 1:17:37.486
Where are you going?

1:17:37.695 --> 1:17:38.815
I'm going to sensei's place.

1:17:38.863 --> 1:17:40.030
Who's sensei?

1:17:40.239 --> 1:17:42.825
Sensei... is sensei.

1:17:43.033 --> 1:17:45.411
I see. Will you be okay by yourself?

1:17:45.619 --> 1:17:46.704
Yeah.

1:17:46.912 --> 1:17:47.912
Be careful.

1:17:47.955 --> 1:17:48.955
Okay.

1:17:49.039 --> 1:17:50.374
Don't stay out too late.

1:17:50.583 --> 1:17:51.876
Okay.

1:17:55.796 --> 1:17:56.797
Where's yuki?

1:17:57.006 --> 1:17:58.507
She went back to school today.

1:17:58.716 --> 1:18:00.009
Oh, that's good.

1:18:00.217 --> 1:18:01.427
What about ame?

1:18:01.635 --> 1:18:03.512
He comes and goes, I guess.

1:18:03.721 --> 1:18:05.514
That's fine.

1:18:05.723 --> 1:18:06.783
There's something to be said

1:18:06.807 --> 1:18:09.810
for a guy who stops
going to school in elementary school.

1:18:10.019 --> 1:18:11.812
Edison and I were both like that.

1:18:12.021 --> 1:18:14.101
There you go, saying such
irresponsible things again!

1:18:14.190 --> 1:18:16.233
Speaking of which,
does anyone live on the mountain?

1:18:16.442 --> 1:18:16.859
On the mountain?

1:18:17.067 --> 1:18:19.361
Ame said he was going to sensei's place...

1:18:19.570 --> 1:18:21.770
I was sure he was talking
about grandpa nirasaki, but...

1:18:21.906 --> 1:18:23.699
I don't know about that...

1:18:23.908 --> 1:18:27.369
No one would go into the mountains
during the busy farming season.

1:18:28.204 --> 1:18:30.873
Sensei knows everything.

1:18:31.081 --> 1:18:32.875
He knows everything about the mountain.

1:18:33.083 --> 1:18:36.253
I didn't think you'd make friends
with someone older than you.

1:18:36.462 --> 1:18:40.382
Bring him over to our house sometime.
I want to thank him, and...

1:18:40.591 --> 1:18:42.384
Sensei doesn't meet with humans.

1:18:42.593 --> 1:18:45.193
He doesn't come down to the village
like the wild boars and bears.

1:18:47.348 --> 1:18:50.726
But it's probably okay if it's you, mom.

1:19:06.575 --> 1:19:10.412
Sensei is the master
of the entire mountain in these parts.

1:19:12.414 --> 1:19:15.459
Thank you for always taking care of ame.

1:21:48.445 --> 1:21:50.322
“Hometown nature“

1:21:59.123 --> 1:22:02.042
“Hometown nature“

1:22:05.379 --> 1:22:07.339
you can take a bath now.

1:22:07.548 --> 1:22:09.758
Yuki, you should have
sensei teach you, too.

1:22:09.967 --> 1:22:12.469
Your hunting will get a lot better.

1:22:12.678 --> 1:22:15.180
There's a trick to running
through the forest at full speed.

1:22:15.389 --> 1:22:18.225
And to reading the terrain, too.

1:22:18.434 --> 1:22:19.935
You'll learn a lot.

1:22:20.144 --> 1:22:22.187
How to find water and
how to read the weather,

1:22:22.396 --> 1:22:25.482
and marking your territory
and getting along with others...

1:22:25.691 --> 1:22:26.900
There's no way I'm going.

1:22:27.109 --> 1:22:27.693
Why not?

1:22:27.901 --> 1:22:30.154
What about you?
Why won't you come to school?

1:22:30.362 --> 1:22:32.364
Because the mountain's interesting.

1:22:32.573 --> 1:22:34.074
Because there's a lot I don't know.

1:22:34.283 --> 1:22:35.451
I don't need to know.

1:22:35.659 --> 1:22:36.243
Why not?

1:22:36.452 --> 1:22:38.620
Just come to school already.

1:22:40.205 --> 1:22:40.747
I don't want to.

1:22:40.956 --> 1:22:41.498
Why not?

1:22:41.707 --> 1:22:42.458
Because I'm a wolf.

1:22:42.666 --> 1:22:43.459
You're a human.

1:22:43.667 --> 1:22:44.918
I'm a wolf.

1:22:49.381 --> 1:22:51.758
I've already decided not to become a wolf.

1:22:51.967 --> 1:22:53.594
Why not?

1:22:53.802 --> 1:22:54.595
Hey, why not?

1:22:54.803 --> 1:22:57.639
Because I'm human! Do you hear me?!
Because I'm human!

1:22:57.848 --> 1:22:58.891
But why?

1:22:59.099 --> 1:23:00.642
Stop asking so many questions!

1:23:00.851 --> 1:23:03.187
You're a wolf, aren't you?
Why don't you act like one?

1:23:03.395 --> 1:23:05.522
Shut up! You don't know anything!

1:23:05.731 --> 1:23:06.940
About what?

1:23:07.232 --> 1:23:09.586
If you don't come to school tomorrow,
I'll never forgive you!

1:23:09.610 --> 1:23:10.277
I'm not going!

1:23:10.486 --> 1:23:11.528
I'll never forgive you!

1:23:11.737 --> 1:23:12.779
I'm not going!

1:23:19.369 --> 1:23:20.746
Wanna fight?

1:23:21.997 --> 1:23:24.541
What is it? What's that sound?

1:23:25.792 --> 1:23:27.669
Yuki! Ame!

1:23:33.675 --> 1:23:36.345
Stop it, both of you!

1:23:50.734 --> 1:23:53.070
Stop it, yuki! Ame!

1:24:11.463 --> 1:24:12.214
Yuki...

1:24:12.422 --> 1:24:13.840
Ame...?

1:24:21.723 --> 1:24:23.433
Ame...

1:24:50.711 --> 1:24:54.506
Yuki and ame are both
starting to walk their own paths.

1:24:56.425 --> 1:25:02.139
Even though that's what I wanted...
Why am I so uneasy?

1:25:04.725 --> 1:25:07.394
Why is that?

1:25:15.944 --> 1:25:21.617
My last summer in elementary school, there
were a number of record-breaking storms.

1:25:21.825 --> 1:25:26.246
Ame started to go
into the mountains all the time.

1:25:26.455 --> 1:25:31.627
He seemed to be very worried
about the effects of the heavy rains

1:25:31.835 --> 1:25:34.087
on sensei and the plants
and animals of the mountains.

1:26:01.114 --> 1:26:02.366
Ame!

1:26:04.493 --> 1:26:06.870
Where have you been all this time?

1:26:07.079 --> 1:26:09.998
You're cold. Hang on,
I'll get the bath ready.

1:26:10.207 --> 1:26:13.794
Sensei... hurt his leg, and he can't move.

1:26:14.002 --> 1:26:16.463
He'll probably die soon.

1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:24.721
Someone has to take over all the
things he has been doing on the mountain.

1:26:28.141 --> 1:26:29.434
Ame.

1:26:30.185 --> 1:26:32.688
You can't go into the mountains anymore.
Do you understand?

1:26:32.896 --> 1:26:35.399
You're only ten years
old. You're still a child!

1:26:35.607 --> 1:26:39.486
Even if a ten-year-old wolf is an adult,
you're still...

1:26:51.915 --> 1:26:53.667
Please.

1:26:53.875 --> 1:26:56.586
Please don't go into the mountains anymore.

1:26:56.795 --> 1:27:00.215
Please... for me.

1:27:03.468 --> 1:27:05.804
C'mon! Over here!

1:27:07.389 --> 1:27:10.767
Shoot it! Pass it!

1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:15.623
- -By the way, did you know?
- -Know what?

1:27:15.647 --> 1:27:16.647
“6th grade“

1:27:18.358 --> 1:27:18.567
“6th grade“

1:27:18.567 --> 1:27:19.234
and?

1:27:19.443 --> 1:27:20.986
They said sohei's mom...

1:27:21.194 --> 1:27:22.237
Is getting married!

1:27:22.446 --> 1:27:24.030
- -What?
- -No way!

1:27:24.239 --> 1:27:25.239
Why?

1:27:25.365 --> 1:27:26.551
Probably because she's beautiful.

1:27:26.575 --> 1:27:28.785
Then sohei will have a new dad?

1:27:28.994 --> 1:27:29.703
That's good.

1:27:29.911 --> 1:27:33.206
But sohei doesn't know about this yet.

1:27:33.415 --> 1:27:34.415
What?

1:27:34.583 --> 1:27:36.793
- -No way!
- -Really?

1:27:37.002 --> 1:27:39.963
You can't tell anyone about this!

1:27:41.047 --> 1:27:44.551
All right! Yes!

1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:47.012
How many points do we have now?

1:28:39.314 --> 1:28:40.357
Good morning.

1:28:40.565 --> 1:28:42.609
Today, it will be sunny during the day,

1:28:42.818 --> 1:28:46.154
but heavy rain will start
in the evening and continue overnight.

1:28:46.363 --> 1:28:49.008
- -It's so humid!
- -Please use caution if you go out during this time.

1:28:49.032 --> 1:28:51.326
First, the meteorological report.

1:28:51.535 --> 1:28:52.535
Yu ki...

1:29:05.924 --> 1:29:09.177
- -Take care!
- -In the northwest region, it will be sunny followed by rain,

1:29:09.386 --> 1:29:12.472
with lightning in some parts.

1:29:12.681 --> 1:29:15.892
The southwest region
will be sunny followed by rain.

1:29:16.101 --> 1:29:19.271
- -Ame?
- -The northeast region will be sunny with scattered showers.

1:29:19.479 --> 1:29:23.733
- -Ame!
- -The southeast region will be sunny with scattered showers.

1:29:23.942 --> 1:29:25.902
Don't forget your umbrellas
when you go out today.

1:29:30.907 --> 1:29:35.412
So the problem is asking, how far
can the swallow fly in three hours?

1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:39.082
First of all, do you know
what seventy km/h means?

1:29:39.291 --> 1:29:40.876
If you take seventy km,

1:29:41.084 --> 1:29:43.879
km/h means the number
of kilometers traveled per hour.

1:29:44.087 --> 1:29:48.592
So in one hour,
the swallow can fly seventy kilometers.

1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:51.219
The weather front along
the sea of Japan is moving south,

1:29:51.428 --> 1:29:54.723
and atmospheric conditions
have become extremely unstable.

1:29:54.931 --> 1:29:55.931
Because of this,

1:29:56.057 --> 1:30:00.395
there will be lightning and sudden gusts
accompanying the heavy rains.

1:30:00.604 --> 1:30:04.274
Predicted rainfall is,
depending on the location,

1:30:04.482 --> 1:30:07.861
over seventy mm per hour in the flat areas,
and near the mountains,

1:30:08.069 --> 1:30:10.322
over one hundred mm per hour.

1:30:10.530 --> 1:30:14.993
The weather station has issued
a heavy rain flood warning.

1:30:15.201 --> 1:30:19.915
Use extreme caution due to possible landslides,
rises in river level, submersion of buildings,

1:30:20.123 --> 1:30:22.667
as well as other damage.

1:30:23.710 --> 1:30:27.172
And now, for today's
eleven o'clock weather alerts.

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:32.135
In the northwest region,
heavy rain, lightning, and flood warnings.

1:30:46.524 --> 1:30:50.153
Have a seat, everyone. Sit down!

1:30:50.362 --> 1:30:52.989
It looks like there will be
severe rainstorms soon,

1:30:53.198 --> 1:30:55.241
so afternoon classes have been canceled.

1:30:55.450 --> 1:30:57.493
Yay!

1:30:57.786 --> 1:30:58.786
“6th grade“

1:31:02.916 --> 1:31:02.999
your parents are being contacted
to come pick you up.

1:31:03.208 --> 1:31:07.003
Until they come, gather in the gym
according to where you live.

1:31:27.565 --> 1:31:29.275
A blackout?

1:31:54.300 --> 1:31:55.301
I have to go.

1:32:04.102 --> 1:32:07.814
I understand. I'll head over now.

1:32:08.023 --> 1:32:11.818
Ame, let's go pick up yuki together.

1:32:12.027 --> 1:32:13.278
Ame?

1:32:17.657 --> 1:32:18.658
Ame?

1:32:18.867 --> 1:32:20.160
Where are you?

1:32:23.663 --> 1:32:24.873
Ame!

1:32:28.376 --> 1:32:29.544
Ame!

1:32:33.339 --> 1:32:34.591
Ame!

1:32:36.009 --> 1:32:37.302
Ame!

1:32:42.348 --> 1:32:44.601
Where are you, ame?!

1:32:44.809 --> 1:32:45.977
Ame!

1:33:10.460 --> 1:33:12.045
Takahiro?

1:33:12.796 --> 1:33:14.339
Mommy!

1:33:17.258 --> 1:33:19.052
Keiko!

1:33:19.260 --> 1:33:20.845
Daddy!

1:33:21.054 --> 1:33:24.766
Yankee doodle came to town... j'

1:33:30.271 --> 1:33:32.857
My parents sure are late.

1:33:33.066 --> 1:33:34.275
Don't worry.

1:33:34.484 --> 1:33:35.860
But...

1:33:36.069 --> 1:33:38.238
If we have to stay at the school overnight,

1:33:38.446 --> 1:33:39.864
we can play cards all night.

1:33:40.073 --> 1:33:41.073
Cards?

1:33:41.157 --> 1:33:42.283
I wanna play.

1:33:42.492 --> 1:33:43.868
Oh, that sounds like fun!

1:33:44.077 --> 1:33:45.370
It'll be like camp!

1:33:45.578 --> 1:33:46.972
I'll go get the cards from the classroom.

1:33:46.996 --> 1:33:48.123
Okay.

1:33:48.331 --> 1:33:50.125
Do you even know how to play cards?

1:33:50.333 --> 1:33:51.918
I only know how to play old maid.

1:33:52.127 --> 1:33:53.127
Stupid!

1:33:53.211 --> 1:33:55.088
Don't fight, you two.

1:33:56.673 --> 1:33:58.216
Shino!

1:33:58.424 --> 1:33:59.717
Oh, dad!

1:33:59.926 --> 1:34:01.344
You're so late.

1:34:01.553 --> 1:34:06.933
Sorry, sorry. It's a raging storm out
there. Yuki, we can take you home, too.

1:34:07.142 --> 1:34:09.394
Oh yeah, let's go, yuki.

1:34:09.602 --> 1:34:11.104
But...

1:34:11.312 --> 1:34:13.022
C'mon, hurry up.

1:34:13.231 --> 1:34:17.110
Thank you for offering,
but I think my mom will be here soon.

1:34:17.318 --> 1:34:18.736
You don't have to hold back.

1:34:18.945 --> 1:34:20.196
Yeah.

1:34:20.405 --> 1:34:22.907
I don't want to miss my mom when she comes.

1:34:23.116 --> 1:34:25.994
That's true. We'll leave first, then.

1:34:26.202 --> 1:34:27.202
Bye!

1:34:42.635 --> 1:34:44.137
Ame!

1:34:45.096 --> 1:34:48.266
Where are you? Ame!

1:34:48.474 --> 1:34:50.101
Ame!

1:34:59.319 --> 1:35:01.070
Ame...

1:35:01.779 --> 1:35:03.531
Where...?

1:35:18.004 --> 1:35:20.298
Sou's taking a long time.

1:35:23.009 --> 1:35:24.636
Yu ki...

1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:35.104
What, did yuki go home already?

1:35:35.730 --> 1:35:37.941
Attention everyone!

1:35:38.149 --> 1:35:40.389
We'll take everyone that's left
home in the school's car.

1:35:40.902 --> 1:35:41.902
“Emergency exit“

1:36:18.314 --> 1:36:20.316
Ame!

1:36:20.525 --> 1:36:21.776
Ame!

1:36:23.236 --> 1:36:24.529
Ame!

1:36:29.075 --> 1:36:30.410
Wait!

1:36:30.618 --> 1:36:32.996
Wait, ame!

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:37.185
Ame...

1:37:40.980 --> 1:37:43.232
Where are you...?

1:37:58.247 --> 1:37:59.540
Why are you here?

1:37:59.749 --> 1:38:01.250
Because...

1:38:02.210 --> 1:38:03.836
You were being slow.

1:38:04.045 --> 1:38:07.548
Oh, no one's here.
Did everyone go home already?

1:38:07.757 --> 1:38:10.385
I guess we're the only ones
not getting picked up.

1:38:11.511 --> 1:38:13.888
I wonder if something happened to my mom.

1:38:16.307 --> 1:38:17.016
It's cold.

1:38:17.225 --> 1:38:18.976
Let's walk around.

1:38:21.562 --> 1:38:22.313
Yuki.

1:38:22.522 --> 1:38:24.273
Oh, wait for me!

1:38:26.859 --> 1:38:29.320
What'll we do if no one
comes to pick us up?

1:38:29.529 --> 1:38:30.988
We can just live at school.

1:38:31.197 --> 1:38:32.490
We can't do that.

1:38:32.698 --> 1:38:34.700
We can sleep in the
nurse's office at night.

1:38:34.909 --> 1:38:35.909
What about food?

1:38:36.077 --> 1:38:37.870
We can eat leftover cafeteria food.

1:38:38.079 --> 1:38:41.207
What if no one ever comes to pick us up?
Will you live at school forever?

1:38:41.416 --> 1:38:44.293
I just have to get a job.
Delivering newspapers or something.

1:38:44.502 --> 1:38:46.963
You're just a kid. No
one's going to hire you.

1:38:47.171 --> 1:38:50.174
I'll lie about my age.
I'll tell them that I'm in middle school.

1:38:50.383 --> 1:38:52.593
Do I look like a middle schooler?

1:38:57.098 --> 1:38:58.724
Really?

1:39:02.186 --> 1:39:04.063
I want to grow up faster.

1:39:08.359 --> 1:39:09.694
Me too.

1:40:32.443 --> 1:40:33.736
Ame...

1:40:33.945 --> 1:40:38.157
He's probably shivering somewhere...

1:40:38.366 --> 1:40:41.786
He's probably lost... crying...

1:40:43.663 --> 1:40:49.835
I have to... protect... him...

1:40:51.629 --> 1:40:55.925
I have to... protect...

1:41:12.441 --> 1:41:14.235
Is anyone still here?

1:41:25.997 --> 1:41:27.498
He's gone.

1:41:31.168 --> 1:41:35.840
My heart's still pounding.
Hey, why did we hide?

1:41:37.300 --> 1:41:38.801
Hey!

1:41:48.185 --> 1:41:50.021
It's like the ocean.

1:41:50.229 --> 1:41:53.190
I feel like it's going to suck me in.

1:41:53.399 --> 1:41:56.736
Will we really end up living here secretly?

1:41:57.486 --> 1:41:59.726
If our parents don't come,
then we have no choice, do we?

1:41:59.780 --> 1:42:03.200
Wh? Your mom will come for sure.
Y

1:42:03.409 --> 1:42:04.493
no, she won't.

1:42:04.702 --> 1:42:06.787
Why not? She's...

1:42:10.333 --> 1:42:13.377
My mom got married.

1:42:13.586 --> 1:42:18.799
And she's having a baby. So once
it's born, I won't be needed anymore.

1:42:21.719 --> 1:42:24.889
But she was so worried about you...

1:42:25.097 --> 1:42:27.308
I'm fine with that, though.

1:42:27.516 --> 1:42:31.437
I'll run away from home
and become a boxer or a wrestler.

1:42:31.646 --> 1:42:33.648
I'll live like a lone wolf.

1:42:33.856 --> 1:42:36.192
What do you think? Will it work?

1:42:37.443 --> 1:42:39.362
You'll be defeated in a second.

1:42:39.570 --> 1:42:41.113
You have no muscles.

1:42:41.322 --> 1:42:42.322
I'll train.

1:42:42.365 --> 1:42:44.325
I'll train and live on my own.

1:42:56.462 --> 1:43:00.800
Sou, I want to be like you,

1:43:01.008 --> 1:43:04.887
and be able to smile
even when I'm telling the truth.

1:43:19.860 --> 1:43:21.570
Sou...

1:43:21.779 --> 1:43:22.863
That day,

1:43:23.072 --> 1:43:25.866
the wolf that hurt you was me...

1:43:31.122 --> 1:43:32.623
It was me.

1:43:36.711 --> 1:43:39.338
I kept thinking that I
had to say something.

1:43:42.758 --> 1:43:45.344
It hurt to hold it in.

1:43:49.181 --> 1:43:52.601
I already knew. I knew the whole time.

1:43:52.810 --> 1:43:56.564
I didn't tell anyone your secret.

1:43:57.690 --> 1:44:01.318
I won't tell. So...

1:44:01.527 --> 1:44:03.446
Don't cry anymore.

1:44:07.867 --> 1:44:10.578
I'm not crying, these are drops of rain.

1:44:20.755 --> 1:44:22.214
Thank you.

1:44:50.201 --> 1:44:52.953
Ame... where did you go?

1:44:54.872 --> 1:44:56.290
Ame?

1:44:59.627 --> 1:45:01.670
Ame.

1:45:01.879 --> 1:45:03.380
I was looking for you.

1:45:03.589 --> 1:45:06.967
Come on, hurry back
so we can go pick up yuki...

1:45:13.891 --> 1:45:15.142
Hana.

1:45:26.862 --> 1:45:28.739
I missed you so much!

1:45:29.949 --> 1:45:32.576
It's been hard, hasn't it?

1:45:32.785 --> 1:45:33.577
I'm sorry.

1:45:33.786 --> 1:45:35.871
It's okay.

1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:39.542
I was watching you the whole time.

1:45:39.750 --> 1:45:41.293
Yeah, I know.

1:45:41.502 --> 1:45:43.754
You raised our children well.

1:45:43.963 --> 1:45:47.258
No, that's not true. I keep messing up.

1:45:47.466 --> 1:45:48.843
It's true.

1:45:49.051 --> 1:45:51.262
Yuki and ame have both grown up fine.

1:45:51.470 --> 1:45:54.181
That's not true. Because...

1:45:54.390 --> 1:45:57.893
Oh... ame...

1:45:58.519 --> 1:46:01.188
That's right. Ame's gone.

1:46:04.275 --> 1:46:05.693
Ame!

1:46:05.901 --> 1:46:07.486
Ame's fine.

1:46:07.695 --> 1:46:09.446
But...

1:46:09.655 --> 1:46:10.906
He's fine.

1:46:11.115 --> 1:46:12.908
He's already an adult.

1:46:15.578 --> 1:46:17.204
An adult?

1:46:17.413 --> 1:46:19.790
He's found his own world.

1:47:02.791 --> 1:47:04.668
Ame?

1:47:07.046 --> 1:47:08.839
Oh, ame!

1:47:13.636 --> 1:47:15.846
Are you going to leave?

1:47:18.515 --> 1:47:20.434
But...

1:47:20.643 --> 1:47:24.438
I still haven't been able
to do anything for you.

1:47:26.065 --> 1:47:28.192
I still haven't...

1:47:30.110 --> 1:47:32.112
But you're still...

1:47:43.082 --> 1:47:44.625
Wait!

1:47:47.127 --> 1:47:48.587
Ame!

1:47:50.255 --> 1:47:51.882
Ame...!

1:47:56.178 --> 1:47:57.763
Ame...!

1:48:14.613 --> 1:48:15.948
Ame...

1:48:17.908 --> 1:48:19.284
Ame...

1:48:49.023 --> 1:48:51.650
Be well...

1:48:51.859 --> 1:48:53.736
Live a good life!

1:49:14.173 --> 1:49:15.883
Goodbye.

1:49:28.312 --> 1:49:32.900
Mother said that she
would never forget that morning.

1:49:34.026 --> 1:49:38.322
The freshly washed beech leaves...
The freshly washed spider webs...

1:49:38.530 --> 1:49:41.450
The freshly washed sky...

1:49:41.658 --> 1:49:49.658
Everything glittering under the sun...
Like the world had been reborn overnight.

1:49:51.085 --> 1:49:53.879
That was what mother thought.

1:50:18.904 --> 1:50:20.784
“Municipal junior high school
entrance ceremony“

1:50:21.448 --> 1:50:23.328
“municipal junior high school
entrance ceremony“

1:50:25.619 --> 1:50:27.388
“municipal junior high school
entrance ceremony“

1:50:27.412 --> 1:50:32.251
looking back on the twelve years
she spent raising us,

1:50:32.459 --> 1:50:37.213
mother smiled, saying that it was
over in a moment, like a fairy tale.

1:50:37.214 --> 1:50:38.506
“Junior high“

1:50:40.551 --> 1:50:41.551
“junior high“

1:50:43.679 --> 1:50:44.679
“junior high“

1:50:49.101 --> 1:50:51.353
“junior high“

1:50:58.694 --> 1:51:03.949
Mother is living quietly
in that mountain house even now.

1:51:28.849 --> 1:51:32.269
“Ame“ “the forest is alive“

1:51:49.620 --> 1:51:56.335
"I hope to meet you soon, “

1:51:56.543 --> 1:52:03.467
I always prayed as I rubbed my belly

1:52:03.675 --> 1:52:11.675
What will you look like?

1:52:16.772 --> 1:52:24.772
What will you sound like?

1:52:31.995 --> 1:52:38.043
Isee my reflection in your big eyes

1:52:38.252 --> 1:52:44.800
as teardrops spill onto your cheeks

1:52:45.008 --> 1:52:53.008
Come here, the food's ready!

1:52:57.813 --> 1:53:05.813
Come on, let's go for a walk!

1:53:11.493 --> 1:53:17.833
Your eyes swollen, you sit
with your arms around your knees

1:53:18.041 --> 1:53:24.506
tell me why you're
crying, tell me everything

1:53:24.715 --> 1:53:30.721
don't worry, I'm not going anywhere

1:53:30.929 --> 1:53:37.185
no matter what happens, we'll be together

1:53:37.394 --> 1:53:43.483
I love your smiling face

1:53:43.692 --> 1:53:49.865
it makes me feel better, even when I'm down

1:53:50.073 --> 1:53:58.073
Come here, let's sing!

1:54:02.210 --> 1:54:10.210
Come on,
let's raise our voices together!

1:54:14.848 --> 1:54:22.848
I want you to grow up brightly and freely

1:54:28.779 --> 1:54:34.326
Running in the snow, counting clouds

1:54:34.534 --> 1:54:40.207
playing in the rain,
being blown by the wind

1:54:40.415 --> 1:54:45.879
buried under flowers, playing grass kazoos

1:54:46.088 --> 1:54:51.843
on four feet, on two feet

1:54:52.052 --> 1:54:54.805
a new morning

1:54:55.013 --> 1:54:57.516
a new wind

1:54:57.724 --> 1:55:03.271
preparedjust for you

1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:06.024
a new morning

1:55:06.233 --> 1:55:08.860
a new light

1:55:09.069 --> 1:55:14.491
the world is yours for the taking

1:55:14.699 --> 1:55:17.327
a new morning

1:55:17.536 --> 1:55:20.205
a new rainbow

1:55:20.414 --> 1:55:25.919
the world is full of mystery

1:55:26.128 --> 1:55:34.128
choosing one of two paths,
eyes fixed on a point far away

1:55:45.147 --> 1:55:53.147
Is there nothing else I can do for you?

1:56:00.412 --> 1:56:08.412
Whenever you decide to leave,
I will see you off with a smile

1:56:18.513 --> 1:56:26.513
But I'll still be a little sad

1:56:30.233 --> 1:56:38.233
Please, live a good life
