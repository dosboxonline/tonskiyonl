00:15.833 --> 00:17.041
[The Watcher] <i>In the beginning,</i>

00:17.541 --> 00:21.333
<i>before the Six Singularities
and the dawn of creation,</i>

00:21.833 --> 00:23.875
<i>came the Celestials.</i>

00:24.666 --> 00:29.125
[speaking Latin]

00:30.125 --> 00:35.790
Now, with the power of
the Eternal Guardians flowing through me,

00:35.791 --> 00:41.833
let the power of creation
bring forth my rebirth!

00:43.791 --> 00:44.791
[grunts]

00:46.958 --> 00:49.249
My rebirth! My rebirth!

00:49.250 --> 00:51.707
Okay, well, that's not working. Howard?

00:51.708 --> 00:53.415
And cut!

00:53.416 --> 00:55.875
Okay, let's reset.
We'll do it one more time.

00:56.583 --> 01:00.165
[man] <i>In this universe,
Agatha Harkness' quest for power led her</i>

01:00.166 --> 01:03.500
<i>to discover the Celestial growing deep
within the Earth.</i>

01:04.375 --> 01:06.790
<i>Looking to take
its cosmic energy for herself,</i>

01:06.791 --> 01:10.041
<i>she set out to design a spell
to siphon its power.</i>

01:10.583 --> 01:15.500
<i>But pulling off a ritual of that scale
would require an equally big production.</i>

01:16.125 --> 01:19.749
<i>So, she turned to a blossoming industry
that had built its reputation</i>

01:19.750 --> 01:23.291
<i>financing the big dreams
of even bigger egos.</i>

01:23.875 --> 01:24.874
<i>Hollywood.</i>

01:24.875 --> 01:28.499
<i>Where upstart mogul, Howard Stark,
was happy to foot the bill.</i>

01:28.500 --> 01:32.290
Agatha, darling, those in-camera effects,
I still don't know how you do it!

01:32.291 --> 01:34.290
Just a little bit of "movie magic."

01:34.291 --> 01:37.290
But it's not working.
This spell is just not working!

01:37.291 --> 01:40.374
In the scene, that is.
We may need to, uh, re-stage.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.832
Fantastic! That's lunch, everyone.

01:42.833 --> 01:45.208
Now, where's my AD? Jarvis? Jarvis!

01:45.708 --> 01:47.790
Don't tell me. Not more new pages.

01:47.791 --> 01:50.790
We have already re-shot
the Third Act set piece five times.

01:50.791 --> 01:53.124
And we'll shoot it a hundred more,
if that's what it takes!

01:53.125 --> 01:55.707
To add what?
Another mind-numbing action spectacle?

01:55.708 --> 01:58.332
Big fights? Bigger explosions?
I think we've seen it.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.790
- You know, you're right.
- I am?

01:59.791 --> 02:01.582
- He is?
- We need to expand this picture

02:01.583 --> 02:03.082
to give it that oomph I'm missing.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.082
We need more star power.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.165
- A co-star!
- How can I steal the show

02:07.166 --> 02:08.749
when there's no one to steal it from.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.540
Of course! The Capulets had the Montagues.
The Hatfields, the McCoys.

02:11.541 --> 02:13.624
My auntie had the recluse
in the apartment upstairs.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.582
You need a foil!
A perfectly placed grain of salt

02:15.583 --> 02:17.624
to complement the seasonings
simmering in the pan!

02:17.625 --> 02:19.249
Anything but more actors.

02:19.250 --> 02:22.665
I can see it now. Our Cosmic Queen
is sitting on a hand no one else can beat.

02:22.666 --> 02:25.499
That is, until a mysterious new player
blows into town,

02:25.500 --> 02:26.790
hot on her lofty ambitions.

02:26.791 --> 02:29.290
Yes, yes. Do they fight?
Do they fall in love?

02:29.291 --> 02:33.207
No, they'll dance. With dozens
of backup dancers on each side.

02:33.208 --> 02:36.707
And we'll lift the lighting rig
so the sets can be three times as tall.

02:36.708 --> 02:38.165
- Yes!
- Wait. No. No, no.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.249
Jarvis! It's about time
you caught the creative bug.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.624
- I wasn't--
- That is just genius.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.040
- It's a disaster.
- Who we thinking?

02:43.041 --> 02:45.207
Bogie? Gable?
Cary Grant does owe me a favor.

02:45.208 --> 02:49.000
No, no, there's only one actor on Earth
who can complete our picture.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.708
I thought I could do it without him,
but now I see.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.291
I need him.

02:53.916 --> 02:54.916
Kingo.

03:01.875 --> 03:02.916
[The Watcher] <i>Time.</i>

03:06.375 --> 03:07.458
<i>Space.</i>

03:09.208 --> 03:10.250
<i>Reality.</i>

03:13.125 --> 03:14.791
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

03:19.666 --> 03:24.166
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility.</i>

03:26.708 --> 03:30.125
<i>Where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

03:32.916 --> 03:35.666
<i>creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.</i>

03:39.791 --> 03:41.125
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

03:43.375 --> 03:46.541
<i>I am your guide
through these vast new realities.</i>

03:47.958 --> 03:51.458
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

03:55.125 --> 03:56.750
<i>"What if?"</i>

04:27.041 --> 04:28.041
[Jarvis] Mr. Kingo.

04:28.583 --> 04:31.749
I'm Edwin Jarvis,
Mr. Stark's personal butler and second AD.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.624
Welcome to Stark Pictures.

04:33.625 --> 04:34.915
[Kingo] Wow!

04:34.916 --> 04:37.415
And I thought we did things
over-the-top in Bollywood.

04:37.416 --> 04:40.790
I've always been partial to the axiom
that "less is more."

04:40.791 --> 04:42.165
But for Mr. Stark--

04:42.166 --> 04:43.624
More is just the opening offer.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.457
Kingo, it's an honor to have you onboard.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.040
Now, this number we've put together
is off the charts. Literally.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.707
I've got enough dancers in there
to light up a Richter scale.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.582
You ready to cross steps
with our leading lady?

04:52.583 --> 04:56.040
Howard, something tells me
this is a part I was born to play.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.332
[Howard laughs]
The lights are hot, cameras loaded,

04:58.333 --> 05:00.249
and safeties removed
from all our pyrotechnics!

05:00.250 --> 05:01.332
What? I'm sorry, what?

05:01.333 --> 05:02.665
Is there anything else you need?

05:02.666 --> 05:04.915
- I'm more than ready.
- What about the choreography?

05:04.916 --> 05:07.332
- Was it up to snuff?
- Yes. The moves are great,

05:07.333 --> 05:10.040
but I assume there's room
for a little improvisation?

05:10.041 --> 05:12.749
Absolutely! Absolutely!
Kingo, I'll be honest with you.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.082
This one's gonna be a doozy.
A real barn burner.

05:15.083 --> 05:17.124
The biggest scene
ever captured on celluloid.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.332
Don't worry, Howard.

05:18.333 --> 05:21.833
I've been preparing for our showdown
for quite some time.

05:23.416 --> 05:27.040
Okay, people! This is it.
Our big musical number.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.457
- I want glitz. I want glamour.
- [indistinct chatter]

05:29.458 --> 05:31.458
I want emotion! I want commotion!

05:32.041 --> 05:34.375
I want you to wow me
with your razzle-dazzle.

05:35.083 --> 05:38.874
I want Busby Berkeley to see this
and contemplate becoming a realtor!

05:38.875 --> 05:40.415
[man] Quiet on set!

05:40.416 --> 05:41.750
- [alarm ringing]
- [Howard] Lights!

05:42.708 --> 05:43.791
Camera!

05:45.666 --> 05:46.666
[man] TR 62, take one.

05:47.666 --> 05:49.291
And...

05:50.083 --> 05:51.082
action!

05:51.083 --> 05:52.707
[gongs sounding]

05:52.708 --> 05:54.249
[door opens]

05:54.250 --> 05:56.166
[Bollywood song playing]

06:29.541 --> 06:30.541
[music fades]

06:31.291 --> 06:33.332
[jive music playing]

06:33.333 --> 06:37.457
The challenge has been made.
Will our Cosmic Queen heed the call?

06:37.458 --> 06:39.583
Move in, Camera A.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.708
She answers!

06:53.291 --> 06:54.916
There she is.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.374
There he is.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.707
It's all led up to this.

06:58.708 --> 07:01.415
The final Eternal champion arrives
at the zero hour,

07:01.416 --> 07:04.582
in a last, desperate bid
to stay the queen's cosmic hand!

07:04.583 --> 07:06.666
[jive music continues]

07:12.625 --> 07:14.250

07:45.291 --> 07:47.291

07:51.666 --> 07:54.624
[Howard] Will she defeat him?
Will he defeat her?

07:54.625 --> 07:56.000
Will they dance?

07:58.208 --> 07:59.583
They will!

08:01.708 --> 08:04.500
You're the missing piece
I've been waiting lifetimes for.

08:06.875 --> 08:09.874
Oh, I know. But I'm here
to put your vanity project

08:09.875 --> 08:11.208
into turnaround.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.790
So, you "know" know. [chuckles]

08:16.791 --> 08:18.415
And you still had the stones to show up.

08:18.416 --> 08:19.958
Someone needs to stop you.

08:21.875 --> 08:24.290
Oh, honey, I'm just out here
making blockbusters.

08:24.291 --> 08:27.166
You and the Eternals are the ones
who wanna destroy the world.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.666
You have no idea
what forces you're meddling with.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.208
Right back at ya.

08:41.916 --> 08:43.915
A little advice, one hoofer to another.

08:43.916 --> 08:45.583
In this town?

08:46.583 --> 08:48.791
Never mess
with Number One on the Call Sheet.

08:52.916 --> 08:54.708
Okay, Kingo. Make this look good!

08:58.791 --> 09:00.333
Hot dog! That was out of this world!

09:02.416 --> 09:04.416
[jive music ramps up]

09:13.666 --> 09:16.082
[pants] Okay. Show's over.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.750
Time to break out the big guns.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.332
[pulsing, explosion]

09:20.333 --> 09:21.457
Oh, that's not in the script.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.207
Is that in the script?
Are these blue pages?

09:23.208 --> 09:25.125
Shush, Jarvis! It's great! Keep shooting!

09:27.083 --> 09:30.499
Uh, I'm sorry.
Your powers are "finger pistols"?

09:30.500 --> 09:31.999
Okay. No.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.332
I fire energy. Projections.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.375
Ah, right. From your fingers.
Pew! Pew! [chuckles]

09:39.791 --> 09:42.124
Okay. No-- Stop with your hands. Stop!

09:42.125 --> 09:44.332
Listen, these powers are cool.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.958
A lot of people think
these powers are very cool.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.333
- [laughs]
- [shield whirring]

09:49.750 --> 09:52.082
What? Those powers are Thena's!

09:52.083 --> 09:54.499
And Makkari's and Gilgamesh's
and everyone else's.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.583
[pulsing]

09:56.791 --> 09:58.833
- Oh!
- Yes!

10:00.750 --> 10:01.750
- [fire roars]
- Ah!

10:05.666 --> 10:06.666
Yes!

10:07.791 --> 10:08.791
Ow!

10:09.791 --> 10:10.790
Whoa!

10:10.791 --> 10:11.875
Oh!

10:27.666 --> 10:28.666
[Kingo groans]

10:32.333 --> 10:33.332
[music fades, stops]

10:33.333 --> 10:34.874
[Howard] And... cut!

10:34.875 --> 10:36.124
[bell ringing]

10:36.125 --> 10:39.040
Wowza! That chemistry was hotter
than the Hindenburg!

10:39.041 --> 10:41.249
I really believed
you two wanted to kill each other.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.166
Oh! [chuckles] No, no, no.
We're just acting.

10:43.666 --> 10:45.290
Totally just acting.

10:45.291 --> 10:48.582
Both of us just acting so hard right now.

10:48.583 --> 10:51.833
Oh, really? I'd say one of us
is acting really bad right now.

10:52.708 --> 10:56.040
This calls for a celebration!
After-party! My place!

10:56.041 --> 10:57.832
- Jarvis, give 'em the deets.
- Fine.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.290
Top of the hill, everybody.
Just above the Hollywoodland sign.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.333
It's the house that will make you question
the decency of capitalism.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.208
[door rumbles]

11:09.833 --> 11:11.957
If you mean to kill me, be forewarned.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.790
I know several heart-wrenching,
dying monologues,

11:14.791 --> 11:16.415
and I will regale you with them.

11:16.416 --> 11:19.874
Oh, Kingo. You've pegged me
as the villain of this picture,

11:19.875 --> 11:21.124
but you've got it all wrong.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.290
I'm the hero.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.874
You killed my friends, stole their powers.

11:24.875 --> 11:29.374
Relax. I didn't kill anyone.
I "borrowed" their powers.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.915
I assure you, your friends
are all safe and sound in storage.

11:32.916 --> 11:36.165
The backlot has a creature shop.
They blend right in. [chuckles]

11:36.166 --> 11:38.290
Agatha, release them.

11:38.291 --> 11:41.583
Swear on the Oscar I plan to win, I will.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.040
Once I have saved my world

11:44.041 --> 11:48.083
from that Third Act surprise you've got
brewing in the center of the Earth.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.582
But...

11:49.583 --> 11:51.540
[sighs] And this is the hard part.

11:51.541 --> 11:54.000
I can't do it without you, Kingo.

11:55.166 --> 11:59.500
I need your energy to complete my spell,
to save everything I know and love.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.165
Arishem made me the new Prime Eternal.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.790
I need to protect Tiamut

12:03.791 --> 12:06.332
and the billions of lives
his Emergence will create.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.665
Sorry, scout, but I can see you reaching.

12:08.666 --> 12:10.790
There's no way Arishem won you over

12:10.791 --> 12:14.832
with some golden ball
and top billing on a doomed planet.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.582
You aren't like the other Eternals.

12:16.583 --> 12:17.957
And what makes you say that?

12:17.958 --> 12:21.499
Because you haven't just lived
among humanity,

12:21.500 --> 12:23.625
you have lived as them.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.165
Oh!

12:25.166 --> 12:29.790
[Agatha] Seeing the beauty,
telling their stories

12:29.791 --> 12:34.333
showing them who they really are
as only an actor can.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.207
Oh, that is true.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.166
Acting is
the most noble profession on Earth.

12:39.666 --> 12:42.457
But do you really expect me
to betray Arishem?

12:42.458 --> 12:45.915
Forsake a mission I've dedicated eons to?

12:45.916 --> 12:47.165
Never going to happen.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.874
- Never.
- I can get Howard to offer you

12:48.875 --> 12:50.582
- a three-picture deal.
- Okay, I'll do it.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.415
Oh. I guess I should've led with that.

12:52.416 --> 12:54.790
But I'm gonna need
full green light approval,

12:54.791 --> 12:56.207
and my own shingle on the lot.

12:56.208 --> 13:00.165
Ooh. Plus, I've been looking to transition
into indulgent, art house fair.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.374
You know, no plot.

13:01.375 --> 13:04.041
Abrupt, arbitrary cuts. Cut!

13:06.000 --> 13:08.875
Me staring into camera
with no expression on my face.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.957
That last one sounds like a nightmare.

13:12.958 --> 13:17.124
But for the literal sake of the world,
I guess I'll allow it.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.000
And you have to bring back my friends.

13:19.708 --> 13:22.624
Very well.
Let's get this show on the road.

13:22.625 --> 13:23.791
[crackling]

13:28.875 --> 13:32.499
[Arishem] Did you think
I would not see your failure?

13:32.500 --> 13:34.582
You have chosen your side.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.791
And now, you will die on it.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.290
[exhales sharply] Arishem is coming.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.916
It would take the power
of another Celestial to stop him.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.874
Another Celestial.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.165
[laughs]

13:49.166 --> 13:50.875
Fasten your seat belt, honey.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.250
It's time for my makeover.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.583
- [jive music playing]
- [indistinct shouting]

13:59.541 --> 14:02.165
[Howard] Jarvis, this night's shaping up
to be an instant classic.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.165
Yes. I suppose if the relevant metric
is "property damage."

14:05.166 --> 14:07.915
Howard! Hi. You're still conscious.
Can we chat?

14:07.916 --> 14:09.832
Aggie! Kingo! About time!

14:09.833 --> 14:10.999
Jarvis, bust out the grappa!

14:11.000 --> 14:12.957
Sorry, Howard. No time for digestifs.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.499
Still, maybe pour it anyway, though.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.499
We had a bout of creative inspiration.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.749
Is that some kinda euphemism?
Are you two a thing now?

14:18.750 --> 14:20.375
- Sorry. Not my type.
- Sorry. Not my type.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.749
But we do have chemistry.

14:22.750 --> 14:25.499
And with Kingo's help, we've finally
cracked the Third Act set piece.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.457
Amazing! I'll check out
the pages first thing--

14:27.458 --> 14:29.790
No, no, no. We can't risk sitting
on these creative juices.

14:29.791 --> 14:31.165
We gotta shoot this finale--

14:31.166 --> 14:32.249
- Now!
- Right now!

14:32.250 --> 14:34.999
Impossible. When Ms. Harkness opted
to rewrite the Third Act,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.374
for the sixth time, I might add,
we broke down the sets.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.207
"Broke down the--"
What are you talking about?

14:40.208 --> 14:41.290
Ugh, damn it!

14:41.291 --> 14:44.707
You've no idea how many runes
I had to paint by hand on those sets.

14:44.708 --> 14:46.124
Come on. Think, think, think.

14:46.125 --> 14:50.624
There's gotta be a cursed swamp,
a haunted house, something we can use.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.040
Bingo, baby! Griffith Observatory.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.999
It should be big enough for all the runes.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.582
We can shoot the finale there!

14:56.583 --> 14:59.874
And with what dark magic do you expect me
to pull permits at this hour?

14:59.875 --> 15:02.165
For that kind of production value,
I'll buy the joint.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.999
Load up the limo, Jarvis!
We're doin' a company move!

15:05.000 --> 15:06.583
Actually, let's take our ride.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.625
Oh, my...

15:12.708 --> 15:13.791
An alien spaceship.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.707
I gotta hand it to you, Aggie.
You had me fooled.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.124
- I thought you were a witch.
- Yes.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.832
- But he's the space alien.
- Wait. What?

15:19.833 --> 15:21.707
Technically, I'm more of a space robot.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.249
- You are?
- [laughs]

15:23.250 --> 15:24.790
Howard, you knew?

15:24.791 --> 15:25.915
You knew?

15:25.916 --> 15:26.999
I'm Howard Stark!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.082
I'm the smartest person on Earth.
Of course, I knew.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.957
I also knew I'd save
a hell of a lot of money

15:30.958 --> 15:32.957
on special effects using actual magic.

15:32.958 --> 15:36.749
Look, everyone in this town has a secret.
It's what makes it interesting.

15:36.750 --> 15:40.749
So, whatever's about to go down,
I'm here for you. Just let me film it.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.374
But once we save the day,
I want a look under your hood.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.125
I am sensing major patent potential.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.125
Okay, y'all. Let's do it.

16:05.541 --> 16:07.874
Okay. We've got five cameras set up
for maximum coverage.

16:07.875 --> 16:09.957
"A" Camera's gonna be trained on Agatha.

16:09.958 --> 16:14.500
Um, I think you're gonna wanna swap out
the lens for something... wider.

16:17.000 --> 16:17.999
Jarvis!

16:18.000 --> 16:20.249
[Agatha sighs] Jarvis. Jarvis, please.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.332
The line needs to be more confident.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.832
This also needs a little touch-up, okay?
Lean into the room's energy.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.374
If you'll forgive me, Ms. Harkness.

16:27.375 --> 16:30.332
We didn't do a lot of occult rituals
when I trained at Balmoral.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.749
Hey, sassy,
I suggested we bring in the set dec team,

16:32.750 --> 16:34.582
but you said
we couldn't afford the overages.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.332
So, now we're here with your lame energy.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.416
Aggie?

16:39.458 --> 16:41.083
Is that part of the opening act?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.915
[grunting]

16:43.916 --> 16:44.999
Arishem.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.125
Okay. Then, places, people! It's showtime.

16:50.458 --> 16:56.250
[speaking Latin]

16:59.250 --> 17:00.875
[enchanting pinging]

17:02.625 --> 17:05.999
Not gonna lie,
getting some ritual sacrifice vibes here.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.457
You look great.
Chin up! Chin up! That's it.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.665
And start making space for that Oscar.

17:10.666 --> 17:15.165
From the stars in the sky
to the depths of the Earth.

17:15.166 --> 17:21.249
Let the power of creation
bring forth my rebirth!

17:21.250 --> 17:22.791
[rumbling]

17:24.583 --> 17:25.750
[screams]

17:27.541 --> 17:31.083
[screams]

17:39.166 --> 17:40.249
[pants]

17:40.250 --> 17:43.165
Finally, your power will be mine!

17:43.166 --> 17:44.541
[rumbling]

17:58.375 --> 18:00.000
[explosion]

18:09.666 --> 18:11.666
[screaming]

18:14.083 --> 18:16.082
[gasps] Should we be concerned?

18:16.083 --> 18:18.125
We'll be legends!

18:21.125 --> 18:22.125
[strains, grunts]

18:24.458 --> 18:25.916
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

18:27.291 --> 18:28.541
[both scream]

18:52.833 --> 18:54.833
[crowd gasping]

19:02.333 --> 19:04.999
Oh, she is beautiful.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.249
Are you getting this?

19:06.250 --> 19:09.166
This is the greatest footage ever shot!

19:13.833 --> 19:15.250
This is gold!

19:17.666 --> 19:22.000
This power, it's... everything.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.333
- [loud rumbling]
- [gasps]

19:30.375 --> 19:32.375
[crowd gasping]

19:39.166 --> 19:41.916
It's him. He's here.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.582
[Arishem] It must feel strange

19:45.583 --> 19:47.749
for such a primitive being

19:47.750 --> 19:51.415
to suddenly possess a power so cosmic.

19:51.416 --> 19:56.332
Oh, honey, cosmic is just my size.
Haven't you seen the marquee?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.665
I'm a star.

19:57.666 --> 20:01.582
You are a heretic, Agatha Harkness.

20:01.583 --> 20:04.457
And you will be judged as such.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.125
Oh, yeah? Judge this. Boom!

20:09.583 --> 20:10.582
[Agatha grunts]

20:10.583 --> 20:13.665
Oh, boy! Cecil B. DeMille's
gonna be pissed when he sees this footage.

20:13.666 --> 20:14.749
Film it! Film it!

20:14.750 --> 20:17.040
I'm filming it!
I'm filming it! I'm filming it!

20:17.041 --> 20:20.625
Howard, something tells me
she's got the whole world watching.

20:26.750 --> 20:27.749
Hah!

20:27.750 --> 20:29.040
[Arishem grunts]

20:29.041 --> 20:30.290
Yes!

20:30.291 --> 20:32.832
Your vanity blinds you.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.166
[groans]

20:36.416 --> 20:37.416
[grunts]

20:38.833 --> 20:40.375
- Oh!
- No!

20:40.916 --> 20:43.249
A Celestial creates life.

20:43.250 --> 20:46.666
It does not glorify its own existence.

20:55.958 --> 20:57.707
When will you see?

20:57.708 --> 21:01.915
You will always be too human
to wield such power.

21:01.916 --> 21:04.415
Oh, that's cute. You think I missed?

21:04.416 --> 21:07.583
Truth is,
I was just getting you to hit your mark.

21:16.416 --> 21:18.540
What? How did you?

21:18.541 --> 21:20.749
It's called acting, love.

21:20.750 --> 21:24.458
And I'm afraid you are
the next character I'm gonna become.

21:25.416 --> 21:28.375
[Arishem screams]

21:29.958 --> 21:30.958
[screams]

21:34.458 --> 21:35.458
[crowd gasps]

21:43.125 --> 21:45.707
Humdinger. That's a showstopper.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.999
Eddie, tell me you were in focus.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.665
Yes, I think we've got it.

21:49.666 --> 21:51.124
[Howard laughs] The angles!

21:51.125 --> 21:53.290
Performance of a lifetime, Agatha.

21:53.291 --> 21:54.874
I think that's a wrap.

21:54.875 --> 21:58.249
Oh, Kingo. The show's not over yet.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.290
Agatha, what are you doing?

22:00.291 --> 22:03.999
With this power?
Anything I damn well please.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.290
But I thought...

22:05.291 --> 22:09.124
That I wanted to save the world
from the Emergence? Please.

22:09.125 --> 22:13.790
I played the reluctant hero
for a hot minute to get what I needed.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.500
- You.
- [gasps]

22:17.083 --> 22:18.249
Now,

22:18.250 --> 22:21.124
kneel before me.

22:21.125 --> 22:23.582
- Yes, my queen.
- Oh, yes!

22:23.583 --> 22:26.207
Savin' the big twist
for the Third Act reel!

22:26.208 --> 22:27.665
[Kingo] Howard, take it seriously.

22:27.666 --> 22:30.040
With her magic
and now the power of two Celestials,

22:30.041 --> 22:33.457
she can destroy the whole world
and remake it however she wants.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.499
Surely, you've worked
with difficult actors before.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.040
Must be a way to get through to her.

22:37.041 --> 22:38.582
I mean, all actors are difficult.

22:38.583 --> 22:41.875
We're all sensitive 'cause
we're opening up our souls, so the--

22:43.041 --> 22:44.666
Jarvis, you're a genius.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.166
Agatha, stop.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.165
I would have thought
you'd have realized by now

22:51.166 --> 22:54.749
I'm not an actress
who likes to take direction!

22:54.750 --> 22:56.625
Now, kneel before me.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.332
This isn't you.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.207
You don't know me.

23:00.208 --> 23:01.582
[Kingo] Of course, I do.

23:01.583 --> 23:03.249
Because you're just like me,

23:03.250 --> 23:05.875
and everyone else
who came to this stupid town.

23:06.625 --> 23:10.332
At some point, somewhere in our lives,
the world made us feel small,

23:10.333 --> 23:11.875
so we set out to show them.

23:12.916 --> 23:15.374
But, Agatha,
you never needed all this power.

23:15.375 --> 23:18.749
Because you've always had
the only magic you'd ever really needed

23:18.750 --> 23:20.082
to leave your mark on the world.

23:20.083 --> 23:21.999
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.749
And what magic is that?

23:23.750 --> 23:24.833
[Kingo] The movies.

23:25.666 --> 23:28.665
The movies are magic, Agatha.

23:28.666 --> 23:29.999
Hell, they're better than magic.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.624
Because they change the world
by changing people.

23:32.625 --> 23:35.165
By making them feel something real.

23:35.166 --> 23:38.457
And with that kind of power,
you don't have to be feared.

23:38.458 --> 23:41.416
Because you can be adored.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.790
[sentimental music playing]

23:45.791 --> 23:49.833
You can't possibly understand
how long I've worked for this.

23:50.333 --> 23:53.458
Well, I've been on Earth
for thousands of years, so I kinda do.

23:54.375 --> 23:57.291
And if you're anything like me,
maybe all this time,

23:57.833 --> 24:00.166
you've just been looking
for the right collaborator.

24:05.916 --> 24:07.291
So, what do you say?

24:07.958 --> 24:10.833
Wanna change the world? For real?

24:34.583 --> 24:36.124
[reporter] Reporting live from Hollywood,

24:36.125 --> 24:39.457
where there's more stars on the red carpet
than there are in the sky.

24:39.458 --> 24:40.540
[woman] Over here. One more!

24:40.541 --> 24:43.332
[man] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark!
The trades are predicting a blockbuster.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.957
What will it mean for your weapons biz?

24:44.958 --> 24:48.082
Wars, my friend, are a thing of the past.
Cinema is the future.

24:48.083 --> 24:51.040
[indistinct shouting, cameras flashing]

24:51.041 --> 24:53.374
Kingo and I, we wanted to make a movie

24:53.375 --> 24:56.291
that would, well... change the world.

24:56.875 --> 24:57.874
And I think we did.

24:57.875 --> 25:01.290
- Some sparks flew, that's for sure.
- [laughs heartily]

25:01.291 --> 25:03.082
Now, just wait for the sequel.

25:03.083 --> 25:05.041
- [man] Hey, Kingo!
- [woman] Agatha!

25:08.833 --> 25:10.874
That sequel could come
sooner than you think.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.165
Since you revived them,

25:12.166 --> 25:14.707
Ajak and the other Eternals
are pretty concerned

25:14.708 --> 25:18.665
that killing Arishem has probably
drawn the Celestials' attention.

25:18.666 --> 25:21.582
Hah! Too bad for them.
We thrive on attention.

25:21.583 --> 25:22.665
[chuckles nervously]

25:22.666 --> 25:24.790
Yeah, but this is
the bad kind of attention.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.957
Oh, darling,
we can save that for the sequel.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.290
[chuckles softly]

25:28.291 --> 25:32.332
Oh, my God! It looks so gorgeous!

25:32.333 --> 25:34.166
This is so beautiful!

25:36.416 --> 25:38.457
[The Watcher]
<i>Everyone has a story worth telling.</i>

25:38.458 --> 25:41.666
<i>Even two lost souls on the wrong path.</i>

25:42.375 --> 25:45.958
<i>But sometimes,
all it takes is a trip to the movies</i>

25:46.500 --> 25:49.958
<i>to remind you that anything is possible.</i>

25:51.041 --> 25:52.500
<i>Even a happy ending.</i>

25:55.291 --> 25:57.957
<i>Then again,
who doesn't love a cliffhanger?</i>

25:57.958 --> 26:01.041
[upbeat jazz music playing]

26:58.041 --> 27:01.041
[music continues]

28:13.000 --> 28:14.583
[Howard] <i>And cut!</i>
