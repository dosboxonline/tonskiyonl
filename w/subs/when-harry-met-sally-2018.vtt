00:31.116 --> 00:34.119
(upbeat piano music)

02:14.844 --> 02:17.305
I was sitting with my
friend, Arthur Cornbloom,

02:18.473 --> 02:19.640
in a restaurant.

02:19.641 --> 02:21.643
It was an Horn & Hardart cafeteria

02:22.936 --> 02:27.689
and this beautiful girl walked
in and I turned to Arthur

02:27.690 --> 02:30.943
and I said, "Arthur, you see that girl?

02:30.944 --> 02:32.861
"I'm going to marry her."

02:32.862 --> 02:35.656
And two weeks later we were married

02:35.657 --> 02:40.495
and it's over 50 years later
and we are still married.

No, you're there already, you can start.

I'll call you before that.

04:02.327 --> 04:03.535

04:03.536 --> 04:04.369
- I miss you.
- Huh?

I miss you already.

04:05.205 --> 04:06.121

04:24.265 --> 04:25.933
I have it all figured out.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.017
It's an 18 hour trip,

04:27.018 --> 04:29.478
which breaks down into six
shifts of three hours each

04:29.479 --> 04:32.398
or alternatively we can
break it down by mileage.

04:34.359 --> 04:37.152
There's a map on the visor

04:37.153 --> 04:39.488
that I've marked to show the locations

04:39.489 --> 04:41.198
where we can change shifts.

No, I don't like to eat between meals.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.501
I'll roll down the window.

05:00.385 --> 05:02.262
Why don't you tell me
the story of your life?

05:05.139 --> 05:06.473
The story of my life?

05:06.474 --> 05:09.476
We got 18 hours to kill
before we hit New York.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.769
The story of my life isn't even gonna

05:10.770 --> 05:11.770
get us out of Chicago.

05:11.771 --> 05:13.563
I mean, nothing's happened to me yet.

05:13.564 --> 05:14.856
That's why I'm going to New York.

05:14.857 --> 05:15.941
So something happened to you?

05:15.942 --> 05:17.734
- Yes.
- Like what?

05:17.735 --> 05:20.445
Like I'm going journalism
school to become a reporter.

05:20.446 --> 05:24.449
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.867
That's one way to look at it.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.452
Suppose nothing happens to you.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.413
Suppose you lived out your
whole life and nothing happens,

05:29.414 --> 05:31.415
you never meet anybody,
you never become anything

05:31.416 --> 05:33.458
and finally you die in one
of those New York deaths

05:33.459 --> 05:34.751
where nobody notices for two weeks

05:34.752 --> 05:36.713
until the smell drifts into the hallway.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.591
[Sally] Amanda mentioned
you had a dark side.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.884
[Harry] That's what drew her to me.

05:42.885 --> 05:43.719
[Sally] Your dark side.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.553
Sure.

05:44.554 --> 05:46.555
Why, don't you have a dark side?

05:46.556 --> 05:48.181
No, you're probably one
of those cheerful people

05:48.182 --> 05:50.309
who dots their i's with little hearts.

05:50.310 --> 05:53.020
I have just as much of a
dark side as the next person.

05:53.021 --> 05:54.062
Oh really.

05:54.063 --> 05:56.565
When I buy a new book, I always
read the last page first.

05:56.566 --> 05:59.401
That way, in case I die before
I finish, I know how it ends.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.070
That, my friend, is a dark side.

06:02.155 --> 06:03.655
That doesn't mean
you're deep or anything.

06:03.656 --> 06:04.656
I mean,

06:04.657 --> 06:06.825
yes, basically I'm a happy person.

06:06.826 --> 06:07.659
[Harry] So am I.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.536
And I don't see that there's
anything wrong with that.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.829
Of course not, you're
too busy being happy.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.998
Do you ever think about death?

06:12.999 --> 06:13.957
Yes.

06:13.958 --> 06:14.791
Sure you do.

06:14.792 --> 06:15.625
A fleeting thought that jumps in and out

06:15.626 --> 06:16.752
of the transient of your mind.

06:16.753 --> 06:18.128
I spend hours, I spend days.

06:18.129 --> 06:20.881
And you think this
makes you a better person?

06:20.882 --> 06:22.507
Look, when the shit comes down,

06:22.508 --> 06:24.051
I'm gonna be prepared and you're
not, that's all I'm saying.

06:24.052 --> 06:25.886
And in the mean time, you're gonna ruin

06:25.887 --> 06:27.388
your whole life waiting for it.

06:31.476 --> 06:34.687
(pleasant piano music)

06:36.230 --> 06:37.064
You're wrong!

06:37.065 --> 06:37.898
[Harry] I'm not wrong.

06:37.899 --> 06:38.732
[Sally] You're wrong!

06:38.733 --> 06:39.691
[Harry] He wants her to leave.

06:39.692 --> 06:40.901
That's why he puts her on the plane.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.694
[Sally] I don't think she wants to stay.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.112
[Harry] Of course she wants to stay.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.864
Wouldn't you rather be
with Humphrey Bogart

06:45.865 --> 06:46.698
than the other guy?

06:46.699 --> 06:48.909
[Sally] I don't want to
spend the rest of my life

06:48.910 --> 06:52.537
in Casablanca married
to a man who runs a bar.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.165
That probably sounds very
snobbish to you but I don't.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.875
[Harry] You'd rather be
in a passionless marriage.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.794
[Sally] And be the First
Lady of Czechoslovakia.

06:58.795 --> 06:59.795
Than live with the man you've had

06:59.796 --> 07:01.630
the greatest sex of you life with,

07:01.631 --> 07:04.674
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

07:04.675 --> 07:06.176
Yes.

07:06.177 --> 07:08.220
And so would any woman in her right mind.

07:08.221 --> 07:10.764
Women are very practical,
even Ingrid Bergman,

07:10.765 --> 07:13.976
which is why she gets on the
plane at the end of the movie.

07:17.772 --> 07:18.564
I understand.

07:19.941 --> 07:21.274
What?

07:21.275 --> 07:22.109
What?

07:22.110 --> 07:23.151
Nothing.

07:23.152 --> 07:23.985
What?

07:23.986 --> 07:25.112
Forget about it.

07:25.113 --> 07:26.655
What, forget about what?

07:26.656 --> 07:27.656
It's not important.

07:27.657 --> 07:28.491
Just tell me.

07:30.326 --> 07:33.245
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

07:33.246 --> 07:34.746
Two please.

07:34.747 --> 07:35.747
- Right over there.
- (crowed commotion)

07:35.748 --> 07:36.915
- Yes I have.
- (crowed commotion)

07:36.916 --> 07:37.916
- No you haven't.
- (crowed commotion)

07:37.917 --> 07:41.128
It just so happens that I
have had plenty of good sex.

No, no, you didn't have
great sex with Sheldon.

08:23.171 --> 08:24.212
I did too.

No you didn't.

Sheldon's your man,

08:30.553 --> 08:33.013
but humping and pumping is
not Sheldon's strong suit.

08:33.014 --> 08:33.847
It's the name.

08:42.565 --> 08:43.941
I'll have the number three.

08:45.443 --> 08:46.610
I'd like the chef salad, please,

08:46.611 --> 08:48.028
with the oil and vinegar on the side

08:48.029 --> 08:49.821
and the apple pie a la mode.

08:49.822 --> 08:52.741
Chef and apple a la mode.

08:52.742 --> 08:54.618
But I'd like the pie heated

08:54.619 --> 08:56.912
and I don't want the ice cream
on top, I want it on the side

08:56.913 --> 08:59.122

of vanilla if you have it.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.957

cream just whipped cream

out of a can then nothing.

09:03.628 --> 09:04.878

09:04.879 --> 09:06.839

What?

09:15.473 --> 09:16.390
Nothing, nothing.

09:19.227 --> 09:20.560
So, how come you broke up with Sheldon?

09:20.561 --> 09:22.562
How do you know we broke up?

09:22.563 --> 09:23.563
Because if you didn't break up,

09:23.564 --> 09:24.606
you wouldn't be here with me.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.109
You'd be off with Sheldon
the wonder-schlong.

09:28.194 --> 09:31.571
First of all, I am not "with" you,

09:31.572 --> 09:33.698
and second of all, it
is none of your business

09:33.699 --> 09:35.242
why we broke up.

09:35.243 --> 09:36.785
You're right, you're right.

09:36.786 --> 09:37.662
I don't wanna know.

09:41.457 --> 09:42.582
Well if you must know,

09:42.583 --> 09:44.125
it was because he was very jealous

09:44.126 --> 09:46.127
and I had these
days-of-the-week underpants.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.212
(imitating a wrong answer buzzer)

09:47.213 --> 09:49.005
I'm sorry, I need a
judge's ruling on this.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.216
"Days-of-week underpants."

09:51.217 --> 09:52.175
Yes.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.426
They had the days of the week on them

09:53.427 --> 09:55.554
and I thought they were sort of funny.

09:55.555 --> 09:56.930
And then one day, Sheldon says to me,

09:56.931 --> 09:59.307
"You never wear Sunday."

09:59.308 --> 10:00.976
It's all suspicious, "Where was Sunday?

10:00.977 --> 10:02.519
"Where had I left Sunday?"

10:02.520 --> 10:05.188
And I told him and he didn't believe me.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.356
What?

10:06.357 --> 10:08.275
They don't make Sunday.

10:08.276 --> 10:09.068
Why not?

10:09.986 --> 10:10.903
Because of God.

10:13.281 --> 10:15.907
(crickets chirping)

10:15.908 --> 10:18.285
Okay, so 15 percent of my share

10:18.286 --> 10:19.078
is 90.

10:20.997 --> 10:21.789
6.90.

10:26.419 --> 10:27.878
This leaves seven.

10:30.965 --> 10:31.757
What?

10:34.552 --> 10:37.262
Do I have something on my face?

10:37.263 --> 10:39.140
You're a very attractive person.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.435
Thank you.

10:43.436 --> 10:45.895
Amanda never said how
attractive you were.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.607
Well may be she doesn't
think I'm attractive.

10:48.608 --> 10:50.233
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.777
Empirically, you are attractive.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.823
Amanda is my friend.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.408
So?

10:58.409 --> 10:59.909
So, you're going with her.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.453
So?

11:01.454 --> 11:02.997
So you're coming on to me.

11:04.165 --> 11:05.041
No I wasn't.

11:07.168 --> 11:07.960
What?

11:09.420 --> 11:11.004
Can't a man say a woman is attractive

11:11.005 --> 11:12.298
without it being a come-on?

11:13.507 --> 11:14.924
All right, all right.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.636
Let's just say, just for
the sake of argument,

11:17.637 --> 11:19.679
that it was a come-on.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.514
What do you want me to do about it?

11:21.515 --> 11:22.849
I take it back, okay?

11:22.850 --> 11:23.975
I take it back.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.352
You can't take it back.

11:25.353 --> 11:26.353
Why not?

11:26.354 --> 11:28.146
Because it's already out there.

11:28.147 --> 11:30.148
Oh geez, what are we suppose to do?

11:30.149 --> 11:31.941
Call the cops, it's already out there.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.986
Just let it lie.

11:34.987 --> 11:36.237
Okay?

11:36.238 --> 11:37.572
Great, let it lie.

11:37.573 --> 11:38.949
That's my policy.

11:39.909 --> 11:43.119
That's what I always say, "Let it lie."

11:43.120 --> 11:44.913
Wanna spend the night at a motel?

11:44.914 --> 11:45.747
See what I did?

11:45.748 --> 11:47.082
- I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.208
I said I would and then I didn't.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.292
- Harry.
- I went the other way.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.086
- Harry?
- What?

11:51.003 --> 11:53.546
We are just going to be friends, okay?

11:53.547 --> 11:54.381
Great, friends.

11:54.382 --> 11:55.216
It's the best thing.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.595
You realize, of course, that
we can never be friends.

12:00.596 --> 12:01.971
[Sally] Why not?

12:01.972 --> 12:03.473
What I'm saying is,

12:03.474 --> 12:06.351
and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form,

12:06.352 --> 12:08.103
is that men and women can't be friends

12:08.104 --> 12:10.272
because the sex part
always gets in the way.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.192
That's not true.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.027
I have a number of men friends

12:16.028 --> 12:17.529
and there's is no sex involved.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.948
- No you don't.
- Yes I do.

12:19.949 --> 12:21.408
You only think you do.

12:21.409 --> 12:22.867
You're saying I'm
having sex with these men

12:22.868 --> 12:23.743
without my knowledge?

12:23.744 --> 12:27.288
No, what I'm saying is they
all want to have sex with you.

12:27.289 --> 12:31.292
- They do not.
- Do too.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.293
How do you know?

12:32.294 --> 12:34.045
Because no man can
be friends with a woman

12:34.046 --> 12:35.171
that he finds attractive.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.007
He always wants to have sex with her.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.635
So you're saying that
a man can be friends

12:40.636 --> 12:42.637
with a woman he finds unattractive.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.640
No, you pretty much wanna nail 'em too.

12:47.393 --> 12:49.519
What if they don't
wanna have sex with you?

12:49.520 --> 12:50.353
Doesn't matter,

12:50.354 --> 12:51.938
because the sex thing
is already out there,

12:51.939 --> 12:53.565
so the friendship is ultimately doomed

12:53.566 --> 12:55.900
and that is the end of the story.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.485
Well I guess we're not
gonna be friends then.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.820
Guess not.

12:58.821 --> 12:59.613
That's too bad.

13:00.656 --> 13:03.075

14:21.946 --> 14:24.239
Yeah, we were high school sweethearts.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.534
But then after our junior
year, his parents moved away.

14:27.535 --> 14:29.078
But I never forgot her.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.621
He never forgot me.

14:31.622 --> 14:35.375
No, her face was burned on my brain

14:35.376 --> 14:39.087
and it was 34 years later that
I was walking down Broadway

14:39.088 --> 14:41.422
and I saw her come out of Toffenetti's.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.424
And we both looked at each other,

14:43.425 --> 14:47.846
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

14:47.847 --> 14:51.933
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.519

(Sally giggling)

15:29.346 --> 15:32.015
Joe, I thought it was
you, I thought it was you.

15:32.016 --> 15:32.849
Harry Burns.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.350
Harry, Harry how're you doing?

15:34.351 --> 15:35.685
Good, how're you doing?

15:35.686 --> 15:37.020
Fine, I'm doing fine.

15:37.021 --> 15:37.854
Yeah, that's great.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.188
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you

15:39.189 --> 15:40.023
and there it is, it's you!

15:40.024 --> 15:41.733
- Yeah, yeah, it was.
- (laughing)

15:41.734 --> 15:42.859
Are you still with the DA's office?

15:42.860 --> 15:45.111
[Joe] No, I switched to the other side.

15:45.112 --> 15:45.945
What about you?

15:45.946 --> 15:48.406
I work with a small firm,
we do political consulting.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.408
- Oh, yeah.
- It's been great, yeah.

15:50.409 --> 15:51.784
(laughing)

15:51.785 --> 15:53.578
Oh, Harry, this is Sally Albright.

15:53.579 --> 15:54.413
Harry Burns.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.082
Harry and I, we used to, we
lived in the same building.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.252
(laughing)

16:02.046 --> 16:03.212
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch,

16:03.213 --> 16:04.380
it was really good to see you, Joe.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.214
[Joe] You too, Harry.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.008
Bye.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.182
Thank God he couldn't place me.

16:14.183 --> 16:16.601
I drove from college to New
York with him five years ago

16:16.602 --> 16:18.812
and it was the longest night of my life.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.315
What happened?

16:22.316 --> 16:24.275
He made a pass at me and when I said no,

16:24.276 --> 16:26.153
he was going with a girlfriend of mine.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.115
Oh God, I can't remember her name.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.784
Don't get involved with me, Joe,

16:32.785 --> 16:35.286
I am 26 years old and I
can't even remember the name

16:35.287 --> 16:36.746
of the girl I was such good friends with

16:36.747 --> 16:38.624
I wouldn't get involved
with her boyfriend.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.125
So what happened?

16:41.126 --> 16:41.960
When?

16:41.961 --> 16:43.878
When he made a pass
at you and you said no.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.088
Oh, oh.

16:45.089 --> 16:46.674
I said we could just be friends.

16:47.758 --> 16:48.841
And this part I remember,

16:48.842 --> 16:51.720
he said that men and women
could never really be friends.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.473
Do you think that's true?

16:56.558 --> 16:57.976
No.

16:57.977 --> 17:00.229
Do you have any women
friends, just friends?

17:01.522 --> 17:02.314
No.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.526
But I will get one if
it is important to you.

17:07.987 --> 17:10.195
Amanda Reese.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.949
That was her name, thank God.

17:12.866 --> 17:13.742
I will miss you.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.452
I love you.

17:16.704 --> 17:17.496
You do?

17:18.830 --> 17:19.623
Yes.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.291
I love you.

17:47.026 --> 17:48.359
And what would you like to drink?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.736
[Woman] Nothing, thanks.

17:49.737 --> 17:51.237
Do you have any Bloody Marry mix?

17:51.238 --> 17:52.071
[Attendant] Yes.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.448
No, wait.

17:53.449 --> 17:54.615
Here's what I want.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.993
Regular tomato juice, filled
up about three quarters

17:56.994 --> 17:59.579
than add a splash of Bloody
Marry mix, just a splash,

17:59.580 --> 18:01.789
and a little piece of
lime but on the side.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.500
The University of Chicago, right?

18:05.377 --> 18:06.419
Yes.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.088
Did you look this good at
the University of Chicago?

18:09.089 --> 18:09.881
No.

18:09.882 --> 18:10.674
Did we ever?

18:11.717 --> 18:12.801
No, no.

18:14.470 --> 18:17.473
We drove from Chicago to New
York together after graduation.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.599
Would you two like to sit together?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.018
- No.
- Great, thank you.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.568
You were a good friend of.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.154
Amanda's.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.031
I can't believe you
can't remember her name.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.282
What do you mean, I can remember.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.575
Amanda, right, Amanda Rice.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.659
- Reese.
- Reese, right.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.452
That's what I said.

18:39.453 --> 18:40.620
Whatever happened to her?

18:40.621 --> 18:41.537
I have no idea.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.414
You have no idea?

18:43.415 --> 18:44.624
You were really good friends with her.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.001
We didn't make it because
you were such good friends.

18:47.002 --> 18:47.960
You went with her.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.003
And was it worth it?

18:49.004 --> 18:50.546
The sacrifice for a
friend that you don't even

18:50.547 --> 18:51.672
keep in touch with?

18:51.673 --> 18:53.925
Harry, you might not believe this

18:53.926 --> 18:57.429
but I never considered not
sleeping with you a sacrifice.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.847
Fair enough.

18:59.848 --> 19:00.682
Fair enough.

19:04.478 --> 19:05.353
You were gonna be a gymnast.

19:05.354 --> 19:06.270
A journalist.

19:06.271 --> 19:08.231
Right, that's what I said, and?

19:08.232 --> 19:10.483
I am a journalist, I work at the news.

19:10.484 --> 19:12.111
Great and you're with Joe.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.737
Well that's great.

19:14.738 --> 19:15.947
Great.

19:15.948 --> 19:17.658
You're together, what, three weeks?

19:19.535 --> 19:20.618
A month.

19:20.619 --> 19:21.452
How did you know that?

19:21.453 --> 19:22.703
You take someone to the airport,

19:22.704 --> 19:24.539
it's clearly the beginning
of a relationship.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.666
That's why I have never
taken anyone to the airport

19:26.667 --> 19:28.876
at the beginning of a relationship.

19:28.877 --> 19:29.877
Why?

19:29.878 --> 19:31.337
Because eventually things move on

19:31.338 --> 19:32.922
and you don't take someone to the airport,

19:32.923 --> 19:34.590
and I never wanted anyone to say to me,

19:34.591 --> 19:37.136
"How come you never take
me to the airport anymore?"

19:38.470 --> 19:41.180
It's amazing, you look
like a normal person

19:41.181 --> 19:43.391
but actually you're the Angel of Death.

19:43.392 --> 19:44.643
Are you gonna marry him?

19:46.854 --> 19:48.604
We have only known
each other for a month,

19:48.605 --> 19:50.189
and besides, neither one of us is looking

19:50.190 --> 19:51.858
to get married right now.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.734
I'm getting married.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.569
You are?

19:54.570 --> 19:56.028
Mhmm.

19:56.029 --> 19:56.988
You are.

19:56.989 --> 19:57.781
Yeah.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.199
Who is she?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.327
Helen Helson, she's a
lawyer, she's keeping her name.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.495
(laughing)

20:04.496 --> 20:05.955
You're getting married.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.957
- Yeah.
- (laughing)

20:07.958 --> 20:09.208
What's so funny about that?

20:09.209 --> 20:09.960
It's, no.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.212
(laughing)

20:13.213 --> 20:15.464
It's just so optimistic of you, Harry.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.175
Well you'd be amazed
what falling madly in love

20:17.176 --> 20:18.467
can do for you.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.552
Well it's wonderful.

20:19.553 --> 20:22.138
It's nice to see you
embracing life in this manner.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.098
Yeah, plus you know you
just get to a certain point

20:24.099 --> 20:26.475
where you get tired of the whole thing.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.560
What "whole thing?"

20:27.561 --> 20:29.812
The whole life-of-a-single-guy thing.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.606
You meet someone, you have the safe lunch,

20:31.607 --> 20:34.275
you decide you like each other
enough to move on to dinner.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.653
You go dancing, you do
the white-man's over-bite,

20:38.155 --> 20:39.739
go back to her place, you have sex

20:39.740 --> 20:40.615
and the minute you're finished,

20:40.616 --> 20:42.241
you know what goes through your mind?

20:42.242 --> 20:44.076
How long do I have to
lie here and hold her

20:44.077 --> 20:45.995
before I can get up and go home?

20:45.996 --> 20:47.164
Is 30 seconds enough?

20:48.248 --> 20:49.749
That's what you're thinking?

20:49.750 --> 20:51.083
Is that true?

20:51.084 --> 20:52.461
Sure, all men think that.

20:53.754 --> 20:56.005
How long do you want
to be held afterwards?

20:56.006 --> 20:57.298
All night, right?

20:57.299 --> 20:58.299
See that's the problem.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.552
Somewhere between 30 seconds
and all night is your problem.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.887
I don't have a problem.

21:02.888 --> 21:03.680
Yeah you do.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.936
(airplane screeching)

21:19.321 --> 21:20.113
Staying over?

21:21.240 --> 21:22.073
Yes.

21:22.074 --> 21:23.242
Would you like to have dinner?

21:24.368 --> 21:25.618
Just friends.

21:25.619 --> 21:26.619
I thought you didn't believe

21:26.620 --> 21:28.162
men and women could be friends.

21:28.163 --> 21:28.996
When did I say that?

21:28.997 --> 21:29.997
On the ride to New York.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.167
No, no, no, no, I never said that.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.380
Yes, that's right, they can't be friends.

21:37.381 --> 21:39.173
Unless both of them are
involved with other people,

21:39.174 --> 21:40.174
then they can.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.676
This is an amendment to the earlier rule,

21:41.677 --> 21:43.511
if the two people are in relationships,

21:43.512 --> 21:46.098
the pressure of possibility
of involvement is lifted.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.350
That doesn't work either
because what happens then

21:49.351 --> 21:51.102
is the person you're involved
with can't understand

21:51.103 --> 21:51.978
why you need to be friends

21:51.979 --> 21:53.437
with the person you're just friends with.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.022
Like it means something is
missing from their relationship

21:55.023 --> 21:57.024
and "Why do you have to
go outside to get it?"

21:57.025 --> 21:58.651
Then when you say, "No,
no, no, no, it's not true.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.111
"Nothing is missing
from the relationship."

22:00.112 --> 22:01.988
The person you're involved
with then accuses you

22:01.989 --> 22:03.864
of being secretly attracted to the person

22:03.865 --> 22:05.700
you're just friends with,
which we probably are.

22:05.701 --> 22:07.076
I mean, come on, who
the hell are we kidding?

22:07.077 --> 22:07.910
Let's face it.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.370
Which brings us back to the earlier rule

22:09.371 --> 22:10.246
before the amendment,

22:10.247 --> 22:11.914
which is men and women can't be friends,

22:11.915 --> 22:13.291
so where does that leave us?

22:13.292 --> 22:14.583
- Harry?
- What?

22:14.584 --> 22:15.377
Goodbye.

22:16.962 --> 22:17.754
Okay.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.848
I'll just stop walking,
I'll let you go ahead.

22:32.436 --> 22:34.854
We were married 40 years ago.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.106
We were married three
years, we got a divorce.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.733
Then I married Marjorie.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.192
But first you lived with Barbara.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.277
Right, Barbara.

22:41.278 --> 22:44.238
But I didn't marry Barbara,
I married Marjorie.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.698
Then he got a divorce.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.658
Right, then I married Katie.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.076
Another divorce.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.286
Then, a couple of years later,

22:50.287 --> 22:51.954
at Eddie Collecio's funeral,

22:51.955 --> 22:53.664
I ran into her.

22:53.665 --> 22:56.209
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.044
Roberta.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.962
Right, Roberta.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.381
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.968
I remember I snuck over to her and I said.

23:05.886 --> 23:07.470
What did I say?

23:07.471 --> 23:09.180
You said, "What're you doing after?"

23:09.181 --> 23:10.014
Right.

23:10.015 --> 23:12.391
So I ditch Roberta, we go for coffee.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.851
A month later we're married.

23:13.852 --> 23:16.521
35 years, to the day,
after our first marriage.

23:20.650 --> 23:21.484
I went through his pockets, okay?

23:21.485 --> 23:23.778
Marie, why do you go
through his pockets?

23:23.779 --> 23:24.737
You know what I found?

23:24.738 --> 23:25.654
No, what?

23:25.655 --> 23:27.490
They just bought a dinning room table.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.617
He and his wife just went out
and spent 16 hundred dollars

23:29.618 --> 23:30.618
on a dinning room table.

23:30.619 --> 23:31.452
Where?

23:31.453 --> 23:33.621
The point isn't where, Alice.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.873
The point is he's never gonna leave her.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.667
So what else is new, you've
known this for two years.

23:38.668 --> 23:41.128
You're right, you're
right, I know you're right.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.421
Why can't you find someone single?

23:42.422 --> 23:45.257
When I was single I knew
lots of nice single men.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.842
There must be someone.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.427
Sally found someone.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.679
[Marie] Sally got the last good one.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.972
Joe and I broke up.

23:51.973 --> 23:52.807
What?

23:52.808 --> 23:53.641
When?

23:53.642 --> 23:54.475
Monday.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.518
You waited three days to tell us?

23:55.519 --> 23:56.644
Joe's available?

23:56.645 --> 23:57.895
Oh for God sakes, Marie,

23:57.896 --> 23:59.480
don't you have any feelings about this?

23:59.481 --> 24:00.898
She's obviously upset.

24:00.899 --> 24:01.857
I'm not that upset,

24:01.858 --> 24:04.276
we've been growing apart for quite a while

24:04.277 --> 24:05.528
But you guys were a couple,

24:05.529 --> 24:06.737
you had someone to go places with,

24:06.738 --> 24:09.698
you had a date on national holidays.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.826
I said to myself, "You
deserve more than this.

24:11.827 --> 24:13.327
"You're thirty one years old."

24:13.328 --> 24:14.620
And the clock is ticking.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.080
No, the clock doesn't
really start to tick

24:16.081 --> 24:17.790
until you're 36.

24:17.791 --> 24:20.334
God, you're in such great shape.

24:20.335 --> 24:21.919
Well, I've had a few
days to get use to it

24:21.920 --> 24:24.588
and I feel okay.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.133
Good, then you're ready.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.301
Really, Marie.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.595
Well how else do you think you do it?

24:31.596 --> 24:32.972
I've got the perfect guy.

24:32.973 --> 24:35.433
I don't happen to find him
attractive but you might.

24:35.434 --> 24:37.685
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.478
Marie, I'm not ready yet.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.647
But you just said you were over him.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.651
I am over him but I'm
in a mourning period.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.654
Who is it?

24:48.655 --> 24:50.072
Alex Anderson.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.365
(groaning)

24:51.366 --> 24:54.118
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.744
- Sorry.
- (laughing)

24:55.745 --> 24:56.829
God.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.038
All right, wait, here.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.331
Here we go.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.875
Ken Darman.

25:00.876 --> 25:03.085
He's been married for over a year.

25:03.086 --> 25:03.879
Really?

25:05.213 --> 25:06.298
Married.

25:07.591 --> 25:08.716
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

25:08.717 --> 25:09.842
- Look.
- I got one.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.552
There is no point in
my going out with someone

25:11.553 --> 25:14.263
I might really like if I
met him at the right time

25:14.264 --> 25:16.807
but who, right now, has no
chance of being anything to me

25:16.808 --> 25:18.267
but a transitional man.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.978
Okay but don't wait too long.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.230
Remember what happened to David Warsaw?

25:23.231 --> 25:24.565
His wife left him and everyone said

25:24.566 --> 25:27.860
give him some time,
don't move in too fast.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.571
Six months later, he was dead.

25:30.489 --> 25:31.363
What are you saying?

25:31.364 --> 25:32.823
I should get married to someone right away

25:32.824 --> 25:34.408
in case he's about to die?

25:34.409 --> 25:36.994
At least you could say you were married.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.038
I'm saying that the right man for you

25:39.039 --> 25:41.499
might be out there right now,
and if you don't grab him

25:41.500 --> 25:43.042
someone else will and you'll have to spend

25:43.043 --> 25:44.960
the rest of your life
knowing that someone else

25:44.961 --> 25:46.713
is married to your husband.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.135
(yelling)

25:53.136 --> 25:56.181
(football commotion)

25:57.641 --> 26:00.352
(crowd cheering)

26:07.526 --> 26:09.527
When did this happen?

26:09.528 --> 26:11.111
Friday.

26:11.112 --> 26:13.280
Helen comes home from work and she says,

26:13.281 --> 26:15.824
"I don't know if I want
to be married anymore."

26:15.825 --> 26:17.117
Like it's the institution.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.327
You know, like it's nothing personal,

26:18.328 --> 26:21.455
just something she's been
thinking about in a casual way.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.207
I'm calm, I say,

26:23.208 --> 26:24.250
"Why don't we take some
time to think about it,

26:24.251 --> 26:26.210
"you know, don't rush into anything."

26:26.211 --> 26:27.211
Yeah, right.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.463
Next day, she said
she's thought about it,

26:29.464 --> 26:31.382
and she wants a trial separation.

26:31.383 --> 26:34.426
She just wants to try it, she
says, but we can still date.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.011
Like this is supposed to cushion the blow.

26:36.012 --> 26:38.264
I mean, I got married
so I can stop dating.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.808
So I don't see where we can
still date is any big incentive,

26:40.809 --> 26:42.977
since the last thing you
want to do is date your wife,

26:42.978 --> 26:44.478
who's suppose to love you,

26:44.479 --> 26:45.896
which is what I'm saying,
when it occurs to me

26:45.897 --> 26:48.399
that may be she doesn't.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.318
So I say to her, "Don't
you love me anymore?"

26:51.319 --> 26:52.611
You know what she says?

26:52.612 --> 26:54.280
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

26:54.281 --> 26:55.656
Oh, that's harsh.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.491
(crowd cheering)

26:57.492 --> 26:59.034
You don't bounce back
from that right away.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.119
Thanks, Jess.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.787
No, I'm a writer, I know dialogue

27:01.788 --> 27:03.956
and that's particularly harsh.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.749
Then she tells me that
somebody in her office

27:05.750 --> 27:09.044
is going to South America and
she can sub-let his apartment.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.922
I can't believe this,
and the doorbell rings.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.299
"I can sub-let his apartment."

27:13.300 --> 27:14.967
The words are still hanging in the air,

27:14.968 --> 27:16.760
you know, like in a balloon
attached to a mouth.

27:16.761 --> 27:17.678
Like a cartoon.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.470
Right.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.473
So I go to the door and
there were moving men there.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.434
Now I start to get suspicious.

27:23.435 --> 27:25.853
I say, "Helen, when did
you call these movers?"

27:25.854 --> 27:27.438
And she doesn't say anything.

27:27.439 --> 27:28.272
So I asked the movers,

27:28.273 --> 27:30.274
"When did this woman
book you for this gig?"

27:30.275 --> 27:31.275
And they're just standing there.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.943
Three huge guys, one of them was wearing

27:32.944 --> 27:35.571
a t-shirt that says,
"Don't fuck with Mr. Zero."

27:35.572 --> 27:39.366
So I said, "Helen, when did
you make this arrangement?"

27:39.367 --> 27:41.368
She says, "A week ago."

27:41.369 --> 27:44.455
I said, "You've known for a
week and you didn't tell me?"

27:44.456 --> 27:47.374
And she says, "I didn't
want to ruin your birthday."

27:47.375 --> 27:50.085
(crowd cheering)

27:50.086 --> 27:52.630
You're say Mr. Zero knew
you were getting a divorce

27:52.631 --> 27:53.589
a week before you did?

27:53.590 --> 27:54.715
Mr. Zero knew.

27:54.716 --> 27:55.591
I can't believe this.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.468
I haven't told you the bad part yet.

27:57.469 --> 28:00.137
What could be worse
than Mr. Zero knowing?

28:00.138 --> 28:00.930
It's all a lie.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.767
She's in love with somebody else.

28:04.768 --> 28:05.894
Some tax attorney.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.437
She moved in with him.

28:08.438 --> 28:09.564
How did you find out?

28:11.191 --> 28:13.400
I followed her, I stood
outside the building.

28:13.401 --> 28:14.777
So humiliating.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.570
Tell me about it.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.155
And do you know I knew?

28:18.156 --> 28:20.115
I knew the whole time that
even though we were happy

28:20.116 --> 28:21.659
it was just an illusion and that one day

28:21.660 --> 28:23.786
she would kick the shit out of me.

28:23.787 --> 28:26.789
Marriages don't break up
on account of infidelity.

28:26.790 --> 28:29.500
It's just a symptom that
something else is wrong.

28:29.501 --> 28:30.334
Oh really?

28:30.335 --> 28:32.378
Well that symptom is fucking my wife.

28:32.379 --> 28:35.090
(crowd cheering)

28:36.633 --> 28:39.427
So I just happen to see
his American Express bill.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.889
What do you mean you
just "happened" to see it?

28:43.890 --> 28:47.601
Well, he was shaving and
there it was, in his briefcase.

28:47.602 --> 28:48.435
What if he came out

28:48.436 --> 28:50.354
and saw you looking through his briefcase?

28:50.355 --> 28:53.232
You're missing the point,
I'm telling you what I found.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.859
He just spent a hundred and twenty dollars

28:55.860 --> 28:57.696
on a new night gown for his wife.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.949
I don't think he's ever
going to leave her.

29:01.950 --> 29:04.660
No one thinks he's ever gonna leave her.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.705
You're right, you're
right, I know you're right.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.294
(faint city commotion)

29:22.804 --> 29:25.807
Someone is staring at
you in "Personal Growth."

29:29.185 --> 29:30.728
I know him.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.147
You'd like him, he's married.

29:33.523 --> 29:34.898
Who is he?

29:34.899 --> 29:36.985
Harry Burns, he's a
political consultant.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.695
[Marie] He's cute.

29:39.696 --> 29:41.280
[Sally] You think he's cute?

29:41.281 --> 29:43.073
[Marie] How do you know he's married?

29:43.074 --> 29:45.284
'Cause last time I saw
him, he was getting married.

29:45.285 --> 29:46.077
When was that?

29:46.953 --> 29:48.537
Six years ago.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.582
So he might not be married anymore.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.876
Also, he's obnoxious.

29:53.877 --> 29:55.335
This is just like in
the movies, remember?

29:55.336 --> 29:56.962
In "The Lady Vanishes,"
when she says to him,

29:56.963 --> 29:58.046
"You're the most obnoxious
man I ever met--"

29:58.047 --> 29:59.548
"The most contemptible."

29:59.549 --> 30:01.383
Then they fall madly in love.

30:01.384 --> 30:02.968
Also, he never remembers me.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.179
[Harry] Sally Albright.

30:06.765 --> 30:07.890
Hi, Harry.

30:07.891 --> 30:08.932
I thought it was you.

30:08.933 --> 30:10.559
It is.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.352
This is Marie.

30:13.438 --> 30:14.230
Was Marie.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.315
How are you?

30:16.316 --> 30:17.274
Fine.

30:17.275 --> 30:18.650
How's Joe?

30:18.651 --> 30:20.277
Fine.

30:20.278 --> 30:21.237
I hear he's fine.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.740
You're not with Joe anymore?

30:24.616 --> 30:26.116
We just broke up.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.534
Aw.

30:27.535 --> 30:28.828
I'm sorry, that's too bad.

30:30.413 --> 30:31.580
Yeah.

30:31.581 --> 30:32.456
Well, you know.

30:32.457 --> 30:33.290
(chuckling)

30:33.291 --> 30:34.583
Yeah.

30:34.584 --> 30:35.376
So,

30:36.836 --> 30:37.836
what about you?

30:37.837 --> 30:38.962
I'm fine.

30:38.963 --> 30:39.964
How's married life?

30:42.050 --> 30:43.592
Not so good.

30:43.593 --> 30:45.302
I'm getting a divorce.

30:45.303 --> 30:46.554
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:47.555 --> 30:48.598
I'm really sorry.

30:49.766 --> 30:51.476
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

30:52.811 --> 30:54.770
What happened with you guys?

30:54.771 --> 30:56.313
When Joe and I started
seeing each other,

30:56.314 --> 30:57.941
we wanted exactly the same thing.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.193
We wanted to live together but
we didn't want to get married

31:01.194 --> 31:03.320
because every time anyone
we knew got married

31:03.321 --> 31:04.696
it ruined their relationship,

31:04.697 --> 31:06.491
they practically never had sex again.

31:07.408 --> 31:08.659
It's true.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.328
It's one of those secrets
that no one ever tells you.

31:11.329 --> 31:14.248
I would sit around with my
girlfriends who have kids.

31:14.249 --> 31:17.000
Actually, my one girlfriend
who has kids, Alice,

31:17.001 --> 31:18.877
and she would complain
about how she and Garry

31:18.878 --> 31:19.921
never did it anymore.

31:21.339 --> 31:22.589
She didn't even complain about it,

31:22.590 --> 31:23.423
now that I think about it.

31:23.424 --> 31:24.758
She just said it matter-of-factly.

31:24.759 --> 31:26.635
She said, "They were up all night,

31:26.636 --> 31:28.262
"they were both exhausted all the time,

31:28.263 --> 31:30.305
"the kids just took every sexual impulse

31:30.306 --> 31:31.391
"they had out of them."

31:33.935 --> 31:35.644
Joe and I use to talk
about it and we'd say,

31:35.645 --> 31:38.605
"We are so lucky we have
this wonderful relationship,

31:38.606 --> 31:40.649
"we can have sex on the kitchen floor

31:40.650 --> 31:43.110
"and not worry about the kids walking in.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.613
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

31:48.074 --> 31:49.199
And then, one day,

31:49.200 --> 31:51.326
I was taking to Alice's
little girl for the afternoon

31:51.327 --> 31:53.328
because I promised I'd
take her to the circus,

31:53.329 --> 31:56.707
and we were in the cab playing eye-spy.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.085
Eye-spy mailbox, eye-spy lamppost.

32:00.545 --> 32:02.504
And she looked out the window and she saw

32:02.505 --> 32:05.132
this man and this woman
with these two little kids

32:05.133 --> 32:08.594
and the man had one of the
little kids on his shoulders

32:08.595 --> 32:11.514
and she said, "I spy a family."

32:12.932 --> 32:14.475
And I started to cry.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.061
You know I just started crying.

32:19.022 --> 32:20.898
And I went home and I said,

32:20.899 --> 32:21.773
"The thing is Joe,

32:21.774 --> 32:25.319
"we never do fly off to
Rome on a moment's notice."

32:25.320 --> 32:26.487
And the kitchen floor?

32:27.614 --> 32:28.780
Not once.

32:28.781 --> 32:32.576
It's this very cold, hard
Mexican ceramic tile.

32:32.577 --> 32:33.369
Hmmm.

32:34.662 --> 32:36.246
Anyway,

32:36.247 --> 32:38.582
we talked about it for
a long time and I said,

32:38.583 --> 32:39.541
"This is what I want."

32:39.542 --> 32:41.877
And he says, "Well I don't."

32:41.878 --> 32:44.505
And I said, "Well I guess
it's over" and he left.

32:48.092 --> 32:51.262
And the thing is I feel really fine.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.599
I am over him, I mean,
I really am over him.

32:55.475 --> 32:56.433
And that was it for him.

32:56.434 --> 32:58.769
That was the most that he could give.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.563
And every time I think about
it I am more and more convinced

33:01.564 --> 33:02.857
that I did the right thing.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.568
Boy, you sound really healthy.

33:06.569 --> 33:07.362
Yeah.

33:08.613 --> 33:10.113
At least I got the apartment.

33:10.114 --> 33:11.990
That's what everybody says to me too.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.534
But really, what's so hard
about finding an apartment?

33:14.535 --> 33:17.079
What you do is you read
the obituary column.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.872
Yeah, you find out who
died, go to the building

33:18.873 --> 33:20.707
and then you tip the doorman.

33:20.708 --> 33:21.917
What they could do to make it easier

33:21.918 --> 33:24.586
is to combine the obituaries
with the real estate section.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.421
Then you'd have "Mr. Klein died today,

33:26.422 --> 33:28.173
"leaving a wife, two children,

33:28.174 --> 33:29.716
"and a spacious three bedroom apartment

33:29.717 --> 33:31.176
"with a wood burning fireplace."

33:31.177 --> 33:33.011
(laughing)

33:33.012 --> 33:35.764
(somber piano music)

33:35.765 --> 33:36.807
You know, the first time we met,

33:36.808 --> 33:38.809
I really didn't like you that much.

33:38.810 --> 33:39.768
I didn't like you.

33:39.769 --> 33:40.644
Yeah you did.

33:40.645 --> 33:41.478
You were just so uptight then.

33:41.479 --> 33:42.647
You're much softer now.

33:44.315 --> 33:45.857
You know, I hate that kind of remark.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.485
It sounds like a compliment
but really, it's an insult.

33:48.486 --> 33:50.779
Okay, you're still as hard as nails.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.114
I just didn't want to sleep with you

33:52.115 --> 33:54.282
and you had to write it
off as a character flaw

33:54.283 --> 33:55.826
instead of dealing with the possibility

33:55.827 --> 33:57.870
that it might have
something to do with you.

33:59.956 --> 34:02.333
What's the statute of
limitation on apologies?

34:04.627 --> 34:05.460
Ten years.

34:05.461 --> 34:07.422
Oh, I can just get it in under the wire.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.592
(pleasant piano music)

34:13.219 --> 34:16.346
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

34:16.347 --> 34:17.806
Are we becoming friends now?

34:20.226 --> 34:21.018
Well,

34:23.187 --> 34:23.980
yeah.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.565
Great.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.985
A woman friend.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.695
You know, you may be the
first attractive woman

34:31.696 --> 34:34.157
I have not wanted to sleep
with in my entire life.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.743
[Sally] That's wonderful, Harry.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.786
We were both born in the same hospital.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.080
In 1921.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.708
- Seven days apart.
- In the same hospital.

34:44.708 --> 34:45.958
We both grew up one block

34:45.960 --> 34:47.753
away from each other.
- We both lived in tenements.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.087
On the lower East Side.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.839
On Delancey Street.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.466
My family moved to the Bronx

34:52.467 --> 34:54.051
when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

34:54.052 --> 34:55.552
Hers moved when she was eleven.

34:55.553 --> 34:57.220
I lived on a hundred
and eighty third Street.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.639
For six years she
worked on the 15 floor--

34:59.640 --> 35:01.183
I worked for a very
prominent neurologist.

35:01.184 --> 35:04.936
As a nurse where I had
a practice on the 14 floor

35:04.937 --> 35:06.313
of the very same building.

35:06.314 --> 35:07.439
We never met.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.273
Never met.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.941
Can you imagine that?

35:09.942 --> 35:11.443
You know where we met?

35:11.444 --> 35:12.277
In an elevator.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.528
I was visiting family.

35:13.529 --> 35:15.489
In the ambassador hotel
in Chicago, Illinois.

35:15.490 --> 35:17.824
He was on the third
floor, I was on the 12th.

35:17.825 --> 35:21.661
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

35:21.662 --> 35:22.830
Nine extra floors.

35:26.375 --> 35:29.878
(somber piano music)

35:29.879 --> 35:32.507
(phone ringing)

35:34.425 --> 35:35.675
[Sally Voiceover] Hello?

35:35.676 --> 35:37.094
[Harry Voiceover] You sleeping?

35:37.095 --> 35:38.804
[Sally Voiceover] No, I
was watching "Casablanca."

35:38.805 --> 35:39.930
[Harry Voiceover] Channel, please.

35:39.931 --> 35:40.764
[Sally Voiceover] 11.

35:40.765 --> 35:41.807
[Harry Voiceover] Thank you.

35:41.808 --> 35:42.849
Got it.

35:42.850 --> 35:45.393
Now you're telling me you will
be happier with Victor Laszlo

35:45.394 --> 35:46.978
than with Humphrey Bogart?

35:46.979 --> 35:48.146
[Sally Voiceover] When did I say that?

35:48.147 --> 35:50.232
[Harry Voiceover] When
we drove to New York.

35:50.233 --> 35:51.233
[Sally Voiceover] I never said that.

35:51.234 --> 35:52.442
I would have never have said that.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.320
[Harry Voiceover] All
right, fine, have it your way.

35:56.614 --> 35:57.948
Have you been sleeping?

35:57.949 --> 35:58.782
[Sally Voiceover] Why?

35:58.783 --> 36:01.034
[Harry Voiceover] Because
I haven't been sleeping.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.120
I really miss Helen.

36:04.122 --> 36:05.831
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

36:05.832 --> 36:07.290
Last night I was up at four in the morning

36:07.291 --> 36:09.584
watching "Leave it to Beaver" in Spanish.

36:09.585 --> 36:13.630
(Harry speaking Spanish)

36:13.631 --> 36:14.923
I'm not well.

36:14.924 --> 36:17.008
[Sally Voiceover] Well I
went to bed at 7:30 last night.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.844
I haven't don't that
since the third grade.

36:18.845 --> 36:19.719
[Harry Voiceover] Well
that's the good thing

36:19.720 --> 36:22.222
about depression, you get your rest.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.598
[Sally Voiceover] I'm not depressed.

36:23.599 --> 36:25.642
[Harry Voiceover] Okay, fine.

36:25.643 --> 36:28.228
Do you still sleep on
the same side of the bed?

36:28.229 --> 36:29.062
[Sally Voiceover] I did for awhile

36:29.063 --> 36:31.189
but now I'm pretty much
using the whole bed.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.941
[Harry Voiceover] God, that's great.

36:32.942 --> 36:35.153
I feel weird when just
my leg wanders over.

36:36.863 --> 36:37.655
I miss her.

36:39.073 --> 36:40.949
[Sally Voiceover] I don't
miss him, I really don't.

36:40.950 --> 36:42.742
[Harry Voiceover] Not even a little?

36:42.743 --> 36:44.995
[Sally Voiceover] You know what I miss?

36:44.996 --> 36:46.873
I miss the idea of him.

36:48.916 --> 36:52.210
[Harry Voiceover] Maybe I
only miss the idea of Helen.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.713
No, I miss the whole Helen.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.051
[Sally Voiceover] Last scene.

37:00.052 --> 37:03.264
(television commotion)

37:06.642 --> 37:08.143
[Harry] Oh, Ingrid Bergman,

37:08.144 --> 37:09.853
now she's low maintenance.

37:09.854 --> 37:11.021
[Sally] Low maintenance?

37:11.022 --> 37:12.480
[Harry] There are two kinds of women.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.691
High maintenance and low maintenance.

37:14.692 --> 37:17.027
And Ingrid Bergman is low maintenance?

37:17.028 --> 37:19.029
An LM, definitely.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.322
Which one am I?

37:20.323 --> 37:21.156
You're the worst kind.

37:21.157 --> 37:21.990
You're high maintenance

37:21.991 --> 37:24.117
but you think you're low maintenance.

37:24.118 --> 37:24.951
I don't see that.

37:24.952 --> 37:26.369
You don't see that?

37:26.370 --> 37:27.996
"Waiter, I'll begin with a house salad,

37:27.997 --> 37:29.456
"but I don't want the regular dressing.

37:29.457 --> 37:31.208
"I'll have the balsamic vinegar and oil,

37:31.209 --> 37:32.042
"but on the side.

37:32.043 --> 37:33.543
"And then the salmon
with the mustard sauce,

37:33.544 --> 37:35.712
"but I want the mustard
sauce on the side."

37:35.713 --> 37:37.756
"On the side" is a very big thing for you.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.758
Well I just want it the way I want it.

37:39.759 --> 37:41.052
I know, high maintenance.

37:41.969 --> 37:45.055
About 10 thousand Francs
should pay our expenses.

37:45.056 --> 37:46.431
[Rick] Our expenses?

37:46.432 --> 37:47.307
[Louie] Mhmm.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.768
[Rick] Louie, I think
this is the beginning

37:49.769 --> 37:51.145
of a beautiful friendship.

37:52.897 --> 37:55.066
[Harry] Best last line of a movie ever.

37:56.692 --> 37:57.485
Hmmmm.

37:59.362 --> 38:01.446
I'm definitely coming
down with something.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.949
Probably a twenty four hour
tumor, they're going around.

38:03.950 --> 38:05.075
You don't have a tumor.

38:05.076 --> 38:05.909
How do you know?

38:05.910 --> 38:08.411
If you're so worried, go see a doctor.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.373
No, they'll just tell me it's nothing.

38:11.290 --> 38:12.582
Will you be able to sleep?

38:12.583 --> 38:13.541
If not, I'll be okay.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.543
What'll you do?

38:15.544 --> 38:17.337
I'll stay up and moan.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.464
Maybe I should practice now.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.592
(moaning)

38:25.596 --> 38:27.180
Goodnight, Harry.

38:27.181 --> 38:28.306
(moaning)

38:28.307 --> 38:29.100
Goodnight.

38:31.102 --> 38:34.813
(television commotion)

38:34.814 --> 38:37.525
(Harry groaning)

39:04.802 --> 39:06.052
(pleasant music)

39:06.053 --> 39:07.387
I had my dream again,

39:07.388 --> 39:10.265
where I'm making love and the
Olympic judges are watching.

39:10.266 --> 39:13.018
I've nailed the compulsories
so this is it, the finals.

39:13.019 --> 39:14.352
I got a nine eight from the Canadian,

39:14.353 --> 39:16.771
a perfect ten from the American,

39:16.772 --> 39:18.815
and my mother, disguised
as a East German judge,

39:18.816 --> 39:20.442
gave me a five six.

39:20.443 --> 39:21.694
Must've been the dismount.

39:23.154 --> 39:24.237
[Sally] Well basically it's the same one

39:24.238 --> 39:26.239
I've been having since I was 12.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.073
What happens?

39:27.074 --> 39:29.117
It's too embarrassing.

39:29.118 --> 39:30.285
Don't tell me.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.786
Okay, there's this guy.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.288
What's he look like?

39:33.289 --> 39:34.914
I don't know, he's just kinda faceless.

39:34.915 --> 39:36.959
A faceless guy, okay, then what?

39:38.794 --> 39:41.004
He rips off my clothes.

39:41.005 --> 39:43.048
Then what happens?

39:43.049 --> 39:44.008
That's it.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.260
That's it?

39:47.261 --> 39:48.887
A faceless guy rips off your clothes

39:48.888 --> 39:50.430
and that's the sex
fantasies you've been having

39:50.431 --> 39:51.848
since you were 12.

39:51.849 --> 39:53.391
Exactly the same.

39:53.392 --> 39:56.102
Well sometimes I vary it a little.

39:56.103 --> 39:57.020
Which part?

39:57.021 --> 39:57.938
What I'm wearing.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.650
(pleasant music)

40:03.778 --> 40:04.903
What?

40:04.904 --> 40:05.696
Nothing.

40:08.115 --> 40:11.534
I have decided that
for the rest of the day

40:11.535 --> 40:14.537
we are going to talk like this.

40:14.538 --> 40:15.372
[Sally] Like this?

40:15.373 --> 40:18.083
[Harry] No. Please, to repeat after me.

40:18.084 --> 40:18.917
Pepper.

40:18.918 --> 40:19.751
[Sally] Pepper.

40:19.752 --> 40:20.585
[Harry] Pepper.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.253
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

40:22.254 --> 40:26.341
Waiter, there is too much
pepper on my paprikash.

40:26.342 --> 40:27.175
(laughing)

40:27.176 --> 40:28.927
"Waiter, there is too much pepper."

40:28.928 --> 40:29.969
On my paprikash.

40:29.970 --> 40:30.887
"On my paprikash."

40:30.888 --> 40:34.808
But I would be proud to
partake of your pecan pie.

40:34.809 --> 40:35.642
(laughing)

40:35.643 --> 40:36.643
Oh no.

40:36.644 --> 40:37.477
But I would be proud.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.812
"But I would be proud."

40:38.813 --> 40:39.896
- To partake.
- "To partake"

40:39.897 --> 40:41.981
Of your pecan pie.

40:41.982 --> 40:44.234
- "Of your pecan pie."
- Pecan pie.

40:44.235 --> 40:46.277
- "Pecan pie."
- Pecan pie.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.737
"Pecan pie."

40:47.738 --> 40:48.780
(laughing)

40:48.781 --> 40:51.032
Would you like to go to
the movies with me tonight?

40:51.033 --> 40:52.659
"Would you like to go, what?"

40:52.660 --> 40:53.493
Not to repeat.

40:53.494 --> 40:54.911
Please, to answer.

40:54.912 --> 40:58.540
Would you like to go to
the movies with me tonight?

40:58.541 --> 41:00.750
Oh, oh.

41:00.751 --> 41:02.836
Oh, I'd love to Harry but I can't.

41:02.837 --> 41:06.047
What do you have, a hot date?

41:06.048 --> 41:07.966
Well, yeah, yeah.

41:07.967 --> 41:08.800
Really?

41:08.801 --> 41:09.592
Yeah.

41:09.593 --> 41:11.886
I was gonna tell you
about it but I don't know,

41:11.887 --> 41:13.012
I felt strange about it.

41:13.013 --> 41:13.847
Why?

41:13.848 --> 41:15.140
Well because we've been
spending so much time together.

41:15.141 --> 41:18.309
Oh, I think it's great
that you have a date.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.144
You do?

41:19.145 --> 41:19.937
Yeah.

41:27.111 --> 41:28.528
Is that what you're gonna wear?

41:28.529 --> 41:29.946
Yeah.

41:29.947 --> 41:32.115
Well, I don't know.

41:32.116 --> 41:33.616
Why?

41:33.617 --> 41:35.326
I think you should wear skirts more.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.370
You look really good in skirts.

41:37.371 --> 41:38.205
- I do?
- Yeah.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.042
You know, I have a
theory that Hieroglyphics

41:43.043 --> 41:44.502
are really an ancient comic strip

41:44.503 --> 41:46.713
about a character named Sphinxie.

41:46.714 --> 41:48.798
You know, Harry, I think
you should get out there too.

41:48.799 --> 41:50.383
Oh, I'm not ready.

41:50.384 --> 41:51.718
You should.

41:51.719 --> 41:54.095
I would not be good
for anybody right now.

41:54.096 --> 41:54.889
It's time.

41:56.182 --> 41:59.434
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

41:59.435 --> 42:01.061
See, no, it has to go this way.

42:02.688 --> 42:05.648
The first date back is
always the toughest, Harry.

42:05.649 --> 42:06.901
You only had one date.

42:07.818 --> 42:10.028
How do you know it's not gonna get worse?

42:10.029 --> 42:12.238
How much worse can it
get than finishing dinner,

42:12.239 --> 42:14.491
having him reaching over,
pull a hair out of my head

42:14.492 --> 42:16.910
and starts flossing with it at the table?

42:16.911 --> 42:19.871
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

42:19.872 --> 42:21.706
It started out fine.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.625
She's a very nice person.

42:23.626 --> 42:24.751
And we're sitting and we're talking

42:24.752 --> 42:27.086
in this Ethiopian restaurant
that she wanted to go to.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.796
And I was making jokes, you know like,

42:28.797 --> 42:30.882
"Hey, I didn't know that
they had food in Ethiopia?

42:30.883 --> 42:32.008
"This will be a quick meal.

42:32.009 --> 42:34.093
"I'll order two empty
plates and we can leave."

42:34.094 --> 42:34.928
(laughing)

42:34.929 --> 42:37.263
Yeah, nothing from
her, not even a smile.

42:37.264 --> 42:39.349
So I down shift into small talk,

42:39.350 --> 42:40.433
and I asked her where she went to school

42:40.434 --> 42:42.268
and she says Michigan State.

42:42.269 --> 42:44.187
And this reminds me of Helen.

42:44.188 --> 42:46.439
All of a sudden, I'm in
the middle of this mess

42:46.440 --> 42:48.816
of an anxiety attack, my
heart's beating like a wild man

42:48.817 --> 42:50.610
and I start sweating like a pig.

42:50.611 --> 42:51.819
Helen went to Michigan State?

42:51.820 --> 42:53.530
No, she went to Northwestern.

42:53.531 --> 42:55.074
But they're both Big 10 schools.

42:56.033 --> 42:58.743
I got so upset, I had
to leave the restaurant.

42:58.744 --> 43:01.204
(Sally sighing)

43:01.205 --> 43:03.665
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

43:03.666 --> 43:06.000
It might be months before
we're actually able to enjoy

43:06.001 --> 43:08.044
going out with someone new.

43:08.045 --> 43:08.962
Yeah.

43:08.963 --> 43:10.046
And maybe longer

43:10.047 --> 43:12.507
before we're actually able to
go to bed with someone new.

43:12.508 --> 43:16.427
Oh, I went to bed with her.

43:16.428 --> 43:17.554
You went to bed with her?

43:17.555 --> 43:18.347
Sure.

43:20.099 --> 43:21.224
Huh.

43:21.225 --> 43:24.186
(machinery buzzing)

43:25.229 --> 43:27.021
[Jess] I don't understand
this relationship.

43:27.022 --> 43:28.189
What do you mean?

43:28.190 --> 43:29.107
You enjoy being with her?

43:29.108 --> 43:29.983
Yeah.

43:29.984 --> 43:31.109
You find her attractive?

43:31.110 --> 43:32.151
Yeah.

43:32.152 --> 43:33.111
And you're not sleeping with her.

43:33.112 --> 43:34.279
No.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.906
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

43:36.907 --> 43:38.658
Why can't you give me credit for this?

43:38.659 --> 43:40.410
This is a big thing for me.

43:40.411 --> 43:41.995
I never had a relationship with a woman

43:41.996 --> 43:43.079
that didn't involve sex.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.122
I feel like I'm growing.

43:44.123 --> 43:46.165
[Kid] Are you finished?

43:46.166 --> 43:47.917
Hey, I got a whole stack of
quarters and I was here first.

43:47.918 --> 43:50.379
- Were not!
- Was too!

43:51.297 --> 43:52.505
Big jerk.

43:52.506 --> 43:53.965
Little creep.

43:53.966 --> 43:54.799
Where was I?

43:54.800 --> 43:56.092
You were growing.

43:56.093 --> 43:57.719
Yeah.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.429
It's very freeing.

43:59.430 --> 44:00.681
I can say anything to her.

44:01.599 --> 44:03.057
Are you saying you can say things to her

44:03.058 --> 44:04.018
you can't say to me?

44:04.935 --> 44:06.227
No, it's just different.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.854
It's a whole different perspective.

44:07.855 --> 44:09.981
I get the women's point of view on things.

44:09.982 --> 44:11.858
She tells me about the
men that she goes out with

44:11.859 --> 44:13.901
and I can talk to her
about the women that I see.

44:13.902 --> 44:15.111
You tell her about other women.

44:15.112 --> 44:16.154
Yeah.

44:16.155 --> 44:16.988
Like the other night.

44:16.989 --> 44:19.949
I made love to this woman,
and it was so incredible,

44:19.950 --> 44:21.659
I took her to a place that wasn't human,

44:21.660 --> 44:22.786
she actually meowed.

44:23.787 --> 44:25.121
You made a woman meow?

44:25.122 --> 44:26.456
Yeah, that's the point.

44:26.457 --> 44:28.458
I can say these things to her.

44:28.459 --> 44:30.418
And the great thing
is, I don't have to lie

44:30.419 --> 44:31.628
because I'm not always thinking about

44:31.629 --> 44:32.920
how to get her into bed.

44:32.921 --> 44:35.048
I can just be myself.

44:35.049 --> 44:36.342
You made a woman meow?

44:38.469 --> 44:39.385
[Sally] So what do
you do with these women?

44:39.386 --> 44:41.346
You just get up out of bed and leave?

44:41.347 --> 44:42.388
[Harry] Sure.

44:42.389 --> 44:43.806
Well explain to me how you do it.

44:43.807 --> 44:44.849
What do you say?

44:44.850 --> 44:46.559
Just say I have an early
meeting, early haircut,

44:46.560 --> 44:47.518
early squash game.

44:47.519 --> 44:48.603
You don't play squash.

44:48.604 --> 44:50.314
They don't know that, they just met me.

44:52.066 --> 44:52.899
That's disgusting.

44:52.900 --> 44:53.942
I know, I feel terrible.

44:54.943 --> 44:57.487
You know, I'm so glad I
never got involved with you.

44:57.488 --> 44:59.072
I just would've ended being some woman

44:59.073 --> 45:00.323
you had to get up out of bed and leave

45:00.324 --> 45:03.076
at three o'clock in the morning
and go clean your andirons

45:03.077 --> 45:04.786
and you don't even have a fireplace,

45:04.787 --> 45:06.371
not that I would know this.

45:06.372 --> 45:07.538
Why are you getting so upset?

45:07.539 --> 45:08.790
This is not about you.

45:08.791 --> 45:09.916
Yes it is.

45:09.917 --> 45:13.127
You are a human affront to
all women and I am a woman.

45:13.128 --> 45:13.961
Hey, I don't feel great about this

45:13.962 --> 45:16.214
but I don't hear anyone complaining.

45:16.215 --> 45:19.008
Of course not, you're
out the door too fast.

45:19.009 --> 45:21.344
I think they have an okay time.

45:21.345 --> 45:23.179
How do you know?

45:23.180 --> 45:25.473
What do you mean how do I know? I know.

45:25.474 --> 45:27.058
Because they?

45:27.059 --> 45:28.519
Yes, because they.

45:30.020 --> 45:32.188
How do you know that they're really?

45:32.189 --> 45:35.525
What are you saying,
that they fake orgasm?

45:35.526 --> 45:36.859
It's possible.

45:36.860 --> 45:37.944
Get outta here.

45:37.945 --> 45:38.778
Why?

45:38.779 --> 45:41.489
Most women, at one time
or another, have faked it.

45:41.490 --> 45:43.116
Well they haven't faked it with me.

45:43.117 --> 45:43.992
How do you know?

45:45.619 --> 45:46.995
Because I know.

45:48.831 --> 45:50.331
Oh.

45:50.332 --> 45:52.208
Right, that's right.

45:52.209 --> 45:54.669
I forgot, you're a man.

45:54.670 --> 45:55.795
What does that supposed to me?

45:55.796 --> 45:56.796
Nothing.

45:56.797 --> 45:58.756
It's just that all men are
sure it never happened to them

45:58.757 --> 46:00.216
and that most women,
at one time or another,

46:00.217 --> 46:01.844
have done it, so you do the math.

46:03.011 --> 46:05.722
You don't think that I
could tell the difference?

46:05.723 --> 46:06.597
No.

46:06.598 --> 46:08.058
Get out of here.

46:14.940 --> 46:17.525
Oh.

46:17.526 --> 46:18.318
Oh.

46:20.404 --> 46:21.196
Ooh.

46:23.031 --> 46:23.824
Are you okay?

46:24.867 --> 46:25.659
Oh.

46:28.579 --> 46:30.164
Oh, God.

46:31.415 --> 46:33.333
Ooh, oh God.

46:34.293 --> 46:35.127
Oh.

46:36.462 --> 46:37.254
Ah.

46:38.589 --> 46:40.798
Oh.

46:40.799 --> 46:43.509
Oh, God.

46:43.510 --> 46:44.595
Oh yeah, right there.

46:45.512 --> 46:47.805
(gasping)

46:47.806 --> 46:49.098
Oh.

46:49.099 --> 46:50.516
Ah.

46:50.517 --> 46:51.893
Oh.

46:51.894 --> 46:53.394
Oh, God.

46:53.395 --> 46:54.188
Oh, yes!

46:55.147 --> 46:55.939
Yes! Yes!

46:57.191 --> 47:00.067
Yes! Yes!

47:00.068 --> 47:02.278
(gasping)

47:02.279 --> 47:03.739
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

47:05.866 --> 47:07.074
Oh!

47:07.075 --> 47:10.203

Oh, oh.

Oh, God.

47:18.670 --> 47:19.463
Oh.

I'll have what she's having.

Well, he was the head
counselor and the boys' camp

50:31.113 --> 50:34.031
and I was the head counselor
at the girls' camp,

50:34.032 --> 50:35.783
and they had a social one night,

50:35.784 --> 50:37.994
and he walked across the room.

50:37.995 --> 50:41.080
I thought he was coming to
talk to my friend, Maxine,

50:41.081 --> 50:44.084
'cause people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

50:45.043 --> 50:48.212
But he was coming to
talk to me, and he said--

50:48.213 --> 50:51.132
I'm Ben Small of the
Coney Island Smalls.

50:51.133 --> 50:52.800
At that moment I knew.

50:52.801 --> 50:54.928
I knew the way you know
about a good melon.

50:57.639 --> 51:00.516
You sent flowers to yourself.

51:00.517 --> 51:02.768
60 dollars I spent on this big stupid

51:02.769 --> 51:04.478
arrangement of flowers and I wrote a card

51:04.479 --> 51:05.855
that I planned to leave on the front table

51:05.856 --> 51:08.399
where Arthur would just happen to see it.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.317
What did the card say?

51:10.318 --> 51:13.696
"Please say yes, love, Johnathon."

51:13.697 --> 51:14.613
Did it work?

51:14.614 --> 51:15.990
He never even came over.

51:15.991 --> 51:17.283
He forgot this charity thing

51:17.284 --> 51:18.868
that his wife was a chairman of.

51:18.869 --> 51:20.327
He's never going to leave her.

51:20.328 --> 51:21.328
Of course he isn't.

51:21.329 --> 51:23.372
You're right, you're
right, I knew you're right.

51:23.373 --> 51:24.874
Where is this place?

51:24.875 --> 51:26.625
Somewhere on the next block.

51:26.626 --> 51:27.626
(groaning)

51:27.627 --> 51:29.462
I can't believe I'm doing this.

51:29.463 --> 51:31.672
Look, Harry is one of my best friends

51:31.673 --> 51:33.174
and you are one of my best friends

51:33.175 --> 51:34.925
and if by some chance you two hit it off,

51:34.926 --> 51:37.762
then we could all still be
friends instead of drifting apart

51:37.763 --> 51:39.388
the way you do when you
get involved with someone

51:39.389 --> 51:40.514
who doesn't know your friends.

51:40.515 --> 51:41.766
You and I haven't drifted apart

51:41.767 --> 51:43.226
since I started seeing Arthur.

51:44.936 --> 51:47.271
If Arthur ever left his wife

51:47.272 --> 51:48.606
and I actually met him,

51:48.607 --> 51:51.276
I am sure that you and
I would drift apart.

51:52.235 --> 51:54.528
He's never gonna leave her.

51:54.529 --> 51:55.530
Of course he isn't.

51:56.698 --> 51:58.949
You're right, you're
right, I know you're right.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.451
I don't know about this.

52:00.452 --> 52:01.619
It's just a dinner.

52:01.620 --> 52:03.204
You know, I've finally gone
to a new place in my life

52:03.205 --> 52:04.830
where I'm comfortable with the fact

52:04.831 --> 52:06.999
that it's just me and my work.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.584
If she's so great, why
aren't you taking her out?

52:08.585 --> 52:10.127
How many times do I have to tell you?

52:10.128 --> 52:11.128
We're just friends.

52:11.129 --> 52:12.379
So you're saying she's
not that attractive.

52:12.380 --> 52:14.006
No, I told you she is attractive.

52:14.007 --> 52:15.758
Yeah but you also said
she has a good personality.

52:15.759 --> 52:17.177
She has a good personality.

52:20.263 --> 52:21.388
What?

52:21.389 --> 52:23.140
When someone's not that attractive,

52:23.141 --> 52:26.393
they're always described as
having a good personality.

52:26.394 --> 52:28.270
Look, if you would ask me,
"What does she look like?"

52:28.271 --> 52:30.147
and I said, "She has a good personality."

52:30.148 --> 52:31.690
That means she's not attractive.

52:31.691 --> 52:33.150
But just because I happened to mention

52:33.151 --> 52:35.694
that she has a good personality,
she could be either.

52:35.695 --> 52:37.488
She could be attractive
with a good personality,

52:37.489 --> 52:39.532
or not attractive with a good personality.

52:39.533 --> 52:40.658
So which one is she?

52:40.659 --> 52:41.659
Attractive.

52:41.660 --> 52:43.036
But not beautiful, right?

52:46.665 --> 52:48.499
It's like, whenever
I read Jimmy Breslin,

52:48.500 --> 52:49.751
it's as if he's leaving

52:51.211 --> 52:54.755
a wake-up call for the
City of New York, you know?

52:54.756 --> 52:56.298
What do you mean by a wake-up call?

52:56.299 --> 52:57.259
Well, he's saying.

53:01.972 --> 53:05.474
Would I have seen any of your windows?

53:05.475 --> 53:08.853
A couple of weeks ago, I
did a thing with hostages.

53:08.854 --> 53:09.937
People in blindfolds?

53:09.938 --> 53:11.397
Yeah.

53:11.398 --> 53:12.899
I thought it was like late 80s.

53:14.943 --> 53:16.402
It's interesting.

53:16.403 --> 53:19.446
Let's just say I'm really
not a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

53:19.447 --> 53:21.407
Well, he's the reason I become a writer

53:21.408 --> 53:23.160
but that's not important.

53:36.882 --> 53:38.257
Harry?

53:38.258 --> 53:40.509
You and Marie are both from New Jersey.

53:40.510 --> 53:41.343
Really?

53:41.344 --> 53:42.178
Where are you from?

53:42.179 --> 53:43.137
South Orange.

53:43.138 --> 53:44.096
Haddonfield.

53:44.097 --> 53:45.140
Oh.

53:51.771 --> 53:53.772
So what're we gonna order?

53:53.773 --> 53:56.192
Well, I'm going to start
with the grilled riddichio.

53:56.193 --> 53:57.776
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.

53:57.777 --> 53:59.653
Not only does she always pick
the best thing in the menu

53:59.654 --> 54:01.697
but she orders it in a way that the chef

54:01.698 --> 54:03.282
didn't even know how good it could be.

54:03.283 --> 54:05.326
I think restaurants
have become too important.

54:05.327 --> 54:06.660
I agree.

54:06.661 --> 54:08.120
Restaurants are to people in the 80s

54:08.121 --> 54:10.165
what theatre was to people in the 60s.

54:11.041 --> 54:12.375
I read that in magazine.

54:13.627 --> 54:14.419
I wrote that.

54:15.795 --> 54:16.629
Get out of here.

54:16.630 --> 54:18.714
No, I did, I wrote that.

54:18.715 --> 54:21.342
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine in my life.

54:21.343 --> 54:23.385
That's amazing, don't
you think that's amazing?

54:23.386 --> 54:24.429
And you wrote it?

54:25.764 --> 54:28.349
I also wrote "Pesto is
the quiche of the 80s."

54:28.350 --> 54:30.267
Get over yourself.

54:30.268 --> 54:31.602
I did.

54:31.603 --> 54:32.895
Where did I read that?

54:32.896 --> 54:33.979
New York Magazine.

54:33.980 --> 54:36.523
Sally writes for New York Magazine.

54:36.524 --> 54:39.235
You know that piece
had a real impact on me.

54:39.236 --> 54:40.986
I don't know that much about writing but--

54:40.987 --> 54:43.197
It spoke to you and that pleases me.

54:43.198 --> 54:46.116
[Marie] You have to
admire people who can be

54:46.117 --> 54:47.284
that articulate.

54:47.285 --> 54:50.705
[Jess] Nobody has ever
quoted me back to me before.

55:00.298 --> 55:03.969
Oh, I've been looking
for a red suede pump.

55:06.096 --> 55:07.347
What do you think of Jess?

55:09.349 --> 55:10.474
Well.

55:10.475 --> 55:12.269
Do you think you could go out with him?

55:13.645 --> 55:14.478
I don't know.

55:14.479 --> 55:16.648
Because I feel really
comfortable with him.

55:17.565 --> 55:19.316
You wanna go out with Jess.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.943
If it would be all right with you.

55:20.944 --> 55:21.736
Sure, sure.

55:22.862 --> 55:24.029
I'm just worried about Harry.

55:24.030 --> 55:25.322
He's very sensitive,

55:25.323 --> 55:26.657
he's going through a rough period

55:26.658 --> 55:29.326
and I just don't want you
to reject him right now.

55:29.327 --> 55:31.787
I won't, I totally understand.

55:31.788 --> 55:33.038
If you don't think
you're going to call Marie,

55:33.039 --> 55:35.291
do you mind if I call her?

55:35.292 --> 55:36.917
- No, no.
- Good, good, good.

55:36.918 --> 55:38.919
But for tonight, you shouldn't.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.754
I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.

55:40.755 --> 55:42.464
I mean, you can call Marie, it's fine.

55:42.465 --> 55:44.383
But just wait for a week or so, you know?

55:44.384 --> 55:45.467
Don't make any moves tonight.

55:45.468 --> 55:46.468
Fine, no problem.

55:46.469 --> 55:48.305
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

55:49.848 --> 55:52.224
Well, I don't really feel
much like walking anymore.

55:52.225 --> 55:53.559
I think I'll get a cab.

55:53.560 --> 55:54.393
I'll go with you.

55:54.394 --> 55:55.227
Great!

55:55.228 --> 55:56.021
Taxi!

56:08.283 --> 56:10.701
A man came to me and said,

56:10.702 --> 56:13.871
"I found nice girl for you.

56:13.872 --> 56:17.459
"She lives in the next village,

56:18.376 --> 56:21.212
"and she is ready for marriage."

56:22.797 --> 56:25.967
We were not suppose to
meet until the wedding

56:27.177 --> 56:29.386
but I wanted to make sure.

56:29.387 --> 56:31.722
So I sneak into her village,

56:31.723 --> 56:33.849
hid behind a tree,

56:33.850 --> 56:36.353
watch her washing the clothes.

56:37.479 --> 56:41.482
I think if I don't like the way she looks,

56:41.483 --> 56:43.484
I don't marry her.

56:43.485 --> 56:45.320
But she look very nice to me.

56:46.279 --> 56:48.990
So I said okay to the man.

56:50.241 --> 56:51.909
We get married.

56:51.910 --> 56:54.871
We married for 55 years.

56:56.373 --> 56:59.334
(traffic commotion)

57:02.045 --> 57:03.712
I have to get this, I have to get this.

57:03.713 --> 57:05.881
Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

57:05.882 --> 57:06.715
I know, we'll find them something.

57:06.716 --> 57:08.550
There's great stuff here.

57:08.551 --> 57:09.885
We should've gone to the plant store.

57:09.886 --> 57:11.303
Here, perfect for them.

57:11.304 --> 57:13.263
What's that?

57:13.264 --> 57:16.183
Battery operated pith helmet, with fan.

57:16.184 --> 57:17.768
Why is this necessary in life?

57:17.769 --> 57:18.853
I don't know.

57:19.771 --> 57:22.439
Look at this, also makes great fries.

57:22.440 --> 57:23.273
Uh oh.

57:23.274 --> 57:24.108
Good.

57:24.109 --> 57:26.276
Hold off the dogs, the hunt is over.

57:26.277 --> 57:29.279
Sally, this is the greatest.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.782
Sally, please report to me.

57:31.783 --> 57:32.616
Look at this.

57:32.617 --> 57:34.660
This is the greatest,
you're gonna love this.

57:34.661 --> 57:36.286
This is a singing machine.

57:36.287 --> 57:37.121
Look.

57:37.122 --> 57:40.124
You sing the lead and it has
the backup and everything.

57:40.125 --> 57:41.041
This is from Oklahoma!

57:41.042 --> 57:41.959
Here is the lyrics right here.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.210
"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top."

57:43.211 --> 57:44.711
Yes, perfect.

57:44.712 --> 57:45.546
Oh.

57:45.547 --> 57:47.548
(pleasant music)

57:47.549 --> 57:50.426
♪ Chicks and ducks and
geese better scurry ♪

57:50.427 --> 57:56.306
♪ When I take you out in my surrey ♪

57:56.307 --> 57:58.100
♪ With the fringe on top ♪

57:58.101 --> 57:59.309
♪ Now you ♪

57:59.310 --> 58:01.895
♪ Watch that fringe and
see how it flutters ♪

58:01.896 --> 58:04.815
♪ When I drive them
high steppen strutters ♪

58:04.816 --> 58:07.484
♪ Nosy pokes will peek
through their shutters ♪

58:07.485 --> 58:09.903
♪ And their eyes will pop ♪

58:09.904 --> 58:11.321
♪ The wheels are yellow ♪

58:11.322 --> 58:12.781
♪ The upholstery's brown ♪

58:12.782 --> 58:15.451
♪ The dashboard's genuine leather ♪

58:15.452 --> 58:18.579
♪ With isinglass curtains you can roll ♪

58:18.580 --> 58:19.372
What?

58:20.373 --> 58:21.206
It's my voice, isn't it?

58:21.207 --> 58:23.625
I hate my voice.

58:23.626 --> 58:25.377
I know, it's terrible, Joe hated--

58:25.378 --> 58:27.212
It's Helen.

58:27.213 --> 58:28.006
Helen?

58:29.299 --> 58:31.508
She's coming right towards me.

58:31.509 --> 58:35.555
(pleasant karaoke machine music)

58:39.601 --> 58:40.602
How are you, Harry?

58:41.811 --> 58:42.854
Fine, I'm fine.

58:44.981 --> 58:46.648
This is Ira Stone.

58:46.649 --> 58:47.858
Harry Burns.

58:47.859 --> 58:48.651
[Ira] Harry.

58:49.736 --> 58:54.072
(pleasant karaoke machine music)

58:54.073 --> 58:55.741
I'm sorry, this is Sally Albright.

58:55.742 --> 58:56.534
Helen Hillson

58:57.577 --> 58:58.369
and Ira.

58:59.621 --> 59:01.288
Sally.

59:01.289 --> 59:02.623
Nice to meet you.

59:02.624 --> 59:03.416
Hi.

59:06.878 --> 59:07.670
Well,

59:09.255 --> 59:10.547
see you.

59:10.548 --> 59:11.508
Yeah, bye.

59:14.135 --> 59:15.552
Nice to meet you,

59:15.553 --> 59:17.095
Ira.

59:17.096 --> 59:21.642
(pleasant karaoke machine music)

59:21.643 --> 59:22.435
You okay?

59:24.979 --> 59:25.939
Yeah, I'm perfect.

59:27.565 --> 59:28.774
She looked weird, didn't she?

59:28.775 --> 59:31.068
She looked really weird,
she looked very weird.

59:31.069 --> 59:32.236
I've never seen her before.

59:32.237 --> 59:33.403
Trust me, she looked weird.

59:33.404 --> 59:34.947
Her legs looked heavy.

59:34.948 --> 59:36.365
Really, she must be retaining water.

59:36.366 --> 59:37.199
Harry.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.826
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

59:42.747 --> 59:45.040
[Sally] You sure you're okay?

59:45.041 --> 59:46.625
Oh, I'm fine.

59:46.626 --> 59:48.126
Look, it had to happen at some point,

59:48.127 --> 59:49.336
in a city of eight million people,

59:49.337 --> 59:50.629
you're bound to run into your ex-wife,

59:50.630 --> 59:52.130
so, boom, it happened,

59:52.131 --> 59:53.508
and now I'm fine.

59:57.387 --> 59:59.137
I like it, it works.

59:59.138 --> 01:00:00.347
It says "home" to me.

01:00:00.348 --> 01:00:01.348
All right, all right.

01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:03.268
Well let Harry and Sally be the judge.

01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:05.562
What do you think?

01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:08.230
It's nice.

01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:09.356
Case closed.

01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:11.858
Of course he likes it, he's a guy.

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:12.694
Sally?

01:00:15.572 --> 01:00:17.197
[Jess] What's so awful about it?

01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:19.199
It's so awful there's no way to even

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.618
begin to explain what's so awful about it.

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:23.912
Honey, I don't object
to any of your things.

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:24.913
[Marie] If we had an extra room

01:00:24.914 --> 01:00:27.374
you could put all of your things
including your bar stools.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:28.500
No, honey, wait, wait, wait,

01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:29.334
honey, honey, wait, wait, wait.

01:00:29.335 --> 01:00:30.962
You don't like my bar stools?

01:00:32.297 --> 01:00:34.965
Harry, come on, someone
has to be on my side.

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:36.258
I'm on your side,

01:00:36.259 --> 01:00:37.843
I'm just trying to help
you have good taste.

01:00:37.844 --> 01:00:40.470
I have good taste!

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:42.389
Everybody thinks they have good taste

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:43.223
and a sense of humor

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:45.100
but they couldn't possibly
all have good taste.

01:00:45.101 --> 01:00:47.185
You know, it's funny.

01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:49.521
We started out like this, Helen and I.

01:00:49.522 --> 01:00:51.273
We had blank walls, we hung things,

01:00:51.274 --> 01:00:53.108
we picked out tiles together.

01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:54.359
Then you know what happens?

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.028
Six years later, you find yourself singing

01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:58.531
"Surrey With The Fringe
On Top" in front of Ira!

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.950
Do we have to talk about this right now?

01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:04.244
Yes, I think that right now
actually is the perfect time

01:01:04.245 --> 01:01:06.079
to talk about this
because I want our friends

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.832
to benefit from the
wisdom of my experience.

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.459
Right now everything is great,

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.419
everyone is happy, everyone is in love,

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.755
and that's wonderful but you gotta know

01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:15.881
that sooner or later,

01:01:15.882 --> 01:01:17.132
you're going to be screaming at each other

01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:19.092
about who's gonna get this dish.

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.802
This eight dollar dish will cost you

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:22.304
a thousand dollars in phone calls

01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:24.389
to the legal firm of
that's-mine-this-is-yours.

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:25.223
[Sally] Harry.

01:01:25.224 --> 01:01:26.475
Please.

01:01:26.476 --> 01:01:28.060
Jess, Marie,

01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:29.895
do me a favor for your own good.

01:01:29.896 --> 01:01:32.314
Put your name in your books right now

01:01:32.315 --> 01:01:34.316
before they get mixed up and
you don't know who's is who's.

01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:35.901
Because some day, believe it or not,

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:39.655
you'll go 15 rounds over who's
gonna get this coffee table.

01:01:39.656 --> 01:01:42.032
This stupid, wagon wheel,

01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:44.702
Roy Rogers garage sale coffee table!

01:01:46.913 --> 01:01:48.622
I thought you liked it.

01:01:48.623 --> 01:01:50.249
I was being nice!

01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:54.961
(door thudding)

01:01:54.962 --> 01:01:56.339
He just bumped into Helen.

01:02:04.681 --> 01:02:05.682
I want you to know

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.020
that I never want that
wagon wheel coffee table.

01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:22.740
I know, I know, I
shouldn't have done it.

01:02:23.825 --> 01:02:25.742
Harry, you're gonna
have to try and find a way

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:28.578
of not expressing every
feeling that you have,

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.706
every moment that you have them.

01:02:30.707 --> 01:02:32.332
Oh really?

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:33.458
Yes.

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:35.753
There are times and places for things.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:38.797
Well the next time you're
giving a lecture series

01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:42.217
on social graces would you let
me know, 'cause I'll sign up.

01:02:42.218 --> 01:02:43.010
Hey.

01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:46.012
You don't have to take
your anger out on me.

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.306
Oh, I think I'm entitled to
throw a little anger your way,

01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:50.726
especially when I'm being
told how to live my life

01:02:50.727 --> 01:02:52.644
by Miss Hospital-Corners.

01:02:52.645 --> 01:02:53.895
What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:53.896 --> 01:02:56.148
I mean, nothing bothers you.

01:02:56.149 --> 01:02:58.483
You never get upset about anything!

01:02:58.484 --> 01:02:59.985
Don't be ridiculous!

01:02:59.986 --> 01:03:01.361
What?

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:02.988
You never get upset about Joe.

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:04.531
I never see that back up on you.

01:03:04.532 --> 01:03:05.907
How is that possible?

01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:08.452
Don't you experience any feelings of loss?

01:03:08.453 --> 01:03:10.287
I don't have to take this crap from you!

01:03:10.288 --> 01:03:12.831
If you're so over Joe, why
aren't you seeing anyone?

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:14.124
I see people!

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:14.958
See people.

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.669
Have you slept with one person
since you broke up with Joe?

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.547
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:23.593
That will prove I'm over Joe,
because I fucked somebody?

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:26.511
Harry you're gonna have
to move back to New Jersey

01:03:26.512 --> 01:03:28.346
because you've slept with
everybody in New York

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:29.681
and I don't see that turning Helen

01:03:29.682 --> 01:03:31.225
into a faint memory for you!

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:34.102
Besides, I will make love to somebody

01:03:34.103 --> 01:03:36.521
when it is "making love,"
not the way you do it

01:03:36.522 --> 01:03:38.566
like you're out for revenge or something!

01:03:40.026 --> 01:03:41.110
Are you finished now?

01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:43.654
Yes.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:45.615
Can I say something?

01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:47.825
Yes.

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:53.289
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:06.219
Don't say a word.

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:12.307
It's a monkey! It's a monkey!

01:04:12.308 --> 01:04:14.184
Monkey see, monkey do!

01:04:14.185 --> 01:04:15.185
It's an ape!

01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:16.019
Going ape!

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:16.813
It's a baby!

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:18.688
[Jess] Planet of the Apes!

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:19.523
Planet of the Apes?

01:04:19.524 --> 01:04:20.357
She just said it's a baby.

01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:21.233
How about "Planet of the Dopes?"

01:04:21.234 --> 01:04:22.734
It doesn't look like a baby.

01:04:22.735 --> 01:04:23.693
[Harry] Big mouth.

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:25.278
Mick Jagger as a baby.

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:26.238
[Jess] Baby ape! Baby ape!

01:04:26.239 --> 01:04:27.948
[Harry] Stop with the
apes, would you please?

01:04:27.949 --> 01:04:28.782
[Alice] Baby's breath.

01:04:28.783 --> 01:04:31.243
Rosemary's Baby's Mouth.

01:04:31.244 --> 01:04:32.452
Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?

01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:33.829
Kiss the baby.

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:35.288
Melancholy baby's mouth!

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:36.289
Baby fish mouth!

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:37.792
Baby fish mouth!

01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:40.502
[Man] 15 seconds.

01:04:40.503 --> 01:04:42.128
[Alice] Baby boom.

01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:43.463
[Harry] Baby?

01:04:43.464 --> 01:04:45.633
[Jess] Draw something
resembling anything.

01:04:46.509 --> 01:04:47.342
Crying baby.

01:04:47.343 --> 01:04:48.176
Kiss the baby.

01:04:48.177 --> 01:04:49.010
Baby spitting up.

01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:50.637
Exorcist baby.

01:04:50.638 --> 01:04:52.430
[Alice] Yes sir, that's my baby.

01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:54.140
[Harry] No sir, don't mean maybe.

01:04:54.141 --> 01:04:55.600
[Man] That's it, time's up.

01:04:55.601 --> 01:04:57.018
Baby talk.

01:04:57.019 --> 01:04:58.603
Baby talk?

01:04:58.604 --> 01:04:59.437
What's that?

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:00.272
That's not a saying.

01:05:00.273 --> 01:05:02.858
Oh but "baby fish mouth"
is sweeping the nation.

01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:04.568
I hear them talking.
(laughing)

01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:07.320
Final score, our team 110,

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:09.031
you guys, 60.

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:11.783
Fixed, definitely fixed.

01:05:11.784 --> 01:05:13.034
It's pathetic.

01:05:13.035 --> 01:05:14.119
I can't draw.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.081
No, that's a baby and
it's clearly talking.

01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:19.125
You're wonderful.

01:05:20.418 --> 01:05:22.127
[Marie] All right, who wants coffee?

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:22.961
[Jess] I do and I love you.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.045
[Alice] Do you have any tea?

01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:24.880
[Marie] One tea.

01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:26.339
Industrial strength.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.465
I'll help you.

01:05:27.466 --> 01:05:28.300
De-caf?

01:05:28.301 --> 01:05:29.093
Yeah.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:32.596
[Alice] Cream.

01:05:32.597 --> 01:05:33.471
[Woman] Where's the bathroom?

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:35.057
Through that door down the hall.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:39.312
(somber jazz music)

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.524
Never looked like a baby to me.

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:45.358
Which part?

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.192
All of it.

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:48.028
Hey, Jess, you were gonna
show me the cover of your book.

01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:49.654
Oh yeah, yeah, it's in the den.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:52.449
Look, Julian, help yourself.
have some more wine.

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.242
Whatever you like, okay?

01:05:54.243 --> 01:05:55.076
I like saying "It's in the den."

01:05:55.077 --> 01:05:56.953
It's got a nice ring to it.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:59.998
Emily is a little young
for Harry, don't you think?

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:02.792
Well she's young but
look what she's done.

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:03.710
What has she done?

01:06:03.711 --> 01:06:05.462
She makes desserts.

01:06:05.463 --> 01:06:07.339
Does Julian seem a little stuffy to you?

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.883
He's a good guy, you should
talk to him, get to know him.

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:11.343
He's too tall to talk to.

01:06:11.344 --> 01:06:14.055
She makes 35 hundred
chocolate mousse pies a week.

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:18.224
Emily is "Aunt Emily?"

01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:19.726
He took us all to a Met game last week.

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:20.936
It was great.

01:06:20.937 --> 01:06:22.771
You all went to a Met game together?

01:06:22.772 --> 01:06:23.605
Yeah,

01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:25.523
but it was a last minute thing.

01:06:25.524 --> 01:06:26.942
But Sally hates baseball.

01:06:26.943 --> 01:06:28.944
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

01:06:28.945 --> 01:06:30.863
Julian is great.

01:06:32.198 --> 01:06:33.281
I know.

01:06:33.282 --> 01:06:34.240
He's a grownup.

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:35.533
Emily is terrific.

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:36.576
Yeah.

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:37.869
Of course, when I asked her where she was

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.538
when Kennedy was shot she
said, "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

01:06:40.539 --> 01:06:41.290
No.

01:06:51.133 --> 01:06:53.426
(phone ringing)

01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:54.260
Hello.

01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:55.637
[Sally] Are you alone?

01:06:55.638 --> 01:06:57.847
Yeah, I was just finishing a book.

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.557
[Sally] Could you come over?

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:01.017
What's the matter?

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.852
He's getting married.

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:04.437
[Harry] Who?

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:05.272
Joe!

01:07:06.565 --> 01:07:07.608
I'll be right there.

01:07:11.237 --> 01:07:12.487
(sniffling)

01:07:12.488 --> 01:07:13.780
Hi.

01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:14.824
Are you all right?

01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:18.869
Come on in.

01:07:21.414 --> 01:07:22.789
(crying)

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:24.541
I'm sorry to call you so late.

01:07:24.542 --> 01:07:25.376
It's all right.

01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:28.837
I need a Kleenex.

01:07:28.838 --> 01:07:30.631
Okay.

01:07:31.632 --> 01:07:34.426
He just called me up,
"Wanted to see how you were."

01:07:34.427 --> 01:07:36.094
"Fine, how are you?"

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:37.262
"Fine."

01:07:37.263 --> 01:07:39.389
His secretary's on vacation,

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:40.890
everything's all backed up.

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:43.101
He's got a big case in New York.

01:07:43.102 --> 01:07:43.978
Blah, blah, blah.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.064
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking,

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:50.108
"I'm over him, I really am over him.

01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:52.402
"I can't believe that I'd
ever be remotely interested

01:07:52.403 --> 01:07:53.821
"in any of that."

01:07:54.989 --> 01:07:58.616
And then he said, "I have some news."

01:07:58.617 --> 01:08:00.661
(crying)

01:08:02.455 --> 01:08:05.165
She works in his office,
she's a paralegal.

01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:07.125
Her name is Kimberley.

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:08.793
(sobbing)

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:10.795
He just met her!

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:13.673
She's suppose to be his
transitional person,

01:08:13.674 --> 01:08:16.468
she's not suppose to be the one.

01:08:16.469 --> 01:08:18.595
(sobbing)

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:24.517
All this time I've been saying

01:08:24.518 --> 01:08:26.145
that he didn't want to get married

01:08:28.064 --> 01:08:29.356
but the truth is,

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.859
he didn't want to marry me.

01:08:36.322 --> 01:08:37.490
He didn't love me.

01:08:40.618 --> 01:08:42.702
(sobbing)

01:08:42.703 --> 01:08:45.330
If you could take him
back right now, would you?

01:08:45.331 --> 01:08:46.997
(sobbing)

01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:47.792
No!

01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:52.545
But why didn't he want to marry me?

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:54.546
What's the matter with me?

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:55.799
Nothing.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.925
I'm difficult.

01:08:56.926 --> 01:08:58.259
You're challenging.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.095
I'm too structured, I'm
completely closed off.

01:09:01.096 --> 01:09:02.096
But in a good way.

01:09:02.098 --> 01:09:03.014
(sobbing)

01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:06.018
No, no, no, I drove him away!

01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:09.939
And I'm gonna be 40.

01:09:11.941 --> 01:09:13.608
When?

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:14.818
Someday.

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:16.486
In eight years.

01:09:16.487 --> 01:09:17.862
But it's there.

01:09:17.863 --> 01:09:21.283
It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:25.078
And it's not the same for men.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:28.372
Charlie Chaplin had babies when he was 73.

01:09:28.374 --> 01:09:30.625
Yeah but he was too old to pick them up.

01:09:30.626 --> 01:09:33.127
(laughing)

01:09:33.129 --> 01:09:35.256
(sobbing)

01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:37.841
Aw, come here.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:38.675
Come here.

01:09:38.676 --> 01:09:40.551
It's gonna be okay.

01:09:40.553 --> 01:09:42.763
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

01:09:44.932 --> 01:09:47.058
Go ahead, it's not one
of my favorites anyway.

01:09:47.059 --> 01:09:49.685
(sobbing)

01:09:49.687 --> 01:09:50.604
It's gonna be okay.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.483
(huffing)

01:09:58.195 --> 01:09:59.071
Hmmm, okay.

01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:01.282
Okay.

01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:06.494
I'll make some tea.

01:10:06.495 --> 01:10:07.328
Harry?

01:10:07.329 --> 01:10:09.372
Could you just hold me a little longer?

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:09.985
Oh, sure.

01:10:16.172 --> 01:10:18.299
(sighing)

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:52.416
Are you comfortable?

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:54.126
Sure.

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:02.634
Do you want something
to drink or something?

01:11:02.635 --> 01:11:03.510
No, I'm okay.

01:11:05.304 --> 01:11:06.804
Well, I'm gonna get up for some water,

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:08.265
so it's really no trouble.

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:10.308
Okay.

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:11.101
Water.

01:11:19.443 --> 01:11:22.488
(somber piano music)

01:12:06.657 --> 01:12:08.283
You have all the video tapes alphabetized

01:12:08.284 --> 01:12:09.660
and on index cards.

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:13.329
Thank you.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.164
Do you wanna watch something?

01:12:15.165 --> 01:12:16.417
No, not unless you do.

01:12:17.293 --> 01:12:18.752
No, that's okay.

01:12:33.559 --> 01:12:36.019
Do you wanna go to sleep?

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:36.812
Okay.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:41.442
(somber piano music)

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.514
Where are you going?

01:13:14.058 --> 01:13:14.850
I gotta go.

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:19.062
Gotta go home, I gotta change my clothes

01:13:19.063 --> 01:13:20.855
and then I have to go
to work and so do you.

01:13:20.856 --> 01:13:22.398
But after work, I'd like
to take out to dinner

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:23.274
if you're free.

01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:24.734
Are you free?

01:13:24.735 --> 01:13:25.985
Yes.

01:13:25.986 --> 01:13:28.029
Fine, I'll call you later.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.366
Fine.

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:43.253
(phone ringing)

01:13:49.343 --> 01:13:50.135
Yours.

01:13:51.095 --> 01:13:51.928
Hello.

01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:53.262
I'm sorry to call so early.

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:54.097
Are you all right?

01:13:54.098 --> 01:13:55.431
No one I know would call at this hour.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:56.891
- I did something terrible.
- (phone ringing)

01:13:56.892 --> 01:13:57.725
What did you do?

01:13:57.726 --> 01:13:59.143
No one I know would call at this hour.

01:13:59.144 --> 01:14:00.353
- It's so awful.
- I need to talk.

01:14:00.354 --> 01:14:01.687
- What happened?
- What's the matter?

01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:02.522
Harry came over last night.

01:14:02.523 --> 01:14:03.940
I went over to Sally's last night.

01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:05.775
Because I was upset that
Joe was getting married.

01:14:05.776 --> 01:14:06.609
And one thing led to another.

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:08.111
And before I knew it we
were kissing and then--

01:14:08.112 --> 01:14:09.195
To make a long story short.

01:14:09.196 --> 01:14:10.279
[Harry And Sally] We did it.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.364
[Jess And Marie] They did it.

01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:12.698
That's great, Sally.

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:13.533
We've been praying for it.

01:14:13.534 --> 01:14:15.159
You should've done
it in the first place.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.411
For months we've been
saying you should do it.

01:14:16.412 --> 01:14:17.453
You guys belong together.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.163
It's like killing two
birds with one stone.

01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:21.082
It's like two wrongs make a right.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:21.916
[Jess And Marie] How was it?

01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:22.917
The during part was good.

01:14:22.918 --> 01:14:23.751
I thought it was good.

01:14:23.752 --> 01:14:24.669
And then I felt suffocated.

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.503
But then I guess it wasn't.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:26.963
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- The worst.

01:14:26.964 --> 01:14:27.797
I had to get out of there.

01:14:27.798 --> 01:14:28.631
He just disappeared.

01:14:28.632 --> 01:14:29.465
I feel so bad.

01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:30.508
I'm so embarrassed.

01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:31.717
- I don't blame you.
- That's horrible.

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:32.635
I think I'm coming down with something.

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:33.845
I think I'm catching a cold.

01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:35.346
Look, it would've been
great if it worked out

01:14:35.347 --> 01:14:36.180
but it didn't.

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:37.515
You should never go to bed with anyone

01:14:37.516 --> 01:14:39.392
when you find out your
boyfriend is getting married.

01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:40.268
Who's that talking?

01:14:40.269 --> 01:14:41.102
Who?

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:41.894
Is that Jess on the phone?

01:14:41.895 --> 01:14:42.812
It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.

01:14:42.813 --> 01:14:43.646
It's Bryant Gumbel.

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:45.231
[Jess And Marie] Do you
wanna come over for breakfast?

01:14:45.232 --> 01:14:46.399
No, I'm not up to it.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.525
No, I feel too awful.

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:48.818
[Jess And Marie] Good.

01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:50.153
I mean, it's so early.

01:14:50.154 --> 01:14:51.404
But call me later if you want.

01:14:51.405 --> 01:14:52.238
I'll call you later, okay?

01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:53.364
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:14:53.365 --> 01:14:54.908
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:14:57.286 --> 01:14:58.078
God.

01:14:59.037 --> 01:14:59.830
I know.

01:15:01.081 --> 01:15:03.292
Tell me I never have
to be out there again.

[Harry Voiceover]
Sally, it was a mistake.

01:15:22.019 --> 01:15:24.271
[Sally Voiceover] I just
hope I get to say it first.

01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:27.983
[Harry Voiceover] I hope
she says it before I do.

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.361
It was a mistake.

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:34.698

It was.

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:42.080
Yes, it was.

01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:45.249
We just never should've done it.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.418
I couldn't agree more.

01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:49.629
I am so relieved.

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:50.630
Great.

01:15:50.631 --> 01:15:51.631
Yeah.

01:15:51.632 --> 01:15:53.842

[Waiter] Two mixed green salads.

01:16:05.437 --> 01:16:07.731
(crunching)

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:28.709
It is so nice when
you can sit with someone

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.253
and not have to talk.

01:16:30.254 --> 01:16:31.046
Hmm?

01:16:35.342 --> 01:16:38.302
It's just like most of the time
you go to bed with someone,

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:39.929
she tells you all of her stories,

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.764
you tell her your stories.

01:16:41.765 --> 01:16:44.016
But with Sally and me,

01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:46.269
we've already heard each other's stories.

01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:47.562
So once we went to bed,

01:16:47.563 --> 01:16:50.231
we didn't know what we were
suppose to do, you know?

01:16:50.232 --> 01:16:51.233
[Jess] Sure, Harry.

01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:54.527
I don't know.

01:16:54.528 --> 01:16:56.779
Maybe you get to a certain
point in a relationship

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.157
where it's just too late
to have sex, you know?

01:17:10.168 --> 01:17:13.004
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

01:17:13.005 --> 01:17:13.964
I don't think so.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.050

01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:21.221
He was seeing this anthropologist but.

What does she look like?

01:17:24.391 --> 01:17:27.101
Thin, pretty, big tits.

01:17:27.102 --> 01:17:28.270

here today to celebrate

01:18:19.613 --> 01:18:22.491
the marriage of Marie and Jess,

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:26.786
and to consecrate their vows of matrimony.

01:18:26.787 --> 01:18:30.498
The vows they take to join their lives,

01:18:30.499 --> 01:18:32.792
the wine they will share

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:35.711
binds all their hopes together

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.089

01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:41.968

She's a totally different person.

01:18:57.442 --> 01:18:58.984
Oh yeah, she is.

01:18:58.985 --> 01:18:59.860
It's great.

01:18:59.861 --> 01:19:01.363
What're we gonna do about you?

- Honey?

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:37.691
Fine.

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:40.276
Are you seeing anybody?

01:19:40.277 --> 01:19:41.360

- What?

01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:42.528
I don't wanna talk about this.

01:19:42.529 --> 01:19:43.362
Why not?

01:19:43.363 --> 01:19:45.449
I don't want to talk about it.

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:48.325
Why can't we get past this?

I mean, are we gonna carry
this thing around forever?

01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:52.663
Forever, it just happened.

It happened three weeks ago.

01:19:55.459 --> 01:19:56.500
You know how a year to a person

01:19:56.501 --> 01:19:58.086
is like seven years to a dog?

01:19:59.379 --> 01:20:00.172
Yes.

01:20:03.508 --> 01:20:06.802
Is one of us supposed to
be a dog in this scenario?

01:20:06.803 --> 01:20:08.137
Yes.

01:20:08.138 --> 01:20:09.472
Who is the dog?

01:20:09.473 --> 01:20:10.639
You are.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.766
I am?

- I am the dog.
- Mhmm.

I am the dog.

01:20:21.318 --> 01:20:22.318
I don't see that, Harry.

If anybody is the dog, you are the dog.

happened didn't mean anything.

I'm not saying it didn't mean anything.

01:20:27.949 --> 01:20:29.909
I am saying, why does it
have to mean everything?

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:31.202
Because it does!

01:20:31.203 --> 01:20:32.828
And you should know
that better than anybody

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:33.996
because the minute that it happened,

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:35.331
you walked right out the door.

01:20:35.332 --> 01:20:36.332
I didn't walk out.

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:38.375
No, sprinted is more like it.

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:39.752
We both agreed it was a mistake!

01:20:39.753 --> 01:20:41.713
[Sally] The worst mistake I ever made!

01:20:43.632 --> 01:20:44.465
What do you want from me?

01:20:44.466 --> 01:20:45.883
I don't want anything from you!

01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:50.054
I did not go over there that
night to make love to you,

01:20:50.055 --> 01:20:51.680
that is not why I went there.

01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:53.432

with these big weepy eyes.

What was I supposed to do?

What are you saying,
you took pity on me?

01:20:59.898 --> 01:21:00.731
No, I was--

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:35.547
Fresh air, I have the
streets all to myself.

01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:37.299
Who needs to be at a big, crowded party

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.551
pretending to have a good time?

01:25:39.552 --> 01:25:40.677
Plus this is the perfect time

01:25:40.678 --> 01:25:42.347
to catch up on my window shopping.

01:25:43.598 --> 01:25:44.765
This is good.

01:25:44.766 --> 01:25:47.477

01:25:56.861 --> 01:26:00.364

01:26:02.742 --> 01:26:06.578

01:26:43.074 --> 01:26:43.907
[Harry Voiceover]
You realize, of course,

01:26:43.908 --> 01:26:45.742
that we can never be friends.

01:26:45.743 --> 01:26:46.994
[Sally Voiceover] Why not?

01:26:46.995 --> 01:26:48.036
[Harry Voiceover] What I'm saying

01:26:48.037 --> 01:26:49.746
is that men and women can't be friends

01:26:49.747 --> 01:26:52.207
because the sex part
always gets in the way.

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:53.458
[Sally Voiceover] That's not true.

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:54.626
[Harry Voiceover] No man can be friends

01:26:54.627 --> 01:26:56.170
with a woman he finds attractive.

01:26:56.171 --> 01:26:58.297
He always wants to have sex with her.

01:26:58.298 --> 01:26:59.131
[Sally Voiceover] What if they

01:26:59.132 --> 01:27:00.382
don't wanna have sex with you?

01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:01.216
[Harry Voiceover] Doesn't matter

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:02.634
because the sex thing
is already out there,

01:27:02.635 --> 01:27:04.178
so the friendship is ultimately doomed

01:27:04.179 --> 01:27:05.805
and that is the end of the story.

01:27:06.973 --> 01:27:07.806
[Sally Voiceover]
Well, I guess we're not

01:27:07.807 --> 01:27:08.640
gonna be friends then.

01:27:08.641 --> 01:27:09.892
[Harry Voiceover] Guess not.

01:27:09.893 --> 01:27:11.727
[Sally Voiceover] It's too bad.

01:27:11.728 --> 01:27:14.230

we should remember them,

too, I remembered you.

very rich chocolate sauce on the side.

Right because not everybody
