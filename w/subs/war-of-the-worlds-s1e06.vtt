WEBVTT

00:32.320 --> 00:33.321
There you go.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.200
Did you have a girlfriend in Sudan?

00:39.930 --> 00:40.660
No.

00:42.481 --> 00:43.521
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:43.921 --> 00:45.121
No one special.

00:45.721 --> 00:47.281
Can you pass my shoes?

00:56.640 --> 00:57.680
Are you jealous?

00:58.090 --> 00:59.420
No.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.680
Liar.

01:01.481 --> 01:02.561
You're jealous.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.239
You don't know what I'm thinking.

01:04.416 --> 01:07.000
I can hear it...in  your voice.

01:17.641 --> 01:19.081
What is it?

01:33.648 --> 01:35.280
I can see you.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.250
There's one of those things

02:21.280 --> 02:22.510
hidden in the stairwell.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.280
Get the others.

02:29.601 --> 02:30.721
They found us.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.944
We gotta go.

02:49.761 --> 02:50.561
Wait here.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.728
Oh shit...Oh Shit.

03:22.672 --> 03:23.720
Emily.

03:57.808 --> 03:58.640
Emily.

04:03.001 --> 04:04.641
Oh man, what's up?

04:05.281 --> 04:07.361
Tense. Freaky shit.

04:08.161 --> 04:09.761
How did she do that?

04:12.081 --> 04:13.441
I don't know.

04:43.130 --> 04:45.340
The compass is all over the place.

04:47.340 --> 04:49.580
There's a magnetic field here.

04:52.950 --> 04:54.800
It must be the spacecraft.

04:55.190 --> 04:58.030
It's acting as a magnetic monopole.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.010
What's that?

05:00.320 --> 05:02.920
A field with one magnetic pole.

05:04.770 --> 05:07.070
That's why the compass isn't working.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.380
In theory they can exist,

05:11.110 --> 05:13.790
but we've never found one.

05:41.161 --> 05:43.801
My Mum says we're going
to England with you.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.280
It looks that way.

05:53.481 --> 05:55.561
So you think you can protect us?

05:57.481 --> 05:59.441
I don't know.
I can try.

06:02.961 --> 06:05.081
Noah thought he could protect us too.

06:06.928 --> 06:08.520
Yeah, what happened to him?

06:12.001 --> 06:13.361
He was shot.

06:16.040 --> 06:16.730
He was bleeding...

06:16.760 --> 06:18.920
and...there was so much blood.

06:20.000 --> 06:20.780
I tried to stop it

06:20.810 --> 06:22.760
but there was nothing I could do.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.650
Take what you want.
We leaving.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.090
If the signal came from here ...

06:48.370 --> 06:51.450
it must have crashed
when we locked on to it.

06:53.730 --> 06:54.900
Do you think there's a connection?

06:55.220 --> 06:56.600
I don't know.

07:11.420 --> 07:12.910
Should they be doing that?

07:13.540 --> 07:15.100
No, but the men need it...

07:15.140 --> 07:17.180
they need to feel some
sort of control.

07:19.170 --> 07:21.250
I'm not sure that helps much.

07:22.410 --> 07:24.200
And if the roles were reversed?

07:24.580 --> 07:26.310
What if you were one of the soldiers?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.350
What would you feel?

07:29.580 --> 07:30.540
Despair.

07:35.048 --> 07:36.458
We're leaving.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.650
What were you doing?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.510
I don't know.

10:03.841 --> 10:05.441
There's no colours.

10:05.841 --> 10:07.361
It's black and white.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.320
It's like it...

10:09.950 --> 10:11.790
It's like it...forms in front of me.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.561
Does that only happen
when you hear the sound?

10:17.312 --> 10:19.480
It happened before at the hospital.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.664
Can you hear it now?

10:28.761 --> 10:30.641
We can't stay.
They know we're here.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.520
We're going to the university
where Bill works.

10:33.680 --> 10:34.660
What about Dad?

10:34.700 --> 10:35.680
We should be going home.

10:35.841 --> 10:37.161
Oh, we will.

10:37.321 --> 10:39.601
But right now we should
stay with the others.

11:31.201 --> 11:32.321
What does that mean?

11:33.201 --> 11:34.881
It's the time the attacks started.

11:35.681 --> 11:37.961
There must be other
people out there.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.144
Hello?

12:31.056 --> 12:32.048
Sacha!

12:32.336 --> 12:33.710
I'm going to check upstairs.

12:56.921 --> 12:58.841
It's a back up generator.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.120
Are there other ways
into the building?

13:01.184 --> 13:02.544
There's a door down the back

13:02.580 --> 13:03.870
and there's fire escapes

13:03.920 --> 13:05.640
in the stairwell around there.

13:06.561 --> 13:07.881
This way guys.

13:29.761 --> 13:31.601
It's pretty gruesome isn't it?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.601
That's Darwinism in action.

13:36.761 --> 13:38.641
The strongest genes survive.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.841
Is that why they're killing us?

13:43.081 --> 13:45.161
I don't think it's
as simple as that.

13:47.361 --> 13:49.041
Maybe they're just evil.

13:49.481 --> 13:50.841
They get off on it.

13:52.281 --> 13:53.841
They want to live.

13:55.841 --> 13:57.521
They're scared of dying.

13:58.841 --> 14:01.001
Why do you say that?

14:02.641 --> 14:04.081
I can feel it.

15:14.570 --> 15:17.390
<i>Muscular Dystrophy</i>

15:57.961 --> 15:59.601
What are you thinking?

16:02.121 --> 16:03.401
About what?

16:04.841 --> 16:06.281
About what happened...

16:07.081 --> 16:07.961
with that thing.

16:10.961 --> 16:11.881
I don't know.

16:12.241 --> 16:14.601
It looks like you had sex
with a freak.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.672
You're not a freak.

16:16.721 --> 16:18.161
Then what am I?

16:20.600 --> 16:21.648
You're beautiful.

16:22.961 --> 16:23.761
Shut up!

16:23.921 --> 16:25.001
It's true.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.010
I thought you were beautiful

16:27.030 --> 16:28.100
from the moment you pissed

16:28.130 --> 16:29.340
on me in the shop.

16:31.041 --> 16:32.761
You're making jokes now.

16:33.121 --> 16:35.921
I'm just trying to make
you feel better.

16:43.841 --> 16:46.401
What happened...to your family?

16:53.441 --> 16:56.641
Government soldiers came
to our village.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.096
They killed them.

17:01.361 --> 17:02.481
Why?

17:04.441 --> 17:05.761
They are Dinka.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.601
We are Nuer.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.968
We've always fought each other.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.579
I can't imagine how you begin to

17:14.630 --> 17:15.800
deal with something like that.

17:17.681 --> 17:20.040
I joined the White Army.

17:21.361 --> 17:22.761
The militia.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.420
I wanted revenge

17:26.450 --> 17:28.520
for what they did to my family.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.121
You killed people?

17:36.681 --> 17:40.161
Maybe now you think
I'm a freak?

17:41.721 --> 17:43.121
Or worse.

17:45.088 --> 17:46.768
If someone did that to my family

17:47.120 --> 17:48.800
I think I'd want to kill them too.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.881
Then you have lost everything.

17:53.321 --> 17:55.041
Even yourself.

18:03.361 --> 18:05.481
Whatever is happening to you...

18:06.001 --> 18:08.201
you saved all of our lives.

18:08.761 --> 18:11.441
Maybe we should be grateful for it.

18:22.081 --> 18:23.201
You're not lost.

18:34.721 --> 18:36.761
Is that what's making Emily see again?

18:36.921 --> 18:38.841
She seems to think so.

18:41.056 --> 18:43.840
Ah, perhaps it's some kind of sensor?

18:44.760 --> 18:46.336
Maybe it's a processor too?

18:46.368 --> 18:47.840
So she's not blind any more?

18:48.121 --> 18:50.761
You know there's a phenomenon
called "blind sight"?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.720
Where a blind person...

18:52.750 --> 18:54.360
can know where an object is

18:54.401 --> 18:55.921
without physically seeing it.

18:56.081 --> 18:58.161
They can take up a cup
without thinking.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.290
Isn't that because she can

18:59.320 --> 19:00.160
remember where it is?

19:00.321 --> 19:01.281
Not always.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.420
You know, when you and I
process the world,

19:03.440 --> 19:04.510
we fill in the gaps.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.760
It's what's called consciousness.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.670
And although a blind person

19:08.720 --> 19:09.980
has less information...

19:10.050 --> 19:11.150
Because their eyes are fucked.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.201
I wouldn't put it quite like that

19:14.521 --> 19:17.481
but they do have an
enhanced consciousness.

19:19.761 --> 19:21.441
There's something on this.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.241
What is it?

19:24.161 --> 19:25.241
It's like...

19:25.881 --> 19:27.081
a binary code.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.690
So what's the score with your girlfriend

19:36.710 --> 19:38.070
and these things?

19:41.121 --> 19:43.161
I just saying 'cause
it's not normal, right?

19:43.321 --> 19:45.161
We don't know what it is.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.080
You're right, we don't.

19:47.880 --> 19:48.730
Maybe that's a problem.

19:48.780 --> 19:49.920
She saved us.

19:49.970 --> 19:50.880
Did she?

19:53.081 --> 19:54.521
Is that what was happening?

19:57.201 --> 19:58.761
Like I said, I just saying...

19:59.121 --> 20:00.721
Maybe you say too much.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.930
Well, you wouldn't be the first person

20:01.950 --> 20:03.160
to tell me that.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.681
Someone's still out there.

20:26.921 --> 20:27.881
Sorry about Noah.

20:32.321 --> 20:33.241
How's Sacha?

20:34.841 --> 20:36.201
You think he's okay?

20:36.600 --> 20:37.510
What do you mean?

20:39.080 --> 20:39.780
I don't know.

20:39.940 --> 20:40.970
They seemed closer.

20:41.321 --> 20:43.201
Were they close, or...?

20:44.800 --> 20:46.810
Why do you ask that question?

20:47.960 --> 20:48.860
I was just curious.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.010
Did he say something to you?

20:50.010 --> 20:50.740
No.

21:45.780 --> 21:48.580
Tomorrow we'll go back
at the observatory.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.800
Keep your boots on..

21:54.260 --> 21:55.360
Just in case we have to leave suddenly.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.400
Thanks.

22:10.660 --> 22:13.200
I used to have a...

22:14.060 --> 22:15.110
simple life.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.490
My biggest problems were

22:20.870 --> 22:22.370
drinking too much..

22:28.560 --> 22:29.750
and not getting enough exercise.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.760
I wanted to leave the army.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.420
Why?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.670
I d seen too much.

22:39.990 --> 22:42.060
The things people are capable
of doing to one another.

22:45.752 --> 22:47.882
You begin to find it normal.
You have to.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.870
What did you do besides your work?

22:54.840 --> 22:56.160
I worked a lot.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.980
And looked after Sophia.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.000
She was an addict.

23:07.330 --> 23:08.300
To what?

23:09.280 --> 23:11.540
Pills, alcohol...anything.

23:15.130 --> 23:16.800
I tried to help her...

23:17.370 --> 23:18.780
but I'd had enough.

23:19.710 --> 23:20.810
I couldn't...

23:22.220 --> 23:24.290
I couldn't take it any more.

23:27.050 --> 23:28.990
So I kicked her out.

23:37.270 --> 23:39.240
If I hadn't done that...

23:40.210 --> 23:42.940
If we'd kept in touch...

23:43.980 --> 23:46.520
But when I called I only got voicemail.

23:47.170 --> 23:49.640
She should have been with me
at the observatory.

23:49.850 --> 23:50.410
No.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.790
She needed me...

23:53.180 --> 23:54.510
and I abandoned her.

23:56.110 --> 23:58.450
It sounds like you did all you could.

24:01.887 --> 24:03.037
Try to get some rest.

25:31.641 --> 25:32.961
I couldn't sleep.

25:33.121 --> 25:34.361
Yeah, you okay?

25:39.521 --> 25:41.681
Do you think there's a
reason we survived?

25:42.921 --> 25:44.201
Aye, we're just lucky.

25:45.081 --> 25:46.281
What if it...

25:47.041 --> 25:48.641
it's more than that?

25:50.321 --> 25:51.801
Yeah, like what?

25:56.281 --> 25:57.361
I don't know.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.841
What are you doing?

26:02.681 --> 26:04.361
They have cool stuff.

26:05.601 --> 26:06.761
I'm not sure you should be doing that.

26:10.001 --> 26:11.441
They don't need it.

26:12.561 --> 26:13.801
They're dead.

26:16.801 --> 26:17.841
What do you think?

26:18.081 --> 26:19.401
Just put it back.

26:21.801 --> 26:22.801
You don't tell me what to do.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.110
I'm not sure how your Mum would feel

26:25.120 --> 26:26.570
about you stealing other
people's things.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.010
It's not stealing if they're dead.

26:42.681 --> 26:44.681
What were you and my
Mum talking about?

26:45.481 --> 26:46.161
What?

26:46.321 --> 26:47.441
You were talking about me?

26:49.881 --> 26:51.361
Your mum was upset.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.810
She was talking about Noah.

26:53.910 --> 26:55.270
You think she cares about Noah?

26:56.800 --> 26:57.760
He knew nothing.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.880
Why are you even here?

27:00.170 --> 27:01.010
We're not your family.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.120
It's just the way things
have worked out.

27:05.361 --> 27:06.961
It's the way things are now.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.650
Maybe they'll change.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.401
Just get some sleep.

27:44.081 --> 27:45.721
No one wants to see that.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.360
Is there any water?

27:58.721 --> 27:59.841
Do you want me to get you some?

28:00.281 --> 28:01.761
I need to pee.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.681
Nobody wants to hear that.

28:22.620 --> 28:24.000
Why's this happening to her?

28:25.520 --> 28:28.000
I think it's connected to
the genetic mutation

28:28.020 --> 28:29.140
that gave her the Stargardts.

28:29.161 --> 28:31.161
I carry the gene and
it's not affecting me.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.220
What about your husband?

28:34.721 --> 28:36.201
No, it's...it's just me.

28:39.121 --> 28:42.761
Jonathan's not her biological father.

28:45.281 --> 28:47.801
It didn't change the way
he felt about her.

28:49.201 --> 28:51.601
He just never felt the same way about me.

28:53.321 --> 28:54.441
I'm sorry.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.260
Emily doesn't know.

28:58.561 --> 28:59.721
Of course.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.360
Do you have room in your pack?

29:12.610 --> 29:13.280
Yeah.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.720
Come and eat something.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.690
Did you sleep well?

29:35.730 --> 29:37.160
You look rested.

29:39.380 --> 29:40.570
Grab yourself some breakfast.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.470
Is this your daughter?

30:04.601 --> 30:05.641
Yeah.

30:06.921 --> 30:07.841
Can I get it back?

30:10.700 --> 30:12.690
Come on, give it back.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.750
Is everything alright?

30:46.241 --> 30:47.161
Sorry.

31:09.961 --> 31:12.721
I should take over from Ash.

31:17.121 --> 31:18.441
Go on, then.

31:18.761 --> 31:19.441
Say it.

31:20.081 --> 31:21.441
I'm worried about you.

31:21.801 --> 31:23.961
We're being careful so
you don't need to.

31:24.121 --> 31:26.321
I'm not worried about you
getting pregnant.

31:27.121 --> 31:28.321
Really?

31:28.760 --> 31:29.690
That's new.

31:29.720 --> 31:30.440
Emily.

31:30.601 --> 31:32.281
I can see again.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.990
Do you have any idea how
amazing it feels?

31:37.050 --> 31:38.540
We don't know why it's happening.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.680
It doesn't matter.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.400
What happened with that creature...

31:41.430 --> 31:43.360
You can't just be grateful for it?

31:43.410 --> 31:45.120
I'm too fucking scared to be grateful!

31:45.160 --> 31:47.120
I'm trying to keep us alive!

31:48.481 --> 31:49.641
Really?

31:51.481 --> 31:53.521
What exactly have you done, Mum?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.020
What have you done?

31:55.290 --> 31:56.200
I'm trying.

31:58.401 --> 31:59.681
That's amazing.

32:00.721 --> 32:01.921
Good job.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.680
Want some company?

32:33.161 --> 32:34.681
Sometimes I think...

32:35.480 --> 32:36.400
if we're going to die

32:36.430 --> 32:38.440
maybe it's better to get it over with.

32:38.601 --> 32:40.121
You don't mean that.

32:41.041 --> 32:42.281
Don't I?

32:47.160 --> 32:48.450
When I knew Dan was dead

32:48.480 --> 32:50.400
I found some sleeping pills.

32:51.201 --> 32:52.881
I was going to use them.

32:55.481 --> 32:56.961
Why didn't you?

33:00.081 --> 33:02.081
I couldn't do it to Bill.

33:03.921 --> 33:05.401
Your children are alive.

33:05.561 --> 33:07.081
You're all together.

33:08.281 --> 33:09.801
Maybe that's as good as it gets.

33:14.281 --> 33:16.161
It's Tom's birthday today.

33:16.321 --> 33:17.801
He's 15.

33:19.401 --> 33:21.441
I don't think he's even realised.

33:22.121 --> 33:24.521
I always made a big fuss of him
on his birthday.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.100
But with everything that's
happened to Emily

33:26.120 --> 33:28.240
she got so much attention, so...

33:28.401 --> 33:29.481
his day.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.321
We should throw him a party.

33:31.601 --> 33:33.041
I'm serious.

33:33.201 --> 33:34.201
We survived.

33:34.361 --> 33:35.521
Now, we've got to live.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.201
Fuck 'em, you know?

33:39.561 --> 33:40.841
We passed some shops,

33:41.161 --> 33:42.481
they're not far.

33:43.881 --> 33:45.081
Maybe we could all use a party.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.520
Next.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.161
Next.

33:57.721 --> 33:58.841
Stop.

34:04.841 --> 34:06.321
Jesus Christ.

34:08.920 --> 34:09.960
What is it?

34:10.841 --> 34:12.761
It's a map of our DNA.

34:14.081 --> 34:16.561
They're scanning our DNA.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.880
All this stuff seemed like
such important shit.

34:43.521 --> 34:45.041
Now, who gives a fuck.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.721
Has anybody seen Helen?

34:48.241 --> 34:49.360
Not for a while.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.400
I think she was with my Mum.

35:17.590 --> 35:19.040
Help me!

35:19.321 --> 35:20.561
Help me!

35:50.041 --> 35:51.281
Daisy!

36:36.961 --> 36:37.841
This way.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.161
This way.

36:44.481 --> 36:45.761
It's going to be okay.

36:58.121 --> 36:58.881
Push.

36:59.921 --> 37:00.841
Push!

38:30.401 --> 38:31.721
Where were you?

38:32.960 --> 38:34.281
God, what happened?

38:34.330 --> 38:36.130
We went to get some stuff
for Tom's birthday.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.160
God.

38:37.681 --> 38:39.481
I was so...
I was so worried about you.

38:39.641 --> 38:41.001
I'm fine.

39:22.801 --> 39:24.521
Happy Birthday!

39:28.560 --> 39:29.450
Make a wish.

39:37.001 --> 39:38.281
It's from me.

39:38.721 --> 39:39.881
Thank you.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.090
I love you.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.040
I love you too.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.081
There you go.

39:52.201 --> 39:53.521
How did you get...

39:54.121 --> 39:55.881
This is from me and Bill.

40:12.121 --> 40:13.161
Thank you.

40:13.401 --> 40:15.041
Happy Birthday, Tom.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.110
I've got something for you.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.480
It's not my birthday.

40:36.561 --> 40:37.521
I'm sorry.

40:38.841 --> 40:40.041
It's okay.

40:43.841 --> 40:44.641
They are fresh.

40:44.780 --> 40:45.710
You're fresh.

40:45.750 --> 40:46.720
So is this.

40:51.521 --> 40:53.961
I want you to teach me
how to use a gun.

41:46.561 --> 41:48.881
Where have you got to
with these things?

41:50.610 --> 41:52.210
They seem to know much more about us

41:52.230 --> 41:53.120
than we do about them.

41:56.121 --> 41:58.481
I think they're scanning our DNA.

41:58.641 --> 41:59.361
Why?

42:00.081 --> 42:03.161
Ash said they took babies
from the hospital.

42:03.881 --> 42:05.481
It could be connected.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.000
What is it?

42:08.250 --> 42:09.760
The woman we tried to save....

42:09.800 --> 42:11.750
One of these things was
dragging her away.

42:11.800 --> 42:12.920
She was pregnant.

42:13.641 --> 42:15.521
Why are they interested in babies?

42:16.041 --> 42:17.401
I don't know.

42:19.441 --> 42:21.321
You'll figure it out.

42:22.201 --> 42:23.361
I have to keep watch.

42:24.050 --> 42:25.070
Would you...

42:25.500 --> 42:27.190
Would you like me to keep you company?

42:27.640 --> 42:28.710
Yeah, I'd like that.
