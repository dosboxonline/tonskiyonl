27:34.112 --> 27:37.783
Okay, um,
summer after college,

27:37.866 --> 27:39.535
I was hiking near Eureka

27:39.618 --> 27:41.078
with this man
I was in love with.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.872
And we were way high up
in the forest.

27:43.956 --> 27:48.168
We found these old ruins
from a Native American village

27:48.252 --> 27:50.337
from hundreds of years ago.

27:50.420 --> 27:55.008
And we stood there
in the middle of the village

27:55.092 --> 27:57.135
and just listened to the sound
of the ocean waves

27:57.219 --> 28:00.722
crashing on the beach
from far away.

28:00.806 --> 28:02.933
And we tried to imagine,
you know,

28:03.016 --> 28:04.643
what those people
were like

28:04.726 --> 28:09.982
who were now, um,
um, lost to time.

28:10.065 --> 28:13.277
These were people who had
their own laws and beliefs

28:13.360 --> 28:16.488
and hopes for the future
of their own village.

28:19.783 --> 28:22.452
You know, I was one
of the very first people

28:22.536 --> 28:24.037
here in Alexandria,

28:24.121 --> 28:27.040
back when it started, back when we...

28:27.124 --> 28:29.585
we thought we knew
what it was going to be.

28:32.004 --> 28:34.631
And recently, I've been
thinking more and more

28:34.715 --> 28:35.799
about that village.

28:35.883 --> 28:37.843
What happened
to those people?

42:41.728 --> 42:43.313
I don't expect it.

42:43.397 --> 42:44.940
Maybe I don't deserve it.

42:52.364 --> 42:55.492
Something wrong?

42:55.576 --> 42:56.952
You just reminded me
of something

42:57.035 --> 42:59.204
a friend of mine
used to say.

43:02.749 --> 43:05.043
What's that?

43:09.173 --> 43:12.426
"My mercy prevails
over my wrath."

43:39.411 --> 43:41.914
Okay.

43:43.207 --> 43:45.000
So, you're trying
to get home.

43:49.963 --> 43:52.299
Just tell me
where that is.

43:52.382 --> 43:54.259
I can't tell you
where I live.

43:55.969 --> 43:57.179
My family's there.

43:57.262 --> 43:59.765
This is how you get
back to them.

43:59.848 --> 44:02.809
Or keep them safe.

44:02.893 --> 44:05.020
Your wife and kids
don't know where you are

44:06.480 --> 44:09.024
or whether you're
ever gonna come back.

44:09.107 --> 44:11.652
Don't put them
through that.

44:19.284 --> 44:23.038
I live on Bloodsworth Island
in Tangier Sound.

Hard to find...

44:28.293 --> 44:29.795

44:33.298 --> 44:36.760
Like I said, I didn't mean
to break in, cause any chaos,

44:36.844 --> 44:39.555
but I needed a boat
on your pier.

good intentions or not,

44:45.686 --> 44:48.313
you owe them
for all that damage,

44:48.397 --> 44:51.984
and you're not going anywhere
until we figure that out.

44:52.067 --> 44:53.902
You have enemies to fight.

44:56.905 --> 44:59.658
Maybe we can help
each other out.

45:01.702 --> 45:03.954
What do you mean?

45:13.881 --> 45:15.465
What'd he tell you?

45:16.592 --> 45:19.928
He lives on a naval base,

45:20.012 --> 45:21.847
an island about
two days from here.

45:23.807 --> 45:26.351
Could be weapons big enough
to kill a herd.

45:28.270 --> 45:30.898
Take out Alpha
once and for all.

45:30.981 --> 45:32.733
And he'd just
let you have 'em?

45:32.816 --> 45:35.652
Oh, yeah.

45:35.736 --> 45:38.322
Then I need to find a way
to bring them back.

45:41.408 --> 45:44.620
So, what's wrong?

45:44.703 --> 45:47.664
It would have to be me...

45:47.748 --> 45:50.792
just me
taking that kind of risk.

45:53.045 --> 45:55.839
But also...

45:55.923 --> 45:58.509
I should get back.

45:58.592 --> 46:00.844
With everything happening
at home, we should be together.

46:00.928 --> 46:02.471
Fighting together.

46:07.726 --> 46:10.687
But this
could end the war.

46:10.771 --> 46:13.065
Right?

46:13.148 --> 46:14.858
Maybe.

46:18.487 --> 46:20.030
I have to find out.

46:24.409 --> 46:27.204
It's okay, Mom.

46:27.287 --> 46:28.789
You do.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.712
We can't lose anyone else.

Mary lied to us, alright?

47:11.164 --> 47:12.958
They were protecting
this place.

47:13.041 --> 47:14.710
T-They put a trap in the road
as a deterrent.

47:14.793 --> 47:15.794
Yeah, from some hunter
a decade ago.

47:15.878 --> 47:17.004
AARON:
No. That thing was rigged

47:17.087 --> 47:18.672
more recently than that,
and you know it.

47:18.755 --> 47:21.008
You wanna stand around
and figure it out?

47:21.091 --> 47:25.345
AARON: Look, the herd could have been
here last week or yesterday.

47:25.429 --> 47:27.181
We had an obligation
to come check this out.

about this.

Whatever weapons you have
on your island

48:08.514 --> 48:10.807
will pay off your debt.

48:10.891 --> 48:12.351
I'll take you home,

48:12.434 --> 48:13.810
and I'll bring the boat
back to them.

48:19.900 --> 48:22.528
Can't be that simple.

48:22.611 --> 48:24.530
Or thank you.

48:24.613 --> 48:26.865
You're welcome.

48:26.949 --> 48:28.325
